If it's too hard to be decent to your kids then you shouldn't be a parent. maybe u should've helped your abusive ex husband around the house more, maybe u shouldn't have had dinner 10 minutes late, bc you know his job is stressful and it's hard being a provider and father. Next.month is father's day you should call and reconcile with him. How could I as a child stop the abusive behavior of an adult when as an adult you couldn't stop your husband from abusing you.\" \n\nShe cried and walked off.

I have a strained relationship w my mother as well and it fucking grinds my gears when someone tells me I HAVE to make up with her because she\u2019s my mom. Friend needs to get out of her bubble and realize some parents just aren\u2019t good parents.\n\nEdit: ty all for the awards n upvotes! However, it is heartbreaking to know so many of us have estranged relationships with family members. Hope everything works out in the end for u all! Y\u2019all should never feel ashamed for cutting toxicity out of your life.", "No, she didn\u2019t mean well. **She assumed being a parent made her a specialist and thought she knew better than you about your own experience.**\n\nYou were not cruel, you help a mirror of how invalidating she was being in a way she understands. Now she gets it. And she doesn\u2019t here, because of her experiences.\n\nNTA - she didn\u2019t get it before. No matter how kindly you put it. I\u2019m betting now she has a full picture of what that ask really means to you.", "NTA:  Once your friend emotions started to fill with sadness, she should have realized that's the exact feeling she's giving to you each time she made those comments.  That's where she should have apologized", "Yea\u2026 she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d, so you tried to make her understand, by putting it in terms that meant something personal to her. And she didn\u2019t *like* it.\n\nWell, boo hoo, maybe next time she can try to have a little empathy before opening her mouth-or just trying being quiet in the first place. NTA", "NTA. A lot of people who make arguments like that (including the friend encouraging you to apologise to her) tend to be scared that in the future they'll be treated similarly. She's a Mom, she's afraid of her kids doing this to her. The friend is a friend, they're afraid of doing something to earn similar treatment. Unfortunately they choose to try and make you lessen your reaction instead of just making sure they don't earn the treatment.", "NTA. Well said. You spoke the truth and sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA - People really need to stop lecturing kids about reconsiling with abusive parents. It seems like it's socially acceptable to tell people who were abused that it is their responsibility to mend that relationship. Which is, of course, BS.", "NTA. You didn't take it too far. Your friend was way out of line.", "NTA\n\nBrilliant! Sometimes that's what it takes. \n\nShe is crying because having this growth experience is uncomfortable. You did nothing wrong. You gave her the chance to back off from her foolishness, but she pushed you. And now she understands how it feels. \n\nIf you lose her friendship, then it's because she is unwilling to understand what she was doing to you by guilting you about Mother's Day.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You both suffered from abuse, which is something neither of you deserved, but she dismissed your abuse and made excuses for your abuser and she was serious. You were not serious when telling her to forgive her ex, merely making a point and she couldn\u2019t handle it. Hopefully you finally got the point across and there won\u2019t be another again of you explaining this to her.", "NTA you are my hero!!! Everbody needs to hear this!!!", "You only said the exact same \"logic\" to her as she did to you.\n\nHow can you be anything else than NTA?", "NTA \n\nShe shouldn't of tried to pressure you into reconciling with your abusive parent, especially as someone who went through abuse. She didn't mean well at all, she wanted to feel superior over you. \n\nThe fact that she was victim blaming you is so toxic.", "Well, she understands now, doesn't she? NTA. Some people need a picture drawn for them before they begin to comprehend what someone else has experienced. The temerity of her and her defenders in judging you when they have not stood in your shoes. Maybe you should free yourself of people that don't have enough functioning neurons to understand that they know too little to have an informed opinion?", "NTA, everything you said was the truth", "No. NtA \n\nNot all parents are good parents. You shouldn't be forced to turn the other cheek just because they are your parents. \" family\" is not an excuse for abuse.\n\nIf this is what it took for her to understand this, is up to her and not you.", "NTA \n\nNow she understands and if it hurt her feelings then maybe she\u2019ll learn to mind her business in the future", "NTA, and kudos! I'm glad you took it there. Your friend needed a frame of reference!", "NTA. If she did not \u201cunderstand\u201d, you now set her straight. She actually should apologize now if she actually does understand that as a child you had even less ability to prevent abuse", "Nope NtA.

She may have had good intentions but it\u2019s not her place nor is it ok for her to push and push after you say no the first time.", "NTA and you didn't take it too far. What, does her trauma trump yours by dint of being more recent?\nDoes she get to poke your sore spot over and over but you don't get to say anything?\n\nYour mutual friend doesn't fully grasp what your mother did to you, or they wouldn't be saying this. Same for your meddlesome friend.", "NTA. No, you did not take it too far.", "NTA. I feel like maybe she's projecting her own fears onto you and your mom-- people who escape abusive situations often fear their kids will hate them for \"disrupting the status quo\" because the \"kids were happy enough.\" That doesn't mean she has the right to pressure you after you've been pretty blunt that it was abuse. It was way too far to suggest you were responsible for the abuse, and you using that same logic is harsh but a wake up call. It's clear you don't really believe it-- you were making a point because she keeps pressuring and blaming you.", "Absolutely NTA. Even if she didn\u2019t understand before, she does now. Everything you said true and consistent with her logic. I\u2019m sorry your mom sucked.", "Well done. As a DV survivor I wouldn't want to have it thrown in my face but with the pressure she was putting on you to call your Mother I think you used the only example she could understand. I hope she realizes she is wrong to get in the middle of your family dynamics. NTA.", "NTA and maybe I'm being cynical but I suspect your friend still doesn't understand your point of view otherwise she would have reached out to you and apologized.", "NTA\n\nYour friends is stupid as hell and ignorant of your feelings.", "NTA\n\nPeople who say \"let bygones be bygones\" don't seem to understand that abuse is not a \"bygone\" and it can take years, decades, to heal, and some never do.\n\nCould you have been more sensitive? Maybe, but when you have had to defend your position mutiple times, and someone either doesn't get it and/or won't let it drop, fur can fly.\n\nAnd if she \"doesn't understand\" as your other friends say, then WHY is she sticking her nose in, it's not an excuse, cause it wasn't her business in the first place.  though not understanding seems an odd defense, if she did suffer abuse from an ex, which says to me she's either projecting or deflecting and this isn't actually about you.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA - it may be harsh for someone who doesn't know what it is. But how can you blame a child for the abuse he received?!! I heard the same stupid statements from friends as well. And no, my parents behavior towards me wasn't my fault. And it wasn't your fault either.\n\nGosh did I heard it a lot \"you'll understand when you have kids\". 3 kids later and nope I didn't change my mind, they were just sh*t*y parents. Yes having kids is hard. But if you can refrain yourself from abusing them, don't have them.", "NTA. You state you had already explained the trauma you endured at the hands of your mother and her current obstinate refusal to address her past behaviors which caused you such pain. Repeatedly. \n\nYet your friend still had the sheer, unmitigated gall to suggest that *you* as a child should have taken on more adult responsibilities and claim that because \"Parenting is hard, y'all!\", your mother's abuse is both understandable and excusable!\n\nYour friend seemed to be empathizing with your mother based on the common frustrations inherent to parenthood rather than you based on the common trauma of abuse suffered at the hands of loved ones. You simply reframed and re-centered her perspective so she couldn't help but see how incredibly offensive she was being.\n\nThe only reason anything you said in your comparison with your friend's abusive ex was at all hurtful was because you used the very same logic she applied to your relationship with your mother. But that was the point; she needed to hear how incredibly insensitive she was being!\n\nAnd you are certainly allowed to be human and be a little \"pointed\" in your response to such rudeness.", "NTA. You know you're going to get a call or text demanding an apology for hurting your feelings. You tell her \"the hurt you feel rn is the hurt I felt when you talked to me about my mother.\"", "NTA. No, you did not take it too far.", "Not the asshole. You did not make her cry, she is responsible for her own emotional reactions.\n\nI wouldn't apologize to her beyond saying something bland like \"I'm sorry that things were heated and that I had to bring up your own history with abuse to make my point, but I hope you understand that I had to escalate because you were pressuring me on a very painful and sensitive subject for me and you were advocating for an unsafe choice that would have re-exposed me to my abuser.\" I think that language like this will help signal to mutual friends that you didn't wish to hurt her and don't wish her ill while also being clear that she was the one who violated your boundaries and offered unsolicited lectures about relationships that were none of her business.", "NTA. What a come back from your friend\u2019s stupid suggestion. You have ended the friendship, right?", "Harsh, but appropriate.  NTA", "Your friend suffers from a condition called not thinking before you open your mouth, and there's no cure at her age. NTA.", "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PETTY.\n\nKudos to you. I hope you find a better friend", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't take it too far.", "NTA.  Logic can be painful sometimes.  Hopefully she learned to think before giving unsolicited advice next time.", "NTA. I had very similar conversations with several people before. Usually they grew up in a loving home and lowkey still dependent on their parents so could not fathom the idea that a child could alienate themselves from their parents.", "NTA. Abuse is not ok, _**ESPECIALLY**_ from your parents!", "Some people just can't understand another person's situation unless they see themselves in the example.  Good job on explaining it to her.  She gets it now.  NTA.", "NTA.  She knew that was a hot-button topic for you and she pushed it.  You're not responsible for the fact that she couldn't handle what she triggered when she kept pushing.  \n\nWe don't get to choose our parents and we don't all get the Brady Bunch or Leave It to Beaver tv show parents.  If we're lucky, they're somewhere in the middle of those two, but many of us get parents that \\*no one\\* should ever have to live with.  You went non-contact for reasons that are very valid to you - and you don't need to justify them to anyone else.", "NTA, and you need better friends. This person sounds like those annoying people you meet who are into toxic positivity and act like nothing bad has ever happened to them. I hope you find some better friends who can get a clue.", "NTA maybe on some level she thinks she should be able to treat her children however or subject them to someone who mistreats them, etc., without consequence \u2014 that they should forgive her. That no matter what, she is redeemable. Her viewpoint on your situation probably has less to do with you and more to do with her own choices and life.", "NTA. Sometimes people don\u2019t understand until you frame it in a way they can.", "NTA.", "NTA I bet she understands now", "NTA", "NTA - \n\n>she \"meant well and didn't understand, and you took it too far\"\n\nShe didn't understand, so you put it in a way that would *make* her understand. She obviously wasn't going to get it any other way. Honestly you handled that situation better than a lot of people would. Just hearing about it makes me irrationally angry. \n\nYou said to her what she had basically been saying to you, now that she's crying, maybe it'll get through her head why what's she's been saying has been awfully wrong. Nta", "NTA you did perfect. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty that she cried.\n\nWhat she suggested was victim blaming - a child victim at that! And then when told she was offensively hurtful and wrong and exactly clearly why she couldn't handle it.\n\nI would hope she's questioning a lot about her thought process right now and that you get a thoughtful apology.", "NTA, it was harsh, but she refused to hear you until you MADE yourself be heard.  As a fellow child of an abusive mother, AND a mother myself, let me reiterate that no one OWES their mother anything.  Even if they are good mothers, or great mothers, we owe them nothing.  And I tell my now grown kids the same thing.  I said to my kids that while I love when they spend time with me, I know that they don't owe me a fucking thing.  You did and continue to do what YOU needed OP.  So NTA", "NTA\n\nI ended up in tears for most of the day yesterday because a loved family member spent her visit with me attempting to convince me to reconcile with my mother and siblings. \n\nWhether your friend understands your position or not doesnt matter. She simply doesn't have the right to decide what boundaries of yours are malleable or not. She also doesnt have the right to insist you do something just because she wants you to.\n\nI applaud you for your answer to her. And say it again louder for the friends who dont think she overstepped her mark.\n\nI hope it didnt ruin your day too much. It can be difficult when something like this happens as it can leave you revisiting parts of your life you simply dont want to. Hugs to you, stay strong and continue to protect yourself x", "NTA. She was victim-blaming you and didn\u2019t like it when you did the same to her. Boo hoo for your friend. Let her know that this is how YOU feel when she does it to you.", "NTA. I have never wanted children. A co-worker kept harassing me about it, saying I  would regret it, kids are great, your mom instincts will kick in as soon as you look at it, blah, blah, blah. Finally, I had to lie and tell her I couldn't have children. That finally shut her up.", "NTA. Don't dish what you can't take.", "NTA. Being abused is horrible and her saying something like that even though she has lived with an abusive person before is fucked up. She is in crazy denial. Either way she is wrong drop her.", "NTA I have been NC with my emotionally abusive father for 20ish years now. Have had friends and girlfriends try to encourage me to reconcile with him over the years and have had to use similar tactics to shut people down before. Your friend learned a hard lesson and should be thanking you.", "NTA. Also not that it matters because you don\u2019t need to be a parent to understand your relationship with your parent, but everyone I know who has kids and had shit parents are even more annoyed at them, not more understanding.", "NTA.    Reconciliation is something that should be done on YOUR time, when (IF) you feel it's warranted.  She has no right to dictate how, when or if you decide to change your relationship with your mother, and using her argument back at her was not unjustified at all.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nParenting IS difficult, agreed.  But abuse is NEVER justified.", "NTA.\n\nYou broke the bubble on a summer child.  You did a good thing.", "NTA- as someone who still has a wonderful and healthy relationship with both parents. I would never tell anyone else that, each parent is different some for the best and (in this case )some for the worst. Sometimes the best thing is to stay no contact and she shouldn\u2019t have used her thought process and logic and pressure if she already got an answer multiple times.", "NTA. What she was saying was no different. You only went as far as she did. It\u2019s not your fault she couldn\u2019t understand how horrible she was being until you put into terms she could understand.", "Nta. Abuse is abuse whether its from a parent or a spouse. Her logic is logic used by someone whose abusive and to be an abuse survivor herself, and use that type of logic is gross and hypocritical", "NTA. And I believe she makes her eldest child parent her younger ones, if she has more than one kid.", "NTA.  Some people don't get that parents can, in fact, abuse their children.  They don't want to get it because the concept seems so alien to people who haven't experienced it or known anyone who has experienced it.  Her comments come off as victim-blaming and that's messed up in cases like this, like it could ever be a child's fault that they were abused when all they did was be born to the wrong set of parents, which they obviously had no control over.", "ESH She may have been wrong to butt in on your relationship or lack thereof with your mother, but you intentionally targeted something you knew would hurt her to make your point. \n\nIf you thought what she did was wrong, why did you seek to attack her the same way? If she is the asshole, you joined her in the club.", "A child has no idea what abuse and how they can stop it  an adult can. Your logic was much more stronger than hers and she couldn't take it.", "ESH - you absolutely needed to put your foot down and make it clear that you will never reconcile with your mother, and she needs to move on. Throwing your friend's abuse in her face was not the way to do it", "ESH. \n\nIt\u2019s 100% clear that your friend shouldn\u2019t have been lecturing you are even mentioning reconciling with your mother. \n\nThat said, I just don\u2019t think that makes it less of a jerk move to throw her abusive ex husband in her face.", "Absolutely NTA! \n\nI've come to meet many people who cannot accept that I've cut contact with my grandparents because they are horrible, abusive people. They would always tell me that my grandparents are probably not the same anymore, and wouldn't accept my decision of keeping no contact.  Those people always stopped pestering me when I explicitly went through some empathy exercises with them telling them to imagine they are a child again and their grandparents did xyz (listing of what my grandparents did in detail). Afterwards I asked them how they felt about it, and if they could forgive those acts. Most of them had to agree they couldn't forgive those acts, and the ones who disagreed are no longer in my life.\n\nAll you did is reframe your trauma to trauma she understood. Was it harsh? Yes. Was it needed? Absolutely fruitly it was! You did good.", "NTA\n\n\nBeing a parent doesn\u2019t mean she can parent you around. If she wanted to give an (unsolicited) advice, it would have been fine if she did it once and and after you explained why you did what you did, she let it go. \n\n\n\nBut no. She badgered you into believing that you could have done more so that abuse didn\u2019t happen or to forgive your abuser became its in the past. You are right in your logic id she is pestering you by pointing out that she should do the same with her ex husband then since it\u2019s in the past and she could have \u201cavoided\u201d it by doing things differently.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are an asshole but at the same time I get why you did it.", "Sometimes, one of the shapes of compassion is wrath. \n\nYour \"friend\" was completely lacking in empathy and only seeing things from her own selfish perspective fueled by her own insecurities and fears and projecting them upon you.\n\nShe was not concerned about your relationship with your narcissist mother at all but using you to play out her insecurities about her future relationship with her children. \n\nIn the art of Aikido, we turn into an attack and redirect its energy back to its source. What you did was a kind of verbal Aikido.  She was forced to confront the violence she did to you by having it reflected towards her.\n\nAnd instead of the empathetic response of realizing how she was hurting you, she once again had the selfish reaction of how it affected her.\n\nYour \"friend\" does not have your best interests in mind.

I feel bad for her kids.", "NTH.  As someone who went no contact with my family for self preservation, toxic family is so destructive to your mental health. I suffered abuse and my family wants me to forgive and never bring it up or blame me or say it never happened. I am almost 60 and it still eats at me. I have been in therapy, and while I know I was powerless against what happened, it wasn't my fault and that everyone deserves a family's love and protection. Unfortunately,  there are more ppl out there like us than most people know. Maybe say to your friend, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but please leave it alone.
