Neither is the best idea financially but you are setting yourself up for failure here. When your father should have backed you up with your mother after you explained the things she messed up, it should have been the end of the matter. He did not.

They may be entitled to half of your house.\n\nThis whole situation sounds like dynamite. Make sure you've got all your bases covered before it explodes, and don't put any more money into the property until you know your rights.\n\nAnd if you do own the property, get a nice fence and keep everything locked up.", "I think it\u2019s solely OP\u2019s house (which could be considered personal property, not real estate, check your tax laws) but the land is owned by OP + parent(s).\n\nOP, NTA, and check with your builder about how portable your house is because I\u2019m thinking your next post is gonna be about that."]}
