You need to document the things bad things he tells your kids about you.

Tell him calmly that calling his new gf their mother is completely inappropriate- and that the negative things he says about you is upsetting the children; which is why they're telling you.  It's parental alienation- something the family courts would be very interested in. Nip this in the bud and document his response, OP. NTA", "Nta. He doesn't sound like that great of a guy if he is bad mouthing you to your children. \n\nBut the mom thing is totally innapropiate. She's not their mother in literally any sense and she has no obligation to these kids beyond what she feels like doing for/with them. Her role is to.be your exs partner and a positive role model for these kids. Her role was.never and will never be to be their mother. Even if she became their step mother, that does not mean she's needed to be a parent. \n\nNow if you don't trust him to tell you the truth you need to focus on your kids. Tell them that's a no, they need to respect this woman but she's not their parent. And if she makes them uncomfortable to.continue to let you know. Reaffirm the boundaries and their right to having boundaries.", "NTA - The best thing to do is address this as it comes up and don't draw it out too far with the kids.  \nHave a really basic conversation with the kids and your ex present, just have them share with the dad what they said to you and they can tell him they don't feel comfortable with it.   \n\n\nIt's insanely important that the kids be involved ( esp the 11yr old ) in that conversation because at the end of the day you can't effectively coparent if the kids are on the outside of every conversation.. I am speaking from making waaaay too many mistakes in a similar situation and wish I could go back and resolve many of them.", "NTA. Clearly, you're just looking out for your children's well-being and emotional health.

My daughter is the same age, and also co parenting. But they both know they only have 1 dad and 1 mom. They understand that, but also talk to the dad about it, and ask him how it would feel for him if you had a new boyfriend who the kids had to call dad. I think he will get the point very fast.

I would talk to the father first, you know that thing grown-ups do. Talk it out and if the guy keeps on doing it then you can take it to the next step.  It's only been a few months.

He regularly dobs in his dad/me/granny for saying stuff. I do not pull it out of him with questions. He also remembers things I said off-hand 6 months before. Not every 6 year old is a forgetful liar, even if you've known one that was.", "I believe that if you can't afford an attorney in family court they'll assign you one, but don't quote me on that, I recommend going to /r/legaladvice . Are you not getting child support from him? If the income disparity is as large as you make it sound, you really should be getting a sizeable amount of child support. And, if you are really getting screwed as far as child support is concerned, you might be able to find a lawyer who's willing to work for contingency.\n\nAs far as wanting your kids to have a real relationship with their dad, let me tell you from my own personal experience: Sometimes no relationship is better than one filled emotional manipulation, neglect and abuse. Your ex is not a good person. A good person wouldn't be saying those things to your kids about you. He is almost definitely a narcissist.", "Wanted to chime in .. Parental Alienation is WAAAAAYYY overused, if you look at the case law I'd bet 19/20 times it gets brought up in court it doesn't go anywhere. It's easy to look at the definition online and get sucked into spending 10s of thousands on attorneys and counselors etc though... In the end  yours will say maybe it is ( mainly since you will be paying them for court testimony) , and he'll have one that says no it isn't and your kids will be sucked between both...  \nIf this was happening there would be no friendly coparenting and it almost never happens in somewhat evenly split custody (or the one with lesser time).\n\nWhat you have here is a simple case of a new GF who is overstepping bounds it sounds like, and my experience is that kids are very good at that age of playing parents against each other if you don't communicate.", "I absolutely disagree.  It's completely your business what kind of parent he is and who he brings into their lives.  Your attitude is so beyond \"hands off\" and is irresponsible.", "Family court might be different from state to state but where I live it's a civil matter ( opposed to criminal ) , and you don't  get an attorney if you can't afford one.  \nThere are programs out there and charities/lawyers who work pro bono though, but that also varies from state to state and ymmv there.\n\nAs far as child support goes that's super simple, pretty much every state has a calculator, plug in the numbers and go. If you are divorced you likely already have some sort of parenting plan in place and all that should have been worked out anyway around the number of days etc.  \n\n\nPeople to recommend court and attorneys to get engaged in most cases never have had to pay an attorney in an contentious case before, I could tell you my story it would blow your mind what it took to get full custody of my son... You would think 3-4x along the path it any of the things would be enough ( ie one example was that she had a crackhead roommate who got busted with meth in a kitchen drawer and had illegal guns ( he was a felon ) in  at my ex's house ( where my son lived 80% of the time)  that was found after breaking into the next door neighbors house at 3pm through and upstairs window with the police report stating all that ... that wasn't even close to enough to give some perspective.. )", "I wasn't getting parental alienation from what he said about his new GF, I got it from this:\n\n> Our kids also tell me all the negative things he says about me so I can only imagine what he tells his now gf about me. \n\n> I get triggered when my kids tell me about what he says about me in front of them.\n\nIf this isn't parental alienation, then nothing is.", "I think you might be taking what OP is saying as very specific rather than a general comment. OP's ex can date who he wants, introduce them to his kids when he wants to, and have whatever rules he wants for his children while they are in his care (so long as their welfare is not in jeopardy). I think that's what OP means, as opposed to \"what he does with the children is none of my business\".", "Yeah I get what you are saying there if you just looked up the online definition it's one symptom however, I went down this path in a legal scenario and what I can tell you is that any attorney ( unless they are just wanting to take your money )  will tell you what was said here is no where close to enough to get that type of ruling from a judge.  \n\n\nTrust me .. it's a battle that's not cheap (25k for me ) and you have to prove the intent of those bad things was said to change the perception of the child's view of the other parent not just because someone is bitter. In the few cases you see where it did get pulled into the mix and read the depositions you would see the kid saying something like  \"mom was really proud of me getting a good grade\" the dad would say \" your mom really isn't proud she told me that you could have done better but didn't want to hurt your feelings, she's super disappointed\" .  Also the VAST majority of the times happens when one parent has a disproportional amount of time with the kid and it's the primary custodial parent who is the one doing the alienation.\n\nThe ops description definitely didn't feel like that was the intent of the dad to do that, and likely is a kid ( she stated the 11yr old was over there more frequently ) pitting parent against parent. Long story short though you can definitely say negative things about the other parent and it not be parental alienation, it can just be a turd thing to do ( sounds like the case here ).", "Yes! Exactly what I wanted to say! I\u2019m not very good with explaining. Thank you so much for replying! All I care about is the well being of my kids, especially emotionally!"]}
