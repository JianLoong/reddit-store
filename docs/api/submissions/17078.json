I split my time 50/50 between both houses. My mom has been remarried for a number of years now and has three stepkids. Two boys who are younger and a girl the same age as me. She and I got along so badly that the custody times were switched so we were not in the house at the same time because we could not get along. It all started with her taking my favorite plush animal without permission and ruining it (the eyes were gone and it got soaked which ruined the color). When I told her she shouldn't have taken it she made it her mission to take my stuff without asking and rarely had any consequences for it because I was told to share. Some of the stuff was fine but other stuff got ruined too.\n\nWhen my mom told me that she would still sleep in the room after the change in custody when I wasn't there I knew I did not want the important stuff left at my mom's so I took it all to my dad's with me. I was 12 at the time.\n\nThis was only discovered a few weeks ago. Apparently dear old stepsis has been trying to find the goods for years but it was when her dad said I should have a game console there, that was given by my grandparents and they couldn't find it, they realized what I had done. I was confronted by my mom and her husband and I admitted it. I told them I didn't trust that girl with my stuff and moved it all to safety. My mom asked how stuff is safe when my dad has two stepsons at home. I said because they're not allowed to go through my stuff and because they're good guys who wouldn't do that. My mom's husband was like what are you saying about my daughter. I told him that he's known for years what we think of each other.\n\nMom called my grandparents and asked what they thought of the console going to my dad's. They said they were fine with it. At least it was safe.\n\nMom told me I should have told them my concerns and worked out a better solution than pretty much emptying my room. She also said surely there is stuff I am willing to share. I said not with stepsis. Mom told me I wasn't being very fair and how are we ever going to have a good sister relationship if we don't trust each other. I told mom we won't, because we're not sisters, we will never be sisters and I don't ever want to be.\n\nMy mom and her husband think I'm an AH for doing this so I gotta ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1683923109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fw0vf/aita_for_removing_the_fun_stuff_from_my_room_at/", "score": 8489, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My things never got broken though so I cannot imagine how much worse it must be for you having to share your space when you\u2019re not there & having her break your things. Your mum needs to sort her priorities out. I\u2019m so sorry that no one on here can do anything other than validate your feelings & reassure you that you 100% did the right thing.

None of your step bros seem to have an issue with boundaries.  I\u2019m sure your stepsister is going through something.

I\u2019m proud of you for coming up with a solution to keep your belongings safe. Also major kudos to you for standing up to your Mother and Stepfather. Keep it up!!", "NTA.  Your mom and her husband are the a- holes.  They need to parent your stepsister and let her know she has no right to touch your stuff.  Its pretty basic courtesy we all have to learn:  if it\u2019s not yours, don\u2019t touch unless you get permission.", "No, NTA honey! But, mom and step dad are!! Thank God for real dad and grand parents!!", "NTA, well done, and hoping you can go NC as soon as you're off to college from 'dear old mum'.", "When you turn 16 have your dad look into getting you legally emancipated from your mother!!!", "NTA.  I don't get it, why wouldn't you have Your stuff wherever You choose?  The stepsister issue is irrelevant here imo.", "NTA\n\nStep sis has no consequences for ruining your things. They were informed of the situation. They forced you to share with someone who was purposely destroying your things. Your mother & her husband are the assholes. I find it funny that your grandparents said \"at least they know it's safe.\" That in itself should state what everyone knows is true. The husbands daughter is not to be trusted with your belongings.", "NTA. They should've found a better solution years ago. Taking everything to your dad's was a smart idea.", "NTA, since her taking and ruining your stuff was considered \"sharing\" to your mom.  Sounds like \"sharing\" was a one way street.  Too bad your mom didn't have your back.  Since it's been years, can you live full time with your dad?", "Real talk? Your mom is the AH. \n\nYou are absolutely NTA. You are a child. It's ridiculous that your mom would treat you like this and go as far as calling your grandparents, hoping they would back her up. I'm glad they didn't. You are absolutely entitled to your stuff and you are allowed to have boundaries. Is sharing caring? Sure it is. But your stepsis isn't sharing, she's taking. And having healthy boundaries and more important than sharing. Being selfish is not a negative trait and in this situation you should absolutely be selfish. If she's not going to respect you and your things then she should not have access to them. \n\nI'm so sorry you're in this situation. I hope your mom sees this and realizes she should be more respectful of your feelings.", "I think you recognized a problem and you solved it.\n\nYou deserve credit", "NTA - your mom is wrong here on SO many levels!", "NTA. You don't have to share your things with people who are destructive. Stepsis seemd like she intends to continuously break your stuff. I don't blame you for hiding your stuff", "NTA and I absolutely admire your chutzpah!", "NTA. When parents refuse to parent, you have to handle your issues yourself. You did that effectively. There is nothing they need to be complaining about.", "NTA. You don\u2019t trust her because she ruins things you are forced to \u201cshare \u201c with her. You don\u2019t have a good relationship with her because she ruins your things. You don\u2019t leave anything consequential at your mother\u2019s house because your step sister ruins your things and faces no consequences. What you are saying to your stepdad by your actions is that you don\u2019t trust your belongings around his daughter because she ruins stuff. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he needs to start giving her consequences for ruining your stuff.  Forced sharing has never led to anything other than resentment. If they want you to have a better relationship with your step sister they need therapy and they need to teach her to respect other people.", "NTA. Step-sister is not related to you and there is no reason that you have to have any relationship with her at all. Whatever her issue is, that is not on you and you have every right to protect your property since your mother lets her use the same room as you and does nothing to protect your things. \n\nThey can't force you to like her or for her to like you. Your step-father predictably will say HIS daughter is a lovely, wonderful child and you are the one in the wrong. Again, NOT YOUR PROBLEM.   \n\nAnd as mentioned, since things aren't that good at your mother's, talk to your dad about getting the custody arrangements changed. You are old enough that a judge is going to lean heavily on your opinion.", "definitely NTA, i\u2019d do the same in your spot", "NTA\n\n>Apparently dear old stepsis has been trying to find the goods for years but **it was when her dad said I should have a game console there**, that was given by my grandparents **and they couldn't find it**, they realized what I had done.\n\nSo, not only was stepsis going through your things without your permission, **her father was encouraging her** to...", "NTA\n\nYou have gone to them in the past and were told to share. If they want a game console in their house, I suggest they buy one.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m sorry you had to take such measures to begin with. The way I see you did what they refused to do and that was find a solution. \n\nGood on you for holding your ground.", "NTA your mom and step dad are out of line. \n\nMaybe try tell them straight up, you guys put me in a bad situation.  You don\u2019t like the step sister, you don\u2019t have too. It makes no sense to share a room with here. Why would you leave your good stuff for her to go through while you\u2019re not there. Don\u2019t feel obliged to share with her no matter what your mom says. She is being a bit manipulative here in my opinion. \n\nI\u2019d speak up to your dad about all this. Maybe he could have a chat with them both. Say it\u2019s impacting your relationship with your mom.", "NTA:  The way you type/monologue you are mature, maybe beyond your years?  You are setting good boundaries and they would not be boundaries kept if you left your stuff there.  Kudos.  This will be wisdom that goes with you as you form your own relationships and bonds.  Parents may never get it, but with time the hope is that they will grow and change as you are growing and changing.", "Your solution has worked for years and they\u2019ve never even noticed. I\u2019m also really confused on what they expected your grandparents to do. \n\nMom and stepdad need to accept your stepsis has a nasty habit of touching and breaking other peoples belongings, and that has consequences. The fact your stepdad is surprised you think this makes her a bad person tells me the apple probably didn\u2019t fall to far from the tree. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou just don't want your stuff broke or missing. Where's stepsister's stuff? Why's she need your belongings? If mom and stepdad want her to have nice things, they can buy them for her. \n\nYou're allowed to have your own belongings and a say in where they are/who uses them.", "NTA it\u2019s your stuff you can keep it wherever you want. If your parents want to rebuild trust and help you and your stepsister work on your relationship they can do it a different way that doesn\u2019t involve your stuff. \n\nMaybe they can buy something cool \u201cfor the room.\u201d You can know full well it might get destroyed and manage your attachment and expectations of the item. Or maybe your step sister will grow and earn back your trust. But that\u2019s up to her.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because she\u2019s a step sibling. It\u2019s because she\u2019s an individual who took certain actions and so you are preparing in case she takes future similar actions.\n\nI will say that \u201caround 12\u201d can be a time when some kids aren\u2019t very nice. It can be for a lot of reasons. I was personally a nightmare. But I like to think I grew, matured, and learned. You don\u2019t have to, but it might be worth it to keep trying with your stepsister. She might grow out if it in time. Just do it in a way that feels safe to you.", "Bahahaha NTA \n\n\nThis is brilliant. Good on you for effective problem solving and for standing your ground.", "NTA. You asked for help and got none, so you solved your own problem. And wow, how checked out are your mother and her husband, that they haven't looked in your room in 4 years?", "NTA\n\nShe ruined a sentimental object. Enough said. I will never understand why society forces kids to share. Adults aren\u2019t forced to share.", "NTA. You DID tell them your concerns. They told you to \"share\". She's a nightmare and needs to be put in her place and parented correctly.", "NTA.  Anyone, \"family\" or otherwise, who deliberately wrecks your stuff and says \"But I was just sharing!\" deserves to have your stuff off limits.    \n\n\nI don't know what your mom is thinking, but she should have laid down the law the first time your step sis wrecked one of your things.  It takes work to get the eyes off a stuffie.  She did that on purpose and it was mean.  Your mom was too busy hoping for a Perfect Family to set down rules and boundaries to actually make it easier for you to get along.  \n\n\nBecause your mom wouldn't protect your nice things, you came up with a great solution.  \n\n  \nMaybe someday if Step Sis **proves that she can be trusted** not to destroy your game console, then maybe she can borrow it.  But that's a big IF, given her track record!", "NTA at all. Mom didn\u2019t care when you tried to say something before, so why should you believe her now? Don\u2019t bring your stuff back\u2014sounds like step-sis will come back with a vengeance.

My mom lived in one of the trailers and I slept on the couch in the living room/kitchen of the house. Behind the house lived a drug addled woman in her 40s named Kelly. Every day I would be woken up to her picking up my few possessions I was able to keep from moving so much and put them outside in a dilapidated canvas shed we had on the side of the house. The shed itself was filled with mold, rats, spiders, cat piss from feral cats, and the elements. Nobody could or would stop her and as such, any possessions I owned that were not destroyed by her that I loved were given to friends because I never felt worth the things I was given as they were likely to be destroyed. With the permissiveness of my parents came a sense of loss of personal identity and the loss of the ability to feel as though I ever truly owned anything. \n\nAs I got older with the few possessions I retained I hated allowing anyone to use them. My partners were never allowed to use my phone, wear my clothes, eat my food, and I didn't allow people to borrow things unless I was willing to flat out give it to them. I only decided to make a change when I got into my relationship with my husband. We started the relationship with me being very territorial with my possessions but I got into therapy, got medication for my anxiety, and am now able to freely share my things including the money I make.

That is usually a massive sign of some serious distress (but not usually this kind of distress, it's usually the really, really sad newspaper article kind of distress).  I'm honestly surprised she has to do split custody at all, there is no way those parents could pretend to be suitable in court without her advocating, and it sounds like she does the exact opposite of that.

My other son who is autistic is much higher functioning and has a more moderated response.  He shares happily as long as you respect his stuff.  It bugs me when people in general aren't willing to acknowledge the difference is simply due to their developmental differences.  It's not that we expect others to accept poor behavior from the middle child, but we do expect them to understand that the difference exists.

Unfortunately, those programs are underfunded and are constantly losing even more funding so people aren't getting the aide they need. If a couple has a better chance of being approved for a lease or mortgage with their combined income and credit as spouses, than being approved for government assistance, (that often isn't enough funds to cover the bills) and gain access to healthcare FASTER by getting married rather than waiting for welfare approval or their kids to afford to move out, they should get married.

So marrying someone is not the only way a person can get healthcare.\n\n> If newly divorced single parents are supposed to wait until their children who live with them, are living on their own, where is that family supposed to live in the meantime, while they wait for the children to afford homes of their own?\n\nThe same place they live prior to meeting the person they might want to marry.  Wherever they live while dating does not suddenly vanish for them to have to marry to have shelter.  \n\n> I know you're not a dictator, but I believe you dictated your opinion.\n\nSo by definition, if I speak like I actually know what I\u2019m talking about, I dictated the opinion.

I mean step sis is clearly at fault here, so why mom and husband aren\u2019t talking to her, instead of OP?

How the stepdad said, \"what are you saying about my daughter?\" Maybe I'm reading too much into this but it sounded aggressive. And to his step-child!

How are they gonna go criticize OP for refusing to play house, and he goes and so blatantly sides with his bio kid even though his kid is the problem?", "I\u2019m so delighted you have someone to trust. A mom figure that never pushed to be the mom. My daughters have a horrible relationship with their father.

Sometimes these non parents wake up right as you turn 16 and go bizarre with overwhelming you.

How many years did it take before anyone noticed?", "NTA\n\nI would go even further to prove your point to your mother and step-father by bringing things you don\u2019t care about as much and leaving it at theirs to see if it gets destroyed/damaged.

OP, I'm sorry your mum and step father have not listened to you.", "Lol. What is this crazy idea about \"having to share\"? You are not siblings.

You told them your boundaries and took steps to enforce them. It took me until 24 to do the same.", "NTA\n\nAsshole mom keeps hearing from you directly how your stuff is being ruined and intruded upon, custody agreements are changed in court over it(how does your mom operate at this level of denial?!?!) And she's so uninvested in you as her daughter she doesn't even notice how her own child lives under her own roof(she doesn't notice you have almost nothing in your room). \n\nYour mom is checked out of the mother-daughter relationship. She needs to be called out on that. She's trying to turn it around on you for not sharing. \n\nShe didn't even notice it was an issue for years, that you, her daughter lived with clothes and lesser valuables of the things you own, that you'd raised your concerns to have them fall on deaf ears. Of course you were gonna arrange things in your favour(your safety and peace of mind) than let someone else abuse your stuff or bully you by intentionally ruining it. And your mom can't see this? \n\nYou need to reframe this for your mom, like. Mom, if you worked in an office and had a coworker who destroyed your stuff what would you do? If you have a laptop and they wait til you go home before smashing some buttons(analogy for your plushie), you'd be upset, right? You'd go to your boss(when you approached your mom) and ask for help and intervention. Your boss does nothing(your mom waived your concerns off). Your mom doesn't want her work equipment destroyed so she'd put it in a company locker or take it home with her so it's safe(you taking stuff to your dad's). Along comes the president of the company(your grandparents) who gift your mom a new company laptop(you getting your console) and your mom decides to take it home with her so it can't be smashed(you keeping it at your dad's). \n\nIt's stupid, but I've seen and met adults who just don't \"click\" what the issues are til it affects them directly, til they were the target. And during discussions like this they'd be all \"but it's not like that, but I don't have a company laptop\" that's all BS for \"I don't want to think about this, I don't want to admit it\". Of course situations aren't the exact same, but it's an analogy not a direct rehashing of it, it's so she can visualise what it's like to be in your shoes and if they refuse to even consider your views, then arguing with them is lost. There can be no enlightenment there. If that's the case, I'd seek new custody and stay with dad full time, coz it means mom just doesn't care, what she cares about is appeasing your stepsisters wants over your needs for safety.\n\nFor your mom, it doesn't even have to come down to one daughter against the other, it's just common decency and respect between people and an expected standard of behaviour needs to be set in the house for all to follow and if that were the case, stuff wouldn't get ruined or destroyed/damaged. The fact that you are stepsisters is just how your mom is viewing things, and it doesn't enter into the real issue. It could happen between any two people of any genders or relationship. \n\nNTA. But your mom is an AH.", "Resounding NTA", "I don't  know how old are you, but good job kid, definitely not the AH. Your mom and stepdad on the other hand...major AH vibes...they ask your grandparents if they were ok with their gift to be at your father's house but they didn't bother asking you if your  stepsister is allowed to use your stuff ...", "NTA I like how your mum says you should of voiced your concerns but when u did you got told just to share. More like you voiced but they didn\u2019t want to listen.", "NTA, if your mom and step dad want her to have a console THEY should buy her a damn console. I truly think that's all this is actually about. I mean how do you not notice for YEARS that your child has essentially emptied their room?\n\nObviously if you can't be in the house together AND your parents have been going with that for years, again, they can't expect you both to magically form trust and sisterly love . There simply hasn't been an environment for that and that my dear is on them not you. Protect your shit and thank goodness for your dad's safe haven..", "NTA. The icing on the cake is that it took your mom years to realized you don\u2019t have anything you like at her house. Probably after your step sister complained", "YTA for writing that much", "My older brother went into my room and took and ruined stuff that was important to me. When I started stopping him from having access to my stuff, he went to my mom and complained, and she tried to scold me and punish me for it, with my brother standing behind her shoulder with a large, cruel grin.\n\nHis next step was moving into my room when I wasn't there - moving all my things that he didn't want into the living room. He had his own room and no reason to do this.\n\nWhen I returned home and saw this I immediately rang my dad and asked him to just come and help me move out there and then. I was home alone and seized the opportunity. It wasn't like I was welcome there or had any adults who wanted to protect me there.

Have you tried having your dad talk to your mom and stepdad?", "Isn\u2019t OP allowed to have a say about custody at the age? If she hates her stepdad and stepsister, and her mom is picking the latter\u2019s side, custody at mom doesn\u2019t have much going for it anymore. OP has started distancing themselves from that side of the family years ago and I hope she\u2019ll be able to regain a good relationship before it ends up in NC.\n\nOP is NTA.", "I'm assuming OPs maternal grand parents paid for said game console ? so im sure mom was thinking hey its my family theyll side with me and now she looks silly in front of everyone as I am guessing that OPs grandparents don't buy their step kids gaming consoles ?", "It sounds like your stepfather and mother are really just all-around awful parents, if the two brothers can't even get along and destroy each other's things. Keep on doing what you are doing and you will be old enough to leave soon enough. \n\nBased on everything you say here, you are definitely NTA.", "Are you sure that's a fact, and not only what your mum tells you? Because once you've reached a certain age, if you decide to stay at your dad's and refuse to go to mum nobody will force you to go, even if custody is shared.", "OP's mom and OP's stepdad don't want to do the tough part of parenting: saying no, and dealing with the resulting shitfit. So they shifted responsibility onto OP and are mad she has a backbone because it shows how weak they are", "yeah i have no fucking clue what my kiddo has or doesn't have unless he says something \ud83d\ude02", "My dad told me. He looked into it.", "That varies area to area. But a lot operate like you said. I\u2019d say some jurisdictions try to preserve family relationships and that\u2019s what OP is encountering. Kinda sucks too. Because at a certain point teenagers know a living situation is untenable when the courts don\u2019t see it.", "did the immediately act on her complaints?  or do they seem to be fairly absentee to all the kids", "Was wondering that too.

They also acted pretty quickly when the boys weren't getting along.", "You can even tell that he see no issue with giving his kid stuff that's isn't her to have/use because he told her about the console, why would it ever come up? I bet if she had broken it they would have pretended like it just stopped working for no apparent reason and would have replaced it. I am 110% sure that if op did something similar he would blow a fuse."]}
