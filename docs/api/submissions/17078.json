I split my time 50/50 between both houses. My mom has been remarried for a number of years now and has three stepkids. Two boys who are younger and a girl the same age as me. She and I got along so badly that the custody times were switched so we were not in the house at the same time because we could not get along. It all started with her taking my favorite plush animal without permission and ruining it (the eyes were gone and it got soaked which ruined the color). When I told her she shouldn't have taken it she made it her mission to take my stuff without asking and rarely had any consequences for it because I was told to share. Some of the stuff was fine but other stuff got ruined too.\n\nWhen my mom told me that she would still sleep in the room after the change in custody when I wasn't there I knew I did not want the important stuff left at my mom's so I took it all to my dad's with me. I was 12 at the time.\n\nThis was only discovered a few weeks ago. Apparently dear old stepsis has been trying to find the goods for years but it was when her dad said I should have a game console there, that was given by my grandparents and they couldn't find it, they realized what I had done. I was confronted by my mom and her husband and I admitted it. I told them I didn't trust that girl with my stuff and moved it all to safety. My mom asked how stuff is safe when my dad has two stepsons at home. I said because they're not allowed to go through my stuff and because they're good guys who wouldn't do that. My mom's husband was like what are you saying about my daughter. I told him that he's known for years what we think of each other.\n\nMom called my grandparents and asked what they thought of the console going to my dad's. They said they were fine with it. At least it was safe.\n\nMom told me I should have told them my concerns and worked out a better solution than pretty much emptying my room. She also said surely there is stuff I am willing to share. I said not with stepsis. Mom told me I wasn't being very fair and how are we ever going to have a good sister relationship if we don't trust each other. I told mom we won't, because we're not sisters, we will never be sisters and I don't ever want to be.\n\nMy mom and her husband think I'm an AH for doing this so I gotta ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1683923109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fw0vf/aita_for_removing_the_fun_stuff_from_my_room_at/", "score": 2150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your step sister has proven that she doesn\u2019t respect you of your personal items like your stuffie and you have every right to move it to a safe place. You can say your brothers respect your items and privacy so that\u2019s why you felt ok with leaving things there Instead.

My things never got broken though so I cannot imagine how much worse it must be for you having to share your space when you\u2019re not there & having her break your things. Your mum needs to sort her priorities out. I\u2019m so sorry that no one on here can do anything other than validate your feelings & reassure you that you 100% did the right thing.

None of your step bros seem to have an issue with boundaries.  I\u2019m sure your stepsister is going through something.

I\u2019m proud of you for coming up with a solution to keep your belongings safe. Also major kudos to you for standing up to your Mother and Stepfather. Keep it up!!", "NTA.  Your mom and her husband are the a- holes.  They need to parent your stepsister and let her know she has no right to touch your stuff.  Its pretty basic courtesy we all have to learn:  if it\u2019s not yours, don\u2019t touch unless you get permission.", "No, NTA honey! But, mom and step dad are!! Thank God for real dad and grand parents!!", "NTA, well done, and hoping you can go NC as soon as you're off to college from 'dear old mum'.", "When you turn 16 have your dad look into getting you legally emancipated from your mother!!!", "NTA.  I don't get it, why wouldn't you have Your stuff wherever You choose?  The stepsister issue is irrelevant here imo.", "NTA\n\nStep sis has no consequences for ruining your things. They were informed of the situation. They forced you to share with someone who was purposely destroying your things. Your mother & her husband are the assholes. I find it funny that your grandparents said \"at least they know it's safe.\" That in itself should state what everyone knows is true. The husbands daughter is not to be trusted with your belongings.", "NTA. They should've found a better solution years ago. Taking everything to your dad's was a smart idea.", "NTA, since her taking and ruining your stuff was considered \"sharing\" to your mom.  Sounds like \"sharing\" was a one way street.  Too bad your mom didn't have your back.  Since it's been years, can you live full time with your dad?", "Real talk? Your mom is the AH. \n\nYou are absolutely NTA. You are a child. It's ridiculous that your mom would treat you like this and go as far as calling your grandparents, hoping they would back her up. I'm glad they didn't. You are absolutely entitled to your stuff and you are allowed to have boundaries. Is sharing caring? Sure it is. But your stepsis isn't sharing, she's taking. And having healthy boundaries and more important than sharing. Being selfish is not a negative trait and in this situation you should absolutely be selfish. If she's not going to respect you and your things then she should not have access to them. \n\nI'm so sorry you're in this situation. I hope your mom sees this and realizes she should be more respectful of your feelings.", "I think you recognized a problem and you solved it.\n\nYou deserve credit", "NTA - your mom is wrong here on SO many levels!", "NTA. You don't have to share your things with people who are destructive. Stepsis seemd like she intends to continuously break your stuff. I don't blame you for hiding your stuff", "NTA and I absolutely admire your chutzpah!", "NTA. When parents refuse to parent, you have to handle your issues yourself. You did that effectively. There is nothing they need to be complaining about.", "NTA. You don\u2019t trust her because she ruins things you are forced to \u201cshare \u201c with her. You don\u2019t have a good relationship with her because she ruins your things. You don\u2019t leave anything consequential at your mother\u2019s house because your step sister ruins your things and faces no consequences. What you are saying to your stepdad by your actions is that you don\u2019t trust your belongings around his daughter because she ruins stuff. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he needs to start giving her consequences for ruining your stuff.  Forced sharing has never led to anything other than resentment. If they want you to have a better relationship with your step sister they need therapy and they need to teach her to respect other people.", "NTA. Step-sister is not related to you and there is no reason that you have to have any relationship with her at all. Whatever her issue is, that is not on you and you have every right to protect your property since your mother lets her use the same room as you and does nothing to protect your things. \n\nThey can't force you to like her or for her to like you. Your step-father predictably will say HIS daughter is a lovely, wonderful child and you are the one in the wrong. Again, NOT YOUR PROBLEM.   \n\nAnd as mentioned, since things aren't that good at your mother's, talk to your dad about getting the custody arrangements changed. You are old enough that a judge is going to lean heavily on your opinion.", "definitely NTA, i\u2019d do the same in your spot", "NTA\n\n>Apparently dear old stepsis has been trying to find the goods for years but **it was when her dad said I should have a game console there**, that was given by my grandparents **and they couldn't find it**, they realized what I had done.\n\nSo, not only was stepsis going through your things without your permission, **her father was encouraging her** to...", "NTA\n\nYou have gone to them in the past and were told to share. If they want a game console in their house, I suggest they buy one.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m sorry you had to take such measures to begin with. The way I see you did what they refused to do and that was find a solution. \n\nGood on you for holding your ground.", "NTA your mom and step dad are out of line. \n\nMaybe try tell them straight up, you guys put me in a bad situation.  You don\u2019t like the step sister, you don\u2019t have too. It makes no sense to share a room with here. Why would you leave your good stuff for her to go through while you\u2019re not there. Don\u2019t feel obliged to share with her no matter what your mom says. She is being a bit manipulative here in my opinion. \n\nI\u2019d speak up to your dad about all this. Maybe he could have a chat with them both. Say it\u2019s impacting your relationship with your mom.", "NTA:  The way you type/monologue you are mature, maybe beyond your years?  You are setting good boundaries and they would not be boundaries kept if you left your stuff there.  Kudos.  This will be wisdom that goes with you as you form your own relationships and bonds.  Parents may never get it, but with time the hope is that they will grow and change as you are growing and changing.", "Your solution has worked for years and they\u2019ve never even noticed. I\u2019m also really confused on what they expected your grandparents to do. \n\nMom and stepdad need to accept your stepsis has a nasty habit of touching and breaking other peoples belongings, and that has consequences. The fact your stepdad is surprised you think this makes her a bad person tells me the apple probably didn\u2019t fall to far from the tree. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou just don't want your stuff broke or missing. Where's stepsister's stuff? Why's she need your belongings? If mom and stepdad want her to have nice things, they can buy them for her. \n\nYou're allowed to have your own belongings and a say in where they are/who uses them.", "NTA it\u2019s your stuff you can keep it wherever you want. If your parents want to rebuild trust and help you and your stepsister work on your relationship they can do it a different way that doesn\u2019t involve your stuff. \n\nMaybe they can buy something cool \u201cfor the room.\u201d You can know full well it might get destroyed and manage your attachment and expectations of the item. Or maybe your step sister will grow and earn back your trust. But that\u2019s up to her.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because she\u2019s a step sibling. It\u2019s because she\u2019s an individual who took certain actions and so you are preparing in case she takes future similar actions.\n\nI will say that \u201caround 12\u201d can be a time when some kids aren\u2019t very nice. It can be for a lot of reasons. I was personally a nightmare. But I like to think I grew, matured, and learned. You don\u2019t have to, but it might be worth it to keep trying with your stepsister. She might grow out if it in time. Just do it in a way that feels safe to you.", "Bahahaha NTA \n\n\nThis is brilliant. Good on you for effective problem solving and for standing your ground.", "NTA. You asked for help and got none, so you solved your own problem. And wow, how checked out are your mother and her husband, that they haven't looked in your room in 4 years?", "NTA\n\nShe ruined a sentimental object. Enough said. I will never understand why society forces kids to share. Adults aren\u2019t forced to share.", "NTA. You DID tell them your concerns. They told you to \"share\". She's a nightmare and needs to be put in her place and parented correctly.", "NTA.  Anyone, \"family\" or otherwise, who deliberately wrecks your stuff and says \"But I was just sharing!\" deserves to have your stuff off limits.    \n\n\nI don't know what your mom is thinking, but she should have laid down the law the first time your step sis wrecked one of your things.  It takes work to get the eyes off a stuffie.  She did that on purpose and it was mean.  Your mom was too busy hoping for a Perfect Family to set down rules and boundaries to actually make it easier for you to get along.  \n\n\nBecause your mom wouldn't protect your nice things, you came up with a great solution.  \n\n  \nMaybe someday if Step Sis **proves that she can be trusted** not to destroy your game console, then maybe she can borrow it.  But that's a big IF, given her track record!", "NTA at all. Mom didn\u2019t care when you tried to say something before, so why should you believe her now? Don\u2019t bring your stuff back\u2014sounds like step-sis will come back with a vengeance. Though, honestly, I\u2019d take literally everything just out of spite, lol. \n\nThat said, why are you the one expected to be \u201cfair\u201d and \u201ctrusting\u201d when all she\u2019s done is destroy your stuff?

I'm glad you feel secure at your dad's place. \ud83e\ude77 You made a good decision about moving your property to safety, and have no obligation to share with someone who only takes and destroys.

Not blas\u00e9 and not accepting for sure.", "Your mom is trying to pretend she would have protected your possessions, and she is absolutely lying. You did the right thing, and don't change now.

You get to decide what to do with it", "How old are you now? NTA, anyway. Too bad but that\u2019s life.", "NTA - not even a little. But you're very clever to protect your belongings. My mom's boyfriend let his kids DESTROY my bedroom,  and I was reprimanded for being upset, so I'm really glad you have a place to go, and family that supports you.", "NTA that girl is undisciplined and that reflects on her parents, you don\u2019t get to go through peoples things and take them that\u2019s literally theft!

She is way too old to be acting that way.", "NTA your mother and stepfather have failed to parent the situation before your relationship with your step was so ruined. They are more offended about what you and others think about their home and their control over their children then about the quality of the relationship between you and your steps.
