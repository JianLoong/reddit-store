I split my time 50/50 between both houses. My mom has been remarried for a number of years now and has three stepkids. Two boys who are younger and a girl the same age as me. She and I got along so badly that the custody times were switched so we were not in the house at the same time because we could not get along. It all started with her taking my favorite plush animal without permission and ruining it (the eyes were gone and it got soaked which ruined the color). When I told her she shouldn't have taken it she made it her mission to take my stuff without asking and rarely had any consequences for it because I was told to share. Some of the stuff was fine but other stuff got ruined too.\n\nWhen my mom told me that she would still sleep in the room after the change in custody when I wasn't there I knew I did not want the important stuff left at my mom's so I took it all to my dad's with me. I was 12 at the time.\n\nThis was only discovered a few weeks ago. Apparently dear old stepsis has been trying to find the goods for years but it was when her dad said I should have a game console there, that was given by my grandparents and they couldn't find it, they realized what I had done. I was confronted by my mom and her husband and I admitted it. I told them I didn't trust that girl with my stuff and moved it all to safety. My mom asked how stuff is safe when my dad has two stepsons at home. I said because they're not allowed to go through my stuff and because they're good guys who wouldn't do that. My mom's husband was like what are you saying about my daughter. I told him that he's known for years what we think of each other.\n\nMom called my grandparents and asked what they thought of the console going to my dad's. They said they were fine with it. At least it was safe.\n\nMom told me I should have told them my concerns and worked out a better solution than pretty much emptying my room. She also said surely there is stuff I am willing to share. I said not with stepsis. Mom told me I wasn't being very fair and how are we ever going to have a good sister relationship if we don't trust each other. I told mom we won't, because we're not sisters, we will never be sisters and I don't ever want to be.\n\nMy mom and her husband think I'm an AH for doing this so I gotta ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1683923109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fw0vf/aita_for_removing_the_fun_stuff_from_my_room_at/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are just trying to appease, not fix. \n\nYou don't mention ages but as you are all still under custody agreements, you're still kids. And kids grow up. Your stepsister could still change and become responsible adult. \n\nIt doesn't sound like there is anything you need to do at the moment. \n\nIf your mom and stepfather want to work on the relationship with you and the stepsister, be polite.

It sounds exhausting. Can't you stay at your dad's?", "NTA exactly\u2026. I just think you could have laid it out in better terms. Your stuff is your stuff and that should be respected. Your step sister has proven that she doesn\u2019t respect you of your personal items like your stuffie and you have every right to move it to a safe place. You can say your brothers respect your items and privacy so that\u2019s why you felt ok with leaving things there Instead. It sounds like you\u2019ve raised this concern before and mentioned there are almost no consequences, so you can tell your mom that\u2019s exactly why you did what you did.  But wether you like her or not she is your family now and should try your best to not go out of your way and drive a wedge between you. It\u2019s ok to ask your mom for space and to tell her you don\u2019t feel heard or respected and after the divorce to need some things for yourself.

The old switcheroo. \n\nYou either have a family bond with someone or you don't. No one else can choose or force that.\n\nYou're NTA.

I never told my mum about it because SS could do no wrong in her dad\u2019s eyes whereas he saw me as difficult & as a bit of a drama queen. It was infuriating & I still have some anger toward my mum for letting it happen, especially in **my** home. My things never got broken though so I cannot imagine how much worse it must be for you having to share your space when you\u2019re not there & having her break your things. Your mum needs to sort her priorities out. I\u2019m so sorry that no one on here can do anything other than validate your feelings & reassure you that you 100% did the right thing. Is living with your dad full time an option?", "NTA. It sounds like your stepsis gets away with murder, and you're just expected to go along with it.

Because it is the same principle for step siblings. Two people are forced to live with each other, without being able to consent and on top of that aren't even allowed their own feelings.

Sometimes it works out, sometimes not.\n\nEspecially given the history of animosities between you two they can be happy that you are at least civil.", "NTA.  None of your step bros seem to have an issue with boundaries.  I\u2019m sure your stepsister is going through something.  She\u2019s acting out and maybe feels competitive towards you hence continually destroying your things.  It is the adults responsibility to manage her behavior and since they didn\u2019t you took matters into your own hands.  Rightfully so.  It may be worth it to raise these issues to your trusted adults (Dad, maybe grandparents) in case your mom wants to continue harping on your about sharing.  I don\u2019t know your age or where you live but you may be of age to make a bigger choice in which parent you stay with and for how long.

I just think your mom & her dad have failed miserably by not ensuring that you each have that small zone that is entirely \"yours\" in the space you (unwillingly)share.

Many times parents don\u2019t really listen to their children and ignore what\u2019s in front of them.  Grown ups think oh children should get a long easy not realizing kids are people with their own personalities too. but ask them if they get along with just any grown up and I promise you they don\u2019t.  At this point of you getting ignored then there is not much else to say and you are doing the right things to protect your belongings. If your mom brings it up again stick to one sentence every time.

They may never get along and that is ok. I guess i mean don\u2019t act mean about it to your parents and make their attitude towards you worse, she is the victim but saying mean things won\u2019t help her situation. it sounds like her mother is not very understanding and when that\u2019s the case it\u2019s best to not make it worse. \n\nFor example my sister was incredibly awful to me as kids and I was always begging my parents to do something to stop her or defend me more. It got to the point that I started look crazy because I just keep screaming and no one is listening. Like I\u2019m the problem. My mom honestly had her own shit to worry about but that\u2019s no excuse. Anyway I did what OP did, separated my self as much as I could and Instead of voicing my concerns to my parents any longer I\u2019d just stand up for myself. Cut to now we\u2019re both in our 30s and my calls with my mom go like this, \u201cyou\u2019ll never believe what your sister did to me or said to me or tried to manipulate me into?! \u201c And I say \u201cyeah mom I totally believe it, welcome to my childhood.\u201d While it isn\u2019t a huge win it\u2019s nice for everyone to see what I\u2019ve been dealing with.

They really push that shit. Therapy can also take months to get started so it would just be easier to keep going and when I'm close enough to 18 just stop going. Would save my dad a lot of money and us a lot of time doing this stuff.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I will check it out.", "Where dis OP say mean things? She was honest about her feelings.

The therapist cannot disclose your conversations to your parents so it's a safe space", "Good luck. Don't let anyone kill your sparkle.", "Thanks. It still makes me sad because I slept with it every night and brought it between homes back then. It hasn't left my dad since it happened.", "My son is a full grown adult - but I still know where my binky and Mr Crackleface are.
