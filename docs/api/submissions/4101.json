I 29f have a 5 person household. My kids are 12, 9 and 6. Husband is 31. My sister (19) became homeless recently with her 1yo son and her dog. I'm her only option at this point. Our parents are scum and we have no family that isn't estranged. She asked if she could stay here and has admitted there's no plan for the foreseeable future. She doesn't know how long she will be here for. She's only part time working at the moment so it's difficult for her to save. I told her she could stay here and so could my nephew but the dog is not welcome in my home. \n\nI have many reasons for this. Main one being I don't like dogs. Other reasons being I have cats and my sister's dog has already attacked a cat back last year. More reasons.. well.. I just don't want it here. I have the space (yard wise). That's not the issue. I simply don't have the time, energy or patience for her animal. I'm also not going to be feeding the animal and already know that she struggles as it is. I have no problem helping feed her or my nephew but I'm not footing an extra bill for a dog. \n\nI didn't tell her all of this directly but she does know my stance on dogs and she also knows that I felt she should never have gotten the dog to begin with because she's never been what could be considered financially stable. She's had the dog 2 years. All I said was her and my nephew and stay for as long as needed but the dog couldn't. She was immediately at my throat. Questioning why I felt is was appropriate to ask her to get rid of her son's \"baby\". I told her those were my stipulations and I didn't have the energy to argue the fact, considering I'm already offering up a lot (my boys will now have to share a room just to give her and my nephew a room).

But oh, well. The dog can be surrendered to a shelter or rescue organization to be adopted out. The humans you are taking in take priority over taking on another animal.", "Listen, I am a dog lover, but this is clearly a NTA situation. It would cause undue stress on your pets already and worse case the dog attacks one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there anyone in the family that can house just the dog for now? Maybe someone that has dogs and can give it the time an attention the dog clearly needs?", "NTA - besides being your home/rules, the reality of the situation is, is that she cannot provide for the dog, herself, and her child, and she needs to prioritize. She might just have to find someone else to take the dog, even if it's temporary.", "NTA\n\n1. It is your house.\n2. Your sister is an adult.\n3. Not compatible with your pets. \n4.

Did I mention that it is YOUR house", "NTA. \n\nI love dogs, I have a dog, and I\u2019ve been volunteering at shelters for over ten years. Your sister made an incredibly irresponsible choice in getting a dog when she couldn\u2019t afford it. You\u2019re not wrong at all to have boundaries regarding her pet - especially if it\u2019s known to attack cats which you own. \n\nShe needs to get her priorities straight and make compromises. The lack of gratitude on her part for you supporting her for the foreseeable future is a little astounding. It sounds like she has a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA, and I'm a dog person. If you don't want a dog in your house, that's your prerogative. A 1 yo is not going to be upset about his dog going to live with another family. She can rehome it.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want animals that will hurt yours in your house , that is completely reasonable. If you don\u2019t want a dog that will hurt your cats on your house, that is not your fault. Also, it is very unreasonable of her, to expect you to pay for her dogs food if she moved in.", "NTA\n\nIt's a sad situation and I feel bad for the dog, but it's not your responsibility. Even if the dog didn't have a history of attacking cats, it's OK to say no to this relatively *huge* ask. As it is, you'd be irresponsible to your own household to allow the dog in.\n\nSince her son is only one, it's doubtful he'll be traumatized by having to give up his pet. If his father's parents are willing to keep him for the time being, he can visit fairly often (or maybe the three of them can stay with them; has she asked?)", "NTA\n\nShe probably lashed out on you because of her terrible situation. But unfortunately life is full of terrible situations. You offered her a place to stay for free as long as she got rid of the dog and she that doesn't work for her. She's can't complain about free housing and needs to find other alternatives that do work for her", "NTA\n\nAre pets beloved family members? Yes. Is your sister in a vulnerable situation and desperately trying to keep her family together? No doubt. Does that mean you should have to house an animal that has already attacked one of your pets and whose requirements for care and feeding will likely end up being footed by you? Absolutely not. \n\nI feel for your sister's situation but she can look into having someone foster the dog or give it to a no kill shelter.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is an adult who should be caring for herself.\n\nYour opening your home to her and her child is an act of generosity.

ESPECIALLY because he\u2019s attacked a cat before.\n\nI\u2019d avoid getting into the why\u2019s with her. Just be firm and tell her you will not home her dog, and see if she has a friend who can take it in forever or until she gets back on her feet.\n\nAlso her son is 1. His \u201cbaby\u201d?? He might be attached but he\u2019s young enough to not be THAT attached", "NTA. You have her the terms, it\u2019s up to her to accept or decline.

What is NOT her choice to make is what animals you allow in your home.", "NTA was she abused? Or in a dangerous situation? The only instance that I might call you TA is if those instances happened.\nDogs are even allowed stay in some women shelter because they are ESA and protectors against abusers so they form a very strong bond.\n\nIf not the case, N T A. She can find a shelter, find a family to take care of the dog, or find an alternate solution.\n\nP.S: I am a huge dog/cat lover. I get that saying to someone that they need to abandon a part of their family is hard. But it's your house and you also have a cat, so I get you.\n\nEdit: changed after OP answer. She is a bad dog owner on top of everything.", "NTA. The baby really isn\u2019t old enough to remember the dog long-term. She\u2019s clearly attached, which I understand completely as a dog and cat owner, but you are offering her all you can give (which I agree is all you can give). \n\nShe\u2019s going to have to think about that and make some hard choices. She doesn\u2019t have an easy option, but that\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA and I love dogs. I have 2. If she wad having trouble financially she shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place. How will she pay for food, vet bills, etc? And it's your house your rules. I would NEVER try to force my dog on another person or their family. And honestly your sister has to think if her owning a dog is the best thing for the animal or just something she wants. The dog may be better off if it was re homed even if your sister doesn't move in", "NTA, a friend of mine offered to take in her stepdaughter's dog, and it ended up killing two of their other pets. It went straight to the pound after that. Your primary responsibility is to your household. Letting her and her son stay without the dog is very reasonable.", "NTA\n\n\nIf you can't afford to keep a pet, and that means the ability to pay insurance and vet fees as well as just feeding it, you shouldn't have one. It is just irresponsible, and not in the dog's best interests.", "NTA. It's your home, and you offered a place for her and her son.", "NTA\nShe needs to prioritize her children and get rid of the 4 legged one \n\nShe needs to be an adult.", "NTA.\n\nShe can either see if any friends will help her whole family out, or be willing to temporarily take on her dog while she works on a new living situation that can include her dog.  You're not obligated to take in her dog, especially when it's attacked other animals before, of the same species of animal that you own.  \n\nI would have probably told her straight up.  \"No animal that has ever attacked a cat in the past can reside in my home where my cats live and your son's dog is not more important to me than my cats.\"", "NTA\n\nYou are doing a lot for her and her son by letting them move in and as the expression goes \"beggars can't be choosers.\"  There's already a lot of people (and pets) in the house and about to be too more... it's reasonable for you to put your foot down on the dog issue.  It's unfortunate for your sister and the dog, but she needs to be thankful that you are letting her stay at all.\n\nAlso, it's pretty uncool that she's trying to guilt trip you by saying that by not letting her have the dog your are hurting her son by \"taking away his baby.\"  If he's 1 year old, he's not really even going to be aware of what is happening with the dog, she's just trying to use him to gain sympathy.", "NTA. You are responsible for your immediate family over your teen sister", "NTA- you make your own case fairly well. I might defend myself by saying- a heartless person would not rearrange their household to make room for you. I do empathize for your situation but I am not willing to make sacrifices for a dog. If your concern was about your son's potential disappointment in regards to the dog, then you should have never taken the risk given the volatility of your circumstances. That is solely on you.  If you intend to blame me for things that you, yourself, have done, then you will find that I am heartless in refusing to accept it. Further- you will not upend my household, do not attempt to force my hand where my boundaries are concerned.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. You don't even have to list reasons. It's your home. You're taking her and her son in. That's more than enough. The dog needs to be rehomed.", "NTA. A 1 year old doesn\u2019t care about a dog and your sister can\u2019t support herself and her child - the dog should go to a different home.", "NTA.  I like dogs and that would be a hard No from me too.   \n\nShe cannot take care of herself or her son--why is she expecting you to take of them and a dog too?   Vet bills can be expensive (at the moment I have a cat recovering from cancer/chemo, another who has a heart condition, and another with a stomach issue--trust me, it can sneak up on you rapidly).  \n\nSounds a lot like a choosy beggar.  Why is she only working part time?  Is there anything you can do to help her get on her feet and help her be self-supporting?", "NTA\n\nPeople who are begging should  not make conditions,  simple as that.\n\nYou are offering her housing for her and her child.  She will need to either find a friend to host her dog for the foreseeable future, or surrender the dog at the local shelter due to inability to provide for it. \n\nShe then needs to get a job or get some training for a good job, and grow up.", "Some of the shelters have programs where they will house or find temporary fosters for the pets of those that have fallen on hard times. Even if she can't find one, has she even made an attempt to find someone else that can help or is she expecting you to just take over all her problems? I am a pet and dog lover, but I would find that a huge ask to house indefinitely, an adult, 1yo child, and pet. Yes it is difficult to let go of a pet, but she can't even take care of herself right now, she isn't doing the dog any favors. NTA", "NTA you are being super generous.  She can find a foster home for a dog somewhere close by so her son can visit him.   But she needs to focus on a safe home for her son and rebuilding her life not verbally attacking you. \n\nGive her a chance to rethink then make the offer.

Ot's YOUR HOUSE. You have PERFECTLY valid reasons and your sister is making the dumbest decision (or made) by having a dog while struggling and having a BABY.

This is a reasonable limitation to make when you are doing an incredibly challenging and difficult thing taking responsibility for your sister\u2019s family.", "NTA she should have gotten rid of the dog when she couldn\u2019t afford to support her and her son, you\u2019re being more than reasonable in exchange for saving their lives", "Your sister put herself in a situation where she is homeless and her kid is 1 years old. He won't remember anything. He WILL remember a close relationship with his cousins. \n\nSadly, your sister needs to grow up. It isn't easy,  but a must. \n\nI'm proud of you for opening your home to them - despite the consequences it'll bring to your family - and drawing a fair boundary. \n\nNTA", "NTA! It\u2019s your home, your rules, your money! She can either take it or leave it", "NTA, I love dogs, but you can't force your dog on people. If she really loves the dog she will find him temporary home and will find solution to house her family as soon as possible. It woud be different if it is task trained dog for disability, but in this case most you can offer, if you are willing to, to help her find someone to take the dog in for time being.", "NTA and hold your ground mama! The audacity! You don't even have to justify yourself. She's so irresponsible. I feel sorry for her kid.\nThe entitlement of your sister is astonishing! You don't owe her anything to begin with. She should be grateful that you are willing to take her and feed her and your nephew. Beggars can't be chosers. NTA", "Maybe you\u2019re too young to remember hurricane Katrina. But one of the reasons many people declined rescue and died was because the shelters wouldn\u2019t allow pets. Similarly, studies have shown that people in domestic violence situations are less likely to leave if they have a pet when shelters wouldn\u2019t accept.\n\nThose two things have caused policy changes. Red Cross shelters now allow pets in natural disasters. In the case of domestic violence, shelters in many communities have partnered with foster organizations, Petco, and PetSmart to provide short term pet housing.\n\nShelters and rescues are pretty full up and it costs money to surrender. But beyond the financial cost, it can have some pretty tremendous psychological impacts on children and adults to have to give up a pet when they are experiencing homelessness. \n\n\nSo. With all that said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for wanting to protect your cats. I do think it would make sense to consider options such as creating the dog when not leashed and keeping the dog separated. Or, call United way 211 and see if they can refer her to a shelter or services to keep her dog in the short term.\n\nI\u2019d also strongly suggest that you put a hard date on this. She needs another PT job or a new FT one and then she needs to GTFO. I wouldn\u2019t offer more than 3 mos. It\u2019s going to be a real strain on all of you. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA but I hope that you guys can find a temporary solution that doesn\u2019t involved surrendering the dog.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I did put that the dog is a cat attacker. Trial run is not an option.", "This is an unreasonable suggestion.  The dog would kill OP\u2019s cats, as OP explained in her original post.", "Ugh. I get what you are saying but anything OP does on a trial basis will be impossible to take back. Her sister is moving in w/o any kind of plan. OP needs to set firm boundries before she moves in or the whole thing will be a nightmare for OP's family.", "People act like this is a binary decision: take them in, or the dog gets killed by shelter.  It's like they've never heard of rehoming or fostering.  Those options are the responsibility of the dog owner, not anyone else.", "Her kid is 1, he\u2019s not gonna remember the dog. Sister tried to use that as an emotional appeal but it falls flat. \n\nTeenagers are rarely great dog owners in the best of circumstances. A teenager with a toddler, a job, and almost no support system definitely isn\u2019t the best home for a dog. OP, you\u2019re doing both your sister and her dog a favor, NTA", "I\u2019ve seen that end very badly, but this is absolutely a valid option to consider.", "That's her problem.  Not yours.", "I guess she has her answer then. She doesn't move in with you.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA\n\nBeggars can't be choosers.  Unfortunately, I guess her son and dog can be together either at his grandparents or a shelter.\n\nBTW: I love dogs.  I had one or more dogs continuously from toddler age through 17.  I never owned a dog as an adult because I wouldn't be willing/able to give it the time it deserves.  Also, my dogs growing up were all outdoor dogs; I wouldn't want an indoor dog.  So guess what?  No dog for me or my family and they're cool with that.", "That sounds like a her issue and I think what you have offered is more then generous. Beggers can be Choosers, but the choice may not be valid for long.", "She\u2019s choosing dog over shelter.", "Sounds like she should ask to move in with the grandparents so. Not your problem.", "Why can't the grandparents take them and the dog then?", "Then she can figure out her living situation. \n\nNTA", "Pretty impossible to \u2018jump right over the fact\u2019 when you never stated it to begin with.\n\n\n Attacked a cat \u2260 killed a cat. \n\n\nDogs and cats play and also attack each other. There are measures you can take to prevent this from happening. But like you said, you have your reasons.. and although you\u2019re now trying to argue that they\u2019re strongly based on concern over your own animals, I\u2019d counter that it\u2019s clear that your dislike for her pet goes beyond just concern for yours. You won\u2019t allow your children\u2019s cats to be \u2018killed by her animal\u2019 (seems like catastrophic thinking rooted in your bias against dogs) and yet, you find it perfectly saint-like of you to  expect her to get rid of her child\u2019s dog, as if her having any feelings about it is highly unreasonable. It looks to me like you\u2019re backpedaling and virtue signaling now to preserve your ego. \n\n\n My vote still stands. YTA. For all of the reasons I listed. Like it or don\u2019t, that\u2019s my vote.", "To be fair you ordered the first reason as \"you don't like dogs\" and you weren't specific that the dog killed the cat - \"attacked\" can mean a variety of things. Did you explain that reason your sis - that her bringing her dog places your cats at risk?", "You are entitled to your opinion. As you said, OP *offered* her sister and nephew a place to stay. \n\n\nWhile I agree that that is an amazing and beautiful gesture, I firmly believe that OP\u2019s delivery and insensitivity to the situation make her TA.\n\n\n OP could have given her sister the opportunity to engage in an open conversation where OP outlines their concerns while also reinstating their boundaries and stipulations, AND comforting their sister while she makes this tough decision instead of completely dismissing her and her emotions entirely and throwing her virtuous gesture in her face.. making her feel like a burden.", "I mean you can't keep them separated? I'm currently dog sitting, which I also hate by the way, and I keep her in another room and my cats get the run of the house. I know that's not ideal for a long term situation but it's better than death.", "You realize she could keep them separated right?", "Exactly, it's not binary, it's messy. Not sure where you're located but a lot of dogs don't make it out of the shelter. Most rescues don't have the space to just taken in dogs that people decide they don't want anymore, they usually taking them off the street, or getting the at last call before death. Yes its the sister responsibility but she clearly has a track record of the opposite.", "Attacked should be enough.\n\nWhen you have pets, dogs, cats, goldfish, doesn\u2019t matter, you have an obligation not to put them at risk.\n\nThe sister has a dog with a history of attacking cats. The dog can\u2019t live in a home with cats. Period\n\nEdit to add- I have 4 cats and a dog. My daughter and son-in-law are here at least 3 times a week with her dog.\n\nYes, they all play together. There is a big difference between animal rough housing and an actual attack.", "Nice reasons. Really shows how your love for dogs leaks through your biased opinions\u2026\n\nCan you explain why Op is responsible for her sisters dog though? I just wanna know where you got the idea that she should be taking care of not only the cats and her kids, but this already dangerous dog as well.", "Yes, she knows. I explained that to her through text and her only response was \"omg that was one time and hasn't happened since\".", "Who cares. It\u2019s HER HOUSE. It\u2019s already full with her husband, her kids and her own pets that she pays for in HER HOUSE. She\u2019s helping her sister and offering to support her. She doesn\u2019t even need to give a reason. No is a full sentence.", "She is a burden LMAOO! Beggars can't be chosers and OP doesn't owe her to help her. \nOpe you're not TA here. Put your foot down and don't enable irresponsability and ungrateful people in your life.", "I read a lot of \u201csuddenly Op\u2019s responsibility\u201d here.\n\nBeggars can\u2019t be choosers, and Op already gave solutions on family that could temporarily care for her dog. This is on the sister for choosing to keep the dog.", "Why should OPs cats be put at risk to give a trial run to a dog that has killed cats before?", "People have lives you know. The dog is the sister\u2019s responsibility, and if she wants he dog so bad, THE SISTER, should be responsible for it.\n\nPlus, this dog has killed cats before, making it an already dangerous dog to keep around.", "I'm already having my children share bedrooms at this point due to lack of space. How exactly do you expect me to keep the dog separated from my cats? Leave it outside all day and all night, more than likely resulting in animal control being called?", "All it takes is one lapse in concentration, one instance of slow reflexes and the result could be tragic. \n\n\"Keep them separated\" works until it doesn't; constantly having to be on edge about it is no way to live.", "She doesn't need to keep them separated. It's her home. She's doing a huge favor for her sister. The sister can rehome the dog. She can't even afford a dog like make it make sense", "So maybe ESH. \n\n\nEither way, like I said, I don\u2019t think your boundaries or conditions inherently make you TA. \n\n\nI do however believe that you could\u2019ve been a lot more sensible in the way that you presented them to your sister. Texting about something like this is counterproductive. This should be a face to face, serious, honest conversation. \n\n\nI understand you\u2019re probably frustrated and fearful of what could happen. I understand your concern for your animals, and I understand why you wish she would as well, but I also think you could also have been more understanding in this situation by empathizing with your sister -  losing a pet is not easy and anyone that had to make a decision like this likely wouldn\u2019t be ecstatic about it. This situation is seeming more like a communication flaw.", "How would I know what your house looks like? It was a suggestion. A basement? Dining room? Rope the living room off? Do whatever the fuck you like, you came on here asking for an AITA ruling. If you want the dog's potential death on your shoulders just say no it can't come. Simple as that.", "She\u2019s been understanding enough. This isn\u2019t even a requirement for Op to handle, and nor is the fact that the sister should be responsible for her own actions.", "Hmm.. sister's dogs death on my shoulders or my children's cats death on my shoulders. Hard choice.", "OP is not responsible with what happens to the dog. The same way you're not responsible for every dog killed in the shelter that you didn't take from the shelter.", "If the dog dies it\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault.  I would like to say it\u2019s the sister\u2019s fault for adopting a dog she can\u2019t take care of, but when she adopted it, she may have been in a position where she could take care of it.  Who knows?  Sometimes life just happens.  In any case, the dog is not OP\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt sounds like you would be perfectly comfortable condemning OP\u2019s cats to death.", "I\u2019m not responsible for 99% of things I encounter each day that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t try and help out when I can.", "Yes and that is why OP tries to help - her sister and nephew. OP suggested to sister that the dog could maybe go to the kids grandparents, but the sister doesn't like any option in which she is parting with the dog. The sister doesn't even try to find a solution, she just wants it her own way... The dog killed a cat last year. Nobody should be pushed to bring poorly trained dog to household with cats and children.", "Would you care to take in OP\u2019s sister, infant, and dog, in that case? I\u2019m sure OP would be more than happy to pass your contact info along.   \nNo, OP can\u2019t be bothered to keep her sister\u2019s dog in check. She\u2019s already got enough on her plate with her own family.   \n\n\nNow she has to worry about fixing the catastrophe her sister created. No way in hell. The dog goes or sister doesn\u2019t step foot in the house."]}
