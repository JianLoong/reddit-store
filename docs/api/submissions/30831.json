{"id": 30831, "submission_id": "17tl2z7", "title": "AITA for letting my child ride her pony to school", "selftext": "My (36f) child (7f) asked if she could ride her pony to school last week. For context, we have a small paddock attached to our home where we keep 2 horses, one for me and one for my child. Every morning before school my child gets all of her pony chores done before we leave and we normally walk to school which takes around 20 minutes. We live on the outskirts of a fairly populated city where it\u2019s not uncommon to see horses occasionally, but we are by no means in a rural village. \n\nI agreed to let my daughter ride her pony to school because I thought it was a harmless fun thing to do, and also it gives the pony some exercise as we had evening plans and wouldn\u2019t be riding that evening. We arrived at the school gates and of course gathered a little bit of a crowd which wasn\u2019t a problem. The pony is very good and lapped up all the pats and strokes from kids. \n\nOne girl came bounding over from the year above my daughter and started shouting at me saying she wanted to ride. I politely told her that she couldn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t have a riding hat and she would have to learn on a safer horse. She immediately started hysterically crying and pleading with her mum saying he wanted to ride. Her mum looked at me with disgust and said \u201csee this is what happens when you have no self awareness and bring a f-ing horse to a school\u201d and stormed off dragging her kid with her. I was a bit taken aback but ignored her, sent my child into school and walked the pony home. \n\nI was talking to my friend this weekend and she said I was in fact the problem and I was blatantly showing off and should have known that this would cause upset and problems. My response is I turn up to the school gates in jodhpurs and boots regularly so everyone probably knows I have horses, is that showing off too? All I wanted to do is let my daughter do something a bit silly and fun. Now I am really overthinking it though and almost feel nervous to do school drop off tomorrow\u2026. So am I the asshole for letting my daughter ride her horse to school?\n\nEDIT: I want to clear some things up. Firstly, I\u2019m based in England. Secondly, the pony never went into school grounds. There is a small patch of grass about 30 metres from the main school gate and we stood there so no child with allergies would have been subject to horse germs if they didn\u2019t deliberately come over to us. This also means that I don\u2019t feel like I should have run it by the school.  And lastly, the pony is an ex-riding school pony. It has been surrounded by kids it\u2019s whole life and used to do kids birthday parties and everything. I know animals are unpredictable but I was 99.999% sure that the pony would be fine and actually just appreciate the fuss off the tiny humans (he absolutely did) ", "created_utc": 1699798504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tl2z7/aita_for_letting_my_child_ride_her_pony_to_school/", "score": 11227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If we all lived like that, we'd never get anything done!\n\nYou did something special for your daughter, and that's what matters. Riding her pony to school is a unique and enjoyable experience for her, and it's great that you're encouraging her interests and responsibilities related to horse care. It's important for kids to have these kinds of experiences that they'll remember fondly.\n\nAs for the other parent's reaction and your mate's comments, it sounds like a classic case of tall poppy syndrome. Some people just can't help but have a whinge when they see someone else doing something different or having a bit of fun. Parents who'd rather not deal with their own kids' tantrums will find any excuse to pass the buck.\n\nIt's not showing off to engage in activities you and your daughter enjoy, especially when it's something as harmless as riding a pony to school. The fact that you show up in jodhpurs and boots already clues people in that horses are a part of your life. It's not like you rocked up with a pony out of the blue to cause a scene.\n\nKeep being yourself and doing fun stuff with your daughter. It's these sorts of experiences that build character and fond memories. Don't let a few sour grapes spoil what was a good deed and a great day for your daughter.

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong that you did it, I just think that it was a very predictable outcome that at least one kid would get scared, get upset they couldn\u2019t ride it, get in a tizzy etc and that this could trigger frustration in a parent. \n\nSo if you were not anticipating that, I would agree with no-self-awareness thing. And obviously, showing up with a whole horse is different from you showing up in jods and boots. \n\nI do think you\u2019re fine to do it, but if/when a child flips out and a parent gets annoyed, you have to roll with that as an outcome of bringing a horse around a bunch of little kids.", "Idk, seems like an unpopular opinion but I\u2019m going with ESH.

And I'm sorry, but showing off?? Sounds to me like your friend might be a little bit jealous...\nHorses are expensive pets to keep, if you were to add up the overall cost and keep for a horse, you could afford a very fancy car.

You really should\u2019ve seen this coming though, maybe prearranged it with the school so everyone would know and the parents and teachers could work in an order to the chaos a sudden pony brings to a group of young children. \n\nThe woman was rude, but I understand where she was coming from. She didn\u2019t take her daughters side and try to force you to try and let her ride- but she could\u2019ve been nicer in the way she expressed that she did not appreciate having to wrangle an 8 year old who now wanted a pony she probably couldn\u2019t afford. And as for not actually bringing it onto school grounds\u2026. That\u2019s great, but again, small children seeing a nearby pony = chaos and disorganization, even if it\u2019s not *technically* in the school yard.
