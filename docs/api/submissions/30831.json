{"id": 30831, "submission_id": "17tl2z7", "title": "AITA for letting my child ride her pony to school", "selftext": "My (36f) child (7f) asked if she could ride her pony to school last week. For context, we have a small paddock attached to our home where we keep 2 horses, one for me and one for my child. Every morning before school my child gets all of her pony chores done before we leave and we normally walk to school which takes around 20 minutes. We live on the outskirts of a fairly populated city where it\u2019s not uncommon to see horses occasionally, but we are by no means in a rural village. \n\nI agreed to let my daughter ride her pony to school because I thought it was a harmless fun thing to do, and also it gives the pony some exercise as we had evening plans and wouldn\u2019t be riding that evening. We arrived at the school gates and of course gathered a little bit of a crowd which wasn\u2019t a problem. The pony is very good and lapped up all the pats and strokes from kids. \n\nOne girl came bounding over from the year above my daughter and started shouting at me saying she wanted to ride. I politely told her that she couldn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t have a riding hat and she would have to learn on a safer horse. She immediately started hysterically crying and pleading with her mum saying he wanted to ride. Her mum looked at me with disgust and said \u201csee this is what happens when you have no self awareness and bring a f-ing horse to a school\u201d and stormed off dragging her kid with her. I was a bit taken aback but ignored her, sent my child into school and walked the pony home. \n\nI was talking to my friend this weekend and she said I was in fact the problem and I was blatantly showing off and should have known that this would cause upset and problems. My response is I turn up to the school gates in jodhpurs and boots regularly so everyone probably knows I have horses, is that showing off too? All I wanted to do is let my daughter do something a bit silly and fun. Now I am really overthinking it though and almost feel nervous to do school drop off tomorrow\u2026. So am I the asshole for letting my daughter ride her horse to school?\n\nEDIT: I want to clear some things up. Firstly, I\u2019m based in England. Secondly, the pony never went into school grounds. There is a small patch of grass about 30 metres from the main school gate and we stood there so no child with allergies would have been subject to horse germs if they didn\u2019t deliberately come over to us. This also means that I don\u2019t feel like I should have run it by the school.  And lastly, the pony is an ex-riding school pony. It has been surrounded by kids it\u2019s whole life and used to do kids birthday parties and everything. I know animals are unpredictable but I was 99.999% sure that the pony would be fine and actually just appreciate the fuss off the tiny humans (he absolutely did) ", "created_utc": 1699798504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tl2z7/aita_for_letting_my_child_ride_her_pony_to_school/", "score": 3921, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If we all lived like that, we'd never get anything done!\n\nYou did something special for your daughter, and that's what matters. Riding her pony to school is a unique and enjoyable experience for her, and it's great that you're encouraging her interests and responsibilities related to horse care. It's important for kids to have these kinds of experiences that they'll remember fondly.\n\nAs for the other parent's reaction and your mate's comments, it sounds like a classic case of tall poppy syndrome. Some people just can't help but have a whinge when they see someone else doing something different or having a bit of fun. Parents who'd rather not deal with their own kids' tantrums will find any excuse to pass the buck.\n\nIt's not showing off to engage in activities you and your daughter enjoy, especially when it's something as harmless as riding a pony to school. The fact that you show up in jodhpurs and boots already clues people in that horses are a part of your life. It's not like you rocked up with a pony out of the blue to cause a scene.\n\nKeep being yourself and doing fun stuff with your daughter.

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong that you did it, I just think that it was a very predictable outcome that at least one kid would get scared, get upset they couldn\u2019t ride it, get in a tizzy etc and that this could trigger frustration in a parent. \n\nSo if you were not anticipating that, I would agree with no-self-awareness thing. And obviously, showing up with a whole horse is different from you showing up in jods and boots. \n\nI do think you\u2019re fine to do it, but if/when a child flips out and a parent gets annoyed, you have to roll with that as an outcome of bringing a horse around a bunch of little kids.", "Idk, seems like an unpopular opinion but I\u2019m going with ESH.

And I'm sorry, but showing off?? Sounds to me like your friend might be a little bit jealous...\nHorses are expensive pets to keep, if you were to add up the overall cost and keep for a horse, you could afford a very fancy car.

She didn\u2019t take her daughters side and try to force you to try and let her ride- but she could\u2019ve been nicer in the way she expressed that she did not appreciate having to wrangle an 8 year old who now wanted a pony she probably couldn\u2019t afford. And as for not actually bringing it onto school grounds\u2026. That\u2019s great, but again, small children seeing a nearby pony = chaos and disorganization, even if it\u2019s not *technically* in the school yard.

Over 30 years ago and I still remember it fondly lol", "I went to a high school where even the kids drove fancy cars. My dad had a custom built corvette which I would always ask him to use when he had to pick me up, but instead he would pick me up in an old (1940-50) Army truck thinking it would embarrass me & it did until all the kids wanted to check it out.", "Had a dad sit in the car pickup line in his tractor-trailer rig, trailer and all.", "My dad worked for an agribusiness store over an hour away, and during certain times of the year, 16 hour days were the norm for him. But sometimes, if the job was closer to home, they\u2019d let him bring the semi loaded with the crop sprayer home, so he could just go direct to the field instead of having to go all the way to the main office first. On those days, he\u2019d take me out for breakfast- just the two of us- and take me to school in  his work truck. Those are some of my best childhood memories- made even more special because he passed away suddenly when I was 7.", "My husband teaches at a school where one of the kids' dads is a firefighter, and their station is right by the school, so one slow day he dropped him off at school in the firetruck.

Horses (and all other animals for that matter) are awesome!\n\nWe \"baby sat\" a horse for a summer when I was 5 or 6 (lived out in the country side) and it was one of the best summers of my youth. Mom claims it was a pony, but I'm pretty sure it was an Ardennias! \n\nDated a girl in high school who had a horse amd she couldn't understand why I thought everything that had anything to do with the horse was fun, even cleaning the stables. TBH I missed the horse more than her when we broke up. \n\nI wish I had the courage to just drive up to a horse riding school and say \"horses are awesome. I wanna join!\", but being a almost 40 year old slightly chubby dude might give off the wrong vibes. \ud83d\ude02", "It's hilarious!", "OMG!! My school had this. I was always vexed about those because my mom would only ever cut one in half (for me and my sister) so I never got a whole one like some other kids. Siiigh lol.\n\nIt was normal levels of envy though, I am untraumatized now.", "Hence why I went a bit overboard and mentioned everything brought to school had to be a basic model so no one ever would feel left out, lol\nBecause kids will always find a way to glam up other stuff.", "Nonetheless, it is not the responsibility of others to preemptively accommodate the *possibility* of such situations.  Entitled mom of entitled kid needs to use this as a lesson for her kid and build emotional resilience, both for herself and her kid.", "That is another thing it definitely could be.   My point is that you just don\u2019t make an assumption the kid is \u201cspoiled\u201d (whatever the f that means) based off of a single anecdote.  \n\nA lot of people are writing life stories based on a single interaction being told to them.", "I think it's amazing what the mom did and I'm raising/raised 4 children. 1 is still school aged! He knows how to conduct himself. He could settle into class fine and talk about the pony later. Sheesh it's like parents don't want happiness for children anymore. Huh", "There is no reason this would cause any sort of disruption, other than a random \u2018untrained child running up and demanding a turn\u2019.

Instead she sees something she wants and goes \u2018mine mine I get a turn\u2019. \n\n\nOp did not exhibit any clueless behavior, in fact she was clearly careful and considerate not even going onto actual school property. Therefore what the school or any patrons of said school might think does not matter, at all, period.", "I used to live in a major urban area where it was common to see horses in the street. Schools (and grocery stores and shopping malls and other such places) actually provided stalls and hitching rails for them so that when people came by horse to these places they had a place to leave their horses. **That** is common sense. \n\nYou are not demonstrating sense.

You literally just made it up?\n\n  \n\n\nAnd I'm the dumbass. Nice logic there, dipshit.", "Aww \n\nYou could probably find adult horseback riding lessons!

Lol\n\nPart way through high-school my school suddenly switched to a \"dress code\". We didn't have uniforms, but we had to wear a plain (unbranded) white or blue shirt and navy or khaki pants.\n\nThey said it was to make everyone equal. You could still tell the kids who spent more money for their \"plain\" white shirt than those of us buying them in a multi pack from Walmart or whatever.\n\nUniforms would have been preferable to me, at least they would have made the clothes equal. Shoes and accessories.... That's a whole other thing", "Lmao being able to wear home clothes is only possible here once you go to Polytechnic or University. Everywhere has a school uniform with the school logo. Easy for public to complain to the school itself if a student is seen being an ass in public lol. \nNot even allowed to dye hair, shoes must be white. Some will specify if shirt must be tucked in. \n\nThere\u2019s some ways to glam up but it\u2019s not that noticeable if you\u2019re not really looking imo.", "Yeah I fully agree.
