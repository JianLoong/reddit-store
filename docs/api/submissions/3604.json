One to avoid the impending birth, and the other as a point of this is the start of a new family.  \n\nThe fact that you are engaged, and it has been the topic of conversation is why your sister chose the date of the baby shower that she did.  She wants the attention, though this being her forth child, what ever could she need for the newest child, beyond diapers and formula?  Unless she is expecting all new items, and is using the shower as a poor attempt to get said items.  \n\nI would also like to know, how often has your sister been upstaging you?  Is if recent, or has this been going on for a long time and a pattern of where she has to be the center of attention and everyone going in on such.\n\nThe entire guilt tripping thing, do not give in, nor should you apologize to her.  Her blocking you to make it impossible for you to contact her, only would give her the ammunition to try to milk this for far more attention.\n\nHave you sent out the invitations to the wedding?

The fact that her parents didn't defend her and piled on is also very telling. \n\nOP is NTA and needs to go low contact/no contact with her family.", "So sorry for your devastating loss of your baby! Hope all is well with your family", "I feel like it's time for the great non apology \n\nI'm sorry that you think my unborn nibling's shower is more important than my life but I don't. I'm sorry that you think a shower for a four time mom with limited  advance notice is more important than plans I've already made. I'm also sorry that you showed me where I rank in your lives and I'm sorry that I'll be reducing contact with all of you.", "I mean baby showers also involve getting help with diapers, wipes, onesies that may not make it baby to baby (they get pretty worn out and stained), bottles etc", "or if there is a significant (5+ years) gap between the children.  My (half) sister and i are 9 years and different fathers apart - my mom did not have baby stuff (and her dad deserved the experiece)", "Also things wear out and expire, no hate about having a shower but you just can't expect everyone to come no matter what.", "Same sex not same gender", "Nope. It\u2019s weird unless the last one was like 10 years ago.", "I disagree. You would only maybe need some different clothes or sheets for a different gender, not all new stuff. More than one baby shower is just greed. NTA.", "My last kid was a different gender and I needed pretty much nothing. People will typically buy you an outfit when they come visit the baby or hear about their birth.", "I don't know how many bridal showers one of my cousins had, but I ended up getting invited to three of them due to the different and overlapping social groups.\n\nThree gifts, of course.", "I get that a sprinkle for a subsequent baby has become a thing\u2026 but it isn\u2019t a necessity.  \nThe fact that Lola decided to host her own shower, for a 4th child, then get all bent when the OP couldn\u2019t attend makes Lola the entitled AH, not the OP", "That's a very good point", "Lost half my childhood to my sister\u2019s first kid. Can confirm", "Right, there is a 8 year gap between my youngest sister and the one above her, there was a baby shower hosted for my mom by her friends since she had absolutely no baby items left from the rest of us", "Yes, add more passive aggressive statements! More I say!", "Didn't you know babies turn gay and autistic if they wear the wrong colors?", "Because some people want their babies to wear gendered clothing, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's entirely the parents' choice. \n\nOP still NTA.", "Really that\u2019s you opinion. My child hardly wore the same thing twice. It\u2019s personal and you shouldn\u2019t dictate others.", "Mixed gender siblings can share clothes except clothing and baby items are gendered AF.  I feel like all my friends/family know I hate pink and I did my baby\u2019s room green but still at the baby shower for my first daughter about 3/4 of the  outfits were either dresses, pink, or had gendered language like \u201cprincess\u201d on them.", "Pretty sure the sister just wants to be the center of attention, but gender neutral baby clothing is more expensive and can be hard to find so I have some amount of sympathy for that particular concern.  \n\n\n(Granted, there's no reason a baby girl can't wear baby boy clothes but a lot of it is so aggressively gendered it feels pretty weird.)", "I thought those were called something else\u2026I just googled it and they\u2019re called pampers shower, diaper party, or baby sprinkles. (The last one is weird but okay)", "aaaaaaaaaaand once more, I must clean my monitor.", "Oh I\u2019ve always just called them showers and you just have different expectations.", "I\u2019ve been to a few \u201cdiaper kegs\u201d. You being a pack of diapers and you get a cup for the keg.", "sprinkle because its smaller than a shower haha", "Oh god, I'm so sorry you're related to someone like this.... She is exactly like those people who made 'gender reveal' parties into not only a solid thing, but into something that lead to deaths and forest fires by constantly trying to one-up the last one they heard about. In the US the whole original purpose of the traditional baby shower is to make sure a new mother has things she can't afford or might not think of. Unfortunately, you always get greedy, attention addicted people that twist things that are meant to be wholesome into just another gift grab.", "Americans only have them for the fist baby - or if it\u2019s been an extended time between - like 15 years", "I had three. I didn\u2019t expect one after my first baby, especially because second was a boy and they were born around the same time of year so clothes wouldn\u2019t be an issue but I had friends who insisted on throwing me one anyway. Then someone threw me one for my first girl, but after that no one offered and I never expected one.", "If the person didn\u2019t commit so many etiquette violations in one go I would probably be less likely to side eye it. Hosting your own shower, for your fourth kid and hounding guests for RSVPing \u201cno\u201d are all things that are frowned upon and considered tacky. \n\nModern etiquette allows for sprinkles if the children aren\u2019t the same sex or if there is a significant age gap between the children. I still wouldn\u2019t prioritize a sprinkle over an event I planned earlier, but I won\u2019t tell people how to spend their time or cash.", "i think it's tacky to expect presents after your first kid. im not buying another playpen because you fucked again lol. a casual gathering is fine but tbh i think it's way More trashy to throw another shower for a differently gendered baby. it's 2022.... buy a yellow fucking onesie.", "And to have your own baby shower instead of relying on friends", "It's traditional in the circles I know to have a smaller second shower, sometimes called a \"diaper shower\" or a \"cake shower,\" where it's really more of a coffee party with less emphasis on gifts.", "Um I love this! Too bad I\u2019m pregnant and can\u2019t drink.", "My sister has 2 kids. 5f and 2m. Different dads. She wasn\u2019t originally planning on having a second shower but her bf\u2019s family wanted to celebrate because it was his first. There are good reasons and imho so long as you aren\u2019t trying to make people bend over backwards or buy the big things that you already have (cribs, car seats, etc. can be reused usually)", "There's a 20 year gap between my children so I had a baby shower for both babies. I really didn't want one for my second but my best friend insisted and it was my husband's first child and his family was excited. Everyone's situation is different. \n\nI don't really enjoy going to any baby shower but I'll usually go and make the best of it. If it were me I probably would have rescheduled my birthday plans and went to the shower. We all do have a birthday every year and your 22nd bday isn't exactly monumental.", "My family did this...it was just kind of a low-key get together where everyone chatted and there was either a half-sheet cake or cupcakes...to be honest we did buy diapers but mostly because we got to build forts with the packages.\n\n(then again, I don't think we called them showers, it was more like a \"come say hi before we disappear into a hole for a few months with a newborn\")", "Yeah I think the definition of baby shower has loosened/some people use it broadly. Some people do a party celebrating the baby\u2019s pending arrival with food and music and maybe games but don\u2019t expect gifts.", "Yeah, exactly. You don't need a bassinet and a changing table and a stroller and carry bags and toys, but everybody needs diapers and a new outfit or socks just for the new baby is nice.\n\nWith the recommendations to avoid even family guests for the first 2-3 months it's also nice to get together for awhile.\n\nAlthough thinking about it more the one I was thinking about was an actual second shower. My ex went to a shower for a friend of hers whose second or third pregnancy was... twins!", "I think with less babies being born, friends and family may be celebrating every birth more.", "That's different. You didn't plan and send out the invites."]}
