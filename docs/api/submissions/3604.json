One to avoid the impending birth, and the other as a point of this is the start of a new family.  \n\nThe fact that you are engaged, and it has been the topic of conversation is why your sister chose the date of the baby shower that she did.  She wants the attention, though this being her forth child, what ever could she need for the newest child, beyond diapers and formula?  Unless she is expecting all new items, and is using the shower as a poor attempt to get said items.  \n\nI would also like to know, how often has your sister been upstaging you?  Is if recent, or has this been going on for a long time and a pattern of where she has to be the center of attention and everyone going in on such.\n\nThe entire guilt tripping thing, do not give in, nor should you apologize to her.  Her blocking you to make it impossible for you to contact her, only would give her the ammunition to try to milk this for far more attention.\n\nHave you sent out the invitations to the wedding?  Decided on the location, venue or how you want it to be?  Have a guest list prepared?  If you have not, one may think that offending one of the people getting married would be a good way not to be invited to said event.\n\nMind you keep all of this in mind, especially as it gets closer to the time when things like the invites have to come out and do not be surprised if the sister who blocks you now unblocks and demands that she get an invite, or her children are included, or anything of that nature.

And if you have 3 kids, free diapers would probably be welcome.", "Hahahahaha! I love this comment!", "For some people it's just an excuse to get together. A party is a party. But OP is definitely NTA for politely declining to go because sister rudely scheduled it *on her younger sister's birthday*.", "Call me crazy but I think planning your shower for your first born on your siblings bday is still a major a hole move unless you've conferred with them first and they are truly 10000% happy to share the day...NTA", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with celebrating any child. Maybe say no gifts sense it is the fourth child. But regardless, who in their right minds schedules their baby shower on their siblings birthday\n\nOP is NTA", "And attention.", "This is hilarious. I remember a woman who was upset that no one offered to host a shower for her 3rd or 4th baby, because \"this baby deserves to be celebrated too!\" *The unborn baby literally does not know or care about the baby shower. Even once born, it is highly unlikely it will ask for a baby shower attendance list.*", "Same here. I got gender neutral things (*gasp*) for my first baby and used them again!", "Even if it is the same gender I think it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s not as if babies get less expensive the more you have them", "Eh I feel like you should only have another baby shower if it\u2019s been a long time since your last baby. My sister and I are 10 years apart and I was unexpected lol so my moms friends threw her a second shower for me b", "Part of a baby shower is the celebration and things do wear out. Plus it doesn\u2019t hurt to get a couple of unique clothes for this baby. That being said later baby showers aren\u2019t usually as big of a deal/gifts are smaller.", "It's clear that Lola is the favorite and it's clear Lola didn't prioritize family by not having the \"4th\" baby shower on her sister's birthday.  Clearly, she thinks her not yet born 4th kid is more important than her living sister.   OP should go NC or LC and just take this as a learning lesson that she will not get any kind of support from Lola or the parents.  NTA OP - no apology necessary.", "Ugh baby showers are so lame. I have never been to one that I\u2019ve enjoyed. \n\nOp, your sis totally did it on purpose, or she would have asked you first. NTA.", "In my family we call the \u201cbig\u201d event a shower and if it\u2019s just a party to celebrate a baby it\u2019s called a sprinkle", "Yeah, my circle of friends have done \u201csprinkles\u201d for the second baby to replenish diapers and any other items they need again.", "I agree - and honestly people in the family will usually get ao excited they'll buy you all the clothes anyway wven without a shower. Only time I think you do a baby shower when it's not your first is extenuating circumstances, like you just moved across country and left a bunch of your old stuff behind, or there's a huge gap between the last two babies and the stuff is outdated or gotten rid of.", "I only have one child (more are planned) and babyshowers are not a thing in my country, but I do understand why people have a babyshower for every kid. First off: It somehow feels wrong if the first kid gets everything brand new and the following only get hand-me-downs because they are \"just\" the second, third, fourth child and not special anymore. Especially middle children often already grt the smaller piece of the cake, don't start with it when they are still in a womb. You probably don't need a new stroller, bed or nursery, but it always nice to have something that is specifically meant for the new baby (ca 70% of my son's wardrobe are hand-me-downs, the rest is handmade or clothes I got or bought with only him in mind. They obviously have a special meaning for me).\nSecond: When there is a significant age gap between siblings it makes sense to have another baby shower. The age gap between my older siblings and me are almost 14 years, I think it's kinda obvious that I couldn't just use my siblings stuff \ud83d\ude05", "It shouldn't, but I can't tell you the amount of comments I've gotten from my boys having anything pink. I'm not just talking about clothes either. Pacifiers, bottles, bouncer, anything. I buy most things second hand or on clearance. I'm not spending 5x as much to get it in another color. If pink is the color that's available, pink is what they get. I can't even imagine if my kid's entire wardrobe had been pinks and purples, so I can understand why people wouldn't want to deal with all that.", "The kids might be spread far enough apart that they didn\u2019t keep any baby clothes/furniture. They may have thought they were done at 3 and gotten rid of all the baby stuff, then were surprised.", "Probably a regional linguistic difference because I've always known parties for pregnant women as \"baby showers\" regardless of which number baby it is. The expectation is still different for second or more pregnancies though.\n\nThe socialization for the pregnant mom is as big a focus as the gifts (if not more), so it has never made sense to me that second or more pregnancies don't get parties generally. I found out that wasn't common from Reddit/social media.", "Especially planning and inviting people to her own shower!  Tacky as heck.", "It depends on circumstances. My son and my daughter are 9 years apart. He was  a summer baby, and she was a winter baby. In those 9 years, we moved 4 times, and I'd kept only a few baby items. When my son was a newborn, he wore shorts and short-sleeved shirts because it was hot out. When my daughter was born, she needed warm clothes. How is it \"tacky af\" that my friends threw me a shower for my daughter?", "Yes,  Miss Manners would not approve.   Even in the case of different genders.   Is a baby swing and crib gendered?  And even if it was \\*gasp\\* pink, baby boy DGAF.   I'd be OK with a shower where it was a surprise baby later in life and they had no baby equipment left because their kids were all a decade or more older.   But even then I'd say it would not be a big shower.", "Hopping on because I too am curious", "And that wouldn't trump sister's birthday get together.   IMO 4th baby shower is tacky and definitely less important than your own birthday if you had plans."]}
