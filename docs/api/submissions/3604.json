What an incredible sense of entitlement. \n\nNo one should be excited to go to this greedy event.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou cancel plans for the first baby, but I'm surprised the fourth child even gets a baby shower. She should have plenty of baby supplies from the first three, so this just sounds like canvassing for free diapers.", "I\u2019m glad you got to enjoy your birthday. It would be a very iffy situation if it was her first child. But it\u2019s her fourth child, so it\u2019s not even close. You have to be right to celebrate your birthday as you wanted.\n\nNTA. Your sister and your parents are.", "NTA- You have plans, and you RSVP'd that you weren't going within the acceptable time frame. \n\nIt does seem inconsiderate that Lola did not consider your birthday when \"prioritizing family\". Even if she did forget, she has to realize people have plans and lives outside her baby shower (for a fourth too which is kind of strange, typically its a shower for the first of each gender or if there is a large age gap, maybe a smaller \"sprinkle\" for the second) and maybe cannot make it.", "NTA", "So NTA- but sometimes it's not about whether or not someone is the AH. It is possible to be right, and yet blow shit up. You chose to die on this hill with plenty of warning that your family wasn't going to take it well. So you can blow this up further, or you can diffuse it. What outcome do you want?", "NTA.\n\nShe literally has months to do a shower. Choosing that date is a power move. Implying you are selfish God having *other plans than her family* and having your parents scold you for it is her guilt tripping you and showing that you parents would choose her over you.\n\nDo not go and have a great time by your own!", "NTA\n\nFunny how she called YOU selfish when your birthday is one day a year you didn't pick and she could've chosen any day she wanted for the shower.

That's just greedy. If your sister can't see that planning something all about herself on your birthday is wrong then there is something wrong with her. Sounds to me like she's the favorite.", "NTA\n\nYou have prior plans with others which are important to you and them, though evidently not to your sister and parents. Also baby shower is nothing important other than glorified gathering with no real purpose so not going to it won\u2019t cause any suffering to the mother to be or yet to be born baby.", "NTA. I think they\u2019re all being quite ridiculous. You absolutely don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. And the nibling is going to hate you? Seriously? That means your sister, mother, et al are going to be telling the kid all his life that his mean old auntie opted to stick to her birthday plans rather than attend their shower. That\u2019s\u2026not good parenting. Are they assuming you\u2019re going to miss all the birthdays too? Craziness.", "NTA. Tough to say you don\u2019t prioritize family while she planned a baby shower, for her 4th kid btw, on your birthday. Your sister is entitled.", "NTA. Who has a baby shower for a 4th kid? Your sister sounds incredibly self-centered. Go have fun on your birthday, and don\u2019t sweat your family\u2019s unreasonableness.", "It seems like your sister doesn\u2019t prioritize family if she wasn\u2019t willing to pick a different day than one meant to celebrate you. NTA. Your family sure are though.", "NTA you had plans and she was tacky enough to throw herself a baby shower for her FOURTH child?! I was embarrassed when my mom threw one for my second kid and insisted she put \u2018no gifts\u2019 on the invitation so people would know it was just a chance to hang out and celebrate baby. Who does a shower for their fourth?!", "NTA. You already had plans.

Are you honestly telling me you couldn't have either gone out for your birthday the day before or after, or stopped by the shower in between birthday activities?\n\nEdit: Okay, based on your comment I won't say y t a, but I don't blame your sister for being hurt.", "NTA. You had already made plans. Shit happens and she\u2019s ridiculous for being upset about it.", "NTA as long as you declined tactfully.  I\u2019m surprised there was even a baby shower for the 4th.  Like why?", "NTA - You made plans LONG in advance to the notice of the shower. If it was so important that you be there, why are you finding out about the date along with all of the other guests? I assume your family had an idea that you were planning something for your birthday and you told them when you found out. Their reaction is a bit much.", "NTA\n\nWhy should you apologize for choosing to do what you want on your birthday.\n\nYou are an adult and your birthday is one day a year. She could have chosen **ANY OTHER DAY.**  There are 365 of them. But she choose your birthday and is being dismissive of your right to choose what you want to do. So are your parents.\n\nAsk them when did they forget that you are an adult who has a birthday every year on the say day and can choose to celebrate however you want.\n\nYour plans were made well in advance and if they your sister had cared at all she sould have remembered your birthday and planned for another day.\n\nYour world doesn't revolve around your sister. You have a life of your own.", "NTA; it was your birthday first. Sister\u2019s baby shower on the same day feels like a snub", "NTA\n\n>my unborn nibling will hate me if I don't.\n\nWhile, according to some research, children in the womb may react to music and voices of people they regularly hear, there is no scientific reason to believe, the little one will remember you not being at \"their\" party that was held, before they were born.", "NTA - sounds like she doesn't \"prioritize family\" either lol.", "NTA. You had made plans for your birthday and you gave enough notice to your sister. If she wanted you there THAT BADLY she could have switched the date. They are completely over reacting and are the ones creating a divide.", "NTA. She knows when your birthday is. It's her fourth baby. Typically, it would be considered really rude to have a baby shower beyond the first. (Some exceptions might be: the other kids are several years older, so no more baby stuff in the house, first child for one of the parents, etc) But it's her FOURTH. My kid doesn't know who went to their baby shower or not. Trying to guilt you that your unborn nibling will hate you is bonkers. \n\nMy kid doesn't care my mother's book club bought their pack n play or carseat.", "Imo, the only time it's okay to have a baby shower after the first kid is if it's several years between each baby and you've gotten rid of your baby things because of that. In my family baby things have gone around the family, because none of us had kids at the same time, so one sibling was just done with the baby things before the next sibling had a baby. Went on like that for years.\n\nNTA OP", "Babyshowers aren't the norm in our country, my sister planned her own babyshower. Unfortunately it directly clashed time-wise with my plans.", "Hahah like come on ignoring her sister birthday for that party? The date is set every year the argument doesn\u2019t count since a caring sister could tell the person planning even if it\u2019s not herself that the date isn\u2019t a good fit. It\u2019s just a family I would try to distance myself from. Imagine not respecting the birthday of your sister/daughter and expecting her to fit into events parents and sister think are more important than her birthday. OP is NTA!", "this right here. OP is NTA. Her sister is making a weird power move and sis and OP's family are being AHs.", "If they aren't the norm, had she had one for any of the previous babies?", "For the first, no. But she saw Americans online having them and had babyshowers for her other three."]}
