When you were specifically asked, it gave the other people on the tram the permission to put the responsibility onto you and away from them.

Im sure you wouldn\u2019t get off for someone else either. You\u2019re fine .", "Occasional wheelchair user, full time disabled person here - NAH (except society). It is up to the transport service to provide adequate space to all passengers. You were not being ableist, you were just using a service there is nothing wrong with that. I don't think she is frustrated by you really and for her its about something much bigger. \r  \n\r  \nLet me try to explain: Not all trams are wheelchair accessible so she may not have had the ability to just get the next one as easily as someone else could. Able bodied people have more options for transport in general there's no need to check if is accessible. A train for instance has to have wheelchair accessible origin and destination stations, an access ramp on the train and enough space for a wheelchair onboard. Even just walking around is easier without any difficulty navigating crowds, stairs, narrow streets, uneven pavements, poorly parked cars etc. I think it's hard to see quite how tailored the world is to the abled bodied until you are not a part of that group. If you aren't a part of that group, going outside can feel very exclusionary, the accessible route is often the long way round or more awkward and there are some places that you just cannot go. \r  \n\r  \nYou were late and got on a tram, her tram journey began with another reminder that the infrastructure of where she lives is not built for her and a person cannot be told that message time and time again and be expected to react with grace every time.\r  \n\r  \n(Sorry if that was a bit soapboxy, I just wanted to give my interpretation, you still don\u2019t have to give anyone your seat though)\r  \n\r  \nThose other passengers are way out of line though, you could have, very politely, said some thing like: \"Sorry I can't give you my seat as I'm in a rush but perhaps some of the other passengers could\" then made aggressive eye contact. People tend to be uncomfortable around disabled people and like to ignore us and hope we go away so it is not surprising that they wanted to ignore the situation and then act holier than thou when you were unable to give up your seat. But none of them were required to give up their seats either, it was wrong for them to judge you for it.", "This was my thought. OP, if any of the people thought what you did was wrong, they would have stepped up and volunteered to let her have their space. They didn't.", "Yeah I had this happen to me once, was at the front of the very full bus, sitting near but not on the seats that fold up to accommodate strollers and wheelchairs. \n\nSometimes a mom with a stroller will come on, fold up the seats to make room and then sit on the seat nearby so they can stay comfortable and also close to their child.\n\nI was on that seat (which to be clear is *not* marked as an accomodation seat, just near the ones that are) when a woman with a stroller came in and there was literally no standing room. Some people temporarily stepped off the bus so she could have the room to fold up the seat, then shuffled back in from the cold once she was settled.\n\nShe had enough standing room right beside her stroller, but she asked me if she could have my seat so she could sit down. There was no other standing room, I'd have to get off the bus to accommodate her, since neither she or I would probably feel comfortable about me looming over her baby the way she was currently. \n\nLike we could technically switch spots but then I'd be blocking the baby from the mom and it was just stupid and awkward. \nEither I'm off the bus, or I'm buffoonishly standing between the sitting mom and the baby in the stroller, or I say no. \n\nSo I said no. \n\nLots of glares at me for...making someone stand on a bus?\n\nI wish I had turned around in my seat and asked everyone why they hadn't volunteered to get off the bus. \nOne of those regrets you have later.", "So why didn't she ask them to move? Why didn't you tell her to tell them to move?", "Not if there was no place else to move to. The whole bus is full? Wait for the next bus.", "If people are using that space and there's nowhere else to go to, are they expected to get off the bus to clear room for a wheelchair?\n\nHonest question.\n\nI have been on buses where non-disabled people were sitting in the priority spaces, and the bus was entirely full, including not just people standing in the aisle, but in front of the yellow line and riding in the doorstep. You could barely close the door so the bus could leave the stop. \n\nTo allow the person in the wheelchair on would not just be making people stand who were seated in the priority seats, but probably asking 10 people to get off the bus to make room for the wheelchair. \n\nIs that what is expected?", "I was  panicking,  I didn't expect it so I didn't really think, I'm sorry I really should have told her that", "If the bus was so full that OP was asked to get off so the disabled person could get on, where would the people in the priority seats move to?", "Next time holler over the whole tram: This lady wants a space.

There was a whole bus of people who could have offered. You had an important reason you could not oblige.", "NTA here buddy. You still sound a little young so don\u2019t worry to much about what random people on public may or may not think about you. Did she target anyone else or were you targeted because you looked like you could be pressured into moving? You\u2019ll get better at dealing with these situations as you get older hopefully.", "NTA, and if people were giving you nasty looks,  why didn't one of them offer to get off the tram?", "NTA. Why did they decide you are the only person who could get off the tram? Because they also wouldn't give up a spot for her. I would give up a seat for someone but I wouldn't get off the bus when I'm running late. \n\nOne time I was sitting near the back of the bus and priority seating was full and this very elderly woman got on and the bus driver singled me out (despite being quite far back from the priority seats) and told me I had to move. A guy actually near the woman got up and was like \"uh she can just have my spot\" and the driver then said \"No. She has to give up her seat.\" Not sure what about me pissed this guy off so much but I just got off the bus. If I had been running late I wouldn't have got off even then, just would have stood.", "NTA", "Nta. Waiting shouldn\u2019t be that big of deal to her if it shouldn\u2019t for you.

Being in a wheelchair is actually irrelevant, just another person trying to catch a train.", "NTA. I doubt many people were actually glaring though. Pretty cut and dry, it's not a fast pass to kick someone off. If it's full it's full", "NTA but this feels extremely fake lol", "NTA. There was a whole bus of people who could have offered.

I don't know but it's probably because I was the first person closest to the door that she saw", "To be fair the situation was baffling so I understand", "In this situation YTA, wether it is creepy or not to glare over her baby is for her to decide and obviously she didn\u2019t mind since she asked for your place. You are saying yourself you could have made room and stayed on the bus\u2026.maybe she was still not ok from giving birth and that is why she wanted to sit. Your seat was still to closest to the baby, no one else could have offered their seat\u2026 sorry but you were just lazy to get up and now you are making excuses.", "But as you said in another comment, the disabled spot was full of people that weren\u2019t you. Even if you left the tram, the problem would remain. As a wheelchair user, I can safely tell you that you\u2019re totally NTA here. Telling you to leave the tram was an AH move on that lady\u2019s part and also a completely pointless one since it wouldn\u2019t actually mean she had room on the tram anyways! Ridiculous behaviour from both her and anyone who judged you for not moving while also not giving up their spot.", "I don\u2019t know the lay out of your vehicles. I know from our own buses here in the UK the priority seats are normally right by the door but that\u2019s not always the case with our trains.

It was fine for her to stand next to the stroller, more reasonable for her to do it than me. \n\nWhy doesn't \"lazy\" apply to her as well, if she should have my seat?", "Have some compassion and consideration for people besides yourself", "I did, I had compassion and consideration for the baby; he or she didn't need to see my ugly mug towering over them and wondering where the fuck their mom went."]}
