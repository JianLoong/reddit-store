Yeah they'll glare, but they won't put their money where their mouth is.", "If other passengers were so concerned they could have given up space to allow her to board.\nAnd quite frankly expecting people to give up their space because you want it, disabled or not, is rude - the only exception would be you occupying a disabled seating or chair area. But as you say you weren\u2019t taking up a disabled space, so I am wondering why then you were singled out to be the one to alight. \nYou were polite in your exchange, she was the one who called you names. \nNTA", "I don't mean to seem insensitive but NTA. Why the h' would you have to offer your space? Everyone's similarly affected by lateness. She could also wait for the next tram", "NTA the tram was loaded with lots of people who could have gotten off and made room. So any one glaring at you should have stepped off. What was happening with the handicapped spots that she couldn\u2019t use them?", "NTA ; it is not your responsibility to ensure there is enough space on trams.  Also; the people who you believe were glaring at you could have easily given up their own space.", "NTA. The others could've stepped up and offered a seat. You were in a rush and were unable to compromise your position", "NTA, you had every right to be on that tram, and just because this lady was a wheelchair user does not entitle her to special treatment in this scenario, she is more than capable of waiting for the next tram", "NTA. People aren't entitled to your space.", "NTA at all, not sure why you think you are", "NTA, you weren't in a wheelchair space. Which means you weren't in a space specially for her. \n\nYou both have the rights to use the tram and she could have just like you taken the next one. \n\nYour not an ableist in this situation. Some people do use their disability as a way to get what they want. That doesn't mean you have to do that, when you are both in the same right.", "Let me get this straight. She wanted you to get off the tram mid-trip so she could get on?  \n\nNTA.", "NTA, if the other passengers are glaring at you and judging you for it, why can't they just leave and offer space?\n\nPlus, you were respectfully saying no, and you had a valid point, you were running late.", "NTA - you weren't in a wheelchair space, so I don't think disability comes into the equation here. Also, it sounds like it was during peak time, so surely the wait would only be a few minutes and for those looking at you, they could've gotten off to make room.", "NTA\n\n\nIf the tram is full, you have to wait for the next one, disabled or not. Expecting someone else to get off for you is just entitlement.", "NTA. She was using her disability to try to get her way. If she wasn\u2019t in a wheelchair would you feel the same way? Probably not. She can wait her turn like everyone else. Being disabled doesn\u2019t mean you can push other people around. It\u2019s ok if her to ask, but she should have taken no for an answer. And what about all the other people on the tram? Any one of them could have offered to get off for her but didn\u2019t.", "NTA. Being in a wheelchair doesn't mean that she's entitled to any special treatment in that situation. If it was full, then she could wait for the next one instead of expecting someone else to sacrifice their time/spot for her.", "NTA\n\nHer being in a wheelchair does not entitle her to kick other people off when its inconvenient for them. Additionally there was a bunch of people present. I seriously doubt every single one was running late or had somewhere urgent to be, but nobody else offered a space. Bet you most of those people would have refused the lady as well.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t ask anyone else to get off and nobody volunteered. You had somewhere you needed to be and you were already late. Let someone else who has some spare time grab the next one", "But if you're not in the disabled spot, and the disabled spot is full of people, how would you getting off enable her to get on?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But during the entire ride I could feel and see the others passengers glare at me like I was the most horrible human being on earth. \" .. Just let it go. NONE of them left the tram for her, so they are \"JUST LIKE YOU\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo frget it, it was not a big thing. CLEAR NTA", "Nta.  This is public transportation and your time and destination is not less valuable than hers.  The only way this would make you an AH is if you were in a spot designated for wheelchairs.", "Kinda sounds like everyone ELSE in the situation was the AH. She shouldn\u2019t expect the world to bend to her needs, and everyone else should mind their own business unless they wana give up their spot.", "NTA", "NTA, if they were so sympathetic to her plight they could have offered her their space. I dont think its ableist to continue living your life and not significantly inconvenience yourself for her. If you had taken up extra space so she couldnt get on, specifically because she was in a wheel chair, then that would be ableist. Sort of sounds like shes one of the rare people who believe everyone should cater to them BECAUSE they are disabled.", "Who was in the designated spot though? And why didn\u2019t they make space? And why didn\u2019t the chauffeur intervene or decide?", "NTA, there was a tram full of other passengers that could have given up their spot.", "NTA. Anyone of them could\u2019ve gotten off but didn\u2019t pipe up to say anything in the moment. I hope the rest of your day was awesome.", "NTA. Should have reminded her that poor planning on her part, doesn't constitute an emergency on your part.", "I think it would have been a nice thing to do for her especially as you were running late. But i dont think staying on the tram makes you an AH. Also although other people may not have been asked directly, any one of them could have stepped off for her as well.\n\nNTA", "INFO were there wheelchair spaces on the tram that other people were stood in?

When it\u2019s an equal situation, like both of you grabbing the next train, there should be no expectation of courtesy. Also if the passengers had a problem with your decision they could have exited the train for the wheelchair passenger.", "NTA. Reminds me of my time taking the T2 in Lyon, France. No room for anybody, pretty much sardines in a moving can. I would have never given up my spot in a tram for anyone, even a disabled person.\n\nEdit : Also, how is one person getting off the tram making enough room for a wheelchair? You can fit like 4 people with the space a wheelchair takes.", "NTA.  It\u2019s amazing how entitled some disabled people can be.", "NTA\n\nWas there not anyone in the handicap space?", "Were you the only one who could have been the first to leave to give them space? Then yeah I'd say a pretty flacid YTA, otherwise nah no one else was gonna get off", "Well you were it the spot for disabled people. You are not disbabled. So you leave that spot if a disabled person needs it. Easy to understand right?\n\nYTA here. Small one, but still.", "Bad luck I guess, I'm always unlucky", "I mean I was always taught to give up my space for disabled people.", "They were full of people", "Because I was always taught to make space for disabled people in public transportations and because of how the looks from the others passagers almost made me cry.", "I guess  she thought that if I left she'd have enough space to at least be in the tram", "The chauffeur probably didn't care", "Yes there were, yes they could've , no they didn't, they were looking away from the situation.", "I was standing", "I don't know, maybe they were going to ask another person after me", "There were people", "You didn't read properly.  I said I wasn't in the handicap spot", "She clearly said she wasn\u2019t in an handicap spot. For curiosity what if she was handicap? Should she move because another person asked nicely?", "Learn to read. Small skill, but still.", "I agree with giving up your chair in public transportation. But leaving the tram ? Sounds a bit extreme. People offer their chair because they can handle standing up more easily than disabled people. But I don't think that applies to lateness.", "That\u2019s who should have moved. Anyone able bodied taking up a handicap spot", "And which of those passengers was getting out to give her space to get on?", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. It would have made me feel bad too. But you did nothing wrong. You are not an asshole. You were just singled out - probably because you are young and (just judging by the fact that you had a sensitive reaction to this) maybe because you could be giving off that kind of vibe as the most likely person to be successfully pressured into giving up your spot. When you were specifically asked, it gave the other people on the tram the permission to put the responsibility onto you and away from them. It allowed them all to act like you should have done something so that they could ignore the fact that they also could have done something and did not. You were scapegoated. Don\u2019t let that gaslight you into thinking you are a bad person. You\u2019re clearly a good person judging by the way you\u2019re feeling about this now", "NTA\n\nanyone of them could have given up the space, but they didn\u2019t. They have zero right to judge.", "So was I if I was in their space but you were not", "You make space for someone in a wheelchair to take a spot on the tram WITH you, the idea of getting off the tram so they could take your spot is ridiculous and their comment about YOU being ableist for treating her the same as any other person is kinda hilarious. They're the one thinking they deserve special treatment...", "And the other questions?", "Well then tbh NTA because anyone else could have got off and made space. Why was it you that had to? Also tbh it probably would've taken more than one person getting off anyway to make space for a wheelchair. It sucks for the wheelchair user but it's no more your problem than anyone else's", "Oh weird that the people standing in the handicapped spot didn't move", "They had no disability that I could see but not all disabilities are visible", "More to the point, the driver should have been the one to instruct the people in the wheelchair spot to move. Depending on the rules governing wheelchair spaces, the rule can be that for the wheelchair spot, a wheelchair takes priority, full stop. If it\u2019s already occupied by a wheelchair, you\u2019re out of luck but if it\u2019s occupied by a stroller or standing passengers, they have to move.", "No one", "There were people in the spots, idk if they were disabled since there's a lot of disability that aren't visible. And no nobody did it", "Yes absolutely agree with you. Not all disabilities are visible. So if the handicapped spots were full of handicapped people and the rest was packed, then that lady was out of luck and needed to wait for the next one. Don\u2019t feel bad. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.", "Oh? So you have seated combo spaces for wheelchair and eldery/disabled?\n\nOur trams have wheelchair spaces AND seats for disabled. While wheelchair are clear to be cleared when someone enters with a wheelchair\u2026the other ones are usually only freed when someone asks for em.", "We have that as well but it was so full of people", "So the people who wouldn\u2019t free the wheelchair space are TA. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty, though next time I would try to direct the discussion where it belongs. Like why them suckers didn\u2019t free the wheelchair space voluntarily?!"]}
