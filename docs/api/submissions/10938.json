You are absolutely acting in the best interest of your son. Fred has no integrity which he clearly showed by cheating with your sister. He\u2019s not someone you want near you son because you are right, he won\u2019t last.", "You are NTA. You can\u2019t stop your sister from dating this guy, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to say that you don\u2019t want new romantic partners around your child until a relationship seems like it has some legs.", "So far, all of the comments that I've read are about the possibility that this relationship will not last either, and the son will once again be devastated when someone he cares for is no longer a part of his life.\n\nI think you also need to consider that the chances of a child being abused increases markedly with the presence of an unrelated adult in the home. \n\nI can't cite you statistics, because most of it has to do with young children and the unrelated partner of a single parent. Simply put, there aren't enough statistics on an unrelated adult at a sibling caregiver's home. \n\nBut this type of behavior, where a romantic partner moves in with someone very quickly and is strongly indicative of abuser grooming. And a controlling and abusive partner often tries to force a closer connection like this, because they really want to get to the part of the relationship where their partner has a physical or emotional or financial connection to them, and they can drop the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nIf you didn't have another sister to take over care, I would, at the minimum, insist on a background check of the guy.", "NTA you are the parent, you set the boundaries. Amd you have a reasonable one. You just don't wanna see your kid get attached then hurt again.", "Don\u2019t let strange adults around your son. The end.", "NTA It is wise to care for the emotional safety of your child and keep him from getting hurt especially since your sister doesn\u2019t have the best track record. Plus all you said was that you wanted to wait and see not cut Fred off completely", "Nta. You are being an appropriately protective mom. Especially as a single mom to a 12 yo boy who obviously really valued his relationship with Alex and is naturally likely really watching for people who can model what being a man looks like and creating his own identity apart being a dearly loved son and nephew and kid. I think you\u2019d be a fool not to do what you are doing.", "NTA - It\u2019s solely your decision who you are comfortable with being near your child. You don\u2019t need to justify it or otherwise explain it.", "NTA. You get to decide who you're comfortable having your child around.", "NTA.\n\nAs a parent, you must put your child\u2019s needs first and do what is best for them. Felix\u2019s age is a crucial time for development and should be taken seriously. He does not understand why someone disappears, and should not have to go through it again... Better off preventing the situation from happening.", "NTA. Your child, your choice who they see.", "NTA\n\nBackground information aside, I always thought it was standard in many families to wait a predetermined amount of time (example 6 months) before introducing the child to the new partners, even if it a partner of one of the parents. \n\nSometimes its an amount of time, when the relationship is serious, etc.", "NTA. Your sister should be supportive of your request since your son's feelings of loss are really her fault anyway. Plus, I'd be questioning having my son hanging around a potential male role model who was a willing participant in infidelity (unless OP clarifies that Fred was unaware of Diana's relationship with Alex when they had their initial fling).", "NTA. Your son is your priority and you need to look out for him and his needs.", "NTA", "NTA the simple fact you barely know him is enough. Should have left out the bit about not wanting to go through it again type thing", "NTA for all the reason you mentioned including safety. She is moving in with a man you barely know. I wouldn't be comfortable with my son having to sleep over at my sister house when there is someone living there that I don't know or trust.", "NTA. It\u2019s not just about attachments either. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave my son with someone I didn\u2019t or barely know there. You never have to apologize for being cautious with your kids.", "NTA and a good parent.  If Diana can't attend her nephew's birthday party solo (at any point in any relationship), she has some significant issues.  \n\nKudos for arranging alternate care for your son.\n\nIt's not very nice, but some people do seem to use cheating as a way to end relationships.  That does not mean OP has to hold this up to her son as admirable or acceptable.  Even if OP's parents don't see it that way.", "NTA. That's YOUR child, you don't have to bring anyone into his life until you see fit, period. But, at the same time, it sounds like you resent your sister for what she did to Alex, which caused him to no longer be in your son's life. May want to examine that before it does indeed turn you to AH behavior in the future.", "NTA. You should explain to her how Felix felt after Alex was removed from his life and you don't want to see him get hurt again by someone who may not be around in 6 months. Even if you let him start seeing him 6 months in, I would limit contact. It's not always the case but most cheaters I know, cheat again so this guy may not be her last guy and you're protecting your son who will always come first.", "Definitely NTA:  others have said exactly why.", "NTA for not wanting her to babysit him. It's understandable that you don't want your son to get hurt if and when these men disappear from his life. Six months is a reasonable timeline to show that your sister is serious about Fred. \n\nThat said, I think not allowing him at the birthday party is taking it a little far. He's likely not going to get attached to Fred at one birthday party. Regardless, it's your/your son's party and you can invite who you'd like.", "NTA for not wanting your kid around an adult you don\u2019t know. I probably wouldn\u2019t have mentioned to sister about her man not being around long. That just caused her to be defensive. It probably would\u2019ve been better to frame it like you understand that sis is navigating a new relationship and you feel it\u2019s best for all parties to have ample time to adjust without having a kid in the mix for the time being. If sis was to claim that it\u2019s totally fine to keep things the way it is, then you\u2019d have more standing to be a bit more direct in your reasoning. But at the end of the day, no one has the right to tell you who your child should be around.", "NTA, this reminds me of my sister telling me that my nephews weren't going to spend a lot of time with anyone I dated, or call them \"aunt\", until we were married. Considering how many various \"aunties\" we had as kids, due to our aunt going through a lot of breakups, I understood. \n\nThis is a man you don't know; you're looking out for your kid's safety and emotional wellbeing.", "Just gonna point out that her cheating on her bf is completely irrelevant to this story. Stick to the facts. You don't want your kid around Fred because Diana has only been dating him for 2 months.\n\nNTA", "NTA for your choice of babysitters. But YTA for not letting your sister bring a plus one to your son\u2019s birthday party.\n\nBesides, she\u2019ll probably wind up cheating on Fred too.

Good for you for looking out for your son.", "nta. you and only you get to decide who you let around your children until they become old enough to make that decision themself", "NTA, your sister she wholeheartedly agree.", "A soft YTA. I see your concerns but is it better for your son to have these relationships, then not to have them at all. Even if it does not work out in the long run, the experience for your son will be better than not having anything at all. And yes there may be a loss if he leaves, but your son will bounce back and he learns that part of life is dealing with losses. If your sister cheated once, the chance sthat she will do it again are higher. But using 6 months is arbitrary. IMHO you should let him come to the birthday party and let Diana watch him when needed. Of course if the guy is a jerk and does not engage with your son then she should come by herself to watch him.", "Extremely soft YTA.

It would take some serious time to prove one's moral standing with me given that track record, and I think OP is being generous and light on him with the 6 month rule.", "Lol that's simply not true, having people keep showing up in his life and leaving will definitely give him attachment issues.", "Yeah it's not that he's immoral for cheating, it's that the relationship isn't likely to last given how it started.", "If that's the case, Diane shouldn't be allowed to see the kid either since she was the other half of that infidelity.  Personally, I am on board with OP not letting a stranger hang out with their kid period.. I couldn't care less if they're the \"cheater\" or not...

Probably not.", "I try to look at is as the cup being half full instead of half empty. And the tweens are used to loss, they change teachers every year and friends come and go,", "I recommend that instead of looking at life through the rose colored glasses of self-help book aphorisms you look at the actual child development research about what losing a long-term caregiver does to a kid, because that's what already happened once, and that's what OP is trying to guard against.", "why dont you give me some references to read.
