NTA.", "NTA", "NTA, but I\u2019d also rethink whether a six month timeline is the only boundary you want to set for Diana\u2019s boyfriends. Technically, if the breakup between Alex and Diana happened six months ago due to cheating, then Fred has already been in Diana\u2019s life for more than six months even if they\u2019ve only \u201cbeen dating\u201d for two. Saying \u201cI\u2019d like to get to know whoever you\u2019re dating before he interacts with my son\u201d gives you more subjective power to veto and avoids future conflict if the six month date rolls around and you still aren\u2019t comfortable. Six months works as a good rule when you\u2019re talking about people you, yourself, are dating because that\u2019s enough time for you to get to know someone and know if you are serious about them but setting a timeline for Diana\u2019s boyfriends isn\u2019t really going to make sense in the future. She could, in theory, date someone for six months long-distance that you\u2019ve never met and she\u2019s barely interacted with, or date someone she only sees 1-2x per month due to a busy work schedule, etc. She\u2019s also young enough that it\u2019s a little on you for letting your son get close to Alex. She was 22 when she started dating Alex, statistically that relationship was always more likely to end then not. It also may make sense to consider how boyfriends are introduced to your son and how those relationships are explained to him. Six months isn\u2019t going to equate to the boyfriend being a permeant fixture. The fact that she has been involved with Fred for at least six months and that she is moving quickly should tell you that if there is a next one, it\u2019s entirely possible that six months won\u2019t actually be enough time to vet that person. Saying that you want to interact with someone a couple times before she brings them around, that you want to get to know them and feel comfortable around them, and that you don\u2019t want them introduced to your son as though they are family and will be in his life forever at first makes sense. There are two issues here, whether the person is safe to be around your child and whether the person is someone you want your child getting attached to/ whether she is committed to that person and vice versa. You can still all set boundaries to prevent attachment once you\u2019ve established the partner as safe to be introduced as a friend. But if you give a timeline like six months you invite future conflict with her and your parents if and when the timeline rolls around and you still aren\u2019t comfortable or if you have other boundaries you want to set after the six months (like whether a boyfriend is left alone with your child, allowed to drive your child somewhere, etc.). Now, because you\u2019ve said six months, if you\u2019re still uncomfortable at six months and say so (reasonable), it will seem arbitrary and confusing to them enough that they\u2019ll be justified in feeling like you\u2019re being unclear and a bit disingenuous with your own boundaries. It\u2019s going to be much easier to manage this in the future if you give yourself some wiggle room. Otherwise you should fully expect her to expect that he\u2019ll be included in four more months, regardless of whether the two of you have any contact prior to that at all and regardless of how that contact has gone.\n\nI'd suggest breaking things down a little into two categories: 1) what you need to see to feel safe having your child around her boyfriend and 2) what you need to see to feel safe allowing your child to seriously bond with that boyfriend. These are two different things and if you try to conflate the two into one deadline of six months it's going to create more problems.", "Yeah, I have no idea what the stats are because this situation is not a very common one. How many preteens routinely spend one overnight a week with a relative and an unrelated adult? \n\nIf I were looking for a poorly supervised child upon which to commit SA, I think I would prefer a partner who has seven day access to my target as opposed to one who only sees the child once a week. My understanding also is that one of the reasons SA becomes a routine thing is because the parent is financially dependent upon or psychologically enmeshed with the abuser, which doesn't seem like it would exist in this situation. The child might be hesitant to report because of embarrassment, but all they have to do to escape the situation is tell the parent. This situation seems very high risk for low reward, but I'm looking at the situation logically rather than from the mind of somebody obsessed with SAing a child.\n\nAnd now I'm off to r/Eyebleach.", "That\u2019s not a defense.
