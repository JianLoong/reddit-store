You absolutely had every right to kick her out for what she said. Don't question yourself about this. If your friends say you where too harsh, give them her number so they can let her move in with them for free.", "NTA that\u2019s super weird. It\u2019s your place. She has no right. If she doesn\u2019t like it so much, don\u2019t live with you. Also, I don\u2019t think that you should leave her things out in the hallway. They could be stolen. Otherwise, I\u2019d say you\u2019re in the right here. That\u2019s without actually seen your art or anything, because I don\u2019t know what kind of content is actually in it. I\u2019m assuming that it\u2019s just art from the Caribbean featuring people of color.", "NTA. She fucked around.

I worked at a company that was approached by a local university to provide free of charge training for students. We happily agreed and worked with the university to make it a great experience for the students. Everyone was excited when the students arrived and spent all morning showing them around, feeding them, going over safety rules, and getting acquainted. On the first day, over lunch, one student posted on FB how \"hanging out with a bunch of assholes at (name of company) was such a waste of time\".\n\nThe program was cancelled one hour later.", "NTA. You were slandered on social media. You don't have to live with someone who does that to you, even if you have to break an agreement. Not family, not friends, not friends of friends. Nobody gets to slander you and then go about their business like nothing happened. Anybody telling you that you were too harsh also doesn't have to live with this person or make any decision at all.", "NTA. Zero tolerance for defamation on social media.", "NTA\n\nyou did the right thing and probably avoid a lot of problems\n\nhave a nice day", "NTA.  I applaud you.", "NTA. If I were you, I would try to have the conversation with her, that she was not willing to have with you. Explain how her jumping to conclusions is what caused this. Not saying you should change your mind about her not living with you, but it might be a learning opportunity for her.", "ESH, your response was very childish, if you gonna throw her out(which is totally fine) do it to her face", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The person had already slandered her on social media without even speaking to her. And she did it within hours of being welcomed into the house. I think that this is a fair turnaround for the damage to someone's reputation. \n\nBear in mind that people already knew the slander was about OP.

Part of the morning was spent on confidentiality and if someone was stupid enough to post that on social media then what would they talk about.
