I thought it was a great solution although painful when it came to paying.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the concert was postponed for ages and I was able to save up for the trip.

Cut her off and demand the money she owes you.  DO NOT give that girl another cent.", "NTA. Let\u2019s break this down - you have lent your friend money, which they have not repaid. \n\nSeperately, you have saved your money up to enjoy something. That\u2019s fine. Does your friend never spend money on any hobbies, interests, etc? Go enjoy it, you\u2019re not remotely close to doing anything bad.", "Confused why she thinks she entitled to YOUR money. You don\u2019t owe her a thing. She literally owes you. You work hard and you have every right to enjoy yourself and treat yourself. She\u2019s not a friend. Seriously. You don\u2019t owe someone that much and get an attitude theh wont give you more. She\u2019s needs to go.", "NTA - you've already lent her a lot of money, she  hasn't paid you back and is now criticizing the way you spend your money? Money that you saved??? That's some audacity she has.", "NTA. Why does she feel entitled to your money when  she owes you alot already? Enjoy your trip, go LC with your friend.", "NTA- in what world would you be? She is already delinquent in paying back what she owes you. And your money is in no way hers to spend. The nerve!", "You should have attacked her too: so you owe me money but you are planning to go to London next year??? How dare you!!!\nObviously, she has just found a way to never give your money back...\nNTA", "NTA - your money, your choice.\nHell, you could've set the money on fire and you still wouldn't be the asshole.\n\nSpending the night at a hotel close-by is something I do too when going out.", "So how are you the AH in this Situation? It\u2019s your money, she owes you, she should have better finances. It\u2019s not like she is your family member or wife or something that you could help without something in return. NTA", "NTA. You've already helped her out but she sees you as some sort of cash machine that she's entitled to draw money from. A real friend would be happy that you're doing something you really want to do and that you'll be safe  Enjoy yourself at the concert and think carefully about what you tell her in future.\nEdit: she damaged her phone on a night out as well!", "NTA- you don\u2019t need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

It's not and she isn't entitled to any of it.\n\nGood luck getting any of the money you loaned her back. Don't throw good money after bad.", "NTA I know being a single parent is hard, but you\u2019re not her parents nor her kid\u2019s parent, so it\u2019s 100% not on you to provide for her. Not to mention she doesn\u2019t need a whole new phone because she cracked hers while she was (presumably) spending money she could\u2019ve been giving YOU on a night out. Poor planning on her part doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on your part. Spend your money how you want.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve already given your friend money, you saved to stay in the hotel, and you deserve it.\n\nAnd even if none of that were true, you still wouldn\u2019t be the AH, because you are under no obligation to \u2018lend\u2019 (cough give cough) your friend money.\n\nPerhaps one of the people she complains to about you can lend her money while you find a better friend.\n\nAnd the fact that she wants the money not for rent or groceries but to replace a phone SHE dropped and cracked is the hypocritical icing on the entitlement cake.\n\nEnjoy the concert!", "NTA. Funny how you were a great friend when you loaned her 2K. Now when you spend your money on yourself instead of loaning her more money you'll never see again you are suddenly a sh###y friend. I think she has you confused with a ATM.", "NTA. This person doesn't really sound like she's your friend, it sounds like you're her ATM. Like if she's really so hard up for cash maybe she should spend the night in? Or pick up an extra shift that you and be dropping your phone on nights out", "You need to set a deadline for the money she owes you in writing.  You\u2019ve turned off the tap and you are no use to her anymore", "NTA. She owes you an insane amount of money and hasn\u2019t paid any of it back. Why would you lend her more?", "NTA, your friend is though. She already owes you money and she needed more for a new phone because she broke it on a night out.... screw her and don't lend her any more money she's just using you.", "Nta, the fact that someone who owes you \u00a32000 has the nerve to suggest you can't spend money on yourself is the height of entitlement. Not only is this person selfish, but they obviously don't care about you/your feelings. You need to cut her out of your life immediately.", "NTA. Money saved for a purpose isn't money that's free to just use. You were saving for something. Even if it was just random savings with no purpose, you don't owe her anything, Whether she already owes you money or not. It sucks as a parent when you're really struggling financially but that doesn't mean it's on you to bail her out. That's on her. If she owes you 2k already then it sounds like she's been struggling for a while and expects everyone else to bail her out instead of finding ways to make healthy changes for her and her family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s going to London next year!!! How dare you spend your money on yourself!!!!", "NTA, she already owes you \u00a32k;  Her struggling does not make you a bad friend.

They're an unapologetic moocher. \n\nPrioritising your own needs and comfort is never a crime. \n\nEspecially when said 'friend' is miffed because they damaged their own phone while on a night out. They created their own unfortunate situation. Completely their own fault.\n\nWishing you a fantastic time in London. It is a really fun and laid back city. Explore!\n\nI will say that a map, including a map of the Underground is really handy. And if you're unused to the Underground, plan your journey, so you know which stations you might need to change lines at, etc. The staff are helpful. So if in doubt, just ask!\n\nIf you've any worries or questions, the front desk people at your hotel will be a mine of information, and will very much want you to enjoy your stay!\n\nTry not to see yourself as by yourself but as an explorer. A walk along the South Bank is safe, and you'll see a great many sights. And, if you have the time, check out the V&A or Natural museums. Or the art galleries. There's a ton of free stuff just waiting to be explored!", "NTA, she needs to get off her ass and make her own money. She is not your responsibility and the only shitty friend here is her.

Months? Years? Any real friend would be happy for you!", "NTA you are not her bank account. How dare she - who you have been kind enough to loan money - demand you spend nothing on yourself and give her more. You are entitled to not give her your money. You are entitled to treat yourself.

But you don;t need to throw more after this disrespectful woman.", "NTA you owe her nothing. And don't feel guilty for not giving her not loaning her anymore. She owes you enough.

I'm not sure you need to worry about what her other \"friends\" think of you. She probably owes them money too, or they didn't donate to her \"cause\" in the first place.", "NTA - maybe you should tell people what a shitty friend she is", "NTA.\n\nYou saved.\nShe is not owed your money. In fact, she owes you. She's a freeloader. Don't bother with her anymore. \n\nEnjoy your trip to the concert.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for your friend\u2019s bills.
