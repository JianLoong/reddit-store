Listen to yourself for a second: you're outright saying \"I can't believe that my aunt won't set aside her feelings about her dead husband on the ***anniversary of his death*** to have fun at my wedding.\" It takes a lot of gall to try to make someone else's expression of grief about you.  \n\n\nIt doesn't matter that it's been 20+ years or that she's remarried or has a great new life with a daughter; those emotions can hang around forever, especially on major anniversary dates (and triply so on the date of someone's death).

Depending on if your cousin D is the child of your deceased uncle or the new husband, it may be too much for her as well and not just her supporting her mom (which itself is an acceptable excuse).  I still can't watch father/daughter dances at weddings and excuse myself to step outside every time even though it's been years...  I can't come to the terms that I never had that opportunity.

And in the 25 years without him, my grandmother spent every single day of her life eagerly awaiting death. She had a DNR, she was almost *joyful* anytime she was sick enough to be hospitalized, and would regularly decline to RSVP to events more than a month or so in the future because \u201chopefully I\u2019ll be dead by then\u201d. I firmly believe the only reason she didn\u2019t choose to end her life was because she was deeply religious and believed she would not go to heaven, where she was anticipating spending eternity with my grandfather. She was a deeply depressed and unhappy person every day after his death. And from what I know of my grandfather, that would have made him absolutely MISERABLE. \n\nWhen my own father passed when I was in my 20s, my mother was **traumatized** - as in, she watched him die next to her and tried to resuscitate him for 11 minutes while waiting for an ambulance. They had been together since they were kids, and there are no words to describe how unbelievably loud the sound of her heart shattering was. But in time, she became adamant that she wouldn\u2019t spend every day waiting for death like her own mother did, because she knew that was no way to live - and not at all what my father would want for her. So even when it\u2019s painful to witness moments she wishes my father were there to see, or to attend events she wishes my father were attending with her, or when she is faced with someone else\u2019s milestone moments that bring her back to her own milestones with him, she puts one foot in front of the other and keeps moving forward. \n\nThe first few \u201canniversaries\u201d of my father\u2019s death were so painful for my family and me.

I would likely decline an acquaintances wedding if it was on the anniversary as I like to spend it with my mom and sibling. But if it were a family member that I was close with, I wouldn\u2019t debate not attending - because I\u2019m not going to turn down opportunities to make meaningful memories with the people I love in favor of the memories of someone I\u2019ve lost.", "YTA\n\nShe is coming to the wedding, then declining your invite to the reception.

You will be too busy greeting people, taking pictures, doing all KINDS of stuff that when asked later, you simply will not be able to recall too many particulars of who was where and when.\n\nThis was my experience and has been the experience of every bride I've ever talked to except those who intentionally had very small weddings.\n\nSo - apologize to your aunt and cousin and reframe your perspective - it'll do you a lot of good.", "When there was a story like this about OP the bride losing a mother, and her sister asking her not to put her wedding on the death anniversary, when it had only been a couple years, (maybe only one year) everyone was saying NTA. Reddit is a wild place.", "YTA - It can be 50+ years and people can still be sad on the death anniversary of someone they loved. Your aunt gave a valid reason for not coming to the reception. She's compromising by coming to your wedding. You were ungracious and cruel to speak to her as you did.", "YTA\n\nSomeone else\u2019s grief journey is not yours to dictate. She\u2019s being kind by offering to split the day with you, so be grateful for that.", "YTA for pushing once you were told why\n\nYTA for saying M is trying to guilt D into not attending\n\nD is probably not attending because you hurt her mum and refuse to apologise or even acknowledge that you did.\n\nSorry is a word you need to learn to use.", "YTA. Just because this is going to be one of your best days and milestones does not mean it is everyone else\u2019s. She\u2019s still making an effort to come to your ceremony. I\u2019d imagine this has been your main priority, however no one else matters (or cares) as much as you and your spouse. \n\nYou are asking her to attend a wedding on the day her spouse died. Weddings usually bring up memories for people, including memories of their own weddings. How dare you ask her to relive her most painful moments and to ignore them for your sake. She could\u2019ve just fully said no to attending, but now you\u2019re also causing drama over the pain she feels and will go through for YOU. she\u2019s willing to go through those memories and pain for YOU. And you can\u2019t even give her the grace to mourn in peace. The more I think about this, the angrier I get for her. \n\nYou need to humble yourself a bit and pray you never experience what she has.", "YTA. While your wedding is very important to you, it\u2019s not to everyone else. And please don\u2019t ever tell anyone how to grieve the loss of a spouse until you\u2019ve experienced it yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s moved on and it\u2019s been 20yrs! It\u2019s a day she sets aside yearly to grieve and mourn her deceased husband. You sound selfish. they both could of choose to spend that day mourning and grieving him together, but they are at least coming to see you get married. It\u2019s an invitation to your wedding not an obligation Please apologize to them both for you comments as well, they were complaining out of line!!", "Her aunt was widowed before she married again", "People will be divorced by death.", "I've noticed a trend of referring to deceased spouses as \"exes\" lately, and I think it's so rude. The person *died*; this wasn't a divorce or something like that. They'd presumably still be together if things hadn't gone tragically. \n\nOP, the correct way to speak of someone's deceased husband is \"husband\", \"late husband\", or \"first husband\". \"Ex\" is reserved for situations where the relationship ended for reasons other than death.", "Agreed. My uncle died 8 years ago and his widow still morns on his \"death day\" as she calls it. She goes to his gravesite and is in general sad. She will come to see my mom (this was her brother) and they will reminisce about him and his life. She will post pics of him on social media. She has a new husband and still does this. OP can't dictate how people mourn and the way she worded her reasoning as to why they should still try to celebrate her wedding was super insensitive.", "I do get I might've been hurtful with what I said. I just think she's making a bit of a drama you know? I'm not saying it wasn't tragic and painful for her, it surely was. But the reality is she was only 20 when she married him, and they were married for just 3 years. I don't think a lot of people would spend 20+ years thinking of a relationship from their late teens/early 20s, to the point they won't attend their niece's reception. It's her choice at the end of the day though (and I was also surprised my cousin said no to the reception as well)", "Aunt said she would still come to the ceremony but doesn't want to stay and party at the reception. How is that her \"holding a date hostage\"?", "The aunt isn\u2019t holding the whole family hostage. She said she would show up for the wedding and not stay for the reception. Just because she remarried doesn\u2019t mean that day doesn\u2019t hold sorrow or grief for her. She\u2019s not asking the rest of the family for anything.", "Where is the aunt holding the date hostage? As far as I can see, she's just declining to attend the reception, not asking anybody else to do anything or accommodate her?", "I didn't know the exact date. And M said she takes some time out to pay her respects.", "Also, I\u2019m a bit surprised that OP didn\u2019t know her wedding day is the anniversary of her aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s death. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s an important date to the aunt and cousin, so she must have heard about it over the years", "Prolly because of the upload time. Earth and it's populace are a wild bunch.", "This is such a great thing to bring up. I can\u2019t imagine being at that ceremony, the anniversary of your husband\u2019s death and probably thinking back to your own wedding, maybe even thinking that your husband never got to see his niece be married, that he won\u2019t see his daughter be married etc\n\nBut hey it\u2019s OP\u2019s special day, it\u2019s all about her. Who cares how much you hurt family if it means you have your perfect day /s", "I have heard another widow/widower refer to his deceased partner by saying ex, only by saying late or", "But being divorced before the death changes the dynamics of the relationship as well as the loss. Unless you\u2019re Priscilla Presley, apparently.", "... My dear, you are all of 25. And even if you were twice that it is not your place to question how someone mourns (provided they are not hurting themselves or others, of course). It implicitly places you in competition with the dead, which is never a good look.", "I hope she and her daughter do not attend. You\u2019ve insulted them. Hopefully someone buys you a book on manners as a gift. YTA", "So the man you are about to marry, if he dies in three years, you won\u2019t think if him after that?\n\nIf your answer is No, you may want to reconsider your marriage or at least let your future husband know he\u2019s expendable to you. I really hope you never find yourself in your aunt\u2019s predicament. \n\nYour aunt is allowed to grieve how she wants. She\u2019s allowed to decline an invitation. Your cousin is allowed to grieve her father. She\u2019s also allowed to decline an invitation. \n\nAlso YTA.", "Everyone grieves differently, it\u2019s not up to you to dictate how long she should. It might seem dramatic to you but those are real feelings to her that you can\u2019t understand.", "Look, if you\u2019re 25 and her first husband died over 20 years ago that means you\u2019ve spent your entire life knowing her second husband as your uncle. It\u2019s understandable you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know the date of his passing or foresee that your aunt spends part of that day grieving her first husband. \n\nBut once you learned that and still tried to make it about you or tried to guilt her into coming or told she should just get over it is when you crossed into asshole territory. Grief anniversaries are a thing, no matter how long it\u2019s been or that she\u2019s remarried.", "True facts"]}
