Listen to yourself for a second: you're outright saying \"I can't believe that my aunt won't set aside her feelings about her dead husband on the ***anniversary of his death*** to have fun at my wedding.\" It takes a lot of gall to try to make someone else's expression of grief about you.  \n\n\nIt doesn't matter that it's been 20+ years or that she's remarried or has a great new life with a daughter; those emotions can hang around forever, especially on major anniversary dates (and triply so on the date of someone's death).

Depending on if your cousin D is the child of your deceased uncle or the new husband, it may be too much for her as well and not just her supporting her mom (which itself is an acceptable excuse).  I still can't watch father/daughter dances at weddings and excuse myself to step outside every time even though it's been years...  I can't come to the terms that I never had that opportunity.

And in the 25 years without him, my grandmother spent every single day of her life eagerly awaiting death. She had a DNR, she was almost *joyful* anytime she was sick enough to be hospitalized, and would regularly decline to RSVP to events more than a month or so in the future because \u201chopefully I\u2019ll be dead by then\u201d. I firmly believe the only reason she didn\u2019t choose to end her life was because she was deeply religious and believed she would not go to heaven, where she was anticipating spending eternity with my grandfather. She was a deeply depressed and unhappy person every day after his death. And from what I know of my grandfather, that would have made him absolutely MISERABLE. \n\nWhen my own father passed when I was in my 20s, my mother was **traumatized** - as in, she watched him die next to her and tried to resuscitate him for 11 minutes while waiting for an ambulance. They had been together since they were kids, and there are no words to describe how unbelievably loud the sound of her heart shattering was. But in time, she became adamant that she wouldn\u2019t spend every day waiting for death like her own mother did, because she knew that was no way to live - and not at all what my father would want for her. So even when it\u2019s painful to witness moments she wishes my father were there to see, or to attend events she wishes my father were attending with her, or when she is faced with someone else\u2019s milestone moments that bring her back to her own milestones with him, she puts one foot in front of the other and keeps moving forward. \n\nThe first few \u201canniversaries\u201d of my father\u2019s death were so painful for my family and me.

I would likely decline an acquaintances wedding if it was on the anniversary as I like to spend it with my mom and sibling. But if it were a family member that I was close with, I wouldn\u2019t debate not attending - because I\u2019m not going to turn down opportunities to make meaningful memories with the people I love in favor of the memories of someone I\u2019ve lost.", "YTA\n\nShe is coming to the wedding, then declining your invite to the reception.

You will be too busy greeting people, taking pictures, doing all KINDS of stuff that when asked later, you simply will not be able to recall too many particulars of who was where and when.\n\nThis was my experience and has been the experience of every bride I've ever talked to except those who intentionally had very small weddings.\n\nSo - apologize to your aunt and cousin and reframe your perspective - it'll do you a lot of good.", "When there was a story like this about OP the bride losing a mother, and her sister asking her not to put her wedding on the death anniversary, when it had only been a couple years, (maybe only one year) everyone was saying NTA.

They are more like a 4th of July party.  If you are in the mood, you can have a good time.

I don\u2019t think I could. What she is doing is completely reasonable to. It\u2019s called setting boundaries for her emotional health. You were being unreasonable; you were being unacceptable by repeatedly pushing. The wedding is about you, but the day isn\u2019t. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.

Of all 365 days of the year, why did you pick that date?", "YTA and a spoiled bridezilla considering your parents supported your behavior.\n\nYour wedding is not the most important day in the lives of everyone you know despite what you may think.

You are not more important than their grief.", "NTA. It was over 20 years ago, and if still is this bad for her, that shes needs the attention on a day of joy, maybe grief counseling. You could also placate her by having a moment of silence for him. A day of joy you can share with that dead dude who brought so much joy to your aunt and family", "YTA I was waiting for you to say she wanted you to change the wedding date!  This is a hard day for her, and will always be a hard day for her - you don't understand that, so just be thankful that she's attending your ceremony, and leave it at that.  Trying to pressure her into attending a party on the anniversary of her husband's death is not cool.  It's great she remarried and has a good life, but it doesn't change the pain and grief she's been through.", "oh, YTA. You clearly do not understand how impactful this day is to your aunt.

It's not like she told you that she won't come at all.\n\nWhy does everything need to be about what you want all day long, anyway? This day is supposed to be about you and your spouse making a commitment to one another. Not who is there and what they are wearing or doing. \n\nApologize to your aunt, you don't know what she's gone through. You're seeing her life from the outside in.", "YTA she is attending and supporting you but not doing more than her grief can handle. When you lose someone you love there is no timeline. She's doing the best she can. Have some compassion", "Everyone is focusing on the fact that YTA which you very much are multiple times over. But I haven't seen anyone comment that your parents are AH too. You literally said that your parents agree with you. If that's true then I can see where you get the AH genes from, rotten apples don't fall far from the termite tree. You clearly have been lucky enough to not have experienced severe grief because you are being so disrespectful and if I was your aunt I would change my mind on going to the ceremony and just not go at all. How can someone be so full of themselves that other people's grief doesnt matter. Also her husband dying doesn't make him an ex husband it makes her a widow and him a deceased husband. Death doesn't make someone an Ex. If you're STBH were to die shortly after you were married would you change your stance or would you not care and move on? You are belittling her grief and that's NOT okay!", "Did you pick this day and not realize?  \nWhen she got the invitation and saw the day she may have thought I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel that day.

If you picked that day thinking it\u2019s been long enough she needs to move on.    Then that\u2019s not very good of you.   Sometimes even though it\u2019s been many years it could still be hard on someone.   Because you tend to think of all that you have lost.    Many people don\u2019t plan to be social on a day that is the anniversary of a death of someone who was very dear to them.    Because seeing everyone happy can just make you feel more sad.      Also she may be thinking\nWhy would she pick this day of all days?  And feel hurt that you couldn\u2019t have chosen a different day for a celebration of marriage and party.   It\u2019s a day very etched in her mind but maybe not so much for others", "YTA. This is not one of those situations where she pitched a fit about the date and demanded you change it just to make her feel better. She said she\u2019d make an effort to come to the ceremony and *when you asked* gave you a very gracious explanation why she wouldn\u2019t be there all day.

First: YTA -obviously.\u00a0\nI don't know If anybody here said this already, but what do you think is the appropriate time for your aunt and cousin to mourn this immense loss? How so you recon with the fact that someone you planned your life with is gone? Before their time, it seems? For you, it was maybe an uncle that wasn't there anymore. Given your age at the time (around 7?) it's only normal to not be able to comprehend this type of grief. You had an uncle at some point. And then he wasn't there anymore. That's it. For your aunt it was a whole life ahead, plans, children, memories and so much more. It doesn't matter If they're divorced (INFO: were they? Or is it just an 'ex' because he died, and were they married till the end?)\nEven if she was able to overcome this grief for a future for herself and look ahead to make her own path-the least you can give her is this day to remember him. Given that it's your wedding and I Hope you're getting married because of a connection and plans you're making with your S.O. you should be able to be emphatic for her and your cousins' situation. Shouldn't you?\u00a0", "When you say ex. Was your aunt separated/divorced  from her husband when he died?", "I think the aunt didn't want to deal with a long social obligation and is making an excuse to not go to the reception. Bride should just say, \"ok, thanks for coming to the ceremony!\" and ignore the rest of her excuse.  Aunt will just lean into the grief angle to get sympathy from the flying monkeys.", "YTA\n\nIt's an invitation, not a command to appear.  If she only wants to be there for part of it, WHATEVER the reason, that is her choice, not yours.  You can be disappointed in that but you don't get to reject her reasons, even if it is because she has to go home to paint he cat's claws.\n\nGrief is individual. I had a Grandmother and Great-grandmother die 3 days before and after my 8th birthday.  I hate my birthday 42 years later.  Should I just \"Get over it\"?  You are not the arbiter of when someone should have gotten over something unless it is you. \n\nGet over yourself and go apologize to your Aunt.", "YTA. If you wanted them at the wedding so badly then you wouldn't have picked the day their husband/father died to get married. Get over yourself.", "YTA...  \n\n\nJust curious, have you ever lost someone you love before \"their time\"?  I'm not talking about someone dying of old age (which also hurts but in a different way), I'm talking about someone dying young.  \n\n\nYou refer to your aunt's first husband, who died, and made her a widow, as her ex.  He is not an ex.  He died.  From your wording, he's also D's father.  And you don't understand why they may not feel like having a party?  She said she'd be there for the ceremony.  Honestly, you'll be so busy at the reception, you're likely to have not spent much/any time talking to either anyway.  \n\n\nOne of the people most important to me in my life died this summer (younger than me, unexpected) and I don't think I will ever be OK again.

That's hardly your business, much less a reason to be angry with her. What you said was actually terrible.", "Info: I'm confused about the ex. I assumed that they were divorced before he passed, but a lot of commenters assume otherwise. Were they divorced?", "YTA.  I imagine you haven't lost someone close to you like a spouse, child, or parent?  Once that happens you'll understand.  \n\nMy mother died at 45, unexpectedly, it was a relief.  However, I aint doing nothing on her death day, which is New Years Day.  Why? Because, nothing is really enjoyable on that day, many years later I remember the relief I felt in getting the call she died and the guilt for feeling that way, then the grief that she was a horrible parent.  \n\nYou don't get to tell someone to try to enjoy a day that was the anniversary of a terribly emotional moment/event.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t MAKE people enjoy your wedding.

Your aunt has said she will come to the ceremony, which is the important part, but want to avoid the party. I can completely understand that.

I hope you never have a true understanding of what your aunt is experiencing but your lack of empathy and understanding is awful, you come across as very cold and selfish.", "Aaassssshooooole.", "YTA. So freakin badly. There is no time limit on grief. I've lost several siblings, but the first one I lost was when I was 10 years old. According to your statements, because It's been nearly 30 years, I've gotten married, and had children, I should be 'over it by now'. That's not how grief works. My 3rd child was due the day before the 19th anniversary of my first brother dying. I was so panicked about having a baby on that day that my child needed to be delivered 10 days early. To this day, I get insanely depressed on the anniversary of his death, of all of their deaths TBH. You're lucky your aunt was willing to come to the ceremony. You owe your aunt and your cousin a huge apology.", "YTA and you totally just ruined any potential relationship with your aunt and cousin going forward.

It's MY day now so you HAVE to show up and be happy for ME.\"\n\nSounds bad right? That's you right now.", "YTA, I'm afraid. It sounds as though she sent you an RSVP clearly outlining what she would and wouldn't be staying for, which is her prerogative. An invitation is not a summons. You have no standing to insist that she modify her behaviour to suit your opinion, and it sounds as though you greatly overstepped in your response to her.", "YTA. Your aunt compromised as best she could by saying she would attend the ceremony. You are being selfish and uncaring, and mostly, lacking empathy here.

Most people never get closure from that, or from a child dying.
