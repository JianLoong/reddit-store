Listen to yourself for a second: you're outright saying \"I can't believe that my aunt won't set aside her feelings about her dead husband on the ***anniversary of his death*** to have fun at my wedding.\" It takes a lot of gall to try to make someone else's expression of grief about you.  \n\n\nIt doesn't matter that it's been 20+ years or that she's remarried or has a great new life with a daughter; those emotions can hang around forever, especially on major anniversary dates (and triply so on the date of someone's death).

Depending on if your cousin D is the child of your deceased uncle or the new husband, it may be too much for her as well and not just her supporting her mom (which itself is an acceptable excuse).  I still can't watch father/daughter dances at weddings and excuse myself to step outside every time even though it's been years...  I can't come to the terms that I never had that opportunity.

And in the 25 years without him, my grandmother spent every single day of her life eagerly awaiting death. She had a DNR, she was almost *joyful* anytime she was sick enough to be hospitalized, and would regularly decline to RSVP to events more than a month or so in the future because \u201chopefully I\u2019ll be dead by then\u201d. I firmly believe the only reason she didn\u2019t choose to end her life was because she was deeply religious and believed she would not go to heaven, where she was anticipating spending eternity with my grandfather. She was a deeply depressed and unhappy person every day after his death. And from what I know of my grandfather, that would have made him absolutely MISERABLE. \n\nWhen my own father passed when I was in my 20s, my mother was **traumatized** - as in, she watched him die next to her and tried to resuscitate him for 11 minutes while waiting for an ambulance. They had been together since they were kids, and there are no words to describe how unbelievably loud the sound of her heart shattering was. But in time, she became adamant that she wouldn\u2019t spend every day waiting for death like her own mother did, because she knew that was no way to live - and not at all what my father would want for her. So even when it\u2019s painful to witness moments she wishes my father were there to see, or to attend events she wishes my father were attending with her, or when she is faced with someone else\u2019s milestone moments that bring her back to her own milestones with him, she puts one foot in front of the other and keeps moving forward. \n\nThe first few \u201canniversaries\u201d of my father\u2019s death were so painful for my family and me.

I would likely decline an acquaintances wedding if it was on the anniversary as I like to spend it with my mom and sibling. But if it were a family member that I was close with, I wouldn\u2019t debate not attending - because I\u2019m not going to turn down opportunities to make meaningful memories with the people I love in favor of the memories of someone I\u2019ve lost.", "YTA\n\nShe is coming to the wedding, then declining your invite to the reception.

You will be too busy greeting people, taking pictures, doing all KINDS of stuff that when asked later, you simply will not be able to recall too many particulars of who was where and when.\n\nThis was my experience and has been the experience of every bride I've ever talked to except those who intentionally had very small weddings.\n\nSo - apologize to your aunt and cousin and reframe your perspective - it'll do you a lot of good.", "When there was a story like this about OP the bride losing a mother, and her sister asking her not to put her wedding on the death anniversary, when it had only been a couple years, (maybe only one year) everyone was saying NTA.

They are more like a 4th of July party.  If you are in the mood, you can have a good time.

I lost my mom three years ago and that pain is excruciating at times. You're spot on with everything you said about grief and how it ebbs and flows.\n\nOP, YTA. Your aunt was still coming to the ceremony. She was making an effort and compromise for you. You're an entitled brat.", "Ugh it used to piss me off to no end when someone called my late husband my ex. One \"friend\" of ours couldn't ever get it right, and it pretty much ended our friendship. It's been over seven years and I'm remarried, but it still sucks to hear that.", "My granma died last month, aged 98, and she was still grieving granpa, who died in 1976. OP needs to learn some compassion.", "When you say \u2018ex-husband\u2019 do you mean they divorced before he died or is she a widow?", ">I just think she's making a bit of a drama you know?\n\nThe only one making a drama is you. They didn't even say no to attending the whole day, just the reception. Your response should have been a gracious acceptance of their decision. I hate to break it to you, but the world doesn't revolve around you.\n\nYou're coming off immature, self-centred, and entitled. Honestly, you sound way too childish to be getting married.", ">I do get I might've been hurtful with what I said. I just think she's making a bit of a drama you know? \n\nSo then you *don\u2019t* get it, actually.   You\u2019re basically saying  \u201cI\u2019m not sorry if you were hurt because you deserved it\u201d\n\n\n\n>I'm not saying it wasn't tragic and painful for her, it surely was. \n\nHow insightful of you. \ud83d\ude44\n\n\n\n>But the reality is she was only 20 when she married him, and they were married for just 3 years. \n\nSo\u2026.? If your soon to be husband dies after 3 years I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be pretty damn sad about it. You have no right to pass judgment on her grieving process based on how long they were married. \n\n\n\n>I don't think a lot of people would spend 20+ years thinking of a relationship from their late teens/early 20s, to the point they won't attend their niece's reception. \n\nWhat vast knowledge do you have that you are basing this on? And why is your reception more important than whatever they have going on (grief or not)? It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons. You don\u2019t  have any right to demand people attend, and frankly this wedding is important to no one but you and your fianc\u00e9. \n\n\n\n>It's her choice at the end of the day though\n\nWhy yes. Yes it is. And she made her choice so stop being horrid about it. \n\n\n\n >(and I was also surprised my cousin said no to the reception as well)\n\nAgain, just because this wedding is important to you doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to drop what they\u2019re doing to attend to you. It seemed like everyone was being quite gracious with their refusals until you started acting entitled.", "\u201cShe married him\u201d\u2026aka, she intended to spend the rest of her life with this man. If your soon to be spouse dies in 3 years will you be over it in 20 years?", "Op you need to get over yourself.  Your wedding day is special for you but that doesn't mean it is the center of the universe for everyone else.   Aunt said she'd come to the ceremony, which IMO is probably more important than the reception since its where you actually get married.", "I've known and been dating my bf for 3 years. I'm around the same age as you. If he suddenly died, I don't even know if I'd be able to continue on living without him. Maybe my family, his family, friends, and our pets would be able to tie me down to this world, but I can't even imagine the pain I would go through, I'm tearing up at the thought of it now. I might be able to date again as time passes, but I'd never get over loss of him and the future we could've had together.", "i truly hope you never experience the type of loss that makes it hard after 20 years on the day they died. YTA and incredibly selfish and rude to them.", "No, your being dramatic by acting like a toddler bc she has openly said she isn\u2019t coming to your reception. \nHer deceased husband in her eyes was the love of her life and who she chose to spend her life with. He was taken from her. You will never understand that unless it happens to you.\n\nSo back off your aunt and let her celebrate you by coming to the ceremony and then going home or whatever she needs to do for herself.", "YTA\n\nYou sound so cold hearted, the person you're marrying must feel so lucky. \n\nIt is not your place to question how long other people grieve their loved ones. You are incredibly entitled. Your special day does not trump her day of loss. It's sad that some of your family members support you in this but I guess you're all assholes.", "You\u2019re marrying your partner now at 25. If they died in three years, do you think you\u2019d \u2018get over it\u2019 or would the loss of someone you hoped you\u2019d spend the rest of your life with, and the loss of that life, be painful and traumatic? \n\nIf it wouldn\u2019t be idk why you\u2019re marrying your fianc\u00e9. If it is, you should show more compassion to your aunt. It\u2019s been twenty years but she\u2019s allowed to be sad at the life she didn\u2019t get to live", "The only person creating drama is you.  You think that on your wedding day you'll have time to focus on if she is there or not? You'll have so many damn guests that you're not even going to be able to assess who is and who isn't there.  Yet you're choosing this battle.  For what?  To make it known that you're the most important person in the world on that day? You're a massively entitled AH.", "Imagine being 25 years old and still this immature lmao. You must be a neon haired figurine, it's hard to imagine someone like you is real. \n\n>and I was also surprised my cousin said no to the reception as well\n\nThat's probably because you suck and she was looking for an out to not attend your party.", "Since we are talking about drama, what about you picking a date that coincided with the day the aunt\u2019s husband died?\n\nYes, your aunt has built a new life for herself. Still, specific dates are always hard. YTA", "Dear God. Life is going to hit you so hard when you grow up.", "You do realize people skip either the ceremony or the reception all the time, right?\n\nLike, this is just normal operating procedures for a wedding. People love you, they want to celebrate your wedding with you but they have other commitments. And maybe they cant sacrifice a whole day for you. \n\nAnd Im talking about \"normal\" obligations like their work schedule, or their dog's separation anxiety.\n\nAnd the proper response is: \"We will be so happy to have you!\"", "Wow I can't believe the level of condescension and dismissiviness you are displaying for someone else's grief. You are very fortunate to have never experience the loss of a spouse. I hope you never have to experience that type of loss, but if you do I hope their will be people in your life who show you more patience and understanding than you seem to have for your aunt. There is no time table on grief. Your aunt isn't causing drama you are by insisting that she put aside her grief to make you happy. She is still planning on attending your ceremony she knows that because of the date she won't be in the mood to celebrate and attend a wedding reception. YTA", "So you want her to sit there, on the anniversary of the death of her true love, and listen to people wish you and your new husband long lives and lasting love? This woman who had her husband for three years, an eyeblink, you want her to sit there on the *anniversary of his loss* and celebrate someone else's upcoming entire life of happiness?\n\nYou don't think that's a bit gauche?", "Oh yes I was right. You absolutely are cruel. Love is love. It's not a \"relationship\" it was a *marriage.*", "You're acting like they broke up. He DIED. Just like you probably hope to spend the rest of your life with your partner. That was her hopes as well and unfortunately she didn't get to have that because his life was cut short. Grief doesn't just magically go away.", "You're very young and have clearly never experienced a serious loss. I will give you a soft YTA for cluelessness, but YTA for sure and you owe your aunt an apology. Please listen to these comments. There's a reason the verdict is clear!", ">But the reality is she was only 20 when she married him, and they were married for just 3 years.\n\nThis makes it even more traumatic. She was expecting a lifetime and only got 3 years. They were robbed of their future together. Moving on and getting married again doesn't change the past and it doesn't make it not hurt. \n\n>I don't think a lot of people would spend 20+ years thinking of a relationship from their late teens/early 20s\n\nThis wasn't just a relationship that broke up. It was a marriage that tragically ended due to death. When he died, they were very much in love and she never had the chance to fall out of love. No matter how much time passes, he's still the same amazing person for her with all those memories. \n\nYou're only thinking about yourself right now and not considering how your aunt feels. Her husband died very young on the day you're getting married. How is she not supposed to think about him in that setting? How do you think that will impact the mood of the reception? She's trying to be considerate of you and support you without taking apart. Try to appreciate her efforts.", "OP, this post right here tells me you're not mature enough to be married.", "Not might, it was. What you said was cruel(is this your cousins father who passed away) she still plans on celebrating with you, she will be going to the ceremony, get over yourself, thank her for taking time out of what is a very hard day and let her know you appreciate it. YTA,", "You are the one making drama, and you clearly do not understand how deep grief can change a person's life forever. Your aunt is supporting you as best she can and you are saying her best isn't enough for you. You are the one bringing other people into the mix to be your flying monkeys and hound her into fulfilling your requirements. \n\nIf it is so crucial to you the your aunt attend all the festivities on your wedding day, simply move the date to one that doesn't gut her every year. But stop harassing a grieving widow.", "I have been married for 3 years, and I can guarantee that is my husband passed I would never get over it. If you can not see how much of an asshole you are being then I really don\u2019t think you should be getting married.", "So, she was young when she married, and the person she planned to spend her whole life with died young, and you seem to think that should somehow be LESS traumatic?\n\nJesus you are cold. Selfish and cold. \n\nYou clearly know less than nothing about grief. You don\u2019t even know enough to know you don\u2019t know anything about it. You\u2019d do better to shut your mouth on topics you know nothing about.", "Even if she\u2019s holding too tight to the past, and even if she\u2019s excessively emotional, and even if she does need to enjoy those who are living more\u2026..it\u2019s really not your place to pass the judgement.   Her grief is something she needs to deal with on her own or with professionals.  It isn\u2019t any of your business and you were TA in how you handled this situation.", "Bottom line, it\u2019s most certainly not up to you to dictate how she feels or grieves. Some things never go away", "You absolutely do NOT get it. If you can't understand why she would still grieve her late husband (not \"ex\" btw) then I don't think you're mature enough to get married. \n\nI was widowed at 27 after five years of marriage. Even though I have remarried, I still mourn my late husband on our wedding anniversary, his birthday, and his death day. If a close family member or friend had a big celebration on his death day, I probably wouldn't want to attend either and would have a plan to leave as discreetly as possible when the time came. \n\nGrow up and realize that you are not the main character in anyone else's life.", "YTA. It's not just about him dying. It's about him missing the rest of her life, as well as her child's. Every time there's a milestone she has to remember that the man she had chosen to spend the rest of her life with is gone. Every time your cousin has a milestone, they probably both remember and think about how they wish he was there. You need to work on your empathy.", "YTA. How bloody self absorbed are you? Frankly, nobody cares about your wedding except you. You need to get over yourself", "My great grandmother died in 2000. I was 9. I'm still fucked up over her death. Let people mourn.", "Okay now you are just being a brat. YTA. It doesn't matter if she was married for 3 years or 20. You don't get to control how people deal with grief. She could have known for him longer too. She could have grown up with him. How would you feel if you lost your fianc\u00e9 after 3 years being married him? You have no clue what bond she had with him, so please grow up. She's coming for the ceremony, be happy for that. Going based off your attitude, I wouldn't want to go either if I was your aunt or cousin. Compassion goes a long way.", "You are a cold person. I wish your future marriage partner all the best, sounds like they'll need it.", "If your soon to be husband died tomorrow, are you saying you'd get over it? If so, why are you even marrying him if he means so little to you? I think you're too immature to be married and a callous, soulless person if you are ready throw your fianc\u00e9e down a hole and never speak of him again.", "It sounds like, fortunately for you, you've not dealt with heavy grief.  There is no expiration date on emotion.  YTA, and I hope you take this as a learning experience.  You owe your aunt an apology.", "My brother died just barely a year after he married my sister in law. She is dating again and exploring that, but it doesn't matter how long ago it was, she will always carry him with her. She still remembers him on their wedding anniversary, his birthday, and the anniversary of the day he passed. She doesn't spend the days in sack clothe and ashes, but she still takes time to remember him. \n\nAnd are you really surprised that your cousin may not want to go to a party on anniversary of their father's death?", "Was he your cousin\u2019s dad or is the second husband her father?", "Echoing what your aunt said. I sincerely hope you never have to go through a loss like she has", "When someone who you loved and expected to spend to your life together dies, it tends to be something you deal with FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.", "I'm 33 and had a younger cousin who I was very close to (saw her as my little baby, I'm 4 years older) she died in 2001. \nI was 12 and it  hit hard, she's been gone for 21 years this December and on the day of her passing, I still light a candle for her. \nIt took 17 years to stop hating the month of December. \n\nEveryone grieves loss differently, he was probably her first real love, someone she saw herself growing old with. Of course she's going to feel some way on they date for the rest of her life. She also likely has something special she does every year to commemorate his life. \n\nYTA. Your entitled to your feelings, but so is she.

Get over yourself!\n\nYour Aunt said she would attend the ceremony, which really is the most important part of your wedding when you exchange vows.\n\nYour cousin is supporting her Mother after you dismissed her feelings and reasons for not attending the reception.\n\nWhy do you get to decide that because they\"were married for just 3 years\" she should forget about the day he died?  She had a child with him. She planned on spending the rest of her life with him (kind of like what you are doing by getting married).\n\nEveryone is different in how they grieve.

Really? That is extremely ironic coming from a bride; you getting married is questionable because you can\u2019t even respect other people\u2019s marriages.\n\nYTA and please self-reflect. I\u2019m telling you for your own good you shouldn\u2019t keep defending your wrong actions because Reddit WILL lay it on you harder.", "I'm not suprised at all. I don't know the date of my mother's death and sure don't know the death date of any of my uncle's. \n\nRemembering relative's birthdays is tough enough.

Thanks for sharing that.", "Yep, they don't leave, they just become very delayed :)", "Pardon?", "Which is why they bring it up. You assume they were divorced before his death. We're pretty sure he died during their marriage, and OP is incorrectly using ex-husband", "I keep thinking, OP is a *young* 25. I was at least ten years younger when I understood that grief is a thing you don't always get to put down, that some losses change you permanently. Getting this old and not knowing it? The first time OP experiences that knowledge it's likely to be very, very personal.", "All of this", "I imagine she'd be super pissed if her fiance said that he'd only mourn her until he remarried, because by then he'll be \"over it\" and she won't be important anymore.", "She really thinks that remarrying after the death of a spouse is just a restart and the first marriage doesn't matter anymore. And it's ridiculous that she thinks it matters even less because they got married young and he died after only three years. Like wtf.", "The way I read it was OP expects that her Aunt should have moved on because she has her second husband, and OP's cousin, who is the second father's daughter. Hence having no reason in OP's opinion not to attend. \n\nExcept that OP was seriously cruel to her Aunt. OP's Cousin might not want to attend just because of the way her mother was treated.", "I only know my uncle's death date because he died on my aunt's (his wife) birthday. Other than that, the only death dates I know of are my own late husband's and my sister's best friend (and only because hers is the day before my husband's)."]}
