This is not a kind of situation where I'm constantly agitated at her for incompetence or anything like that. I would be more than happy to microwave a burrito. I would be more than happy to whip up a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. \n\nBut I can't. My wife has, every single night of our marriage, done the same thing: she'll make me a tiny dinner. I'm talking like a Chinese chicken salad with 30 grams of chicken and ten leaves of lettuce arranged fashionably with dressing. When I finish eating, I'm still hungry because for a 230 pound man who works a physical labor job, it's not enough food. \n\nAt first, I tried to openly communicate with her, but she always took it horribly. She would adopt a thousand-yard stare, and then begin talking about how incompetent she is and how she can't even make her husband a proper dinner. I'd try to calm her down with \"Oh honey that's not the case! I just eat too much\" or \"Don't worry about it. I can make a bit more.\" I'd try to be overwhelmingly positive. It never helped. She would always just get incredibly disappointed in herself, cry, and/or take it out on me.\n\nThen she would make the same exact amount the following day.\n\nAfter the communication route failed, I tried to eat her dinners as-is. It became hard to sleep at night due to hunger and I lost seven pounds in the first month.\n\nEventually I figured out my own system. On my way home from work, I started swinging by a fast food restaurant and getting myself a burger. I would basically pregame her meals with some more calories. I figured it was win-win, as what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and I could have my fill of food. I would eat on my way home, walk in the door, pick at the salad or quinoa or homemade Mac and Cheese she made, compliment her for her delicious cooking, and later dispose of the wrappers discretely. \n\nTwo days ago I was on my way home and in line at a drive-through. My MIL was coming out of the restaurant. She ran over and greeted me. I asked her in a humorous way not to tell her daughter where she saw me because she'd take it badly, and she agreed, but then she narced on me anyway. I got home to a furious wife who demanded details. When I provided the truth she got extremely angry and looked legitimately hurt.\n\nI'm not good at handling confrontation and feel like I betrayed my wife in some way.

Breaking down crying whenever anyone offers commentary and then turning it around to beat herself up way out of proportion how horrible she is and what a failure she is, so that the person making the comment has to comfort her and console her and try to make her feel better and reassure her and forget all about their complaint - that's pretty abusive, making it all about her, instead of acknowledging what has been said and thinking about what can be done to make amends.My mom is like that, whenever i brought up all the abuse she did to me as a child, wanting her to acknowledge being wrong and maybe apologize, she'd start crying and begging and apologizing in a dramatic groveling way, like literally dropping down to her knees scream-crying and cursing herself saying she's the worst human being on planet, horrible mother, doesn't deserve to live, yada yada yada, all that just in order to avoid apologizing and facing the fact that she did something wrong. It's literally impossible to talk to her, anything is taken and turned around to a situation where you have to comfort her and offer her love and reassurance that she's not the worst and etc. It's all about her and her feelings. So that she doesn't have to actually acknowledge and talk about what she did. The person making the complaint is left completely invalidated and unheard, all their complaints completely discarded and the full focus is on the person who did wrong, and on trying to comfort them and pull them out of their misery and reassure them how wonderful/not bad they are", "NTA, your wife clearly has some sort of hang up around food- whether that\u2019s an eating disorder or she\u2019s just trying to get you to lose weight without actually talking to you about it is anyone\u2019s guess as we don\u2019t know her personally, but there\u2019s definitely more at play here. It\u2019s not hard at all to double a recipe and make more so that your SO can have enough to eat, and in most cases isn\u2019t really even much extra work, so the fact that she\u2019s unwilling to do it and is making you feel like the bed guy simply for requiring a higher caloric intake than her due to your job and activity level really isn\u2019t a rational/healthy response to the situation.", "NTA - your wife is playing the victim here. \n\nPlot twist, do some grocery shopping, buy yourself some streaks and just make yourself dinner.

If my husband came to me about this, I would one, be happy he cared enough to talk to me about it bc we dont know we're doing something wrong if no one tells us. Two, I would 100% make the change.

Or perhaps counseling? \n\nHas this ever been an issue before you were married? Did she attempt to make you have the same meal as her in restaurants or in other dining situations? Her controlling the entire approach to eating within the household & having a meltdown if it\u2019s not taken as the be all & end all for your satiation seems to hint at a much larger issue.

The first time when your wife was getting upset when you would bring it up and you would back off and say you ate too much or would just make more, you were effing it up then. You don't just cave to someone being passive aggressive or dramatic. No matter what she says. You be honest about your needs. Also, at some point you should have started taking over on the cooking or making yourself your own food at home. I don't see anything wrong with you going out and getting fast food, I do see something wrong with asking her mother not to tell her and making a deal about how she reacts, not because she reacts well but because you don't ask a family member not to tell their child something that their spouse is doing that will hurt their feelings, especially when this should have been dealt with in the first place a long time ago. \n\nThis is a great example of how not dealing with something up front when it happens, and instead backing down and catering to someone else's irrational feelings gets you absolutely nowhere, and creates a bigger issue than it was to begin with. And that part is your fault. Own it, stand your ground, and come up with a proper solution this time to requiring more calories and nutrition for your body. If she pushes back, tell her you've made an appointment for her and you to see a registered dietitian so she can hear it from someone else.

That really is all that matters.\n\nBut If this was her starving a child would you still think that it\u2019s \u201cnot her fault because mental illness\u201d?

That still isn\u2019t an excuse. She sounds like an extremely controlling person when it comes to food and possibly other things as well.\n\nMaybe she feels the need to control everyone to \u2018protect\u2019 them. It may be that she feels out of control and is terrified because of that.", "Someone struggling with mental health and in denial about it acting unfairly to others? How shocking! /s\n\nIt's clearly not okay but no one is suggesting that the wife's eating disorder is an excuse.", "Behavior like this doesn't have to be about control of people (yet it certainly can be). It can also just be about control of circumstances, combined with other issues that cause the hostility, lack of empathy, and lack of self reflection. The low self esteem described by OP makes me lean that way. \n\nIn that case therapy could help, while if it's just about control of people OP is in for a few ... educational years before divorce.", "The fact that OP would consider eating to avoid being hungry at night a AITA-question speaks volumes.\nYou need to have a serious conversation with her and she needs to realise that this is not it any way about her.\n\nPerhaps you can cook dinner and show her what a normal portion (for you) looks like?\n\nIf the roles had been reversed people would probably be calling you all sorts of names for letting her go hungry to bed or being forced to eat before dinner to avoid it.\n\nThis needs to be added asap.

I\u2019m just saying maybe once a week do it to start off and relieve her so she can rest.  Maybe you both could make dinner together? Maybe this could be something you do together?  IDK but she sounds very passive aggressive and immature.\n\nI used to make my ex-husband so much food we always have leftovers so he could bring it to work the next day. Now he\u2019s married to someone exactly like your wife and she doesn\u2019t even know how to cook.  She boils chicken breast for dinner for goodness sake\u2019s.  Plain up in water.

This is a pretty shitty situation and I hope OP navigates it well.", "That's not a solution, because the issue isn't being able to feed himself, it's his wife's emotional response. She would obviously freak out the same way if he started cooking his own food, and that's the root of the problem.", "Agreed.

Ours went through phases when he\u2019d eat like he was an entire football team.

And if that was the case, him realising he lost 7 pounds in a month wouldn't be worrying to him, but clearly it is. He sees he's lost weight and thinks, oh shit I'd better find a way to eat more. I don't think an overweight person would think like that? Maybe his wife wants him skinnier, but it doesn't sound like OP actually needs to lose weight. Could be wrong, but   that's how it comes across from the post.", "NTA \n\nIt definitely sounds like your wife has some mental issues that she needs to work on.  Whether that be control or eating disorders. I encourage you to contact NEDA (national eating disorders association) for insight and help. I also encourage you to call your primary and make an appointment.   \n\nDiscuss this situation with them, and then use it as a guise to bring up your weight loss to her.  They can point you in the right direction for mental healthcare for her and maybe get a plan set up.  Then say, Honey, Doc is worried about the weight I lost since my last appointment.  They want to make sure that I'm eating enough calories.  So I'm going to track my calories throughout the day, but I'll need a dinner that's at least 1000 kcal.

She absolutely is. The control over food aside, the way she turns any conversation about it into her not being a good enough wife is manipulation, pure and simple. She's DARVO-ing and is the only reason no one is picking up on it because she is a woman?? That grow a spine comme is awful.

I binge for lunch and late night snack, and that's just how I do it, and it works for me, but I would never put that on a partner.
