Your aunt sounds awful - as you say she\u2019s fine to be obsessed with her own skin, anti-ageing and stuff but pushing it onto everyone around her is not okay. Her comments about your mum were so horrible, it\u2019s understandable that you got upset with her over it.", "NTA --- Ask her long is it supposed to be before it starts to work.", "NTA - she\u2019s a dummy, don\u2019t listen to her. Just because she\u2019s older doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't give her the time of day.", "NTA \nWhat\u2019s the point in living if you can\u2019t even enjoy laughter? Your aunt sounds miserable & like she\u2019s having a middle age crisis too early", "NTA - she's bought into the idea that she can buy her youth and she's sorely mistaken. You're right to think she's insufferable. She'll realize she's still getting old in about 5 years, and hopefully, she'll feel silly for wasting all of this money trying to halt something totally natural. \n\nKeep pushing back and standing up for yourself. If you feel you have to apologize, apologize for your tone, but remind her that you still believe everything you said and you're going to laugh wrinkles into your face all you want. What is she going to remember on her death bed? Laughter, or the fact that she didn't get 11 lines til she was 50?", "NTA. Your aunt makes life for everyone around her difficult.\n\n1. Since when is being gay an inheritable trait? \n2. Botox faces are boring as hell. Facial expressions are part of non-verbal communication.\n3. Just my opinion, but I find people with smile lines much more attractive than smooth botox foreheads.\n4. Your aunt is a prime example how tiktok is enabling people to loose common sense.", "NTA. Good on you for defending your mom against your aunt's cruelty. Your aunt's obsession with anti-aging and looking young is a symptom of her internalized misogyny, and she should keep that self-hatred to herself if she can't be bothered to go to therapy about it.\n\nAlso, your Bubbie rules. As a fellow Jew, her snark about their activities on Tisha B'av had me cackling.", "ESH I'm sorry, she's annoying as tar and you have the patience of a saint for putting up with it that long. But you blew up *hard* at her. There is something between nothing and everything, you know. It sounds something like \"I don't think we're ever going to agree on that topic and we always argue, so I'd rather not discuss it with each other.\" And stick to that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
