You still took him out to the movies and spent time with him like you planned to.", "NTA but you ex is.  Sounds like she fed him on purpose to screw up you plans.\n\nThe best advice I got was send everything via email.  I would send her an email saying as per our discussion I didn\u2019t take him for his bday dinner because you fed him 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and a bowl of soup and he was no longer hungry.\n\nThis way it covers your butt if she turns vindictive and tries to say you never feed him when you said you would.", "You made the right decision.\n\nShe did not.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She fed him a *full meal*, not just a snack to hold him until dinner. You even asked if he wanted to eat and he said he was stuffed. He didn\u2019t seem upset or sad but your ex asked about the meal- was she hoping he would be too full and bring home leftovers?", "NTA, he ate. You checked to see if the kid was hungry enough for an additional meal. Kiddo said no, so you carried on with another event you two could enjoy. Mom being upset is a little weird given kid said they were good. Makes it seem like she was expecting food.", "NTA. I was absolutely ready to judge you TA.  But reading this your ex sabotaged your time with your son by feeding him. I have no doubt she did this on purpose. Whether, to get a doggy bag or just ruin the dinner I'm not sure, but she is definitely TA.", "NTA. Just take him next time. Don\u2019t mention to mom", "NTA why would you waste the money when he already ate? Why would she fix him food like that knowing your plans? She could have just given him a tiny snack. Maybe next time you can take him for that special dinner.", "Came here to say this.   \nNTA, OP.", "Lol idk why she couldn\u2019t have just fed him a bowl of soup to tide him over before dinner.", "Abusive partners often leave the abused one feeling bad for their honest actions.", "i thought the same thing!!!", "That doesn't make him an AH.", "It's like you only focused on the monetary part of the post.  \nYou failed to see where he asked the kid if he was still hungry and he said he 'was stuffed'.  So the entire first half of your post is worthless.", "Someone else suggested she might have done it so the son brought home leftovers she could steal and OP responded that he never thought of that possibility but that his son does usually take home a doggybag.", "You need a formal custody arrangement, my friend. Making her mad might result in her withholding him from you and you have zero protections at the moment.", "That seems like a red flag. You should split up with her", "Ask your son if he ever eats the leftovers himself.  If so, is it every time?  I bet not.", "it requires half as much effort to make 1 grilled cheese as it does to make 2. You don't just on a whim make 2 for someone for a snack.  Mom had to know she was making a meal and not a snack.", "I will make my own judgements.  Thanks", "Yes exactly. If his ex asks, OP can reply, \"I'm not exactly sure what our plans are. We will figure it out as we go.\" \n\nOP's ex needs an info diet.\n\nETA: NTA", "That's why i thought she just wants the doggy bags and was not amused that there wasn't any...

And they had, after *she*  gave him a full meal where a snack would have been enough...", "You think kids dont like steak or something?", "Some kids do. My kids are extremely picky but both are fans of a good medium steak, and they pay attention to the restaurant.", "tbh that's not really a significantly better scenario. She's still messing with their dinner plans for her own benefit, even if the benefit is that she doesn't have to spend money or time prepping the kid another meal instead of eating it herself.", "I'm gonna make a whole ass dinner so I don't have to make lunch for tomorrow. This will be my most diabolical lick yet!", "A snack would be half a sandwich or a cup of soup at most. A better choice would be a couple of baby carrots or celery. No, his mother ruined the trip to the steak house by feeding him a huge meal. I don\u2019t know how old this kid is, but a bowl of soup and 2 sandwiches sounds excessive even for a full meal. She wanted him stuffed! Your ex deliberately sabotaged your trip.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say anything now or in the future. Don\u2019t tip your hand that you know. She\u2019d deny it anyway. Just don\u2019t broadcast what you plan on doing, and no more doggy bags in the future. Well, unless it\u2019s something like French fries. If she asks just say it\u2019s a surprise. If she gets pushy, just say you don\u2019t want to risk her feeding him a full meal it like she did this last time, and switch the subject. \n\nGood luck!", "I mean the soup I can get IF there were no crackers but two sandwiches and a bowl of soup?", "Oh and 10 oysters with mignonette on the side. Extra sauce please.", "The laugh I just laughed", "[removed]", "I\u2019m a pretty big dude and two grilled cheese sandwiches and a bowl of tomato soup would make me uncomfortably stuffed. That said, I\u2019m also not the bottomless pit that a youngin\u2019 can be but it was obviously a lot for the kid too.\n\nThe only options I can reach are that she\u2019s fucking dumb or malicious.", "Exactly. I\u2019m a grown assed woman and this is three small meals or one supper sized meal AND a lunch for me.

You think i'm going to let my kid eat all that damn candy anyways? She doesn't even really know it but she only gets a portion of what she gets on halloween. Way too much junk.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with doling out the candy to keep the kids from getting sick.  My parents had to do that with my brothers or they\u2019d eat it all in a few hours!

You are NTA.\n\nShe knew the plan.  Your son knew the plan.  There is no reason that she should have served him a full meal right before you were going to take him out to eat a full meal.  Give him a little snack?  Sure.  An apple or a banana or something.  NO WAY should she have served him a whole ass meal.", "NTA-the AH here is  your ex.  This was done either on purpose or with considerable lack of concern.  If he was hungry she should have given him something just to tide him over.", "Info:\n\nIs your son upset? That's all the really matters because it was a celebration for him.", "NTA\n\nShe's pissed because she doesn't get free fancy food. Glad you and your kid got to do something fun regardless!", "Call it what you want but it pure sabotage. She could have made him half a sandwich and a small cup of soup to tide him over but nope! She made him 2 sandwiches and a bowl of soup. She absolutely knew the plan and don\u2019t tell me she didn\u2019t know the consequences of her actions. She\u2019s a grown women.
