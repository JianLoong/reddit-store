(So he's NTA here either.)\n\nYour ex-wife is an AH for being mad at you (apparently because she didn't get a whole expensive meal of leftovers) after *she* set up the situation.

If I read correctly it isn't even the kid who is upset but his mother on his behalf. What did she even expect? Should you have force-fed him or something? You could take him to that restaurant some other time and he probably would be much happier about it when he actually is hungry. NTA", "NTA. Your ex kind of is for feeding him right before he was going out to dinner with you.  If I was more jaded I might think she filled him up so he would bring home a doggy bag of good food for her.", "NTA. Your ex sabatoged your plans, she can take him to the steakhouse the next time he's hungry. What were you supposed to do, make your kid sick? Sounds like you still had fun at the movies.", "yta. for this line alone. my ex has full custody I only see him when he has th time mainly weekends. congratulations you're a Disney dad.", "NTA\n\nAssuming your son enjoyed his trip to the movie and was not upset about the change.

The steakhouse will be there for later.  And mom is doing sone weird passive aggressive shit here,  or is just using an astounding lack of judgement.

If mom knew son was excited to go to dinner, then she should\u2019ve just made him a snack.\n\nNTA", "NTA: if the lids happy then why his mom gotta be upset.", "NTA. Plain and simple. \nAnd kudos for rolling with the punches and doing what your son enjoyed rather than sticking to the plan for appearances (like many parents would have done!). \nDon\u2019t worry about your ex, who knows what she is thinking (probably think you disappointed your son, which you clearly didn\u2019t).", "INFO: Was your son ok with the change in plans?

Of course you made the right decision.", "Most kids don\u2019t make good decisions. They\u2019re not cognitively developed. That\u2019s what parents are for", "NTA.  2 grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup is running about 800 calories.  Who eats after that?  ex wife is the AH for pestering you about not bringing the kid to a restaurant.", "NTA. If he is fine with it, it's not really any of her business. She's the one that prepared him an ***entire meal*** beforehand, he could have had 1 grilled cheese to keep him content in the meantime.", "Agreed. She knew of the steakhouse plan and still made him TWO sandwiches and soup. Any parent knows their kid's capacity for food so she knew exactly what she was doing. Then, to try to make it into a thing to drive a wedge between father and son when she's to blame? Oh, hell no. She's the AH. OP is definitely NTA.", "Wow. I never even thought of that.  He has taken home doggy bags constantly from our times together.", "Ah! Yes, you cracked the case I think", "And if he had made the kid sick,  she'd have used it as a weapon against him.  Or she was hoping to fill the kid up so his leftovers became hers.", "Totally agree she sabotaged their plans.  Most parents would have said to their kids that they are going out to eat soon so just have a piece of fruit or something like that.  Instead she made 2 sandwiches and soup, that's more than I would have for a normal meal.  OP is definitely NTA.", "So, he's an asshole for a custody agreement through the court system? Make it make sense.", "Seriously?\n\nMy brother wanted full custody of his kids. The kids wanted to live with him. He was forced to share custody with his ex-wife. \n\nHe wanted full physical custody of his kids. He got one weeknight from after school to 8 pm, and Saturdays from 9 am to 7 pm.\n\nHis ex also graciously allowed him to do all the soccer/hockey/ballet/ski  transportation to and from practice/lessons/games. Because she didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nIt was a nasty divorce because his ex wanted much more money than he could afford and when the judge determined she couldn\u2019t have all the money she wanted, she fought tooth and nail to keep the kids away from him, just to hurt him. She was the one who wanted the divorce.\n\nSometimes dads don\u2019t get as much custody as they would like.", "Very presumptuous statement!\nOP likely doesn\u2019t have suitable housing, income, and family environment.", ".... the kid can eat 2 grilled cheese and a bowl of soup in one sitting. Pretty sure we are not talking about a toddler that cries himself to sleep and crave a masculine model, but a teenager with his own life that had limited time to give to his dad and probably is too old for that \"1 week there other week elsewhere\" bullshit. At that age, kids get to choose where they want to go. OP is N T A for respecting his kid's wishes and still staying involved.\n\nWho are you to judge other people's custody agreement, if everybody involved is fine with it ?!?", "This is such a bizarre take. I know many co-parents who don't have official custody agreements.", "Tadaa, here we go. This was exact my thought when i read your post. \"Hm, is he taking doggy bags home?\" \n\nMaybe you can try to do activities with him, without eating anywhere else?
