So how does that make OP in the wrong?", "Or she was hopeful of kid to bring home the extra for her to eat", "I'd ask him basically and subtly if he enjoys the leftovers from your guys outings.\n\nSomething like, \"sometimes the leftovers are even better the next day, do you look forward to them?\"\n\nJust as a way of getting information without letting the kid realize what information you're getting. \n\nIt would be very sad of true but unfortunately in my time of watching people co-parent poorly it wouldn't surprise me", "Yep especially since your son isn't mad, only she is. That's a red flag to me.", "Maybe next time when you plan to go to eat with him you can make the reservation for 3-4 hours later and in that time you can go to a  park (playing will make him starve) or something that he enjoys doing.\n\nThis way, even if he's stuffed when he goes out, by the time you end up eating he will eat everything.\n\nNTA", "Oh yea, that crossed my mind as well...", "Two grilled cheeses and soup? How about just giving him a snack to tide him over? One needn\u2019t eat until \u201cstuffed\u201d to avoid being hungry.", "This is what I imagine is true.

He would always ask if she got her card which she always said yes, but she never mentioned the gift card. I finally asked her casually one day when she was visiting us if she liked getting to use her gift cards. She had no clue. Turns out her mom was using them for herself. After that, my husband started letting her know that he was sending a greeting card and X gift card with $x amount on it. Her mom didn\u2019t like that!\n\n(She also would open any gifts he sent to their daughter so she could go buy something better\u2026 like he would always send the gifts early to make sure they were there on time and would ask her to wait til the day of the holiday to open them. Day of comes around and his daughter would be like \u201cyeah, mommy had me open my presents a week ago but look at this cool thing better than yours!\u201d He now sends her gifts after the holiday and her mom gets so salty about that, like she will even go and buy more presents and throws a second party just to one-up him.)", "I don't think your son made a bad decision here, your ex did. That sounds awfully suss, she fed him 2 sandwiches right before dinner? I think she wanted you to look bad..", "Yep. Time to stop telling the mom your plans or start making up plans since she tries to sabotage them for herself", "The son obviously wasn't THAT stuffed if he had room for soda and popcorn...  movie theater popcorn with that fake \"butter\" is pretty filling.", "What kind of nonsense is this? First of all, not everyone installs an official custody agreement. Some co-parents are happy to keep it casual. Secondly, and more importantly, what's best for the kid isn't necessarily a 50/50 split. Work schedules, geographic location, social opportunities etc are often factored. \n\nOP has permission to walk into his exes home and works around his son's availability. Sounds like a pretty healthy co-parenting relationship in general.", "Do you know nothing about how custody works??", "Did you have a Disney dad?  It sounds like you had a Disney dad and are projecting your resentment on OP.  You should try therapy, or a support group.

I had a SIL that when my mom sent gifts to my nephews she would regift them as being from her or. My mom didn\u2019t believe me when I said she needed to tell them she was sending something when I told her (SIL) that I would like videos of them opening their gifts. Then one year she got back together with my brother and showed up for Christmas, and some of the presents my nephews opened were things my mom had sent over the year. She wanted to know what happened to the things she bought that my brother and SIL are buying \u2018 new ones\u2019 . Mom learnt the hard way, but my nephews have no idea any if this happened.

I really should be more ashamed than I am, I guess.", "This is only somewhat true if your kids get a tiny amount of candy. \n\nMine hauled home 3 lbs of mostly chocolate each, it\u2019s absolutely fine to help out in that situation!"]}
