Him and his ex wife have/had (now full with my boyfriend) two older dogs who have been around the toddler since he was born. One dog hides every time my boyfriend has his son, the other has grown to tolerate his behavior. I\u2019m fully aware three is a crazy age. He is very loud, runs everywhere, throws everything, but the thing I do not like is how he doesn\u2019t respect the dogs\u2019 boundaries. He shoves them out of his way, pulls on them etc. At my house, I have a 9 year old dog who hasn\u2019t really been around kids. She was fine at first, hesitant but would lick him and try to play. She now is very on edge when he is here. He will randomly charge at her, pull her tail, and yell at her to do things. All of this stresses her out and has gotten to the point where she has almost nipped him several times, but only when literally cornered by him. I have been very vocal about my concern for both their safety, as I want to make this work for all parties. When I have brought it up to my boyfriend, including offering some things we can try to help teach him personal space, boundaries, listening better, he has made comments like I\u2019m attacking his parenting, I\u2019m not his mom, etc. he melts down anytime someone tells him to stop doing something, will start throwing things at me and/or my dog, but there are never any consequences. I finally said it\u2019s too stressful on me and my dog to have his son here, and I don\u2019t think putting her up everytime he comes over is a good long term solution. I said if I am not really allowed an opinion on the topic that until he can learn to listen better and respect others personal space I don\u2019t feel comfortable having his son over. His response was maybe we can just try again later, but I feel like unless he/we start actually implementing some changes around his behavior nothing will change. It seems like because I\u2019m not a parent I don\u2019t know anything, I feel like not allowing him over is extreme but I\u2019m out of ideas on how to keep his son and my dog safe if nothing changes.", "created_utc": 1684706720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o7u4x/aita_for_not_currently_allowing_my_boyfriends/", "score": 478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
