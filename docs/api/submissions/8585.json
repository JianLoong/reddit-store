My bestie is socially awkward and has a lot of confidence issue due to his past trauma. He moved out soon as he turned 18 because his parents constantly told that he was unwanted. Due to all this he had a very hard time dating. My boyfriend knows about it as well (This information will be relevant later). \n\n\nYesterday it was my bestie's birthday. Since he doesn't have friends he asked me and my boyfriend to invite our friends. About an hour into the party one of his friends asked her boyfriend out to marry her. It was adorable my boyfriend was happy but my bestie looked visibility upset. He started walking towards his room without saying anything, my boyfriend noticed asked him what he was upto and he said he wasn't feeling well. My boyfriend looked at him and said \"I know you are sad because you would never be able to experience something like this\". My bestie started ran to his room and closed the door. I was livid, I called off the party and kicked my boyfriend out. \n\nI went back to my bestie's room and somehow convinced him to open the door. He sobbing and told everyone's life would be better if he wasn't born and told he was unwanted and would never be loved. I felt like a terrible friend, he had been there with me when everyone left me and I had no clue about how he felt. I decided to stay with friend until he is alright. I was scared that he might do something wrong if I didn't stay with him. \n\nSo I called my boyfriend and told him about my friend, he was obviously mad at me for kicking him and told me that he is not a kid could take care of himself, I refused and hung up. He has been blowing up my phone and telling me to return, I am just ignoring his message. As for my bestie, I finally stopped crying and is sleeping rn. \n\nI feel like a terrible friend for not having a clue about my bestie's mental health and also a terrible gf because of upsetting my boyfriend. \n\nReddit AITA?\n\n\nThank y'all for your response. I would like to answer a few questions. \n\n1)My boyfriend didn't say that he \"thinks\" about not being to experience something like this. He said \"you won't experience something like that\"\n\n2) We have been bestie's but we live 2 states apart and my current boyfriend doesn't like me inviting my guy friends so neither did I invite him to my place neither I went to stay at his. \n\n3) He has agreed to do therapy and we are going to a therapist tomorrow. \n\n4) As for why he doesn't have friends,well he is very socially awkward and gets really anxious around people. \n\nAlso I am going to my boyfriend to confront him about all this mess, he needs to apologize to my bestie or we are done. I love him but I won't tolerate it this time. \n\n\nI will try to update y'all as soon as I can.", "created_utc": 1674992471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o5su0/aita_for_kicking_out_my_boyfriend_and_staying/", "score": 365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
