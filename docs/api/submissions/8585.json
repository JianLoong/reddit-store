My bestie is socially awkward and has a lot of confidence issue due to his past trauma. He moved out soon as he turned 18 because his parents constantly told that he was unwanted. Due to all this he had a very hard time dating. My boyfriend knows about it as well (This information will be relevant later). \n\n\nYesterday it was my bestie's birthday. Since he doesn't have friends he asked me and my boyfriend to invite our friends. About an hour into the party one of his friends asked her boyfriend out to marry her. It was adorable my boyfriend was happy but my bestie looked visibility upset. He started walking towards his room without saying anything, my boyfriend noticed asked him what he was upto and he said he wasn't feeling well. My boyfriend looked at him and said \"I know you are sad because you would never be able to experience something like this\". My bestie started ran to his room and closed the door. I was livid, I called off the party and kicked my boyfriend out. \n\nI went back to my bestie's room and somehow convinced him to open the door. He sobbing and told everyone's life would be better if he wasn't born and told he was unwanted and would never be loved. I felt like a terrible friend, he had been there with me when everyone left me and I had no clue about how he felt. I decided to stay with friend until he is alright. I was scared that he might do something wrong if I didn't stay with him. \n\nSo I called my boyfriend and told him about my friend, he was obviously mad at me for kicking him and told me that he is not a kid could take care of himself, I refused and hung up. He has been blowing up my phone and telling me to return, I am just ignoring his message. As for my bestie, I finally stopped crying and is sleeping rn. \n\nI feel like a terrible friend for not having a clue about my bestie's mental health and also a terrible gf because of upsetting my boyfriend. \n\nReddit AITA?\n\n\nThank y'all for your response. I would like to answer a few questions. \n\n1)My boyfriend didn't say that he \"thinks\" about not being to experience something like this. He said \"you won't experience something like that\"\n\n2) We have been bestie's but we live 2 states apart and my current boyfriend doesn't like me inviting my guy friends so neither did I invite him to my place neither I went to stay at his. \n\n3) He has agreed to do therapy and we are going to a therapist tomorrow. \n\n4) As for why he doesn't have friends,well he is very socially awkward and gets really anxious around people. \n\nAlso I am going to my boyfriend to confront him about all this mess, he needs to apologize to my bestie or we are done. I love him but I won't tolerate it this time. \n\n\nI will try to update y'all as soon as I can.\n\n#update:\n\nI got in contact with the girl and she told me that my boyfriend suggested this idea to her. He also told her that my bestie allowed her to do something like that at his birthday party.\n\nI was boiling and went to confront my boyfriend right after. We had a huge fight and he finally admitted that it was his plan. He accused me of trying to sleep with my bestie. I was shocked. Like, I literally stopped meeting my guy friends because he didn't want me to, he was the love of my life, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. \n\nI broke up with him on the spot. I am currently writing this in my car and I just can't stop crying, I thought he loved and trusted me. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like my life has been a lie.", "created_utc": 1674992471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o5su0/aita_for_kicking_out_my_boyfriend_and_staying/", "score": 853, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has he been pining unhealthily for OP for years while she uses him as some emotional crutch?  my (32F) cousin has a guy she\u2019s been doing that to for 10+ years, the guy is clearly in love but permanently friend zoned and it\u2019s the weirdest grossest dynamic that results in public drama like this sometimes.   \n\n\nAnd I\u2019m totally cool with introverts who have few friends, but who of those type of people who do not have major issues literally order up a big party for their birthday full of people they aren\u2019t friends with \u201cprovided\u201d by their one friend, OP? Either OP is TA for forcing a big party on him full of people he didn\u2019t know or weren\u2019t friends with, and some of those guests acted weird, or he was looking for drama by wanting her to supply this cast of partiers and then got emotional over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to what OP\u2019s bf said, again who knows.  It may have totally been an equal to the rest of the situation weird and over dramatic comment. But he may also have been getting tired of what could be an emotional affair between OP and bestie for a while now and this whole thing was sort of the last straw. Or as the poster above said, he could have been completely misunderstood.", ">\"Since he doesn't have friends he asked me and my boyfriend to invite our friends.\"\n\nThis was OP and her bf hosting at his home, not him hosting.", "NTA.  The real AH here is the woman who proposed at someone else\u2019s party.  If your bf meant what he said, then he\u2019s an AH too.", "The bestie shouldn\u2019t have suggested a party with other peoples friends in the first place as it\u2019s only ever going to reiterate that he doesn\u2019t have many. A meal out or similar would have worked better.", "ESH; this sounds like a lot of badly written teen drama and everyone needs a lot of therapy.", "NTA but why would you want to stay with your bf after saying something so disgusting to your best friend?", "What socially castrated person would think it wise to propose to somebody during the birthday party for somebody else, without even asking the permission of that 3rd person, the actual main person of that occasion?\n\n\nNta", "If you were wondering no, this did not happen", "NTA but why would someone hijack your bestie\u2019s birthday party to propose? That\u2019s incredibly rude. \n\nINFO: Was it your boyfriends friends who did it? Did your boyfriend know ahead of time that they would be proposing at your bestie\u2019s party?", " NTA, but your bf sure is.  What a horribly cruel and condescending thing for him to say, unprovoked.  \n\nI think you have gained a valuable piece of information about the character of the man you are dating.  He is a cruel person.

I'm calling fake on this post just for that.", "NTA", "NTA but the couple who did the proposal at bestie's birthday party. They were too cheap to pay for their own proposal/party and usurped someone else's arty, food, drinks, etc. I HATE people like that.", "NTA, OP! You helped a friend in a time of need and rightfully got angry and the one responsible. \n\nThat aside, a few things you\u2019ve said here lead me to believe that you should seriously reconsider whether you want to continue dating this guy. Frankly, he sounds insufferable.\n\nA partner that not only doesn\u2019t let you invite your own friends over male or not, but also completely insults them at their own BD party clearly has some of their own issues that they need to work out before they get into a long-term relationship. \n\nRemember OP, never push away your friends (especially ones you\u2019ve known for a long time) away for a partner, you\u2019ll regret it eventually! If your partner can\u2019t make the effort to get along with your friends, it\u2019s not gonna be a relationship you enjoy being a part of in the long run.", "The peculiar thing here is that some ass proposed in the middle of this party.  It wasn't a friend of the boy whose birthday it was, because he has no friends.  Jacking the occasion for this proposal was as much an asshole move as it was weird.\n\nOP's boyfriend is an obvious asshole for his comment, but OP isn't blameless for bringing in people like that in the first place and for not letting the party get hijacked.  OP thought it was \"adorable\" but given the time, place, and occasion it was deplorable.  Worst of all, it hurt her friend that she was trying to help by throwing the party.\n\nESH except the birthday boy:  the engaged couple, OP and her boyfriend.", "Sounds like bf doesn\u2019t like the friend. So I wonder if it was a real proposal or just did it to mess with the friend.

Careful, those insecurities usually come from somewhere", "NTA, your bestie basically has only you, but like other people he yearns for more, he is scared that he will be totally alone, not that he expects you to bail, but things happen.

I think it\u2019s best for your safety. This is how a lot of abusive relationships start. He was isolating you. First it\u2019s your guy friends, then your girl friends, then parents and relatives. Soon your alone with no escape route and he can pretty much do what he wants to you. \n\nBut he tipped his hand too early by pulling this cruel stunt and you escaped.", ">Like, I literally stopped meeting my guy friends because he didn't want me to, \n\nYeah, that was not smart of you. It was a raging red flag that you didn't even recognise as such. It's concerning that you thought it was totally normal and ok.\n\nNote for the future: it isn't.", "YTA to yourself for blaming yourself for not seeing your best friend\u2019s declining behavior. It is not your fault. Your friend is very ill. Stop blaming other people for his bad reactions. He is going to have poor reactions no matter what until he gets the help he needs. Also, if you are afraid he is going to hurt himself, then you need to a) consider if he is manipulating you into dropping everything for him and/or b) call whatever authorities necessary to help. It should not be on you alone to help him or stop him.", "ESH but also: \n\nInfo needed: have you ever dated the guy? Do your boyfriend and you live together or was this at your house? Who agreed to the therapy?\n\nHonestly this seems very contrived. I was skeptical but on board until you state your friend(or boyfriend?) agreed to couples therapy and you were able to get an appointment the next day. No way. If it\u2019s possible in your area, let me know where so I can move. \n\nAlso your extremely socially awkward, to the point of having zero friends, suggested you host a party with strangers? I don\u2019t think so. If that\u2019s true and you went along with it instead of suggesting a quiet night in/meal out - YTA for putting him in that position. Not nearly as big of an AH as your boyfriend, but still. \n\nThis strike me as a post written by a 13 year old, imagining what nearly 30 year olds are like. I can\u2019t imagine a bunch of nearly 30s folks behaving like this or calling someone your \u201cbestie\u201d at 26. \n\nLastly, does bestie have a habit of breaking down and saying it would be better if he was never born? That\u2019s emotionally manipulative behavior if it\u2019s repetitive. \n\nI know I sound callous, but I have spent *a lot* of my life visiting multiple relatives in mental hospitals, supporting them, handling genuine s*uicide attempts, cry-for-help attempts (a very real and sad thing), attending support groups for relatives of people with mental illness, etc. At best, none of thing rings true and strikes me as a soap opera. At worst\u2026 every single person involved needs to get a reality check.\n\nI know I sound callous. I\u2019ll take the downvotes. OP is not terribly at fault if true, except for knowing full well bestie has social anxiety and having a full party of their own friends where bestie knows know one. Again, I find it hard to believe bestie requested that but hey, maybe.\n\n\nEdited to say: could be a language barrier problem that\u2019s making this seem very unbelievable to me. OP is from India based on post history?\n\nAlso OP- is this the same Bf who threw you a party when you came out to him?", "Turns out OP updated her ex-boyfriend suggested the idea to the friend & told her OP\u2019s bestie would allow it at his party.  Not surprised Satan orchestrated  this. He further accused OP of wanting to sleep with her bestie.
