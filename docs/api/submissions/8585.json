My bestie is socially awkward and has a lot of confidence issue due to his past trauma. He moved out soon as he turned 18 because his parents constantly told that he was unwanted. Due to all this he had a very hard time dating. My boyfriend knows about it as well (This information will be relevant later). \n\n\nYesterday it was my bestie's birthday. Since he doesn't have friends he asked me and my boyfriend to invite our friends. About an hour into the party one of his friends asked her boyfriend out to marry her. It was adorable my boyfriend was happy but my bestie looked visibility upset. He started walking towards his room without saying anything, my boyfriend noticed asked him what he was upto and he said he wasn't feeling well. My boyfriend looked at him and said \"I know you are sad because you would never be able to experience something like this\". My bestie started ran to his room and closed the door. I was livid, I called off the party and kicked my boyfriend out. \n\nI went back to my bestie's room and somehow convinced him to open the door. He sobbing and told everyone's life would be better if he wasn't born and told he was unwanted and would never be loved. I felt like a terrible friend, he had been there with me when everyone left me and I had no clue about how he felt. I decided to stay with friend until he is alright. I was scared that he might do something wrong if I didn't stay with him. \n\nSo I called my boyfriend and told him about my friend, he was obviously mad at me for kicking him and told me that he is not a kid could take care of himself, I refused and hung up. He has been blowing up my phone and telling me to return, I am just ignoring his message. As for my bestie, I finally stopped crying and is sleeping rn. \n\nI feel like a terrible friend for not having a clue about my bestie's mental health and also a terrible gf because of upsetting my boyfriend. \n\nReddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1674992471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o5su0/aita_for_kicking_out_my_boyfriend_and_staying/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should have thrown their own party.", "NTA - Your boyfriend on the other hand - put him in the bin. What a horrible thing to say to someone.

Your bf said something hurtful and in that moment, your bestie needed your support.

He got mad that you kicked him out, but had **zero** regrets for **INTENTIONALLY** hurting your bestie's feelings.  Even people I know who are on the autism spectrum, such as myself, would feel horrible if we unintentionally hurt someone's feelings that badly.\n\nYour boyfriend just doubled-down on his DGAF about anyone else's feelings.\n\nIf possible, I recommend your bestie take therapy as well.

Does not mean I can't watch someone propose in front of me, heck, it wasn't that long ago that my friends got married and I was there  the whole time. This goes beyond just confidence, and way in to trauma.", "Being happy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he was asked. It\u2019s his friends getting engaged, who wouldn\u2019t.
