High functioning, in the regular classroom and always has been, but has a need for physical comfort and has always wanted lots of hugs from friends and adults.  She's socially included by peers and not bullied or anything like that, just with a high physical comfort need.\n\nEver since my daughter was a newborn she's wanted skin-to-skin contact.  It comforts her and when she's down or had a hard day, she likes to lay on my chest with both our shirts off and share our body heat and breath together.  Often when she has a really hard day she'll ask for it and I'll take off my shift and so will see and she'll lay on me and whimper a little with her face on my chest.\n\nRecently, within the past 3 months, she's started developing.  It's crazy because she went from \"hasn't started puberty\" to \"we probably should start making her wear a bra\" in that time.  Like 0-to-60 puberty style. \n\nSo recently she had a really hard day and wanted to lay on me, and I told her yes, but I think she needs to keep her shirt on from now on because she's getting older and she had a pretty big break down and cry.  I gave in and said I was sorry, let her have her connection time, but told her that since she was growing up we would have to find new ways for love and comfort. \n\nWhen my wife got home our daughter cried to her that I was telling her that we were going to have to stop.  My wife comforted her and said she'd \"talk to me\" (which is pretty emasculating) as a way to comfort her. \n\nAfter our daughter was in bed and asleep my wife was pretty livid, saying I can't make changes like that without talking with her first and that it wasn't the right way to treat our daughter.  That I need to apologize to her and let her know that we can keep having comfort time until she wants to stop because we love her and accept her as she is and that it's important we show her that.  I told her that I thought she'd appreciate I was trying to establish boundaries now that our girl is suddenly not a little girl anymore, and she said **I** was being weird for being suddenly uncomfortable with it even though all I was doing was recognizing the situation of her getting older! \n\nNow I'm in the guest room tonight because my wife and I are both fuming at each other. \n\nSo am I the asshole here?\n\n\n----\n\nEdit: \n\nI need to head to bed, but I wanted to thank everyone for the replies.

The need for her should be soothed within the family members' boundaries.  When she's not in the middle of needing soothing, she can help brainstorm other ways that she can expect to be soothed.  She is capable of doing this.", "NTA. \n\nIt's even more important with autistic kids to set healthy and appropriate boundaries. I would say you can still cuddle etc but wearing clothes. Obviously empathise and acknowledge it's a difficult transition but explain as much as able about appropriate/safe behaviours. We've just had a similar transition (at eight) with our daughter who is also autistic. We have had a lot of long conversations about consent and appropriate boundaries and developing bodies etc.\n\nI am very probably also on the spectrum (consensus of my doctor and OT but I can't afford assessment) and was a victim of CSA and multiple SA growing up because I didn't understand boundaries and how to keep my body safe. A lot of my female DX autie friends have also had many of these experiences. As a result of this we are extremely candid with our kids. We actually had an incident recently with a older male child trying to talk my eldest into inappropriate behaviour and thankfully due to the open communication she was able to hear the warning bells and come straight to me. I remember as a kid knowing some things felt off but not being able to articulate or identify precisely what that was.\n\nI would explain very well why you're moving away from that kind of contact. Imo direct and more 'adult' style explanations are more helpful for autistic brains to process. Have a think about what to say and obviously chat to your wife too but yeah... I'd say a few big chats and a transition period is necessary. Kids around her are gonna be going through puberty too and understand boundaries and how to keep her body safe is really important at this age!", "NTA. I'm an autistic ADHD adult. I was was the naked kid who developed really early. My dad set this boundary way earlier than 10... About 6-7 if memory serves. I found a weighted blanket gives me a similar experience.

You are allowed to have boundaries. You are allowed to be uncomfortable with this. Loving your daughter does not mean running roughshod over your own limits. Your daughter will benefit just as much from coming to understand your right to feel comfortable and be respected as she will from skin-to-skin, it will just take longer to pay off.\n\nAlso, I would be *very* concerned about any outside adult learning that your blossoming daughter is lying on you topless. That could get you a very legitimate CPS investigation and from everything I've ever heard, once they start they don't stop easily. \n\nCould your wife find a bralette for your daughter to wear during skin-to-skin? It leaves much more skin than a t-shirt does, but keeps her breasts covered. \n\nAnd, before I hear about it, yes breasts are for much more than sexualization. I actually bring this up semi frequently in my home. But having your young daughters' breasts- once they have developed to even possibly needing a bra - pressed against a parent's bare chest could cause real issues and is a no for me.", "oh boy, if she ever talks about that within earshot of a mandatory reporter y\u2019all are gonna get a visit from CPS with the quickness.

In normal circumstances of *course* you wouldn't want to go around hugging your shirtless pubescent daughter.\n\nBut this isn't exactly \"normal.\" \n\nEssentially, she's being punished for starting puberty, and that's really not fair to her. Again - your comfort is being violated here, not hers.

I have no answers for you there.\n\nOne possible compromise for now is what I've done for \"skin-time\" w/my at the time boyfriend, now husband.

You are capable of communicating with your daughter without your wife being present. And your daughter is capable of understanding appropriate boundaries within your family.

That said, as someone who's married to a mildly autistic woman, I would highly recommend that you also work with her to find other substitutes for bare chest to bare chest contact to help her self soothe. Not just because it makes you feel weird but also so that she has some tools to self cope independently when she becomes an adult or if she's away from you for any extended period of time (such as on vacation with a friend). Maybe find a material that she finds comforting and buy her something in the material (blanket, stuffed animal, pillow, etc). My wife has a pillow that's she's slept with since she was a little girl.

But there\u2019s a social rule you need to dive into and explore to decide what you will do.\n\nIt\u2019s anecdotal, but I often noticed that kids with developmental disabilities or neurodivergence seem to develop earlier and faster. So she has the triple whammy of boobs, younger than most, and difficulty with social cues and appropriateness. \n\nI would suggest a compromise. She needs some kind of boob-covering top. Since she\u2019s autistic, she\u2019ll likely hate normal bras, so look into bralettes, sports bras, or even very short crop tops. Heck, you can just cut off a T-shirt she already owns.\n\nShe can have the skin-to-skin with her stomach and sternum. \n\nExplain to your wife that this is partially about guiding your daughter on understanding how to interact with her growing body and boundaries between men and women. And a misunderstood or garbled account of skin-to-skin snuggles can result in a CPS call. \n\nGo talk to your daughter, and explain as bluntly as possible. \u201cYou are growing breasts. Putting your breasts directly on someone is something we do with people we date, or marry. Not friends or family. This is one of the those \u201csocial rules\u201d that no one says out loud but we understand. That\u2019s why I said no more direct skin-to-skin.\n\n\u201cYou remember how we talked about [rule] and [rule]? This is another one that\u2019s very important to people. Remember how I explained that when you do X, people think you\u2019re trying to hurt or upset people? Well, when grown-up men want young women and girls to put their breasts directly on them, those men are usually trying to do something inappropriate.\n\n\u201cWhen people say they\u2019re not comfortable with something, it\u2019s okay to be sad or hurt, or even cry. When I said I didn\u2019t want your breasts on me, it was okay for you to be sad. But you understood that it was my boundary, and respected that. You are a wonderful little girl and you have not done anything wrong. \n\n\u201cSo, because you want to snuggle with Dad, and Dad does like snuggling, I\u2019m going to ask you to cover just your breasts. You can do that with a bra, a swimsuit top, or a short shirt. We\u2019ll go get a daddy-snuggling top, just for us!\u201d", "I'm going yta for the unilateral decision.

You have a neurodiverse child who has a routine for soothing herself that is dependent on skin to skin contact with you. I totally support you wanting to change that, but you should have discussed it with your wife first & agreed on how to best broach this change with your daughter. Hopefully this was a kneejerk reaction & when you've both calmed down she'll see that you just giving in on this until your daughter is ready to stop is unreasonable.

These are both completely valid and not mutually exclusive.\n\nIf I might gently offer some advice, perhaps the approach to setting this boundary was not ideal. If you want to establish a new way of using this comfort, it is probably better to talk to your daughter in advance about it, before she needs it. By the time she asks for it she is already dysregulated and will not be able to absorb these changes. If you discuss ahead of time, maybe use social stories, and show her/ practice different ways of getting comfort, then she won\u2019t be blindsided in a moment where she\u2019s heading for a meltdown.

(I haven\u2019t read all of them so apologies if this has already been pointed out)\n\nThis is going to be a hard boundary to set and she is going to feel sad confused and disappointed. That is all true and it is all worth it. When I (31F) was little my mom used to give me back rubs/tickles and I would strip down naked and lay on her lap. There was nothing weird or wrong with it in any way but of course as kids do, I got older. I loved my back rubs and whined and cried when she started saying I was too old to get them like that anymore (I liked my booty scratches, sue me) so she regularly caved and honestly probably should have stopped when I was way younger. The reason any of this matters is yes, I was sad when things had to change but later on in life when I started really becoming an individual and looking back at my experiences, I recognized that this was a weird thing and it made me feel retroactively uncomfortable. I want to repeat and make it clear that there was absolutely nothing creepy about it in reality but I can\u2019t help but feel a little weird about it even to this day. That would make my mom super sad to know so it isn\u2019t something I have ever brought up (bc again, she didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong) but if I could go back in time, I would have rather she ended it earlier. Don\u2019t set your daughter up to potentially resent you for something that is innocent", "YTA. It\u2019s just breasts. You didn\u2019t prepare her for this at all.", "NTA.  It probably would have been a better idea to discuss changes with the attire you and your daughter wear during soothing before discussing it with your daughter so that both parents could be on the same page.  That said, even as a parent you have a right to have reasonable boundaries just like your wife and daughter do.  Hopefully she was just caught off guard by your daughter coming to her when she got home and the two of you will be able to have a real discussion about the situation once the two of you are not fuming anymore.\n\nI can't guarantee this is the case but I'd also like to suggest that both you and your wife might be responding to this situation differently because of how significantly differently society will treat men and women and each of you only have first hand experience with one or the other.  As a male you know that society is really messed up with how it sees and treats male motivation.  To society, everything a male does is likely sexual and should be considered sexual unless it can be proven otherwise.  It is quite a distinct possibility that one misplaced statement from your daughter or wife (or even you) could have social services, neighbors, friends and family or even strangers descend into your families lives and cause serious trauma in a misguided attempt to do what is best for your daughter.  And once that toothpaste is out of the tube it's out forever.  Even if everything is cleared up damage will have been done and plenty of people will be on heightened alert to swoop in again and repeat the trauma over more.  Plus, your daughter herself might end up finding this form of soothing troubling in the future; teenage or adult daughter could easily decide this scenario was inappropriate and be troubled that you and your wife allowed it, forgetting over time how her 10 year old self felt.\n\n(And before anyone gets angry,  let me make myself clear: Abuse is not ok and should be dealt with right away.  Being vigilant about abuse is incredibly important.  What I am saying is that treating innocent things as inappropriate has consequences as well for everyone involved.)\n\nYour wife, on the other hand, likely may not have ever experienced anything like that herself.  Society sees women as being almost completely uninterested sexually.  Even overtly sexual motivations are seen as not sexual or at least expected to be.  She has likely been expected to do things or behave in certain ways in her life that were not ok but that society says is fine because women are just seen as naturally maternal and that \"feminine\" and \"maternal\" nature makes it all fine.  Your wife might also be seeing another phenomenon much more directly related to the current scenario for her.  Society imposes quite significantly higher levels of sexualization on women's bodies compared to men's.  While most boys your daughters age are likely still seen as little boys, your daughter is already starting to experience people seeing her body as adult.  Suddenly the world will go from ignoring her as a child to seeing her in a sexual light as a woman in giant leaps while the corresponding mental changes will be much slower.  She knows whats coming for your daughter as she likely experienced it herself in one way or another.  Even though your choice was well intentioned it's just one of the first dominoes to fall in your daughters life.\n\nIn the end both of you need to work together to  help your daughter but that is going to likely take calm attitudes and some degree of mutual understanding.", "Also YTA for saying she should wear a bra", "I don't have a judgement, I'm just curious why the puberty age is getting earlier and earlier. I got my first period at 14 and didn't develop breasts until 19. I didn't know a single girl/afab in elementary school who has started puberty. Not one. But these days, or seems like most kids are starting their periods at REALLY early ages. It seems cruel for them to lose out on those carefree childhood years.", "NTA.

Your daughter is going to have to adapt to different comforting techniques because when she's an adult and dating or has a bad day out in the real world, she can't just come home and stick her bare adult body on her father.

I have a smaller chest and wear loose fitting tank tops (specifically mens undershirts, not anything with spaghetti straps) as a \"base layer\" generally no one can tell that I don't wear a bra.", "Friend, society sexualizes girls before middle school. Bra or no bra will *not* stop society or individuals from sexualizing your child. There is no tool, no article of clothing that will prevent that. The only way to fight it is to fight patriarchy.", "That's fine. My 2.5 year old son, who was breastfed until about 1 year, will randomly try to grab my boobs sometimes and I push his hands away and tell him no.\n\nI think it's because him and his dad don't have boobs, so it's a different weird thing to him. But I don't want him thinking it's okay to grab boobs, so I push his hands away. I've had friends' kids also try to grab boobs and I reacted the same way.", "That\u2019s intense! Yeah I wouldn\u2019t affirm that behavior at all", "He is still putting his kid first. But putting her first doesn\u2019t mean just doing what she wants.", "I hate \u2018normal\u2019 fitted bras with a vengeance but have found the ones that look a little like sports bras are a much better fit. They\u2019re not as tight as a sports bra, but still give a level of support without the discomfort of a standard bra. \n\nI just had to get over the fact that they always seem to be in the \u2018old ladies\u2019 section (which I am getting older but not there just yet!). Which is mad as I think so many people would benefit from them and they could make them look so much prettier than the plain utilitarian ones you see right now.", "A t-shirt bra is just a molded cup bra, usually made with preformed foam cups. OP's daughter may not even have quite enough to fill out actual cups. It's just a really awkwardly specific comment. She doesn't necessarily need an actual bra. A sports bra or bralette will work fine.", "Same btw \n\nIt is funny in an awkward way to me. But I totally react at being touched", "My 2 year old daughter went and grabbed at my boobs, got my nipple, and twisted the other week. She got set aside because that shit hurt. She did not appreciate it.", "Also, if anyone has a larger cup size and is struggling to find bralettes with enough boob-room, DM me. I recently found both black and white (and even PRETTY) bralettes for cheap as chips, and they are wonderful. I'm a 34G-ish at present and can't wear regular bras, especially underwired, due to scar tissue adhesions around my ribcage. But these are so comfy I almost forget I'm wearing them, and have plenty of room for the giant titties.", "You\u2019re an asshole. \n\nAnd an absolutely perfect parent, I\u2019m sure."]}
