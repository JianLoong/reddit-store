They introduced themselves and seemed friendly. A day or 2 later they asked if they could use our wifi until they could get internet installed in a few days as that was the soonest appointment. I said sure and gave them the wifi password. \n\nI don't think much of it until a few weeks later when my Internet is running slow so I log into my router and see a ton of devices connected. Phones, laptops, iPads, a couple of TVs and some gaming consoles. \n\nI realize they never stopped using my wifi and have now connected a boatload of devices and are using up most of my bandwidth. \n\nSo I just changed the Wi-Fi password. Like 10 minutes later there is a knock on my door. It's my upstairs neighbor asking me if my Internet is working saying theirs is down and they are wondering if there is an outage. I tell them \"nope my Internet is working great right now. You might want to call your service provider.\"  \n\nThey then ask if they could use my wifi until theirs gets fixed. I responded with \"sorry I am actually close to my data cap for the month and I don't want to have to pay for any overages so I better not add any devices.\" I can tell they look pissed when they leave. \n\nI text the neighbor nextdoor to me who I am friendly with and tell them about how the upstairs people were mooching Internet. He texted me an hour later telling me how they had come to him asking to borrow his wifi password until their Internet could be fixed and that he politely declined. He also texted the only other apartment that would be in wifi range and told them. Sure enough they tried to mooch that wifi as well. \n\nThe next day I see a Comcast van in the parking lot. I keep an eye out for the worker and I see him working on the ped that feeds our building. I walk out and ask in a concerned voice. \"Oh no, is there a problem in the area cause I need my Internet\" \n\nHe responds by telling me that he is just there to do a new installation so no worries. I go back in my apartment and see him proceed to go to the moochers place upstairs.\n\nTl;Dr is that some people are assholes just trying to take advantage of others.", "NTA. Did they at least offer to paying for the rides you did give?", "NTA. Just because they are neighbors does not mean they are friends. Stop inviting them over.", "NTA- They are just upset that they can't selfishly take advantage of you anymore.", "Nta there's no reason for you to feel bad. They  try to take advantage of you guys. They knew this was a temporary thing. Her husband wasn't working overnights after the week was up. \n\nHe could have continued to pick her up after the 1st week was up. If there their upset then that's on them. You and your wife did nothing wrong.\n\nRemember how his wife gets home is not your responsibility and it was only a temporary favor. If there no longer friendly to you guys then so be it. Stop inviting them to stuff and enjoy your BBQs and other events that you host without them.", "NTA. Not a free taxi service.", "NTA, what they did was take advantage of your kindess it had well extended into almost 2 weeks and they are mad because you couldnt do it one day.  The Nerve", "NTA. You didn't not give her rides, you didn't give her one single ride and these people are already acting entitled. They're the only AHS I see in this picture.", "INFO: What did they say when you asked them about it", "NTA and they might just have a lot going on right now. You might be reading into their behaviour."]}
