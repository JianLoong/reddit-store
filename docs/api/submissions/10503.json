It's not appropriate to treat pregnant women like typhoid mary. That creates a hostile work environment for them and their babies.

And email allows you to process privately. You aren't entitled to find out before other people. So it's an AH move to call her out for that. \n\n\nThe big question is how much of you avoiding her affected work? Sitting in a different seat at a meeting? Whatever. Refusing to talk to her about a work related issue? Not okay. And it sounds like you never even gave her the opportunity to be anywhere near you, likely some of that was work related. I'm leaning towards YTA, but it could be ESH here if this actually did not affect your jobs at all and the \"discrimination\" is just not sitting near her, then reporting you is pretty excessive.", "YTA - It would be one thing if she was going out of her way to provoke you but it sounds like she\u2019s merely existing at work.

You have given enough for me to interpret that you are making a coworker feel very unwelcome and uncomfortable at work.  So much so, that she felt you were discriminating against her.  Sure, it's possible that she overreacted.  But reading between the lines of your post and your focus on your experience, your triggers, your mental health...it seems like her reaction didn't come out of nowhere.\n\nIf we were to swap out pregnancy for, say, cancer...how would it be if you were avoiding her?  Divorce?  If your coworker were to miscarry and you were to become pregnant again would it be ok for her to obviously avoid you?  Would you avoid her?  \n\nI feel for you.  Miscarriage can be devastating.  But other women can't stop being pregnant because of what you went through.  It sounds like you need to take a leave of absence to deal with what you are still processing.  It might feel like the world has stopped turning for you, but it hasn't for anyone else.

You asked for space and she said sure.  That means she doesn't go out of her way to interact with you, but she is still your coworker.  Your jobs are apparently close enough that you run into each other occasionally.

Should a parent who has lost a child expect people to keep their kids out of their field of view?

I have a feeling it doesn\u2019t make you any less aware of her and her pregnancy. So it seems a bit extreme, and I can see how that would be pretty easy to take personally.

If she'd announced it in a meeting, that's not private, but requesting every single person at this school come and tell you privately that they're pregnant before they're allowed to notify everybody else is ridiculous. There's putting your mental health first, and then there's expecting people to make unreasonable adjustments for your mental health.", "She is 8 months pregnant\u2026. she announced in October. It\u2019s incredibly obvious and she has flaunted it in many ways.", "I\u2019m torn as well. I can\u2019t imagine what OP is going through and seeing someone so happily pregnant. But for me it\u2019s the time this has gone on. I understand taking a couple weeks to process but if she announced her pregnancy in October and OP is still avoiding her 4 months later than I can see why the coworker feels upset. Although grief doesn\u2019t have an end date, that\u2019s too long to avoid someone at work.", "It was a general email to the whole staff, it\u2019s a WORK email, so personal updates aren\u2019t appropriate anyways.", "I\u2019d agree if it was a week or two but sounds like OPs been actively avoiding the coworker for 4 months since she announced in October. That\u2019s too long and over the top.", "How has OP\u2019s friend not given OP space?", "Thank you, I appreciate your comment, I never wanted to stop her from celebrating, I just wanted her to understand why I couldn\u2019t participate.", "How do you know this woman has no clue? She could have had miscarriages and not disclosed that to OP.", "This advice seems very unusual and unsustainable", "Your grieving shouldn\u2019t disturb or disrupt the workplace though\u2026.it\u2019s affecting the people around you more than I think you understand", "Relocating sounds like a good idea if you can when you\u2019re being triggered. However, relocating to another area of the same room where you can still see her just as easily? How does that make any difference?", "I think it was good that you asked, but it is not obligatory for her to follow with the petition. I am sorry for your loss and hope time will help you find energy and peace, and keep using your resources ! (i think the grief counselor made a great suggestion, but sometimes things just dont work).", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I hope you have the support you need.", "So sorry for your loss :(", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "She was your friend at work?", "That doesn't line up with your post where you specifically mention being in meetings with her.", "So she basically reported that you wouldn't have non-work conversations with her during free time? I feel like that's not something she can do, even if it were a protected class. \n\n\nBut you say you never see her, and in the OP you mentioned having to remove yourself from situations when she is there.", "YTA\n\nI know the grieving process isn\u2019t linear and it may take more time for you to grieve this. You aren\u2019t TA for acknowledging that you are grieving and pregnant people hits too close to home. You are TA for expecting the world to accommodate the situation since it has been 7 months, especially at work when someone is pregnant.\n\nSometimes grief makes you do weird things.. but it\u2019s really bizarre that you are controlling the situation to this extent.\n\nI think it would be good for you to take a leave of absence from work so you can give yourself breathing room.", "But do you get up as soon as she sits near you? If so, yes, that\u2019s obvious. Especially if it\u2019s every time. I\u2019d bet several coworkers have caught on.", "What text?", "Honestly. As a person who spent lots of thousands of dollars on IVF and failed and had a forced hysterectomy I understand your pain. \n\nBut you have to learn to cope with it. \n\nIt\u2019s not up to the rest of the world to hide their joy because of your pain. \n\nGet help. Grief counseling. Therapy. Meds. \n\nBut don\u2019t expect the world to change for you!", "Flaunted as in living her life? You are an asshole", "OP while I understand where your head space is\u2026 you need to take a step back. Describing her as \u201cFlaunting\u201d her pregnancy is a pretty clear indication you are centering yourself when you think about her choices. But it isn\u2019t about you. She\u2019s not thinking about rubbing it in your face when she wears a fitted maternity shirt, or is excited about her growing family. And it isn\u2019t her job to do so. And on in intellectual level, I know you know that. But you need to act on that, not raw emotions in the work place.", "I doubt her 8 month pregnant belly is being flaunted maliciously at you. \u2026not everything is about you.", "How has she \u201cflaunted\u201d her pregnancy?", "You said you asked to be told privately, not personally. Those are two different things. In your post the issue was about being told privately, not about the appropriateness of an email to the whole staff", "That's just how I viewed the explanation of her still being so close. Perhaps I should have said NAH but I'm not particularly used to this yet. But as always this is only one person's explanation of an event and I'm taking it at face value so I'll edit my previous judgement thank you", "You were in the wrong you can\u2019t push your trauma onto other people", "I totally get it. She may never understand, not unless she experiences this loss on her own (hopefully not). It\u2019s a lonely sadness to be living. I hope you have a strong support system to get you through this tough time. Two miscarriages within such a short time is really rough. Virtual hug. \u2764\ufe0f", "i agree it would have been better to take a leave of absence to process", "Yeah she was a friend, which was why she was one of a very small number of people who knew what I was going through. I never would\u2019ve said something to a coworker that wasn\u2019t a friend.", "Do you realize how many meetings teachers have? They can be a weekly to biweekly occurrence.", "Is she TA for expecting a friend to help accommodate her? Because OP and her were supposed to be friends.", "Nope, it was one time.", "The text I sent asking for space", "And she has a right to be excited about her pregnancy!", "Lots more staff wide emails with updates after admin clarified that personal updates need to stay out of work emails.", "Sorry that was confusing. I asked to be texted separately, she was a friend, which is the only reason any of this came about.", "That\u2019s not \u201cflaunting\u201d her pregnancy to you. She\u2019s not doing anything personally to you.", "That is not a fair request.", "That\u2019s not at all what you said in your post. You asked for private so you could process privately. Text versus email doesn\u2019t change that you were told in a method that does not involve other people", "What's the difference between an email and a text? You're making a big deal out of this and making her responsible, at least in your mind, for your grief because she didn't use the right mode of communication.", "All my other friends seem to think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable\u2026.. and they\u2019re incredibly supportive. And I\u2019ve had friends follow my request gladly.", "Id also like to add that OP is a teacher. The likely hood of anyone staring at her while checking her email is slim to none. Is the issue that you found out during school hours OP? Because the whole email vs text separately situation you take issue with really doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s essentially the same thing. You were not told in person or in a group setting, just because it was a chain email.  \n\nThat being said, soft YTA. Id imagine the grief you\u2019re dealing with is very difficult and being around somebody who is experiencing what you were hoping for has to be hard. But the reality of it is that the world can\u2019t stop for you. No one is directly trying to cause harm to you. I think it sucks if she genuinely was a coworker you considered a friend and you assumed you\u2019d be told separately, but you\u2019re taking it a bit far by avoiding her to this extent.", "She sent an email. You had time to process it, since it was *via email.* She did not owe you a private conversation in person. \n\nHow long are you going to ask people to tell you privately?", "So....Basically you wanted her to go out of her way to tell you first.....so you knew to ignore her?", "Few friends would tell you to your face that you\u2019re being unreasonable knowing that you\u2019re sad.\n\nBut hopefully you\u2019ll listen to the random strangers telling you that you are being unreasonable and apologize to the pregnant coworker.", "As long as it takes, I\u2019m in grief counseling for miscarriage and I\u2019m following the guidance I\u2019ve been given, which is to request friends tell me about pregnancies over text without expectations.", "Lol. Truth.", "Wow that is incredible main character energy", "Without expectations\u2026.what does that mean to you? Because it sounds like you 100% expected everyone to follow your rules. Perhaps you miscommunicated to her the same way you did in the post. If you said private, and not, personally texted, she may have thought she was following your rules. But also, she may have just forgotten since she\u2019s also a busy overworked teacher and pregnant - so she\u2019s got a lot of her own stuff going on", "I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s fair. Some friends may say sure. You cannot expect everyone to do so.", "Then I don\u2019t want to be friends with them? Like I would support my friends unconditionally and I expect the same in return."]}
