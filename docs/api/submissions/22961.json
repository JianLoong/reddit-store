And like the last two parties we as a couple had been invited to, she requested to leave about halfway through because she wasn\u2019t having fun. And on top of that, was complaining to people about how people overvalue sports and how they contribute nothing to modern society. People were obviously annoyed with this.\n\nShe got angry and said that even if she was going to have a bad time, it was extremely rude of my friends to not invite her. I then reminded her again of how she acted at previous parties, and said something along the lines of \u201cmaybe you would be invited if you weren\u2019t complaining the entire time\u201d.\n\nNow I realize that is kind of a insensitive thing to say, but it\u2019s true.
