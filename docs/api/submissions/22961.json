A couple weeks back I was invited to a party with my friends and their significant others. My friends, like me, are very into sports as are their significant others. So I planned on going, and told my wife that I had been invited to the event where we were going to be watching this sporting event, and it had a theme and such.\n\nMy wife then asked where her invitation was, and I told her that she would be miserable anyways. And like the last two parties we as a couple had been invited to, she requested to leave about halfway through because she wasn\u2019t having fun. And on top of that, was complaining to people about how people overvalue sports and how they contribute nothing to modern society. People were obviously annoyed with this.\n\nShe got angry and said that even if she was going to have a bad time, it was extremely rude of my friends to not invite her. I then reminded her again of how she acted at previous parties, and said something along the lines of \u201cmaybe you would be invited if you weren\u2019t complaining the entire time\u201d.\n\nNow I realize that is kind of a insensitive thing to say, but it\u2019s true. She then retorted with that when I hang with her friends, I don\u2019t contribute much to the conversation, and that her friends find it annoying I don\u2019t speak with them on topics they enjoy.\n\nThe argument basically came to a standstill there, and we\u2019ve been polite but frosty about it since.

Your wife was unbelievably rude to her hosts and other guests, so I understand why they don\u2019t want to include her. Did you talk to her about her bad and embarrassing behavior? However, it\u2019s a huge breach of etiquette to invite one spouse and not the other when all other significant others have been invited. In fact, it\u2019s a slap in the face. Again, I understand why, but your friends should have talked to you before excluding her. You are prioritizing your friends over your wife.\n\nEdited to change judgment.", "I don't think your an asshole. I think it was crappy of the host not to include your wife in the invitation and equally crappy that your wife behaves badly when she is invited. If she isn't going to enjoy herself, she should politely decline the invitations. If you feel the same way about  gatherings with her friends you should be able to decline the invite.

Yes, you unpacked it with her as you clarified in comments below.  Yes, they can decide not to invite her.   Yes, you can go to things without her.  However, if it's an outing where everyone is with their spouses and not you... That sounds like you ought to work on it with her and take a break from going until you work through this. The reason I was flipped from saying you're not the asshole is because your behavior towards her, her friends, and their interests- while not as bad as her's- doesn't model expectations.

There\u2019s a difference between staying thoughtfully quiet and loudly complaining the whole time. Your friends don\u2019t want to be around a sourpuss who bashes their hobbies and interests. And you shouldn\u2019t have to leave a party early because your wife is miserable. \n\nIf my husband was invited to a party based around something I didn\u2019t like, I probably wouldn\u2019t go because I would want to leave early too and that\u2019s not fair to him. \n\nYour wife needs some situational awareness and understanding. You both deserve to have your own interests and not be bashed for them, especially out loud with the people hosting the party within earshot. That\u2019s just crass.", "NTA", "NTA. She burned that bridge with your friends. No one invites the negative Nancy. Sports fans don't want to listen to someone bashing sports while watching them. \nHer friends have no reason to complain about you. You aren't into the subjects, which they know. You don't contribute, but you aren't complaining the entire time and asking to leave either.", "Not being invited was a very personal act against you.  A message\u2014a message that your hubby fully endorsed\u2014is that they don\u2019t want to be around you (at least for events like this).\n\nThe fact that dear hubby agrees with his friends\u2019 about this should worry you even more than having his friends not wanting to be around you.", "That missing invitation was her reminder that her bitching was noticed and she\u2019s created a problem for herself.", "Science burn!", "So true!", "Whoa - awesome", "And there\u2019s a big difference between sitting quietly and allowing others to have a convo that doesn\u2019t interest you and actively complaining about it.", "She herself said she wouldn\u2019t go, but just wanted the invitation. \n\nMakes zero sense to me.", "See you would think art would fall into that category, but it doesn\u2019t.\n\nShe just hates sports lol.", "Yeah you\u2019re telling me. It\u2019s embarrassing when she does stuff like this at events.", "I guess I can understand this.\n\nI agree it\u2019s a breach of etiquette, but I feel that once you\u2019ve been rude more than once, people\u2019s patience really wears thin. \n\nAnd I personally only see my friends maybe once every month or so, since most of them live in a different city about an hour and a half away. It\u2019s nice to be able to see them for a little bit, and to not have to leave early in the middle of an event because my wife doesn\u2019t think sports provide any value to society.", "I don\u2019t mind going with her to hang with her friends when I\u2019m invited. Her friends are from her work, so they naturally will talk about their very specific field which I know literally nothing about, and that\u2019s ok!\n\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t say much, but I try to ask questions when I can.\n\nAs for the invitation, I guess I can see that. I\u2019ll reach out to the host and tell him next time to invite us both just so it doesn\u2019t turn into a pissing match. Although after this I can see my wife wanting to go to talk more shit which is going to be a whole separate issue.", "Also, we\u2019ve all been to events we don\u2019t care for\u2026.. just act decent, like a grown ass adult.  Not petulant teenager being \u201cforced\u201d to do something they find boring.", "The reason other SOs are invited is because they enjoy sports as well. My wife is really the only one of the group that doesn\u2019t like sports, so it really makes it tough.\n\nI\u2019ve explained in other comments, but I\u2019m mostly quiet with my wife\u2019s friends as they are mostly from her work, and naturally their conversations drift to their very specific field of study. I will ask questions but can\u2019t contribute to the conversation most of the time lol.", "This is surprisingly allowed. My ex-fiance had a lot of issues, but one of them was not her hobby of going out to different things I didn't enjoy as much while I hung around and watched our kids.", "I did yes. \n\nShe herself said she wouldn\u2019t want to go, but that she should have been invited regardless.", "You must be pretty young if you're going to assume you have to share every moment of your life with a partner, kid. And I'm saying this as a 30 yo, so if you're somehow my age or older than you're just immature. The only rule between partners is what the partners themselves agree on and what their boundaries are.  \n\n\nIn this case, she massively overstepped with the assumptions that she would keep being invited to a party while being hostile, or that her husband would support her hostility.   \n\n\nBeing a partner is about supporting the BEST of someone, not supporting everything, including their bad habits, their fallacies and their faults.", "We had the conversation at home after I had got the invitation. Not at the actual party itself.", "Her ego is hurt.", "Everyone is entitled to their own tastes and likes. Lots of people don't like sports or aren't interested in science or whatever. If that's the case and everyone around you is talking about that thing you have no interest in, the decent thing to do is just sit there and politely follow the conversation exactly like you do with her friends. What you don't get to do is just constantly shit on people for liking that thing and try to belittle them for having that particular interest. Your wife sounds exhausting and just plain rude as hell.", "There is a difference between no liking something and looking down on people who do", "Well, can you point out why she should cut it out? Taking emotion out of the equation to maintain objectivity in science is one thing. But the way she is burning bridges for zero valuable returns is illogical. Keeping her nasty thoughts to herself costs nothing! She has already seen first-hand how her arrogance has very real, lasting consequences in getting uninvited from gatherings.", "I disagree. Your friends extended the invite multiple times and, while she was a guest, she was incredibly rude. No etiquette is breached and you WOULD be the asshole if you tried to force your friends to invite her.", "I am changing my judgment to NTA. It seems to me a person who claims to enjoy intellectual pursuits would have the ability to make the connection between cause and effect. \n\nI noticed you wrote to another poster that your wife said she wouldn\u2019t go, but wanted to be included. While she should have backed out gracefully before, or better yet, behaved herself, you should have had a talk with her before it escalated. If you don\u2019t want these friendships to be a bone of contention, you should try to fix things between them. You should also make an effort to be nice to her friends (if her accusation was true). \n\nI\u2019m not a sports fan either, but I would never insult my husband\u2019s friends. I would emphasize to my spouse she needs to be friendly. If she agrees, could you invite your friends to your house so they can see she wants to be part of the group? If not, you may decide to have separate friend groups.", "Your wife shouldn't act like a fool when she's invited. If she's going to attend she doesn't need to belittle other people's interests. If she can't behave, she needs to stay home.", "Difference being when you go out with her friends you don\u2019t spend the whole time shitting all over their hobbies and minimizing their hobbies. This isn\u2019t about passions it\u2019s about etiquette and courtesy.", "Do not ask the host to extend an invite to your wife if your wife\u2019s sole reason for wanting to go is so she can be rude and insulting. Your friends will stop inviting you in order to not have to deal with your wife.", "My husband loves to fish and once or twice a year I pack a nice lunch and tag along. I don't spend the whole day moaning and ruining his hobby.", "Well you said it went politely frosty after that.  Sounds like you've had enough time and space to reflect. I hope you get to the heart of it together about what you want, need, or expected from each other about being with each other's friends and engaging in their worlds.  You don't have to be interesting or knowledgeable. You don't even have to be interested in the subject.  You don't even have to say much about it itself.  The big unifying thing is that people care about stuff - engage them about how they're feeling. \"You must have been excited\" or \"that must be frustrating\" works. \nFor what it's worth, you sound like you're genuinely trying and have the limitations of\"asshole versus not asshole\" on here to cloud that a bit. I honestly bet you'll come together stronger and it sounds like you want that. Hope the next talk goes well.", "But your friends are being rude to you also by not inviting your S.O. I don't know... I personally wouldn't wanna go if my friends just didn't invite my spouse. But I would talk to my spouse to put a bit more of effort or staying home if she didn't want to go.\n\nTo me, is a ESH here: your spouse, you and your friends.", "Kid, Lol, I'm old enough to be your mother. Thankfully I'm not because I'd be very disappointed in myself if I raised somebody as pompouses as you.", "Understood. But you reflect back on other parties, where you feel she brings the mood, etc down. Why are you not having conversations with her about that immediately after those parties?", "I am not a sports fans\u2026. AT ALL.  I\u2019ve been to Super Bowl parties, etc.  Just enjoy the company, the food and drinks.  It\u2019s not that hard.", "Broadcasting that you are old and out-of-touch isn't the brag you think it is. \n\nIt's 2023, people are allowed and encouraged to have their own friends and hobbies outside of their spouses. Why should he snub his friends when he agrees with them and neither them nor he has done anything to break the friendship?", "Than you should probably consider why you're so miserable you want to rub it onto others online than. It might have something to do with your attitudes toward being a controlling, possessive and entitled brat.", "I have. She has continually said she \u201cdoesn\u2019t see the value\u201d in sports. I have told her that she doesn\u2019t even have to watch at these parties, but can just enjoy the food and company. That doesn\u2019t stop her from talking crap at these events. The last party someone said \u201cwe did this\u201d referring to the team, and she went on a rant about how \u201cwe\u201d did nothing as we aren\u2019t on the team.\n\nIt\u2019s embarrassing when she does stuff like this.", "Lol, it's a privilege to be old and I'm not out of touch, but nice try.", "Lol, I'm not miserable, controlling possessive or an entitled brat, that's you just reaching and projecting.", "Your initial post doesn't make it clear that  you've had repeated communication about her being a Debbie Downer. In all fairness, if I had a couple like that in my friend group, I would just not invite the couple, it's a bit of a bold move your friends still invited you.", "You clearly are extremely out of touch seeing as your judgement and advice was universally derided. And congratulations if you think it is everyone else who is wrong and you are the only enlightened one, you share that trait with the tens of thousands of other old out-of-touch people in the world. \n\nEnjoy being as ostracised and unsupported as OP's rude, socially inept wife.", "It's an opinion.
