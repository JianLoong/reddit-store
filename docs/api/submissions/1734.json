YTA. You have absolutely no right to ask your partner to give up his parental rights.\n\nThis also makes no sense. Child support orders do not magically dissappear if you sign away your visitation rights.\n\nIf you don't like his situation with his children, then it is perfectly alright for you to leave. It is not okay to pressure your partner into being an absent father.", "YTA. Who is he going to sign over his rights too? Unless the moms are married and their husband wants to adopt them he will have to continue to pay child support.", "Listen he made those kids. He is responsible for them till they are grown up. Why doesn't he go to court to set up proper visitation?  \nBut tbh it seems to me that he has at least 5 kids with 3 different mamas who all don't want him to see them. At some point you have to ask yourself what he did to deserve this treatment.", "YTA. Don't sign over his rights, go to court and have them re-evaluate child support if you're that upset on how much he's working to be able to afford it.", "YTA. And you don't understand how this works.\n\nHe can't just \"sign over his rights\" to his kids. Generally, there has to be someone else ready to step up and take his place (like a step parent adoption). He is not allowed to just throw up his hands and say he doesn't want to pay any more. \n\nIf he hasn't seen the children since 2017, that's on him. He could have filed for visitation and get court ordered time. Why would the mothers who care for these children full time just hand their kids over to a person who is essentially a stranger? He needs to put in the time to get to know them. \n\nAs for what he pays, there are calculators that figure that out and take into account parents' income, number of children, etc. It's calculated on what he makes. \n\nChild support *is not* payment to see a child. It is payment to support the child he helped create.", "YTA\n\nSeeing the kids or not, they are still his kids, and he has the moral, ethical and legal responsibility to financially support them.\n\n What he needs to do is not sign away rights, but rather get a better lawyer to get visitation enforced if the primary caregivers refuse to follow court ordered visitation.  Or else petition for primary custody due to attempted alienation.  \n\nThis sounds as if you're just annoyed that he has to take responsibility for kids, and would rather have him dump them than have him do the work that lets him be an active father in their lives.", "YTA \n\nYou knew he had kids before you got with him, part of that is him paying child support.\n\nIt\u2019s messed up that he doesn\u2019t have contact with them if he wants it but you signed up for this when you got with him.", "YTA. I also don't think you are giving us the whole story either. A state CAN force visitation if one parent is withholding visitation and, if the state is \"in shock\" by the amount of child support he pays, they absolutely can lower his obligation. You are definitely leaving something out.", "Sounds like there is a lot missing here. Are there legal visitation orders in place? Has he gone through the courts when denied visitation? Does he want a relationship with his children?\n\nBut yes, YTA if you are asking him to sign over his rights to his children solely because of the money.", "YTA.

None of it works like that.\n\nIf \"signing away rights\" got parents out of paying support, there wouldn't ever be a deadbeat parent in jail.\n\nYour guy has 5(?) kids with 3-4(?) different women.

What you should be asking is how to get custody and visitation enforced, rather than how to enable your bf to be even less of a parent.  \n\nThere's so much information not provided in this argument the ONLY vote I could possibly give is YTA  \n\nHonestly, if YOU want to help the situation, marry him.  Right now, in the eyes of the courts, you're a liability; basically the stand in babysitter for when he's travelling.  You should at least be the stepmom before coming here and asking if you're the asshole for doing stereotypical evil stepmother actions.\n\nBF kind of sounds like he's in a catch 22 situation.  He works long hours away from home to make money to support his kids, which he doesn't get to see because he's always away for work.  \n\nWork with the system, \"I want to see my kids, but I cannot make the required money without a travel job.  I want partial custody AND the support reduced on par with the other parent's reduced custody.\"  It's a pain and might be a long slog, but lets face it, you're not going to get things changed unless you use the system that they're already abusing.

I refuse to believe he hadn\u2019t had a *single* chance to see his child in 5yrs due to work. Does he FaceTime? Call? He can still make an effort.\n\nGo to court and get visitation ordered. If mom is refusing visitation then have it documented that she\u2019s voiding the agreement or call the cops to have it enforced. \n\nThe state is in shock but can\u2019t lower his CS? Well\u2026 that\u2019s a lie.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you fight for him to *see* the kids instead of signing over rights?

He doesn't actually try to enforce visitation and see three of his kids.\n\nChild support is supposed to put the kids in the same position they would be if the parents stayed together.  It is for their benefit because it isn't their fault their parents aren't together and they deserve the same life they would have had otherwise.

Someone else has to be waiting to step into that role.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, signing over parental rights doesn\u2019t terminate financial support in many states. Secondly, he has a financial obligation to the children he made. He\u2019s clearly been extremely absent in their life, the least he can do is help support them.

He is supposed to get visitation through Kids Connection with his daughters, but the mom keeps making up excuses not to take the girls there. And when he asks to see his son , his mom changes the subject. My boyfriend currently travels for work to make the amount of money he makes to pay child support for them. He has 2 other children that he gets to see, but misses out on time with because he is always working. He hasn't seen 3 of them since 2017 and the youngest was 6 months old. They don't even know who he is at this point. Last year they both asked for more money, but still haven't allowed him to see the children. (They have no legal reason to keep the children away either.) The state is in shock at how much he pays but says there's nothing they can do to get him to see the kids or lower his child support. I told him it's not fair to us to lose out on him. And that if he doesn't get to see them, what's the point of paying for the next 10+ years? I would rather see the kids, but after almost 6 years it seems like a loss. AITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP\u2019s boyfriend has at least 5 kids with at least 3 women. Yes, women do solely choose to continue a pregnancy or not. That does not absolve the other biological parent of any responsibility. After the first kid or two. OP\u2019s DH could have figured out a new plan if he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for a boat load of children. I am guessing he is a bro who thinks condoms don\u2019t \u201cfeel good.\u201d"]}
