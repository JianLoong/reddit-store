I do wonder if your \"calmly stated\" replies were actually as calm as you state/think they were, though.  It's possible that you being a little high may have given you a colored perspective and/or if you have anxiety/depression issues there might be some comorbid ADHD in there or something similar that makes it hard to modulate/perceive your volume correctly (I say this because I have ADHD and have been significantly louder than I thought myself at times).\n\nI'd check in with your son on if, a, he felt like your emotional response was different than it seemed to you; and b, ask him during a time you're not smoking to talk with you about how it makes him feel and why.  He's a teenager so he might not be able to articulate it, but if it's removed from the situation/pain point, he might be able to come in less emotionally heightened and able to share better.\n\nBut ultimately, you're the dad, you're not doing anything illegal or forcing it on him, and he was in a mood and giving you attitude.
