I do wonder if your \"calmly stated\" replies were actually as calm as you state/think they were, though.  It's possible that you being a little high may have given you a colored perspective and/or if you have anxiety/depression issues there might be some comorbid ADHD in there or something similar that makes it hard to modulate/perceive your volume correctly (I say this because I have ADHD and have been significantly louder than I thought myself at times).\n\nI'd check in with your son on if, a, he felt like your emotional response was different than it seemed to you; and b, ask him during a time you're not smoking to talk with you about how it makes him feel and why.  He's a teenager so he might not be able to articulate it, but if it's removed from the situation/pain point, he might be able to come in less emotionally heightened and able to share better.\n\nBut ultimately, you're the dad, you're not doing anything illegal or forcing it on him, and he was in a mood and giving you attitude.

OP isn't saying how much she smokes or if she does it until she's impaired, but a standard commercial edible will almost certainly leave her too impaired to drive for the rest of the night.\n\nNot to mention, different strains of joints will have different effects (physical, mental, and emotional). In my experience, edibles just have one setting (and that might not be the effect OP is seeking).\n\nVaping might be a good option, but edibles really aren't equivalent.\n\n\n(NTA, by the way!

That she was going to lose her job and become an emotionally abusive waste just like Bio-mom.\n\nBut my Mom sat me down when I was calm and talked to me about it, not just why she smoked (to destress and sleep at night) but she asked me why I was upset about it, what bothered me about it and what my fears were. Her trying to understand why I was upset at a calm, neutral time not when she was smoking or had smoked helped me feel heard and like she actually was trying to take my feelings into account (unlike Bio-mom\u2019s approach of: \u201cYou know I smoke weed right? Cool, let\u2019s now watch this movie about fraught mother-daughter relationships while I get stoned\u201d)\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is, trying to talk to your son while you\u2019re smoking clearly isn\u2019t productive, maybe trying talking to him when you\u2019re both calm and just hanging out and you might get a more productive answer from him.\n\n(Sorry for formatting, I\u2019m on mobile!)", "NTA. \n\nI hate weed and weed smokers too.
