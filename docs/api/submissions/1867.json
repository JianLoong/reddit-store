Your GF should be extremely grateful she's getting a vacation at all.", "NTA, she's being ungrateful and immature. If she wanted France so bad she should have saved up for it herself.", "NTA, Paris is just a random large European city, there's nothing inherently romantic about it. Your girlfriend sounds entitled and exhausting. Maybe rethink this whole thing, and I'm not talking about the trip to Martinique which is btw is 100% a better vacation than Paris, no contest.", "NTA, girlfriend sounds quite immature. It\u00b4s a very nice gesture :)", "NTA! She's acting like a child who got a brand new purple bike when she wanted a pink one. \n\nYou've done something lovely for her - the best you can do given the circumstances - and yet instead of being grateful, she's been entirely dismissive of the thought and effort you've made. \n\nBig red flag OP.", "NTA\n\n\nThis sounds so \"disney adult\" like. I'm a woman and a disney fan but she sounds sooo awful. \n\n\n\nReally rethink the relationship because you want a partner who supports you too and she sounds like she isn't there for you. I get not being able to contribute fincially but she seems to not carry any responsiblity for the situation in her mind, is not grateful and not there for you emotionally.", "NTA, I'll go with you instead. I won't make you feel bad about it the whole time.", "NTA\n\nWhat you tried to do was a really nice thing, and your GF responded like an immature, entitled AH. You\u2019re doing your best in really hard times, and instead of understanding that your GF was actually mean about it. Tell her to organise her own trip to France.", "Wow NTA. I wish my husband would surprise me with a trip anywhere haha. She's lost her job so she should be happy that she's going anywhere especially the Caribbean!! 3 years isn't a big milestone. Maybe 5 or 10? She's acting spoilt", "NTA. I probably wouldn't have phrased it as going to France, because you knew what she meant and this wasn't it. But that wasn't even a blip to her ungrateful behavior. At this point, if she wants to go somewhere else, she can plan it and book it. And now you know not to surprise her with nice things.", "NTA i think it was a brilliant idea, you both dont have the finances to go to France and now she still gets a beautiful trip\n\nHonestly i dont get her at all", "God your girlfriend doesn\u2019t know France! I\u2019d love to go on that island with you! I bet it\u2019s a lot nicer than France, which is just overrated, imo. \nI think, considering your finances and everything it was a great idea. \nNTA, obviously.", " Your girlfriend is not open to compromise despite your heartfelt efforts.\n\nNo hate to France, it's a beautiful country. But not even being open to Martinique? \n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. This sounds like an amazing compromise given the current economy and a way for her to go to France when she otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to.", "NTA, what an entitled child. Your boss was kind enough to allow it, and you\u2019ve tried to compromise by getting her to have a vacation. Might not be her ideal location, but at least you guys get to travel somewhere new whilst on a budget. \n\nNot saying you should break up with her, but probably give a good hard thought on wether you\u2019re ready to spend your life with someone that has this attitude. If she\u2019s mature enough for a sit down talk, you both need to have it. Things like finances and adult stuff is something both parties should be clear on, and if she\u2019s making a stink about not getting her way due to financial constraints, that\u2019s a bit of a red flag.", "NTA your girlfriend needs to be a bit more grateful for you.  You seem like a wonderful boyfriend, and I assume you live together and you're supporting her while she's unemployed.  How could she expect you to provide an expensive trip when you're on a limited salary?  She can be disappointed, but she should understand that you're doing the best you can.  \n\nIt's the thought that counts and so forth.", "Nta. I would prefer any type of holiday to celebrate an anniversary if the money was tight. Maybe she's thinking that the money that was saved up for France has now gone on this holiday and that she's now even further away from going there. I honestly think this is a nice gesture, coming from a good place and i would fully take advantage of it. She needs to understand that until your finances are ok you don't have to put yourself in a situation that you're unable to pay for rent, groceries and bills just because you \"need\" to go somewhere you can't afford.", "NTA at all, this is actually really sweet taking her on a vacation even when time and money is tight right now. She should be more grateful in my opinion.", "info\n\ni never understand why foreigner think that france is an exceptionally romantic place.\r  \ncan anyone tell me why ?", "NTA- This is such a sweet gesture in a time of difficulty and hardship. Your gf's entitlement while not having a job to help pay for this trip(since it's your anniversary, too, not just hers) is absolutely astounding.", "Well it is not France so fix the title. Also your gf is spoiled as fuck. She is unemployed and still expect you to make a trip happen. I mean it is anniversary right so why are you the only one paying? What is she giving you for anniversary? NTA obviously cuz you still managed to have a trip. If she doesn't start appreciating what she have instead of crying about what she didn't get i personally wouldn't be with her anymore. Like she will never be satisfied or happy if she doesn't get exactly what she asked for even if it's birkin bag.", "NTA - Easy solution: If she wants to go to france tell her she can get a job to finance it.\n\nBeing disappointed that something you wanted for a long time isn't coming true is one thing. Putting pressure on the sole breadwinner because a vacation on an - presumably - beautifull island isn't good enough is deep asshole teritory.", "NTA.\n\nShe totally ignores the current situation and absolutely does not appreciate your efforts and the surprise to come with you.", "Wow, your girlfriend sounds like a peach. You are NTA. You\u2019ve done your best to give her a wonderful surprise and she\u2019s acting like a petulant child. If she wants to go to France so badly, she can get a job and help pay for it.", "NTA. Just did a quick search and Martinique is a part of France? Has she romanticised the city of Paris while ignoring the negative things?", "NTA. Break up.", "NTA. Anytime my partner wants to brings me somewhere, I get excited. It means they\u2019re thinking of me and want to share the experience with me.", "NTA I would rather go to Martinique than Paris. And even if she preferres going to mainland France it is very harsh to call your nice surprise a \"slap in the face\". Are you torturing her with a good time or what", "NTA.,  This girl isnt the girl for you.  The girl for you would have understood how  money works and been happy for this.  Move on and find some one new. She would most likely been upset in  Paris if you didnt propose to her there.", "NTA\n\n Cancel her ticket and dump the entitled child.", "NTA. There should be more people like you in the world.", "NTA she completely dicarded the gesture you were showing and didn't even check out the place before saying no it looks like instead of spending time with you she just wanted to go see Paris for wich she can plan a trip herself for both of you if she wants to go so much you did your best and she should be happy instead of being a child", "NTA you didn't have the resources to take her to France, what are you supposed to do? Pull the money out your arse? Does she know how tight money is for you both?\n\nIt sounds like you found a frugal way to have a getaway with your girlfriend, is it the same as a romantic trip to Paris? No. Is it incredibly thoughtful and resourceful? Yes.", "You\u2019re NTA. Your girlfriend\u2019s failure to understand the financial resources needed to go to France and accommodate a change is concerning.", "NTA your gf is an entitled brat. If I'd lost my job and finances are tight I'd be jumping at a chance to go to Martinique for FREE.", "NTA.", "NTA- she\u2019s not working right?", "NTA.  Judging by your description, she is probably not going to like France anyway.  Paris is wonderful, but it\u2019s not people walking around with berets and playing the accordion.", "NTA you tried to compromise to give her the closest thing you can afford. Is she putting any effort into this trip? Its not just her anniversary its yours too. Mutual effort needs to be put into it.", "NTA, but your girlfriend sure is. She needs a reality check if you aren\u2019t in a good financial position and she can\u2019t be grateful for 1) your thoughtfulness, and 2) an exotic holiday", "Hold on TIL that taking your s/o on a trip to a Caribbean island is a slap in the face! Tell her that comparison is the thief of joy! That you have done as much as you can on limited funds. If she is moody and miserable then you know this person is selfish and entitled. She has no job I did not see you saying she is close to a new one just moping about! You promised France when everything is sorted having on income is not sorted! Thankfully her true colours are shining bright and you can act accordingly to this information as it shows you a small window into your future with her! Honestly it does not look bright or rosy!NTA", "No, really NTA. \n\nWhat the hell?", "NTA, she sounds like a child... and an ungrateful one at that.", "NTA she should be looking for a job, not a holiday abroad. She'll also be probably crushingly disappointed by how romantic France truely is and I wouldn't want to be in a 10 km radius of that tantrum", "NTA\n\nFrance is France, Paris is Paris even if it's a part of France.\n\nI mean... I come from Reunion Island myself (look at Africa. Go down. See Madagascar. Look at the two TINY DOTS nearby. One is Mauritius, one is Reunion Island) and... it's still France. I mean... LOL.", "NTA. She said France but she probably meant \"Paris\" at a minimum.", "NTA\n\nYour GF is an unemployed ungrateful ass. You aren't struggling financially, she is. She's already on vacation everyday and you're paying for it. Despite the difficult circumstances you're taking her on an 8 day Caribbean vacation to the lesser Antilles. She isn't just unappreciative of what you're doing for her, she resents it. She is beyond entitled. She's showing you who she is and it isn't a good look. She doesn't GAF about sharing this experience with you. She DGAF about celebrating your anniversary. She DGAF about your feelings. She only cares about what she gets. Frankly, I'd view this as a potential deal breaker. She's proudly waving one hell of a red flag. If you switched roles in this scenario I wouldn't be the only one saying this.", "NTA .. your GF is incredibly ungrateful", "NTA. You sound a little callous about your girlfriends dream of travelling to France. But she\u2019s an idiot if she\u2019s unemployed and thinks it\u2019s a good time to take an expensive trip. \n\nI think Martinique would be an amazing trip, especially with most of the costs covered!! She\u2019s allowed to be a little disappointed, but she needs to grow up and realize this is a great opportunity for where you are in life.", "It's not even close to France or French. It's a French territory(so please don't go there thinking it is like France). BUT STILL a beautiful trip to the Caribbean. It's a totally suitable substitute until you both can afford France. Your GF needs to grow up and deal with life's set backs better and be happy . NTA", "NTA\n\nIf SHE wants to go to France, then SHE can organize (and pay?) a trip to France\n\nShe sounds pretty entitled", "ESH. I know everybody else is saying NTA, and your girlfriend is kind of an AH for saying it's a slap in the face. But you shouldn't have presented it as \"fulfilling my promise\" because they speak French there, and you shouldn't have surprised her with a fait accompli. \n\nShe's dreaming of France not because she wants to hear people speak French. She probably wants to see the sights, eat French food, maybe go to the Louvre. If somebody wants to visit Great Britain, you don't surprise them with a trip to the Falkland Islands and say it's pretty much the same thing. \n\nShe's right, you should have asked her first. You could have said you're really disappointed you can't afford the France trip this year but would she like to go with you to Martinique, and maybe extend the trip a few days? She could have had input, said if she'd like to stay longer. I don't think she'd have called you an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
