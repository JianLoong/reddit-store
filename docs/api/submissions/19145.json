His parents are great and they\u2019re very close so that\u2019s not why he didn\u2019t want to temporarily move in with them. We\u2019ve fought about it a lot before we moved and we\u2019re still arguing about it now because he thinks it wasn\u2019t necessary and I\u2019m stressing over nothing which maybe I am but that doesn\u2019t magically make the stress disappear. He\u2019s said multiple times that I forced him to move here but he could\u2019ve stayed at our house like I said. \n\nI can\u2019t expect my mother-in-law to visit everyday and I feel better being in a house with other people around. My husband does sometimes WFH but he\u2019s usually holed up in his office so it\u2019s like he\u2019s not here anyway so this is better for me.

It's very valid that you would want family support in a time like this, but I wouldn't be surprised if this move has hurt your husband in the sense that he's been made to feel like he's not good enough support for you. Like, the vibe is \"your mother is the one who makes me feel secure in my pregnancy, not you and our shared home.\"\n2. When moving through these kinds of big life milestones, people usually like to feel as though they're moving forward, not backward, and for most adult folks, moving back in with their parents (who usually have a set of house rules and continue to infantalize their children even when they're grown) make them feel like they're moving backwards. Your husband might feel like he's being treated like a kid, even though he's about to become a father. \n3. This might be the biggest one.... unless a relationship is over or abusive, both sides of a couple need to agree unanimously about these kinds of things. You essentially didn't give him a choice in this, and told him \"I'm removing myself and your unborn child from our current state of life, you can either buck up and join us or be sh\\*t out of luck\". That's not particularly kind or fair as a partner. \n\nAll this to say, I know that pregnancy is a tough time that's strife with worries and emotions. But that said, your partner is still entitled to fairness and empathy. It's his life too.", "INFO: why do you have to *live* with your in-laws to feel supported? couldn't you easily spend a lot of time over there without actually moving in for 2 months?", "YTA\u2026.did you take into consideration there may be a reason your husband doesn\u2019t want to live with HIS mother? \n\nAlso, it\u2019s unhealthy to drop \u201cdo this or I\u2019m leaving\u201d in a marriage.", "I know this sub is normally pretty gentle on pregnant folk (and I get it) but yeah, YTA \n\nYou basically gave him an ultimatum and if he didn\u2019t do what you wanted you were going anyway.

Why didn\u2019t you involve your own husband in this decision? Moving in with your in laws against the will of your husband sounds like a pretty extreme measure to deal with your anxiety. What will you do once the baby is born?", "The thing you should actually note here is the fact that your husband, the father of the baby, doesn\u2019t make you feel safe and secure even in your own home. \n\nYou needed to go to your in-laws to start feeling secure.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna pass judgement here because I don\u2019t think the question you asked is actually the one you need to ask.", "YTA, to yourself and to him.\n\nYour anxiety is controlling your life AND being a massive detriment to your partner.

You\u2019re letting your anxiety make disruptive changes in your life so you should make an effort to try to learn to cope with your anxiety instead of making unilateral decisions. You technically didn\u2019t force him to move, but you basically forced him because you said I\u2019m doing X either come or don\u2019t come off but I\u2019m doing it. You would have most likely been upset if he stayed at y\u2019all\u2019s house and now you\u2019re upset that he\u2019s upset that he was pressured into moving. You basically gave him a no win situation on his end so how do you think he\u2019d react?", "Yeah YTA. I get being scared but you don't need your MIL there 24/7.  You will need to learn to do things that work for you and your baby, not just rely on what your MIL says to do.", "YTA \n\nOf course his parents are allowing this because if they said no, you might not let them see the child as much out of resentment or have a strained relationship!

Renting, owned, did you sell the house? This seems pretty extreme for a pregnancy.", "YTA\n\nI get that being pregnant is a lot but for grown adults to need their parents raising them when they're raising a kid is extreme.

Right before one of the BIGGEST moments in your relationship, you decided to go and live with in-laws. Meaning he now has to go and live with his parents. RIGHT before having a new baby.  \n\nThis is your time to settle into parenthood together. To prep the baby stuff, talk about the baby, get some rest, and have some 1:1 time. I get it that you feel alone at home. And I think you are feeling some fear (it appears from your short post to be more irrational extra fear than normal pregnant lady fear).  \n\nWith one of our kids- my wife had some complications. Doc pretty much told us the kiddo could die at any time so don't travel, don't go further than 20 minutes from a hospital, and come in every week. that was very very stressful. So we dealt with it by getitng more rest, spending time together, getting the house ready, staying in...   \n\nNot going to live with other people!  \n\nYeah you are pregnant and can pretty much dictate what you want. That is totally understandable. BUT you are not considering your husband in this who is going to be the coparent, father, etc.  \n\nAre you planning to live at your in-laws after the baby?   \n\nI would be livid if it was my wife. As we are supposed to be in this together.  \n\nGood luck- I hope the baby is super healthy and the birth is quite easy. I know its stressful and there are a million things that can happen. Many women alienate their husbands around the birth of a child (and many husbands/dads just stink too).

He argued with you, and he's sulking now, but you got your way.\n\nIf you told us that you insisted that your family move in with your in-laws AFTER your kid was born, I think that's fair. It's not right for every couple, and I'd probably discourage it generally, but I can see that in some cases it might feel necessary. \n\nBut moving in MONTHS before the birth of your child? That seems pretty extreme. Which isn't to say I don't believe that you're very worried, and that you feel like you need round-the-clock help during this time. But it does make you an outlier, and something a reasonable person could get frustrated about. I get that the pregnancy is affecting you more than it's affecting him, and that you feel that your husband should perhaps be more appreciative of the care you're putting into your pregnancy. But surely you recognize that MOST people live relatively normally throughout a pregnancy, and to insist on large changes that most people don't make can reasonably cause a feeling of resentment.", "You need to mature a lot before the baby arrives.

I have given birth twice, and both experiences were pretty amazing. \n\nIt is ok to move in with your in-laws, especially if it alleviates your fear.

I don't even have kids and i can understand her wanting someone there who has gone through what she is going through now. With her mother so far away she went with the next best thing.

You're an adult you're about to have a baby you're going to be in charge of this little tiny human being that you have to care for.

His parents are great and they\u2019re very close so that\u2019s not why he didn\u2019t want to temporarily move in with them. We\u2019ve fought about it a lot before we moved and we\u2019re still arguing about it now because he thinks it wasn\u2019t necessary and I\u2019m stressing over nothing which maybe I am but that doesn\u2019t magically make the stress disappear. He\u2019s said multiple times that I forced him to move here but he could\u2019ve stayed at our house like I said. \n\nI can\u2019t expect my mother-in-law to visit everyday and I feel better being in a house with other people around. My husband does sometimes WFH but he\u2019s usually holed up in his office so it\u2019s like he\u2019s not here anyway so this is better for me. My in-laws are more than happy to have us here but my husband is still sulking and gives me an annoyed look whenever his parents say something about his habits that he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH. Both you and your husband need to take this more seriously. You need to deal with this anxiety directly and not just by getting more \"support\" from MiL (I'm not sure what sort of help you need in the third trimester unless you have some sort of condition like hyperemesis gravidarum). Once the baby is born whatever you're feeling now will get much worse due to a combination of a neurochemical crash post partum and being utterly exhausted. What's the plan at that point? Just foist everything onto MiL and dive deep into ppd?\n\nGet professional help and admit to yourself that whatever you're feeling right now is far beyond the normal level of anxiety. Your husband needs to step up and understand where you're at as well. For your child's sake you cannot ignore this, you need to be able to care for yourself in order to care for another human. If you go into this thinking that you just need to wait out this anxiety you're going to have a bad time.", "So what happens once the baby is born?  You know it will just get harder and more stressful. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, I\u2019m thinking you need professional help. You moved out of the home changing your lifestyle which would greatly affect your partner who is about to be a father as well. It doesn\u2019t sound like you considered trying to resolve your needs and his together as a team at any point and that\u2019s the problem.", "Softly, YTA. It sounds like his parents are somewhat controlling, maybe a \"my house, my rules\" type of situation. Most adults dislike being parented after they've already individuated and moved out. It sounds like he would probably rather you two build your own life and start your own family together. He wants to create your own separate family unit.   \nYour relationship with his parents is different, they didn't raise you, and you don't have a previous set of family dynamics at play. Living under their roof and being subject to their criticisms probably feels like reliving his childhood. He's about to be a father, he should be moving forward in life, not moving backwards into living with his parents.   \nYou put him in an awkward position, a catch 22.   \nWhy would he want to live in the home alone without his wife and not be around you? He married you. Of course he wants to live with you. He followed you there because he wants to be with you. You are his family.   \nIt would've been better to stay in your own home, and visit them as often as you needed to keep the anxiety/loneliness at bay. I understand this has to be a scary transition for you, but I think most people wouldn't move in with parents to get a sense of security at this stage in their lives. They lean harder on friends, go to mom groups, and spend more time with their partners. They call home, see a therapist, or take up a hobby. Unless there is something you aren't mentioning, some kind of neglect, abuse, addiction, or scary level of fighting...   \nUnless you are concerned about the future of your relationship or his abilities as a father, you went too far. But from your post, it sounds more like you wanted to return to a more childlike state and find the safety and security of being taken care of by \"parents\", instead of taking care of yourself or leaning on your spouse. I am sorry you are experiencing this level of anxiety, and while I believe it takes a village and you need emotional support from elders, I think it's healthy to have your own space to settle into apart from the rest of the village.", "YTA.

She said she's made her choice and he's free to come or not if he want's but she NEEDS to go for her own mental health and well being.   \n\n\nShe also outlined that there is no reason he didn't want to go except he felt it wasn't necessary. I would be more on your side if she was demanding he go but that's not what happened. Or If he expressed he had strife between him and his parents. Also, not what happened. OPs husband just didn't want to live at home, which he wasn't forced to do. He was given the OK to just stay at their current home until after the birth when she'd feel comfortable returning home. There was no \"Do this or else\". It was an \"I'm doing this regardless of YOU trying to stop me, you're welcome to join or not\". I see the complete opposite of what you all do. It was the husband who didn't want her to go and didn't want to go with her because he didn't feel she was being reasonable. Aka she was being \"too sensitive\"...   \n\n\nThis thread is wild sometimes.", "(after the birth)...", "While this is 100% true it still doesn\u2019t excuse her behaviour, talk to a professional, forcing your husband to either live with his parents or alone for the remainder of the pregnancy isn\u2019t fair or right either. \u201cGrow up\u201d doesn\u2019t mean suffer in silence, it means act like an adult, realize you are struggling and seek help. (I may be biased as a Canadian where this kind of help is available and usually free/partially covered by healthcare)", "True, but even if that wasn't the case, I don't see anything that makes her an A H. Which most of the comments I've seen are stating.   \n\nAs someone else said, she's lucky in having supportive in-laws. It makes more sense moving and settling now compared to when baby is born.", "and pregnancy can cause people to have wild fears over things.  Ignoring it isnt the answer and can cause problems for the baby.  He needs to just understand that this can happen.", "I hear what your saying, but it's not her mom so I don't really get how her support is more needed than her own husband's. And why is she having a child with someone if she feels that his support is not enough or what she needs?", "Relies on her support system apparently, because husband is not enough to give her the safety and security to do it on her own. Besides, I don't see why she should take care of this kid on her own, when she has help and she wants help. Jobs come and go, this is time for everyone to embrace change and be flexible, husband shouldn't get a pass on that.", "She moved in already at 31 weeks!", "She moved in already at 31 weeks!", "I never suggested that he ignore it. But moving in two people against the father\u2019s will is a terrible option.", "If the husband \u201cisn\u2019t enough\u201d they shouldn\u2019t be having a baby together, this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s fair to do after you are pregnant. You talk about this stuff before.", "Or, maybe look seriously at therapy so that she can handle being alone as an adult? I mean, the kid isn\u2019t even here yet and she can\u2019t handle being alone with them - that\u2019s not normal or healthy.", "Huh???? \n\nYour comment makes it sound like you really DO think he needs to quit his job. How would they pay their bills? \n\nAnxiety is not rational, but OP needs to manage it better than this.", "That's one solution to the issue in theory, but they are already pregnant so totally invalid in this case. Shoulda woulda coulda, water under the bridge, pointless to talk about what they could have done differently. They can only do the best with what they have. Husband's best support seems to be worthless, so OP finding help elsewhere is a pretty good solution in my eyes. Husband has plenty of options to deal with it, and he chooses to act like a petulant child. Kinda begin to see why OP needed some adults with her for support", "How is needing support not healthy? No man's an island, everyone struggles alone. Why should she choose to be alone, when she can be in a loving and supportive community?", "Being upset about being forced to live with his parents isn\u2019t being a \u201cpetulant child\u201d I hate how this sub lets pregnant people get away with being shit humans just because they have a baby in them. \n\n Seek professional help if you are experiencing this level of anxiety.", "And I hate how this subs lets adult men throw temper tantrums for not getting exactly what they want, but here we are.\n\nSeek professional help if you have issues with authority and your parents."]}
