His parents are great and they\u2019re very close so that\u2019s not why he didn\u2019t want to temporarily move in with them. We\u2019ve fought about it a lot before we moved and we\u2019re still arguing about it now because he thinks it wasn\u2019t necessary and I\u2019m stressing over nothing which maybe I am but that doesn\u2019t magically make the stress disappear. He\u2019s said multiple times that I forced him to move here but he could\u2019ve stayed at our house like I said. \n\nI can\u2019t expect my mother-in-law to visit everyday and I feel better being in a house with other people around.

It's very valid that you would want family support in a time like this, but I wouldn't be surprised if this move has hurt your husband in the sense that he's been made to feel like he's not good enough support for you. Like, the vibe is \"your mother is the one who makes me feel secure in my pregnancy, not you and our shared home.\"\n2. When moving through these kinds of big life milestones, people usually like to feel as though they're moving forward, not backward, and for most adult folks, moving back in with their parents (who usually have a set of house rules and continue to infantalize their children even when they're grown) make them feel like they're moving backwards. Your husband might feel like he's being treated like a kid, even though he's about to become a father. \n3. This might be the biggest one.... unless a relationship is over or abusive, both sides of a couple need to agree unanimously about these kinds of things. You essentially didn't give him a choice in this, and told him \"I'm removing myself and your unborn child from our current state of life, you can either buck up and join us or be sh\\*t out of luck\". That's not particularly kind or fair as a partner. \n\nAll this to say, I know that pregnancy is a tough time that's strife with worries and emotions. But that said, your partner is still entitled to fairness and empathy. It's his life too.", "INFO: why do you have to *live* with your in-laws to feel supported? couldn't you easily spend a lot of time over there without actually moving in for 2 months?", "YTA\u2026.did you take into consideration there may be a reason your husband doesn\u2019t want to live with HIS mother? \n\nAlso, it\u2019s unhealthy to drop \u201cdo this or I\u2019m leaving\u201d in a marriage.", "I know this sub is normally pretty gentle on pregnant folk (and I get it) but yeah, YTA \n\nYou basically gave him an ultimatum and if he didn\u2019t do what you wanted you were going anyway.

What will you do once the baby is born?", "The thing you should actually note here is the fact that your husband, the father of the baby, doesn\u2019t make you feel safe and secure even in your own home. \n\nYou needed to go to your in-laws to start feeling secure.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna pass judgement here because I don\u2019t think the question you asked is actually the one you need to ask.", "YTA, to yourself and to him.\n\nYour anxiety is controlling your life AND being a massive detriment to your partner.

You\u2019re letting your anxiety make disruptive changes in your life so you should make an effort to try to learn to cope with your anxiety instead of making unilateral decisions. You technically didn\u2019t force him to move, but you basically forced him because you said I\u2019m doing X either come or don\u2019t come off but I\u2019m doing it.

You basically gave him a no win situation on his end so how do you think he\u2019d react?", "Yeah YTA. I get being scared but you don't need your MIL there 24/7.  You will need to learn to do things that work for you and your baby, not just rely on what your MIL says to do.", "YTA \n\nOf course his parents are allowing this because if they said no, you might not let them see the child as much out of resentment or have a strained relationship!

Your self-centered, entitled attitude is out of control.", "Umm what? Where were you living before? Renting, owned, did you sell the house? This seems pretty extreme for a pregnancy.", "YTA\n\nI get that being pregnant is a lot but for grown adults to need their parents raising them when they're raising a kid is extreme. Visitation should cover the support you need.\n\nI would talk to a professional about your anxiety being at this level and try to join some online mom groups it can help having others going through the same thing to talk to.", "YTA.

Right before one of the BIGGEST moments in your relationship, you decided to go and live with in-laws. Meaning he now has to go and live with his parents. RIGHT before having a new baby.  \n\nThis is your time to settle into parenthood together. To prep the baby stuff, talk about the baby, get some rest, and have some 1:1 time. I get it that you feel alone at home. And I think you are feeling some fear (it appears from your short post to be more irrational extra fear than normal pregnant lady fear).  \n\nWith one of our kids- my wife had some complications. Doc pretty much told us the kiddo could die at any time so don't travel, don't go further than 20 minutes from a hospital, and come in every week. that was very very stressful. So we dealt with it by getitng more rest, spending time together, getting the house ready, staying in...   \n\nNot going to live with other people!  \n\nYeah you are pregnant and can pretty much dictate what you want. That is totally understandable. BUT you are not considering your husband in this who is going to be the coparent, father, etc.  \n\nAre you planning to live at your in-laws after the baby?   \n\nI would be livid if it was my wife. As we are supposed to be in this together.  \n\nGood luck- I hope the baby is super healthy and the birth is quite easy. I know its stressful and there are a million things that can happen. Many women alienate their husbands around the birth of a child (and many husbands/dads just stink too).

He argued with you, and he's sulking now, but you got your way.\n\nIf you told us that you insisted that your family move in with your in-laws AFTER your kid was born, I think that's fair. It's not right for every couple, and I'd probably discourage it generally, but I can see that in some cases it might feel necessary. \n\nBut moving in MONTHS before the birth of your child? That seems pretty extreme. Which isn't to say I don't believe that you're very worried, and that you feel like you need round-the-clock help during this time. But it does make you an outlier, and something a reasonable person could get frustrated about. I get that the pregnancy is affecting you more than it's affecting him, and that you feel that your husband should perhaps be more appreciative of the care you're putting into your pregnancy. But surely you recognize that MOST people live relatively normally throughout a pregnancy, and to insist on large changes that most people don't make can reasonably cause a feeling of resentment.", "You need to mature a lot before the baby arrives.

His parents are great and they\u2019re very close so that\u2019s not why he didn\u2019t want to temporarily move in with them. We\u2019ve fought about it a lot before we moved and we\u2019re still arguing about it now because he thinks it wasn\u2019t necessary and I\u2019m stressing over nothing which maybe I am but that doesn\u2019t magically make the stress disappear. He\u2019s said multiple times that I forced him to move here but he could\u2019ve stayed at our house like I said. \n\nI can\u2019t expect my mother-in-law to visit everyday and I feel better being in a house with other people around. My husband does sometimes WFH but he\u2019s usually holed up in his office so it\u2019s like he\u2019s not here anyway so this is better for me. My in-laws are more than happy to have us here but my husband is still sulking and gives me an annoyed look whenever his parents say something about his habits that he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH. Both you and your husband need to take this more seriously. You need to deal with this anxiety directly and not just by getting more \"support\" from MiL (I'm not sure what sort of help you need in the third trimester unless you have some sort of condition like hyperemesis gravidarum). Once the baby is born whatever you're feeling now will get much worse due to a combination of a neurochemical crash post partum and being utterly exhausted. What's the plan at that point? Just foist everything onto MiL and dive deep into ppd?\n\nGet professional help and admit to yourself that whatever you're feeling right now is far beyond the normal level of anxiety. Your husband needs to step up and understand where you're at as well. For your child's sake you cannot ignore this, you need to be able to care for yourself in order to care for another human. If you go into this thinking that you just need to wait out this anxiety you're going to have a bad time.", "So what happens once the baby is born?  You know it will just get harder and more stressful. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, I\u2019m thinking you need professional help.

It sounds like his parents are somewhat controlling, maybe a \"my house, my rules\" type of situation. Most adults dislike being parented after they've already individuated and moved out. It sounds like he would probably rather you two build your own life and start your own family together. He wants to create your own separate family unit.   \nYour relationship with his parents is different, they didn't raise you, and you don't have a previous set of family dynamics at play. Living under their roof and being subject to their criticisms probably feels like reliving his childhood. He's about to be a father, he should be moving forward in life, not moving backwards into living with his parents.   \nYou put him in an awkward position, a catch 22.   \nWhy would he want to live in the home alone without his wife and not be around you? He married you. Of course he wants to live with you. He followed you there because he wants to be with you. You are his family.   \nIt would've been better to stay in your own home, and visit them as often as you needed to keep the anxiety/loneliness at bay. I understand this has to be a scary transition for you, but I think most people wouldn't move in with parents to get a sense of security at this stage in their lives. They lean harder on friends, go to mom groups, and spend more time with their partners. They call home, see a therapist, or take up a hobby. Unless there is something you aren't mentioning, some kind of neglect, abuse, addiction, or scary level of fighting...   \nUnless you are concerned about the future of your relationship or his abilities as a father, you went too far. But from your post, it sounds more like you wanted to return to a more childlike state and find the safety and security of being taken care of by \"parents\", instead of taking care of yourself or leaning on your spouse. I am sorry you are experiencing this level of anxiety, and while I believe it takes a village and you need emotional support from elders, I think it's healthy to have your own space to settle into apart from the rest of the village.", "YTA.

He's not hitting you, abusing you verbally or in any other way, or otherwise neglecting you. From what I can gather, the worst thing he has done is work\u2014which is a pretty necessary form of support during periods like this. He even occasionally works from home. And no, it's inaccurate to say that someone who works from home \"might as well not be there\" because they do so from an office. Expecting families where the father works 7 days a week, out of the house, might think that is a pretty privileged mindset.\n\nIf I had to move back in with my parents, I would be livid. Especially if it was due to my wife's manipulation, and the fact that she \"didn't like being in the house alone.\" I bet your husband sulks. My mother and I get along fine, but staying with her for even a few days is mentally draining and anxiety producing. I've worked very hard to get to a place where I can exist in my own house on mine, and my partner's, own terms without parental involvement.\n\nThe point is, you made this decision alone, and didn't consider or care about your husband's input. This decision has severe negative effects on your husband's mental health, confidence, and overall happiness\u2014all of which you apparently ignored because you *really* couldn't bear the thought of staying in the house alone when your husband wasn't WFH. And you even admit you may be stressing over nothing.\n\nOP, you are inconsiderate. I don't doubt you're under a lot of stress, but even you don't seem to be aware of the source.

YTA. \n\nWhen I was pregnant, I wanted to be independent with our child and do the parenting and LEARN. My husband on the other hand always wanted us to be at his parents or grandparents. It started out with us staying in their home the first week, but even after we went back to our place he couldn\u2019t not spend all his time there. It wasn\u2019t that we couldn\u2019t handle it, he\u2019s just a mommas boy and didn\u2019t like to stay at home with his own little family, he wanted to be with his watching tv on their sofa eating their snacks. Yuck. And I was always there with him because I didn\u2019t want to be home alone without him. I had my kiddo, but we both wanted dad too. We couldn\u2019t establish a real family routine or dynamic because every chance he got he\u2019d take off to his parents. I\u2019d work early mornings and by the time I\u2019m off he was there, I\u2019d have to go to their house to get my baby back and see him. Then I\u2019d take night classes and get out at 9, guess where he was? I\u2019d have to go pick up my daughter, go home, put her to bed, get myself to bed, so I could get up early again the next day. He would stay at his parents until he decided to come home. Long story short, we\u2019ve been divorced for almost ten years now. \n\nThere was nothing less attractive to me than someone who didn\u2019t even WANT to grow up, move out, man up, support their family, and enjoy that quality time raising up the family they started. Learning is a huge part of the process, you\u2019re robbing yourself of it. Learn by doing! Pride is kindof a big deal when it comes to confidence. You have no confidence and now that means your husband has to forfeit his pride and come with you lest he be abandoned til after the baby arrives. Instead of being proud that he is learning to raise his baby his way, he has to tuck his tail between his legs and do it with you, mommy, and daddy watching and criticizing. He can\u2019t be proud of supporting his pregnant wife and unborn child, because he\u2019s not\u2014 his parents are. What a shitty position to be in. \n\nWhat\u2019s your end game here? What are you hoping to gain from this? Because you could gain a lot of confidence and pride by learning as you go like every other first-time parent on the planet. Read a book, subscribe to blogs, find a good parenting group on Facebook or Reddit. Take classes. Have your OB on speed dial, have every route to the hospital mapped. Learn about breastfeeding, cluster feeding, ANYTHING. Give yourself some tools so you don\u2019t have to be so scared. But leaning on your hubby\u2019s parents when he wants to be the man of his house is just rude. \n\nIt\u2019s time to put on your big girl panties and have faith in yourself, your body, and your husband. His parents are close which means they are a phone call away if the two of you truly cannot figure things out. You CAN birth this baby and you CAN care for this baby. You do not need his mommy and daddy for that. You do not need your hand held. You know who does need mommy and daddy? Your baby. Your baby deserves a wholesome and loving home where both parents are attentive and loving, can communicate and make compromises. You don\u2019t feel comfortable yet, and that\u2019s understandable, but relying on others will not make you stronger, it will only hold you back from feeling like you\u2019ve got this handled. However, if you do choose to rely on someone, it should be baby daddy.

Mine was a normal pregnancy that developed severe complications at the last minute and would\u2019ve been 100% federal outside of the hospital. Emergency C-section and NICU, etc. \n\nEven in non-deadly scenarios, most women have permanent affects from childbirth and pregnancy.", "And humans have been dying from pregnancy and birth since literally forever.

Natural doesn't mean it's not dangerous. Ebola is natural, anthrax and opium are natural. She's being a bit ridiculous for sure, but both of these things can be true. Pregnancy and birth are absolutely *big deals,* just ones that don't necessarily need 24 hour care.", "said the guy who has never gone through any form of pregnancy in his life", "Ya...just because he doesn't like his choices don't mean they're not choices. My thoughts will always be with the well being of the mother. The fact a NEW mom who's never given birth before and is frightened (which is a reasonable thing to feel) is being shamed and lambasted for wanting support is fucking WILD. Her husband isn't home frequently and when he is, he's locked in a room working. She just wants and need some support that he's not able to provide. She's taking care of herself in the best way she can from people who are more than happy to have her.   \n\n\nI think that's fucking great. I'm so happy OP has family to support her. Would you be shaming her if she went back to her own direct family?

The post indicates she is planning on moving back home after the baby is born.", "She clearly says they would move back home after the delivery lol", "How temporary (after the birth) which sounds like she just want support until she gives birth.

I'd like you to come with me, but if you don't that's ok, I'll go and you can stay home\"?", "Why should he quit his job? OP doesn't need him there, specifically. She managed her anxiety by moving in with other people. She doesn't have time to learn coping skills, she's in crisis mode and her husband's belittling comments and tantrums don't help. But you know what does? Having supportive people around who'll help her if and when her worst fears do happen. Or share her joy when everything goes well. Husband has the option to be a part of all that while keeping his job and attempting to act like an adult. Throwing tantrums and sulking as a grown man is not normal, he needs to manage his emotions better", "The inlaws say they are happy for her to move into help out, the alternative would be getting them to move in, which I assume the husband wouldn't have liked even more, and if the husband is out working, then he might not be able to provide her needs in that moment.\n\nWhat if she passed out while she was alone?

Luckily she wasn't alone when those things happened.", "This is not a thing that happens in civilized countries. \n\nBut barring that, I don\u2019t even see how that\u2019s possible. 3 weeks out my son had just been discharged from the NICU, and I was still very much NOT recovered from my C-section.", "I didn\u2019t have paid maternity leave either, and I\u2019d planned to work as long as I could.

She drew a line and told him to come or stay. It's wrong. I dont care how pregnant you are, you don't undermine your partner. But I guess the difference is I will always give my wife a say in any situation. She doesn't have that basic respect for her husband. \n\nA solution for her stress could've been worked out with her husband. He could drop her off every morning and pick her up on his way back from work, but that isn't an option because she said so. \n\nI really don't care about the complications, and this isn't pre modern era so you can throw those stats in the dump, has nothing to do with this situation right here. \n\nThis problem is she drew a line and she's asking if she's an ass, and yes she is an ass.", "Wow I guess it\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s not the 1800\u2019s.

Definitely not as far as worker rights  and healthcare go.", "well that's terrible and i'm sorry that happened to you. it doesn't sound like OP is in the same boat, it sounds like she is just nervous about being alone when her husband is gone. which is fair, but moving in with your in-laws is a bananas extreme way to fix the problem.", "Not to mention that if it truly was cultural on her side, HER parents would have come to stay with them even though they don't live close.

Therapy can take years to make a break through, even months before the person starts to find the right coping mechanisms. She doesn't have that time. Also, pregnancy related anxiety, depression, rage, and psychosis are hormone based and, especially for someone who normally has no mental health issues, be scary,  nearly uncontrollable and can escalate quickly.

That's not to say she shouldn't pursue therapy or talk to her ob/midwife about this. She absolutely should. But, for people saying she needs to grow up and just deal with feeling anxious, stress can be very dangerous during late pregnancy. It can make you go into labor early and/or make labor longer, more painful, all kinds of complications. Pregnancy can really make you feel crazy, not for everyone, but for a lot of people.

The husband was given the option to stay in his own home but his constant reminders of it to OP sounds extremely manipulative. Instead of the husband finding a solution he wants to lay blame on a very pregnant OP. \n\nI had to handle postpartum during the pandemic and with my husband going back to work after the very first two weeks, something inside myself was urgently telling me something was deeply wrong; getting through my postpartum issues and 68 hour labor during the pandemic I had planned to unalive myself with a fresh newborn. My mom (my remaining parent) was diagnosed with cancer so was unavailable to help with night feeds, my in-laws are abroad. I learned seven months later from specialist postnatal psychiatrists that I had an extremely rare hormone disorder that gave me existential dread whenever I breast-fed. It\u2019s so rare the four OB/GYNs I worked with during birth had never heard about it, nor did a majority of of midwives, nurses and lactation specialists in my network. Everyone who gave birth around me, had either siblings or both sets of grandparents to the baby. I was completely alone.\n\nI went six whole days without sleeping more than 2.5 hours a night. I made various plans thinking that my newborn would be better off without me.  I injured myself a few times in that process. I was weak and I needed help. I had to quit breast-feeding for my own mental health and jumped on anti-depressants once I was diagnosed. \n\nIt\u2019s an entirely western societal pressure and phenomenon to want to live alone instead of an intergenerational household to help raise new children. In fact, with the husband, continuing to complain about living with his parents is more likely that he might not be attuned to the nesting instinct. Typically that \u201cnesting instinct\u201d comes with understanding that the baby\u2019s needs come first over pride and ego\u2014 as well as put it in the nursery together and making sure that everything a baby might need is attained within reason and is available. \n\nThe saying that \u2018it takes a village\u2019 is because a single human cannot raise a newborn without anyone to allow the mother to sleep much less recover from childbirth. \n\nOh yeah, and 68 hours of labor\u2014 on day three I had a fever of 104 degrees F which ultimately caused so much trauma to my newborn that his blood pressure was dropping during every contraction, while I was hemorrhaging and my teeth were chattering between pushes. A staff of 13 people had to rush into my delivery room because at hour 65 they thought they were going to have to do an emergency C-section, because the baby was pressing against my pelvic bone and my blood pressure started spiking because I was fighting that fever. When the baby finally came out, they ripped him out of my arms because he wasn\u2019t breathing\u2014too much time during active labor made his lung fill with liquid. I gave birth at 3 PM but I wasnt released by my nurse until past midnight \u2014just 2 AM the following day so I didn\u2019t get to see my own baby the same day because he was hooked up to IVs in the NICU. I didn\u2019t want to leave my bed for three weeks after I got home, but I wasn\u2019t discharged until after a week of being in the NICU at my kid\u2019s side. \n\nBut yeah the husband\u2019s feelings are hurt because OP knows she\u2019ll need extra help that\u2019s beyond visitors /s", "There isn\u2019t really an ultimatum here - \u201cyou can stay or go, but I need to do this\u201d isn\u2019t demanding anything out of him?", "She also says husband works from home, he\u2019s just busy working during the day so she\u2019s lonely. Idk what she does.", "I wasn't working when I was pregnant and MG husband worked. Our families lived 12 hours away. If I needed support I called my mom or messaged one of my sisters. I wouldn't have up and moved in with either set of parents.", ">She could have major anxiety\n\n\nSo let's bring a child into the world before I resolve my anxiety.  Good plan!", "Exactly. Getting ahead of postpartum anxiety and depression are a must here.", "OP will end up being one of those parents who doesn't know which side of the baby is up and panics everytime baby cries.\n\nShe needs therapy for her anxiety and to realise that she and her husband are going to be responsible for another human soon. They need to work together, not expect everyone else to coddle them.", "Whereas by 31 weeks, I couldn't fit behind the wheel safely.", "Why is it her illness that is risking her marriage and not her husband's lack of support?", "I'm so sorry you have so much pain. I hope you have a good delivery and that the pain will subside soon after.", "Ohh those drives home are torture. They let you go from the hospital and you think you'll be okay getting home. Nope. I had a longer stay after my second C-section and was aware that the drive home would hurt. I still want counting on it hurting as much as it did. And that was on very well maintained roads with hardly any speed bumps. \nOn my second pregnancy I had provided pain from day 1. I was still going to the physical therapist to get help for pelvic issues due to a miscarriage. And then one day she was like, \"hey your pelvic problems have changed. Are you pregnant.\" And well I was planning on buying a pregnancy test on my way home. I still bought the test and yes I was pregnant.", "Manipulating her way through marriage. \n\nOP's husband is questioning his life choices right now.", "Yeah I don\u2019t get this either\u2026 and not just that. She says she has to move in because it would be too much for her MIL to visit every day. Why on earth can\u2019t OP go visit MIL and then come home? \nShe\u2019s being extremely demanding and needy\u2026 can\u2019t say I\u2019m confident about how she\u2019ll go as a new mother, yikes!  YTA", "It wouldn't surprise me if this is the husband's first wake-up call that will eventually lead to their divorce. Not now, but 5 more years of *that* will eat you down to the core.", "But don't you know? You're always supposed to side with your pregnant wife! She's a saint for creating new life! /s", "I would argue in a healthy partnership you take care of each other when the other party isn\u2019t feeling well for whatever reason.   Do you not do anything for your partner when he\u2019s sick?", "I\u2019m one of those mums \ud83d\ude02 \n\nbut a bit of help would, have been so lovely", "Well said.\n\nI hope OP considers getting some help for her very obvious anxiety, because things aren\u2019t going to be any less fraught with worry once the peanut is here.", "The threat of removing baby from him was wayyyy out of line. Using the baby as a pawn and it\u2019s not even born yet is a HUGE red flag.", "all of this, except i think OP is a huge asshole because of #3. yes, the baby is in your body. but he/she is ALSO your husband\u2019s baby and he wants to be around for his child (and probably you of course but you\u2019re an adult). you said he is often home but it doesnt feel like he is - but he IS home in case an emergency happens and you need to let him be there for you if he\u2019s the one you\u2019re choosing to have the baby with. it\u2019s really crappy to steamroll him like this. it might take a village but the whole village doesnt need to be under one roof", "Also to note, I love my parents and we are close BUT since I have grown up and moved out, I can't stand more than a weekend with them. Not for any bad reason, but it just feels like there is a sense you need to act a certain way, or as OP mentions, that parents will always have their opinions on their children's habits, and the husband probably wants to avoid that. You as a person are you, but there is a difference between you in the office, alone, with friends and with parents; you are gonna feel conflicted in how to act. Something I also realised when writing this... Being alone, when you live with your parents you can be alone usually in your room, when you move in with a SO, you no longer have the bedroom as the alone room, so then you may have your office, man cave, shed or whatever that is your space you can be alone... Moving back home you no longer have your space, and seeing as you're moving in with you SO the bedroom is also not a space to be alone, I can see how that could stress someone out, not feeling like you will have any space to call exclusively your own for a few months.", "This is a huge point. A big red flag in OPs post is acknowledging she may be acting irrationally, but she doesn\u2019t care, and just wants to do what she feels will erase the stress. What an immature way to deal with anxieties. \u201cThis might not be a real problem but rather than me working through it, here\u2019s an ultimatum.\u201d", "Without more context, this is my first thought as well.", "I came to say this, in my culture it\u2019s very common for the new mom to stay with her mother, sometimes even a sister, usually another experienced mother. It\u2019s about easing the new mom and dad into parenthood and helping out whenever they can, like letting the new parents sleep or making sure they are also eating - it\u2019s a really happy and exciting time. Some new parents stay for a few days and some a few months. \n\nThe couple should\u2019ve definitely talked about this before but I wonder that\u2019s what she means about staying with her mother-in-law.", "It's their pregnancy.\n\nOr are we back to excluding men from this?", "OP doesn't have PPD.\n\nNor has she mentioned PPD.\n\nSo bringing it up is....well it seems like just trying to excuse OP's behaviour.\n\nAll the things you talked about with MIL can be done with visits. They don't need to live there.", "She needs a *good* therapist because if she\u2019s freaking out now, there\u2019s a good chance that postpartum depression is going to be *bad.* However, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s just an attention seeker, in which she still needs a therapist. OP, YTA.", "Exactly what I was thinking. OPs wife needs a therapist, not for her MIL to hold her hand literally 24/7. The second that baby is born she's going to demand and need even MORE help and things will only get worse. This amount of anxiety when she's not even close to giving birth needs professional attention", "I\u2019m logistics minded and I\u2019m like\u2026so are you going to make a temporary nursery at the parents and then take it down when you go home? \n\nI\u2019m 30w 1d and we are finalizing the nursery and the bedside nursery (we plan to have the baby sleep in our room for the first few months) and there are so many things for baby, for me (both post partum and for breastfeeding) and for my husband and I can\u2019t imagine trying to get set up in another house, even temporarily. \n\nAlso, like\u2026I want to be able to watch TV, without my shirt, in my living room and then crawl into my bed after those late night feedings I\u2019ve heard about.", "Well unless his the one risking his life and pushing a melon out of his body, pretty much yes. \n\nThe more stressed the mother is the worse the outcome ends up being for mother and baby. Just in case OP is reading these comments I wont elaborate on the process your body goes through whilst giving birth but I would advise you to read up on it if you're interested.\n\nIf he can't handle the discomfort of living with his parents, how will he manage the baby?", "I lived with my aunt for 6 weeks with my second due to medical reasons and covid (making it hard to travel from rural to urban to get to my hospital). I love my aunt, she was a perfect host but I was crawling the walls by the end of the first week.", "Yeah I would have thought that would be more the norm.\n\nI have a big extended family, and when one of my grandmother\u2019s children/children-in-law has a baby, she often goes and stays with them for a week or two, especially if they live abroad (in which case it\u2019s longer-term). Even if she doesn\u2019t do that, often she and my grandpa will look after the baby\u2019s older siblings while mum\u2019s in hospital or she\u2019ll cook some meals or the like. I always thought that was well above the \u201cobligatory\u201d baseline, especially since there are lots of siblings who could pitch in (although to be fair, they do in other ways).\n\nNo one ever moved in with them with a newborn (although come to think of it, my uncle and aunt did move into a flat on the property at one point - but I think they\u2019d been living there well before my aunt got pregnant. And that was pretty exceptional - my grandfather\u2019s job came with a mansion at the time, although it was partly used for conferences and hosting international work-related visitors).", "My partner was pretty damn useless through pregnancy and post partum. He was great with our son but could not wrap his head around what happened to my body and thought that because a woman\u2019s body is \u2018meant\u2019 to carry a child that the effect it had wasn\u2019t that big. Living with my parents definitely saved my ass because my mum knew and could somewhat sympathise (she had 2 natural births compared to my one traumatic c-section). She knew that I wasn\u2019t going to want visitors and go out to take my son everywhere etc and knew I\u2019d have a hard time saying no because I was feeling broken, exhausted and lonely. My now ex would say that I couldn\u2019t be \u2018that lonely\u2019 if I didn\u2019t want to go out to see everyone so sometimes the partner really doesn\u2019t get it and having another woman who\u2019s been through it is really important", "My parents live 10 minutes from us and my MIL about 30 minutes. Both have houses that have 2 living areas. The look of relief on their faces when we said we would prefer they came to us after the birth and the jumping to \u201cwhat do you need\u201d said it all. \n\nMy brother in law and his wife moved in with my MIL when they had my nephew, it\u2019s been 8 years and their relationship has never recovered. \n\nMy parents are retired and my MIL is a charge nurse. Neither of them want to deal with a newborn full time, nor two sleep deprived parents. And really, I need the help from someone more refreshed than me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Considering the state of American healthcare I'm even more surprised!", "Info: Did anyone ever move in like OP move in with her in-laws? Or people supported the new parents?", "I worked full time as a lawyer and appeared in court at a hearing at 37 weeks.   My mother and MIL both died before I had kids.  I just worked until I went into labor, had a c section after 24 hours of labor.  And my husband went back to work a week later.   Everyone is different, but this was my normal for both children.", "Nothing indicates that. Op said she was moving in with MIL, whether hubs liked it, or not.\n\nI got a feeling she's gonna make GM raise the kid *and* take care of her. \n\nI would have told OP to go home. I do not suffer fools, or mooches. \n\nYTA, OP.", "I hope he stands his ground then and him and the baby can go home while she can say with the in laws all she wants. He could get custody as she is not fit to take care of the child on her own"]}
