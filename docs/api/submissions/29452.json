You dozed off, but it's not as though you were stone cold passed out, since you woke up when you heard your brother.\n\n> he was talking to my son and asking him how he got something\n\nSeriously? Whay response was he expecting from a 9 month old baby? *Well, Uncle, I saw it on the coffee table and was intrigued by it's shape and thought I should examine it more closely.* Or does your brother not understand than a little baby hasn't the words yet to respond to that kind of question with anything other than *abba goo baba*?\n\nThen runs and tattles to his mommy, breaking sibling code. And your mom 100% took his word and jumped on you. I sure hope you find an apartment soon and get out of there if this typical of how things go for you.", "NTA. Your brother and mother are. Being a parent is hard and exhausting. Every parent sleeps while they are a parent. It sounds like you made quite the effort to keep him safe but you can\u2019t possibly know and protect him from everything all the time.", "NAH\n\nHusbands and wives get into arguments like this all the time; it's common for parents to fall asleep with their kids when they're small, but it's also common for the other parent to get one them (how many \"my husband had to watch the baby once and fell asleep, I can't trust him!\" things are out there?)\n\nYou live with your parents and sibling. They are taking on that other nagging role in your life. You're NTA, but they are NTA also; if your brother was watching the baby and fell asleep you would also get on him, or vent about it to someone else.", "NTA it's not easy being a mom. I would want people to tell me if something's up with my child because that's my child I know him/her the best. Plus if you see your sister/gf/ wife exhausted after taking care of the kid you need to help her out. That's what a family is.", "NTA ... Being a mother can be really stressfull and it can happen that you fell asleep. Maybe you can have an open conversation with your family that you are trying your best to be a good mother but no human on earth is perfect and you would appreciate if they could understand that or even help you out..  god damn if i would See my sister Fall asleep of exhaustion i would let her Sleep and take care of her Son/daughter for some minutes ... It's family!", "NTA\n\nYou fell asleep because you are exhausted and undersupported. \n\nThe big issue is that you need a better/safer kid play-pen area. One that your brother doesn't drop things into. This is the dangerous age. They can crawl. They can easily choke, get tangled in curtain cords and strangle, fall down stairs, eat poison, pull heavy furniture down on themselves etc. So you need a 100% kid safe  place that you can plop the kid into when you are too tired to watch him like a hawk. Your mom needs to stop yelling at you and help you to obtain/create that safe place for your kid to play.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not worth making a big deal about it", "NTA. Hurry up and get out that house. Ooh mom fell asleep! SHE IS A MONSTER!!! ***the horror*** WTAF. Your mom should be ashamed trying to berate you like that. Seems like not everyone is too keen on you being a young mom. You are doing a good job, but you may need to do that good job away from people who don't seem genuinely supportive. \n\nHugs from a fellow young mom who did it too!! \u2764\u2764\u2764", "Oh you are NTA at all, I am so sorry you are being treated that way. Of course you are exhausted.", "YTA. You just sound embarrassed for being called out", "NTA but if you aren't getting child support, you need to sue for it.", "oh we all talk to him like he can answer us even though we know he can\u2019t, so he was taking it out of his hands as he asked him, not actually expecting an answer lol\nbut yeah, i definitely didn\u2019t see a point of him running off to try and get me in trouble when he knew i was awake again at that point, unnecessary in my opinion, but my family disagreed, so here i am haha\nbut yeah, it\u2019s pretty typical, that\u2019s why i\u2019m trying real hard to get out of here.", "He was rude, he could show a bit more compassion but he is 16. He just had to take something dangerous out of the hands of a toddler while his sister slept on the floor. We don't know if this is the first time she's dropped the ball like this.\n\nI know being a parent is difficult but he's not her SO or her parent and while it would behoove him to pitch in I think there needs to be some leeway when you're expecting a HS sophomore to help parent his older sister's toddler.\n\nGood thing he was up and about or something much worse could have happened.", "like i said..it\u2019s my fault i had fallen asleep. so i do blame myself. my issue was, i\u2019d rather him address his issues involving my child with me instead of other people.", "It seems your mom and brother had a pretty big reaction to you just dozing off. I mean, it happens and your mom should know that. Specially if you study and work in addition to care for a child. \n\nIs that the only thing they have \"against\" you? They called you an \"horrible mother\" just because of that? The only reason I can find to excuse their reaction is if you dozed off because you were partying all night leaving the child in your mother's care.", "i agree, he should not have to watch my son, i\u2019ve never asked him to, i don\u2019t plan to ask. he\u2019s still a kid himself. i\u2019m thankful he was awake and noticed.", "But this is important for other people to know that they need to watch your child because you might not be.", "they\u2019ve said i\u2019m a terrible mom from the beginning because i\u2019m young. so they just say it all the time", "did you not read the post fully? when he went to tell my mom i was sleeping, i was already awake again. no one needed to watch him. i had dozed off for a few minutes, woke up hearing him talking to the baby, and he knew i was awake again because i even spoke to him (asked him to take his charger with him)", "Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t ever happen again."]}
