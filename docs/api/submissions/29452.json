Whay response was he expecting from a 9 month old baby? *Well, Uncle, I saw it on the coffee table and was intrigued by it's shape and thought I should examine it more closely.* Or does your brother not understand than a little baby hasn't the words yet to respond to that kind of question with anything other than *abba goo baba*?\n\nThen runs and tattles to his mommy, breaking sibling code. And your mom 100% took his word and jumped on you. I sure hope you find an apartment soon and get out of there if this typical of how things go for you.", "NTA. Your brother and mother are. Being a parent is hard and exhausting. Every parent sleeps while they are a parent. It sounds like you made quite the effort to keep him safe but you can\u2019t possibly know and protect him from everything all the time.", "NAH\n\nHusbands and wives get into arguments like this all the time; it's common for parents to fall asleep with their kids when they're small, but it's also common for the other parent to get one them (how many \"my husband had to watch the baby once and fell asleep, I can't trust him!\" things are out there?)\n\nYou live with your parents and sibling. They are taking on that other nagging role in your life. You're NTA, but they are NTA also; if your brother was watching the baby and fell asleep you would also get on him, or vent about it to someone else.", "NTA it's not easy being a mom. I would want people to tell me if something's up with my child because that's my child I know him/her the best. Plus if you see your sister/gf/ wife exhausted after taking care of the kid you need to help her out. That's what a family is.", "NTA ... Being a mother can be really stressfull and it can happen that you fell asleep. Maybe you can have an open conversation with your family that you are trying your best to be a good mother but no human on earth is perfect and you would appreciate if they could understand that or even help you out..  god damn if i would See my sister Fall asleep of exhaustion i would let her Sleep and take care of her Son/daughter for some minutes ... It's family!", "NTA\n\nYou fell asleep because you are exhausted and undersupported. \n\nThe big issue is that you need a better/safer kid play-pen area. One that your brother doesn't drop things into. This is the dangerous age. They can crawl. They can easily choke, get tangled in curtain cords and strangle, fall down stairs, eat poison, pull heavy furniture down on themselves etc. So you need a 100% kid safe  place that you can plop the kid into when you are too tired to watch him like a hawk. Your mom needs to stop yelling at you and help you to obtain/create that safe place for your kid to play.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom should be ashamed trying to berate you like that. Seems like not everyone is too keen on you being a young mom.

We don't know if this is the first time she's dropped the ball like this.\n\nI know being a parent is difficult but he's not her SO or her parent and while it would behoove him to pitch in I think there needs to be some leeway when you're expecting a HS sophomore to help parent his older sister's toddler.\n\nGood thing he was up and about or something much worse could have happened.", "like i said..it\u2019s my fault i had fallen asleep. so i do blame myself. my issue was, i\u2019d rather him address his issues involving my child with me instead of other people.", "It seems your mom and brother had a pretty big reaction to you just dozing off. I mean, it happens and your mom should know that. Specially if you study and work in addition to care for a child. \n\nIs that the only thing they have \"against\" you? They called you an \"horrible mother\" just because of that?

Teenagers tattling to mom is normal behavior. Having a baby in the house is a new challenge for everyone. It is understandable that you\u2019re tired.

You have authority over your child but not your brother.  It's your brother's prerogative to address the issue with your mother instead of you if he thinks that will be more effective.", "NTA. Fencing of the baby's Play area, and asking the other people in the House to mind their stuff to keep that area Babyproof, and staying with the Baby when he's somewhere other than your room, and INTENDING to stay awake to watch him, and work-school-apartment-hunting, are all Things a decently-responsible Mom does that a terrible Mom wouldn't.", "YTA. It's not \"your\" living room. It's your parents house and your brother is a minor, he's allowed to leave his charger in a communal area. So not only did you fall asleep while your toddler was still awake, you didn't even LOOK to see if there was anything your child could get hurt on or destroy. Absolutely awful parenting. The fact that people are telling you it's \"not a big deal\" that you literally fell asleep while your toddler was playing are wrong and ridiculous.", "NTA", "She was SLEEPING while supposed to be watching her kid.

Not ring in an irrelevant third party unless you genuinely need intervention from them. This is so ridiculous to have their mom step in for", "You either don\u2019t have kids or you\u2019re lying. If you block off a safe area with a toddler in it by himself there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a nap. The brother should have just taken his charger and not been an asshole. If she was in her own home their wouldn\u2019t be anything to discuss at all. It\u2019s wild that her mother felt the need the shame her as a mother for no reason.

My toddler has a play pen and girl it\u2019s a life saver. Even now that she\u2019s 21 months old. You\u2019re NtA regardless. Being a mom is hard!", "Hey, it sounds like you're doing ok in a really unsupportive environment. Your baby was in a safe area, and got hold of something he shouldn't have. That happens. As does falling asleep accidentally sometimes. Being a mum is exhausting. Being a mum at 19 without family supporting you is HARD. I had my first at 19, but I was lucky and had my family helping and encouraging me. It was still hard though!\nGive yourself a break. Being young doesn't equate to being a bad parent. Being tired is just part of the package.", "If they say you're a terrible mom, then how about you throw it back at them saying how they treat you for being a young mother. If that dont work, just say you'll call someone to knock some sense into their pea sized brains. Your brother is stupid enough as it is for leaving his stuff around a small child, and your mom is for being a shitty mother to a young mother like yourself.", ">they\u2019ve said i\u2019m a terrible mom from the beginning because i\u2019m young.\n\nIf that's their logic you can always turn it back on your mom. Tell her she's a terrible mom since her daughter had a kid so young. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThis is not to say that I think you (or any other young mothers) are terrible because of their age. Terrible mothers/parents come in all ages. But if they think you're terrible because of your age why doesn't that also make your mom terrible?\n\nAlso, as a mom, if you had the area blocked off and you were right there it sounds like you're doing fine. My husband once fell asleep when our oldest was a toddler and he was out so hard that our son drew all over my husband's arms while he slept. I was at work when it happened. He was working nights, while I worked days, so he was exhausted. Everyone was ok, it happens.", "I was a mom at 19. My son is now 24 and an amazing, kind, and caring man. You did nothing wrong. It happens to us all. You are NTA, and I am so glad you are getting out of there.", "You need to get tf out of this toxic environment. NTA", "i can use baby gates at given times (to not impact others living here by forcing the entire living room to be my sons space.) so yes, that area is contained, that\u2019s why i\u2019ve asked for non baby safe things to not go there or at least be taken out once you leave the room", "Also NTA", "fast pass to getting kicked out right here", "Makes sense. If you\u2019re paying rent that is you and your sons house too. I don\u2019t blame you for looking for an apartment! Just know it\u2019s okay that this happened! You\u2019re tired! You are okay!", "Dude if it happened to me id be out straight away i aint being around a family of assholes who dont like young mothers. My mom is a young mom who lost half her kids (6 kids in total) bc of how damaged guys made her. My mom was supported, but i barely get supported for being who i am as a person. Equality is nowhere in life", "if she could just leave straight away i think she would have by now. threatening physical violence to the person u depend on for shelter or a 16 year old child is not a smart thing to do lol. especially since she is a 19 year old mother."]}
