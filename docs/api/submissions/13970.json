I didn't share any of the rental income with him thought, as I was still paying all the taxes and insurance. At this point, the mortgage is paid off. I net over 2k a month from this house, which goes into the household budget. My son just got engaged and wants to move into the house after he marries his fiance. He suggested he pay half rent and eventually buy out my share of the house.\n\nI told my son I agreed to his plan of saving up to buy out my share, but instead of paying rent, he should just take over the taxes and insurance. We agreed to this. My wife is livid and says I am a massive asshole for dramatically decreasing our household income without consulting her. She likened my decision to financial abuse. I suggested we downsize to a smaller house now that our oldest two kids are leaving the nest, and we can rent out the larger one and be in the same situation as before (owning two homes and getting rental income from one).

You have zero right to charge him **any** form of rent - he is an equal owner to you at this point. His paying the taxes and insurance is reasonable since he is using the home as a primary residence, but he is an equal owner and thus has equal right to use of the property.

Nowhere does the father say that the son is taking exclusive possession of the property; while he is moving in, nowhere does the father say \"and he is banning me from entry or use of the property.\" In fact, the father stated that he voluntarily got another home and has just been renting out the first house. Without that forced exclusivity, things like occupational rent (paid for exclusive use rights when a person with an ownership interest is **involuntarily** barred from it) do not apply. Generally the situations where one owner would need to pay another rent require a court order; they're not applicable for this exact situation.", "NTA.

However in this case your actions are understandable because she would have fought you on it. You offered your wife a solution to have rental income again. The fact that she\u2019s not at least considering it is proof that this isn\u2019t about money, it\u2019s about control.

I think there needs to be a talk with an estates, wills, and trusts lawyer before going further.\n\nHow will your other assets be divided on death? If this is your oldest son\u2019s only inheritance from you, this should be made clear to all parties involved. I feel your son should get a mortgage from the bank to make it clean here, though I understand that may make it more expensive. If not, you should definitely have a contract written out with expectations of repayment and ownership on a schedule. What happens if the son stops making payments or doesn\u2019t pay the property taxes for one reason or another? Stuff happens, and grace can be extended, but talking about this stuff beforehand with your wife will make everything more smooth.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on here with the appreciation of a large asset.

Inheritance can tear families apart, often because this \u201clast gift\u201d can reinforce pre existing notions of favoritism or family dynamics. If your other children also don\u2019t get a sweet deal on a house, it can feel like you loved them less, despite more stuff going on.\n\nI understand from other comments that your wife has not contributed to the mortgage per se on this house, and that the rest of the mortgage was paid by renters. But I would like to ask about sweat equity or other work on the house. Were you doing any of that? Did she?

You discuss it and try to find a reasonable compromise.  Perhaps the income that was earned and added to the family once the mortgage was paid off was enough to repay the expenses that were paid while it was the marital residence, perhaps not.  But to do something this major without even discussing it with your spouse is disrespectful.

Technically he has the right to charge his son some rent to cover his half of what he would have gotten from renting the property.

Were you paying off the house with money that would otherwise have gone toward the household income?", "It might depend on how the deed was set up, knowing her attitude I wouldn't leave anything to chance.", "Salty about something?", "About the late wife, OP never mentions a will. What OP is doing is out of a desire to pass on his late wife's half (that he as spouse inherited) to his son. He has no legal obligation to do this, it was fully his.", "\"we bought our new home, she wanted me to sell the old one. I said no, that this home was something my late wife and I purchased with the hope of one day passing onto our son\"\nIt's in the post. Wifey tried to pressure him to sell but he told her he wouldn't and that the house would be passes to his son.", "I feel like I've said this a dozen times at this point. The rental income was higher than the mortgage. Essentially, the house way paying its own mortgage.", "Dude, the house was that son's inheritance, his current wife has no paid off houses", "That\u2019s exactly what happened to my dad. My grandpa died and wanted to leave everything to his two sons, my dad and his half brother. \n\nBut apparently he and his wife had a shared will. And grandpas wife (not my grandma, my grandma died before I was born and he had remarried and they never had kids of their own since she didn\u2019t want kids) changed the will after he died and left everything to her sister. \n\nOh except she let my dad and his brother inherit the house they owned. But she basically stole something in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 million dollars from her husband\u2019s (of like 3 decades) two sons. \n\nI mean I get that some percentage of that money was her own money too and she was within her rights to give her own money to her sister, but it is super fucked that she was able to change their shared will after he died and just give everything that grandpa wanted to leave to his sons away to her sister. \n\nShit like this is why I don\u2019t wanna get married. Oh and then she died like 6 months after grandpa died. What a bitch. Couldn\u2019t have just died a little bit sooner huh?", "She has, from the very beginning. She tried to get OP to sell it and invest it in her and their shared kids. Then flipped when he gave him half.", "Totally agree with you that it should be verified that only his son inherits the  house if his father passes before he buys it outright.", "I consider it a moral obligation. It's what she would have wanted, and I did swear vows to her, even if she isn't here anymore.", "I thought you were saying the son gets *33% of the house*, not his dad's half of the house. I just read wrong.", "That's how we set ours up. There is enough money to cover all of them until natural death. We wanted to make sure their pet insurances were still paid and they could live the way they were in our care. I encourage more people to do it every time it gets brought up.", "Put that house in your son's name NOW and don't Tell your wife. She doesn't give a shit about your first child or your vows to your late wife and think she's entiltled to that house. Other people already said but If she asks for divorce or , Good forbid, something happen to umyoi your son can lose out in that house and in his mother's hard work. You are the only one who's looking out for him, OP.", "He has the right to do with his property that he owned long before his 2nd marriage. That includes giving it to his son, which was a decision also made a long time before the 2nd marriage. It was predetermined, and hardly unilateral.", "Well, ok, fine. I \"claimed\" we didn't know something that I could have found by making additional search. I apologize and will follow your example from now on.", "No, he owns 50% of the house (A) after his mother. Dad owns the other 50% (B). From this other half (B) the firstborn will own 33%. So if the son doesn\u2019t buy his dad part (B) after dad\u2019d death, the son will own 50% (A) + 33% of (B)", "This was my point. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but am wondering if she\u2019s got a legal claim to half the house in the event of divorce. If she does\u2026she\u2019s got a moral claim to be a part of what happens with it while they\u2019re still married. If I were married to you, I might understand your logic, but if we\u2019d talked for years in a shared way about what to do with the house, then you suddenly made a unilateral decision about it, I\u2019d be upset. You either need a prenup saying \u201cthis house is mine only\u201d or you need to acknowledge that you can\u2019t just give it away without talking to me. \n\nYou should also ask about the lookback period. If she does file for divorce and you recently gave the house to your son, it could look like hiding assets, or reducing them to avoid paying your fair share to her. Once you sign that marriage license, \u201dwhat\u2019s mine is mine\u201d gets more complicated. \n\nAs I said, not a lawyer, and happy to be corrected."]}
