My late wife and I bought a three bedroom house when we got married. When I remarried, my current wife moved into this house with me, but I never put her name on the deed. The house was only in my name.\n\nMy wife and I ended up having several children and needing to move into a bigger house. When we bought our new home, she wanted me to sell the old one. I said no, that this home was something my late wife and I purchased with the hope of one day passing onto our son. I would make it a rental property instead. That was one of the biggest fights we ever had. She insisted we compromise, but I refused to do so.\n\nWhen my son graduated from college, I put his name on the deed to the house with mine, which was another fight, but I felt he was the appropriate inheritor to his mother's share. I didn't share any of the rental income with him thought, as I was still paying all the taxes and insurance. At this point, the mortgage is paid off. I net over 2k a month from this house, which goes into the household budget. My son just got engaged and wants to move into the house after he marries his fiance. He suggested he pay half rent and eventually buy out my share of the house.\n\nI told my son I agreed to his plan of saving up to buy out my share, but instead of paying rent, he should just take over the taxes and insurance. We agreed to this. My wife is livid and says I am a massive asshole for dramatically decreasing our household income without consulting her. She likened my decision to financial abuse. I suggested we downsize to a smaller house now that our oldest two kids are leaving the nest, and we can rent out the larger one and be in the same situation as before (owning two homes and getting rental income from one). She called me a selfish prick and won't speak to me now.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1680613116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bie0f/aita_for_not_charging_my_son_rent_on_a_home_he/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's trying to seize property from your son even though he is the rightful inheritor. She wouldn't do this if it were her biological child, needless to say your wife just doesn't care for him. \n\nAlso, you clearly stated that you already own a large house, and since your kids are moving out, you can move and rent out that house, whichll probably bring in more profit. You're being reasonable while she is acting selfish.", "A father that remarries + more kids and acknowledges older son. You are a rare species op. NTA", "NTA, it's not your wife's house. It never was. She seems to have some misplaced entitlement. This isn't financial abuse, not even close. While I agree that couples should come to a mutual decision on financial matters, she should have stayed clear of this one. All of your reasoning for doing what you did what right and just. If anyone is being abusive, its her. You can tell her that silence is an abusive form of manipulation. She sounds incredibly selfish tbh.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA, it\u2019s your house, always has been and you can do with it whatever you want. \n\nYour wife likening this to financial abuse is borderline laughable. Yes, 2k is a lot of money to miss every month, but you suggested other compromises that would benefit all of you, whereas it seems she\u2019s only thinking about herself. Is she working? Does she contribute to the household budget?\n\nFrom the info you provided so far, NTA.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour son's name is on the title. You have zero right to charge him **any** form of rent - he is an equal owner to you at this point. His paying the taxes and insurance is reasonable since he is using the home as a primary residence, but he is an equal owner and thus has equal right to use of the property. Frankly he should have been getting half of the rental income as soon as his name was on the property (payment for you denying him use of what was now joint property), but what's done is done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife is mad because the household is losing the rental income, but honestly, tough shit. It sure as hell isn't \"financial abuse\" and I suspect she's just angry because you dared to give a shit about your son when he's not one of **her** children.", "NTA. I would have voted differently if your wife hadn\u2019t been consistently against you keeping this house for your son since day 1. Normally giving up a large part of your income without discussing it with your spouse isn\u2019t ok. It\u2019s the equivalent of quitting your job and telling her about it after the fact. However in this case your actions are understandable because she would have fought you on it. You offered your wife a solution to have rental income again. The fact that she\u2019s not at least considering it is proof that this isn\u2019t about money, it\u2019s about control. Maybe you should ask her if she would be so against this if you made a similar arrangement with one of the kids you have together.", "Money does weird shit to people man, buckle up.

I'm going to assume not.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour son was morally entitled to his mothers share of the house. Not your new wife or your joint children. Your wife trying to take it from him is financial abuse maybe not legally but morally. She is being greedy...Your son's name is not Cinderfella.\n\nYou need to have it out with your wife, truth is she will probably outlive you and with what is going on in likelihood your son from your previous marriage will not benefit from her will. You are just getting ahead of it. \n\nIt wasn't her property she doesn't get a say. BUT and it's a big one she wanted the property sold and now it has been....... to your son. She got her way just not in the way she thought she is going to have to wait for the money.", "NTA\n\nYour wife sounds almost narcissistic. You should really tell her to go to counseling. Married or not it is none of her business especially since you told her beforehand.", "NTA but your wife is a big, massive and greedy one. Stop listening and don\u2019t compromise with her about it. You are doing the right thing, you are a good father.", "NTA. I sympathize for your wife because it's a bummer to lose so much of your income, but you and your late wife made a financial decision together with your money at that time, with the goal of providing your son a home for this exact moment.

She should be involved in decisions that affect your household income.", "YTA , the house is yours (and your son's) to do with as you see fit, but the money was shared between the two of you (if I understand correctly). You should have at least talked to her before lowering your collective income 2000$. Having a plan to get it back would be great, but it means she'll be forced to move again. Those are things you have to decide, or at least discuss, together", "YTA.\nUnless you and your first wife paid cash for the house, which it appears you did not (you say the mortgage was recently paid off) the majority of the house has been paid for while you have been with your second wife. So while you purchased the house with your first wife, her actual financial contribution isn\u2019t anywhere near 50% of the house value and giving your first son the home, based on the fact that your first wife had a 50% ownership isn\u2019t true and unfair to your current wife and children.", "NTA you're allowed to be generous to your son and it seems alarming that your wife be so concerned about losing money she gets from you given you say you guys are fine without it.", "NTA\n\nDoes your current wife even like your son?

Seems like you guys could use some marriage counseling and maybe a lawyer/financial advisor.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is bad to want your son to have this house.

She seems to feel entitled to your Son\u2019s share and that makes her the asshole. I would only be upset about the communication part.", "I agree with you. The dealings related to the house were always between OP and his kid, but the wife should have been aware that the status quo was likely to change if the intention was always that this would end up being his child\u2019s house as his \u2018inheritance\u2019 from his mom. And that said change was in the offing should also have been communicated, even if he (entirely rightfully!) wasn\u2019t going to change his mind. \n\nI am leery of the wife trying to previously have that house sold to pay for \u2018their house\u2019 - smells of pretty deep and long running issues in the relationship between OP and his wife and of his wife to her step son/his son. Accusing him of financial abuse over this is also quite a stretch, and a pretty difficult thing to walk back once it\u2019s been said.", "[deleted]", "I'm not saying he should be charged rent, I'm saying that, in a marriage, you need to discuss these things with your partner. A $2000 decrease in monthly income is not something you should decide on your own, even if it's your own property.", "I think it's both. The 2k is/was obviously nice to have. Although our oldest kids are 19&18 now, and I think our expenses are soon to drop. Both are still living at home, but 19 plans to get a place with classmates next semester, and 18 is looking at universities not within driving distance. We will not need this big house forever.", "Oh, gotcha. You had me freaked out for a second there.", "Her argument is that the house was half his mom's and therefore only half his and so he should be paying rent for the other half. I think it's fair that he simply save up and buy me out like he said, and this will happen faster without him paying rent. I don't want to be my son's landlord. That makes me uncomfortable.", "The house isn\u2019t hers and she\u2019s being greedy and jealous", "well they might be a couple, but she has as much of a say as a homeless has, none", "The decision on moving houses and changes in expenses is for both of you to make - no question about it. If I understand correctly you can afford your current house and lifestyle even without the 2k, it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a nice to have. If this assumption is correct then I stand by the NTA, your wife is not entitled to this money and it\u2019s not going to make any difference in her life.", "Your wife doesn't seem to keen on preserving your son's property or inheritance. If you want to make sure he gets his share of whatever you leave behind, you need to have that set in stone before you die. Because if you do die before your wife, she could go try and screw your son out of what is supposed to be his.", "But you also said that you have not shared the \u201crental income\u201d with your Son? She\u2019s only logical when it\u2019s in her favor. Your feelings about not wanting to be your Son\u2019s LL are valid too. Your Son has a great attitude too and he lost his Mom. I think you\u2019ve been *fair.*", "[deleted]", "NTA yep, if your wife wants him to pay half rent then you need to back calculate all the money you took and didn't share with your son.  Your wife cannot have it both ways.", "doesnt apply to things bought before the marriage if i am not wrong?"]}
