He\u2019d be taking out a mortgage with 50% positive equity. If he can\u2019t afford 1/2 payments plus escrow, then he can\u2019t afford the property. Is his \u201csaving\u201d only to qualify for a better loan? How long will it take for you to receive the money?

I think there needs to be a talk with an estates, wills, and trusts lawyer before going further.\n\nHow will your other assets be divided on death? If this is your oldest son\u2019s only inheritance from you, this should be made clear to all parties involved. I feel your son should get a mortgage from the bank to make it clean here, though I understand that may make it more expensive. If not, you should definitely have a contract written out with expectations of repayment and ownership on a schedule. What happens if the son stops making payments or doesn\u2019t pay the property taxes for one reason or another? Stuff happens, and grace can be extended, but talking about this stuff beforehand with your wife will make everything more smooth.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on here with the appreciation of a large asset.

If the house is worth $1M now, vs $2M when you pass (and he is the sole owner) how is that value taken into account in the rest of the estate?\n\nI\u2019m not saying this stuff to be petty, but you should figure this stuff out now. Inheritance can tear families apart, often because this \u201clast gift\u201d can reinforce pre existing notions of favoritism or family dynamics. If your other children also don\u2019t get a sweet deal on a house, it can feel like you loved them less, despite more stuff going on.\n\nI understand from other comments that your wife has not contributed to the mortgage per se on this house, and that the rest of the mortgage was paid by renters. But I would like to ask about sweat equity or other work on the house. Were you doing any of that? Did she? Did she do work as a landlord (checking on tenants, handling contracts and communication, scheduling repairs)? Did she pull greater weight in your household that allowed you to do this yourself? There are ways she probably contributed to the house. Not saying she has 50% ownership, but if she was operating with a marital financial \u201cwe\u201d, she may feel like you haven\u2019t been on the same page, approaching it \u201cyou and I\u201d.\n\nI feel her reaction her is more about being blindsided about decisions being made without her, outside the martial \u201cwe\u201d, and then being informed of them after the fact. Especially the estate implications.\n\nRenting out your current house and buying a new one may be a good idea, but the way you presented it may have struck her as dismissing her concerns and again cutting her out of decisions, especially highly emotional estate decisions.\n\nThis stuff is hard, but you need to approach it as a team. NAH.", "Yes, but that was only for a few years and less than what we would have been paying in rent. It's not really a contribution. The amount she benefited from the later renting out of the home is a much, much larger sum. She made more money than she would have putting that money in a high yield savings account.", "As someone who\u2019s mother died when I was a child, had his father and step mother screw him out of his grandfathers inheritance, I expect that I will get screwed again when my father dies and my step mother gives us kids nothing. Please make sure you make a will. Money makes people greedy and entitled.", "OP said he was using it to pay the mortgage so it was only recently in pocket.", "That sounds really complicated. My son and his fiancee have good jobs. I was thinking either they will save up the money or get a mortgage for the value of the half he doesn't own.", "I already got my tax return from last year, and the tenants have already moved out. None of this is relevant anymore. The person who received the income declared it, as is right and proper.", "I unfortunately think that no matter what he did, even if he discussed it that the outcome would have been the same. She seems to resent the son that isn\u2019t hers which sadly happens too often in these scenarios. I\u2019m glad OP at least looks after his eldest and didn\u2019t end up favoring his new kids more. I see that happen constantly here. It\u2019s depressing.", "Sounds like you have every defense lined up for her arguments. \n\nThe next thing I would do if I were you, I\u2019d ask her if this has anything to do with her being concerned with what the plan is if/when with you or her pass away, for the children you have together?  She may be worried that there will be favoritism in your will where your oldest will get more than your shared children, or she will not get what she deems is fair because she thinks you\u2019re oldest will get what she considers hers. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of possibilities. But I think in regards to the first house, you\u2019re being fair to your oldest.", "Did you have a prenup that protected the first house? Or did your 2nd wife have a legal claim to half the house? Disclaimer: not a lawyer, but have lots of divorced friends.", "Paying a morgage or paying dad? same contract, same terms. instead of banking fees you pay direct. The only difference being if something happens to you the balance is his inheritance or not if you so wish.", "The house was never in her name. It was in mine and my first wife's name. Then it was just in my name. Now it's in mine and my son's name. When he buys me out, it will just be in his name. She has never been on any documentation for the first house.", "Yeah, I see your point. Logistically, you are right. However, there is an emotional complication to being your own kid's landlord.", "As many others have pointed out OP could be in the wrong legally if half the house is sons inheritance and OP has kept the income from it- I'm assuming this is because son has *technically* been paying off the house through distribution income?", "If you think this ordeal might be marriage ending, give the house to your son *now*, get your name off the deed, and do not tell your wife. \n\nIf your name is still on the deed if/when she files for divorce she could be entitled to half of your half - especially if she paid any of her salary to mortgage, taxes, or upkeep and has documentation to prove it.", "You\u2019re his landlord under the current \u201ccontract\u201d as well. Just because he\u2019s not paying rent and instead saving to buy you out, you\u2019re still the current 1/2 owner.", "But you understand why getting monthly payments from your own kid is awkward, right?"]}
