You didn\u2019t go to your brother\u2019s funeral and your parents think YTA because of that, or are you saying your brother should be the AH because he left you out of his will?\n\nAssuming your brother has family and kids it\u2019s not at all surprising he left you out of the will. And the fact that you\u2019ve taken the opportunity to make your brother\u2019s tragic death somehow all about you suggests your parent are probably right. But they way you\u2019ve written this it\u2019s rather confusing. So who knows?", "NTA, but you maybe citing too hastily in a time of extreme stress. Give yourself time to settle down and reassess. But don\u2019t feel bad for skipping the funeral - your brother was the source of a lot of trauma in your life.", "Yta. Why declare yourself dead to your parents? Are you mad they were upset you didn\u2019t attend the funeral? Are you punishing them for your brother being left out of the will? There seem to be something else going on here. I hope you have someone to talk to and that you can work through things and restore the relationshi with your parents", "Is this real? Why would you expect anything in your brother\u2019s will? And he included a proviso if you didn\u2019t attend his funeral you would be cut from his will? Not buying it.", "Why would you want something from his will? You didn\u2019t get along so that makes no sense", "What do you mean when you say \u201crebellious teenager\u201d? also your brother wanted you to go to a boarding school or a troubled kid school? Not TA for skipping the funeral but YTA for expecting anything from your brothers will.", "Your husband and in-laws don't understand because they aren't arseholes and seemingly haven't been raised or related to arseholes.\n\nThis is the reality of being a cycle-breaker. Someone who steps away from the toxicity and ends the psychological violence. I'm sorry you were the forgotten child and you did deserve reparations. Take peace in that he cannot hurt you anymore and keep your parents on block. What a pack of arseholes they are. NTA.", "From the comments I see the argument was just about the funeral and not that you were expecting some inheritance.   \nNTA. He was less than a stranger to you, bringing only detriment into your life and you don't go to the funeral of every acquaintance that disliked you. They literally stopped being reliant on him the moment that he passed, and if he left everything to them then I assume he didn't have kids himself? They are likely just upset and mourning the fact that the only family that is going to survive him will eventually be you, and you don't even care to remember his existence.\n\nFairly so I might add, but I would indeed leave room for reconciliation open with your parents.  \nYou don't have to acknowledge the brother ever again though; that is simply the cost of how he treated you while you were alive. Any strain that puts on the relationship with your parents is more on them than yourself. It's pointless staying angry at a dead person though. If you are still angry at him then write an autobiography and drag his name through the mud there for any amateur historians of the future. The survivor gets to write the history.", "You don\u2019t owe your brother anything in life or death you need to do what is best for you.    You also don\u2019t need to understand anyone\u2019s point of view when they choose to let your brother dictate what contact they have with you.   It\u2019s very sad situation but your family have to live with the consequences of actions they choose \n\nNot many people attend funerals of people they wouldn\u2019t piss on if they where on fire", "Nta for not attending the funeral but you are for blocking parents.", "I'm a little confused. If your relationship was strained to the point you hadn't spoken in decades and you didn't attend his funeral, then why did you assume you'd be left anything in his will?\n\nAnd what was your argument with your parents about? Why does your brothers death change your relationship from Low Contact to No Contact? Not enough information here to make a judgement.", "NTA and TBH? Your parents are going to reach out to you for money.", "The first one. The second one was expected. He left everything he owned to my parents for the purpose of organizing their care and after my parents death,the stuff that has left will be distributed equally among the 4 charities he has chosen", "The OP has now mentioned that it was for not attending the funeral", "And he didn\u2019t leave you anything, showing how he saw you. He was the town darling, your parents weren\u2019t lacking for emotional support.", "Honestly,I don't know. It was just an instinct. I guess I wanted to say goodbye.", "I disagree, his parent are complicit in his brother ruining his childhood and early life. It does not matter what the argument was over. His Parents ultimately destroyed his early life on the instructions of their elder son.\n\nHe has every right to declare himself dead to them.", "Because they were complicit in the abuse he endured. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to boarding school.", "He specifically wanted that school. He believed I was a menace for his career and I would be basically locked down at that school. I wasn't allowed to leave the school grounds even in the summer and I was basically an inmate.", "NTA. I imagine it would be extremely awkward, uncomfortable and potentially traumatic going to his funeral. It might also be uncomfortable seeing extended family that you don\u2019t have any relationship with. If your parents can\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s a **them** problem. I\u2019m glad you are able to have a relationship with your husbands family.", "Blood is thicker than water", "Yta", "That's not the saying. It's the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Which means the fealty of pactmakers is stronger than familial bonds.\n\nFamily is chosen.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you mad at your parents for what your brother put in his will?\n\nIt sounds to me like you resent your brother for his influence on your parents, and your parents for the choices they made as a result - which is fair - but that you some how think this makes you entitled to money from your brother\u2019s estate and that\u2019s not how that works.\n\nLook if you had no relationship with your brother, it wouldn\u2019t have been wrong to skip the \u201crush to the bedside/attend the funeral\u201d ritual. Because he would have been a stranger to you.  Or someone you didn\u2019t like and that\u2019s fine. \n\nIf you went to support your parents, then I\u2019d say good on you despite them \u201ccaving\u201d on how the dealt with you based on his advice.\n\nBut declaring yourself \u201cdead\u201d to your parents - who you say you are trying to rebuild a relationship with and did just lose one of their sons - because your brother didn\u2019t leave you money definitely makes you in the wrong here.", "I don\u2019t get why you would rush to be by his side and be there when he died, but not go to the funeral. If only to support your parents. They buried their kid, that\u2019s one of the worst things that can happen to a parent. I\u2019ll never forget the sounds my grandma made when my mom called her and told her my dad (her son) died. The animalistic pain in those sounds. That you wouldn\u2019t go for your brother or for you is fine, but your parents\u2026. YTA", "NTA\n\nIt is one thing to have a large age gap and not be close, but it is clear that you were not supported and your brother was a large part of it. Maybe he didn't want to share your parents, I don't know and of course no one can ask him now.\n\nFunerals are for the living, and you probably said goodbye to him years ago. Plus you said you have strained relationships with extended family so it's doing them a favour.", "You are NTA but I do think you need more counselling/therapy. \n\nThe rage that people are seeing could be linked to the PTSD you experienced from your child, teenage and early adult years. You owe it to yourself to try and achieve some peace with that.", "YTA for clearly writing this in such a biased manner. If your behavior was bad enough to get sent to boarding school, it wasn\u2019t normal rebellious teenager behavior.", "Info: what was the fight about?\n\nETA: fight was about him attending. \nNTA. You had no relationship to him and you said he was a stranger. I don\u2019t know what they expected.", "NTA, there is a lot to unpack here I hope you get professional help to deal with your post trauma. Who cares if you get nothing from your (late) brother. Money is not important, but a loving family is worth the world. Get rid of toxic people", "NTA, but I'm stuck on the small town of 50,000...", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries and your brother caused you a lot of pain in your life. There\u2019s no obligation to attend the funeral of someone who did that to you. And if your parents don\u2019t like it, then they should reevaluate how they have treated you over the years (allowing your brother to influence their decisions as parents). You may decide to try to reopen contact with your parents someday, but I would hope that they respect your choices as an individual and realize that if they don\u2019t change their ways, they may very well lose you for good.", "NTA your parents not fighting your brother about sending you away and keeping their distance just because they were 'financially dependent' on him is really quite the sting. I get that they needed the money but to kowtow to one brother to that degree is definitely hurtful. Really sounds like your brother wanted you gone and he got what he wanted and it hurt your relationship with your parents on top of it.", "But why do you even want any money from a man who was never really in your life? Didn\u2019t you cut contact with him for a long, long time? Then why are you even expecting a dime from him? I don\u2019t understand this predicament..\nYTA", "This shit was written by AI. And poorly too.", "Also a small town of 50k? That'd a whole ass city", "I wouldn\u2019t say ruined his life she was rebellious and I guess was doing a lot because if not I doubt they would have agreed to send her to a boarding school", "He was married but his wife left him due to his work-life balance and it was swift(she was also a doctor if I am remembering right)", "It is not due to money. We had a fight because of my funeral decision. I haven't had any plans of getting a dime from him.He hated my guts and made it known to the public.", "My brother wanted me to send away because he was trying to get a position in our national health agency and I would be deemed a problem for him. By sending him away he looked like he had taken the appropriate measures.", "Some parents, especially when they have a child so late in life are more than happy to farm the kid out to someone else.", "Just as info,I haven't asked or expected anything but it was boldly written in his will. \n\nMy parents and I argued for not attending his funeral and at the last moment my father said \"Your brother was the best thing that could happen to us and you never understood that.\"So I went to NC.", "That. Is a stupid argument as wills are drafted before a death.  How would the brother know the sister didn\u2019t attend the funeral, he was dead in order for there to be a funeral.  I think this is just a writing assignment for someone. ,", "Right?? Where is that considered small, Beijing?", "We have no idea where he left his money to. Wife, kids, his parents. Why on earth would he leave anything to a sibling? My husband received nothing when his sister died and they were super close. I expect to receive nothing when my siblings die, why would I?", "In my similar situation I eventually came to understand that there is always a hope that this time things will be different. The sadness of the death was actually sadness at the knowledge that it was never going to be different.", "I would\n\n\"Sent to a troubled-kid school on the other side of the country, I faced immense trauma, leading to a year of inpatient therapy after high school.\" \n\nThat school I suspect was a Military academy not a nice boarding school. No wonder OP was traumatised and had to spend a year in residential therapy. American Military Academies are not good places.", "OP is male.", "Well given that you literally said you\u2019d skipped the funeral, found out you weren\u2019t getting anything, then had a big fight with your parents and cut them off, it seemed you were saying the fight was caused by the discovery you weren\u2019t in the will.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear to me why you had a huge fight with your parents ta that led to your decision, so I can\u2019t say if you were in the right or the wrong.", "Why would he need to take \"appropriate measures\" when he wasn't your father?", "OP says the had a juvenile record, it sounds like OP was on a very bad path and needed some serious help.", "And some parents are desperate to do anything to help their child who is struggling and rejects other options. We have no way of know which one it was.", "Ok well then well that makes it clear. Obviously NTA for going No Contact.", "Your parents are just as guilty as your brother. They didn\u2019t know what to do with you, so they listened to your brother instead of being the parents you needed. You did the minimum by seeing him in the hospital. Good riddance.", "You didn\u2019t answer the part about what \u201crebellious teenager\u201d means. Hard to make much of a judgement without that information.", "I think they meant that the reason for the fight with parents was OP not attending the funeral, and the fight brought up a lot of anger.", "OP is male.", "> How would the brother know the sister\n\n>I (32M)", "Plus he convinced them to ship him across the country. Of course he didn\u2019t plan to leave him anything. Sounds like he would have tried to charge him something in his will.", "I can understand that reasoning", "The fight started because I  wasn't at the funeral and ended with the sentence my dad said \"Your brother was a blessing to us and you will never understand it.\"", "It's kind of complicated but my brother started his career.as the head of vaccinations in our area and he has a security investigation before starting his job and he was \"advised\" to get rid of me.", "You should really educate yourself on the \u201ctroubled teen\u201d industry and the trauma it causes young children.", "And not be allowed home during holidays because of his reputation.", "That isn't true. Blood is thicker than water is the original saying and it means - as you might expect -  that family should come first. Sense to be attributed to a [12th century German saying](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_is_thicker_than_water).The blood of the covenant/womb water saying came about after as people wanted something different.", "You should seriously reconsider how you worded your post then.", "In all frankness this sounds a lot like BS to me. I worked with kids, including medically and mentally vulnerable ones, and never has the mental state of my family come up. Granted, this might be a case of different country different rules but it feels like a power play on your brother's part since he was paying for your parents' lifestyle by then.", "I mean, if you read OPs replies you\u2019d see that they were physically violent, driving drunk before they could even legally drive and running away. That\u2019s not \u201ctroubled teen\u201d industry, that\u2019s someone who needed serious help that no one who isn\u2019t a professional is equipped to handle.", "Yes, the family that you *choose*. The bonds we choose to make of our own volition far trump any supposed obligation via genetic proximity.", "My main language isn't English so I might have written really weird.", "I had a juvenile record,it was the problem.", "Well clearly whatever facility they were sent to did more harm than good. They\u2019re no longer a kid and said they have trauma from that situation. What helps a \u201ctroubled teen\u201d isn\u2019t disrupting their life and sending them to the opposite side of the country away from everything they know. In fact that may exacerbate their issues.", "Yeah that's fine! I agree with that even though I'm fortunate that I also am able to choose my \"genetic\" family as family as they're cool. \n\nBut it's not the original saying or meaning. The original saying meant that genetic family comes first. It's okay not to subscribe to that belief! But the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb thing is a far more recent invention.", "What did you have a juvenile record for?", "Again, that should not reflect on your brother because he's not you, your parent nor your guardian. And again, I had to have enhanced disclosures for work and it was entirely about my background, nothing about anyone I might be living with at the time that I am not responsible for.", "Or OP is refusing to take any responsibility and blames his brother for things that the brother couldn\u2019t control.", "No, the original did not mean that. The original saying is about the blood of the covenant. It's from the Bible and it's about agreements made over an animal sacrifice, ergo the blood. Google exists, it's not hard to use. Stop being willfully ignorant.", "I have stolen and crashed my father's motorbike to the school while I was drunk and I kicked the shit out of the vice principal after it. I deeply regret both of these. Before that I was known to run away from the house.", "Starting to think OP might not be his parent's direct kid at this point. Could 'big brother' be his actual father perhaps?", "I know someone whose husband works at a government facility in the US. Their son (early 20s) was seeing a drug addict a couple years ago and they had to have the son move out because having him stay at home with his parents would risk the friend's husband's security clearance.", "Yeah. They stole their fathers motorbike (while drunk), repeatedly ran away, and also violently assaulted their vice principal. Something tells me it may not have been the boarding school that messed this kid up.", "I have googled and provided a link in my comment. It's not from the Bible and you are the one who is wrong. Provide me a source or stop arguing.", "I mean, quite frankly it sounds like you\u2019re blaming your brother for your dangerous behavior as a teenager. That wasn\u2019t \u201crebellious teenage behavior\u201d. That is dangerous behavior and I don\u2019t blame your parents for sending you to a school equipped to handle that. You need to take accountability and stop blaming others.", "The age gap makes it certainly possible. It would explain this hole in the assertion too.", "Making their adult **son** who lived with them move out makes sense because there\u2019s a strong likelihood that the drug addict gf is also in their shared home regularly. I doubt OPs brother still lived at home at that age but he could have certainly moved out much easier than convincing his parents to have his brother institutionalized. \n\nI don\u2019t see how a teenage brother with a sealed juvenile record could even be a factor in getting this type of job. It doesn\u2019t ring true.", "The problem was that school.There were multiple facilities that weren't on the other side of the country (a 10 hour ride) and there were also programs offered that were of the same quality,even better maybe while managing to be a part of that family. I was neglected and isolated. During my school time I have been evaluated as high fleet risk even though I wasn't after age 15 and I was always kept isolated from the whole school.", "Easy to hide as well, if brother and (grand?) father share a name, most forms wont detail their date of birth anyway.\n\nEntirely possible the brother was just a massive asshole instead, but this backstory made me wonder."]}
