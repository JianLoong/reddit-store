And the fact that you\u2019ve taken the opportunity to make your brother\u2019s tragic death somehow all about you suggests your parent are probably right. But they way you\u2019ve written this it\u2019s rather confusing. So who knows?", "NTA, but you maybe citing too hastily in a time of extreme stress. Give yourself time to settle down and reassess.

He was less than a stranger to you, bringing only detriment into your life and you don't go to the funeral of every acquaintance that disliked you. They literally stopped being reliant on him the moment that he passed, and if he left everything to them then I assume he didn't have kids himself? They are likely just upset and mourning the fact that the only family that is going to survive him will eventually be you, and you don't even care to remember his existence.\n\nFairly so I might add, but I would indeed leave room for reconciliation open with your parents.  \nYou don't have to acknowledge the brother ever again though; that is simply the cost of how he treated you while you were alive. Any strain that puts on the relationship with your parents is more on them than yourself. It's pointless staying angry at a dead person though. If you are still angry at him then write an autobiography and drag his name through the mud there for any amateur historians of the future.

I\u2019ll never forget the sounds my grandma made when my mom called her and told her my dad (her son) died. The animalistic pain in those sounds.

Maybe he didn't want to share your parents, I don't know and of course no one can ask him now.\n\nFunerals are for the living, and you probably said goodbye to him years ago. Plus you said you have strained relationships with extended family so it's doing them a favour.", "You are NTA but I do think you need more counselling/therapy. \n\nThe rage that people are seeing could be linked to the PTSD you experienced from your child, teenage and early adult years. You owe it to yourself to try and achieve some peace with that.", "YTA for clearly writing this in such a biased manner.

I worked with kids, including medically and mentally vulnerable ones, and never has the mental state of my family come up. Granted, this might be a case of different country different rules but it feels like a power play on your brother's part since he was paying for your parents' lifestyle by then.", "I mean, if you read OPs replies you\u2019d see that they were physically violent, driving drunk before they could even legally drive and running away. That\u2019s not \u201ctroubled teen\u201d industry, that\u2019s someone who needed serious help that no one who isn\u2019t a professional is equipped to handle.", "Yes, the family that you *choose*.

The original saying is about the blood of the covenant. It's from the Bible and it's about agreements made over an animal sacrifice, ergo the blood. Google exists, it's not hard to use.

Something tells me it may not have been the boarding school that messed this kid up.", "I have googled and provided a link in my comment. It's not from the Bible and you are the one who is wrong. Provide me a source or stop arguing.", "I mean, quite frankly it sounds like you\u2019re blaming your brother for your dangerous behavior as a teenager. That wasn\u2019t \u201crebellious teenage behavior\u201d. That is dangerous behavior and I don\u2019t blame your parents for sending you to a school equipped to handle that. You need to take accountability and stop blaming others.", "The age gap makes it certainly possible. It would explain this hole in the assertion too.", "Making their adult **son** who lived with them move out makes sense because there\u2019s a strong likelihood that the drug addict gf is also in their shared home regularly. I doubt OPs brother still lived at home at that age but he could have certainly moved out much easier than convincing his parents to have his brother institutionalized. \n\nI don\u2019t see how a teenage brother with a sealed juvenile record could even be a factor in getting this type of job. It doesn\u2019t ring true.", "The problem was that school.There were multiple facilities that weren't on the other side of the country (a 10 hour ride) and there were also programs offered that were of the same quality,even better maybe while managing to be a part of that family.

They were the ones responsible for you, and they failed to keep you from doing that. You were a child. Part of being responsible parents is making sure your kids don\u2019t have access to alcohol or vehicles. It was their job to say \u201cno,\u201d to your brother\u2019s ridiculous demands about your schooling. It was their job to protect you and raise you, and instead they shipped you off somewhere and gave your brother legal custody. That\u2019s terrible, awful parenting. He should never have been put in that position either. You don\u2019t get to foist your children off onto other people and wash your hands of them, that isn\u2019t how the world works.

Whenever you hear of a kid so out of control that the parents send them away, it\u2019s usually because they actually have worked pretty damn hard to earn it. I don\u2019t know what happened, but there is a pretty damn good chance they sent OP to boarding t school for very good reasons.", "How was he failed?

It's a matter of what you're used to. After spending >30 years in places of at least a million, 50k is a major change.", "Almost exactly the population of my home town and I very much consider it to be a town not a city. 50k is a tiny cluster of \"downtown\" city blocks with some basic attractions like museums and theater. But everything surrounding it is just suburbs and it really lacks the larger substantive features that come with a major metro area\n\nTho both parking and housing are several times more expensive in that small town than they are in my very nice larger metro now.", "No it isn't, cities usually have hundreds of thousands. Towns have tens of thousands, villages have thousands (or occasionally less, but there's not many smaller settlements with a church).\n\nAt least that's the case in England, and it'll be similar across northern Europe.

OP\u2019s brother brought it to his parents so that OP would be sent far away. OP no where blames his behavior on anyone. He is rightfully upset with his parents for listening to his brother and also his parents for just basically putting him there by himself where he experienced traumas.. his parents were like \u201cwe have one good son, let\u2019s put the bad one somewhere far so we don\u2019t have to deal\u201d he was 14.. a literally kid when he was sent away. Remember that.", "Dated a dude nicknamed \"hippie\" because he always wore sandals or was barefoot.

He did all of those things that\u2019s a fact.. while he was a kid.. 14. His parents could have guess what, PARENTED and found a closer school or program to help him. But instead they sent him ACROSS THE COUNTRY and basically hoped that the school would fix him and washed themselves clean of him. HE WAS ABANDONED. Period. He nowhere blames ANY of his behavior on ANYONE. \n\nOP,s father told OP \u201cyou\u2019ll never understand what a blessing your brother was to you\u201d \n\nOPs brother helped get him sent away, never treated him like a brother.. but he\u2019s a blessing ? Interesting. \n\nOP\u2019s feelings are valid. His parents chose his brothers comfort over OPs well being. & mind you when they choose the brother over OP, OP was 14 (a minor) and the brother was an ADULT.\n\nI hope if you ever found yourself in sticky interpersonal relationship issues, that those in your life are able to help you see other perspectives, and not just one perspective/ side, like it seems you only know how to do."]}
