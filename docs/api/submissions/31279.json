You didn\u2019t go to your brother\u2019s funeral and your parents think YTA because of that, or are you saying your brother should be the AH because he left you out of his will?\n\nAssuming your brother has family and kids it\u2019s not at all surprising he left you out of the will. And the fact that you\u2019ve taken the opportunity to make your brother\u2019s tragic death somehow all about you suggests your parent are probably right. But they way you\u2019ve written this it\u2019s rather confusing. So who knows?", "NTA, but you maybe citing too hastily in a time of extreme stress. Give yourself time to settle down and reassess. But don\u2019t feel bad for skipping the funeral - your brother was the source of a lot of trauma in your life.", "Yta. Why declare yourself dead to your parents? Are you mad they were upset you didn\u2019t attend the funeral? Are you punishing them for your brother being left out of the will? There seem to be something else going on here. I hope you have someone to talk to and that you can work through things and restore the relationshi with your parents", "Is this real? Why would you expect anything in your brother\u2019s will? And he included a proviso if you didn\u2019t attend his funeral you would be cut from his will? Not buying it.", "Why would you want something from his will? You didn\u2019t get along so that makes no sense", "What do you mean when you say \u201crebellious teenager\u201d? also your brother wanted you to go to a boarding school or a troubled kid school? Not TA for skipping the funeral but YTA for expecting anything from your brothers will.", "Your husband and in-laws don't understand because they aren't arseholes and seemingly haven't been raised or related to arseholes.\n\nThis is the reality of being a cycle-breaker. Someone who steps away from the toxicity and ends the psychological violence. I'm sorry you were the forgotten child and you did deserve reparations. Take peace in that he cannot hurt you anymore and keep your parents on block. What a pack of arseholes they are. NTA.", "From the comments I see the argument was just about the funeral and not that you were expecting some inheritance.   \nNTA. He was less than a stranger to you, bringing only detriment into your life and you don't go to the funeral of every acquaintance that disliked you. They literally stopped being reliant on him the moment that he passed, and if he left everything to them then I assume he didn't have kids himself? They are likely just upset and mourning the fact that the only family that is going to survive him will eventually be you, and you don't even care to remember his existence.\n\nFairly so I might add, but I would indeed leave room for reconciliation open with your parents.  \nYou don't have to acknowledge the brother ever again though; that is simply the cost of how he treated you while you were alive. Any strain that puts on the relationship with your parents is more on them than yourself. It's pointless staying angry at a dead person though. If you are still angry at him then write an autobiography and drag his name through the mud there for any amateur historians of the future. The survivor gets to write the history.", "You don\u2019t owe your brother anything in life or death you need to do what is best for you.    You also don\u2019t need to understand anyone\u2019s point of view when they choose to let your brother dictate what contact they have with you.   It\u2019s very sad situation but your family have to live with the consequences of actions they choose \n\nNot many people attend funerals of people they wouldn\u2019t piss on if they where on fire", "Nta for not attending the funeral but you are for blocking parents.", "I'm a little confused. If your relationship was strained to the point you hadn't spoken in decades and you didn't attend his funeral, then why did you assume you'd be left anything in his will?\n\nAnd what was your argument with your parents about? Why does your brothers death change your relationship from Low Contact to No Contact? Not enough information here to make a judgement.", "NTA and TBH? Your parents are going to reach out to you for money.", "The first one. The second one was expected. He left everything he owned to my parents for the purpose of organizing their care and after my parents death,the stuff that has left will be distributed equally among the 4 charities he has chosen", "The OP has now mentioned that it was for not attending the funeral", "And he didn\u2019t leave you anything, showing how he saw you. He was the town darling, your parents weren\u2019t lacking for emotional support.", "Honestly,I don't know. It was just an instinct. I guess I wanted to say goodbye.", "I disagree, his parent are complicit in his brother ruining his childhood and early life. It does not matter what the argument was over. His Parents ultimately destroyed his early life on the instructions of their elder son.\n\nHe has every right to declare himself dead to them.", "Because they were complicit in the abuse he endured. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to boarding school.", "He specifically wanted that school. He believed I was a menace for his career and I would be basically locked down at that school. I wasn't allowed to leave the school grounds even in the summer and I was basically an inmate.", "NTA. I imagine it would be extremely awkward, uncomfortable and potentially traumatic going to his funeral. It might also be uncomfortable seeing extended family that you don\u2019t have any relationship with. If your parents can\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s a **them** problem. I\u2019m glad you are able to have a relationship with your husbands family.", "Blood is thicker than water", "Yta", "That's not the saying. It's the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Which means the fealty of pactmakers is stronger than familial bonds.\n\nFamily is chosen."]}
