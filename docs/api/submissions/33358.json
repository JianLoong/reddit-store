There's nothing funny about giving alcohol to someone who doesn't drink.\n\nQuestion, though. Are you struggling to stay sober? Because if you're not, there's no reason you can't go to the work socials. Bars & pubs will serve virgin drinks and there's lots of mocktails that taste as good as or better than cocktails. That way you won't lose it on the social aspect you seem to have enjoyed. (If you are struggling to stay sober, this isn't a good idea, obviously.)", "NTA. The way society treats people who choose to be sober is depressing, coming from someone who DOES drink. Seriously.

People think you\u2019re boring or too uptight if you don\u2019t drink. Naur. As someone who does drink, you deserve a space that\u2019s free from it.

It was a very rude and thoughtless gift.", "NTA. I agree with people who are saying there may have been gentler ways to handle this, but pouring it out certainly drives your point home. If you had taken it home to give to someone else and not made a scene, it would have looked like you fully accepted the gift and they would all likely assume you weren't serious about your sobriety, which would then make your abstention from the pub socials all the more difficult and awkward. Maybe you could've given it to another coworker, but even that would've appeared ungrateful and only slightly less dramatic unless you did so quietly, which would carry the same risks as taking it home to regift. \n\nYour coworker put you in a no win situation and directly challenged your sobriety efforts at a time where you're already feeling left out.

Maybe if a diehard Red Meat 4 Lyfe person who got Lyme disease and couldn't eat steak anymore got Omaha steaks it'd be similar, but giving up alcohol is *hard*, even for non-alcoholics. It's SO easy to just have a casual glass, or just one beer, that both your brain and other people are convinced it doesn't have to be no alcohol - just one! And if OP drank quite a lot, her brain will be missing it quite badly I imagine.", "I agree.  It was just the closest example I could think of without going into illicit drugs.  I am an alcoholic and no full well I can't have just one.  My work has a unspoken rule that most business dinners unless they are at a convention center, we have a two drink max and I never drink at them at all.  I am also a diehard Red Meat 4 Lyfe person, without the Lyme disease.  When I quit drinking, I went on a carnivore diet for four months and went from 250 to 185 while maintaining the same activity level."]}
