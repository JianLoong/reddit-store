There's nothing funny about giving alcohol to someone who doesn't drink.\n\nQuestion, though. Are you struggling to stay sober? Because if you're not, there's no reason you can't go to the work socials. Bars & pubs will serve virgin drinks and there's lots of mocktails that taste as good as or better than cocktails. That way you won't lose it on the social aspect you seem to have enjoyed. (If you are struggling to stay sober, this isn't a good idea, obviously.)", "NTA. The way society treats people who choose to be sober is depressing, coming from someone who DOES drink. Seriously. Breweries popping up left and right in my town and it\u2019s like people don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to do as a young person except drink. People think you\u2019re boring or too uptight if you don\u2019t drink. Naur. As someone who does drink, you deserve a space that\u2019s free from it. Work should be one of those places.\n\nNext time to avoid conflict I wouldn\u2019t pour it with witnesses or anyone who can see. I would tell Anna \u201cthanks this will be a great gift for my friend!\u201d and hit her with the \u201cI don\u2019t drink, but I know people who do and they will appreciate your forethought as much as I do.\u201d Then dump it when you\u2019re alone.\n\nYour friends aren\u2019t saying anything bc it\u2019s awkward, most likely. You\u2019d have to be downright cruel and self-serving to jeer at a sober person for not accepting a drink.", "NTA, and congratulations on your sobriety. Your coworker can go kick rocks.", "Nta - a tad overdramatic and wasteful (you could of just left it there for someone else to take or regifted it), but I get it. It was a very rude and thoughtless gift.", "NTA. I agree with people who are saying there may have been gentler ways to handle this, but pouring it out certainly drives your point home. If you had taken it home to give to someone else and not made a scene, it would have looked like you fully accepted the gift and they would all likely assume you weren't serious about your sobriety, which would then make your abstention from the pub socials all the more difficult and awkward. Maybe you could've given it to another coworker, but even that would've appeared ungrateful and only slightly less dramatic unless you did so quietly, which would carry the same risks as taking it home to regift. \n\nYour coworker put you in a no win situation and directly challenged your sobriety efforts at a time where you're already feeling left out. Her actions were very unkind, to put it politely. You may experience some fallout from your choice but hold your head high.", "NTA. How is that a joke", "Nta jokes are supposed to be funny", "NTA.", "Nta but you did tell her you worked it out or at least implied it when you, rightfully so, told Anna you were upset About the wine", "There's an old saying: \"misery loves company\". You meet a lot of these people when you get sober, who really want to convince you to drink again. I've learned to not give them the satisfaction of getting upset about it. Make it as boring as possible for them.", "NTA, but next time just say you don't appreciate the gift and ask how is the joke supposed to be funny, zero way any reasonable person would try to label you AH and you get to see an actual AH scramble trying to figure out how to say \"I'm making fun of your sobriety\"", "Yeah no looking back I think maybe pouring it out in the sink was over the top, I was just sick of her not taking me going sober seriously, as we\u2019ve already had a private conversation about it and she cut it out then, so I was just surprised she would gift me something like that in front of the group knowing I would open it in front of everyone.", "I can see that point with the drinkers loss but I would like to add \"Gift giving\" is seen as something inherently nice, so people who dislike their gifts or throw them away are immediately seen as rude. \n\nEspecially on Christmas anyone who is unhappy with what they receive are immediately \"entitled\".", "Fuck them then. You don't give people who quit drinking alcohol as a gift.", "What a sad waste of a gram of coke. You could have at least given it to another addict", "What does that matter?", "Honestly, this is a very valid question.\n\n\"Wow, I should drink less\" does not equal \"I need enthusiastic public support.\"\n\nNor does 'Huh, I just had liver cancer and now I can't drink anymore, oh well.'", "While this is true, we have a shitty drinking culture in the UK, especially over Xmas. Binge drinking is a widespread problem, and if you tell your friends you don't drink, they treat you like you've grown an extra head or something \ud83d\ude12\n\nIt's better nowadays, but I still remember the time I told then college friends I just didn't want to drink, and people were incredulous. My favourite was being asked \"so how do you get drunk\u203d\" Like, that's the whole point of *not* drinking, genius \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb", "A bit over the top.

It's a shitty joke and guarantees that you get nothing out of the group activity, because now you're the only one with no gift.", "If OP does not drink for health reasons, then OP could have kept thr bottle and served it to guests.  If OP quit because of an addiction, then they should not have the wine around them.", "Oh we have a shitty drinking culture in the US too, albeit a slightly different one. That's why my suggestion isn't a good idea for someone struggling at all with staying sober. But if you're not struggling with it, a lot of people don't even know you're not drinking when you order a mocktail. Of course, that won't stop supposedly close friends from being assholes, but it will stop most of the comments."]}
