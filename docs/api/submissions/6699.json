I have two siblings (37m and 32f) who are getting a 1/3rd share of the net estate along with me, but they are not executors. The problem is, in addition to money I also have to deal with his funeral arrangements and those are problematic. My dad was a jazz connoisseur bordering on historian, he had a massive record collection, jazz books, collectibles including instruments etc. For most of his adult life but especially in retirement it was his number one passion. His work as investment banker made him comfortable in retirement and especially after my mom's death he really became obsessive, he even wrote a book about lost jazz recordings, and probably spent around half of his retirement funds on collecting, travel, etc. related to this. This brings me to his funeral: he wants a \"jazz funeral\" with a marching band playing jazz standards escorting him from the chapel to the graveside. He has funds specifically earmarked in his trust for this and his will and trust make this direction very clear. I don't feel that I can honor this wish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all intents and purpose my dad was a white guy. Technically he is partly of Syrian descent and also of Jewish heritage but he was absolutely white passing and clearly benefitted enormously from white privilege. My partner (40M) is a person of color and told me that he would absolutely consider a jazz funeral to be cultural appropriation not only of Black culture but also of New Orleans, a place where we do not live and other than my dad's trips their for his jazz hobby, no connection. I am concerned that honoring this wish will humiliate my family, lead to accusations of racism against me and my late father, and ruin the occasion. I explained this to my brother and sister and even brought my partner into the conversation to give his perspective as a person of color but they are adamant that I should have the jazz funeral. My brother even called around to a few university music departments and to a high school my dad donated instruments to. All of them are happy to do the jazz funeral and the high school even offered to do it for free. My sister sent me the website of New Orleans group that will even fly in for the funeral provided we pay enough money, and apparently does this regularly. My siblings are trying to use this to argue that this is proof it is not cultural appropriation, since Black musicians are willing to perform, but given we live in late-capitalism I'm not sure being willing to do something for money is really proof someone wants to do it or feels it is ethical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point my brother has basically told me that there will be a band at the funeral whether I like it or not and he will pay for it personally. I told him that if he does that he will be asked to leave and that I will go no-contact with him from that point on as it would be a betrayal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I let the funeral proceed without a jazz marching band?", "created_utc": 1673062780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105eqph/wibta_if_i_dont_honor_my_dads_final_wishes/", "score": 246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, since he does have a very strong connection to the high school, I would have them do it and give a donation to the band program in his name (for whatever he allotted to his funeral). Since collected a lot of albums and etc, I would also find a Jazz museum or a Black History Museum to donate those to. Whether or not he could pass for white, whether or not he benefited from white privilege, he was a POC and he was passionate about jazz. \n\nBTW, your siblings can sue you for not following the requirements of the trust, and you're needlessly creating friction by threatening your brother.

Not only do you not want to honor your dad\u2019s will, but you want to go *no contact* with and remove your sibling from the funeral for being willing to do what you won\u2019t??

They are meant to celebrate the life of the one who passed. \n\nIf you\u2019re super concerned, hire a jazz band from New Orleans that can give a real true New Orleans second line celebration!

Some of the most famous jazz players are white. Black people and new orleans does not own jazz.

He is not mocking jazz or belittling it in anyway. More that anything jazz was a part of his life and he supported and shared his experience with everyone.

They could also very well contest you as the executor of the will if you don\u2019t do what is legally required according to the will.  You\u2019re legally responsible for abiding by it. \n\nThe problem with \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is that it in and of itself is a form of division, discrimination and racismin the way your bf is using and exploiting it. Everyone like your AH bf thinks that any thing and every thing that has any minority origin is automatically cultural appropriation if someone of a majority group adopts or likes something from their culture - No matter what it is and how they embrace it. And THAT IS WRONG! That\u2019s absolutely not the meaning. \n\nIn fact, by definition, cultural appropriation ONLY occurs when a majority group adopts elements of a minority group and uses it in an exploitative, disrespectful or stereotypical manner.  \n\nA white man loving Jazz music and wanting it at his funeral is not exploitative, disrespectful of Black heritage, nor is it stereotyping the black culture. He\u2019s embracing it and giving a nod to their genre of music. That\u2019s appreciation and respect for the genre and artists who made the music. So It\u2019s not cultural appropriation. \nYour bf needs to know his terms before he claims stuff and you need to do your own research before you believe everything he says. His \u201cblack\u201d agenda claiming everything is \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d and saying the majority cannot do anything that is from a minority origin is also a form of racism and discrimination (in reverse)- meaning he\u2019s a black man discriminating against white people.", "YTA", "YTA you dad loved Jazz, what more is there to say, it was his final wish...

I have two siblings (37m and 32f) who are getting a 1/3rd share of the net estate along with me, but they are not executors. The problem is, in addition to money I also have to deal with his funeral arrangements and those are problematic. My dad was a jazz connoisseur bordering on historian, he had a massive record collection, jazz books, collectibles including instruments etc. For most of his adult life but especially in retirement it was his number one passion. His work as investment banker made him comfortable in retirement and especially after my mom's death he really became obsessive, he even wrote a book about lost jazz recordings, and probably spent around half of his retirement funds on collecting, travel, etc. related to this. This brings me to his funeral: he wants a \"jazz funeral\" with a marching band playing jazz standards escorting him from the chapel to the graveside. He has funds specifically earmarked in his trust for this and his will and trust make this direction very clear. I don't feel that I can honor this wish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all intents and purpose my dad was a white guy. Technically he is partly of Syrian descent and also of Jewish heritage but he was absolutely white passing and clearly benefitted enormously from white privilege. My partner (40M) is a person of color and told me that he would absolutely consider a jazz funeral to be cultural appropriation not only of Black culture but also of New Orleans, a place where we do not live and other than my dad's trips their for his jazz hobby, no connection. I am concerned that honoring this wish will humiliate my family, lead to accusations of racism against me and my late father, and ruin the occasion. I explained this to my brother and sister and even brought my partner into the conversation to give his perspective as a person of color but they are adamant that I should have the jazz funeral. My brother even called around to a few university music departments and to a high school my dad donated instruments to. All of them are happy to do the jazz funeral and the high school even offered to do it for free. My sister sent me the website of New Orleans group that will even fly in for the funeral provided we pay enough money, and apparently does this regularly. My siblings are trying to use this to argue that this is proof it is not cultural appropriation, since Black musicians are willing to perform, but given we live in late-capitalism I'm not sure being willing to do something for money is really proof someone wants to do it or feels it is ethical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point my brother has basically told me that there will be a band at the funeral whether I like it or not and he will pay for it personally. I told him that if he does that he will be asked to leave and that I will go no-contact with him from that point on as it would be a betrayal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I let the funeral proceed without a jazz marching band?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My role as executor is not to determine where estate funds go. It's to ensure estate funds are doled out in alignment with the deceased person's wishes, as expressed in a will, trust etc. I think your NOT giving your dad a jazz funeral might be as contestable as your refusing to give Great Aunt Harriet her bequest.

A white person hiring a jazz band is NOT cultural appropriation. Is a white person buying and reading the works of Toni Morrison cultural appropriation? How about a white person going to a Mexican restaurant? No? Then hiring a jazz band isn't cultural appropriation either. IMHO, cultural appropriation would be your dad getting a bunch of his white friends together and advertising themselves as \"Straight from Bourbon Street ...

Also, Vikings had a hairdo similar to dreads but the name and technique are a bit different.", "Bruh... take a deep breath. Nobody attacked you, you don't have to be so upset.", "Bringing up the history of Jewish ppl & jazz is more to demonstrate how it seems like op\u2019s partner doesn\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re talking about, not saying that if he wasn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t be ok.", "Also very fair point, Vikings were incredibly diverse and just cause you have Norwegian ancestry does not mean your ancestors were Vikings. But yes Vikings used braids, however they were not dreads at all", "Yeah sure, the Nordic people weren't white  \n\n\nThere might have been ONE black viking, the same way there was 1 black Samurai, but it most definitely not enough to make any point of argument. Its fine to big up your race, but don't make up bullshit lies to go \"see black people were everywhere and in huge numbers, white people did jack shit\"", "Producing scholarly works about jazz is also a legitimate, significant contribution to the community as a whole.", "I agree. It was more of a \"food for thought\" thing than anything. My brother is white and plays in a jazz band that frequently does second lines. He plays with jazz musicians of color pretty frequently and marches in Mardi Gras parades with them. He's never had one of them say he is culturally appropriating.", "I think its fair to push back against the online narrative that everythong cool comes from black people. You have morons claiming beethoven was black.", "Thanks bruh!", "\nWhy would be saying that there was Black people among the Vikings bigging up one's race? Why would having diversity something to diminish white people?\n\nI'm not Black, why are you assuming and also accusing me of lying? I based what I said in some relatively recent studies being published and making it to the news.", "There's pushing back and there's freaking out in am immature way", "Good one", "No, bruh, I sincerely mean it, bruh!", "But but but! She might get called racist!", "Teenager", "Good one"]}
