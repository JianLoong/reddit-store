For most of my life, she has had a pretty serious drinking & drug problem (i.e. disappearing for days to do crack). In 2018, I was diagnosed and treated for CPTSD bc of the way her actions impacted me. Now, I'm happily married with a toddler daughter and another on the way. \n\nMy mom has chilled out a lot thanks to finding the right medication. Although she still likes her drink. I told her about the way her behavior has deeply hurt me, and she was remorseful and apologetic. \n\nLast year, I asked her to be my nanny. I paid her $2,500/mo to watch my kid 4-5 days/ week while I WFH and sometimes she would stay on the weekends so we could go out. \n\nHer drinking makes me uncomfortable and triggers my anxiety big time. When she would stay over, she would often get a 12-pack delivered and drink the whole thing.\n\nI've told her a few times I don't want to be around her drinking and I don't want her to drink while she is responsible for my kid. She said she understands, but the problem persisted. Since this behavior peaks my anxiety, I would often get snippy and short with her. \n\nIt all came to a head\n\n. My husband and I were going to see 3 nights of our favorite band in another state where my aunt lives. Originally, we were going to leave mom and kid at home. We brought them both so they could spend time with my aunt. We set a clear expectation that my mom would only drink the first night before the concerts and that she would wake up every morning by 9 to take over toddler duties.\n\nWhat happened was that she drank a 12-pack every night, never woke up before 11and never took over toddler duties. In the evenings while we were gone, my aunt watched my kid. \n\nOn night 3 of the concerts, I got a fever and couldn't go. My aunt had other plans and left. I came upstairs to find my mom drinking again and playing with my daughter. When confronted, she told me that she doesn't think her drinking is a big deal and that I'm an adult now, and I need to get over it. That just bc she couldn't drive a car doesn't mean she can't watch a toddler. Basically implying that my feelings are not valid and that I'm too hard on her.\n\nThat was 4 weeks ago. Since then, I'm back in therapy bc of the way this is tormenting me. My kid is in daycare. \n\nMy mom has sent a few texts indicating she does not think she has done any wrong. I feel like I can't be around someone who doesn't respect my boundaries. She asked if she could facetime my kid and I told her we need space. She told me that I'm being cruel for keeping my toddler from her saying \"I should have known you would do this to me.\"\n\nI don't know that I want to cut off contact with her forever, but I do know that I'm not ready to talk to her and I don't want her as my childcare anymore. Any ounce of remorse would make me feel more inclined to facetime with her, but I don't think that is coming any time soon. \n\nSo, AITA?

No comment on the FaceTime.  But you let an alcoholic watch your toddler?  When she showed you time and time again that she was drunk while watching your child?!\n\nAs Pam from the office said, \u201cWhen a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, you don't blame the child; he didn't know any better.

And leaves the baby alone with this woman repeatedly!\n\nWhy on earth would you deliberately choose this person to be your baby's caregiver, knowing that she left you permanently traumatized from your own childhood? You state that you have had ongoing trust issues with her this entire time. What on earth were you thinking asking her to be responsible for your child's well-being, even with you in the house, much less leaving your toddler alone with her on the weekends while you went out? She should have been the LAST person you would choose to watch your kid. It's like you don't care about their safety at all! JFC.\n\nOP, your mother is an AH for all the obvious reasons, but your judgement is just as severely impaired if you're asking her to be your child's caregiver knowing that she is an irresponsible alcoholic who can't be trusted, and your only safety precaution despite all of this is repeatedly telling her, \"Don't be like that anymore,\" and believing her when she says she won't, despite a literally LIFETIME of evidence that she can't be trusted.

Now, you are upset because she followed the same pattern of behavior, this time around your children. You let the cycle continue, and u need to stop it. Stop it for you, stop it for your kids. She\u2019s an addict and HAS BEEN, you KNEW this, and let an addict watch your children ALONE quite often. You\u2019re NTA for saying no, but ESH because u knew the entire time what was going on. U knew asking her to stop wouldn\u2019t do any good whatsoever, and u still rewarded her with your kids and a check. Don\u2019t let her near your kids alone again, before they have issues with YOU when they\u2019re older that stem from your childhood issues with your mother.", "You let a drunk babysit your kids?", "ESH\n\nNow, why would you hire your mother, the source of your childhood trauma, to nanny your children?

Your mom is TA for the obvious.", "I don't think you think YTA.  I think you're looking for advice on how to handle this situation and that's fine.   \n\n\nThink about it this way:  If you hired a regular nanny - and found that she'd been drinking a 12-pack while looking after your kid - wouldn't you fire her on the spot?  \n\n\nIt shouldn't be different from your mom.  You know from first hand experience what addiction does to kids.  You have every right to set boundaries.  You have a right to let her know that she's not welcome around your children until she gives it up.  This is a safety issue.", ">When confronted, she told me that she doesn't think her drinking is a big deal and that I'm an adult now, and I need to get over it.\n\nOr, and I'm just spitballing ideas here, she can be an adult and not drink all the time while around a toddler who's mother told her not to.

This is the safety of your child we are talking about.

You need to stop listening to her and you need to stop explaining. She's gone WAY over the mark and is in NO place to attempt to negotiate any kind of terms.\n\nYour duty of care is to your child, not your mother.\n\nYou are NTA for saying no to the FaceTime. It's the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, you need to seriously sharpen up your NC with her. You need a break from this eternal pantomime and you need time to consider your relationship and your child's relationship with your mother going forward. Unsupervised should NEVER be an option after this. Personally, I would be seriously considering any kind of relationship after this.

If something bad happened because she was drinking, how would you feel?", "NTA. You set a clear boundary, your mother agreed to it, and then she violated it. If any other person you hired/asked to care for your child did these things, would you hesitate to switch providers?", "NTA. Your mother is an alcoholic, doesn't matter if she doesn't think it's an issue. She is well aware of the situation and is trying to emotionally blackmail you. Make sure your child is safe, make sure to tell daycare employees that grandma is not allowed to pick your child up under any circumstances. Go low-contact if you don't want to cut her off completely and do not leave your child alone with her.", "NTA - keep the drunk away from the kids should be a basic rule", "You have more of a problem than not letting your mom FaceTime your kid. You have a mom who's an alcoholic who replaced one addiction (drugs) with another (drinking). And doesn't see that she has a problem. You also knowingly let her drink/be drunk around your kid and watch them while you were away. What if something would have happened? Your kid got hurt? Who would take her to the hospital? Or if something happened to your mom, who would take care of your kid? You put your kid in danger. Time to cut off grandma til she gets her shit together.", "NTA. But you have a choice, adult who has children. Make it.", "NTA. In fact, because she doesn't understand what she did wrong means she has absolutely no gauge for appropriate behavior, which also means that drinking is just one thing. What's next, is the next question. If she can't gauge that drinking and driving is just as bad as drinking and caring for a toddler who needs your constant attention, then what else is she not going to consider a big deal that really is a big deal? Good for you for putting your children first and for seeking therapy.  Her feelings being hurt is not your problem. Her loss of a relationship with your children is not your problem. Finally, if she should've known you would do this to her, then she should've known not to drink so you didn't have to do it.", "NTA - your child is your first priority and safety, and you set boundaries that are REALLY MINIMAL..
