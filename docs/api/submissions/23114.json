Now, I'm happily married with a toddler daughter and another on the way. \n\nMy mom has chilled out a lot thanks to finding the right medication. Although she still likes her drink. I told her about the way her behavior has deeply hurt me, and she was remorseful and apologetic. \n\nLast year, I asked her to be my nanny. I paid her $2,500/mo to watch my kid 4-5 days/ week while I WFH and sometimes she would stay on the weekends so we could go out. \n\nHer drinking makes me uncomfortable and triggers my anxiety big time. When she would stay over, she would often get a 12-pack delivered and drink the whole thing.\n\nI've told her a few times I don't want to be around her drinking and I don't want her to drink while she is responsible for my kid. She said she understands, but the problem persisted. Since this behavior peaks my anxiety, I would often get snippy and short with her. \n\nIt all came to a head\n\n. My husband and I were going to see 3 nights of our favorite band in another state where my aunt lives. Originally, we were going to leave mom and kid at home. We brought them both so they could spend time with my aunt. We set a clear expectation that my mom would only drink the first night before the concerts and that she would wake up every morning by 9 to take over toddler duties.\n\nWhat happened was that she drank a 12-pack every night, never woke up before 11and never took over toddler duties. In the evenings while we were gone, my aunt watched my kid. \n\nOn night 3 of the concerts, I got a fever and couldn't go. My aunt had other plans and left. I came upstairs to find my mom drinking again and playing with my daughter. When confronted, she told me that she doesn't think her drinking is a big deal and that I'm an adult now, and I need to get over it. That just bc she couldn't drive a car doesn't mean she can't watch a toddler. Basically implying that my feelings are not valid and that I'm too hard on her.\n\nThat was 4 weeks ago. Since then, I'm back in therapy bc of the way this is tormenting me. My kid is in daycare. \n\nMy mom has sent a few texts indicating she does not think she has done any wrong. I feel like I can't be around someone who doesn't respect my boundaries. She asked if she could facetime my kid and I told her we need space. She told me that I'm being cruel for keeping my toddler from her saying \"I should have known you would do this to me.\"\n\nI don't know that I want to cut off contact with her forever, but I do know that I'm not ready to talk to her and I don't want her as my childcare anymore.

For your toddler: if she asked, tell her that grandma has to sort things out and it will take longer. For your mother: she is denying what she did to you and what effect it could have on your kids. She has to because otherwise she has to admit her wrong found and her addiction to alcohol. Tell her she should go to the anonymous alcoholic and try to find out there what she is doing wrong.
