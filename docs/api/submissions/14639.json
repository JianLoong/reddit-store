Quite frankly it seems like your parents don\u2019t consider your sports important. I suggest you have a frank conversation with them about how unfair it. If they don\u2019t listen is there anyone else you can reach out to such as close family that will be willing to listen to you?", "I would say NTA.\n\nThe chore split doesn't sound fair.  \n\nYou could suggest whatever the new chores are that the two of you alternate doing them weekly, you do one set, he does the other, the next week you switch, that way it might possibly even out.", "NTA. You're standing up for yourself. Just be prepared to handle the fallout cuz unfortunately you have to live with them. Personally I commend you.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are obviously playing favorites and are probably sexist", "NTA\nI don\u2019t think you can change them. But remember this. Parents always expect more labor from their daughters. Don\u2019t give it to them. \n\nFocus on your education, talk to your school counselor about scholarships if you want to go to uni, or about trades and certifications if that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in. \n\nWhen you get out don\u2019t let how they treated you fade. Remember, and when they start asking you to come and care for them remind them you\u2019ve already done your share of unpaid, unappreciated domestic labor. Brother gets to take care of them when they\u2019re old. You get to have the freedom and equity they\u2019ve denied you.", "NTA\n\nThe burden they're putting on you is beyond unfair, and it may or may not be classic sexism. (It probably is.) And in addition to the resentment they're planting in you, they're doing Alex a huge disservice. He's being trained to be an incompetent young adult.\n\nChores aren't supposed to be just free labor from your kids. They should also be good training for becoming independent. Everybody should be leaving the nest with some well-rounded basic life skills. The only silver lining is that you'll be set in that respect.", "That\u2019s not fair of your parents at all. Being busy is not an excuse to not to do chores. If your brother is too busy to pull his weight on household tasks, then he should drop a sport activity or two.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou expressed your disdain for the inequality in the chores realm. It's really not that difficult to give him an extra one or two. Being busy isn't an excuse.", "NTA. Your parents are giving you more housework based on your gender. You should continue the strike until volleyball and ballet are given equal weight and your brother starts washing dishes.", " NTA\n\n\nBut you will probably lose this. They can take away your Sport and socially isolate you. Calculate the cost and be prepared to always be less important. Watch your grades and maybe even find a job.", "NTA!!! That is so sexist! Direct action gets the goods!!! Keep it going, idk you but im proud of you for standing up for yourself! Don\u2019t budge to the sexist gender roles your parents expect of you. This is, in my opinion, 100% to due with the fact that your genders differ. Ngl I received this treatment growing up, as  male, and looking back it was so unfair for my sister! Don\u2019t give up!", "NTA\n\nBut, I think you're fighting a losing battle.  Your parents are almost certainly deluding themselves that they are preparing you for adulthood with these chores and, to a certain extent, parentalizing you.  And, in a way they are.  You need to learn how to deal with blatantly unfair situations.  Your folks sound like sexists to me, who feel that making your brother do real housework is emasculating.  They're unlikely to bend.  And your brother is unlikely to stop enjoying letting you carry the burden of unfun tasks.  But, when you leave the nest there will be no shortage of individuals who want to bully and take advantage of you.  Might as well learn now.\n\nMeanwhile, maybe look at colleges so far away that you won't be required to come home much.", "NTA sounds like you're doing more chores than your parents too, you're right to feel annoyed.", "NTA! Sounds like your parents are dumping the majority of the chores on you because you are a female. The division of chores is in no way fair. Let them know you will not put up with it anymore!\n\nIf Alex doesn't like it, offer to trade chores for 6 months.", "NTA are your parents doing any chores?  Because it seems like you kids are doing everything.  \n\nIt does sound uneven, and maybe you can propose the occasional switch.  Alex does your chores for a week, you do his - you can propose it under the guise of \"everyone should learn how to do all of these things\".", "NTA.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you put together what you think is a fair schedule and share it with your parents.   \n\nIt\u2019s often easier to get an outcome if you give someone a solution they just have to agree to rather than making them come up with something themselves\n\nThink hard about what is fair.  If you suggest something that is obviously biased in your favour, it will backfire.  Also take into account that mowing the lawn is a big chore in itself (assuming it\u2019s a decent sized garden).  Mowing the lawn typically takes more than a few minutes.", "NTA. There should be a more equitable division of labor or a rotation of chores so that everyone is contributing. Everyone should be responsible for their own laundry.", "NTA. You're expected to keep up a house because... he wants to play basketball? Your parents seem to have a lot of thoughts on what girls should be doing in life.", "NTA. It sounds like your parents give you the majority of the chores because they don\u2019t want to hear Alex complain or because they have outdated and sexist opinions. I would suggest sitting down with them and explaining how the imbalance of chores punishes you and makes it difficult for you to pursue other interests. How they respond might make your future choices a lot clearer.", "NTA. You are only asking for equality. Don't back down. No more chores until they are equal. You can always each have seperate chores, but then switch over each week or month.", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents are being sexist AHs. Good for you for taking a stand!", "You should recommend rotating chores this way it\u2019s equal", "NTA and if I must say I love that you are standing your ground and speaking up for yourself! I grew up in a home exactly like yours and I never said anything because I was brainwashed and trained like that. Keep on your strike and remember that what you are asking is an equal division of chores and that your hobbies and feelings matter too.", "Do you only do your laundry, or everyone\u2019s ? How big is your yard ? Do you have a push mower or riding mower ? I have a large yard. I cut it once a week, and it takes me 3 hrs, and is physically exhausting. On the other hand, it takes 10 min to do dishes, and 30 min to vacuum and mop. And I don\u2019t vacuum and mop daily. 2-3 times a week is good so long no one is a slob. I would rather do dishes and floors daily than mow my lawn once a week. But, without knowing how big your yard is, it is hard to judge. You should definitely not have to do everyone\u2019s laundry, and I hope you are only responsible for your own. Maybe ask for a fair split. You wash dishes and he dries. You vacuum and he mops. One week he mows the yard and the next week you do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why do you think OP\u2019s brother deserves to have more time to spend however he pleases then OP does?", "Perhaps so (though I suppose it depends on the lawn, and my point was that by arguing that it only takes a couple of minutes, I'm guessing we'd get a different version from him) - this is why I suggested alternating.", "If we take all the chores OP does and added them together then divided them evenly over the week, then we took all chores OP\u2019s brother does in a week and divided them evenly who do you think spend considerably more time doing chores.\n\nHowever we don\u2019t need OP\u2019s word that the chores are unequal.

Either that or, better yet, since she doesn't say but her parents seem to imply that the time commitments by the brother are more extensive, she could start on some extracurriculars that take up the same amount of time as the brother's, and then stand on the position that they have equal amounts of free time and the parents' argument that it's not the same is bunk.  But that would still mean a rebalancing and alternating them seems fairest to me."]}
