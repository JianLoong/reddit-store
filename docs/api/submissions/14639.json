Remember, and when they start asking you to come and care for them remind them you\u2019ve already done your share of unpaid, unappreciated domestic labor.

You get to have the freedom and equity they\u2019ve denied you.", "NTA\n\nThe burden they're putting on you is beyond unfair, and it may or may not be classic sexism. (It probably is.) And in addition to the resentment they're planting in you, they're doing Alex a huge disservice. He's being trained to be an incompetent young adult.\n\nChores aren't supposed to be just free labor from your kids. They should also be good training for becoming independent. Everybody should be leaving the nest with some well-rounded basic life skills. The only silver lining is that you'll be set in that respect.", "That\u2019s not fair of your parents at all.

Don\u2019t give up!", "NTA\n\nBut, I think you're fighting a losing battle.  Your parents are almost certainly deluding themselves that they are preparing you for adulthood with these chores and, to a certain extent, parentalizing you.  And, in a way they are.  You need to learn how to deal with blatantly unfair situations.  Your folks sound like sexists to me, who feel that making your brother do real housework is emasculating.  They're unlikely to bend.  And your brother is unlikely to stop enjoying letting you carry the burden of unfun tasks.  But, when you leave the nest there will be no shortage of individuals who want to bully and take advantage of you.

Everyone should be responsible for their own laundry.", "NTA. You're expected to keep up a house because... he wants to play basketball? Your parents seem to have a lot of thoughts on what girls should be doing in life.", "NTA. It sounds like your parents give you the majority of the chores because they don\u2019t want to hear Alex complain or because they have outdated and sexist opinions.

I would rather do dishes and floors daily than mow my lawn once a week. But, without knowing how big your yard is, it is hard to judge. You should definitely not have to do everyone\u2019s laundry, and I hope you are only responsible for your own. Maybe ask for a fair split. You wash dishes and he dries. You vacuum and he mops.

The problem with that system is that you shovel when it snows and it does not snow every day. You take the bins to the curb once a week on trash day. People eat multiple times per day. They wear clothes every day. People have different vacuuming and sweeping preferences but at my house growing up we vacuumed every day. Our workloads were not at all equal because all of his chores were occasional. \n\nAll that aside, Alex\u2019s inside chores sound like what I would ask a little kid to do.

I also just so happened to be the one with the least extra curriculars and worst grades. Whenever I was asked to do extra work I asked why my sisters couldn't help, and it was always they are doing homework or studying and 'you don't study as much so you can't have that excuse'. Didn't matter how important my test was, I wasn't the same type of academic so it wasn't the same, or my social life wasn't the same as my brother's so I couldn't go out.

Suggest having a thing in place where no one talks over the other, like the \"talking pillow\". That way, they'll have to listen.

Which means they intentionally gave her brother more leisure time. \n\nFor the sake of discussion let\u2019s say it takes her brother an hour to mow the lawn every week, and it takes OP 30 minutes everyday of the week to do dishes.
