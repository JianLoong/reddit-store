Anyway, 10 people are listed as interviewed in the report, which made no sense, there were 6 people at the hospital with us when he was brought in by EMT & we were all interview. So we got with our lawyer and sat down to read it. The other 4 people in the police report turned out to be someone my mom claimed to be a very good friend, she came to our sons baby shower, she came to our sons funeral, she made food for us, she was in our inner circle. We get to the last 3 pages of the 18 page report, to read this woman & 3 of her neighbors-none of which know me or ever met my son, including \u201cmy moms friend\u201d. These women called law enforcement and blatantly stated we know she killed her son. She (me) had a conversation with one of them supposedly in front of my husband when my son was again supposedly 2 months old about how weird would it be if he died of SIDS & it would be so weird anyway, the first two lines of her report is \u201cwhen I found out blanks son died, I immediately called investigators to let them know she murdered her son and about this conversation we \u201chad\u201d. I\u2019ve never met this women, I\u2019ve never even talked to her so idk why she would say any of that but again, not my problem because we were cleared. Here comes the asshole part, only 3 of us have this report, me & two other people with copies so I can assume who the two are because out of the 6 people there it was my mother, my father, me & my husband that have our one copy so it leaves only 2 out of 6 left to decide who has it. Anyway, one of them took the 18 page report, redacted all of our information, everyone\u2019s information except these 4 random women, and posted it to an internet sleuth group with over 2 million members, anonymously. The report had these women\u2019s information down to last 4 of social, cell numbers, addresses, names, everything to identify them. We got a text this morning, my mother did, from her \u201cfriend\u201d begging my mom to ask me to take down the post that these 4 women have been harassed by thousands via text, email, social media, three of them are real estate agents and claim over 20,000 complaints have been made against them since this post has been posted. I didn\u2019t post it, so I can\u2019t remove it. Are me and my husband assholes if we don\u2019t ask them to take it down because personally I believe they deserve the absolute shame they are getting but again no one should feel safe at home.

Yes. They don't deserve such kindness from you, but if you chose to do this, you would get to maintain the moral high ground.
