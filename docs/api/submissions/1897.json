What exactly was \u201cgoing on\u201d? Did you ask your manager to send kid away?\n\nETA - ESH the bully because he was a jerk in school & your manager for putting another target on your back & refusing service for something that had nothing to do with the business.

There are very few businesses who will kick out a money source because of this reason. \n\nI know dealing with you past bullies is bloody hard, but if you ever want to get past that trauma, you have to face it.", "Info: How long ago was this bullying? Like was it recently or already 5+ years ago? And did he make any attempt to bully you again or did you go straight to your superior?\n\nAs I see it you could have asked to be switched with another waiter or maybe ask your superior to take over this one person. Honestly unless he did anything at your work you should have sucked it up and do your job. He can go anywhere he likes and I think you had no right to have him sent away when he didn't do anything at the restaurant. Is he an AH for bullying you and make you miss school? Sure. But you should still do your job as long as he behaves. The title also makes it sound like you specifically asked your superior to send him away and not like it was his decision. So I'm going soft YTA.", "Yta....you could have switched with another waiter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can't be expected to deal with that at work.", "INFO did you ask for him to be removed or just explain the bullying?", "Came here to say this.  Mishandled by manager but OP is NTA.", "That\u2019s a bold statement without the context of the type of bullying involved. Over 50 days of missed school because of this bully, over quarter of the school year. Thats a huge amount of missed school time - and bullying can get down right criminal in some places. \n\nPersonally I think the manager did the right thing - they had their staffs back. They didn\u2019t try to force their employee to work in a setting that would be distressing. People have moved states and countries in an effort to avoid ever seeing their bullies again, and bullies don\u2019t disappear or stop after high school. \u201cGrowing up\u201d and \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d is called rug sweeping and is conditioned behavior to say give that person permission to treat you like shit without consequences because it save drama for other people.", "INFO on that, I guess. Did the OP actually request that the bully be kicked out or did the boss (who knows OP and presumably really likes them) hear what they said and go, \"fuck this kid, I don't need his money.\" \n\nBecause those are very different things. \n\nSome adults end up feeling paternal/maternal when it comes to very young employees, so I can imagine a workplace closing ranks against someone like this, similar to kicking out a stalker/abusive ex even if said person doesn't know their former target is around yet.", "I just explained the bullying", "As someone who has gone through therapy for abuse, yes its a bold statement. \n\nWorking through trauma is needed and healthy. And it takes work. Sometimes for your own mental health it is healthy to face your fears.\n\nYes the manager did a good thing, but there are very few places that will react that way. Many will not lose their company revenue to protect their workers, sad as that fact is.", "My boss has always made it clear to the entire staff base repeatedly that no client can bring enough money that they are willing to risk loosing an employee over or ask their employees to work in a situation that makes them remotely uncomfortable. I\u2019ve seen her get into a shouting match with one client after making one of her staff cry - honestly it was the most beautiful thing ever to watch a boss have their staffs back with such conviction. There\u2019s a reason most of the staff have been there since she took over the business.", "I think that's probably what happened. The manager could've moved the bully to a different section.", "NTA. Your manager handled this poorly - B should've just had their order taken by someone else if no other incident occurred in the food hall. \nAs someone else said, at worst if this person hasn't changed, there's a target on the whole foodhall now but ESPECIALLY you. \nIt absolutely sucks that you had to deal with B showing up there, but it sounds like you left it for your manager to handle and they chose to be confrontational. Speaking as someone who was bullied (though not nearly to the same degree, I'm so sorry for you), that just doesn't work and breeds more resentment and anger towards the victim.", "I do agree that getting help dealing with the trauma of being bullied is important, for all we know though OP may be in therapy and still in the process of getting things sorted out. They were pretty vague about what their intention was in going to manager - did they want manager to ask them to leave or were they hoping manager would move them to a different area? \n\nUltimately though once the manager was informed of the past, what happened next was completely out of OPs control or hands. The Manager made the decision to ask them to leave. Even if OP explicitly asked for them to be removed, manager had the final say in either direction. Yes it is rare that a company will protect its employees over profits, but isn\u2019t that all the more reason to respect OPs manager for putting the well-being of their staff ahead?"]}
