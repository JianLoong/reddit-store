She told me I was old enough to treat them all exactly the same and to imagine how it would feel for her kids to think I don't love them the same. She complained to my dad when he got home and he asked me about it. I told him her kids don't mean the same to me as my siblings so I got them something to be nice vs actually wanting to and trying to be their big brother.

It's been more than a week and my dad asked if I would consider spending more on Joy's kids to keep the peace. I told him I wasn't willing to do that.

Its not about the dollar amount of the gifts, its about you DGAF about the kids and have no problem showing it to everyone. Dad is still early in this relationship, what if they stay married for the rest of their lives? Is she just going to be some lady and they just some people forever? If they stay together and you show you just don\u2019t give a shit about them its not going to give a pathway to having an inclusive relationship later.

It\u2019s a shame that a 16 yr old young adult is letting his dad enable him with fixing  his problems by buying more gifts and putting your name on the label. He\u2019s trying to keep the peace, and in the process enabling you, while alienating and driving a wedge with his wife, and save his step children from hurt feelings. That\u2019s very unfair to put him in that position. But he\u2019s the only one acting like an adult here. \n\nYes, You are entitled to spend your own money the way you choose to on gifts. \nYou\u2019re also free to decide who gets gifts and who doesn\u2019t. You do not have to give any explanation for your decisions. You are correct that it is not Joy\u2019s business how you spend your money. So for technicality sake, here you are NTA. \n\nJoy was inappropriately fishing for information like If you bought her a gift or not, how much did you spend on her, if you bought for your friends or not, etc. She\u2019s looking for information that she can use against you to make her case stronger. You were right not to tell her that information in the midst of a dispute. Really, you don\u2019t ever have to tell her. But definitely not while there\u2019s conflict. \n\nAs for not buying your step siblings more gifts, you\u2019re perfectly justified not to spend more of your own money on them. It was nice of you to even buy them anything at all. You certainly aren\u2019t obligated. And that is where Joy is inappropriate in acting entitled to more gifts on her children\u2019s behalf. You do not have to buy anyone anything and you are free to pick and choose. I mean, you could have chosen to buy for your sister and not your brother for that matter and no one could have any right to be angry about it because it\u2019s your money and your choice. \n\nWith that said, this comes down to a matter of family dynamics which can be complicated; and emotions which are rarely rational. \n\nI understand where Joy is coming from because your step-siblings are going to notice the difference in gifts. If not by the cost, but by quantity then. They\u2019re quite young and if they\u2019re told the truth as to why they\u2019re not being treated the same way, they will be hurt and probably will have a hard time understanding why their older brother \u201cdoesn\u2019t love them\u201d. They\u2019re not going to get it. Hell, if you did that to them when they were adults they would still have hurt feelings because you don\u2019t want to accept them as your family, which you said yourself. \n\nBut what really is hurtful most of all in all of this, is how you are using cruel and hurtful statements, even if they are true for you, against Joy and her children. This is why you are an AH. \n\nYou don\u2019t consider Joy your parent. \n\nYou don\u2019t see them as your siblings. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to try to be their big brother. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to buy more gifts.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to try to keep the peace (in other words no room for compromise or giving in).\n\nI can\u2019t help wondering how Joy feels about you rejecting her in the stepmother/mother figure she is trying to play. How she feels about you in general, if she cares about you and you\u2019re rejecting her. It\u2019s not just about your step siblings or the gifts. It\u2019s about her trying to make an equal family and treat everyone fairly. How would you feel if she favored her kids over you instead of with equality that she\u2019s expecting? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of hurtful things being said  and done here by you about and to your step family here. You said you\u2019re not a jerk, but it seems like you are acting rather jerk-like here. \n\nJust because you have the right to not buy them gifts, or not as much, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not hurtful and unnecessary drama. Christmas is the holiday of peace, love, kindness. giving and generosity. Would it really hurt to give these little kids a little more?", "YTA.\n\nYou still have to treat the step-siblings to the same level of gifts as your siblings.", "So yeah, a bit of an AH, but only because you asked.   The first reply to anyone to mention in this is \"it's none of your business, you get what you want, I'll get what I want\".\n\nAnd sorry, but the spiteful \"you're not my mom\" is always the jerk move.\n\nNow, what you COULD have done to just keep the peace, especially considering the age difference, is to give the older kids one of the things on Christmas, and if you want to give more, give it to them the night before and just say that you don't want this literal mess to start up.  It's not like they're little and believe in Santa, so they aren't going to care. So on Xmas day, everyone has one thing.  In fact, for the little kids, you can probably get them more as it's likely their stuff is cheaper anyhow.\n\nWhat it really comes down to is forget everyone else, the only thing that really matters is make christmas special for the little kids.

She is a woman your father married and with luck, over time, you will feel like she is but that's not guaranteed. You bought your step siblings a gift which is nice and should not be expected. If she puts a monetary and quantity value on gifts then she has clearly forgot what Christmas is even about and are raising her kids to be entitled assholes. You thinking of them at all (especially at 16 years of age) is MORE than enough and she should be happy you even did that quite frankly. Stand your ground on this one. Remind her that you buying anything at all was in the Christmas spirit and her comparing it shows how little she understands family and a holiday which is about GIVING and not how much you receive.

You are owed an apology, but sadly I\u2019m not holding my breath!\n\n\nYour dad also shouldn\u2019t be buying them more presents just to appease her - I bet he\u2019s already spent the same on them as you guys because their dad isn\u2019t in the picture.

The main issue too (which probably should have been your answer, but hindsight is 20/20 and all)  is that the step siblings are 5 and 7. Spending a lot on gifts at that age is unnecessary. At that age, they'll probably play with a toy for a little bit and forget about it pretty quickly. I have a half sibling that's 15 years younger. We aren't particularly close because of the age gap and I didn't grow up in the same house (he was a baby for the couple years I lived with my Dad). I didn't spend much on his gifts when he was little because they lose interest.

Basically an aunt (hopefully cool and fun aunt ;)) that supports them (help with homework, make sure they have supplies they need, advocate for them in school as needed, based on my experience and knowledge), makes sure they are safe. And whatever beyond that develops or does not, based on the kiddos. \n\nA 16 yr old has known you 2 yr, and you think you can pull the \"because I am the mommy\" card?  GTFOH.", "Wow...I wish you could write me a letter filled with all of this wisdom so I could present it to my stepfather.\n\nThank you for framing what I knew internally to be true.", "Gabor Mate's explanation of the term step parent was great, it means for someone to step into the role of parenting. He had a lot of fascinating things to say but the best part was that just because a parent chose a partner doesn't mean the child has to choose that partner. He said it was crucial for person stepping into the role build trust with the child so the child wants a relationship with you. It was insanely validating for me. His knowledge on trauma from being forced to tolerate people you did not choose is pretty great too if anyone is interested.", "Unless you are twice widowed. \nBut then again... that would be (digits out of my bum) 0.7 % of the third marriages.", "The surrogate story could be a lie from the father that OP believes is true, but a lot of insurance does cover surrogacy.", "If you are dating a single parent you have to realize when it comes to the child you should be taking on the role the child wants from you, which might not necessarily be what you and your partner were thinking. I have a long term partner (not married or ever intending to be) and me and his daughter are nothing more than polite because I let her set the tone. She needs something from the store? That\u2019s cool I\u2019ll grab it. Christmas gift? Yeah I\u2019ll help her dad shop because I pay better attention to what she is into. I don\u2019t understand why step parents don\u2019t understand roles and boundaries.", "That\u2019s such a good analogy. \n\nI just think there is no need, especially where there is shared custody- you can see a partner totally separately to your child being impacted. For single parents without shared custody or another involved parent, it\u2019s much harder.\n\nThe rates of abuse of step parents to step children is also innumerably higher.", "You need to have a longer talk with your dad. Maybe a day trip or whatnot after the holidays. Something you can do to get away from everyone else and have a chat. \n\nBasically you're going to have to make him understand that stepmom trying to metaphorically beat you into a perfectly happy family is backfiring horribly."]}
