I got my sister this makeup case she's been wanting, some decals for her Switch and I got her some packs of Animal Crossing amiibo cards. I got my brother three video games he's wanted for a while and I got him a second controller for his PS5. I work PT and I save most of my money so I could afford to do this. I got a toy for each of my stepsiblings, not even really sure what they were, but not very expensive. I was wrapping them while everyone else was out. Joy came home early and saw me wrapping them, asked where the rest of the gifts were, I said that was it, and she got mad at me because she realized her kids got way less compared to my siblings and the effort was put into my siblings more. She told me I was old enough to treat them all exactly the same and to imagine how it would feel for her kids to think I don't love them the same. She complained to my dad when he got home and he asked me about it. I told him her kids don't mean the same to me as my siblings so I got them something to be nice vs actually wanting to and trying to be their big brother. Dad spoke to Joy after me and she was annoyed that I didn't see them all as equally my siblings. She questioned me on who else I bought gifts for and I told her it was none of her business. She told me I live in her house, she's the mom of the house, etc. I told her I don't have a mom and that she's not MY mom and I don't owe her the information about who I spend my money on gifts for.\n\nThings are now so tense. It's been more than a week and my dad asked if I would consider spending more on Joy's kids to keep the peace. I told him I wasn't willing to do that. So dad bought some extra gifts for me to say are from me. Joy was pissed and said I was a little asshole because I should not be getting blood family better gifts for being blood when we're all equally one family.\n\nAITA?\n\nAnd for people who will ask or suggest going to my mom's.

Siblings than step siblings, they entered your life at a much later stage. I'd say your a soft Y T A since its clear you seem unwilling to try and bond with your younger siblings and you seem to have refused to try bonding with your dad's wife, someone who probably wants to be/could be a mother figure for you and there is nothing wrong with accepting that just because as a young child you had no mother. Wife is the A H since she seems to have little regard for you (referring to you as a AH, expecting you to buy equally for everyone etc.)\nYour dad is clearly stuck in the middle, as his daughter he wants to support you and your decisions but you have to respect and understand that he has a wife and 4 other kids he loves just as much as you. It's possible to love multiple people equally without taking from one for the other. \nWhat isn't clear is why are you unwilling to accept that you now potentially have a mother and two other siblings? I don't know if you have or not but honestly it sounds if some form of family counciling would be far more beneficial to you and yours than asking random strangers on the Internet.", "I guess everyone here is 16 just like OP. The responses are so dense and immature. I have been in a similar situation on several angles with step siblings, step cousins, step cousins from a newly found biological family, and the scenarios go on and on. Anyway. Its not that the OP should be forced to spend money, its that he straight up has decided these children suck and we aren\u2019t even going to try at blending or showing a little more respect. The gift was nice, but giving people obviously better and not as nice gifts right in front of everyone sets a bad tone. Do it privately so as to not rock the boat. Its not about the dollar amount of the gifts, its about you DGAF about the kids and have no problem showing it to everyone. Dad is still early in this relationship, what if they stay married for the rest of their lives? Is she just going to be some lady and they just some people forever? If they stay together and you show you just don\u2019t give a shit about them its not going to give a pathway to having an inclusive relationship later. This is coming from someone with lots of step family members and remarried into the family members. If you show a little effort in ways in a relationship it will go a long way down the road.", "Everyone here sucks somewhat IMHO!\n\nYou got some thing for them which you do not know what is? That is kinda an AH move\n\nThis is for me not about money, it is not about the number of presents...\n\nFor me giving a gift is thinking about the person receiving it... What do they like, does she like cars?, does he like construction things?... And then picking out a thing that just makes sense. \nSomething thoughtful of how it will be perceived and if it will spread a bit of happiness.\n\nYour step mom while she should not meddle in your choises, I do understand her reaction a little tiny bit to...
