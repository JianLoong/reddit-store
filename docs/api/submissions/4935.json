She has two kids who are 7m and 5f. My siblings (14m and 13f) and I 16m live with our dad and Joy. I don't consider Joy my parent or her kids my siblings but I'm not a jerk either so when I went Christmas shopping I did get them gifts, but nothing like what I got my siblings. I got my sister this makeup case she's been wanting, some decals for her Switch and I got her some packs of Animal Crossing amiibo cards. I got my brother three video games he's wanted for a while and I got him a second controller for his PS5. I work PT and I save most of my money so I could afford to do this. I got a toy for each of my stepsiblings, not even really sure what they were, but not very expensive. I was wrapping them while everyone else was out. Joy came home early and saw me wrapping them, asked where the rest of the gifts were, I said that was it, and she got mad at me because she realized her kids got way less compared to my siblings and the effort was put into my siblings more. She told me I was old enough to treat them all exactly the same and to imagine how it would feel for her kids to think I don't love them the same. She complained to my dad when he got home and he asked me about it. I told him her kids don't mean the same to me as my siblings so I got them something to be nice vs actually wanting to and trying to be their big brother. Dad spoke to Joy after me and she was annoyed that I didn't see them all as equally my siblings. She questioned me on who else I bought gifts for and I told her it was none of her business. She told me I live in her house, she's the mom of the house, etc. I told her I don't have a mom and that she's not MY mom and I don't owe her the information about who I spend my money on gifts for.\n\nThings are now so tense. It's been more than a week and my dad asked if I would consider spending more on Joy's kids to keep the peace. I told him I wasn't willing to do that. So dad bought some extra gifts for me to say are from me. Joy was pissed and said I was a little asshole because I should not be getting blood family better gifts for being blood when we're all equally one family.\n\nAITA?\n\nAnd for people who will ask or suggest going to my mom's. I literally don't have one. My siblings and I were born to a surrogate for dad to be our sole parent. He became a single parent to three. The surrogate has no legal rights to us. So no mom.", "created_utc": 1671270833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo30of/aita_for_buying_my_siblings_better_gifts_than_my/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're 16 and you have limited money. A controller and a make up set itself sounds a bit expensive. \n\n2. They were small kids. It's not wise to give little kids expensive gifts since they may end up breaking them.\n\n3. You're right who you buy gifts for is no one's business since it's your money", "NTA. You're 16. A child. You're not obligated to spend anything on anyone at your age. The fact that you've used the money you've saved from your part-time job to get something nice for your siblings and stepsiblings shows that you're a caring older brother. Your step siblings are 7 and 5. They have no concept of the monetary value of anything. They'll just be happy they got something. \n\nYour stepmother needs to back all the way off. And I say this as a stepmother myself. She can not force a sibling bond between you in the same way as she cannot force a parent/child relationship between you. It takes time, and putting this pressure on will drive a wedge in. Your dad needs to step up here and defend you.", "NTA. Their not your siblings and Joy is not your mother. Also, just ignoring blood for a second, her kids are tiny compared to your siblings. With the age difference their very unlikely to even clock you've spent less on them as long as what you've gotten them is something they'll enjoy.

After 16 years, he cannot suddenly force a mother and new siblings onto you.", "NTA.

I buy my sibling better gifts then I do people that I do not consider family. Just because you're the oldest it doesn't mean that you have to treat everyone the same.

They\u2019re not your siblings. Your dad\u2019s marital status doesn\u2019t actually matter. How you feel about them do. Your dad is an asshole for letting Joy treat you like that.", "NTA. 1. Your father has only been with this woman a couple years. How are you possibly going to think of these kids as your siblings? 2. Even if they were all your siblings, it's normal to spend more on teenagers than very little kids. 3. You are 16. Your father and maybe stepmother if she really want to play like mommy, should be giving you money to buy gifts for siblings and step siblings.

Tell your dad to look inside his trouser to see if he still has something called balls. How you feel towards someone is nobodies business and the fact that you bought them something itself is good and that too with your own money when you didn't have to. You don't owe them shit and if you don't consider or feel the lady as your mom, her kids is just roomies for you. If its your money, you get to choose how you spend it and who you spend it on. Keep that lady at a distance as she's one of those entitled ones who think everyone owes them something. You would make a fine man some day and do look after your siblings.", "NTA Asking where the other gifts were was rude and suggests that she is not handling the family situation in a mature way, it sounds like it was about her feelings rather than her children's.

I get it.  They aren't your siblings and shouldn't be forced to spend equal money on anyone BUT you can show a little effort.  They are still kids.  Christmas to them is still very much rooted in magic, gifts,  etc while to the older two, they are grateful you got them things.  Step mom or whatever she is,  has no business in your spending but she's correct that you shouldn't show so openly how little you care about two children you live with.  Because again, they are kids.  They didn't ask for this anymore than you did.  Remember that.", "yta, just because they\u2019re not biological doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not family. As the oldest you are who the others look up to and having this attitude that you don\u2019t care about those you live with will be so damaging for everyone.

My siblings and I grew up not feeling the loss of a second parent or a mother if we're being more specific. Even my sister admits it didn't bother her. So I think she thought the three of us would be super excited about her and her kids and it would be super easy to make us all one big family because she could offer us something we never had.", "They don't have their bio father in their life so no extra gifts from him or his side.", "OP did show effort though? They bought their step siblings gifts, they just bought their siblings better gifts. \n\nOP is 16, it\u2019s sweet they\u2019re buying their siblings such good gifts and if they don\u2019t see the step siblings are siblings then of course they\u2019re not going to get them the same kind of gifts they get their siblings. That doesn\u2019t make them TA.", "You cannot make a family by force. The father got married, which added two siblings in the house.

You can\u2019t force someone to feel a family connection to people, if OP doesn\u2019t feel the same way towards their step siblings as they do to their siblings it\u2019s not a bad thing and it doesn\u2019t make them TA.\n\nPlus they bought the steps gifts even though they\u2019re not close, that\u2019s more than enough", "Everyone sees the world different you don't get to tell people who they consider family especially non blood children you literally met 2 years ago. OP doesn't have to be jealous to have a bigger bond with the siblings OP literally grew up with.", "Child support though.\n\n\nAt any rate, it's none of your business, you gift whatever you want.", "Getting the same kind of gifts and buying gifts that they obviously stated they put little to no thought into, isn't the same thing.  At 16, you need to learn to treat people the same especially if they are innocent in an impossible and complicated situation. This is going to children, not the step mom.  Just grabbing something off a self isn't effort and if they start this now,  it will set off a chain reaction that was completely unnecessary. \n\nIt isn't always about the gift itself.  It's just the fact that they can set aside feelings and show some kind of feeling towards, again, two kids who also didn't ask to be in this situation", "Actually, at 16 you know that you don\u2019t have to treat everyone the same. You can treat people you care about better than people you don\u2019t care about. \n\nIf the stepmom is worried about the amount of gifts or quality of gifts her kids receive that\u2019s on her to remedy, not her 16 year old step kid. \n\nWhy should they set aside their feelings and spend their hard earned money on two kids they don\u2019t have a sibling relationship with? OP is only 16, they also didn\u2019t ask to be in this situation."]}
