I live in an appartment with a little garden shared with the rest of my neighbors in my building, but my cat doesn't go outside for many reasons (lots of traffic on the street, other cats fighting in the garden, etc.) I still live with my mom.\n\nMy mom's friend owns a cat who goes outside, because she lives in an area without much traffic and have a big house with a garden. when she learned that we adopted a cat, she started telling us some \"advices\" to take care of the cat, which weren't really advices but basically orders for us to do. Like she said my cat NEEDS to go outside. I said no, I've already talked to the vet about this and he said it's better to keep him inside. She keeps insisting that we should let him go outside because according to her, if he stays inside he'll became fat, sick, with unrinary problems, etc. The thing is her cat is fat AND has urinary problems so her arguments aren't really worth anything.\n\nThe other night, my mom's friend came to eat dinner with my mom. All the evening she yelled at my cat, and even splashed water at him, telling us she's going to educate him, etc. I didn't say anything because I didn't wanted to ruin the evening. But the thing that made me snap is when she opened the door of our balcony, and said to my cat to go outside. Thankfully he didn't go outside, and I took him in my bedroom after that. I went back to her, closed the balcony and said to her \"It's MY cat, you do not have anything to say about how we take care of him because you're not a vet!\" then she started yelling that I can't talk to her like that since I'm only 19 and she said she knows what's better for my cat because his brother is a vet. I then told her \"Your brother being a vet doesn't makes you a vet. You don't know what's better for my cat because I am his owner and I and only I have the right to take decisions about him. If you don't like it then you can piss off.\" Then she told me I'm not well educated and then I told her that she's insulting my parents by saying that. I said that she was rude and that she needed to shut up and leave AND to stay away from my cat, and then I went back to my room.\n\nMy mom didn't say anything because she's going through a lot and didn't wanted to get involved in a fight. I talked to her the next day about it and she said that she agrees with me, but that I need to apologies to her friend. I said no because she didn't apologies either so why would I?  \nI talked about this with 2 friends, one who has cats, and they all agreed with me.

Not only is there a large increase in population, but also cat's can die outside from a multitude of things and let's not forget all it takes is one cat who's positive for FIV to bite another cat's and that's a death sentence. Youre doing right by your cats and should be proud of yourself for standing your ground. Also, I agree with you, not apologizing. People will only treat you how you allow them too and if you apologize, it shows they can continue to be disrespectful towards you with no recourse.", "NTA.

Cause cats are predators its not their fault, but they kill literally BILLIONS of native birds and other animals. Your cat doesn't need to hunt for food cause you are providing it for them. Outdoor cats are horrible for wildlife. I love cats I really do, but I think they should be kept indoors.

I know people give commands disguised as unsolicited advice for human kids, but I'd never heard of anyone doing this with fur babies. You learn something new everyday.  Hopefully you learn that when that insufferable person comes over you take your cat & go to your room.

If you've already found out what it best for your specific cat, no one can tell you otherwise.", "NTA.  Cats don\u2019t need to go outside. I used to work at a vet clinic and it was so heart breaking to have cats that we couldn\u2019t find owners for in our deep freeze.  Sometimes they\u2019d be declawed. We would take a paw print in clay and put a date on it with a description.  Both of my cats are  indoor only. Neither are fat and they have good lives. They don\u2019t need to worry about coyotes, bobcats, raccoons, bears or other wildlife.  They don\u2019t catch diseases or get worms.

If anyone says you are, then, what if that was your human child? Would they feel the same? Inside cats live way longer than outside cats for so many reasons.

For most it\u2019s eye infections, but some have respiratory infections, and one or two have tested positive for FIV.  One kitten that my friend rescued and took to the vet for medical care had to be put down a day or two later because the infection she had was so severe it destroyed about 50% of her respiratory function.

During the summer months I will take them out into the garden, if I'm out there, but we have measures in place (cat fencing) to ensure they are unable to stray from the garden. My cats had a vet check just before christmas and they are in perfect health. There is absolutely no reason to let a cat out.

It's not safe for them outdoors, they can get hit by cars/traffic, they can get poisoned either accidently or deliberately, they can get lost, they can get stolen, they can get killed by predators, they can get killed/hurt in fights with other cats or other animals such as dogs, they can pick up parasites.
