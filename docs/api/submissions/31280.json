They love you. I would be quite hurt my husband would not share something so personal because I would \u2018worry\u2019. Trust that she is there for you. You can say, I don\u2019t need you to worry, or even, I need some time to myself. But to purposefully keep information like that from your family, it\u2019s just hurtful. I hope you guys can talk it out.", "YTA. Regardless of whether or not you want to talk about your feelings, you told your wife a giant lie for no reason", "Soft YTA because you lost a sister.\n\nBut how you could not tell your *wife* something as important as \"my sister died\".  You got the news, made travel plans, travelled, went to a funeral, came home, and at no time told your spouse that a member of your immediate family passed away.  Whether you were close to your sister or not, that's a major thing to deal with without sharing any of it with your *spouse.* \n\nWhen you said you were \"going to see your sister\" and chose not to include that it was for her funeral you lied by omission.  And if I were your wife I'd wonder how many other major things you've chosen not to tell me. \n\nI can't imagine being so emotionally constipated that I don't even tell the person I'm supposed to love and trust as much as I would a spouse something like this.", "YTA. This is the \u201cfor better, or for worse\u201d part of marriage. The whole point is that you look out for and take care of each other. A sibling dying is a big thing, and not telling her about it is a huge breach of trust.", "YTA\n\nSomeone who excludes their life partner and looks to this particular subreddit for affirmation is by definition T.A.", "I think she\u2019s upset that you didn\u2019t rely on her for such an important event. She probably does want to support and console you and doesn\u2019t understand how you can be \u201cfine\u201d. Another part of her is probably worried that if you didn\u2019t tell her about this, what other emotionally significant events are you keeping to yourself and probably worried about you. I wouldn\u2019t say that your an asshole but I would recommend trying to let her in a little bit", "Sorry, Dude. YTA. You can\u2019t hide things from your spouse and this was a big deal. \n\nAlways be honest with your wife. My recommended approach would have been to tell her what happened and just been clear about what your needs were at the time. You can\u2019t control how worried she feels, but there would have been nothing wrong with asking her at the time to support you by trying to make her worrying less obvious. Let her know why - for example, perhaps it overwhelms you and stresses you out when she worries excessively.", "YTA\n\nYou lied to your wife. That\u2019s simply not okay, \n\nIt appears you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone about your feelings. Your wife, your brother, are both concerned about you. They are your family. It\u2019s their responsibility to check on you & ask if you\u2019re okay. You can\u2019t just ignore them forever. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to deal with your feelings with your family then find someone else to talk to. Anyone. A stranger.

Just talk to someone. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "YTA.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and I wish I did not have to come down on this side.\n\nFunerals are not so much about the dead as they are the living. Even though your wife didn't have a significant relationship with your sister, she *does* have a significant relationship with you, and you had a significant relationship with your sister (and it seems that she has at least a relationship with your brother who also lost a sister).  Saying \"I'm going to see my sister\" but leaving out that it was for a funeral is still a lie of omission.  Putting it on your grieving brother to tell your wife?\n\nWould it have been that hard to say 'my sister died, I'm going to her funeral; the best way to support me in this is to not worry and try to get me to talk about my feelings about this\"?  The reason she feels betrayed is that you had lied to her.", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss but why on earth would you not tell your wife something like this? It is actually healthy to talk about how you feel once in a while (I'm a man, I've tried both). It might feel unnatural, it might be uncomfortable but at the end of the they they're just feelings and nothing to be afraid of. And imagine what you're wife now must be thinking; if you can't share the fact that your sister has passed what else are you keeping all bottled up? She's probably worried sick and or rightfully pissed.", "INFO \n\nWhy did you get married?  What do you think is a normal marriage?\n\nAre you depressed maybe?", "Sadly, YTA. You lied to your wife about why you were traveling rather than 'deal with her constant worrying'. You don't want to talk about your feelings? Fine. Tell her that. Tell her that her worrying over it stresses you out. Tell her you aren't going to discuss it and ask her to drop it. Don't lie because you don't want to deal with it.", "YTA. A death in the family is not something you hide from your wife. Did no one at the funeral ask why your wife wasn't there with you? I couldn't imagine not including my wife in something like this, even though she also has a lot more focus on \"talk about your feelings\" than I do. She is feeling excluded and lied to, and with good reason.", "YTA, it\u2019s something you just tell your partner. And partners worry about grieving partners. That\u2019s just what it is. You would too, right? Instead you could have told her and tell her what you do need from her. You don\u2019t need her to constantly ask you if you\u2019re okay or check up on you every five minutes. But you might need her to understand why you\u2019re going for a long walk on your own (for example) or you might need a few days and th\u00e9n you\u2019ll talk to her. Woman just simply want to know what\u2019s going on instead of being shut out, its not that hard.", "YTA- are you not a team? Do you not communicate? There were ways to tell her and ask her to give you space rather than cut her out and let someone else tell her the news.", "YTA, and you cannot have a healthy marriage without both partners being capable of talking about their feelings. I think it would be good to get into therapy and try to identify why you are so scared of sharing your feelings.", "You\u2019re meant to be a Partnership. This is individual thinking and she has a right to feel betrayed.", "Why are you even married? YTA.", "YTA. You lied to your wife about something huge. I'm sorry for your loss, but treat your wife with more respect.", "This is a rejection of the wifely comfort she would willingly have offered.  She must feel redundant and side lined. You guarded your feelings by disregarding hers.", "Yta. Why would you keep that secret from your partner?", "Yta- you told her you were seeing your sister? Why not just say it\u2019s the funeral", "YTA- You need therapy dude. This is not normal behavior at all, and neither is never ever talking to anyone about your feelings. Go to a therapist", "Wow \n\nYou lied/mislead and misrepresented that you  visiting your sister  That\u2019s weird \n\nSpouses support each other  you just put a colossal issue in your relationship of will she ever trust you \n\nYes have to\nSay yta here", "YTA I\u2019ll be blunt. If you can\u2019t trust her with important information because it might \u201cupset\u201d her, how can she trust you? Marriage is a partnership.", "YTA", "This is really a betrayal. If you can't tell your own wife that your sister died, what else are you keeping from her? What else don't you want her to worry about? Everything? I would reconsider my relationship with you.

You have work to do", "NTA when my dad died I didn\u2019t tell my best friend for like two weeks, and even then it was only because they asked how he was (he\u2019d had cancer and their dad had died the same way so they knew what I was going through), because that\u2019s just how I dealt with it; I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the absolute healthiest thing for me to do but it was a very personal situation no matter how much my friend could relate. They were initially hurt that I hadn\u2019t told them sooner but they understood that I just hadn\u2019t wanted to think about it and that I had wanted to pretend like things were normal for a little while longer. I\u2019m really sorry for your loss and I\u2019m sorry your wife isn\u2019t speaking to you on top of it; she\u2019ll come around (edit- after a good apology for lying to her \ud83d\ude2c)", "NAH. I don't think anyone can accuse you of being an asshole, everyone deals with grief in their own way, and although ideally you should tell your wife, I feel like you deserve a pass in this situation and she should have more understanding towards you and try to understand why you might have kept it to yourself. That said, I get why she's upset, but yeah, neither of you are assholes imo.", "NTA. It's your grief and you choose how to handle it. You and your wife are still two separate individuals and you both have a right to proceed grief in a way that is comfortable for each of you.

You get to deal with your grief about your sister however you want to. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH. You grieve how you grieve and you don't want to be fussed over, which is fair. I can see your wife's point. Death is a big thing and death of a sibling is huge. She's probably concerned that you don't tell her or won't tell her of any other big things that happen. And is wondering why, which is where the trust thing comes in - \"he doesn't trust me to help/he doesn't trust me with this information\" etc. Communicate when you're both ready and my condolences for your sister's passing.", "Soft ESH for you because you lied about a very big thing, but your wife is overreacting to your intention to grieve how it\u2019s best for you, so she\u2019s definitely in the wrong here. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. Please consider bereavement couples counseling if your wife continues to make this all about her. You needed to withdraw, and didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d give you the space that you need; currently, she\u2019s proving that thought correct.

You don't want to talk about your feelings, okay, whatever, you're emotionally constipated. Fine. But you lied to your wife about something of great importance, and you did it for no good reason whatsoever. Have you considered that she worries about you because she cares about you and you don't let her know whether or not you're okay, or give her any emotional feedback at all? Why are you married?", "YTA. This is not normal and you deliberately lie to her saying that \"you were going to see your sister\" when you went to the funeral. It is normal for your wife to be mad at you and not understand why you are behaving this way. Dude, I am sorry for your loss, but either you are in shock or something like that or you have serious problems to not tell the person you share your life with something as important for you and your family like that. Bollocks, you probably tell your wife all kind of minor things like what you had for lunch or what you watched on the telly, but you deliberately didn't tell her about your sister's death, lied to her about going to her funeral and robbed her the chance to support you and your family (her in-laws, after all) in a bad time. Do you really think this is normal?", "YTA\n\nYou purposely hid something that is a BIG deal. Grief is weird. A lot of people live in denial for a while because it's unbearable. I don't blame you for that, but there are some people you always tell that someone has died. Your wife is top of that list.\n\nAll you've done is tell your wife that she isn't worth your time. The way you describe her 'constant worrying' isn't as something you can't handle but as something irritating, like she's nagging you. Your wife loves you and wants to care for you, and instead, you hid something MASSIVE. For weeks. Because you just didn't want to deal with her.\n\nIt's callous, it's selfish, and it makes a mockery of your marriage. If I were your wife, this behaviour would shake the entire bedrock of the marriage.", "Yta.  Sorry bro.  Losing family is awful, but you have to share.  Even just to say you don't want to talk about it", "ESH. It\u2019s very strange that you wouldn\u2019t tell your wife your sister died or take her along to the funeral. On the other hand, her silent treatment now makes me think she isn\u2019t exactly a safe place for you to have emotions. I hope you both get help communicating.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't have to talk about your feelings with anyone. I'm not a big sharer of my feelings either. It doesn't help solve the problem and talking about things that make me sad just makes me sad, so I don't do it. So I totally get you not wanting to do that.\n\nHOWEVER, you lied to your wife. And not just a tiny \"yes that outfit looks nice on you\" white lie. A huge lie that included travel and a stay away under false pretenses. That's huge TA behavior. If I was your wife, I wouldn't trust you anymore. I mean, how can she? You lied about your sister dying, which in no way is harmful to your wife or your marriage. So if you'll lie about that, it stands to reason that you'll lie about things that would hurt your wife and/or your marriage (like fidelity, financial stuff, your health, etc.)", "You destroyed your trust with her, over something you really didn\u2019t need to", "alright thank you", "This is really the only answer you need to hear IMO", "yeah fair thank you", ">Soft YTA because you lost a sister.\n\nYou're calling OP a soft AH just because he lost a sister????", "alright thanks so much", "okay thanks man", "thank you", "thank you", "ok thanks", "I do understand where your coming from & I think I understand what you were trying to do. But \u2026. Lying to your life partner is not kind in any situation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to worry\u201d is not a valid excuse. That\u2019s the only thing that kind of makes you an ah. \n\nYour not an ah for not wanting to deal with your grief. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to deal with death. You have control of how you want to manage your feelings. If you don\u2019t want to talk about it that\u2019s okay. You can just say that. You have no control over other people though. Your wife is entitled to have her own feelings. You took that away from her. She deserves a sincere apology.\n\nGrief is a very strong & powerful emotion. You may never experience grief or it can suddenly hit you at any time. I truly hope you are able & willing to give yourself some grace for having some feelings, no feelings, whatever & talk about those feelings with someone."]}
