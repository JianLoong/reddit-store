You got the news, made travel plans, travelled, went to a funeral, came home, and at no time told your spouse that a member of your immediate family passed away.  Whether you were close to your sister or not, that's a major thing to deal with without sharing any of it with your *spouse.* \n\nWhen you said you were \"going to see your sister\" and chose not to include that it was for her funeral you lied by omission.

Another part of her is probably worried that if you didn\u2019t tell her about this, what other emotionally significant events are you keeping to yourself and probably worried about you.

You can\u2019t hide things from your spouse and this was a big deal. \n\nAlways be honest with your wife. My recommended approach would have been to tell her what happened and just been clear about what your needs were at the time. You can\u2019t control how worried she feels, but there would have been nothing wrong with asking her at the time to support you by trying to make her worrying less obvious. Let her know why - for example, perhaps it overwhelms you and stresses you out when she worries excessively.", "YTA\n\nYou lied to your wife. That\u2019s simply not okay, \n\nIt appears you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone about your feelings. Your wife, your brother, are both concerned about you. They are your family.

You would too, right? Instead you could have told her and tell her what you do need from her. You don\u2019t need her to constantly ask you if you\u2019re okay or check up on you every five minutes. But you might need her to understand why you\u2019re going for a long walk on your own (for example) or you might need a few days and th\u00e9n you\u2019ll talk to her.

You don't want to talk about your feelings, okay, whatever, you're emotionally constipated. Fine.

I don't blame you for that, but there are some people you always tell that someone has died. Your wife is top of that list.\n\nAll you've done is tell your wife that she isn't worth your time. The way you describe her 'constant worrying' isn't as something you can't handle but as something irritating, like she's nagging you. Your wife loves you and wants to care for you, and instead, you hid something MASSIVE. For weeks. Because you just didn't want to deal with her.\n\nIt's callous, it's selfish, and it makes a mockery of your marriage.

And not just a tiny \"yes that outfit looks nice on you\" white lie. A huge lie that included travel and a stay away under false pretenses. That's huge TA behavior. If I was your wife, I wouldn't trust you anymore. I mean, how can she? You lied about your sister dying, which in no way is harmful to your wife or your marriage.

Being emotionally unavailable is one thing but being so dismissive of your life partner that you are willing to go to such lengths to conceal something like this absolutely makes you an asshole. You didn't want to deal with her worrying but you never even gave her a chance to react, you just assumed the worst about her and shut her out preemptively. Finding people's demonstration of love for you annoying is probably not a great sign of your capacity to have a healthy relationship in general. \n\nGrief is personal and boundaries are acceptable but making a one sided decision that your wife is not allowed to care for you, or even know your whereabouts shows how little you respect her or value your relationship. If you lie about something like this, how lightly would you dismiss infidelity or financial impropriety? Does someone who has so little emotion have a conscience at all? These are complicated but fair questions (cut to Camus nodding vigorously in agreement.)\n\nShe deserves a partner to share life with, not someone who intentionally denies her the most basic human experiences and uses some bullshit cop out that reeks of toxic masculinity.

But I really don't think this is long term healthy for you.\n\nFurther, how long did you think you could keep this up without her finding out?  How did you see this playing out?  Would you have taken her to a family event 6 months from now and walk her into a situation where she's told by your siblings or parents and let her flounder as they realize she never knew?  Just never see your family again?  Clearly you weren't thinking ahead which I get given the situation, but honestly, this was not a good plan.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nYes, YTA.

And yes when it comes to partners I consider a lie by omission on the same level as an actual lie, In either case you are deceiving your significant  other intentionally and that is rarely justifiable.   \n\n\nThis wasn't a pregnant lady asking am I fat or  you them telling you they just planned a nice quite dinner for you two alone; when really there is a surprise party waiting at the restaurant.  \n\n\n This was an intentional selfish deceit to deflect having to be vulnerable.", "YTA and it\u2019s a giant red flag to your wife you can\u2019t even share something so big with her as this. \n\nMy mother used to hide big medical diagnoses until it was so urgent she had to tell me trying to protect me.

To hear it from someone else, is only lucky he did actually mention why or your family most likely could have judged her harshly and she would have had no idea at all. Not even a chance to message her condolences to your family members is extremely selfish of you. Is not just about you. I had a similar situation when I was younger and to this day still feel like a complete asshole. My mum dated a guy for a while and I went to school and was friendly with his daughter and son. I had no idea he was murdered and about a year later saw the daughter out and one of the first things I said was how was her dad? Her friend with her grabbed her and walked off I would\u2019ve looked like I was taunting her or completely uncaring of what happened all because my mum was too self centred to think we should know something important like that.

If it is, I wonder how much you actually feel or allow yourself to feel. Even your responses are short and cordial. I\u2019m not comfortable going with a straight YTA because there\u2019s too much unknown. Is this a pattern with you and your wife? Do you actually talk about real things like feelings? What was your relationship with your sister? Were you close? Is it just grief that you are feeling or is there guilt involved? Are you apathetic? No judgement, seriously. I don\u2019t think you intended harm but you caused it with your wife. Now you do need to not just apologize for lying to her but also talk to her about why you felt you needed to lie to her. Not excuses. Actual conversation. And you will need to reestablish trust.

WTF dude", "Yta because you need to deal with this strange avoidance of discussing your emotions. It was a lie when you told her you were going to see your sister. A lie by omission is still a lie. Would this not make her wonder what else you have not shared with her?", "I understand that you should be able to talk about it how you want. But iou can\u2019t excuse lying to your wife about going to the funeral. And she\u2019s your wife, you should be able to talk to her and she should be able to respect when you don\u2019t want to talk. And it\u2019s her job to worry about you.

Because keeping such news in secret makes absolutely zero sense.", "First, I want to give you my condolences for the loss of your sister.  I don\u2019t know what your relationship was with her, but it was significant enough that you attended her funeral.  Since you  asked if AITA, I think on some level you already have a clue.  You have some serious communication issues, not only with your wife but also with your family of origin (Not responding to your brother\u2019s texts or calls). Maybe it\u2019s not just about you.  Maybe your brother was reaching out to you because HE was seeking support from you or needed to discuss a family matter post your sister\u2019s death.  Maybe he only started to worry because you failed to call him back.  Maybe unconsciously you want people to worry about you because it\u2019s \u201csweet\u201d. (No need to deny but I\u2019m not as sure about that as you).  It is your behaviors that draws all this negative attention.  You are lying to yourself if you believe that you didn\u2019t lie to your wife (re visiting your sister).  That is complete nonsense and you purposely distorted the truth.  You presented it as though you were protecting your wife so she doesn\u2019t worry about you.  Are you fragile?  Maybe, you\u2019re unconsciously angry at your wife for not visiting your sister when she was alive. Due to self admission of not expressing your feelings \u201clike others\u201d , you may be a passive aggressive guy.  People around you seem to like you, but you don\u2019t handle conflict well.  I hope my response to you was enough conflict that you start doing something different.  This continued behavior can hurt your relationships. Don\u2019t minimize it.", "Dude\u2026 no judgement here but you really need to talk to a professional about things. This ain\u2019t a functional way of processing emotions or communication.", "I'm sorry for your loss, but yeah YTA. There's no reason that you couldn't have been honest about this. You could have told just your wife what happened but then expressed that you didn't want to talk about it. Instead you chose to tell lie about a major life event. I don't blame your wife for being upset or losing trust in you. If you can hide the death of a family member what else could you hide? Unnecessary dishonesty.", "Why the HELL would you not tell your wife something like that? Major, major YTA. I would be reconsidering the entire marriage if I was your wife. You apparently can\u2019t share your feelings with her and told a huge lie for no reason.", "YTA. You have a very sad marriage if you would keep something as important as the death of your sister from your wife. Of course your wife is quiet and upset. She is busy contemplating your future together. Your marriage is sad and empty.\n\nI have to wonder when you would have told your wife about your sister's death?

Of course she feels betrayed. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you would have mentioned this to a coworker. \n\nObviously, there is much more to this story than you are telling us. \nYou either have serious relationship issues, or wife is some type of monster that you need to   keep her in the dark.  \n\nYour behavior is not normal.", "YTA\n\n\n\nI'm sorry but your a mega one too.

But you at least tell her your sister died. You made it sound like a normal visit and not a funeral\u2026which is unusual. And I\u2019m sure that makes your wife have trust issues, in a way.

Have you talked to a therapist about your issues? You absolutely need to.", "Sorry for your loss but the problem doesn't really seem to be about your sister...it does seem, however, to be a 'connection' issue between you and the outside world, especially your life.

What's the point in it all then? Very soft YTA", "Soft YTA because what you did would feel like excluding me from the family if I were in your wife\u2019s position.

I was, and still know people, who are so emotionally isolated that it almost seems they don't feel or know how to feel. You are likely in incredible emotional pain (perhaps even unbeknownst to you) and may be suppressing it to continue to function, and protect and care for the ones you love the most. Though you may be trying to hide your feelings from your loved ones, it's very easy for them to see, eg: isolating from you're brother, and deliberately using grammar to be explicitly honest to your wife whilst also hiding the source of your pain.\n\nI'm only saying any of this because if this even in a small way resonates with you , I would recommend speaking to someone neutral who isn't close to you. For me that would always provide a huge relief, as I didn't have to worry about burdening my loved ones. If you're in the UK the Samaritans are incredible (116 123), or colleagues who you see very infrequently but connect with, or not-very-close friends, or better still - perhaps try a therapist? If you're anything like me (and forgive me for jumping to conclusions but your attitude \"it's sweet of her to worry, but I don't talk about my feelings\" is very familiar!) then it is incredibly likely that one day **ALL** of your feelings will come out at once and you will have zero control, and it's the worst.

These unspoken emotions are still present and will come out in other ways, such as headaches, not sleeping, getting angry about small unrelated things, finding it hard to concentrate at work, not being fully present in their home life, or finding it hard to listen to the emotions of others. \n\nIf that isn't the case for you and not expressing your feelings doesn't affect you, then stoicism may be a natural part of your personality, but you need to understand that this is rare - most people need not only to discuss their own feelings, but also to hear about the feelings of the people close to them, in order to be content. \n\nFor your wife, hearing about how you feel builds connection.

It lets typical points of bonding/mutual supportive reciprocal behaviours wither rather than grow closer.

Please respect that wish\"", ">That's *really not a good look.*\n\nYeah, for her, not for him.", "Yes, exactly. Whether OP thinks of it this way or not, his wife is a part of his family. Her parents-in-law lost their child, her sibling(s)-in-law lost a sibling. Even if she's not super close to them either, they might have liked to hear that she cared. Honestly, sometimes even having someone around who isn't in the deepest grief can be helpful, to provide support and get things done that might be overwhelming.", "Why even bother having a partner if you can\u2019t even communicate with them about major life events? Most people get married at heart because you WANT someone to be able to support you through good and hard times and hold your hand as you\u2019re dying. I feel bad for OP\u2019s wife.", "I\u2019m also wondering what he told his family about his wife not being at the funeral. I\u2019m sure they asked where she was. Probably another lie that wasn\u2019t really a lie.", "That or he's just numb.", "I appreciate that you took the time to write this lol", "I\u2019ll just say it, it\u2019s dumb as hell", "Yes. That is an important distinction.", "OP: \u201cShe was real quiet\u201d. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not a lie\u2026\u201d.", "I'm the sort who will stop and watch cops when I see two white ones handling a person of colour because where I grew up, they needed to be watched. I don't trust any cops to know what the law is or their jobs to be \"to serve and protect\" to include people who don't look like themselves.\n\nWhen I met my friend's brother this summer at his wedding, I finally met a young Sheriff who sounds just like Nat Glover. Young man was a wild child in his youth who decided to change the way things were handled by entering law enforcement and tidying up his local police (in Missouri). We had a few chats over the wedding, found a lot of common thoughts on the issues in the lack of accountability when there is corruption (both have a massive issue with the code of secrecy, hate the corruption and how it undermines trust in the process, hate the lack of ability to do anything about obvious cases when criminals are smart enough to just skirt under the limitations of the law). We had some friendly jousts about \"Defund the Police\" because he doesn't like the idea of zero funds to do his job as a war cry, but would love to see more funding into housing and education so that he doesn't see catch and release cycles into the neighbourhoods he goes into and the next generation being traumatized instead of being helped. \n\nThe world needs more Nat Glover's, I love finding them out there in the world.", "You can tell by her reaction that it would have been about her. Look at some of the highest rated comments in this thread; it's disgusting. They're all worried about how she feels about her image to the point they don't give a fuck that this man lost a sibling. First thought I had was that all he wanted a quiet drive to and from the funeral where he wasn't responsible for the emotional management of the people around him. All these people don't want him to have that.", "thank you - being a preschool teacher taught me to break feelings down to tiny bits & it has helped me *hugely* in my personal life, lol", "I\u2019m so confused how has any of this got to do with the original comment. It\u2019s literally just you talking about having autism and being physically disabled. \n\nI feel for you but I genuinely can\u2019t see the correlation between the two comments", "Yeah, how could she not?  This seems like clear evidence that her husband is totally fine with lying to her if that's slightly easier than telling the truth.  Tough to have trust in that situation", "I expect we'll see an AITA from the wife when that happens. Asking if she's TA for divorcing him over his keeping secrets..", "This is so accurate. My husband did the same, for years and he eventually had a complete breakdown. He\u2019s working so hard to recover, but it\u2019s a daily struggle for everyone.", "It\u2019s not going to blow up on him, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll blow up on her \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah. I'm dealing with childhood trauma now at an age of 34, it happened to me when I was 6-8 yo and I honestly thought I was fine. I never really saw a therapist or such and I didn't consider myself in need of one. Then we had our first kid, a boy, and it fucking broke me. I saw this small bundle of life and my protection instinct just went through the roof, he was my responsibility now and I would murder to keep him safe. I was not even close to ready for the emotional impact his birth would have on me, it led to a lot of fights with my wife as my brain just refused to react rationally to things related to my son. After one particularly bad fight I started looking inwards because I realized that my behavior was about to lose me my wife. I realized that my mindset and reactions came from my childhood and decided to seek treatment and also talked to my wife bout my theory (she already knew about my past so telling her why wasn't that hard after I realized myself) and she thanked me for being open and we set a plan for how to deal with situations triggering me until I felt ready to deal with them again. Just talking it through actually helped a lot and after 2 weeks I was able to do some of the situations again.\n\nThat said, that was a lot of trauma that to this day isn't fully dealt with, and I'm not sure I'll ever be rid of it all, but realising that it was still affecting me even if I considered it a thing of the past hit me hard, I did not want to open that can of worms again...", "I loved Falling Down too. Great movie.", "Or he\u2019s an emotionless robot which is another kind of problem.", "Right?\n\nIf you're not going to share it all from the get go, I can understand going to this funeral alone to handle the feelings first and then coming back and being honest with the wife. Perhaps to try and handle an emotional blow like this incrementally.\n\nBut like who the hell keeps a death like this as a personal matter?", "That's not necessarily true everybody deals with things in different ways. Some people just find it more comforting to shut themselves away for a Time deal with it and then come back better. I personally can't focus on my own emotions if other people are around me because I'm too focused on what they feel.", "I hadn't even considered how the wife must look to the rest of the family right now. Was OP honest with anyone when they asked why his wife wasn't with him? There's going to be a massive difference in how the family will view her going forward if the only two choices appeared to be \"she decided not to come and support me\" and \"I didn't bother telling her anything about this at all. \"", "Yes and made her look further like an AH for having to ask the brother \"why should I check up on him?\" \n\nTo the OP, YTA, why can't you be honest and communicate with your spouse? You not talking about feelings is its own issue, but this wasn't just feelings - it is a fact you went to attend your sister's funeral, and you lied about that to your wife. My condolences for your loss, please reconsider your approach with your wife if you want her in your life.", "There are A LOT of scenarios where discussing one's Feelings about a death in the Family with the spouse can be uncomfortable/not the first thing to focus on, but keeping the spouse in the dark about the fact that a death even occured, Just to avoid setting boundaries or acknowledging uncomforableness, is DEEPLY unhealthy and disrespectful.", "Right? When my dad passed, I didn't want to talk about it. My SO and my friends respected that wish by checking in and seeing how I was doing, trying to provide distractions, and making sure I was taking care of *myself* because they know that I tend to neglect my own needs sometimes. It was the same when my aunt passed the following month, except that time I felt the need to talk because her death was a suicide and it hit me hard. They listened, they didn't try to tell me that it gets better or placate me with hollow sympathy. They, again, made sure I was taking care of myself and provided distractions.\n\n\nPoint being, I told them because they deserved to know as people that are important to me and they're my support system just like how I'm part of their support systems.", "I\u2019ve seen him reply to and thank multiple YTA comments.", "Wasn\u2019t his reply in this thread to the YTA at the top of it? They said it was only \u201csoft\u201d because OP is grieving, and I didn\u2019t at all read it as agreeing with OP or his actions, just recognizing that there *is* more leeway given to people who are TA because of grief, even though it might not change the ultimate judgment.", "His relationship will fail if he doesn't stop acting like feelings are abnormal.", "Oh, I certainly don't blame him for that.  I didn't have an \"acceptable\" grief response at my father's funeral or at the shiva.  Dry as a bone.  My issue is the total lack of communication.  Unless the wife is a total Broadway show of drama, just saying \"there is a serious family issue I have to take care of\" rather than \"going to see my sister\" would have been sufficient.  Or \"my sister is ill, I have to deal with this for a few days\".", "I'm also thinking about how he's visited the sister before, but his wife never came with.\n\nBut when his sister *died*, he planned the trip and left with only a \"I'm going to see my sister\" and nothing else. Is this how his visits went, too? And that's why his wife never went with him, because he just planned a trip for one and dipped with a courtesy message to let her know where he went?\n\nChrist, OP's response to \"I wish you wouldn't bottle up your feelings\" is \"They're already bottled and I find it annoying that you, my spouse, care about me at all.\" What the fuck happened to OP to stunt his development so?", "Maybe OP has a depression and that's why he won't talk about his feelings and can't deal with replying to his brothers messages?", "There's a good chance family was told wife didn't want to come. And it's \"technically true\" (read: bullshit) because wife didn't want to visit sister, and was under the impression it was just a visit.\n\nAnecdotal, but the people I've known that justify their lies like this usually have a decent house of cards going in some way shape or form.", "alright thanks", "lol yeah OP doesn\u2019t give a fuck", "Because what they are saying is, your husband's big feelings may come from a place of taking your pain personally. That he was trying to connect with you in the only way he knew how to show he understood. Once you acknowledged that your husband's efforts to express his solidarity was understood and how you needed to be seen, he was able to start reeling in his response.\n\nA lot of Neurodivergent people have a desire to show they understand and are there to show solidarity in ways others find irritating or rude because they haven't been minimalized in major ways their entire life.\n\nIt doesn't take much critical thinking at all to see that the respondent is offering a connection. To say they understand what you mean, because they have similar reactions and where it came from in their own life, that might have been similar to your husband's experience.\n\nFor me for instance, the best way for me to understand other's feelings is to put myself in their shoes and feel their feelings. It has taken years to learn how to internalize it, but it is still the only way I know how to interact and if I see an answer I ask if they want ideas to help them through the situation.", "Then he shouldn't be married. If you can't find a way, any (healthy) way to communicate with your partner, you shouldn't be in that relationship (or any romantic relationship) until you figure out how to do so. All it takes is \"My sister died. I don't want to talk about it, I'll let you know if that changes.\" Say it, text it, write it on a post-it, anything is better than the lie.", "And the comments be like \"he's allowed to keep things to himself\" and \"Men aren't as emotional as you women!\"", "I'm not convinced he wasn't seeing a mistress during the trip.  Like yeah the trip could be for the funeral and all, but he could have been staying with a woman.  \n\nWhy else wouldn't he have brought her with him?   His reasoning makes no sense.  \n\nHe hates the way his wife is so he hides big moments in his life?  So why did he marry her?  \n\nEven best case scenario, this ends in divorce.", "I'm so sorry about your husband. That must be difficult. I wish him a speedy recovery (or what is the correct thing to say, English isn't my first language) \ud83d\ude4f", "My wife was the same for years- just refused to show any level of emotion. We almost divorced over  it several years ago. It's hard being with someone who appears  to be completely apathetic. \n\nFortunately she also worked on it and finally realized it was safe to be vulnerable with me. We lost two dogs within a couple weeks of each other and I had to be the one who was stoic and strong because she cried every single day. \ud83d\udc94", "That's what toxic masculinity is all about, sadly \n\nPretending the strong thing is running and hiding from emotions and letting them build up until you snap, harming those around you", "To me it sounds like he doesn't ever let his wife know how he feels about things. And how does he expect to have a relationship with her if that's the case? If he can't trust her enough to talk to her about his feelings? She's gonna worry herself sick if he doesn't say something.", "You\u2019re not wrong that everyone deals with things differently, but lying to cover up a major life event is a real red flag. The whole reason OP\u2019s wife found out was his brother (who has more years of understanding how OP deals with things than wife does) calling her because he was worried that OP wasn\u2019t responding to messages. That reads to me as sign that there is something to worry about on the mental health front.", "If he said to his family that he didn\u2019t want to bother telling his wife, I\u2019m sure his brother wouldn\u2019t have assumed she already knew her sister in law\u2019s death when he called the house.", "Ooof took me weeks to tell people my mom passed. There's still people who ask how she is.", "I would imagine his wife does too", "I just want to know HOW did OP end up married?", "I would think this would make it worse. OP has checked out of his marriage, and I don't think there's much he can do to save it after this. His wife won't leave him right away, but there's no way this lasts now that she realizes how little he cares to share with her. She likely feels she lives with a stranger.", "The person you are responding to is not me (it's my husband) I do understand about having big feelings diminished & physical disability - \n\n...not to get too deep, but my husband's folks taught him that he needs to react largely to their stuff to prove he cares about them. He was relieved when he heard me say that he doesn't have to do that with me. At the inlaws house the big feelings reign bc that makes his folks feel loved. It's all good.", "God, right?\n\nSorry for your loss, OP, but YTA in this situation.", "That\u2019s bullshit and whoever is saying that would\u2019ve thrown a major fit had their SO pulled this stunt on them. \nLike, op is telling us that he intentionally and deliberately left this detail out when he mentioned he was going to see his sister? Umm.. he has some issues he got to deal with if he thinks that\u2019s okay and requires validation for it too. Because it\u2019s not. \nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the wife had met her lots or just once, the late sister was immediate family of OP. She deserved to know.", "Thank you so much, your English is impeccable and you completely understand. It\u2019s not easy, but he\u2019s putting forth the effort. That makes all the difference in the world.", "You speak English eloquently. Don't let jerks give you shit for speaking multiple languages. They probably only speak one.", "The brother knows now that OP didn't tell his wife.", "Thank you. I imagine it's not, but if he's putting in some effort to get better that's all that matters. The road may be long, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.", "Knows now but not before meaning the rest of the family thought she knew already too aka damage was done aka he made his wife TA to his family which makes the OP TA", "And that\u2019s exactly it, put forth the effort and I\u2019ll support him forever.", "Yeah, even if he didn\u2019t explicitly say anything more than \u201cshe couldn\u2019t make it\u201d, he took her decision to send flowers/call her in-laws etc off the table, too.\n\nI could perhaps see if OP didn\u2019t attend the funeral at all, and so he just never told his wife because it didn\u2019t affect them. Still odd but more understandable.\n\nThe moment he had to \u201cnot technically lie\u201d is when he became an AH."]}
