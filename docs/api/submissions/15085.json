April and May have the same Father. He passed when May was 2. June is the result of a ONS, he pays support but rarely sees her. I work 3 jobs to keep us afloat and have told the girls we need to support each other to make it. The problem is April doesn't want to. I get it she's a teenager and wants to live life but I really need her help, either watching the girls or cooking, cleaning. Just little things.\n\nHere's where I was an asshole, I think. I found out she had a job. The bank sent some statements to the house, she does have an account and I'm the guardian. I read it and saw she would make withdraws after every deposit. Just enough to keep the fees away. I yelled at her for being selfish, how her sisters have had to miss out, how she could've been helping us. She screamed I took her entire childhood away and I won't take her future. The little ones were crying so I'm trying to comfort them and get through to April. She said she was leaving and I told her to stay away until she's ready to be a part of this family. \n\nFriends and family have called me an asshole who shouldn't have expected a child to be another pillar of the family. Some have said I was wrong but so was April, and that we need to compromise and maybe she pays me rent.

Reading between the lines, Im betting April spent a lot of her \"childhood\" being used by you as a free babysitter and housekeeper just because she was the eldest, and now shes had enough, and is rightly planning for her own future away from you and your demands. You \"found out\" she has a job, so presumably she didnt tell you, and you then went snooping and found her bank statements and read those and screamed at her for basically daring to spend some of her own money and not letting you get your hands on it.\n\nYou have THREE children...the oldest isnt there to prop up your failings to support the family, she isnt there to take on the responsibilities for your life choices that didnt work out for you.", ">>She screamed I took her entire childhood away and I won\u2019t take her future.\n\nYTA. I understand family pulling together and helping each other in tough times, but it sounds like you tried to rely on your eldest as if she were an adult when she was still a child.

Also April should NOT pay rent she's 17, it's your obligation to provide shelter for her. Once she's 18 if you want to make her pay rent that's your choice, but don't be surprised if she prefers to move out and not talk to you again, the relationship already seems to be straining.\n\nAlso your 5 year old should NOT help by cleaning.

I can tell your situation is difficult, but as her mother, you're meant to be taking care of her, not the other way around. \n\nI would be surprised if there weren't other reasons that she's doing this. I imagine she's withdrawing her money because she doesn't trust you not to take it. Fact of the matter is, she's working to earn it, so it's hers. She's a child and you're not entitled to her wages.\n\nDo you have family you can get help from? Are you in touch with April and May's paternal grandparents? Guilting your child about not handing over her wages is a dick move. And I'm fairly certain that you're not allowed to charge rent from your minor children. \n\nApologize if you want to have a relationship with her. Talk to her, find out what's wrong.

Not your teenage daughters.", "Yeah your other fam was right. It sounds like you're parentifying April.\n\nListen, I get it. I've been a single mom and I had to hustle. I also had talks with my kids about how we had to be a team and be there for each other. I did expect certain things from my oldest for sure. Within reason. But she also got to live her teenage life, hang out with friends and I would never ever *dream* of expecting her to help support our family financially. I like to think, in hindsight, we built a foundation on mutual respect and trust. Key word: mutual. \n\nYou're the parent and it's *your* responsibility to provide what your kids need. I'm sorry it takes three jobs to make that happen, but this is your life and you have to make the best of it. Two of your kids have experienced a deep loss, and you need to be an adult they can trust, not just for their physical needs, but emotional as well. It feels like April is somewhat of a commodity for you, but she is a person who needs *your* support, not the other way around. She may be 17, but she's still *your child,* and it's on you to look after her wellbeing. It also sounds like you're pitting siblings against each other, and that's not creating the atmosphere of teamwork that you desire. Your younger daughters now can't help but see your oldest as the bad guy here, because that's the narrative you created. Which is totally unfair! \n\nI can guarantee you April has been secretly working and putting money away in order to leave as soon as she turns 18. So at the very least, get ready to be out of a free sitter. And honestly, I can't blame her. You're the adult who put her in a position where she felt like she had to keep this from you.

Not the same thing.\n\nConsidering your reaction, it's no surprise she hid it from you.", "You have 3 jobs and still can\u2019t take care of your kids. You either need to get a different job or have a look at your budget. Do you buy unnecessary things like cigarettes, alcohol, takeaway food and coffee etc? Where is all your money going? You need to figure out a way to make it work without your daughters money because sounds like she will be leaving as soon as she gets the chance.", "YTA!\n\nHelping around the house with chores...yes\n\nTaking money she earned or charging her rent...heck no.  She's still a minor and you must provide for her. I suppose once she turns 18 (and miraculously doesn't move out immediately to get away) then you could talk about rent.\n\nShe's a child, NOT a 2nd parent!", "YTA you shouldn\u2019t have had a ONS resulting in a child if you can not afford to care for them. It\u2019s not your 17 yo\u2019s responsibility to pick up your slack. If you are in America you can not charge your minor child rent, it\u2019s illegal. That is solely your responsibility to provide for her. Are you not getting survivor benefits from ssi for your oldest two? That said she should be contributing to things for herself like if she has a cell phone bill, car insurance, savings for college or trade school. All 3 should have chores to help around the house.", "YTA. \n\nObviously, she didn't tell you she got a job because she knew you would feel entitled to her money. You aren't. \n\nExpecting her to give you her paycheck to use for her siblings is not the same as expecting her to do a few chores.\n\nI'm sorry you lost your husband, that sucks. But it was wrong to expect April to take on the responsibilities of a parent. It makes sense tbat you need help, but you should have gotten it from other adults. \n\nDon't be surprised if she doesn't come back. Why should she? She can pay rent elsewhere and not have you there trying to get her to mini-mom her siblings.", "Yta. First please allow me to express my condolences to you for the loss of your children's father. I'm sure it's very difficult - but it's not April's job to take his place. You are the adult and parent - she is not.\n\nYour idea of her helping with \"little things\" - is cooking, cleaning and taking care of the kids. That is ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with a child having responsibilities at home - so if what you mean is she had to wash the dishes or clean her room (all reasonable) - but the vibe I get is that she is responsible for all of it.\n\nAnd all you spend so little time with her that you didn't notice she had a job? That right there is enough for me to think this is fake.

You have two children now. April is seventeen years old. She's trying to get her shit together so she can stop being a burden on you once she hit eighteen.

Sounds like you're downplaying her actual involvement, and the second you learn she earned money, you want it.

May was 2 when her father died right? That means April was 11. So, at this point, neither of your younger children has even reached the age April was when you expected her to start helping out.
