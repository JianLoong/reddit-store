Me & my husband have been together for 10 years, married for 4. He has a medical card for our state & over the years occasionally partakes in edibles, which is still illegal here. I don't generally think it's a big deal.\n\nI found out earlier this year that I'll be going on a work trip to Vegas. My job pays for my hotel & flight, & spouses are allowed to tag along if they purchase their own flight.  I decided to get his flight & bring him with me, since neither of us have ever been, & this would basically be a free vacation for him. There are half a dozen other co workers going, & almost all are bringing their spouses as well.\n\nThe nature of the trip is a several day conference, from 8am to 2pm, & then having the afternoons & evenings free. Spouses basically are there to have a good time since they're obviously not attending the sessions. \n\nHusband is excited because he would like to spend the trip while under the influence of edibles. I said I was not ok with this for several reasons: we've had a few incidents in the past when he took took much (nothing major, thankfully, but scary and/or disappointing for me),  & this will be around my coworkers & spouses so I don't want anything bad to happen. I said I wouldn't mind if it was JUST us taking the trip, or if we had been there before, but I don't think its unreasonable to spend this particular trip sticking to drinks.\n\nNeedless to say, he is not happy, and says I am not in charge of him & that he'll be fine. I pointed out a previous instance of him having edibles while we were on a trip with my family out of state, when I didn't get to do an activity I wanted because he was too high. \n\nAITA for saying that if he insists on doing edibles I'm going to cancel his ticket & take the trip by myself?\n\nEdit: Edibles are legal in Vegas but not the state we live in. He doesn't want to travel with them, rather buy them & consume them there.", "created_utc": 1686241401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144dqfy/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_have_edibles/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may not in charge of your husband but you certainly are on charge of your business trip. If your husband can not make the distinction between a what is acceptable behaviour during a vacation vs a business conference, he needs to stay home. The last thing you need is office gossip about your husband the stoner. It will reflect badly on you and it's unprofessional.", "He's shown he can't be trusted of not overdoing it.  This next time, it might be in front of your boss, or offend a co-worker and it get back to your boss.  This might affect your career.  Further, you clearly don't want to hang out with \"Stoned BF\" all week, and I don't blame you.\n\nCancel his flight.

His behavior will reflect upon you, especially if he gets so high he is incapable of functioning and it could impact your career. While he is correct that you're not the boss of him, his petulance when being presented with a reasonable boundary based on his past behavior does not bode well for him respecting this boundary. Give him the choice either he does not consume edibles on this trip or he stays home.", "Huge stoner here. NTA. Originally wanted to say Y T A since he has a med card, weed is legal recreationally in Nevada, and there are huge gaps in time where your husband will be free to do what he wants.\n\nBUT, weed (and especially edibles) affects people very, very differently. If your husband has a med card for legit reasons and you're preventing him from accessing his medicine, OR he was able to handle his edibles (even if he just got a little goofy) and wanted to have a little fun away from your coworkers I would say YWBTA. But if he wants to partake purely recreationally AND he has shown that he cannot handle his edibles and it turns you into his caretaker, then you are NTA, especially since you will be around your coworkers.", "NTA - I don't think it is unreasonable to not want your SO to be shitfaced in front of your work colleagues. \n\nIt is that simple.

You should leave him home.  This can have serious negative effects on you job if he is too high and you run into colleagues.\n\nHe is being a jackass.  The right move for him would have been asking about staying an extra night to experience Vegas on edibles after everyone else leaves; or deciding not to do anything and stocking up for home at the legal dispensaries.  His plan is just completely irresponsible to your career.", "NTA for the concern on various fronts. Including that flying with weed could be generally problematic since there is still a federal ban.  Which then could affect his career. \n\nThe fact that he is insistent about being under the influence on the trip sounds like *medication* isn't the main factor here. The past event where he was \"too high\" on vacation is another strike.", "NTA. He is the AH since he doesn't care that his behaviour on that trip  will have repercutions on your job.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds incapable of moderating his dose so he shouldn't be doing this on your work trip.\n\nSource: long term medical user, prefer edibles myself.", "NTA since this is a business trip and he clearly can\u2019t handle edibles since you\u2019ve had incidents with him in the past.", "NTA, im a dutch pothead, but would NEVER be stoned around my husbands coworkers on a work-related trip!!

I honestly would be worried about being too high and in a new environment that potentially things could happen like getting robbed.", "NTA. A couple things to know-\n1. Though you mentioned you haven\u2019t seen him drunk, remember that in Vegas you can drink for free while gambling and it\u2019s very easy to go overboard, especially with the giant drinks and walking everywhere with liquor is okay. \n2. There are literal pop ups EVERYWHERE with \u201cnot weed\u201d edibles on the strip- and even \u201ccanna slushees.\u201d We are pot heads, we did not try any of them because were used to thc and picky from a fully legal state, but beware that it\u2019s there. \n3. If he DOES go and ignore your requests, thc is ridiculously expensive and getting to an actual dispo takes an Uber or a car. But the knockoff whatever they sell everywhere might be worse than real thc, and the edibles taste like butt in Vegas. \nI think, I\u2019d it\u2019s really something you don\u2019t want to happen, you definitely shouldn\u2019t bring your husband at all. Considering how disrespectful he is of your opinion already, he may put your career in jeopardy. And I say this and I hit my dab rig, so no judgment to potheads. Also- he definitely needs to learn dosing. Because getting lost in your own bedroom from weed is surreal", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to do edibles in Vegas maybe he should try getting his own job to pay for his own trip, unrelated to possibly messing with your career.\n\nIf he has that already... there's nothing stopping him.", "Info - so, it's the first trip to Vegas for you and for your husband, and he wants to spend the *entire* time high?  Why?  I mean, I understand that people use them, but the entire time?  I'm just thinking about all the things that he won't be able to do or appreciate if he's high the whole time he's there.", "NTA. He will have other opportunities to partake. On a work trip with your coworkers is not the time, and he sounds like a spoiled child.", "NTA\n\nI'm not a big supporter of weed being legalised that being said it sounds to me like your issue is his inability or lack of effort to take it in moderation which is a completely fair concern to have.", "NTA but you know even if he agrees not to, you\u2019re now going to be worried about him the whole time\u2026", "NTA he is risking your work reputation and even your job. His behaviour will reflect on you, as you brought him on the trip and he is your husband. So he either stays home or he can come and not take any drugs the whole time.", "NTA. Your business trip is not an excuse for a bender. I would rescind the offer for him to come with you.", "NTA- you need to be firm on this. The risk of him embarrassing you in front of co-workers is high and he has clearly made up his mind that your feelings on the subject don\u2019t matter.", "NTA. This is a work trip and his behavior will reflect on you.", "NTA - it can cause career ramifications for you since this is a work trip if things do go bad - choosing to possibly jeopardize your career for a little high is messed up. Not to mention that it seems like an abuse of his medical card. It\u2019s supposed to be so he can get medicine he needs to feel better - not for getting wasted out of his mind", "NAH \n\nTotally understand your feelings on this, it\u2019s work ffs. If it was my work colleagues then I\u2019d have no issue being legally high around them, but that\u2019s not his call to make as they are your work colleagues. Also, he\u2019s shown before that he\u2019s a total lightweight that can\u2019t handle it, the chances of it ruining your trip or holding you back on some way is clear and a real possibility.\n\nFor his side though, I\u2019m a fan of weed, it\u2019s also legal in my country medically now, and I have a prescription, for real reasons, which I\u2019m happy to share but not gonna bore you with otherwise. Before it was legal I still used it. But was hard to come by. And I was of the opinion that that law was manifestly unjust. So if there was an opportunity to easily and safely obtain weed on a holiday (Amsterdam for instance, love that place) then you\u2019re gonna get excited about it. Not just cos you can do the thing you like doing but are unable to do, but also because you feel like you can truly be yourself instead of the norm where you are a person who is persecuted by your own society. Which frankly kinda sucks. So I get the appeal for him and why he is so keen.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to really say definitely what I think should happen. But I really think you guys need to both accept the others viewpoint and try find a compromise. If he won\u2019t smoke it with tobacco then there are some great vape options these days. With the vape the hit is near immediate so much less risk of overdoing it. And there are of course a few other options as well. Eating it is a gamble, because of the hour or more it takes to get in your system. And because it is so so easy to just pop another one in your mouth. Which you both know all too well", "NTA, but I would try a compromise instead of your idea which is just doing a different drug(alcohol).", "NTA\n\nWhenever a partner is joining a work trip they should listen and respect the workplace culture as defined by the partner whose job it is.  You are completely correct that this trip is not an appropriate time to be under the influence, especially considering issues you've had before when he's used. \n\nWork trips are work.  If he wouldn't show up to your work Christmas lunch under the influence he should not indulge on a work trip.  \n\nYou need to be frank with him and say that either he can follow your lead on appropriate behavior for your work trip or he cannot attend.  Make sure he understands that there are legitimate concerns and how his choice to be under the influence could negatively impact your job and/or your workplace relationships.", "INFO: Would you feel different if he wanted to spend a significant portion of the day drunk?", "I mean.... as someone who has regularly consumed and still consumes cannabis in all forms, I'm somewhat baffled here, frankly.\n\nCan you husband just... not take way too many edibles? Like jeez man, pretty simple solution here. Take 10mg, maybe 20-30mg worth depending on your tolerance, and have a good time being happy and awake and alert. Don't take 500mg and be catatonic around your wife and her coworkers.\n\nI see a lot of comments on here from people who have clearly never used cannabis before (that is ok, don't get me wrong), I can assure you that I've spent entire vacations under the influence and still gone to all the activities, everything from hiking up a mountain to rounds of golf to playing poker or going to a waterpark, whatever. Husband failing to attend activities before is an issue of him not knowing his limits or being able to control himself, not just because he ingested cannabis. Responsible use is not a problem.\n\nThis all to say, it sounds to me like husband has a tough time not overdoing it and/or doesn't understand his limits, and has had issues in the past, so because of that, I say NTA. It's a reasonable request not to be too high to function around your coworkers and their spouses, even allowing for \"VEGAS!\" shenanigans.\n\nI will say, however, that I think YWBTA if you prevented him from doing it *at all.* A little bit of weed should not put you to a state where you cannot speak or interact with others, go to events, etc, and it is Vegas. Hell, your coworkers might even indulge themselves, do you know for sure they don't? Take the situation as it comes, but if I was you, I'd be telling my husband to just take it easy during the day and when you're with your coworkers, and save the stronger edibles for after dinner when it's starting to get loose anyway.", "No, NTA.

My reading comprehension is just fine, thank you. It is sufficient for me to clearly identify you as the AH here.", "4th paragraph of post, last sentence.", "How much is he taking at a time?  I usually will take a 10mg edible when I get home from work and I still go out all the time.", "Ohhh you\u2019re a boss babe! I certainly am not, I\u2019m a stoner lol. Don\u2019t listen to me. I hope your hubby falls in line and behaves. It does sound like to could end up being a big problem for you if he doesn\u2019t so good luck!!", "Maybe you guys can compromise? Like he can only take edibles at night after a certain time or something? I mean, you\u2019re not wrong in worrying about how this would affect him socially, but ultimately it\u2019s his choice.", "It sounds as though he has no interest in spending time with you and is just taking advantage of the free trip to get high. In which case why would you even want him along on the trip?", "NTA then, completely unreasonable.", "You might want to edit your original post, since it still says you think OP is TA and you\u2019ve currently got the top-voted post.", ">Right, but I thought you weren't supposed to drink while high\n\nNo, but literally thousands of people visit the Las Vegas strip/downtown and are drunk 100% of the time they are exploring the area.\n\nI think everyone should visit Vegas at least once in their life, if for nothing more than to see the incredible display of excess. I would say it depends on the person whether they think there are incredible places to explore or not. I don't spend time on the strip/downtown when I'm there because I have family there and we enjoy exploring the more natural areas.", "Hahaha basically it means people put weed into something you can eat, like a gummy or a brownie. Gets you high without having to smoke a joint.", "LMAO let my mans have a snack!", "They also mentioned in another comment that he is a big guy and doesn't really get drunk, so their concern is for the overindulgence of weed, which he has done in the past.", "Got it, thanks", "A LOT. A friend got him a 1,000mg Wonka Bar & said to take it in dime to nickel sized pieces- he took two quarter sized pieces and also smoked. It was a bad time.", "He doesn't need to \"behave\", he's a grown ass man not a child. I posted on here to get perspective. If you don't like clapbacks, dont start sh*t. Go back to chatting about the royal family, or something else vapid, where the bar is super low & I'm sure your opinions are perceived as intelligent.", "Ultimately it's her choice to set restrictions on his participation in her work trip.", "Didn't realize that there was some magic that happened in this sub based on the acronyms you use and the order you use them. TIL. Fixed. Thanks.", "Behaving by your standards I mean. Isn't he not allowed to take edibles while on your work trip? He better not, that's all I am saying. And I was just offering my own perspective, if you don't want my opinion, or think it's too vapid and I'm not intelligent enough to speak to you, then my sincere apologies. Everyone can agree you have proven you are better than me. I'll stick to hating on Harry & Meghan where my stupidity can thrive.", "YTA. He's a grown man with hours to kill waiting for you. You're fine with him drinking but not edibles. Despite that alcohol kills people regularly and edible kill no one. Poor guy...", "YTA. There are hours you're not even going to be with him because you're working. He should be able to have an edible while you're busy. I read a lot of the comments before re-reading your post and I think most of you and the people commenting are overreacting a smidge. If you have a whole work days worth of time to be away because you're busy, he has a whole works days worth of time to get high and sober up. There is no reason he can't get a not-so-potent edible to eat and come down from by the time you're done with whatever it is you're doing. Vegas has dispensaries everywhere that can provide him with whatever he needs, but nothing so strong he is on his ass for hours and hours on end.", "NAH. Can you just, not babysit him? Like, he does too much, okay that\u2019s his problem. He\u2019s an adult and you can spend time with your coworkers. His inability to control himself shouldn\u2019t be your problem. If there are consequences for him, maybe he\u2019ll learn his limits.\n\nI get where both of you are coming from, but there seem like a few ways to compromise. Him using less, you doing your own thing, you having specific plans that he needs to be sober for, etc.", "YTA. Stop being so controlling. You are free to drink and he should be free to eat edibles if thats his thing. He's a grown ass man.", "NTA \n\nThis is a work trip. Wanting your husband to not be stoned out of his mind is totally reasonable", "Sounds like he's risking your job.", "NTA. This is first and foremost a work event. If he wants to do edibles then suggest he stays at home and does them, rather than coming and potentially causing an issue that will impact your career", "NTA. I've never understood people who want to visit a place but spend the whole time zoned out. He can do that at home. \n\nIn this situation, he is basically representing you in front of your co-workers. He should be wanting to be on his best behavior. It's no different than spending the whole trip drunk.", "NTA. Just don't bring him then. It's his choice - he'll either come as a supportive spouse or not come at all.", "So, basically your husband is either an addict or extremely immature. Why would any reasonable person think it\u2019s okay to take substances (legal or not) during a business trip? \n\nEven if it\u2019s a holiday for him, it\u2019s a business trip for you and he needs to be mature about it and behave properly in front of your co-workers.\n\nWhy is he so insistent on spending a trip to Vegas high on substances anyway, is there nothing else to do in Vegas for heaven\u2019s sake?\n\nNTA but your husband probably needs intervention.", "\u201ehusband is excited because he would like to spend the trip while under the influenece of edibles\u201c\n\nman i love weed but you organize all of this for him and that\u2018s what he\u2018s excited about? NTA, what a loser.", "NTA.  This is a work trip.   Spouses' behavior on these sorts of trips can have a big impact on the way colleagues view a person.  Having a problematic spouse can be career-limiting.", "Info: what industry do you work in?", "NTA but why doesn't he just smoke or get a resin pen?? Much easier to control. I'm a daily smoker who will eat 60-100mg of edibles at a time but I wouldn't take any edibles if I knew I had to behave", "Why doesn\u2019t he just smoke a joint? Much easier to control than edibles.", "I mean if he's off on his own whatever, YTA if you are policing that.  \n\nBut with your coworkers there? NTA wtf how dumb is your husband", "It sounds like he doesn\u2019t know when to stop with the edibles, so NTA. Smoking and edibles hit me pretty differently, but I know when I need to be functional and when I can just have couch lock and be an idiot. It sounds like his only speed is idiot with them. If he would agree and actually be trustworthy enough to stick to low doses, I\u2019d say you were a bit of TA, but he probably won\u2019t. He could jeopardize your entire career by making an ass of himself.", "The palm tree speaks the truth\n\nIf your husband doesn\u00b4t normally take edibles, and has taken too much before, you should not be around coworkers and spouses for a trial run\n\nthe famous \"these edibles aint shit\" then it hits when you are all out to dinner or something has happened to the best of us\n\nAt best you have to babysit him and at worst he does something that your coworkers and spouses are not going to let you forget\n\nNTA", "As a fellow stoner, best answer right here", "Yeah, the two of them need to hit the dispensary, purchase NO MORE THAN 10mg (or whatever his upper dose is) and leave with just that.  Or maybe not drink? Kinda sounds like he just got crossfaded these other times.\n\nAnd yeah, I dunno why he'd be hanging out with her co-workers, it's a *work* trip... even assuming a company happy hour with plus-ones and another classy date night, there's still plenty of time to get high as balls and come down.\n\nAlso to the \"lol he just wants a free trip to Las Vegas to do drugs\"... yes, that's Las Vegas' whole raison d'\u00eatre.", "Shh, the adults are talking.", "You should also probably mention that in addition to *state* laws, there are also *federal* laws, and federally weed is still illegal.", "Do you know the strain that works for him? Could you guys find that specific one?", "She listed one incident with edibles. *one.* Find me one stoner who hasn't had that experience.", "Stumbling drunk around the strip is not the only thing to do in Vegas. You can take exotic cars out on a racing track. You can ride dune buggies. You can rip through the canyons in a two seater airplane. Tons of things to do that you're missing out on if you're drinking or getting high 24hrs a day.", "I mean, technically yes it's illegal and technically yes people could get busted, but people fly with marijuana *alllllllllllllll the time*- that wipe test is for explosives.  And even if they *do* find weed, they're probably just going to refer you to the local PD, who may or may not care.", "I listed three but that's OK, I understand if counting isn't your thing.", "Try rereading the whole story buddy. She is only worried about the weed because last time he used he over indulged. You are reading way more into that single sentence than needed.", "She's working on a work trip.  He *should* be finding his own ways to entertain himself.", "Lol okay 3 incidents. Sorry I didn't care to read all the hot air you blew. I don't really care.  You still treat your grown husband like a child. Take away his ticket.

I'd get it annulled before the authorities find out.  \n\n\nBut seriously, I'd tell him that it's a matter of trust and that your job is very important to your family.  Since he can't agree to just skip that one thing in order to enjoy all the rest, you'll have to leave him behind this trip and he can enjoy his edibles the next time you two can get to Vegas for a purely fun trip.", "NAH. This is 'your thing', so you deserve some amount of control... especially since you will be around coworkers. \n\n*That being said*, I don't think this is a position you *should* have and I don't find it reasonable. If he gets too fucked up, you leave him in the hotel room by himself while you go do stuff with your coworkers. You don't need to be his babysitter... there is no reason that him being high should prevent you from doing things you want to do. That's really the worst-case scenario, you leave him alone in the hotel room. Which is not super different from you leaving him at home. So I don't really see why you have such an issue with this.", "NTA. You're NOT on vacation, you're on a work trip. You will be with work colleagues.

You ARE in control of him this time.", ">Weed (especially edibles) affects people very, very differently. \n\nThat's so true, even just getting a different brand of edibles or a different flavor of the same brand can have a different effect on people. \"Low and slow\" is a saying with edibles for a reason after all.", "seriously, he reminds me of me and my friends in college trying to get older kids to buy us alcohol. hard to believe this guy is a full grown adult and not a bratty teenager", "Not relevant.", "Sure it is and parties to a dispute generally don\u2019t determine relevance. \n\nBased on your replies it seems like you\u2019re just seeking affirmation as opposed to any kind of thoughtful response.", "Yeah, I've had the wipe test for explosives, too. But this particular time they asked my coworker if she had marijuana while they were testing. Could have been just being dicks about it, though. Also I'll admit things may have changed since it's legal in a lot more states now. Back then I was doing a lot of travel in and out of Oregon and Colorado, so there was probably more concern around drug tourism back when this occurred.\n\nThough I'd personally not want to risk missing my flight because I've been pulled aside.
