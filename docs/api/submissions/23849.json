He has been reading tons of books about history and asking us to visit museums since he was a kid. It was no surprise to us that he wanted to major in history in college. He got accepted into the history program at NYU and is attending this fall. My husband and I were all really excited and wishing him the best of luck.\n\nSo, last night, we gathered with my in-laws for dinner but things went off the rails quickly. As we were waiting for our meal, my mother-in-law said something along the lines of \"Sam, you should really reconsider. History is nice as a hobby, but you need to focus on something more practical for your future.\"\n\nI tried to stay polite and composed, as we are used to my in-laws\u2019 way of thinking, and simply told her that history is Sam\u2019s passion and I believe that he will be able to make a successful career out of his degree.  \n\nThey did not drop the topic and my father-in-law began talking about stable income and job security. My husband and I tried multiple times to end the conversation naturally and divert the topic, letting them know that Sam has always been een incredibly hardworking so we do not believe finding a job will be a problem for him, we do not want him to be stuck doing a degree/job he hates, etc. \n\nMy in-laws apparently did not want to have a nice dinner so they kept pushing the issue. I started to get fed up when they wouldn\u2019t stop, and I ended up yelling at them in a angry tone that the decisions Sam makes were his and only his to make and that they could either support him or not. After that, they let it go but there was still tension among us for the rest of the dinner.\n\nWe made an excuse to leave the dinner early, thinking they would forget about it by the next day, but I\u2019m starting to feel worried that I might have caused a rift in the family by standing up for my son. My in-laws are usually very kind and supportive but they have very strict views on college educations, so I suppose this was inevitable. I do not regret what I did, however, but I\u2019m just wondering if maybe I could have handled it differently. \n\nMy son often browses this subreddit and shows us some of the more haywire stories that are posted, so I figured it might be a good idea to see what others think. Am I the asshole for defending my son's decision and standing up to my in-laws at the family dinner?", "created_utc": 1691136882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15htyf3/aita_for_standing_up_to_my_inlaws_when_they_made/", "score": 642, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should have dropped it sooner. You were defending your son. Also, Indiana Jones -  he was a historian.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for supporting your child.

I feel like older generations trying to weigh in before he's had even one semester have got to know it's anybody's game here. \n\nPlus, since when is history not a respectable field for advanced study?? Plenty of history grads go into law. It's not like performance art! They've been studying history since there was any, all the great societies. The way modern living has changed since those in-laws were in college -- studying history makes it possible to see all that chaotic disruption as a moment in time on a long scale. We need people in our future who know history. And society will benefit from any career good enough to have Sam. (Congratulations to you parents and to Sam.) (Tell him to take something out there with an elective credit--i had student jobs in the agriculture school and supplemented my humanities degree with a curiosity about things I might have chosen to study if  I'd been aware of them. Everyone I knew who took a class they couldn't believe was even something that's a subject really valued those glimpsed as what else is out there.)\n\nI know plenty of people who chose their career early on and have found financial success. I know plenty of people like me who considered our futures based on what we made of the opportunity to get a proper education. I've thought at times I'd have appreciated a strong guidance toward something highly bankable and might have a better now, but I never regret the education I did have the luxury to receive. I chose then to learn about the world I want to live in, and I have largely avoided compromising my values in my fifties. I prefer to see myself in the mirror this way. The feeling can't be bought or sold. \n\nThere is plenty of time for Sam to discover his path and smoke who wants a vote before he's even on campus needs to get right.", "NTA.

Especially when they are young adults making their first independent steps in the world:  Their decisions and the consequences of these decisions...

Jobs they probably never heard of.  \n\n\nSo - way to go for sticking up for your son.  \nIf raising your voice and losing your patience causes a rift - it's sad news about the strength of the family ties.  Who doesn't 'lose it' now and then and things get patched up?    \nIf your in-laws keep this life long obligation to have your wife's back, and support HER decisions, than this should not cause a rift.  Their daughter after all supports her son's decision, right?", "NTA. They refused to back down when you tried to be polite and tactful about it.

They're AHs, on a personal level for not respecting a boundary you insisted on maintaining and in the context of the greater good.", "NTA - good for Sam! Anyway, if he doesn\u2019t end up working in his field, most companies I\u2019ve worked for didn\u2019t care what people\u2019s degrees were in, as long as they had one.

Not able to strike through now on the Reddit app but I will leave my comment up.\n\n\nI think NAH.\n\nYou are right to defend your child and they are right to talk about the practicalities of life. Both are valid viewpoints.\n\nSam will (most likely) not have the same financial stability they would if they studied law or engineering, that is not to say the journey of studying the topic will not empower Sam to be successful elsewhere, or even focus on financial success, Sam may be fulfilled being a researcher or a teacher/lecturer.\n\nI would recommend you speak to Sam again and suggest they speak to someone in careers advice.", "NTA - but be aware NYU is taking you guys for a ride. Armed with a history major, he isn\u2019t going to be making much money. \n\nHe will have to change his career direction to a field where there\u2019s money, I mean this is if he wants to be able to buy a house and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. \n\nThere are high chances he will end up working in a field nothing to do with his major to make money and those 4 years worth of tuition is down the drain. \n\nUnless ofcourse he keeps sticking to finding a role in his major, then be prepared to partially fund him for a long time since he isn\u2019t going to be making enough money", "I'm leaning towards YTA.  \nYou call it standing up to your in-laws and defending his decision but context is important. Without knowing what was said and how it was said, this situation can be interpreted in a lot of ways. For one, it doesn't sound like they were being hostile or condescending at all. It sounds like they were trying to have a legitimate conversation regarding your son's choice of education... and they have valid concerns. You're paying a lot for education nowadays and a history major doesn't sound very promising as a career choice. I know you're happy for your son but have you even considered this? Have you seen what careers a history major gets you? Did you have any real discussion with him or did you let him decide and jumped on board without question? I mean, if he's young he's probably just taking what looks interesting and not what has potential. This could be a student debt story in 5 years.  \nEither way, everyone's just talking here and no one was trying to put down your son or make him feel bad. It's not like career choice is a taboo subject either. Why not let your son speak for himself? Again, everyone's just talking here.  \nContext is everything. Maybe your in laws really were getting a bit offensive. But getting this upset because people questioned your son's choice of career path sounds a bit odd. It sounds like you greatly over-reacted. It also sounds like you're a bit too overprotective.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When everything else fails, sometimes you need to be direct for people to get it. And as I understood you were still polite about it.\n\nMaybe because you're familly, they felt entitled to push the matter that far, but it should also be the reason why they should let it go now since they made their point. If there will indeed be a rift, it's really not on you, it's normal to let family share their point of view, but not that normal for them to push it that far. So it's ok to hear them out, you never know what ideas might spark interest, but in the end it has to be Sam's decision.\n\nAnd there are many careers a history degree will come in handy, for example I have friends that ended up in politics. Others are in research, or working in museums and travel the world. And no matter what happens in the future, even if he end's up not liking it, or struggling, it's never too late to start over in another field. \n\nIf you still feel the need to find out more about what you can do with a history degree in your country/area, it might be helpful to find graduates with history degrees, and they might offer a better view on the options out there after graduation or options/programs to attend during college.", "NTA. While I get the concern the in-laws have (these days society seems to look at college education in terms of earning potential rather than, y'know, an education), if you stated that you and your spouse were fully supportive of Sam studying history then that should have been the end of the matter. I give the in-laws a pass on initially questioning it as they're family -- if it had been friends they'd have been politely told to mind their own business, but they should have dropped it after the first conversation.\n\n/my sister has a history degree and went on to have a rewarding career.", "NTA  You are never wrong for standing up for your child. There are any number of careers that can be started with a degree in history. Heck, maybe he'll even be the next curator of the Smithsonian museum.", "NTA\n\nIT would be okay if they dropped the topic once it was made clear you want to stop it, honestly asking /showing concern is okay, but grilling people when they're obviously uncomfortable, trying to change/end the conversation is just plain rude.\n\nBeing as it may be, the yelling was maybe bit too much. Next time just calmly, but very openly inform them, that if they don't mind, you would like to drop that topic otherwise you would regret making the dinner shorter than anticipated. .. If they refuse to drop it you just excuse yourself fro the dinner. Simple as that.", "NtA. You can't make a career about of being a historian? Are they serious? Try working in any of the museums in the UK or the stately homes without having a decent grasp of history outside of the gift shops and cafes. No chance of being a tour guide in London or the big cities without knowing your history and I take it they've never watched Who do you think you are?

If there is a rift in the family, you are not the one who caused it.", "Well, letting it escalate to the point of yelling at your in laws was probably not the best moment of the evening. However, I do applaud you for supporting your son by trying to explain his passion for history and his drive to be able to really immerse himself in this. It will be very exciting to be in a program with so many other people (students and professors) who share his fascination with history. And let me congratulate him on being accepted at NYU! That\u2019s no easy feat. The experience of living in NYC is a learning experience of its own. He will be exposed to all sorts of different people and viewpoints, he sounds like a deep intelligent thinker (comes with the territory of loving to learn about history). I don\u2019t know where you live, if it\u2019s near NYC or not but it\u2019s a fantastic and inspiring city to live in. The West Village where NYU is primarily located is a wonderful neighborhood, community oriented, charming, has nice parks (Washington Square Park is right there). There are so many museums of different types there, at least 20 that I know of, probably more. He will thrive there in many ways because he has a curious mind. And socially there is so much to do too, great public transportation, all sorts of wonderful restaurants and cuisines (many affordable on a student budget too!) All good things. He obviously should pursue this. You and your husband are really great for your support. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll talk about it with your in laws at some opportune time. It will be ok.", "You didn\u2019t cause a rift in the family by standing up for your son. Your in-laws caused a rift by not letting the subject drop/pushing the subject multiple times.

The world will always need history teachers etc though", "That's not standing up for him. Nowhere in her story does she say the son was having any issues or was uncomfortable. This is totally her projecting and overparenting. Why is she talking for him to the point where now she now has drama with her in laws because they questioned his career choice? She had the problem. She was insecure.", "Like I said, if the parents want to subsidise him for a long time, that\u2019s fine. If you\u2019re in the UK, you know how much teachers are paid.

Sam is about to start college; he's nearly an adult.  He should be prepared for people to second-guess his decisions and be firm/confident about them nonetheless--and honestly, *any* college major choice is a big enough decision that there will be moments of uncertainty.

It makes me wonder if you are projecting your own insecurities about this decision, if there's some tension arising from your/your husband's education/careers vis-\u00e0-vis your in-laws' and/or if there's a cultural thing at play (i.e., are your in-laws immigrants?).  It also sounds like you had a bigger problem with the interaction than Sam himself did, and a few phrases here and there suggest you may be a helicopter parent.\n\nMost comments here seem to be judging based on whether people think history is a good choice of college major, but I think that's not the point.

Some history majors become librarians or they get jobs working for national or state parks. My cousin was a history major, and she works for a state park running youth programs and giving historical tours of the park.\n\nOthers end up working at historical museums. They can become archivists, specializing in upkeep of historical documents and items. Some specialize in specific periods of history and become experts in that period/field. That kind of specialization can help them get a job that pays pretty well.\n\nNone of this will make him a millionaire, but they\u2019ll be careers.\n\nThe biggest drawback is they have to go where the work is.

His degree will open many doors for him.", "Unless they're rich or go to an affordable public college, ANY college grad is going to be in debt, regardless of major. And with the way student debt is structured, you're going to be paying exploitative interest for decades. It's such a scam, regardless of what you study or what job you get. Maybe if more people had better critical thinking and communication skills, there'd be some meaningful reform. Now where to get those skills...", "Our higher education is very different from the American system, so I have to ask- how do you go from a history degree to being a software engineer? Don't you need a Bsc in engineering?", "Every day is vacation when you love your occupation- dirty heads", "As I wrote in a different comment, our higher education system is very different from the American system, so I guess I see things differently. We are enrolling into a specific BA or BSc from the start (and if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor you study law or medicine, not start with some general studies). \n\nThe debt part of your comment just made me sad...", "No, companies don\u2019t require it. Having a computer science degree helps, but as long as you have done projects and internships, you can compete.\n\nSeveral of my coworkers also studied random things in college and then went to coding bootcamps and became developers. They\u2019re usually better communicators and more organized than the ones who studied only one thing in their life.\n\nSoftware engineering tends to be a field with a high number of self taught individuals, so companies are open to a greater variety of formal educational backgrounds.", "Absolutely agree with the last portion here about basic coding and excel, etc. That's easy enough to learn with YouTube videos and udemy.", "Absolutely. I'm working on my master's degree in library science now and am SO envious of the kids at my university who are majoring in it! They're going to be where I am now, right out of the gate--it took me 13 years to get to this point, a documentation specialist for a medical school. Of course, when I was in college (I started in 2005) data science wasn't a thing like it is now--but even library science, which many people think is old-fashioned and only applicable to books would have been useful, since we didn't just STOP using libraries, they just evolved and moved online. But I digress.... \n\nHaving graduated from a very writing-intensive college helps me organize things--ideas and papers--better than my peers but what really makes me salivate is the idea that I'm assisting scientists in their pursuit of truth. You can take the girl out of the liberal arts but not the liberal arts out of the girl!", "Not anymore! It's REALLY difficult. You have to keep up with it or you'll never remember, and I haven't kept up with it. I remember the words more than I remember the cuneiform signs. I've tried to explain it to people sometimes, just how difficult it is, and people just stare at me. It's similar to written Japanese, where there are syllabic signs that can mean several different things, plus logographic signs--most of which tell you what kind of a word the next signs mean. Like there will be a sign letting you know the next signs are a personal name, or a place name, etc. Or is an object made of wood. You don't pronounce those words, but you need to know what they are (and they're usually in Sumerian.)  And that's just the start of it.", "/r/woosh"]}
