I had to give her something that she wanted delivered to my house. As soon as I arrive to her place, she pulls out a list of things for me to do. This is not uncommon, I feel often trapped by her requests to catch up then she springs a to do list for me. Tasks include: booking holidays, translating document, buying things online, sorting out their company issues etc. I am first generation born, my family are immigrants and don\u2019t speak English even though they have been living in this country for over 30 years. \n\nWhen she pulled her list out of asking me to book their family holiday (which I cannot attend because I have no holiday leave left). However the booking was complex and I just lost my shit a little. Of the 7 people going, 3 are boys aged between 21-26 (my 2x cousin and brother) who are also first generation born here. So I ask why can\u2019t one of them do it? Why am I booking a holiday I\u2019m not going on? Why do I always feel like I have to earn my place as her daughter? My brother lives at home, pay next to nothing, have everything provided for him but yet I have to handle admin? Growing up, I never received much attention because I was considered very capable whereas my brother struggled a lot (because he didn\u2019t try) - I won school awards every year but they never attended any. He would be promised gifts if he tried harder, I got nothing for always trying hard. \n\nAfter saying all this, she started to cry and say she knows but it\u2019s what happens to capable people. She can\u2019t trust my brother to book it because he doesn\u2019t care (he booked wrong flights before). If I don\u2019t help her, she\u2019ll have to find another way. My mother is very giving and helps everyone but she makes it my problem. However I feel very bad now afterwards because she is rarely upset.

That she makes you feel bad because you're more capable of handling yourself?\n\nI don't even know what to say to you, it sounds like you grew up in a very toxic environment and helping is just gonna make you feel bad about yourself and not helping will make you feel bad for your mother... Just do whatever feels right, or try talking to her about this in a manner which explains to her that she can't keep expecting you to go out of your way for something as trivial as booking plane tickets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Do you work in their company so they expect you to sort out some paperwork or are THEY just straight up using you for something they're too lazy to do themselves?", ">If I don\u2019t help her, she\u2019ll have to find another way\n\nThen that's what she can do\n\n>My mother is very giving and helps everyone\n\nEveryone but YOU\n\n>Which is why I feel like an asshole\n\nYou feel like an asshole because she WANTS you to.

That\u2019s what I did and she\u2019s learned to respect that. If she springs something non emergency, tell her you can\u2019t do it and make your exit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You came to deliver the item your mother insisted was delivered to your place and not do a long list of chores that she's either not capable of doing or your brothers capable of doing... nor do they want to learn.\n\nThere is nothing stopping your mother from learning to do this stuff herself.  Your brothers learnt a long time ago to act dumb so someone else does it for them.\n\nPerhaps you need to stuff up a few things (esp in regards to your brothers) so that if they don't want to deal with those consequences, they should do it themselves in the first place.\n\nI would be booking a cheap hotel with rooms for your brothers close to the noisest parts of the hotel!\n\nYou may be capable but it doesn't mean that you have to be used up and spat out.\n\nIf your mother is helping everyone by volunteering you or making you do the stuff she said she would... she is actually not a helper.", "NTA.   Really, if she wants you to drop something off, have her come to you for it. You\u2019ll be doing this the rest of your life if you don\u2019t start extraditing yourself now.

Tell your mother this is what travel agents are for, maybe offer to pay the percentage fee, or,  do the work and charge her that fee. 2. Don't translate the document, again there are people that can be paid to do it or, they can pay that rate. your brother is probably bilingual enough to do it also. 3. if you're doing work for the company, if you're not already paid, offer an hourly rate or a larger, 1x consultancy fee. if they say \"familyyyyyy\" say your brother is available to do it for free (if they can guilt him) otherwise \"you just don't have capacity to give free labor 4. prepare for a backlash, but trust me, its worth it. \n\nhaving been the capable daughter with an \"incapable yet somehow with a genuis IQ\" brother, you will be fine once your parents get used to the new boundaries they are perfectly capable of u phold. my mother used to guilt for not calling and preferring texting. I wrote out in a text all my grievances and new boundaries and upheld the. 100%. 2 years later, my mother is perfectly with it. almost like she could've been fine regardless and it was just manipulation.", "NTA, and I know that doesn\u2019t feel good to make your mom cry.

I recommend looking into traits of narcissistic parents. Not sure if it'll be relevant or not, but I figured I'd offer up the information.", "Soft YTA. I say this as a first generation daughter of immigrants with an idiot brother. You blew up at her and dumped years of frustration on her in a moment. That\u2019s terrible. Immigrant parents feel so much guilt having to rely on their children for translation and to navigate customs they don\u2019t know well while facing racism, discrimination, and prejudice while raising their children the best they can. Learning English is NOT easy. I know you feel overwhelmed\u2014 I too have felt this. Tell her to prioritize 2-3 things she needs help with when she sees you. The other things she needs to either wait until next time, or she can learn to do them on her own via Google/YouTube or she can delegate to your brother. This way important things get done and you are not so burdened. Teach her also how to book tickets she can set the language on her computer. Good luck, my friend.", "NTA. Book the holiday. Make it a Motel 6 with a 1-star rating, 4 to a smoking room. RyanAir, economy class. Make absolutely sure your mother knows you are doing this on purpose and the ball is in her court.", "[removed]", "NAH. My mum is like that too. She\u2019s a very giving person, and often offers to help other people by offering my labour. With the same reason that it\u2019s because I\u2019m more capable. It\u2019s a very common thing that happens in the workplace too where the more capable you are, the more work your bosses will give you. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to completely stop helping her, because as an immigrant, cutting off her support can be very bad. but slowly take some steps back. Help with some things on her list, while pushing some of the others to other grown ass people in the family. And try talking about how you need to cut back on what you can help with, and to persuade her to stop offering your help to third parties. \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be a work in progress to wean your mother off relying on you, and I\u2019m not saying that you should completely cut off your help. But slowly stepping back and adjusting the amount of help you give will be healthier in the long run, and avoid bitterness in the future", "NTA NEVER EVER THINK THAT OK!

In fact, stop being capable for that. Her son doesn't care? Stop caring either.", "I wouldn't be so quick to jump to the conclusion that she's guilt tripping her on purpose.
