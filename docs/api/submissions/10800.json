I (27F) and my husband(26M) have been married for a little over 3 years. 2 years ago we began trying to get pregnant. We then moved on to attempting to get pregnant through fertility treatments. When none of this worked we decided we wanted to pursue adoption. All my husbands siblings are adopted and it was something we had been thinking about pursuing even before our fertility issues, but now it seemed like the best route for us to pursue. We did lots of research including attending seminars and contacting multiple different agencies. We ended up deciding on an agency we liked. Since then we have been going through the Home Study process and beginning stages of joining the agency and we recently reached the final stage before we can begin the matching process. \n\nThroughout all this my parents and sisters have been supportive but clearly are unsure how to talk to me about it. I have tried not overwhelm conversations with talking about it but it is a huge part of my life at the moment. I have tried to be especially sensitive to one of my older sisters who is infertile, as I know she has struggled in the past. Well over the last few months I haven\u2019t heard from this sister at all. She is known for being hard to get in contact with, so I tried not to read into it to much, but I was aware she was talking to my parents and our other sister. I finally heard from her yesterday when she called me. \n\nDuring the call she expressed that it is hard to hear about the adoption stuff, which I understand, but then she started telling me that she and my other sister have been frustrated that they were not asked for their opinions before we started the adoption process. She then proceeded to say we always come to just \u201ctell them what we are doing and already have our minds made up\u201d so they feel they can\u2019t share their thoughts on things. She went on to question whether we understand how much harder raising an adopted child is rather than one you give birth to and asking if we aren\u2019t to young to be doing this. I was honestly shocked to hear all this. I have never had the type of relationship with my sisters were I go to them for advice, so hearing that they don\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t part of my decision process made no sense to me. So am I the asshole for not asking their opinion?\n\nExtra context: My sisters husband is adopted and struggles greatly with it.

And, I'm baffled at the viewpoint of how much harder it is raising an adopted child.  Is there really any difference, other than, at some point (earlier the better), the child needs to know they were adopted?", "NTA - We had family drama recently where my wife was berated by her sister for \"not asking her about us moving\" when we moved out of state almost 19 years ago. They felt that they had a right to stop us since it impacted them that we left.\n\nUmm, no, this is a decision that impacts MY FAMILY first and foremost, just like your adoption does.

Why do they think they should have any input on any decision you and your husband make? You said that you never had that type of relationship in the past, so why now. You're adults, capable of making informed, intelligent decisions. Their opinion matters not. \n\nI'm just curious as to why she thinks that raising an adopted child is harder than a biological child. A part from her husband's experience, does she herself have any first hand experience to draw from?

You seem to make decisions similarly to how I do, however I'm older than you. It took me years to recognize that my family felt somewhat distanced by my independence. That was strange to me, since I was highly self-reliant and thought being self-sufficient was supposedly a good thing? But families, apparently, want to feel necessary. I had to start \"asking for a tiny bit of help,\" to allow them in. I hadn't realized how alienated it made them feel. Most humans aren't that independent, so they're confused when someone breaks the mold. Make your decisions. But it may help your family dynamics if you say to them, \"Husband and I are considering this course of action. What do you think of it?\" Then they'll think they helped by offering suggestions, though you still are doing the same things, except with the added bonus of improving your relationships.", "NTA. \n\nThis is a personal decision between you and your partner, no one else.

And given your husband has a history with adoption I\u2019m sure you\u2019re both well aware of what comes with raising an adopted child. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a great thing, truly, and I\u2019m sure your sister knows that, but jealousy is a really difficult emotion to deal with and she might just be processing this news in a way that\u2019s not exactly healthy. Women who struggle with infertility have to deal with so much and sometimes it\u2019s hard to separate that from news of great things like another couple having a child.

You are 27, and that's plenty old enough to make decisions like this. My family is big on adoption, and we have four kids who were adopted into our family.
