I (27F) and my husband(26M) have been married for a little over 3 years. 2 years ago we began trying to get pregnant. We then moved on to attempting to get pregnant through fertility treatments. When none of this worked we decided we wanted to pursue adoption. All my husbands siblings are adopted and it was something we had been thinking about pursuing even before our fertility issues, but now it seemed like the best route for us to pursue. We did lots of research including attending seminars and contacting multiple different agencies. We ended up deciding on an agency we liked. Since then we have been going through the Home Study process and beginning stages of joining the agency and we recently reached the final stage before we can begin the matching process. \n\nThroughout all this my parents and sisters have been supportive but clearly are unsure how to talk to me about it. I have tried not overwhelm conversations with talking about it but it is a huge part of my life at the moment. I have tried to be especially sensitive to one of my older sisters who is infertile, as I know she has struggled in the past. Well over the last few months I haven\u2019t heard from this sister at all. She is known for being hard to get in contact with, so I tried not to read into it to much, but I was aware she was talking to my parents and our other sister. I finally heard from her yesterday when she called me. \n\nDuring the call she expressed that it is hard to hear about the adoption stuff, which I understand, but then she started telling me that she and my other sister have been frustrated that they were not asked for their opinions before we started the adoption process. She then proceeded to say we always come to just \u201ctell them what we are doing and already have our minds made up\u201d so they feel they can\u2019t share their thoughts on things. She went on to question whether we understand how much harder raising an adopted child is rather than one you give birth to and asking if we aren\u2019t to young to be doing this. I was honestly shocked to hear all this. I have never had the type of relationship with my sisters were I go to them for advice, so hearing that they don\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t part of my decision process made no sense to me. So am I the asshole for not asking their opinion?\n\nExtra context: My sisters husband is adopted and struggles greatly with it.

You seem to make decisions similarly to how I do, however I'm older than you. It took me years to recognize that my family felt somewhat distanced by my independence.

I had to start \"asking for a tiny bit of help,\" to allow them in. I hadn't realized how alienated it made them feel. Most humans aren't that independent, so they're confused when someone breaks the mold. Make your decisions.

What do you think of it?\" Then they'll think they helped by offering suggestions, though you still are doing the same things, except with the added bonus of improving your relationships.", "NTA. \n\nThis is a personal decision between you and your partner, no one else.

You are 27, and that's plenty old enough to make decisions like this. My family is big on adoption, and we have four kids who were adopted into our family.

This goes for adoptees **and** adoptive parents.\n\nWhat your post leaves me questioning is: why would \"older\" sister try, given her personal stance on adoption? Per your post, she does plan on adopting. \n\nMy feeling is that \"older\" sister lumped in \"other\" sister when she came to you with this. Probably not because \"other\" sister feels the same, but because \"older\" sister is likely having trouble coming to terms with your life moving faster, and feeling guilty over trying to dissuade you on pursuing this in the immediate term. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think \"older\" sister *doesn't* want you to adopt. I think she is trying to prevent your successful adoption from happening ***first***. This is likely due to her own feelings about where she is in her life vs. where you are in yours. I would hazard a guess that \"older\" sister's husband's (?) trauma around his adoption is, perhaps subconsciously, causing him to drag his feet to avoid confronting the trauma. She is likely feeling both a biological and social clock ticking, and feeling torn between moving at her partner's pace vs. her own pace to meet her expectations for her life.\n\nIt will be very difficult for your relationship with \"older\" sister for you to adopt first; **do not let this dissuade you**. That is a problem she is going to have to work through if she ever hopes for a successful adoption of her own.\n\nI will add one last comment on your \"older\" sister before I offer you something for you and your husband... \n\n**The adoption process is not easy and can fail**. In the same way you have not involved your sister and family in your decision, be aware, the same may be true for her with you. I was the second (and in their words, final) attempt at adoption for my parents. The bio parents of their first baby girl changed their minds after she was born and wanted to keep her; in the state they lived in, that was their right. I say this only because there is **so much** **that needs to go right for you to adopt, and it can still fall through.** Your sister may have already suffered a heartbreak of this kind behind closed doors.

I think it's best you tell them what you're doing rather than ask their opinions.  It's not their life.  They aren't part of this decision, so it makes no sense to ask.  You don't need their opinion.", "NTA.  None of your sisters or their husbands business, except to hopefully be supportive Aunts and Uncles (we hope).", "NTA", "Frankly it is none of their business. Not opinion or unsolicited advice. NTA.", "Adopted child here, I always knew I was adopted and \"chosen\".  Couldn't be happier or more loved.  My two adopted brothers, same situation.  Good luck creating your family!", "Nta aita Challenge try not to ask the most obvious question on earth", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut imagine if she was adopting and you weren't? Would she actually ask for your opinion?", "NTA.  Your family planning is none of their business.  You and your husband are adults, you don't need anyone's \"permission\" to adopt.  How odd they would think they get a say in how you conduct your life.", ">She then proceeded to say we always come to just \u201ctell them what we are doing and already have our minds made up\u201d\n\nThis has nothing to do with them so I really don't see what the issue is. Like you said, you have never had the kind of relationship where you would ask for their opinion.\n\nNTA", "NTA and, well, you wouldn't be the baby sister would you?  I often joke (and social scientists have done the studies) that my sisters see me as the age I was when they left school, starting at age 9.  It took some resolution (with tons of kindness) to get them to see me as a grownup and capable of making my own decisions.  Lots of jokes in that vein now, not least that they finally gave it up when the wrinkles started showing, lol.  I'm so glad for the child/ren you adopt -- lucky little ones for sure.  Wishing you all good things.", "Op why are you tiptoeing around your sisters infertility when you yourself are dealing with fertility issues. Just because she was \u201cfirst\u201d to the discovery doesnt mean that only her feelings matter", "NTA\nWhen my brother and his wife decided to adopt they didn't ask me for my opinion. They announced it to me. Why? Because it's the equivalent of announcing you're pregnant. You made a choice that will impact your life and daily living, not theirs. \n\nDo your sisters have children? Have they held family meetings to garnish everyone's opinions if everyone approved of the pregnancies? Has the eldest held a meeting yet to ask everyone's opinions upon her adopting? What happens if everyone approves adoption for you and not her? *Gasp*\n\nI'm sorry, all intercourse for childbearing should now be opinionated in your family. Please bring this up to the next gathering.", "NTA and Omg your sisters are turds. Good luck on your homestudy. Don\u2019t stress out about cleaning and making everything perfect. They\u2019re just looking for a safe, healthy environment. You don\u2019t have to scrub your baseboards and dust your lightbulbs every time the social workers come over!", "Frankly it's not their life. They shouldn't get a say in anything like this. NTA.", "NTA.  This isn't about them.  It's about you and your husband.  Your opinions are the only ones that matter.  I'm sorry your sister's husband struggles with the fact that he is adopted.  I have friends who are adopted and couldn't care less about it.  As one said, \"I think my mother knew she couldn't give me everything she wanted me to have.  I'm just grateful she was kind enough to give me to someone who could.\"  Best of luck to you and your husband with the adoption process.  Btw, if you're old enough to get pregnant and give birth to a biological child at 27, you're old enough to adopt regardless of your sister's opinion...which never mattered anyway.", "Did the sisters ask for OP\u2019s opinion before having unprotected sex while trying to conceive?\n\nWhat about when ordering their own pizza? Or tying their shoes?\n\nIt absolutely is strange they\u2019d expect OP to want their opinion before making any life choice. \n\nNTA", "Yep. Like, yeah, we *tell* you because we decided what we're doing with *our* family. Weirdo.", "This. Also, OP, do your sisters ask you about all their life choices? Their jobs? Purchasing homes? Who to date or who to marry? Probably not, because it sounds like your sister just has issues with adoption in general. I would text your sister back:\n\n\"BLANK, I am grateful that we had an honest conversation yesterday since I sensed some distance between us. With that said, my husband and I don't intend to ask your opinions on most of our life decisions, just like you didn't ask me for my opinion before X, Y, or Z. We're married adults. Most of our life decisions will be made with our partners, which I feel is normal. And since we are hopefully going to be able to adopt regardless of anyone's opinions, it just makes sense to let you know rather than ask. I'm sorry if this hurts you, and I will try not to discuss our adoption process with you moving forward because I can see we have different views on it. I love you. I hope we can now move forward in our relationship, and I will always wish the best for you.\"", "When the sister said it\u2019s harder to raise an adopted child I thought she was referring to being trauma informed and connecting with a culture outside of yours if it\u2019s a transracial or international adoption.\n\nBut I agree nta they had no reason to believe OP would go to them to ask.", "I agree, and I also wonder if it's the speed with which they've moved. Two years on a fertility journey is not long at all. To have gone through trying to testing for infertility, through fertility treatments to adoption is extremely fast and I wonder if they feel she's just rushing into it without thinking it through. I agree NTA but I must confess it does sit strangely with me. In the UK the recommendation is couples should try for a year before even starting to test for infertility, and then that will take several months. Fertility treatments then take months. Even allowing for a shorter timeline they could only have been considering adoption for a matter of weeks.", "Hello! And thank you. I hope your day is treating you well, too.\n\n\rMy adoption would legally be considered \"closed\". \n\nThere is no relationship between my family of origin and my family, though my parents did meet my maternal family shortly after I was born during the legal proceedings. As a result, I've always had a good concept of that half of my family tree. \n\nI don't have a relationship with either half of my biological family.", "I still don\u2019t see how their opinion matters. \n\nOP\u2019s own sibling in laws were adopted. It\u2019s not like her husband has no experience. And even so, why does sister get to have any opinion other than full support?", "True, tho OP did say they had been considering adoption even before knowing there were any fertility issues so it sounds like it's not even necessarily a \"second choice\" for them.", "I didn't say that it does, but it makes it more understandable to me that the sister would think she should be asked."]}
