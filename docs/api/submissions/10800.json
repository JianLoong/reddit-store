I (27F) and my husband(26M) have been married for a little over 3 years. 2 years ago we began trying to get pregnant. We then moved on to attempting to get pregnant through fertility treatments. When none of this worked we decided we wanted to pursue adoption. All my husbands siblings are adopted and it was something we had been thinking about pursuing even before our fertility issues, but now it seemed like the best route for us to pursue. We did lots of research including attending seminars and contacting multiple different agencies. We ended up deciding on an agency we liked. Since then we have been going through the Home Study process and beginning stages of joining the agency and we recently reached the final stage before we can begin the matching process. \n\nThroughout all this my parents and sisters have been supportive but clearly are unsure how to talk to me about it. I have tried not overwhelm conversations with talking about it but it is a huge part of my life at the moment. I have tried to be especially sensitive to one of my older sisters who is infertile, as I know she has struggled in the past. Well over the last few months I haven\u2019t heard from this sister at all. She is known for being hard to get in contact with, so I tried not to read into it to much, but I was aware she was talking to my parents and our other sister. I finally heard from her yesterday when she called me. \n\nDuring the call she expressed that it is hard to hear about the adoption stuff, which I understand, but then she started telling me that she and my other sister have been frustrated that they were not asked for their opinions before we started the adoption process. She then proceeded to say we always come to just \u201ctell them what we are doing and already have our minds made up\u201d so they feel they can\u2019t share their thoughts on things. She went on to question whether we understand how much harder raising an adopted child is rather than one you give birth to and asking if we aren\u2019t to young to be doing this. I was honestly shocked to hear all this. I have never had the type of relationship with my sisters were I go to them for advice, so hearing that they don\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t part of my decision process made no sense to me. So am I the asshole for not asking their opinion?\n\nExtra context: My sisters husband is adopted and struggles greatly with it.

You're adults, capable of making informed, intelligent decisions. Their opinion matters not. \n\nI'm just curious as to why she thinks that raising an adopted child is harder than a biological child.

You seem to make decisions similarly to how I do, however I'm older than you. It took me years to recognize that my family felt somewhat distanced by my independence.

I had to start \"asking for a tiny bit of help,\" to allow them in. I hadn't realized how alienated it made them feel. Most humans aren't that independent, so they're confused when someone breaks the mold. Make your decisions.

What do you think of it?\" Then they'll think they helped by offering suggestions, though you still are doing the same things, except with the added bonus of improving your relationships.", "NTA. \n\nThis is a personal decision between you and your partner, no one else.

You are 27, and that's plenty old enough to make decisions like this. My family is big on adoption, and we have four kids who were adopted into our family.

This goes for adoptees **and** adoptive parents.\n\nWhat your post leaves me questioning is: why would \"older\" sister try, given her personal stance on adoption? Per your post, she does plan on adopting. \n\nMy feeling is that \"older\" sister lumped in \"other\" sister when she came to you with this. Probably not because \"other\" sister feels the same, but because \"older\" sister is likely having trouble coming to terms with your life moving faster, and feeling guilty over trying to dissuade you on pursuing this in the immediate term. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think \"older\" sister *doesn't* want you to adopt. I think she is trying to prevent your successful adoption from happening ***first***. This is likely due to her own feelings about where she is in her life vs. where you are in yours. I would hazard a guess that \"older\" sister's husband's (?) trauma around his adoption is, perhaps subconsciously, causing him to drag his feet to avoid confronting the trauma. She is likely feeling both a biological and social clock ticking, and feeling torn between moving at her partner's pace vs. her own pace to meet her expectations for her life.\n\nIt will be very difficult for your relationship with \"older\" sister for you to adopt first; **do not let this dissuade you**. That is a problem she is going to have to work through if she ever hopes for a successful adoption of her own.\n\nI will add one last comment on your \"older\" sister before I offer you something for you and your husband... \n\n**The adoption process is not easy and can fail**. In the same way you have not involved your sister and family in your decision, be aware, the same may be true for her with you. I was the second (and in their words, final) attempt at adoption for my parents. The bio parents of their first baby girl changed their minds after she was born and wanted to keep her; in the state they lived in, that was their right. I say this only because there is **so much** **that needs to go right for you to adopt, and it can still fall through.** Your sister may have already suffered a heartbreak of this kind behind closed doors. She may know something you don't about how much farther the goal post is for her and her husband.\n\n***Be kind, stay strong.***\n\nFor you and  your husband: My parents never let me go a day not knowing I was adopted. It was not intended to **be** othering, it was intended to **stop** those feelings. \n\n>***As an adoptee, my journey to my mom and dad was different -- that does not make*** ***me*** ***different.*** \n\nThat is all your child needs to know, in a way that is age appropriate for them.\n\nAs an anecdote, in spite of these teachings, I still came home from pre-school one day crying because a classmate had overheard his parents regarding my adoption, misunderstood, and called me an alien. This is to say that my advice isn't fool proof, but may it get you 80% of the way there. \n\nMuch love to you and your husband -- may you be blessed with the opportunity to change a child's life.", "NTA. you\u2019re an adult. you don\u2019t need their permission to do anything", "NTA. I\u2019m a biological child to my parents, who are great parents but there are still struggles to our relationship and baggage I have because of ways I was raised. Being biologically related is not some easy parenting hack. Adoption is a beautiful thing. You go girl", "NTA. This is a decision for you and your spouse, no one else.", "Nope. NTA. None of her business.", "NTA If you run your ideas of what you want to do past your family you will have a marriage run by committee. It would be like saying, 'oh we are thing of going to Europe just the two of us,' then they will say, 'oh don't go to Europe it will be cold right now, go to Hawaii instead, in fact don't go on your own, lets make it a family trip and oh, forget going in January, we will all go in June.' Your life will never be your own, you will be puppets. Marriage is hard enough being united together and being on the same page without your whole family telling you what to do as if your a teenagers again. It is far better to say, 'we have decided to go to Europe in January, just the two of us.' It is always better to present decisions done and dusted and keep family on the down low. You and you partner must be very clear and united on adoption and parenting without family sticking their oars into it.", "Something about you doing this causes them to question their own decisions. They wanted you to ask fir their opinions in order to convince you to accept their point of view.  You didn\u2019t do so and now that you are actually going through the steps to adopt. They are losing their chance to convince you not to.  \n\nStrange.  Wonder what it is that scares them about you going forward.  Any chance this is about you bringing the first grandchild into the family?", "NTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t her decision if you adopt.  It is your decision with your husband.  Your sister gets no say on the matter.", "Aggg, your sister needs to get over herself, like for real. Hoe many children out there are adopted and happy for it. Your heart is big and amazing and don't allow those 2 sisters to put you off adoption. How dare she use her husband's feelings to influence your life. \n\nDon't speak to her anymore about this. She sounds annoying and exhausting", "NTA. You and your partner are under no obligation to consult your siblings on your family planning decisions. Their feelings about it are their own to deal with, and not your responsibility.", "NTA in the slightest. You are under NO obligation to discuss your decisions within your marriage with anybody who doesn't have a daily role in that decision, especially given it's not the dynamic to ask them for advice. You and your husband are grown adults and do not need approval from anybody else. \n\nI'm not adopted and I've never gone through this, but I'd imagine it's not the exact same as it was 20+ years ago (however old the adopted husband is), and not every experience is a bad one. We have more studies done on adopted children and based on what you have said, there's a lengthy process before you even get matched. That being said, you don't have to be an expert to adopt a child. I'd imagine so much preparatory information is given to you throughout this process, so while not an expert, you know the hardships you may face. I'm fairly confident you are doing what is best for you and they do not need to have a say in any of this.", "I see a lot of responses that take the sister's statement of \"she and my other sister have been frustrated that they were not asked for their opinions before we started the adoption process. She then proceeded to say we always come to just \u201ctell them what we are doing and already have our minds made up\u201d so they feel they can\u2019t share their thoughts on things.\" at face value.\n\nPersonally, I presume the one sister is projecting her feelings on the rest of the family. It sounds like you, OP, are surprised your family feels this way. So ... maybe, ask them when older sister isn't around. Politely, with space to be wrong \"I may be wrong, but are you feeling left out? Did you have advice or input that you wanted to give us? I've got a habit of being very independent, I know, but I do value you and your insight, so ...\" and then maybe you'll hear that they did feel left out and you can address that. Or more likely, you'll hear they feel fine and respect you and you'll know it's your sister projecting.\n\nMy mom used to do this all the time \"Your grandma and I are so angry with you about ...\" and I'd tearfully go to grandma and apologize and she'd be clueless as to what I was talking about. She'd tell me people at her work all disliked me for interrupting all the time, so I'd stop going over only to be asked by said co-workers where I was cuz they missed me. I have enough examples in my life ... whenever someone tells me that 'I, and this other person who isn't here at the moment, feel this way...\" I automatically delete the entire 'and this other person who isn't here at the moment'\" from the sentence/sentiment.\n\nNTA in case it is needed.", "NTA. Your life, your decisions. This isn't the kind of thing you let others decide for you even if you tend to ask them for advice. Clearly she feels the need to stop you, so she's TA and you need to ignore her.", "NTA. WTF. She both thinks you need her blessing to do this, and that you and your husband - who grew up in a household with adopted children - don't understand the implications of adoption? Your sister is way out of line.", "NTA, and I bet your sister would also get offended if you offered your opinion on how she should adress her infertility, or if she should adopt or not.", "Why do your sisters and Mom need to be a part of this process? I don\u2019t mean to cast them aside entirely, but why would their opinions even matter here? NTA. I think it\u2019s really awesome that you and your husband have studied up so much on adoption and seem prepared to give a child a wonderful new home and family!", "NTA\nIf this isn't the type of thing you would normally discuss with them then there was no need for you to be involve them. Sounds like there's some bitterness from your sister, maybe her husband is opposed to adoption for them and she's jealous. This is a very difficult issue.", "NAH\n\nShe's asking to be more involved and outlining the type of relationship she'd like with you. Try it out and see if you like this sort of relationship with her or not.\n\nThe other commenters are getting twisted up because adoption is involved, but your sister is basically hurt because she's like to be closer and has been a big girl and told you that.", "NTA. Even if you did have the type of relationship where you seek advice from your sisters, the decision to adopt is yours (meaning you & husband) and yours alone. \n\nI hope all goes well for you in the adoption process--good luck!", "Who does your sister think she is? Why in the world should expect to weigh in on this decision, especially if you don\u2019t have this kind of relationship. Sounds like all she cares about is her feelings and thoughts and doesn\u2019t give a shit about you and your life. It\u2019s all about her. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nAdoption can only be yours & your husbands decision. Just as it would be if you also decided not to proceed further or to keep trying.\n\nAlways do what you feel is right. It's your life & for your sisters to think that they should have an opinion in such a major decision in your life is absolutely insane.", "NTA, sounds like she is struggling with her own infertility journey. I would worry about what she may say to any child you adopt. \n\nAs an adoptee with a brother and sister also adopted. I can safely say that there are no guarantees if a child will be \"difficult\" whether they are adopted or biological.\n\nMy brother and I were pretty easy going, my sister not so much but on the other hand my Aunts and Uncles who  had kids some were easy and some  kids that were difficult.", "NTA. Why should you ask their opinion for your life decisions? How is it any of their business? It\u2019s your life. And if your husband\u2019s siblings are all adopted and you\u2019ve done research I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re as prepared as you can be. And obviously you\u2019re having trouble conceiving so why is she even mentioning biological children? She\u2019s being mean and insane. She can\u2019t possibly believe you should run your life and decisions by her.", "This is not about the adoption. This is about their belief that they should have a say in OP's life. My Dad's family is like that even after my dad left their house and made his life for 40+ years exactly as he pleased. Completely delusional. \n100% NTA", " I would just ignore her, OP. Her comments are probably more about her than you.", "As adoptive parents, my husband and I were always 100% honest with our kids. The adoptions were never considered a big deal - more like part of our family story. My kids have had the opportunity to know their birthparents, which has made everyone's lives better.", "Of the 8 families I personally know who have gone through adoption, not a single one didn't wind up going through a nightmare fuel hellscape. Adopted as a baby, after fostering, from a relative, it didn't matter.", "Yeah, imagine every couple trying for a kid needs to get input / permission of the family to do so. (Like when, how \ud83d\ude09). So why reacting different to adoption? They want a family. Their decision. I understand to ask questions about the process of adoption or maybe pointing out certain things that may arise (like Do they want contact to the birth parents? Is it a international adoption? ...). but it's definitely a decision of the future parents.", "Would you give the same advice if they were a couple trying to conceive naturally? Yeah, like when, which position... Nope. Growing a family is a decision of the couple, not extended family. It's not like buying a car or house where getting lots of input makes sense.", "There are actually already a few grandchildren in the family from my oldest sibling. Interesting thought though", "u/BloodInforraju is a bot. Original comment posted [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11askbj/_/j9trd7i/?context=1) by u/ikabikaboo .", "OP, the decision to adopt is extremely personal, and it sounds like you and your partner are doing a great job of educating yourselves. Your sister is coming from a place of pain and loss, but undertaking parenthood is a journey for all of us.\n\nAs an adoptive parent, I would not agree with your sister that raising an adoptive child is harder than raising a biological one. You will encounter difficulties at some point with any child, adopted or biological. It does sound like your BIL had a difficult time, but that doesn't mean that every adopted child has a similar experience.\n\nI have found that openness and honesty is extremely important. My children have met and developed relationships with their birth parents to varying degrees. There are no secrets about my children's origins, yet it's not something that we make a big deal about either.\n\nIt's natural that your sisters want to weigh in on the adoption process, but ultimately this is a decision that should be made between you and your spouse. (Adoption does tend to be something that everyone has an opinion on for some reason.)\n\nNTA, and good luck to you and your future family."]}
