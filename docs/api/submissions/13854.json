You are right to challenge her toxic and sexist attitudes and hypocrisy.  What is worse is that males who are victims of abuse cannot get help due to these attitudes, and people considering suicide who might just need a bit of support can end up dying unnecessarily too.\n\nIt is wrong and completely indefensible.  This attitude also does nothing to help women.  It is just self righteously vile, toxic, cruel and vindictive behavior.", "There's a difference between preferences and mocking someone because they arent \"manly enough\"", "I suggest you read up a bit on feminism. Third wave feminism has some problematic elements but that doesn't make the whole movement a societal issue. Not when women in too many parts of the world still don't have legal personhood, can't get a job or drive or vote or leave the house without a male relative, and get murdered for bringing shame on their families when they get raped.\n\nNot when women get paid less to do the same work as men, when women's health issues are inadequately researched (with a few exceptions) and their pain is routinely not taken seriously, when one woman a week gets murdered by a current or former intimate partner, when women continue to be shamed for things men can do with impunity.\n\nNot when school girls are secretly 'graded' on websites by boys and their home addresses shared, when girls are reporting increasing rates of sex-related injuries because boys are pressuring them into extreme sex acts they discovered watching porn, when boys secretly make sex tapes with girls and share them with their peers. I could go on.\n\nI recommend starting with Mary Wollstonecraft's 'Vindication of the Rights of Woman.' Still excellent (and depressingly relevant) reading more than 200 years since it was first published.", "You want to dilute the blame on her and women like her and shift the blame for her hatred of men to men.  That is a bit sick.\n\nNot sure why you think that is a good thing to do, but your thinking is contorted and poor.", "You sound...ignorant. I'm a 24(F) and it took me getting into adulthood to realize I truly did have a case of internalized misogyny. It was honestly the cringiest thing I've ever gone through. I was obsessed with being seen as, \"one of the boys\" and even more obsessed with being \"not like other girls\". I viewed myself and other woman as weak simply because of our gender. Which is wrong. I had myself convinced I need to be as masculine as possible. Sometimes I even hated the fact that I was a woman, because I wanted to be strong enough to fight for myself in any situation. \n\nWhat I realized is though, is due to my past experiences dealing with abuse all throughout childhood from my father and later on ex boyfriend played a massive role in this. Another contributing factor is I wasn't entirely comfortable identifying fully as a woman. Recently came out to a few people in my personal life as non-binary, and honestly once I realized another issue for me was that I couldn't fully identify with either gender, it was a lot easier for me to release all those negative beliefs I held. \n\nDidn't mean to seemingly pointless ramble on for no reason. My point is you genuinely sound like you don't know what you're talking about. Either that or you don't fully understand what you're even saying yourself. Even I had a hard time trying to make sense of it.", "So, misogyny is rooted in the system of patriarchy, which is a societal structure that treats men/masculinity as of more value than women/femininity. Misogyny is anti- woman, but it's also anti-feminine. It's why \"not like other girls\" is a thing, because it's the belief that being not like a woman is better. Yes, it's complicated when it's also about not actually being that gender (I am also nonbinary), but the basic belief system of misogyny is \"masculine=good, feminine=bad\".\n\nWhat this person is doing is mocking men who she perceives as having \"feminine\" traits, therefore saying the feminine traits are the bad thing. Which is misogyny. Since she is a woman, it's internalized misogyny. She's mocking men for being human, which is unacceptable of her, she's shitting on men for having emotional intelligence, which is unhealthy of her, and she's rejecting them for doing things she's decided are feminine, which is hypocritical of her.\n\nI hope that explanation is clearer. I was trying to not include a wall of text and say it concisely, but sounds like I tried to be too concise. This is all on her and her choices to be an asshole to and about these men, my comment was about trying to clarify the terminology about what flavor of asshole she's being."]}
