My partner of 22 years hasn\u2019t had lobster/crab/ prawn in over 21 years. She only had to see my reaction once. Anaphylaxis is deadly.", "Exactly this!! I love seafood. Love it. My husband is allergic. Guess what we haven\u2019t had in our house the last 23 years we have been together??? \nHe took me to a sushi restaurant once twenty years ago for my birthday as a surprise. He had beef teriyaki that was supposed to have been cooked in a different kitchen. He thought it would be safe. We spent the night in the ER. I said never again! I love my husband more than some damn sushi roll. \nI don\u2019t care how much OP\u2019s family likes lobster. Not worth their life. \nDamn people.", "This alone is a solid argument!", "That risks their kitchen being contaminated, I think the husband and inlaws need to book an AirBnB or hotel with a kitchen and cook there, not put the person with the severe allergy out, only to expose them to allergens in their own home.", "This is a bad take because 1) what if parents are from Maine or something and the lobster is freshly caught? That\u2019s something that would absolutely not be available at a local restaurant. \n\nAnd more importantly 2) because there are a lot of times when people prefer their own version of a food to restaurant versions, and when you know you can cook something better, it does not hit the spot. Like there are a lot of foods I just can\u2019t eat at restaurants anymore because I\u2019m just generally disappointed.\n\nIt seems like for years, the house has been accommodating her needs of keeping lobster out. But now the one time he wants to accommodate his need for a special occasion, she\u2019s like \u201cno actually.\u201d", "That\u2019s so not the same. 1) you have no way of knowing where the parents are from or how fresh the lobster is. If it is freshly caught, that\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t be able to get at a local restaurant. \n\n2) there are times when people prefer their own food to restaurant food. Food isn\u2019t all replaceable. If you know you can cook something better than a restaurant can, you\u2019ll never be satisfied eating it at a restaurant. \n\nIf someone brought over expensive dry aged steaks and I wanted to cook them myself, and someone told me to \u201cjust go to a restaurant\u201d I feel like it would be clear how those would be two completely different experiences. I don\u2019t see how lobster is any different.", "It's already at \"difficulty breathing\" stage, so very serious. This situation is insanity to me.", "Not the OP but she said difficulty breathing as one of the reactions so I'd say yes.", "The storage and the cooking is also a problem, because even a small amount of cross-contamination with her food could be dangerous.", "I'm so surprised by all the N T A comments... like her being nauseous from the smell has nothing to do with an allergy. \n\nI have friends who are hella allergic to crustaceans but love the smell of a seafood tagliatelle or gambas al ajillo cooking. \n\nThey don't break out in anaphylaxis from someone cooking that shit in the same room. Unless they are leaning their head over the stove/pan and breathing deep- you are 100% correct and it's no different than a table next to you ordering something you can't eat. What a snowflake. YTA", "You don\u2019t consume the things someone is allergic to in their home. It is not her responsibility to leave to make everyone else happy. If they want lobster so bad that they just *have to have it,* then they can go out and get it. Not isolate OP in her own home and force her into discomfort or demand she leave. That\u2019s so unbelievably rude I\u2019d be mortified to even consider it as an option. \u201cGet out of your house so we can eat what we want in it.\u201d Who does that?\n\nHe asked someone with an allergy for an exception - allergies do not make exceptions. She said no - no is a complete sentence. End of discussion. Adults can solve this problem without involving an isolation room and top to bottom scrubbing. Go out to eat if having lobster with the parents is so important to the husband.", "If he wants to eat lobster he can do so outside the house, why must the person with an allergy accommodate the other?", "I\u2019m an MD specializing in anesthesia. Why is this relevant? We specialize in placing breathing tubes - especially in patients with difficult airways (like those swelling shut because of anaphylaxis), we manage/treat anaphylaxis in the OR if patients react unexpectedly to an anesthetic or other medications mid-surgery. Finally, anesthesiologists also work in ICUs where we treat patients with extreme allergic reactions.\n\nSo in my opinion: Absolutely not. This is not an \u201cair it out and it\u2019ll be ok\u201d situation. First: IgE mediated reactions can be fine - or at least survivable- until they\u2019re not. For things like peanuts, people can go from \u201cfeel raspy after eating a peanut\u201d to \u201cfull medical emergency after just touching a peanut\u201d between one episode and the next. Just like a body makes antibodies to a vaccine, the body stores extra antibodies to attack an autoimmune antigen after every exposure. Each exposure risks a stronger response, so the next one could be deadly. This is bolstered by the fact that her body already gets to \u201cthroat closing and nausea\u201d- there\u2019s not much space between there and absolute collapse of breathing and circulatory systems.  That kills in minutes, if not seconds. OP didn\u2019t say, but I\u2019d guess (or really hope) they carry an epi pen.\n\nDeath may not be the most likely outcome in this scenario, but it is absolutely possible, it wouldn\u2019t be *surprising*, and what kind of asshole gambles on those outcomes for their wife?????\n\nSecond, she expects to return to HER OWN HOME afterwards that will now be a minefield of potential exposure, despite the existence of very reasonable alternatives for her husband. If she is even more sensitive to it this time (which, again, is expected to some degree depending on time since last exposure), or if husband hasn\u2019t cleaned well enough, there is nowhere else for her to sleep. Allergic reaction intensifies based on dose- so if her husband hasn\u2019t cleaned to the extent needed for her allergies, and she feels fine initially but then falls asleep for 8 hours, the likelihood of sh*t hitting the fan is pretty high. Also- why should she lose her \u201csafe\u201d place to accommodate her husband\u2019s occasional desire?\n\nFinally, anaphylactic shock comes in two stages. After the first immediate reaction while you are still in direct presence of the antigen, there is a second mast-cell and histamine mediated response that can happen up to 8 hours later and set off a whole second cascade of badness. If your response is serious enough, it has bought you at least a day in a hospital TO MAKE SURE YOUR AIRWAY DOESN\u2019T CLOSE. Because no one wants to send you home and say \u201coops\u201d when they realize you can\u2019t breathe\u2026again. WHY is someone voluntarily putting OP in this situation.\n\nOP- 1000% NTA. This is completely preventable and puts you in the path of a lot of potential harm. I feel really angry that people who don\u2019t live with allergies, and/or people without any medical understanding of how they work, are trying to tell you it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nI\u2019m not here to tell you how to deal with your husband but I am here to validate your very very justified anger.\n\nETA: just want to add that the dose needed to trigger this reaction is whatever particles are small enough to float in the air for several feet. Meaning if any singular dose of that amount stays in the apartment after cooking, even if husband clears 99%, it could still be enough to trigger a reaction. No one cleans well enough to get 100% of problematic airborne triggers out unless they have specially designed circuits to guarantee (and UV clean/HEPA filter) massive amounts of clean air turnover. Again. WHY.", "\"Hey honey, don't worry about not being able to breathe - I'll minimise the risk!\" is not all that comforting really. Would you really gamble your life on your husband's ability to know everywhere his parents put lobster-contaminated hands?", "Strongly agree with this and really don\u2019t understand the people saying that the husband is putting his love for lobster above his love for OP when this is a one off. Just doesn\u2019t seem fair to the husband when he goes out of his way all the time to make sure that OP is okay. Given that there is essentially no risk, I don\u2019t see why OP can\u2019t compromise or what the big deal is. There are meds for nausea if that is the worse that would happen since the husband sounds like he would make sure that everything is extra clean. Although he could probably spray some Febreeze or Lysol or light a candle to get rid of the smell. Or even have the windows open as he cooks.

And that's only because the nausea is probably partly a psychological response to the smell of something that makes her ill, not in itself part of her allergic reaction.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, he misses some contamination because he doesn't see every single place his parents rest the lobster before he takes charge of it. Or he doesn't notice some a stray drop of water hitting another food item in the fridge. And at that point I feel the need to remind you that OP said she gets both hives and serious respiratory symptoms when exposed to her allergen. \n\nShe hasn't gone into full-blown anaphylaxis **yet**, but \"difficulty breathing\" is well on the way to it and can worsen to become a life-threatening anaphylactic attack at any point.\n\nYou are literally expecting OP to gamble her life on her husband's cleaning skills.", "Yes there are many ways for the husband to enjoy his meal with his parents without causing OP any discomfort or danger. One is going to his friend's house as OP suggested. Other can be going out to a  restaurant to eat instead of the in-laws bringing their own.

It's not that the in-laws can only eat lobster or that they can only eat it at OP and her husband's home and not somewhere outside. OP is asking them not to eat at home, she isn't asking them not to eat it anywhere.\n\nAlso, another thought, are the in-laws bringing raw lobster to cook and eat? If so, the kitchen will get contaminated, the utensils and anything they touch. It will not be limited to just the living room. If they are bringing a cooked one, won't it need to be reheated or something? (4 hours is a long distance and also, I know nothing about how one eats a lobster). Even if no reheating is required, they will need utensils to eat, a place to wash them, a place to wash themselves...spreading it from the kitchen to the bathroom. And I don't think the husband will do such a great job of cleaning all the places thoroughly with his mother there who has the opinion that the allergy is nothing serious.  \n\n\nAnd most importantly, It's OP's home too.

To call it \u201cessentially no risk\u201d is straight up wrong and dangerous. I\u2019m responding to clarify why.\n\nOP is already so allergic that even smelling it causes her body to start shutting down. Meaning: the dose of the allergen required to give her life-threatening symptoms is small enough that it can float on air across at least a few feet. Nausea and throat swelling are very bad signs of organ dysfunction. It\u2019s not that people can\u2019t breathe through a swollen throat, it\u2019s that no one knows when the swelling will stop and, eventually, it will make it completely impossible to breathe. I\u2019ve explained above how each exposure to an allergen can create a worse reaction the next time, so surviving previous encounters doesn\u2019t guarantee this one will be ok. \n\nHow long can you hold your breath? 1 minute? 2? Probably not 3. If her throat closes, that\u2019s how long OP would have to get medical attention before suffering potentially permanent organ and brain damage. \n\nUnless you can guarantee you know when the swelling will stop and that OP will be able to breathe enough oxygen for her brain and organs to survive at that level, you cannot say it\u2019s \u201cminimal risk\u201d.  \n\n\u201cNausea medicine\u201d doesn\u2019t address the root cause, because the cause is the body shutting down from the beginning stages of anaphylactic shock. Its like saying you can put a bandaid on a stab wound. Same with Lysol: it might not *smell* like lobster, but the lobster particles are still there. Her body isn\u2019t reacting to the smell, it\u2019s that the smell co-exists with the thing that gives her life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\nAgain, she\u2019s already exhibiting signs that are really concerning and tell me she needs to stay WELL away from lobster and carry an epi pen.", "Okay but the whole point is that if he wants to eat home cooked lobster, she\u2019s telling him he can\u2019t. \n\nUnless he intends to buy a second home just to cook himself some lobster or a fucking camp stove to do it in the backyard, she\u2019s essentially telling him \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to eat home cooked lobster\u201d.

I don\u2019t know about you, but when I have a food craving, it will last for months, it doesn\u2019t just go away. \n\nIt would suck to know I want to eat something and be craving it for months and know I could fix it. It feels like he\u2019s accommodated her allergies for years, and he\u2019s asking for ONE accommodation for a special occasion and promising to be safe. But she obviously doesn\u2019t trust him enough or care enough about him to accommodate him the way he has been doing for her.", "The patio table doesn\u2019t address the problem of cooking the lobster, which would have to happen in the kitchen either way. And it seems like that would be more of an issue than actually just eating it.", "Can't read can you? There's this magical place outside of Reddit. It's called \"outside\". It has a vast amount of air so people can have cook outs in the same area as people with allergies. \n\nMaybe go check it out sometime, it'd be good for you.", "But the wife isn't saying don't cook for your parents. The wife is saying don't cook or eat lobster at her house. \n\nIf my parents are coming from out of town and my partner asks not to eat something at home he is allergic to (not that he will have to ask because we will all already know), I won't and neither will my parents. Normal people know that allergies are not a joke. We can cook anything else, the world will not come to a stop or we will not die if we don't that one particular thing. \nIf it is so important to eat lobster they can find another way and place to eat it except the house. \nAlso, I think since the in-laws already know but are of the opinion that it is nothing serious, they are bringing it just to show OP that nothing wil happen to her except for a \"rash\".", "So that\u2019s why she goes to restaurants that serve seafood?? If it would kill her then how is it that she manages to go to these places without issue?", "I didn\u2019t say they would disappear lol. I said it would help minimize the smell. You know, the same smell that occurs in the restaurants she goes to that also serve seafood?", "in what way?? she literally says right in the post that \"he is usually really good about my allergy and always check in restaurants before going there if they sell seafood and will warn the waiters about my allergy. this is completely out of character for him.\" she also says he typically eats it hours away from her and never near her. how on earth does that imply he does this all the time?", "Yeah, but this proves that cross contamination of the kitchen and pots and pans isn\u2019t a problem. \n\nSo if she leaves the house for a few hours, and husband thoroughly cleans, she wouldn\u2019t have an issue here either.", "I don\u2019t eat it. It\u2019s just self-control. \n\nBut if I absolutely *had* to have it\u2026 I\u2019d go somewhere like a friend or relative\u2019s house to make it. \n\nYou\u2019re making her allergy out to be an inconvenience that must be worked around. Like the husband is doing her a favor \u201caccommodating her.\u201d That\u2019s not the right perspective. When you marry someone you accept them wholly. He accepted her food allergy when they got married. He chose to make that a part of his life. He can\u2019t start acting like he did her a favor and now she owes him after all of this \u201caccommodation.\u201d No. That\u2019s selfish and sounds like a childish tantrum.\n\nIt\u2019s not about trusting him, that\u2019s a nasty little twist to be honest. That\u2019s very close to gaslighting if not outright abusive behavior. It\u2019s also a horrible logical fallacy (Straw Man). So we\u2019re just going to pass over that.", "I have significant health issues & never once has a family member said \u201cI know I usually accommodate you but just this once you should be ok not breathing so I can be happy\u201d so I dunno maybe I\u2019m just not the person who\u2019s going to have a good contribution to this nonsense", "I\u2019m sorry the idea of disabled people breathing is so angering to you.", "I was refuting what you said. \n\nYou said, and I quote: \u201cOP is asking them not to eat at home, she isn't asking them not to eat it anywhere.\u201d \n\nBut if OP wants homecooked lobster, there\u2019s nowhere for him to eat it but at his own home. Or he can wait until the next time he drives to visit his parents I guess. But she\u2019s definitely telling him he can\u2019t eat lobster. Because if he can\u2019t cook it at home, he can\u2019t even take it to the park or eat in anywhere in town really.", "(I'm making fun of the first comment I replied to for telling OP to divorce him over a single lobster)", "It is absolutely about trust. She doesn\u2019t trust his ability to clean the kitchen after cooking the lobster. If she did, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Because I assume she\u2019s visited her in laws (who presumably have cooked lobster in their own home based upon this post) and the contamination in their house and on their pots and pans clearly didn\u2019t cause an issue. \n\nSo that tells me that her husbands plan of isolating her and cleaning throughly is actually a pretty reasonable one, she just doesn\u2019t trust his judgement. You can refuse to address it, but I promise I\u2019m not gaslighting. I genuinely think this is a trust thing.", "I mean, he\u2019s not asking her to be there for it or eat it. She can leave the house for a few hours or whatever, I don\u2019t see why this is such a big issue. But whatever, since clearly you\u2019re the only person on earth who has medical issues and I guess that gives you the right to dictate how all your loved ones live their lives.\n\nAnyway, I would assume she has eaten at her in laws before, or visited with her husband. She said he eats lobster there, which implies they\u2019ve cooked with lobster in their house and the contamination wasn\u2019t a problem at all for her, otherwise she would have had issues from the same pots and pans or whatever. Which tells me that if he actually cooks and cleans the way he says he will, it absolutely won\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe real issue here is that the wife doesn\u2019t trust her husband.", "I'm sorry you don't have the brain power to fully realize what you can do with a backyard and fresh air. \nAgain maybe go take a hike? Get out of your mothers basement floor bud", "He wants to cook it to eat then that's his problem. If he just wants to eat he can go to a restaurant. OP did not say no to that. If the husband is dying for homecooked lobster, he can go drive for 4 hours and eat it at his parents home or take it to a friend's house (OP suggested taking it to the friend's house that means the friend also loves lobster and/or they have done something similar in the past) and take extra lobster for the friend's family. HE SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT EAT LOBSTER at his house when his wife is allergic and does not want lobster in the house and OP should put her foot down on this. \n\nHis want to eat homecooked lobster does not trump her seafood allergy. \n\nIf I am allergic to something I don't care how who my partner is meeting or after how long, I won't allow him to cook that thing in our house and same will go the other way.

Period.", "Bro I don\u2019t know what friends you have who let you just show up and cook things in their houses. \n\nWorst case scenario, the friend ends up cooking it. Best case scenario, you\u2019re cooking in a foreign kitchen that may not have all the tools you need. \n\nAlso now you have to deal with the weird vibes between your parents and friends. Can people stop suggesting that like it\u2019s a perfectly normal/reasonable option?", "I guess maybe I\u2019m an asshole then, cause I personally think if you\u2019re married to someone for 10-15 years, and you\u2019ve abstained from cooking the one thing they\u2019re allergic with, and just this ONE time you have a craving for some kind of food, it should be okay for you to be able to cook it just that once. \n\nAnd as to being kicked out of your own house - you\u2019re really telling me you\u2019ve never left the house for a few hours while she has her girlfriends over for brunch or chosen to hang out in the bedroom and make yourself scarce while they were watching movies in the living room? It\u2019s pretty normal for one spouse to use the house in a way that the other spouse is either out of the house or relegated to one area of the house for a few hours. It\u2019s not \u201ckicking them out.\u201d \n\nLet me know how you find that different than this. Because if anything, I think the fact that the lobster is a one time thing, whereas the situation I describe tends to be more common, the lobster thing is better.", "OP suggesting the friend's house means that it might be normal for them. It is not for everybody but it is for some. Really close friends whose families know each other. My cousin has 2 friends like that.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, just arguing from a very selfish and juvenile perspective, that\u2019s all. \n\nHe needs to be in control of his emotions and desires. There are a lot of things in life we really really want but must refuse for good reasons. \n\nMy wife\u2019s friends coming over to hang out does not make me uncontrollably physically ill or uncomfortable, it\u2019s a false equivalence to an actual physical allergy. And no, leaving the house so the other spouse can use the house is not \u201cnormal.\u201d That\u2019s toxic. Be big kids and share the space. If you can\u2019t live together without cramping each other\u2019s style maybe marriage isn\u2019t the best idea."]}
