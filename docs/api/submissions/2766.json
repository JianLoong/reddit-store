She wants to do this marine animal conservation which I support 100%. She knows the risks of taking it on (seeing some die, letting most of them go without imprinting/emotional connections), and I am honestly proud of her wanting to do this.\n\nThe issue that came up has been going on every now and then for the last 2-2.5 years. She has a very impulsive personality and I don\u2019t think she understands the real weight, mindset, and power of these big animals. For example, she went camping last year and a bear came up to their other trailer about 20 ft away. Her family literally had to hold her back because she wanted to go up and try to pet/cuddle the bear so bad. \n\nShe brought up about 2 years ago that she wanted to get a puma as a pet, which is an animal she\u2019s been obsessed with for a while and still is to this day. I brushed it under the rug, but after the first couple talks/excitement rants about it, I finally told her my thoughts. I said that I don\u2019t think she really understands the actual risks and responsibilities of taking care of a wild animal as a pet, a puma no less. \n\nShe got upset with me because I \u201cunderestimated\u201d her and she didn\u2019t talk about it for about 6 months. Then, she brought up getting a wolf-dog. Not as much of a wild animal, but still a huge, not-fully-domesticated dog. I said that that was easier and more realistic, but she has to know the price to pay with those things and that they aren\u2019t like your typical husky. She said she knows and she would do that. After that, she brought up the puma again a month later. She went on about wanting to buy one and I just didn\u2019t say anything bad about it cuz it was sort of late and I didn\u2019t want to argue. \n\nNow today, she\u2019s getting a new cat. It\u2019s a bengal. That isn\u2019t too bad, a lot of people have bengals and you don\u2019t need any big license for it. Then afterwards, she kept going on about bengals and then said \u201cMy next pet I want to get is a Savannah cat, which is a step down from a Bob cat.\u201d I said she was being impulsive and I didn\u2019t think she actually did the math on these things, bringing up the bear incident in the process as a big red flag for me. She said I was underestimating her and tanking her mood, and now I feel bad.\n\nShould I just back down and let her bite off more than she can chew with buying these, in my opinion, expensive and overrated wild animals as PETS through impulse? Or should I stand my ground and keep telling her that she probably will waste a lot of money and safety with these \u201cpets\u201d?\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend wants to buy large, slightly or completely wild animals as pets. She has an impulsive personality, but comments on doing the training eventually even though her personality is usually \u201cbuy first, do work later\u201d. I was against it and she said I was underestimating her and tanking her mood. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: We both live in California but she has probably 4 different career paths on her mind right now, and she plans on moving to Hawaii. I still think it\u2019s illegal there. And she has said she is willing to move anywhere in the US that would allow large wild cats if there are no other options. I am also handicapped, so any way that this situation plays out would be with her making most of the money.\n\nEdit 2: Forgot to mention that we don\u2019t currently live together, but plan to within the year.

She wanted to hug a BEAR despite the fact that the claw marks alone would have been enough to have her bleed out in minutes, a claw to the gut would have ended her, then there\u2019s the fact that bears do not wait till you are dead to eat you. Your girlfriend goes way out of her way to humanize animals, when they honestly don\u2019t feel the wide array of emotions that humans do. \n\nHonestly, can you see yourself spending your entire life trying to talk her down from doing something damaging and dangerous?

As someone who has done work in wildlife rehabilitation, this is a red flag. She needs to prioritize her safety, and then the welfare of an animal. Keeping a puma or a wolf dog as a pet is never going to be in its best interest. Trying to pet a bear is not safe. She is not showing the necessary maturity to work with wildlife.

People who own savannah cats that are not bred down at least 3+ generations are insane people to me. \n\nShe should be working with a zoo or charity if she wants to work with these animals in some way NOT own them as pets.

A lot of wild animals owned as pets are stolen from their habitats where they are happy, and sold through the black market.

When I was a teenager my friend had a pet raccoon that he kept outside in a pen.  It was semi-domesticated and he would take it out of its pen and we would interact/play with it.  He was going on vacation and asked me to take care of it while he was gone.  He suggested I keep it at my house since he lived a few miles from me.  He had a fairly large traveling cage for it so I said sure.  Everything was going well until one day when I was gently playing with it out of nowhere it attacked me.  It grabbed my upper arm and started biting.  There was blood everywhere.  The whole incident just shocked me.  I managed to get it back in its cage.  After that I only fed and watered it.  Wouldn\u2019t let it out again.  When my friend got back I told him what happened and he gave the raccoon to a wildlife agency.  The raccoon was just being a raccoon.  They are not pets.

She sounds exhausting and out of touch with reality or common sense.", "NTA. There's a lot of romanticizing with the whole 'let's pet the wild bear' idea. I would worry about her getting bored with this large expensive cat with higher than usual needs, especially if it doesn't bond with her like she expects it to. Also, it's just a headache. Try to move? Sorry, no giant cats around. Trying to find a vet? Sorry, the closest exotics vet is 40 miles away and 20% more for everything. Want a vacation? Better pay more for someone suitable to care for it because most facilities can't accommodate them comfortably. Don't get me wrong, some people get them and do fine, but they aren't a great idea at this stage of your life, they're a limitation.", "NTA, wild animals are called wild  for a reason, not only is it a danger for humans but it also dangerous for the animal that is supposed to be living in a non-human habitat.  \n\n\nDoing the training *eventually* is completely out of the question.

If she did she would not be even contemplating supporting the wild animal pet trade. It's utterly vile and cruel. She's acting like a five year old. Next time I'd be real tempted to just let her pet the damn bear.", "NTA.\n\nShe also needs to look up the financial realities of the conservation field before committing to an animal that needs specific care and enclosures. \n\nMany wildlife people have to string together a living from seasonal work and travel a lot for years before getting year round employment. Talk to biologists and people in that field.\n\nGetting big expensive pet that no Land Lord will allow is a huge and short sighted mistake.", "NTA.

They take a lot of time to socialise, they almost never will be cuddly or tolerate much handling, you need to organise life around them and they will revert to wild instincts when pushed. \n\nIf she wants to cuddle wild bears, she is going to be disappointed that her chosen pet does not instinctively fall in love with her.
