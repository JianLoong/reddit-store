The concert we were at was in the basement of a local bar and was standing room only. It was quite packed for such a small space. \n\nWhile we were waiting for the opener a couple of younger girls (maybe in high school? I can never tell lol) in front of us walked away and were talking about getting an uber. My friend and I stepped forward into their spots, happy to be a couple feet closer to the stage. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later as the show is finally starting the girls return, and we heard them arguing with others behind us to \u201clet them back to their spot\u201d. When they came up behind us one of them screamed in my ear to move, and the other lightly shoved my friend. I told them this wasn\u2019t their spot and tried explaining that they left their spot in the crowd, it\u2019s fair game. They freaked out, screaming at the both of us, but thankfully the crowd around us agreed and told them to get lost. They stormed off and called us many names before going. \n\nDespite the crowd agreeing with us, friends we talked to after the concert have said we were AHs for not taking into account that these girls were young and might not have understood they might not get their spot back.

That's how they learn. Because of their youth and ignorance, you might consider forgiving them, but that has nothing to do with the etiquette of general admission at concerts.

Its a concert.... It probably happened in the pit..", "NTA.  They know now.", "NTA, they now have learned that you can\u2019t leave a spot at a show and just stand up front. Good job teaching them, they had to learn some time.", "\"these girls were young and might not have understood they might not get their spot back.\" - They understand now - NTA", "NTA.  As the saying goes, \"you snooze, you lose.\"  And they lost their spot.  It doesn't matter how old they are.  If they are going to an adult event at a bar, then they must be adults.  Adult enough to know you don't get to save your spot once you've moved.  And the way they tried to get their spots back make them huge AH's.", "NTA.  Shuffle your feet...lose your seat!", "NTA. Standing room at a concert is fair game. If you move, you forfeit your right to  the spot.", "Yeah if they had told us or asked their friend to stay to hold the spot or something I totally would\u2019ve helped, but it really seemed like they were leaving anyways.", "It was an all ages show, so they could\u2019ve been a bit younger. For some reason they can do those shows in bars before a certain time. But thank you!!", "First-timers at events like this don\u2019t realise that as soon as they abandon their spot, it gets taken and won\u2019t be given back. At cons, for example, majority of times, there are lots of people on the lookout for vacated seats and will swoop in the moment you move away.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t realise that\u2019s how it is, I guess it can be galling to realise you gave up a great spot. But they won\u2019t make that mistake again.  \nNTA.", "Yeah it absolutely could\u2019ve been their first show like this, which is why I felt a bit bad when my friends disagreed with us haha.

Anybody with common sense would know that if they leave the spot in that situation, they were going to lose it.", "NTA I have gone to shows for years and when its GA it's always a free for all. They will know better next time. Also they left for a long time. If they had just gone to the bathroom I would maybe understand.", "NTA and I think a lot of people are missing the assault that happened. The friend got shoved by one of the girls.

If they didn't understand before, they do now.", "NTA concert etiquette really got fucked by covid; the teens and YA have no clue how shit works and theyre so entitled sometimes as a result.

Any bar I\u2019ve ever seen any kind of show at you would absolutely get the shit kicked out of you if you tried to reclaim a crowd spot by shouting and pushing people. \n\nAnd for the record \u2018that\u2019s my spot\u2019  isn\u2019t a thing if you don\u2019t have assigned seats.", "NTA - they have been young and not understood.      \nThey do now", ">was standing room only.\n\nThere is no spots to give back to them.  Its standing room. How do you give back something that doesn't exist?  You stand.  That's it.  If you get pushed or shift bc you're dancing that's your new spot. \n\nNTA"]}
