Within the 4 years there have been many problems with his kids and his meddling ex wife.\nThey come to stay with us during the holidays which is nice. We do fun things together or just hang out at the house but sometimes can get a bit much. They don't tidy up after themselves. Leaving clothes and rubbish around the house and cause a fuss when asked to clean up. My husband has told me not to ask them to clean them after themselves because they are not here to do housework. I am the one that always cooks and cleans up after them while he sits around doing nothing.\nThe last time they came I asked them all what they wanted to eat twice and I got no respond so I told them there's food in the fridge and to warm it if they want, I asked the 6 year old what she would like. As I went into the kitchen to prepares her food, my husband comes storming at me telling me how horrible I am to tell them to warm up their own food. As I was trying to explain to him that they ignored me he continued to shout at me telling me to leave him alone.\nNaturally I left him alone and went to check on my 4 month old and stayed in my room for the rest of the day.\nThe next day the oldest children are up cooking eggs for their siblings. They are clearly capable of caring for themselves.\nThere is always a fuss whenever they come over and I've reached my limit. I am exhausted from doing all the housework all the time with no help and now I have a baby to care for also, the pressure is just too much. \nMy husband and I have now not spoken for several days as I refuse to apologise for what happened because I believe I have no reason to. I have stayed out of their way and focused on my baby only.\nI no longer want to be here when they come as its so exhausting and really affects my marriage.

Since she has no rights to ask them to do things, then she has no responsibility towards them either. \n\n>a group of children as young as 8\n\nThe oldests are 14 and 15. Old enough to know how to make a sandwich. Or, you know, their dad can do it.", "They are not HER guests, they are her husband's kids.\n\nI don't have stepkids and I've never been a stepkid, but blended families I know treat the kids much more like residents than like guests, no matter how much or how little time they spend at that house.\n\nEven if that's not the case in this family, ok, let's say the kids are 100% guests when they're at OP's house. So her husband invited over 6 guests while there is an infant in the house and expects OP to do ALL the work of cooking for them and picking up after them while he does nothing. OP (in this hypothetical) is definitely not a great hostess. But instead of stepping in to take care of HIS guests, husband berates her for her shortcomings (in front of the guests) and then stops speaking to her. He is TA no matter how you interpret the kids' position in this household.", "They're not guests lol it's their house as much as it's my own. Lol the 15 year old cooks dinner for the whole family when they're with their mum", "Whether the kids are messy or not isn't even relevant to the point here, she just included that to make the kids sound bad when clearly the 14 and 15 year old are being made to cook meals for not only themselves but their 4 siblings (which OP admitted they do all the time). They sound capable enough to me - she's still the TH for being a bad host to visitors (children visitors at that).", "> His kids - his responsibility to clean after them. It doesn't matter how many hours op works, they're not her kids.\n\nAwful take. If you had nieces and nephews that visited you would you refuse to cook for them because they aren't your kids? I hope not. Same goes for step-children.\n\n>The oldests are 14 and 15. Old enough to know how to make a sandwich. \n\nI wouldn't even ask an adult to make themself a sandwich in my home... part of hosting people is preparing meals, especially for kids.", "> They are not HER guests, they are her husband's kids.\n\nThey are literally visitors in her home... that is the definition of being a guest lol. Whether it's her or her husband, one of them should be making food for them. \n\n>I don't have stepkids and I've never been a stepkid, but blended families I know treat the kids much more like residents than like guests, no matter how much or how little time they spend at that house.\n\nIf you're burdening a 14 year old and 15 year old to cook for not only themselves but their 4 siblings, you're not just a bad host but a bad parent/stepparent. You are their provider. Provide.\n\n>So her husband invited over 6 guests while there is an infant in the house and expects OP to do ALL the work of cooking for them and picking up after them while he does nothing.\n\nThere isn't enough info in this post to say what the husband does around the house or if their arrangement is fair or not. If the husband works 50 hours a week and she works 20 for example, her doing most of the housework would be perfectly fair.", ">They come to stay with us during the holidays which is nice.\n\nSounds like they don't live with you. They occasionally visit, which makes them guests. If they lived in the house it would be a different story, but they dont", "Being a bad host to visitors LMAO you are next level ridiculous.", "No matter what their arrangement normally is, I do not think it is fair for one spouse to be assigned the full burden of accommodating the other spouse's guests. Even if she were a SAHM that would only be reasonable if she willingly agreed to it."]}
