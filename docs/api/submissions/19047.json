Within the 4 years there have been many problems with his kids and his meddling ex wife.\nThey come to stay with us during the holidays which is nice. We do fun things together or just hang out at the house but sometimes can get a bit much. They don't tidy up after themselves. Leaving clothes and rubbish around the house and cause a fuss when asked to clean up. My husband has told me not to ask them to clean them after themselves because they are not here to do housework. I am the one that always cooks and cleans up after them while he sits around doing nothing.\nThe last time they came I asked them all what they wanted to eat twice and I got no respond so I told them there's food in the fridge and to warm it if they want, I asked the 6 year old what she would like. As I went into the kitchen to prepares her food, my husband comes storming at me telling me how horrible I am to tell them to warm up their own food. As I was trying to explain to him that they ignored me he continued to shout at me telling me to leave him alone.\nNaturally I left him alone and went to check on my 4 month old and stayed in my room for the rest of the day.\nThe next day the oldest children are up cooking eggs for their siblings. They are clearly capable of caring for themselves.\nThere is always a fuss whenever they come over and I've reached my limit. I am exhausted from doing all the housework all the time with no help and now I have a baby to care for also, the pressure is just too much. \nMy husband and I have now not spoken for several days as I refuse to apologise for what happened because I believe I have no reason to. I have stayed out of their way and focused on my baby only.\nI no longer want to be here when they come as its so exhausting and really affects my marriage.
