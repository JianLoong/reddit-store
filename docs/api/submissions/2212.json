He hasn't seen her actual wedding dress (I have) but he knows the general direction of what she'd go for. I've seen the dress and honestly I'm certain my brother will despise it.\n\nSecondly, she's died her hair into a dirty blonde shade and changed her natural hair color which was chocolate brown. My brother adores natural hair and everything natural to be honest so the drastic change she made just a while before the wedding, he's not a fan of it.\n\nThirdly it's the thing that broke the camel's back for me and lead me to speak up about her behavior. She's doing a full glam makeup for the wedding which my brother hates. He prefers a light, natural makeup. The whole thing bothers me because while I understand its her wedding, I think she fails to realise its also my brother's wedding and she doesn't respect any of his opinions regarding this. She just does whatever she pleases and expects my brother to just suck it up as if his opinion on how this wedding will unroll and his opinion on certain choices doesn't matter.\n\nSo couple days ago I addressed this to her and I made sure my brother knows he's on the right and that I'm on his side. So I addressed it while both of them were present and I said that Mary is being really self centered and kind of an AH for not taking into account my brother's opinions and I reminded her how it's also his wedding not just hers.\n\nShe went into full defense mode and said that she values his opinion on general stuff like the decorations or what kind of song they'll dance to but she won't let my brother dictate her appearance and that I should take my unsolicited advice and shove it. My brother barely reacted and when I looked at him to step in her said \"you reap what you sow\" which pretty much means I brought this on myself.\n\nI was just trying to do a nice thing and stick up for my brother just for him to throw me under the bus. Anyone I've told this to has said I acted like an AH and it was not my business to get involved in the first place and I really don't understand this narrative.\n\nCould I really be TA for wanting to defend my brother?", "created_utc": 1668355193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu5o55/aita_for_telling_my_soon_to_be_sil_shes_an_ah_for/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And to be quite honest, none of these issue are even remotely close to a big deal.", "YTA. This has to be fake- of course YTA. She gets to look however she wants on her wedding day.", "YTA - 100%. She gets to decide how she wants to look on her wedding day. \n\nIt's none of your business and I think it's very weird, possessive behavior on your part to try to dictate how she will look.\n\nYou're lucky you are still invited.", "Does she comment on what he would like to wear?\nDoes she address how his hairstyle should be?\nDoes she talk about the colour of his hair?\nThese topics are based on HER choices about HERself. YTA.", "YTA. You know everything you mention about the \"wedding\" is just what she's wearing or her style, right? You and your brother are both AHs here. This is all just really gross.", "YTA\n\nHope someone does the same for you on your wedding day.", "YTA- SIL is right, she does not need to compromise her wardrobe and makeup choice for your brothers preference. This is not you brothers wedding\u2026this is BOTH of their wedding and she deserves to have her preferences too ESPECIALLY her physical appearance. No groom has any right to dictate or control hair,dress,or makeup. You pushing this is showing unhealthy relationship opinions/beliefs on your part.\nI feel bad for \u201cMary\u201d", "Wow, you're the king of all the AH. I could understand if your future SIL didn't listen to your brother about IMPORTANT aspects of a wedding, like the ceremony, religious aspects, or the guest list, but you're choosing to be an AH over what she is wearing? Talk about internalized misogyny, what the heck is your problem? Can't stand another woman to have any sort of choice that isn't dictated by a man? \n\nGo to therapy, stop bothering your brother and his future wife.", "Wow YTA. It\u2019s not your business at alllllllll. If your brother feels strongly about any of this he needs to be the one speaking up. You should not be involved.", "YTA the only person that gets to decide how the bride looks is the bride. If she was ignoring his opinion on everything else then that wouldn't be fair, but it still wouldn't be your place to intervene.", "YTA. Her appearance and her dress on her wedding day are her choices.", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding too, and she can damn well skippy wear what she wants, put on the makeup she wants, and do her hair as she likes. \n\nWho the hell made you the arbitrator of what she\u2019s allowed/not allowed to do or wear on her wedding day?  It\u2019s really none of your business, as you\u2019re not marrying her. \n\nLastly, you seriously put your relationship with your brother in jeopardy for THIS?  This is just such a bizarre hill to die on. You sound childish and immature.", "YTA It's also your future SIL's wedding too, and as the bride she can wear whatever style of wedding dress she decides she wants to wear. As for changing her hair colour and wearing makeup again that's her choice, and hers alone. \n\nYou do not get to dictate what your SIL does in regards to both hairstyle or makeup or even wedding dress style and neither does your brother. Your future SIL is right when she says she's not going to let anyone dictate what she wears.", "Ew. YTA. I thought it was actually essential wedding stuff they disagreed with. While in reality you\u2019re just mad you can\u2019t dictate her looks. \n\nShe surely should respect his preferences for locations or the menu etc. but her looks? That\u2019s her freaking business.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s called bodily autonomy.  Each of us is responsible for managing our own body. No one else gets to dictate.", "YTA repeat after me \"Women do not exist just to please men\".", "Omg are you also going to someday insist she stay at home with the kids because your brother just has to be the bread winner?\n\nLady, get your head on straight and realize that your brother\u2019s opinions about her looks don\u2019t matter. It honestly makes you both seem very controlling and I kinda worry for the fianc\u00e9", "YTA. \n\nStop trying to control someone else\u2019s appearance. It\u2019s not your business to care nor interfere. There is nothing more complicated than that.", "YTA because all the things you mentioned are to do with HER look, what's she going to wear/her own hair colour. That's up to her entirely. Other wedding stuff should be joint decisions but you're being an AH and very weird for thinking that her appearance should be your brother's choice. She doesn't exist for his aesthetic enjoyment, she's her own person and if he hates her personal style that's really his problem not hers.\n\nEdit just to say I am happy after reading it again that the brother/groom to be doesn't seem to think his fiancee has to dress for his taste. Makes it even weirder that OP does though!", "YTA. Complete A H 100%\n\nAll of the things you are bitching about are none of your business. Are you always so sexist? Her appearance is completely her own choice.", "YTA. Your brother is right. It wasn\u2019t your place to stick your nose in.", "YTA. If she wanted to have the wedding be totally pirate themed and your brother hated pirates then *maybe* it would be your place to say something. \n\nIt's their wedding. She's the bride. She gets to pick what she wears. She gets to pick how she looks. If your brother was worried about it then *he* needed to say something. Instead you did so now if he really *does* have the problem you think he does it will be almost impossible for him to address it.", "YTA and i hope you realise that being in love with your brother won\u2019t make him break up with his fiancee", "YTA. If she were unilaterally making decisions about the catering, music, guest list etc, then you might have a leg to stand on, but all of the decisions you're complaining about are how she's choosing to look for her wedding. It's her body and her choice. \n\nIt's also absolutely none of your business. Your brother can fight his own battles and doesn't need you picking fights with his fiancee on his behalf.", "YTA just because people complain about things, does not mean that they actually want things to change OR that it\u2019s your job to try and help/fix\n\nFirst, if your brother is that displeased, he can grow some and say something himself. If he doesn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s HIS business. Maybe he knows if he complains about this petty stuff he realizes he\u2019d loose his bride. \n\nSecond, just because a man likes natural hair, does not mean his wife needs to have natural hair. Just because a man likes natural looking makeup does not mean his wife needs to have natural looking makeup. And don\u2019t get me started on a man choosing the style of dress! Wow. I hope you can maybe understand this now. Please stop living in 1950.", "YTA, but this is like comic-book \"sister vs SIL\" fiction.", "YTA stay out of it and mind your own business!", "YTA. First it\u2019s not your place to say anything. Second the bride gets to look how she wants to look. Stay in your lane", "YTA and insufferable for even thinking of interfering in this scenario.", "YTA and massive.    Wait for the uninvite.  Any decent human being wants somebody else to feel comfortable in what you they wear or style. \n\nI do not think any job offers from fashion magazines are arriving soon so please sit down with your SIL and apologize no buts just apologize!  There is no excuse for not your behaviour.", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL is right - it\u2019s their wedding, but it\u2019s **her** appearance, therefore **her** choice. \n\nYour brother also clearly isn\u2019t as peeved about this as you are - if he decided it wasn\u2019t worth bringing up with his future wife, you absolutely should not have.", "YTA your brother is a big boy and can fight his own battles. This is so very much none of your business. Stay out of their marriage.", "YTA. It ain\u2019t your wedding, butt-in-ski.", "YTA you \u201cknow\u201d far too much about your brothers preferences for his romantic partner. You were way out of line. Your brother is a grown man and can speak up for himself. And seriously how do you know your brother will \u201cdespise\u201d the dress she chose. Sounds like this is all your opinion and not his. You have a very low chance of salvaging your relationship with either of them.", "YTA- she's the bride but most importantly she needs to adjust her appearance for what she wants...not what any man wants her to look like. He doesn't deserve to be with any woman if he thinks he can tell someone how to dress or do their hair or makeup!", "YTA.  How is this any of your business?  Have you even asked your brother if he has a problem?  And if he does, why is he incapable of discussing this with his soon to be wife?", "The bride made a HUGE mistake by including you in her wedding planning.", "YTA, also your future sister in law shouldn\u2019t marry your brother. If he\u2019s this much a prick now they will be divorced in 5 years.", "Your right, you should dictate how a bride dresses and does her hair and makeup as the, checks notes, sibling of the groom.\n\nYou should also be in charge of flowers, food, decorations, transportation, and all other wedding planning, as well as the costs of the wedding.

I'm sure that he has. Perhaps, your brother, \"Joe\", who is an adult, wants \"Mary\", whom he has decided to spend the rest of his life with to be happy and feel her best on THEIR wedding day.\n\nYou can pretend that you were looking out for your brother, but you weren't. Your brother is an adult.\n\n\"Mary\" isn't doing what you want. Your confrontation had nothing to do with \"Joe\" at all. His existence was a convenience for you to criticize \"Mary\"s\" decisions.", "YTA this has nothing to do with you, you just want to be a white knight saving the day over things that she has every right to do", "When op said soon to be SIL wasn't respecting brother's wishes for the wedding I thought it would be something like the venue, music, flowers... \nI'm sure your brother is wearing whatever he wants. Why shouldn't the bride be able to do the same? She wants to wear a specific type of dress? That's great. She wants full glam make up and hair? Great!! I'm sure she'll look gorgeous. \n\nYTA because you tryed to make her feel wrong and invalidate her decisions. I'm glad your brother didn't support you.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like you gave advice, but more like you **told** her she is disregarding your brothers preferences.\n\n I can imagine somebody timidly, with the utmost care, bringing up 'I've seen some of your choices. You both are OK with it?' and then **shutting up**. Whether anybody says yes or no, shut up. Because it is their day, and you are not, in this, your brothers guardian.", "YTA-- so for the entirety of the marriage, she cannot dress up how she wants because her husband doesn't like it?

Yta regardless  of age.", "YTAH, you're stirring up drama. It's their relationship and you're intruding. No one asked for your opinion. She deserves to feel beautiful at their wedding.

These things that he\u2019s bothered by (at least that you listed) are only to do with her body/appearance. He does not get to control that.

My fianc\u00e9 has never even seen ideas for what dress I\u2019d wear and he already knows he\u2019ll love it. Because he loves how I dress and my style/vibe. When I talk about cutting my hair he\u2019s always supportive that I\u2019ll be beautiful even fringe (he\u2019s not a fan of fringe or me with fringe and will say that but it has helped keep me from impulse cutting my hair with fringe). He seems he wants the idea of a person not the actual person.", "YTA Who you think you are, trying to control another person's appearance?", "YTA.

If the situation had been that Mary is making every choice on her own, such as the venue, decorations etc, then you speaking up could have been appropriate.

He\u2019s not going to like her wedding dress? He doesn\u2019t have to wear it. He doesn\u2019t like her hair dyed? It\u2019s not his. And guys views on makeup can F off.

Your are definitely TA. Get a boyfriend or a hobby.", "YTA. I feel like this has to be fake. But on the off chance it isn\u2019t\u2026seek therapy.

So if he has no right to interfere what on earth makes you think you can!!", "YTA The things that you complaining about are how she looks its hr body her choice so yeah you should take youd opinion and shove it", "YTA. Butt out. She didn\u2019t ask for your opinion, and he didn\u2019t ask for your help. And since you apparently are unaware-she gets to decide how she looks at her wedding. She does in fact have bodily autonomy, and getting married doesn\u2019t change that. Back off.", "Yta. You did not defend your brother , you attacked every choice the bride bride made regarding her appearance? Why ? What does it have to do with you ? Why is your brothers preferences matter more then the brides. You just looking for a reason to cause trouble with the bride and fail to see that eventually she will be the mother of any nieces and nephews. Rather try and start off on a good foot with her  then ruin it over trivial nonsense.", "YTA   \n\n\n\"I should take my unsolicited advice and shove it.\"  \n\n\nYes, you really should.", "YTA. \n\nHer dress. \nHer hair. \nHer face. \nHer choice. \n\nIf your brother doesn\u2019t want to dye his hair dirty blonde, wear that style of dress or have full glam he doesn\u2019t have to. \n\nAnd you need to grow up and not stick your nose into other peoples business.", " YTA\n\nIf she was cheating on him or something truly terrible, I would say you have a right to step in to protect your brother. But as much as it\u2019s both their weddings and I know your brother DOES care, women are raised playing wedding and thinking about marriage more than men do (societal sexism that causes this is a whole other can of worms I\u2019ll not get into here). She\u2019s been thinking about this day probably most of her life, and she has known how she wants to look on her wedding day. Chances are, your brother has had conversations with her about this, and while she wants to make choices that are not your brother\u2019s preference, he seems to understand it is important to her (and also, that he thinks she is beautiful regardless of hair color, make up, or dress style). \n\nYou inserted yourself into a situation that didn\u2019t involve you to \u201cstick up for\u201d your brother so that he\u2026won\u2019t have to look at his future wife with unnatural hair? It was a bear of an overreaction, and one I would have reamed my brother out for. You got off lucky.", "YTA. Also, kinda weird how you never said that your brother ever actually stated he didn\u2019t like these things, and yet somehow you\u2019re 100% certain you know he will hate everything about her appearance and style the day of the wedding. You sound like you\u2019re jealous and that\u2019s just weird. The point is for her to feel beautiful with herself, and it sounds like she does. Also, if he wasn\u2019t attracted to her at all (which is exactly what you\u2019re implying), I highly doubt he would be marrying her. Controlling someone\u2019s appearance is not at all \u201csticking up\u201d for your brother.", "YTA...... its not you or your brothers right to dictate what Mary does with her appearance. I am married and I would never let my husband dictate what kind or makeup or hair color I have. It's not called compromise, it's called being controlled. Marriage doesn't mean that your surrender your identity and your body autonomy. Just like I would never dictate how my husband looks. We offer our opinion to each other if or when the other asks. \n\nAnd certainly wasn't your place to step in. Mind your business.", "Oh boy. This post is so asinine it has to be fake.

Sure if he is with her for her appearance go ahead and get that marriage stopped before it's to late. If not, then mind your own business.

He hasn't seen her actual wedding dress (I have) but he knows the general direction of what she'd go for. I've seen the dress and honestly I'm certain my brother will despise it.\n\nSecondly, she's died her hair into a dirty blonde shade and changed her natural hair color which was chocolate brown. My brother adores natural hair and everything natural to be honest so the drastic change she made just a while before the wedding, he's not a fan of it.\n\nThirdly it's the thing that broke the camel's back for me and lead me to speak up about her behavior. She's doing a full glam makeup for the wedding which my brother hates. He prefers a light, natural makeup. The whole thing bothers me because while I understand its her wedding, I think she fails to realise its also my brother's wedding and she doesn't respect any of his opinions regarding this. She just does whatever she pleases and expects my brother to just suck it up as if his opinion on how this wedding will unroll and his opinion on certain choices doesn't matter.\n\nSo couple days ago I addressed this to her and I made sure my brother knows he's on the right and that I'm on his side. So I addressed it while both of them were present and I said that Mary is being really self centered and kind of an AH for not taking into account my brother's opinions and I reminded her how it's also his wedding not just hers.\n\nShe went into full defense mode and said that she values his opinion on general stuff like the decorations or what kind of song they'll dance to but she won't let my brother dictate her appearance and that I should take my unsolicited advice and shove it. My brother barely reacted and when I looked at him to step in her said \"you reap what you sow\" which pretty much means I brought this on myself.\n\nI was just trying to do a nice thing and stick up for my brother just for him to throw me under the bus. Anyone I've told this to has said I acted like an AH and it was not my business to get involved in the first place and I really don't understand this narrative.\n\nCould I really be TA for wanting to defend my brother?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Lol YTA, the best thing for you to do for your brother is convince him not to marry this poor girl so she doesn\u2019t have to experience the nightmare that I imagine being your SIL will be.", "YTA\n\nSIL is right. All you complaints are about things she is doing to her own body/self. Your brother was right also, you gave an opinion nobody asked you for. \n\nYou are gotse all the way on this one.", "YTA and so is your brother. It is the brides day to feel beautiful, it is infact only one day out of a lifetime. You and your brother should be less selfish. After all he is not the one wearing the gown or the makeup. I hope she sees all the red flags that is your family and decides to run for the hills", "YTA and have weird boundaries when it comes to your brother. Back off there, not your wedding, not your problem.", "Yeah, YTA. You're thinking of this as \"defending your brother\", but what you fail to realise is that the bride making choices about what she wants to wear is not an attack on your brother. She isn't doing it against him, and he doesn't need you to defend him. \n\nYou are interfering in something that is purely between your brother and his wife-to-be. No, worse than that - it's not even a wedding decision that they're sharing but a *bride decision* that is hers and hers alone to make. Women get to choose what they wear. End of story. She is not a decoration for your brother's wedding. Her dress, her hair, her make-up - it's her choice not anyone else's.", "YTA.\n\nIf your brother isn't bothered you shouldn't be bothered.\n\nAnd future SIL is right - while he absolutely should have input on the day, his job when it comes to her dress, hair, makeup is to be happy she looks and feels the way she wanted to. It is not up to him - OR YOU!!! - to dictate how she wants to look. \n\nIt also sounds like you've just assumed what you think your brother likes but he doesn't actually have an issue. So you aren't defending him at all. \n\nYou made assumptions and overstepped and you should apologise.", "YTA....your brother doesn't get to control what his bride looks like or how she dresses. Marriage doesn't mean the groom is the boss of the bride. Huge red flags when a man dictates how a women dresses, their makeup and hair color. I dunno why you involved  yourself in the first place.  You basically  just ruined any chance of a relationship  with your SIL.  Also it doesn't seem like your brother  would be as quick to step  up for you as he left  you to reap what you sowed.", "How fucking DARE you! Like the nerve of you is just unbelievable. You intervene in your brothers relationship in order to tell your SIL he doesn't like how she looks? And you think youre not the most enormous asshole ever? Dude. YTA.", "YTA, it's not between you and them. Move along sis.", "YTA. You might have a point if she wanted to decide menu, decorating, guest list etc. without his input. But her own appearance is her own thing. Butt out.", "YTA-Your brother gets to decide how he looks for their wedding. She gets to decide how she looks for their wedding.  The only thing you get to decide is whether or not to act like an asshole and in choosing to do so you made the wrong choice.", "YTA Her appearance is 100% her choice to make. Not her fianc\u00e9, and certainly not her soon-to-be BIL !", "Yes you are TA it's not your weeding to keep out of it it's not your business \n\nYour SIL is right she shouldn't let anyone decide how she looks she should wear what she is comfortable with ans  have her hair the way she likes", "Info: so, of mary wanted your brother to wear a different Suit than he wants or have his hair a way he doesnt Like....would you want him to comply?", "\"You reap what you sow\" was aimed at you, how can you not realise that \ud83e\udd23 He was saying \"If you are going to spout shit that us none of your business then you should expect a reaction\" \n\nAnyway, YTA, there are too many reasons to go into why but this is definitely going to be unanimous so the reasons will be well covered", "I don\u2019t think you are TA. If she doesn\u2019t respect your brother\u2019s wishes, even if they\u2019re small things such as makeup and hair, then that marriage will NOT last. She will keep disrespecting him with every big decision they make in the future.\n\nEdit: I might get downvoted because \u201cit\u2019s her choice\u201d yeah, but she has to take into consideration how her future husband feels about it. That\u2019s called respect. Something she is already lacking\u2026", "The thing is that be doesn't fight for his opinions to be heard so I stepped up for him. He says he doesn't like x thing about what Mary does to her appearance. He doesn't complain to her but he always vents to me and our parents about how Mary did this and that thing that he hates. But he never defends himself to Mary and I thought he'd appreciate if someone defended him.", "But...but, she dyed her hair...*when she knew that he only likes natural colors*!", "This is what I was thinking too. The groom gets NO say in her dress, hair, or makeup. If this is true he\u2019s a controlling red flag and she should run. OP, YTA.", "Why the brother as well?", "I'm already married and I always took my husband's opinions seriously whenever he didn't like something I liked. It's called compromise.", "This comment should be higher. It is internalized misogyny to think he\u2019s entitled to dictate what her hair and face and body looks like.

YTA, op.", "This exactly! These are not wedding choices they are personal styles choices of the bride. The groom has zero say in what style dress she wears!

YTA!!", "exactly she should stay in her own lane", "It doesn\u2019t actually sound like the brother is mad, OP just decided this on his general preferences.", "This right here. Sounds like brother was just venting. I don\u2019t care for his opinions but he wasn\u2019t trying to force them on the bride. OP did not need to escalate it like that", "she should also pay for all these things while she\u2019s at it", "Yes!!! Thank you.", "I don\u2019t think we can call brother an A H at this point. He did side with his bride over OP here. Plus, we aren\u2019t even sure what his preferences are. We only know what OP thinks his preferences are.", "Or, maybe they are turn ons for the groom.

But the OP has no such right.", "How is the brother an AH? He may not be happy with some of the Bride\u2019s choices, but is clearly not standing in her way. You are allowed to not like the things your partner is doing. How you act (or don\u2019t act) on those feelings is what makes you an AH or not.

Her appearance for her wedding is for her. Your brother is right to defend his future wife from being attacked for her looks she is making for her own wedding. You're way out of line. You started off all wrong and now you strained your relationship with them. This was an awful choice to make to talk to her like that in front of your brother.", "Yes she is TA, but saying her brother is as well is a bad take.

Literally her body and her face. \nWe also don\u2019t know how much input she has had on his suit, tie, hair cut, etc. \nif she was taking control of the whole wedding, sure I would agree with you but this is a dress and her body. You should marry the husband and have no say over your appearance.", "I do see lacking of certain things, both in this post and this comment, and her respect isn't one of them", "So by dying her hair a different colour she\u2019s disrespecting him, I suppose she shouldn\u2019t have a job because then she\u2019s disrespecting him by earning her own money, or she shouldn\u2019t have her own opinions in case he doesn\u2019t think the same because it\u2019s disrespectful. In fact she should just stop being her own person with her own mind and become whatever her husband wants, that\u2019s the only way to show respect", "Flip it around, you prefer natural make-up but your partner prefers fake eyelashes the length of your arm, blue eyeshadow and bright lips and cheeks.
