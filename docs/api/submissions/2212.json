{"id": 2212, "submission_id": "yu5o55", "title": "AITA for telling my soon to be SIL she's an AH for not respecting my brother's wishes for their wedding?", "selftext": "(fake names)\n\nMy brother Jace is getting married in a month to his fianc\u00e9e Mary and there have been a lot of instances where my brother is displeased with the bride to be's choices.\n\nOne instance is how he doesn't like the style of wedding dresses she likes. He hasn't seen her actual wedding dress (I have) but he knows the general direction of what she'd go for. I've seen the dress and honestly I'm certain my brother will despise it.\n\nSecondly, she's died her hair into a dirty blonde shade and changed her natural hair color which was chocolate brown. My brother adores natural hair and everything natural to be honest so the drastic change she made just a while before the wedding, he's not a fan of it.\n\nThirdly it's the thing that broke the camel's back for me and lead me to speak up about her behavior. She's doing a full glam makeup for the wedding which my brother hates. He prefers a light, natural makeup. The whole thing bothers me because while I understand its her wedding, I think she fails to realise its also my brother's wedding and she doesn't respect any of his opinions regarding this. She just does whatever she pleases and expects my brother to just suck it up as if his opinion on how this wedding will unroll and his opinion on certain choices doesn't matter.\n\nSo couple days ago I addressed this to her and I made sure my brother knows he's on the right and that I'm on his side. So I addressed it while both of them were present and I said that Mary is being really self centered and kind of an AH for not taking into account my brother's opinions and I reminded her how it's also his wedding not just hers.\n\nShe went into full defense mode and said that she values his opinion on general stuff like the decorations or what kind of song they'll dance to but she won't let my brother dictate her appearance and that I should take my unsolicited advice and shove it. My brother barely reacted and when I looked at him to step in her said \"you reap what you sow\" which pretty much means I brought this on myself.\n\nI was just trying to do a nice thing and stick up for my brother just for him to throw me under the bus. Anyone I've told this to has said I acted like an AH and it was not my business to get involved in the first place and I really don't understand this narrative.\n\nCould I really be TA for wanting to defend my brother?", "created_utc": 1668355193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu5o55/aita_for_telling_my_soon_to_be_sil_shes_an_ah_for/", "score": 1353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Eyeliner and hair dye?\n\nGet over yourself.", "YTA \n\nMind your own business. It\u2019s not your wedding. And to be quite honest, none of these issue are even remotely close to a big deal.", "YTA. This has to be fake- of course YTA. She gets to look however she wants on her wedding day.", "YTA - 100%. She gets to decide how she wants to look on her wedding day. \n\nIt's none of your business and I think it's very weird, possessive behavior on your part to try to dictate how she will look.\n\nYou're lucky you are still invited.", "Does she comment on what he would like to wear?\nDoes she address how his hairstyle should be?\nDoes she talk about the colour of his hair?\nThese topics are based on HER choices about HERself. YTA.", "YTA. You know everything you mention about the \"wedding\" is just what she's wearing or her style, right? You and your brother are both AHs here. This is all just really gross.", "YTA\n\nHope someone does the same for you on your wedding day.", "YTA- SIL is right, she does not need to compromise her wardrobe and makeup choice for your brothers preference. This is not you brothers wedding\u2026this is BOTH of their wedding and she deserves to have her preferences too ESPECIALLY her physical appearance. No groom has any right to dictate or control hair,dress,or makeup. You pushing this is showing unhealthy relationship opinions/beliefs on your part.\nI feel bad for \u201cMary\u201d", "Wow, you're the king of all the AH. I could understand if your future SIL didn't listen to your brother about IMPORTANT aspects of a wedding, like the ceremony, religious aspects, or the guest list, but you're choosing to be an AH over what she is wearing? Talk about internalized misogyny, what the heck is your problem? Can't stand another woman to have any sort of choice that isn't dictated by a man? \n\nGo to therapy, stop bothering your brother and his future wife.", "Wow YTA. It\u2019s not your business at alllllllll. If your brother feels strongly about any of this he needs to be the one speaking up. You should not be involved.", "YTA the only person that gets to decide how the bride looks is the bride. If she was ignoring his opinion on everything else then that wouldn't be fair, but it still wouldn't be your place to intervene.", "YTA. Her appearance and her dress on her wedding day are her choices.", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding too, and she can damn well skippy wear what she wants, put on the makeup she wants, and do her hair as she likes. \n\nWho the hell made you the arbitrator of what she\u2019s allowed/not allowed to do or wear on her wedding day?  It\u2019s really none of your business, as you\u2019re not marrying her. \n\nLastly, you seriously put your relationship with your brother in jeopardy for THIS?  This is just such a bizarre hill to die on. You sound childish and immature.", "YTA It's also your future SIL's wedding too, and as the bride she can wear whatever style of wedding dress she decides she wants to wear. As for changing her hair colour and wearing makeup again that's her choice, and hers alone. \n\nYou do not get to dictate what your SIL does in regards to both hairstyle or makeup or even wedding dress style and neither does your brother. Your future SIL is right when she says she's not going to let anyone dictate what she wears.", "Ew. YTA. I thought it was actually essential wedding stuff they disagreed with. While in reality you\u2019re just mad you can\u2019t dictate her looks. \n\nShe surely should respect his preferences for locations or the menu etc. but her looks? That\u2019s her freaking business.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s called bodily autonomy.  Each of us is responsible for managing our own body. No one else gets to dictate.", "YTA repeat after me \"Women do not exist just to please men\".", "Omg are you also going to someday insist she stay at home with the kids because your brother just has to be the bread winner?\n\nLady, get your head on straight and realize that your brother\u2019s opinions about her looks don\u2019t matter. It honestly makes you both seem very controlling and I kinda worry for the fianc\u00e9", "YTA. \n\nStop trying to control someone else\u2019s appearance. It\u2019s not your business to care nor interfere. There is nothing more complicated than that.", "YTA because all the things you mentioned are to do with HER look, what's she going to wear/her own hair colour. That's up to her entirely. Other wedding stuff should be joint decisions but you're being an AH and very weird for thinking that her appearance should be your brother's choice. She doesn't exist for his aesthetic enjoyment, she's her own person and if he hates her personal style that's really his problem not hers.\n\nEdit just to say I am happy after reading it again that the brother/groom to be doesn't seem to think his fiancee has to dress for his taste. Makes it even weirder that OP does though!", "YTA. Complete A H 100%\n\nAll of the things you are bitching about are none of your business. Are you always so sexist? Her appearance is completely her own choice.", "YTA. Your brother is right. It wasn\u2019t your place to stick your nose in.", "YTA. If she wanted to have the wedding be totally pirate themed and your brother hated pirates then *maybe* it would be your place to say something. \n\nIt's their wedding. She's the bride. She gets to pick what she wears. She gets to pick how she looks. If your brother was worried about it then *he* needed to say something. Instead you did so now if he really *does* have the problem you think he does it will be almost impossible for him to address it.", "YTA and i hope you realise that being in love with your brother won\u2019t make him break up with his fiancee", "YTA. If she were unilaterally making decisions about the catering, music, guest list etc, then you might have a leg to stand on, but all of the decisions you're complaining about are how she's choosing to look for her wedding. It's her body and her choice. \n\nIt's also absolutely none of your business. Your brother can fight his own battles and doesn't need you picking fights with his fiancee on his behalf.", "YTA just because people complain about things, does not mean that they actually want things to change OR that it\u2019s your job to try and help/fix\n\nFirst, if your brother is that displeased, he can grow some and say something himself. If he doesn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s HIS business. Maybe he knows if he complains about this petty stuff he realizes he\u2019d loose his bride. \n\nSecond, just because a man likes natural hair, does not mean his wife needs to have natural hair. Just because a man likes natural looking makeup does not mean his wife needs to have natural looking makeup. And don\u2019t get me started on a man choosing the style of dress! Wow. I hope you can maybe understand this now. Please stop living in 1950.", "YTA, but this is like comic-book \"sister vs SIL\" fiction.", "YTA stay out of it and mind your own business!", "YTA. First it\u2019s not your place to say anything. Second the bride gets to look how she wants to look. Stay in your lane", "YTA and insufferable for even thinking of interfering in this scenario.", "YTA and massive.    Wait for the uninvite.  Any decent human being wants somebody else to feel comfortable in what you they wear or style. \n\nI do not think any job offers from fashion magazines are arriving soon so please sit down with your SIL and apologize no buts just apologize!  There is no excuse for not your behaviour.", "YTA.\n\nYour SIL is right - it\u2019s their wedding, but it\u2019s **her** appearance, therefore **her** choice. \n\nYour brother also clearly isn\u2019t as peeved about this as you are - if he decided it wasn\u2019t worth bringing up with his future wife, you absolutely should not have.", "YTA your brother is a big boy and can fight his own battles. This is so very much none of your business. Stay out of their marriage.", "YTA. It ain\u2019t your wedding, butt-in-ski.", "YTA you \u201cknow\u201d far too much about your brothers preferences for his romantic partner. You were way out of line. Your brother is a grown man and can speak up for himself. And seriously how do you know your brother will \u201cdespise\u201d the dress she chose. Sounds like this is all your opinion and not his. You have a very low chance of salvaging your relationship with either of them.", "YTA- she's the bride but most importantly she needs to adjust her appearance for what she wants...not what any man wants her to look like. He doesn't deserve to be with any woman if he thinks he can tell someone how to dress or do their hair or makeup!", "YTA.  How is this any of your business?  Have you even asked your brother if he has a problem?  And if he does, why is he incapable of discussing this with his soon to be wife?", "The bride made a HUGE mistake by including you in her wedding planning.", "YTA, also your future sister in law shouldn\u2019t marry your brother. If he\u2019s this much a prick now they will be divorced in 5 years.", "Your right, you should dictate how a bride dresses and does her hair and makeup as the, checks notes, sibling of the groom.\n\nYou should also be in charge of flowers, food, decorations, transportation, and all other wedding planning, as well as the costs of the wedding. Oh wait, it's NOT your wedding, so you should STFU and let the bride dress and do her hair an makeup as she pleases, you aren't even the one marrying her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA on so many levels!", "YTA \n\nYou are assuming that you know what your brother, an adult, who has decided to spend his life with \"Mary\". Likes. You are assuming that you know what your brother, an adult, who has decided to spend his life with \"Mary\" wants.\n\nYour brother, \"Joe\", who is an adult, is capable of speaking for himself. I'm sure that he has. Perhaps, your brother, \"Joe\", who is an adult, wants \"Mary\", whom he has decided to spend the rest of his life with to be happy and feel her best on THEIR wedding day.\n\nYou can pretend that you were looking out for your brother, but you weren't. Your brother is an adult.\n\n\"Mary\" isn't doing what you want. Your confrontation had nothing to do with \"Joe\" at all. His existence was a convenience for you to criticize \"Mary\"s\" decisions.", "YTA this has nothing to do with you, you just want to be a white knight saving the day over things that she has every right to do", "When op said soon to be SIL wasn't respecting brother's wishes for the wedding I thought it would be something like the venue, music, flowers... \nI'm sure your brother is wearing whatever he wants. Why shouldn't the bride be able to do the same? She wants to wear a specific type of dress? That's great. She wants full glam make up and hair? Great!! I'm sure she'll look gorgeous. \n\nYTA because you tryed to make her feel wrong and invalidate her decisions. I'm glad your brother didn't support you.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like you gave advice, but more like you **told** her she is disregarding your brothers preferences.\n\n I can imagine somebody timidly, with the utmost care, bringing up 'I've seen some of your choices. You both are OK with it?' and then **shutting up**. Whether anybody says yes or no, shut up. Because it is their day, and you are not, in this, your brothers guardian.", "YTA-- so for the entirety of the marriage, she cannot dress up how she wants because her husband doesn't like it? Does her family have the same obnoxious input on Jace's looks? Ew, just ew.", "Info: are you 13?\n\n\nShe's allowed  to wear the makeup she wants on her wedding  day, ffs.  Yta regardless  of age.", "YTAH, you're stirring up drama. It's their relationship and you're intruding. No one asked for your opinion. She deserves to feel beautiful at their wedding. What would you say if the situation was reversed and someone was telling your brother he should ignore what he wants and do what she wants instead? Would you be upset?", "YTA. \nYour brother will enjoy his wedding and be happily married if you stop your nose about your SIL.", "YTA. You, and NOBODY else has control over someone\u2019s appearance.", "You are projecting like a 200-screen movie theater.  You don't like your future SiL for whatever reason, and it shows.  You're being hateful towards her in the name of your brother, and that results in a YTA.\n\nShe is putting together a look for one day.  Your brother knows this.  They have the rest of their lives to look not-perfect in front of each other - let her feel pretty on her terms.", "YTA.  Her choices for how she looks are hers and hers alone.  No one, including your brother has any right to dictate what she does with her appearance.  It sounds like your brother knows and understands that which is why he doesn\u2019t say anything to his fianc\u00e9.  He may vent to his family because he has the right to dislike something but he\u2019s not forcing his preferences on her.  You on the other hand are fully enmeshed in the patriarchy", "YTA\nWho the Eff are you to police this woman\u2019s appearance?", "YTA. These things that he\u2019s bothered by (at least that you listed) are only to do with her body/appearance. He does not get to control that. Colour theme, flowers, which dj/band they choose, the caterer and menu, all are things he gets an equal say to. Make-up, the dress, her hair colour (this especially), nope. She\u2019s not being controlling but your brother is if he\u2019s actually upset about her appearance. And you\u2019re being controlling to tell her she needs to not be herself to make him happy.\n\nETA: After reading your comments why is he marrying her. He doesn\u2019t like how she makes herself look and stuff she does, I can\u2019t imagine being with someone that is like that. My fianc\u00e9 has never even seen ideas for what dress I\u2019d wear and he already knows he\u2019ll love it. Because he loves how I dress and my style/vibe. When I talk about cutting my hair he\u2019s always supportive that I\u2019ll be beautiful even fringe (he\u2019s not a fan of fringe or me with fringe and will say that but it has helped keep me from impulse cutting my hair with fringe). He seems he wants the idea of a person not the actual person.", "YTA Who you think you are, trying to control another person's appearance?", "YTA. All the things about the wedding that you said your brother would hate have to do with her appearance. She gets to decide how she looks. He gets to decide how he looks. They decide together pretty much the rest. And besides, it was not your place to speak up. It's between the two of them. Stay out of their business.", "Their relationship, their business.", "YTA the marriage is between them not the three of you. Whatever problem they have between each other they are the ones that need to figure it out. If he has a problem with this he needs to speak up not you. If he doesn\u2019t like the directions this is taking he is the one that needs to leave if that\u2019s what he wants. She has ever right to pick the dress she fell in love with, do her hair how she loves it, and do make up how she loves it.

Must be a family thing.", "YTA, it\u2019s not your business to tell her what she should be doing at her own wedding, and you\u2019re making it sound like she should disregard how she wants to dress at the chance the your brother wouldn\u2019t like it. What matters is how she wants to look, and if he has an issue with it he doesn\u2019t deserve a wife. If I was her I\u2019d remember that comment forever (cause it\u2019s super weird you even care to be honest), and uninvite you from the wedding", "YTA. If the situation had been that Mary is making every choice on her own, such as the venue, decorations etc, then you speaking up could have been appropriate. However since it is all about her appearance - you are 100% the AH here. She gets to decide how she will look on her wedding day. End of sentence, no ifs or buts. Simple as that.", "YTA. He\u2019s not going to like her wedding dress? He doesn\u2019t have to wear it. He doesn\u2019t like her hair dyed? It\u2019s not his. And guys views on makeup can F off. She doesn\u2019t have to give in and who the hell gave you the right to stick your nose in.", "YTA. \n\nYou need to get rid of that toxic mindset that women only exist to obey and cater to men's wishes real quick.", "YTA and so is your brother.

You haven\u2019t mentioned one thing your brother likes about her appearance - why is he marrying her then? Oh right, sounds like he just wants to control her every move.\n\nLeave her be and let her dress how she wants, and if she has any good sense, she\u2019ll leave your brother before she locks herself in with marriage.\n\nETA: YTA", "Ew. Your are definitely TA. Get a boyfriend or a hobby.", "YTA. I feel like this has to be fake. But on the off chance it isn\u2019t\u2026seek therapy. You know WAY too much about what your brother likes and doesn\u2019t like in women.

Butt out. She didn\u2019t ask for your opinion, and he didn\u2019t ask for your help. And since you apparently are unaware-she gets to decide how she looks at her wedding. She does in fact have bodily autonomy, and getting married doesn\u2019t change that. Back off.", "Yta. You did not defend your brother , you attacked every choice the bride bride made regarding her appearance? Why ? What does it have to do with you ?

But as much as it\u2019s both their weddings and I know your brother DOES care, women are raised playing wedding and thinking about marriage more than men do (societal sexism that causes this is a whole other can of worms I\u2019ll not get into here). She\u2019s been thinking about this day probably most of her life, and she has known how she wants to look on her wedding day. Chances are, your brother has had conversations with her about this, and while she wants to make choices that are not your brother\u2019s preference, he seems to understand it is important to her (and also, that he thinks she is beautiful regardless of hair color, make up, or dress style). \n\nYou inserted yourself into a situation that didn\u2019t involve you to \u201cstick up for\u201d your brother so that he\u2026won\u2019t have to look at his future wife with unnatural hair?

Also, kinda weird how you never said that your brother ever actually stated he didn\u2019t like these things, and yet somehow you\u2019re 100% certain you know he will hate everything about her appearance and style the day of the wedding. You sound like you\u2019re jealous and that\u2019s just weird. The point is for her to feel beautiful with herself, and it sounds like she does. Also, if he wasn\u2019t attracted to her at all (which is exactly what you\u2019re implying), I highly doubt he would be marrying her. Controlling someone\u2019s appearance is not at all \u201csticking up\u201d for your brother.", "YTA...... its not you or your brothers right to dictate what Mary does with her appearance. I am married and I would never let my husband dictate what kind or makeup or hair color I have. It's not called compromise, it's called being controlled.

He hasn't seen her actual wedding dress (I have) but he knows the general direction of what she'd go for. I've seen the dress and honestly I'm certain my brother will despise it.\n\nSecondly, she's died her hair into a dirty blonde shade and changed her natural hair color which was chocolate brown. My brother adores natural hair and everything natural to be honest so the drastic change she made just a while before the wedding, he's not a fan of it.\n\nThirdly it's the thing that broke the camel's back for me and lead me to speak up about her behavior. She's doing a full glam makeup for the wedding which my brother hates. He prefers a light, natural makeup. The whole thing bothers me because while I understand its her wedding, I think she fails to realise its also my brother's wedding and she doesn't respect any of his opinions regarding this. She just does whatever she pleases and expects my brother to just suck it up as if his opinion on how this wedding will unroll and his opinion on certain choices doesn't matter.\n\nSo couple days ago I addressed this to her and I made sure my brother knows he's on the right and that I'm on his side. So I addressed it while both of them were present and I said that Mary is being really self centered and kind of an AH for not taking into account my brother's opinions and I reminded her how it's also his wedding not just hers.\n\nShe went into full defense mode and said that she values his opinion on general stuff like the decorations or what kind of song they'll dance to but she won't let my brother dictate her appearance and that I should take my unsolicited advice and shove it. My brother barely reacted and when I looked at him to step in her said \"you reap what you sow\" which pretty much means I brought this on myself.\n\nI was just trying to do a nice thing and stick up for my brother just for him to throw me under the bus. Anyone I've told this to has said I acted like an AH and it was not my business to get involved in the first place and I really don't understand this narrative.\n\nCould I really be TA for wanting to defend my brother?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Lol YTA, the best thing for you to do for your brother is convince him not to marry this poor girl so she doesn\u2019t have to experience the nightmare that I imagine being your SIL will be.", "YTA\n\nSIL is right. All you complaints are about things she is doing to her own body/self. Your brother was right also, you gave an opinion nobody asked you for. \n\nYou are gotse all the way on this one.", "YTA and so is your brother. It is the brides day to feel beautiful, it is infact only one day out of a lifetime. You and your brother should be less selfish. After all he is not the one wearing the gown or the makeup. I hope she sees all the red flags that is your family and decides to run for the hills", "YTA and have weird boundaries when it comes to your brother. Back off there, not your wedding, not your problem.", "Yeah, YTA. You're thinking of this as \"defending your brother\", but what you fail to realise is that the bride making choices about what she wants to wear is not an attack on your brother. She isn't doing it against him, and he doesn't need you to defend him. \n\nYou are interfering in something that is purely between your brother and his wife-to-be. No, worse than that - it's not even a wedding decision that they're sharing but a *bride decision* that is hers and hers alone to make. Women get to choose what they wear. End of story. She is not a decoration for your brother's wedding. Her dress, her hair, her make-up - it's her choice not anyone else's.", "YTA.\n\nIf your brother isn't bothered you shouldn't be bothered.\n\nAnd future SIL is right - while he absolutely should have input on the day, his job when it comes to her dress, hair, makeup is to be happy she looks and feels the way she wanted to. It is not up to him - OR YOU!!! - to dictate how she wants to look. \n\nIt also sounds like you've just assumed what you think your brother likes but he doesn't actually have an issue. So you aren't defending him at all. \n\nYou made assumptions and overstepped and you should apologise.", "YTA....your brother doesn't get to control what his bride looks like or how she dresses. Marriage doesn't mean the groom is the boss of the bride. Huge red flags when a man dictates how a women dresses, their makeup and hair color. I dunno why you involved  yourself in the first place.  You basically  just ruined any chance of a relationship  with your SIL.  Also it doesn't seem like your brother  would be as quick to step  up for you as he left  you to reap what you sowed.", "How fucking DARE you! Like the nerve of you is just unbelievable.

The only thing you get to decide is whether or not to act like an asshole and in choosing to do so you made the wrong choice.", "YTA Her appearance is 100% her choice to make.

She will keep disrespecting him with every big decision they make in the future.\n\nEdit: I might get downvoted because \u201cit\u2019s her choice\u201d yeah, but she has to take into consideration how her future husband feels about it. That\u2019s called respect. Something she is already lacking\u2026", "The thing is that be doesn't fight for his opinions to be heard so I stepped up for him. He says he doesn't like x thing about what Mary does to her appearance. He doesn't complain to her but he always vents to me and our parents about how Mary did this and that thing that he hates.

Her appearance for her wedding is for her. Your brother is right to defend his future wife from being attacked for her looks she is making for her own wedding. You're way out of line.

Your brother is an adult, and maybe he complained to you about his preferences, but you had no right to bring it up to the bride.", "You're brother, and you, by extension, sound like a controlling asshole. Everything you mentioned pertains to *her* specifically. Her dress, hair style/color, and makeup are things she can change and no she does not need her fiances permission to do so. If they make her happy then he should put his big boy pants on and be supportive of that. Your title suggests that she was bypassing his input on things like the guest list, or wedding colors, but personal appearance?? Yeah, that's not common ground for a wedding, those are choices that she can make for herself.

Wow, what a huge walking red flag you both are.", "I never had a wedding so it never occurred to me that brides ask their groom opinions on the dresses, I guess I always assumed the groom would like it as there\u2019s a reason they are getting married and grooms already liked their brides and their styles, I just don\u2019t understand what can\u2019t be so wrong in her dress you\u2019re convinced he won\u2019t like it and it\u2019s understandable she wants to wear more make up than normal on her wedding day as it\u2019s a very special day. Mind your own businesses. YTA.", "I keep rereading and the one thing I can\u2019t find is the groom himself saying that he is not a fan of these decisions. I see a whole lot of you dictating what he does and doesn\u2019t like, but nowhere have you said that he has actually voiced any of these feelings. You are inferring, and then were surprised when he didn\u2019t take your side. And you don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH??? \n\nYTA, maybe let your brother fight his own battles instead of guessing about imaginary ones.", "YTA. You do realise that you're the only one being self centred around the wedding right? \n\nYour brother is a grown adult who can manage his own life.

I mean c'mon who does she think she is? Women in relationships don't have free will they have to run every possible change they might make by the man of the house first to get his permission first and she clearly didn't do any of that. She's clearly the AH here not you op. I wish you and your brother a long happy marriage together", "YTA\n\nStop inserting yourself into someone else's relationship.

He will have the all natural look everyday for the rest of his life(be careful what you wish for lol) you almost act like her dress is for him to be turned on by.  This isn't about impressing him(that stage should be over with) and honestly... Is there much he loves about her? He's gonna hate this and hate that and not like this... You and your brother are TAH.

He sounds really insecure and you're just plain rude and nosey", "So let me get this straight, your brother should have a say on her dress, her hair and her makeup?? No complaints about the venue? Menu? Colour and theme? No sounds like all the personal choices for the wedding. To be honest, you and your brother need to get over yourselves. These are her personal choices that are not your brothers choice or any of your business. YTA.", "Are you sure you don\u2019t want to be marrying your brother? All of this sounds super creepy. Your brother should be less concerned about how his bride is going to look on their wedding day. YTA big time.", "YTA as well as your brother. Literally all of the things you listed are solely about her, neither you nor your brother get to decide what she looks like ever.", "YTA. It's her hair/dress/face. She can do to it whatever she wants! Plus if your brother is with her purely because of superficial stuff like her hair dress and make up, he's not a man for her. Way to put your nose where it doesn't belong", "YTA if this was like what to eat or the first dance, sure. But you are literally asking her to change how she wants to look on her own wedding day. It's not up to your brother to tell her what she should look like even if he has a preference. It's also not your battle to fight and none of your business so you really should butt right out.", "YTA. So she values his input into deciding on the venue, the decorations/theme, the song they dance to, etc. Meaning everything about the wedding except what she wears. Did your brother actually complain to you about this stuff or is it shit you made up in your head? Clearly it doesn't seem to bother him enough to actually say something to her. And it's their relationship. Their marriage. It's not your job to get in between. This is the type of stuff they will have to figure out on their own. Stop causing drama. Your brother doesn't need you to make him look like a controlling asshole. This also sets a dangerous precedent for the future. All couple fight at some point, and when they inevitably do, will you be knocking on her door every time to \"stand up for him\"? Let them figure their own stuff out themselves.", "yta. you definitely should\u2019ve sat this one out. it was never your business to get involved with his issues about HIS fianc\u00e9e, especially when they all involve him being judgmental about her looks. he most likely only told you about it just so he wouldn\u2019t have to say it to her. you honestly can\u2019t blame anyone but yourself.", "YTA- he gets zero say in how she dresses and it sounds like you have the issues not him.", "YTA.

It sounds like he straight up doesn\u2019t like her.", "OP, it doesn\u2019t matter what you think your brother hates or not. The bride\u2019s appearance is the BRIDE\u2019S choice, not anybody else\u2019s. Sure, some brides ask their groom\u2019s opinions, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to take them. She is doing what she feels best in and you and brother should respect that. Brother should love her no matter what dress she chooses and makeup she wears. That\u2019s kind of the point of marriage, no? Your brother seems far more accepting of this notion than you.\n\nYTA, and honestly, you sound a bit jealous of her.", "YTA. \nYour future SIL is right. And I hope she cancels because she won\u2019t be happy.\n\nKeep your options to yourself", "Relationships are all about compromise. This isnt it between them.\n\nAlso they're both too childish to actually discuss it between themselves. So don't get attached to her.\n\nYTA for getting involved, even though it'sfrom good intentions. But at the same time, shes TA too. I get a wedding is more the womans day than the mans, but if she wanted to go full on like this.. she needs to have discussed it with him and come to an agreement.\n\nTbh ESH. Fuck it.

So perhaps that's where the other person got that impression from. But I agree it feels semi implied?

But I think it's also just as likely that based on the brothers sort of tacit acceptance of OP's fate when speaking out about it versus defending either op or the bride, that he might have vented a bit in confidence to OP as opposed to open link complaining or even perhaps wanting to bring these concerns to the bride.", "And then the bride's brother can tell him about how all wrong his makeup is.", "OP did but\u2026.
