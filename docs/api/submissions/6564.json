Legally your employer is not allowed to deduct any money from your paycheck unless you have agreed to it in writing, and in your case specifically he\u2019d need approval in writing from your parents/guardians as you are a minor.

Your boss is reaping what he sows by creating an environment where you felt you had to do that so that you wouldn't get punished for something that wasn't even your fault.", "NTA - why are his panties in a twist? Was it his mistake? Absolutely not the asshole, it wasn\u2019t your fault. As the customer I\u2019d have loved it. Don\u2019t sweat this.", "NTA - But a question though.  Why would you be the one paying for the \u201cmessed up\u201d order, when it was the other server\u2019s responsibility to mark it off?", "NTA and please make sure you check employment law to see if it is even legal what your boss is doing!", "NTA - please look for another job and check employment law, you (and other victims) may be able to recover unfair money that has been taken away from you all along.\n\n\nAssuming AUD - Australia, I can't imagine a developed country would allow boss to do such.", "NTA\nWhy should you pay for somebody else's mistake.

Or in other words, a good boss would not dock your pay over that.  I wouldn't work for a place like that if it's the bad boss situation.\n\nAnd that $12 was what $1-3 in actual cost?  I don't think it's anywhere close $12.\n\nI know that you're young as a teenager, but don't get taken advantage of.  You'll wise up with years about what is acceptable or unacceptable labor practices.", "NTA. You were using your initiative with the aim of keeping customers happy so you shouldn't be punished for that kind of mistake.

There are no rules. There are only incentives. If you state a rule out loud, and then punish people for following it, then the real rule is the opposite.

Who are you to disobey the incentives your boss has put in place?\n\nAlso, the cost of the syrup used to make fountain drinks is 1 - 3 cents. The business will be fine.", "NTA.

Your bosses behaviors means they brought this on themselves", "NTA.", "NTA. This was totally not your fault. You did your job correctly, someone else made the mistake of not marking it off the docket. The owner seems like a jerk. He\u2019s creating an negative environment where employees can\u2019t feel safe to make a mistake - and again, you didn\u2019t make a mistake. Your co-worker needs to mind his own business, it has nothing to do with him so why does he care anyway. His behavior is just a product of the negative environment the owner created. I would totally find a different job where the workers are valued and you can feel safe to make mistakes", "NTA, you did the right thing. If anything, your boss ITA for deducting pay for a simple mistake.", "NTA- losing 12 bucks won't harm the caf\u00e9 whatsoever and your co-worker and boss are being incredibly over dramatic.
