Seen a few comments referring to me as she/her, and just wanted to clear that up.\n\nI, (17M) work in a food court. My job is mainly making sandwiches and serving customers, and during non-rush hour times, service gets slow and staff are encouraged to chat with customers, especially if they're waiting for their food. One such customer (about 29M, though he could have been in his early 30s) had ordered a toasted sandwich, and as I waited for it to be ready I made small talk about the holiday season and Christmas plans. He said he had no plans, as he had a small family who were all away, and I offhandedly mentioned that I had a larger family, and so would be doing two separate big Christmases. He then jokingly said he should tag along, and asked what area I was located. I lied, obviously, but he kind of nodded and continued talking to me.\n\nOnce his sandwich was done, I went to wrap it up and pack it up, and saw him writing something on his receipt, which ended up being his phone number. He asked if we could \"exchange numbers\" as he'd \"love to get to know me over christmas\". I was a bit creeped out, and said that would be a bit of a problem as I was still a minor. He then asked me when I'd be turning 18. I vaugely said a few months, and he said that he'd wait for me to turn 18 so I could reconsider his offer. This really creeped me out, so after he'd left I contacted the shopping centre security and requested that they keep an eye on him, just to see if he'd return to the store I worked at on my days off. I also let my boss know, and she promised to keep and eye out for him and try warding him off if he came looking.\n\nOne of my coworkers got wind of this and said I was being too paranoid, saying he was just a lonely guy who probably didn't mean any harm, and that calling security was overkill. I don't see it that way, but now I'm worried I've just upset some lonely guy. AITA?\n\nTLDR: Guy over 10 years older than me asked for my number after some casual conversation and said he'd wait for me to turn 18 after finding out I'm a minor. I notified security, my coworker called me paranoid and overkill.

The absolute *latest* this creep should have backed the hell off is when you said you were a minor.  But he never backed off at all, he basically doubled down.

Until that though I think the interaction was ok. \n\nI\u2019m 30 in April and I still get asked for ID so some people do look older and others look younger.

Sorry that you have an issue understanding that thats the single most creepy thing a grown man or woman can say to a minor.

Absolutely not. Maybe calling security is overkill but when you're a female minor working in one of these low paying jobs people like this can escalate fast.

That tells you a lot about what kind of a person he was, and he\u2019s not a safe one. The fact that your coworker is defending him and not you casts suspicion on *their* behavior as well. What kind of actions could they justify taking if they feel like they\u2019re \u201cjust lonely?\u201d What do they believe they\u2019d be entitled to do in that scenario? You can\u2019t rule out the possibility that they\u2019d behave similarly. \n\nIf this coworker won\u2019t drop it, you might want to take this to your manager as well. You do not deserve to be shamed and harassed for protecting your own safety.", "Someone found you attractive and asked you out.

How many times have horror stories been in the news? Yes, maybe you went a bit overboard, but maybe you did not.\n\nAlso, there are other factors to consider such as, can you walk to/from your car with other people? Is the area well lighted? How much bigger was that guy than you are? \n\nSometimes people are just lonely, but sometimes they can be dangerous also. Frankly, if you described yourself as a young female I bet no one would blink an eye about your concerns.", "NTA you were uncomfortable and acted accordingly. However you should learn to be assertive such as 'I'm not interested and your making me uncomfortable.\nIf he continues ' your being really creepy and predatory'", "NTA\n\nAsk your co-worker if they want to spend time with the guy, since they have some feels about the situation.  I bet they don't want to either.", "NTA at all.\nGeneral rule: never take it as flirting if it comes from someone working at the moment. \nMinor? Back the fuck off inmediately.\nIf a situation makes you uncomfortable, you're in the right and please tell someone you trust.", "NTA only because you said you were 17 and he still was pushing it which goes from weird to full creep terrritory.", "Apologies for mistaking your gender, OP!", "NTA and your coworker is part of the problem. \n\n>said I was being too paranoid, saying he was just a lonely guy who probably didn't mean any harm\n\n\nA lonely guy who means no harm would have stopped after the comment about joining you. On its own, that comment is the equivalent of asking someone to stuff you in their suitcase when they say they're going on vacation.\n\nEverything after that, ESPECIALLY the part about waiting for you to turn 18, turns that comment into something else entirely.\n\nAgain, NTA", "Everything was fine on his part until you told him your age and he continued on. He should have ended it there.
