The property management threatened to evict me due to her not being on my lease, smoking on the property, and too much company. Although I was already annoyed my lease was about to end so until then I had to make a choice either her or us. I told her she had to go and we ended up in a big argument. No one apologized or talked about it. A few weeks went by and next thing I knew my sister was back living with me. \n\nBefore my lease ended I tried to find another place in time and ran out of options.

This year she had another wreck in my new car. All accidents she received insurance money from and she did nothing with the money. She also has a dog that I now take care of because she refuses to care for it.

They are the type of people who live a party lifestyle and she can do whatever she wants. She helps her cousin with her kids, cleans ect. My sister has been talking about me to other family members saying I kicked her out and brags about how she helps her cousin. I texted my sister letting her know I never want to see her again, and she can never come back due to the way she talked about me took advantage of me and made me feel with her lies. I gave her dog to our brother and I packed her remaining things and told her she has 24 hrs to come get her stuff. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten texts and calls from other family members saying I was wrong and it\u2019s not her job to help me with my kids or bills and I should let her live her life because she\u2019s my sister not my child.

I took care of my brother like that for many, many years; doing whatever it took to keep him safe -- I went to jail for him, I let him live with me rent free, I raised his son for 2 years, and it just kept on; because in my mind, it was still us against the world. I was 37 before I hit my limit and broke free.  \n\nOP deserves a little credit for breaking the cycle so early in her adulthood.\n\nAfter all, it was her parents' job to raise her sister; if anyone deserves the heat for being a bad parent, it's them... she did the best she could as a mother to someone only 2 years younger than she was", "I was thinking the same thing but then I remembered that a lot of people likely think I have no backbone when it comes to my son with addiction issues.
