And three years ago my husband (37) and I (32) paid for him and his gf (58?) to come stay with us. His gf turned out to be a nightmare, she had a cold and was just in the worst mood. She made us wait 2.5 hours for her at the hotel, she lost her shit after my husband made a joke, just generally awful. We were walking on eggshells. \n\nAt the end of this stay we had a conversation, and she assured me that everything was hashed out. But after the stay she has refused to answer any of my messages. (Start of Covid I messaged saying I was worried about the entire situation, she texted my sister that they didn't need me and that they were perfectly fine.) \nNow my dad messages me every now and then for money, because since he got sick they can't sustain themselves without his paycheck. (She does art, but will not find a stable job) \n\nI have paid in the past, about 7000 euros in the past few years. But last time I told my dad that I was happy to pay for his medical expenses, but I will no longer be paying for his gf and her two adult kids until she calls me and we have a conversation about this argument. \n\nBut a few days ago my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, and on a call today he asked me for money again. I told him I will only pay after a conversation with his gf. He says she will never agree to that. I said she was free to make that choice, but then she will have to get the money sorted on her own. \n\nI think I'm not asking too much by wanting to not be ignored by the people I pay for. But I feel like an asshole because my dad is in the middle here. And he might not have that long to live. Should I just suck it up? Am I the asshole?\n\n*Edit to add: It's not just my dad's rates and taxes, it's for all four of them. I'm happy to support just my dad, but it doesn't feel right to support his gf and her two adult children while they ignore me.

You should never have paid anything for his girlfriend and her adult children.  \n\nGoing forward, I would suggest that any monies your father needs are to be paid directly to the medical facilities, doctors, etc.  I highly suspect his girlfriend will confiscate all monies you might send otherwise.", "If you\u2019re supporting your dad\u2019s medical care have him come stay with you alone, otherwise gf can take care of him. If not she can swallow her pride and contact you if she cares about him. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve been giving money to her or her kids or why he is letting you. Edit NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are 100% not the asshole for refusing to support the GF and her adult kids. I do wonder if it's possible for you to support your Dad in ways that dodge the GF? Like maybe pay for some of his medical needs (nurse? medicine?) directly without going through the GF.\n\nI mean, 7000 euros is a lot, so it's not like you have abandoned him.", "Just some extra information: my husband and I are both teachers and we don't spend crazy money. So we are fine, but we're not upper-income.", "If you want to help pay for your dad's medical bills, that's fine and you should pay them directly to the doctor/ hospital, etc. However, you have no reason to pay anything for his girlfriend or her kids, whether they talk to you soon or not.  They aren't your responsibility. NTA", "NTA - Stop paying for her adult children... Pay your fathers expenses directly.", "Why do you care at all about the girlfriend?\n\nIf I found out my dad had lung cancer and was likely dying, I would fly out as soon as I could to spend time with him and check on his care. I would also look into the options he has to pay for medical bills - cancer care can end up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on where you live. If he\u2019s unmarried and has no assets, he may be able to get at least some of that cost covered.\n\nIt\u2019s valid to be concerned that his girlfriend might get her hands on any money you send, and to ask to pay any medical bills directly.", "I am going with ESH, insofar as your dad can't really control what his GF does. It isn't his fault that she won't speak to you. \n\nThat being said, the girlfriend sounds difficult to deal with, and you're right that you are not obligated to pay anything for your dad. But holding him hostage like this is terrible. He is responsible for his own financial needs but not helping him because of his GF makes everyone an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I definitely will be paying any of his medical bills directly. Or any other personal expenses (phone plan ect.)", "I wish I could have my dad come stay here, but he would only be allowed a travel visa. And insurance would not cover him, that would cost us an incredible amount. \n\nI've been sending them money because I feel bad that we live a comfortable life here. And he's my dad, I love him.", "Yes, I can pay those personal expenses directly, and I definitely will continue to cover those costs. \n\nAnd I would pay for (part of) their living expenses, if the gf and her adult kids would speak to me about this issue. I do also think that the two kids should be living on their own and paying for their own expenses. The daughter is 30 and the son is 26, but I get that the job market is hard.", "True, maybe I can also just pay for my dad's part of the rates and taxes. There are four of them living there, so 25% of that bill.", "Yes, that seems to be the consensus so far. I just feel bad knowing he is so sick. I might just pay for his share of the rates and taxes, and pay that directly to the source.", "I am more than happy to pay any of his medical costs directly to the hospital. I'll pay for any of his personal expenses. We're waiting on the doctor's appointment next week to make plans to fly out. I'll probably also fly my sister out, she doesn't have enough funds to get a plane ticket. And they are expensive.", "I'm fine with paying just for him, it just doesn't feel right to support his gf and her two adult kids when they won't speak to me. \n\nBut I do also feel like an asshole.", "I understand the insurance issues, I just meant there should be some reciprocity, he should care about your feelings too even if he can\u2019t offer anything monetary. I\u2019m sorry about your dad\u2019s diagnosis.", "It\u2019s your money to do with what you want for sure. No question. I think my hang up is how your dad is being punished specifically for something he didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t change.", "Thank you, his getting sick 2.5 years ago was already rough. But this has just been the worst news to receive.", "Yes, I agree with you! That's why I'm not sure if I should just suck it up and accept that I will have to support all of them or none (apart from medical or other personal expenses).", "Right, I hear you. It sucks for sure. Good luck.", "Thank you, and thanks for your input. I'm trying to get more perspectives, there are just so many emotions right now, that I find it hard to make a good decision.", "INFO: what was the joke your husband made?", "NTA.  but you could always send 1/4 of the total bill - so that your dad's share is covered.  She can figure out the rest.", "NTA. I would never suggest the apology ultimatum because you either won't get it or you'll get lied to with a fake sorry so they get what they want. Just accept that this woman is a nightmare and you won't have a cordial relationship with her. And if you want to help your dad, then do so in a way you can live with. Like paying for his medical care directly, rather than giving him money that he can do whatever with.", "NTA Your dad is in the middle because he want someone to sleep with and doesn't care if she treats you like crap. So what if he is in the middle and suffering for it? His choice. Never ever give him cash. Only direct payments for select debts.", "Your dad is a sucker. Support himself or nothing. No need to talk to that woman. She's not your step mother.", "NTA. They have *four adults* living in the home and they can't afford their bills? Absolutely not. \n\nDon't even make the girlfriend talk to you. She's not worth the effort and it will just bring more drama into your life. Tell your dad that his household can support itself, even with three adults working to cover four people it should be fine. If he needs help with medical bills he can provide you the bill and you'll pay directly. \n\nAfter all, if she doesn't want anything to do with you, she shouldn't want anything to do with your hard earned money either, right?", "Your father was diagnosed with Lung Cancer, but in order to help your father, his gf has to talk to you. Why is it important to talk to her? If I were you, I would refuse to talk to gf. Why is she important in this equation.\nSupport your father as much as you can but not the gf and her children. Come up with a system to do that. And don\u2019t give people more importance than they deserve.  Unless the gf is the Queen of the world!", "Ignoring you or not, WHY are you financially supporting 3 ADULTS?", "My husband went out to get her medication and they gave it to him in a small paper bag. He said that it felt like he was 'doing a drug deal' because of the small bag of pills. \n\nShe was not amused, he apologized.", "I will happily pay his medical bills, or any personal expenses. I paid for his glasses, I've paid some phone bills.", "True, that seems more fair. I might do that.", "Thanks, I would only continue the relationship with her if I truly believed her. And I'm sure I'm not blameless in the conflict, but the only way I know what I did wrong is by communication. \n\nI was truly annoyed with her when she left the phone I got for her with a phone plan in the car. And we could not contact her while she made us wait for 2.5 hours.", "It's hard, but not that hard.  I have a 19 yo who is having a difficult time and taking time off from college.  We said she needed to have a job.  She has had two - the first on didn't work on, now she works front desk at a fitness place.  There is literally NO reason that they can't be working.  Cut off all support now.  They are leeches who think they can treat you horribly.  I'm just sorry you have to deal with this as your father is so sick.", "She sounds very rude and I don't know how you would be to blame for her behavior. Maybe try being more empathetic to yourself rather than her and your dad. He's not blameless for letting his gf treat his daughter this way and doing nothing to stop it. And if he can't, he shouldn't have stayed with her. \n\nI'm sorry you're having to deal with this and I'm sorry about his diagnosis. My mom passed of that years ago (so I know the treatment is much better now). I wish you both the best.", "Glad to hear you'll be able to see your father. Sorry that you're going through this.", "I know, but they live in South-Africa, and I'm having a hard time judging how hard that job market is. But they should at least be trying for different jobs.", "Thank you, this news has been the worst news we could have gotten. I think she's just very bad at someone calling her out for doing something wrong,she just avoids. Same as my dad, I know he is not good at standing up for himself (or me).", "Thanks, and I'll make sure my sister sees him as well. I'm hoping the doctors say we can visit soon, so he's as much of his old self as he can be.", "Is there a reason prior to his cancer why he couldn\u2019t work?  There is no chance on earth i would contribute a drive to his girlfriend or her ADULT kids?  How on earth is that your responsibility?", "No way should you support people who won\u2019t even talk to you.  Who else do you want to support?  My third cousins because they\u2019re lazy?"]}
