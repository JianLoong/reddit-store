And three years ago my husband (37) and I (32) paid for him and his gf (58?) to come stay with us. His gf turned out to be a nightmare, she had a cold and was just in the worst mood. She made us wait 2.5 hours for her at the hotel, she lost her shit after my husband made a joke, just generally awful. We were walking on eggshells. \n\nAt the end of this stay we had a conversation, and she assured me that everything was hashed out. But after the stay she has refused to answer any of my messages. (Start of Covid I messaged saying I was worried about the entire situation, she texted my sister that they didn't need me and that they were perfectly fine.) \nNow my dad messages me every now and then for money, because since he got sick they can't sustain themselves without his paycheck. (She does art, but will not find a stable job) \n\nI have paid in the past, about 7000 euros in the past few years. But last time I told my dad that I was happy to pay for his medical expenses, but I will no longer be paying for his gf and her two adult kids until she calls me and we have a conversation about this argument. \n\nBut a few days ago my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, and on a call today he asked me for money again. I told him I will only pay after a conversation with his gf. He says she will never agree to that. I said she was free to make that choice, but then she will have to get the money sorted on her own. \n\nI think I'm not asking too much by wanting to not be ignored by the people I pay for. But I feel like an asshole because my dad is in the middle here. And he might not have that long to live. Should I just suck it up? Am I the asshole?\n\n*Edit to add: It's not just my dad's rates and taxes, it's for all four of them. I'm happy to support just my dad, but it doesn't feel right to support his gf and her two adult children while they ignore me.

You should never have paid anything for his girlfriend and her adult children.  \n\nGoing forward, I would suggest that any monies your father needs are to be paid directly to the medical facilities, doctors, etc.  I highly suspect his girlfriend will confiscate all monies you might send otherwise.", "If you\u2019re supporting your dad\u2019s medical care have him come stay with you alone, otherwise gf can take care of him. If not she can swallow her pride and contact you if she cares about him. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve been giving money to her or her kids or why he is letting you. Edit NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are 100% not the asshole for refusing to support the GF and her adult kids. I do wonder if it's possible for you to support your Dad in ways that dodge the GF? Like maybe pay for some of his medical needs (nurse? medicine?) directly without going through the GF.\n\nI mean, 7000 euros is a lot, so it's not like you have abandoned him.", "Just some extra information: my husband and I are both teachers and we don't spend crazy money. So we are fine, but we're not upper-income.", "If you want to help pay for your dad's medical bills, that's fine and you should pay them directly to the doctor/ hospital, etc. However, you have no reason to pay anything for his girlfriend or her kids, whether they talk to you soon or not.  They aren't your responsibility. NTA", "NTA - Stop paying for her adult children... Pay your fathers expenses directly.", "Why do you care at all about the girlfriend?\n\nIf I found out my dad had lung cancer and was likely dying, I would fly out as soon as I could to spend time with him and check on his care. I would also look into the options he has to pay for medical bills - cancer care can end up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on where you live. If he\u2019s unmarried and has no assets, he may be able to get at least some of that cost covered.\n\nIt\u2019s valid to be concerned that his girlfriend might get her hands on any money you send, and to ask to pay any medical bills directly.", "I am going with ESH, insofar as your dad can't really control what his GF does. It isn't his fault that she won't speak to you. \n\nThat being said, the girlfriend sounds difficult to deal with, and you're right that you are not obligated to pay anything for your dad. But holding him hostage like this is terrible. He is responsible for his own financial needs but not helping him because of his GF makes everyone an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I definitely will be paying any of his medical bills directly. Or any other personal expenses (phone plan ect.)", "I wish I could have my dad come stay here, but he would only be allowed a travel visa. And insurance would not cover him, that would cost us an incredible amount. \n\nI've been sending them money because I feel bad that we live a comfortable life here. And he's my dad, I love him.", "Yes, I can pay those personal expenses directly, and I definitely will continue to cover those costs. \n\nAnd I would pay for (part of) their living expenses, if the gf and her adult kids would speak to me about this issue. I do also think that the two kids should be living on their own and paying for their own expenses.

There are four of them living there, so 25% of that bill.", "Yes, that seems to be the consensus so far. I just feel bad knowing he is so sick. I might just pay for his share of the rates and taxes, and pay that directly to the source.", "I am more than happy to pay any of his medical costs directly to the hospital. I'll pay for any of his personal expenses. We're waiting on the doctor's appointment next week to make plans to fly out.
