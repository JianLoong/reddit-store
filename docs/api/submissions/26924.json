Tampons and pads (single use menstrual products) create TONS of waste and are extremely expensive, especially if you have a heavy flow. Menstrual cups are environmentally and economically friendly, as the other commenter mentioned. They\u2019re not to everyone\u2019s taste, but comparing it to reusing toilet paper is just\u2026 inaccurate.", "It\u2019s actually way more comfortable to use than tampons and pads! Less risk of TSS compared to tampons, and more sanitary than pads! It sounds weird at first, but I can confirm they\u2019re actually AMAZING! When they\u2019re not left dirty on a counter; that\u2019s disgusting! All wife has to do is rinse it out and then sanitize it later; it\u2019s silicone so it washes off super easily. Leaving blood on it is super lazy.", "You would feel very differently if you ever had a period. It\u2019s like before having a baby people are all grossed out by vomit, pee and poop. But after having a baby they often become desensitized to it. Same with period blood. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to use a cup instead of tampons or pads. I made the switch for environmental reasons, but am so glad i did because it\u2019s way more convenient. \n\nThings should not be single use if at all possible to avoid it. It\u2019s one of the ways we\u2019re killing our planet", "If I can reinsert a dick (which typically does not get sanitized in boiling water) into my vagina over and over and over again indefinitely, no reason I can\u2019t do the same with a menstrual cup. At least that gets thoroughly cleaned with soap AT MINIMUM, which is likely more than I can say for many dicks. Unless you\u2019re OP\u2019s wife, that is.", "It's made of silicone, and generally they have to be fitted to work properly. Silicone is safe for so many reuses. \n\nThe biggest issue is women forgetting about them inside them for days or weeks, and getting toxic shock.", "Oh 100% should be cleaned immediately. They\u2019re quite disgusting (I use a disc myself). \n\nBut don\u2019t totally dismiss them! They can be quite nice \u2014 you don\u2019t ever have any bloody tampons or pads stinking up the trash if they\u2019re used properly! You\u2019d never notice your partner using them.  \ud83d\ude06", "Sex education in the U.S. is appalling. Leaving it up to the parents creates swathes of ignorance. I\u2019ll admit though, I didn\u2019t know about them until I was in Walgreens buying some tampons when I saw a few cups on the shelf.", "TBF, I try to keep up on period products, even though I\u2019m a gay man I volunteer with homeless folks and period products are one area of concern for homeless people who menstruate. Some of my googling for information has resulted in useless pages of porn, so I started just asking women.", "It\u2019s a real crime \ud83d\ude05", "My husband will put dirty dishes on the counter. Then will say things like \"At least I don't leave dishes in the sink\" um... they are not in the dishwasher. The counter is not the better option.", "Bless you hun x .. see its that easy to help someone you love .. tiny action big reward", "In our house, the garbage disposal is in the right hand sink, dirty dishes left there have a tendency to fall into it. \n\nI\u2019m constantly reminding my husband to put dirty dishes in the left side sink so that this doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nYou have no idea how many measuring spoons I have that are bent and scratched. \ud83e\udee4", "This happens to me too! Thank you for caring.", "It's something like this that doesn't logically make sense that I'd have a hard time conceding to tbh I respect that you do it but for me it would be hella difficult.", "Definitely. My ex also wouldn\u2019t do his own laundry, pay his own bills, make his own appointments. I begged him to step it up so many times. When I finally ended it and repeated all this to him, his response was, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was that important to you.\u201d I was dumbfounded.", "No one is forgetting their cup inside of them for days! They also don\u2019t need fitted; they do come in a variety of sizes but they\u2019re not like an old school contraceptive diaphragm.", "what is it with men and not putting their shit in the dishwasher? my boyfriend goes \"I might need it later!\"\n\na) you do the fuck not and \n\nb) you can take it out of the dishwasher if you actually need it again", "Its a better option than the sink which would take up space and make it harder to use", "Is there not a switch to turn the disposal off?", "He likes the side with the garbage disposal open \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Not just men. My wife will not put stuff in the dishwasher. Drives me insane. Like it's right there under the counter you've just put that dirty knife on. Now the counter's dirty and the knife's not in the dishwasher!", "Another poster mentioned it isnt just men, theyre right.\n\nIts me. Lol\n\nDishes were a huge point of contention for myself and my partner for years. We used to switch off who loaded and unloaded - so if it was \"my turn\" Id unload clean dishes and put in dirty ones before running it. That mever worked and just caused friction.\n\nUntil I had a brainwave. I dont like *unloading*, which was stopping me from doing my portion of the task. So, we switched it up. He unloads, I load. Dirty dishes go in the sink, then when the washer is empty I load it. Repeat.\n\nIts been 4 years of this system and it goes so much more smoothly!\n\nI have no idea why I prefer loading to unloading. Literally none. But I find it much easier to load dirty dishes in. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMy point is, sometimes you need to try another way. And sometimes one person is just being a pain. (It was me, pre switch up, I was *absolutely* the pain point in the dishes issue in our house. Lol)", "I'd not be sexist in that way, I'm a man, and I hand-wash all the dishes and put them in the dish drawer for drying, so its not a men thing as much as it is a laziness thing.", "That makes sense to me", "I irritate myself with my inability to just it things in the dishwasher but I\u2019ve been conditioned not to. Grew up in a family of 7 with a mom who had a very particular way she wanted everything loaded and would \u201cplayfully\u201d harp on how you did it wrong but it was the weirdest reasons we couldn\u2019t get them right lol", "Unless it\u2019s a butter knife or table knife, it doesn\u2019t belong in the dishwasher.  That aside, generally dirty dishes belong in the sink or dishwasher.  I would hand wash the knife immediately if it can\u2019t go in the dishwasher.", "Would just like to add it might be an ADHD thing because I'm feeling bad about myself and mildly defensive \ud83d\ude2d", "I sent a meme to my partner that said something like \"In every relationship, there's one partner who packs the dishwasher like a Swedish architect and one who packs it like a meth-addled raccoon\" and told him he was the raccoon.  Since then he has thankfully left the poor dishwasher alone.  It didn't deserve the things he was doing to it.\n\nAnd no, it's not weaponised incompetence - he's better at maintaining a household than I am and does his fair share of housework without having to be nagged or complaining.", "I joke with my Dad we had a dishwasher, named ME! Gosh, he would get mad when I'd run to do dishes on commercial breaks......"]}
