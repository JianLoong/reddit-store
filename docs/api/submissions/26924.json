In a loving and healthy relationship, going to a bit of extra effort to ease a problem for your partner is, like, normal.", ">well what am supposed to do with it when im in a hurry?\n\nAnd what does she say after you point out it's been there three days?", "Ok serious question I\u2019m not trolling cause I\u2019ve been with quite a few Women in my life, and not one of them has collected their menstrual fluids in a Cup to keep.\n\nSo wtf is a Menstrual cup, and why would you guys collect your Menstrual fluids in a cup at all? What\u2019s the purpose?", "Bad idea. Juding by how she is now, she will probably just bleed all over the house and leave red snail trails all over the furniture.....", "That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d do in ops situation", "Unfortunately", "[removed]", "This is so unsanitary that any reasonable person would be upset even in the absence of ptsd", "I was born with genetic hermaphroditism and do not have a Menstruation cycle. This part part of why I was afraid I was crossing a boundary as I have not had to personally deal with all of that.", "I disagree with them being TA for not wanting someone's uterine lining to have been in something they use to cook food. Just because it's sanitary doesn't mean it's not gross.", "I\u2019m curious of what behavior you think I should change? Like.. Me establishing a boundary of this is not ok to me and reminding her every time that happens seems reasonable imo.", "Even if she did this and had a tupperware closed and on the counter, it'd be much better than what she's doing. This might be a good compromise for them.", "Ahhhhh nooo! My keyboard in in German, sometimes the autocorrect gets weird \ud83d\ude05", "Unexceptionable is a word. But it means the exact opposite of what OP (probably) intended. It's a somewhat older word, and it means something that is acceptable.", "Blood talk can disturb some.", "Not diagnosed but in my (university educated biochem/ psychology) opinion yes she displays signs of ADHD. This has been the most challenging part for me because I understand the challenges that posses but nonetheless it\u2019s one of those things that\u2026 it\u2019s just damn\u2026 She goes above and beyond in school, work, and for other people.. so I would expect at least a little effort on something like this even if there was the challenge of ADHD. \n\nBut I have a skewed opinion on this because I have ADHD and group up in an abusive household that did not allow much leeway for it.(not that I\u2019m abusive about it by any stretch of the imagination. Just learned to take care of my responsibilities.)", "Bloody.. Typically on a baby wipe or toilet paper though the residual blood is like a half tablespoon to tablespoon and soaks through.", "You aren\u2019t overreacting to your partner\u2019s blatant lack of respect, empathy or responsibility", "If you've got reasons worse than this, then it seems you have very good reasons... I can imagine a person who doesn't have respect for this matter will also not have it for many many others.", "That doesn\u2019t surprise.  Leaving her cup used on the counter like that for days and not understanding the problem with it is just so dysfunctional.  This can\u2019t be the only problem she has if she\u2019s that oblivious to hygiene and common curtesies", "Throw it, and her, away. NTA.", "If you\u2019re already considering divorce or have before then it can\u2019t hurt to try and be super petty to get the point across. Go to the bathroom and never flush cause you\u2019re in a rush, leaves dishes uncleaned, leave clothes on the floor lol \n\nThis is terrible advice but also some people need extremes to learn the hard way", "You have combat PTSD. Honestly, not being mindful of that is a red flag so big, the Chinese are asking why your house can be seen from space!", "Exactly, the real issue is the wife's unwillingness to compromise at all. No effort, no empathy, no care.", "How long does it take to rinse something? 15 seconds? 20? What is going on that her schedule is so incredibly tight that there isn't 20 seconds worth of wiggle room in it, on a regular basis?\n\nIt sounds more like wife is just incredibly lazy and disgusting", "Are you a girl or boy??\nWhat's your age??", "Yes I agree but in this case it's cruel on top of being unsanitary because OP suffers from that condition. It just adds distress on top of being gross", "Ever try humor? Banging your head against a stonewall isn't working.", "Lol I'm glad you saw the humour in that, I was just trying to be funny :) Cheers :)", "Fuck me... you're right! Ha! I'd award you if I could lol.... Here, have some theoretical silver! \\*Gives silver\\*", "It's also just plain o gross \ud83e\udd2e like fak lol", "Well yes of course but you \u201cwould have leaned the other way\u201d your own words, if OP didn\u2019t have PTSD. I mean \u201cthe other way\u201d in this forum would be that OP was AH . I\u2019m saying that in ANY context the wife of the AH and not OP", "Hehehe thanks \ud83d\ude04", "Yeah I agree. I don't know why I didn't think about that part before, I guess I must have had a brain fart lol. Thank you for pointing it out."]}
