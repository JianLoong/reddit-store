{"id": 4551, "submission_id": "zjt0tc", "title": "AITA for letting my cat watch me shower?", "selftext": "This feels so ridiculous. Added the NSFW tag just in case, for some odd insinuations by my bf.\n\nI (nb 27) recently had my bf (m25) move in with me. He's from a very city family and I'm very country. He's never had pets before, whereas I have several animals - most importantly for this story, my cat Pokey.\n\nPokey was a stray who I took in when he was under a year old. He was very nervous and aggressive initially. I took him to get neutered and all his shots etc., and with a lot of gentle care and trust-building, he's... well, he'll never be the cuddliest cat. But he loves to sit on my lap and get his head scratched for a few minutes before he gets jumpy and bitey, and the rest of the time he really likes to be close to me and watching me and what I'm doing in that cute/creepy way cats do! He's very vocal, and if he's ever shut out of a room he'll cry. So, rather than having him cry outside out my bathroom every time I shower, I just let him come into the bathroom.\n\nMy bf says this is weird and unhealthy, because I'm letting a cat stare at me naked.\n\nI think he's being ridiculous because... Pokey is a cat. He doesn't care what I'm wearing or not wearing. It's not like this is some voyeuristic thing for me! It's just easier for everyone if he just sits on my clothes and keeps them warm for me while I'm showering, rather than making a fuss outside.\n\nMy bf is also upset that I call Pokey 'my little man' and 'my baby boy' and smooch his little head whenever he's feeling cuddly. I admit I call my bf 'baby boy' too, which my bf loves - it's a cute thing between us - but he's really not happy about me using it on the cat, even though the cat's been 'baby boy' longer than he has...\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I know a relationship is about compromise - and I have compromised quite a lot since we moved in together. I cook stuff my bf likes as he's a lot pickier than me, and I vacuum a lot more because he thinks the house is 'dirty' if he sees even one cat hair on furniture, etc. But I refuse to shut Pokey out of the bathroom when I'm showering and I won't stop calling him petnames and giving him tiny head-kisses.\n\nI've tried talking to my bf and have explained that as he's never lived with an animal before, he doesn't really understand what it's like. I've explained that it makes me seriously uncomfortable that he's insinuating that I have some sort of bestiality thing going on with my cat. He says HE'S seriously uncomfortable with how close and affectionate I am with Pokey, and that I would be the AH if I keep 'treating the cat like he's on equal footing with my boyfriend'.\n\nAITA for still letting Pokey watch me shower?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: sorry, should've mentioned! I have plenty of petnames for my bf that I don't give to the cat, i.e. 'handsome' and 'hotstuff' are only reserved for him!

I have a dog and she not only watches me shower, but sees me getting dressed. You aren't having sexual relations with your cat. They are a cat. A cat. The high level of devotion and affection I have for my dog does not  mean anything sexual, nor does yours with your cat. The situation is bananas.", "Oh the pets DO care but have a different way of showing it. It\u2019s not weird at all. \n\nGo watch some YouTube videos and it\u2019s all over there. That said I did buy a book about it, but can\u2019t seem to find it when we moved homes. I did find it weird at first, hahaha", "Pokey is my boy Morts twin. He passed last year but I could have written your description 100% about him. It's really not weird. Well except in that weird way cat's are anyway.", "This isn\u2019t weird at all! My two cats will chew up the carpet outside the bathroom if I lock them out. So they watch me use the toilet and sometimes watch me shower. It\u2019s for their comfort, not mine, they just want to be in the same room as me. Also I\u2019d hate to see how your bf would react if you had a cat that *was* super cuddly. You give pets affection, if they want it. That\u2019s part of having a pet. Your bf is the weirdo for not understanding that. So this *plus* he\u2019s picky about food and the amount of vacuuming and *you\u2019re* the only one expected to change? Why can\u2019t he pick up a vacuum sometimes or cook for both of you on occasion? He knew you had a cat, but he\u2019s expecting you to make all these changes while he sits around and tells you what to change? Like I get if you move in with someone you compromise, but it comes across like he thinks he\u2019s compromising because he\u2019s \u201cletting\u201d you keep the cat, which isn\u2019t a compromise at all because he knew you had a cat, you and the cat are a package deal and if he\u2019s not okay living with a pet, he needs to find a gf without one. I\u2019m picking up major controlling and lack of empathy vibes from this guy, he better have some freakishly amazing qualities to even begin to make up for how exhausting he sounds in this post.", "Happens to the best of us. \nEven tho he is good guy, everything comes in package. You and your relationship with your pets. Him and his jelousy (along with other things).\nTake care!", "Sometimes people's true colours start to come out when they move in with their partner or at other relationship milestones. Maybe you guys moved in too quickly, or maybe something like this was going to happen whenever he did move it. \n\nBe careful. When someone starts to get jealous or controlling after a relationship milestone, it can be a signal the person is abusive.", "I just did it because the bathroom's one of the only room with tiles in it, and uh, kitty litter can be a nightmare to clean out of the carpet, but yeah, Sarah's happy with it. I can't complain, I'm not that insecure.", "Aww! Good Pokey!", "I call her the lifeguard, because she cannot fathom why is want to actually voluntarily sit in a tub of water, so whenever I have a bath she has to stand guard. I have the cutest photos of her concerned face sitting on the edge of the bath."]}
