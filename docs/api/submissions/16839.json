Minimum two a day. Toodles!", " I would find someone to photoshop you into the most expensive", "OP, r/photoshoprequest is always willing to help lol", "This is the way", "Agreed! If she shows it, it will somehow be too similar, if she doesn\u2019t show it, she\u2019s giving this girl anxiety. They don\u2019t want OP to win. \n\nShe actually needs to stop discussing the weddings with them at all.\n\nAnything she does will be somehow copying or ruining the other wedding, so if she doesn\u2019t know about it at all, they can at least keep the nonsense to themselves .", "Nta, also what does NOHB mean?", "Why? They won\u2019t stop asking her about every little detail. If you give a mouse a cookie\u2026\u2026 They are being AH cuz Op said no multiple times already", "Bruh, OP needs to at least attempt to be serious. The hot dog dress at least needs a skirt a veil.", "Ha ha\u2026I\u2019m reading this in my kid\u2019s piano class and did a big guffaw laugh.  Uh oh!  Stink eye from kid.", "I honestly just clicked into this, and totally forgot what the post was about\ud83d\ude02\n\nI had to come back and read the first comment again lol", "Ahhh, ty. I needed that \ud83d\ude0a", "OP should find a baroque wedding dress. Perhaps something that Marie Antoinette might have worn before the French Revolution.\n\nhttps://www.silverpetticoatreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Marie-Antoinette-wedding.jpg\n\nThen watch Jane sweat like a runner in the Alabamisssippi summer heat while wearing a cumbersome and overelaborate dress on her wedding day.", "I\u2019m honestly speechless that you took the time to write all this. I\u2019m even more impressed I managed to read it all without choking on my Ramen!", "So...when does the movie come out?", "FFS, I'd just roll my eyes in an exasperated way and say something like \"for fuck's sake, Jane, your constant one-upmanship is extremely annoying. weddings aren't a competition, and no one is stealing your damned dress. what are you? 13?\" \n\nNTA", "I\u2019d attend almost any event that was steampunk and Flintstones themed. I\u2019d love to see that mashup.", "I like this approach the best!", "This! \ud83d\udc46", "None Of Her Business :D", "You made me spit my Diet Coke across the room. Well done!", "This runs the risk of looking cool as fuck though. My MIL was married in a custom Georgian gown and the pictures are stunning to this day, totally dodged the 80s wedding aesthetic.", "What\u2019s that? You want to hear about the dress she\u2019s wearing to the premier?", "This is the way.", "I'm sad it's not for sale /s", "Of course. It would be a DISASTER if it bore any resemblance to the dress I might or might not wear."]}
