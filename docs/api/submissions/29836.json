I thought it would be obvious that there is a lot of detail missing from this story, as it\u2019s a 2 paragraph AITA post, and I of course had to filter down and be succinct. Some additional context to address some of the wild accusations: nobody is hoarding, my parents want to see us and my children and we want to see them, my parents are envious that my in-laws get to do a lot more of the childcare, and my step dad is taking immunotherapy shots (about a year in). The main question was to really revolve around the idea that when they ask us to accommodate some how, we do it, and then there is an additional ask that comes up the next time we see them. When we accommodate that additional ask, another one eventually follows. It is perpetual and never ending. Hence the question, \u201cAITA if I stop humouring their requests?\u201d\n\n\nMy step dad has been around for 20 years. We\u2019ve always known he had dog allergies but it\u2019s never been an issue. Within the last 3 years it\u2019s become the focus of every conversation though; it is THE issue in our family. I grew up with a dog at my other parent\u2019s home and when I moved out on my own got a dog of my own. My sibling also owns a dog. It was never an issue; we lived with him for a period of time, we would go for weekly dinners once we moved out, we\u2019d drop the grandkids off for a day with the grandparents, etc. \n\nWhen the pandemic happened suddenly there was this massive anxiety around my step father\u2019s lung health and allergies. We stopped being invited for dinner, if we did get invited we were asked to shower and wear fresh clothes, they stopped watching the grandkids, we stopped doing holidays/celebrations in their home, and it\u2019s now gotten to a point where they insist it\u2019s better for them to come to our dog filled home for a visit than it is for us to track dog dander into their environment. It feels like every time I concede to a request the goal post is moved and there\u2019s another demand\u2026 and it\u2019s starting to feel like my step fathers healthcare is my problem to solve. If I don\u2019t concede and humour their requests it means I don\u2019t see my family and my kids don\u2019t see their grandparents.\n\nThe most recent ask was that we celebrate a family birthday at a rental location instead of their home. We haven\u2019t been in their home since Nov 2022. It just seems so ridiculous to me, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m trivializing his allergies or if they could seriously have become so suddenly severe that this is our new reality.\n\nAITA if I stop humouring their requests and the end result is a more distant relationship?", "created_utc": 1698494215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ic7ob/aita_for_not_making_concessions_for_a_family/", "score": 850, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't really get to gauge the seriousness or validity of someone else's physical or mental health, especially someone much older than you.

Your body is dealing with reacting to the allergens, which means it\u2019s not on it\u2019s A game for other stuff. My extended family had dogs and I can\u2019t tell you the number of holidays and parties that I had a reaction that left me sick and miserable. I\u2019ve had my eyeballs swell out of my face, my lips swell and crack, rashes over such large sections of my body that the individual hives melted together and became huge intolerable itchy areas, and asthma attacks where o was exhausted from breathing. And it sucked. It felt like my family didn\u2019t care that I got so sick. As an adult it still sucks. I tried allergy shots, I\u2019m long past the age I might grow out of it, and I\u2019m on daily allergy meds. I still get reactions from minimal contact with things I\u2019m allergic to. And as we get older, some illnesses suck harder. I got strep last year in my 40s. Felt like I got hit with a truck. It was worse than Covid. I had rashes for weeks because my immune system was a hot mess, and my asthma took 6 months to get under control. \n\nI\u2019m allergic to dog fur, dander and saliva.

I am a lot more sensitive to dust after the pandemic. Your stepfather can have changed in terms of allergies, but also overall health.

Antihistamines, injections, steroids, inhalers... you name it. None of it works. They have to find a certificated pet-free rental nearby any time they want to visit, and she still has to load up on meds for the few hours they visit per day.

It's possible that they're still just looking for a good solution and while that feels to you like they're constantly moving goal posts, I'm quite sure that's not their intention.\n\nIn terms of advice, the only thing I can think is maybe to keep some clean vac-packed clothes somewhere that you can change into before going to theirs. Or if they can visit you from time to time, perhaps have a room in your house that the dogs don't go into and put air purifiers with hepa filters in there.

There are multiple toilets, lots of space for small kids to run, it isn\u2019t crammed, and everyone brings something for a potluck so no one is stuck with the expense and work of hosting. That can work really nicely for large family gatherings. \n\nFor smaller things just your unit and your parents? Meeting up in public to do things with the kids is great. They\u2019ll have a lot more memories of being places with their grandparents. It doesn\u2019t even have to cost money, lots of public spaces are free. \n\nYou can make it work relatively easily if you stop protesting and start working with your parents.", "Sounds like he\u2019s making his allergy his main personality trait and using it to control everything.", "Maybe they don't want your kids in their house, is that a possibility?", "YTA. It sounds like THEY are the ones who are accommodating YOU, and you are dismissing his health issues and acting like you know better than he does about his own allergies. You sound like the type of person who gaslights people about the pain they're in because you've privately decided they're being melodramatic. Let me guess, you've \"been through worse\" and \"didn't complain about it\"", "YTA OP.  I know it's an inconvenience that you and your family are no longer welcomed at their house but you have to understand that your stepfather is now older and his body is no longer able to tolerate what he tolerated before.  And your parents aren't making his health problems your problem to solve, they are **trying** to come up with solutions so that they can still be active with you and your family while protecting your stepfather from severe allergy attacks.  And yes it may be easier for them to visit you because like other's said, once they get home, they may strip out of their clothing in the garage or right inside the door and place clothing inside of a trash bag until your Mom can wash them and jump in the shower right away so as to not spread any dander or whatever is affecting your stepfather inside of their house.  And the same goes for not having you and your family visit them; they have to worry about you all bringing into their house whatever is affecting him.\n\nYou have no idea how hard it is when you have allergies, COVID long effects, COPD, Emphysema, Asthma or any condition that affects the lungs.  The struggles of just trying to breathe and the mental anguish of trying to live a normal life while not trying to affect others lives because of your illness.  Believe you me, it bothers them as much as it bothers you.  I am lucky that my kids/grandkids, Mom, Brother/SIL and most of my family and friends understand.  I guess their understanding comes from hearing me coughing uncontrollably during phone conversations as I try to catch my breath.  But it bothers me that at 60, I am not able to participate with a lot of activities with said family and friends.  And it bothers me that knowing the older I get, my body isn't able to tolerate and recover as I used to be able to do.  Yes, I am receiving treatment and therapy exercises for my lungs because my lung doctor is trying to keep me off of oxygen for as long as she can.", "NAH\n\nFor perspective, the severity of allergies absolutely shifts, in and of itself, over time. (You can develop allergies, and you can find that they resolve. My sister found unexpectedly one day that she had a hospital-level reaction to something we all have a mild sensitivity to, but have always enjoyed in moderation. She now carries an epipen. Overnight.)\n\nBut also, it sounds like what you've said is that your stepfather has complex health problems including issues with his lungs. Those are more recent, or they are worsening. \nAnd allergies don't exist in a body in a vacuum.... The inflammation they trigger contributes to making asthma worse (for instance) and having trouble breathing will of course make any congestion and inflammation from allergies more impactful. (Double whammy \"hard to breathe\").\n\nSo for all of these reasons, yes, it's entirely within reason that their level of protectiveness and care over his health may have shifted.\n\nIt's also possible that the pandemic was the first time he'd had a stretch of time WITHOUT exposure to dander, and it was the first time he could actually see what level of symptoms it triggers. (Sometimes if we are fine in one space or circumstance, but not another, it makes clear what we are reacting to.) \n\nAll of that said, it is perfectly reasonable to want a finish line. (I suspect he wants one, too. Bodies don't come with instruction manuals, we have to figure out our limits through trial and error.)\n\nIt's actually reasonable for them to ask you to change into fresh clothes before going over. Or to meet in a separate space. They aren't asking you to all get rid of your dogs, just to help them figure out how to safely be connected family AND not make Poppa sick. My guess is the moving benchmark is frustrating them as much as you, when they try solution B and it *still isn't enough* so they brainstorm the next one.\n\nFor now, go have meals in a restaurant. Change clothes RIGHT before you go so everyone can hug!\nAnd then strategize what works for all of you. Ask how your SD felt after that meal, and see if that was enough... Then take it from there.\n\nMaybe your parents can keep a set of \"safe\" clothes for the kids at their house, and when the kids come for a visit, they change in the entryway! \n\nOr if they are an age that enjoys them, they might go straight for a bath with bubbles and grandparent toys, and then into grandparent house jammies. \n\nBe willing to be creative. They WANT to stay connected, and reasonably, they also want SD not to get sick every time he hugs the babies he loves.", "NTA. There is  the possibility that your stepdad's lung health has declined over the past few years and they keep a spotless home. I have a friend who has serious lung issues with asthma and COPD (never smoked a cigarette). It could be they just don't want to risk him getting that one infection or reaction that will end his life. It sounds like it could be an actual serious health issue. While NTA I do think you should try to be more understanding. However, since it's his medical issue, he should be the one responsible for the rental fee.", "NTA for not making concessions however I don\u2019t think this is really about the dog allergy. Maybe they really don\u2019t want the responsibility of toddler proofing their home. Cleaning up before and after having messing kids over takes a toll on older adults & hosting is a lot of work. All toddlers are messy. By using a rental the clean up & responsibilities for your kids falls on you instead of them.  Offer to host at your home if you don\u2019t want to pack up for a rental.

They are convinced kids are walking talking buckets of germ (which they sometimes are- I teach Kindergarten so I\u2019m realistic!) but my kids are not little anymore- they are 15, 14 and 11. They are old enough to tell us when they aren\u2019t feeling well, cover their coughs, wash their hands, avoid people when sick, etc. This has become so bad that my 11 year old coughed at last Thanksgiving ONCE (she later told me she ate too much cornbread and was out of water so she had dry cornbread in her throat and that made her cough) and my in laws left. Mid-dinner, just left. They also insist on everyone taking a Covid test before we get together even if we are all healthy and feeling well. They need to SEE these test results via text picture bc apparently they don\u2019t think we would cancel if someone tested positive. It\u2019s like a weird older generation paranoia.

I know it's frustrating, but this is a health condition.\n\nI have asthma and allergies. When COVID first started, I did not realize how much I was exposed to allergens, until I was home and not exposed to them all the time. I felt amazing, like an entirely new person. The amount I could function was unreal. When the world started to open back up, is when I started to run into issues. I kept masking, but my family members, like you kept feeling I was being annoying and just \"moving the goal post\" when I had to keep up with the ever changing data from the CDC and information from my doctors to keep myself safe. It is heart breaking to relay this information to family members and instead of the responses being that of support, getting responses of frustration, anger, annoyance and being treated like we are doing this maliciously. \n\nYour step father probably was exposed to a certain amount of dog allergen on a daily basis before COVID, and then was not exposed at all during. Which is why now the allergy is so much worse. Just show some compassion and empathy, and be supportive, follow their request, it's just for a day or a few hours whatever it may be.

Never had lung issues before and now anything makes them feel inflamed overall and stabbing pain at the worst.  It's really kind of horrible. I was complaining to my husband yesterday that it must be so nice to go through life without allergies. No need to pick apart your food, being able to work in the yard on a wet day without suffering afterward.

I also have dog allergies (though not as severe as your step dad\u2019s!), and it\u2019s a huge PITA. I think the issue is that, if he goes to your place, it\u2019s pretty straightforward for him (and your mother, presumably) to remove any stray dander on their bodies and clothes when they return home than it would be for them to deep-clean their whole house to get rid of what you and your family might have unknowingly tracked in. Allergies can absolutely change and get more severe over time (my grandmother developed a severe, anaphylaxis-inducing allergy to nuts in her 60s), so it\u2019s possible that your step dad has noticed that his have become worse recently and doesn\u2019t want to risk it.

Also, if you listen to older people's conversations they can revolve around who has recently died, whose health condition has got worse, and the current status of their own medical conditions. My mother texts on an almost daily basis with reports on her hearing/arthritis/coughing etc. She seems to want the attention and sympathy you get from being ill, but it can wear very thin. \n\nSo whilst it seems personal it is a symptom of getting old, less healthy and becoming more inward focussed.

It was horrible.", "I don't see how you can diagnose someone who is on immunosuppressive drugs as likely having OCD. Doctors don't subscribe immunosuppressive unless they have clearly identified a medical reason. Stop being an armchair psychologist.", ">\u201cCelebrate your kids bday at a rental?\u201d \u201cNope!\u201d\n\nThe request was to be at a rental instead of **their** home. OP does not get to say \"nope!\" to the celebration not being at their parents home.", "I feel so bad because my little would love all the creatures. We have stuck to fish or lizards so far but they have fluffy friends they can visit.", "Cucumber and melon together actually makes sense. They're INCREDIBLY closely related", "Imagine how hard it is for an elderly man struggling with his health.  He probably already feels bad about having to make accommodations and inconveniencing people, and with your obvious disdain, it probably makes him feel even worse.\n\nPerhaps you don't appreciate the gravity of his health concerns?  Allergies can literally kill you.  At 70, a mild allergic reaction can seriously be a death sentence.  Of course he doesn't want to take that risk.  And you're upset because you have to use plastic utensils?  Get some perspective.\n\nYTA.", "Well you need to  learn to associate the significance of their home space as being somewhere that isn't for you to go. Stop asking about it. Stop even considering it an option. As far as you are concerned it doesn't exist, it is just for them.", "Then maybe pay and suggest for a third place that does work for you? You seem very resolute on putting in zero effort into this relationship, or maybe you have just been catered to so much that you fail to see that you are an adult and as such, are also responsible for making this relationship work.", "So I'm allergic to peanuts, peanuts are not allowed in my house. No one is to bring them there because my house isn't contaminated so I can live freely there without worry and having to clean everywhere after someone leaves to remove any chance of me coming in contact with them. But I can go to someone's home with them. That's their space and that's a risk I'm willing to take.", "Sometimes when the exposure is big that can happen even in minor allergies. I travel with a full arsenal of drugs now for the asthma including a car nebulizer", "When did I diagnose? I wrote \u201cthis sounds like contamination OCD.\u201d Where is the diagnosis? If you\u2019re sneezing with a snotty nose, someone might say \u201csounds like you have a cold.\u201d Not what I would consider \u201cdiagnosing someone.\u201d", "In the long run, it is also tough on families if you refuse to be around an active alcoholic in the midst of their disease. That doesn\u2019t mean that you enable. \n\nI\u2019ve been there done that too. I gave into the OCD of a family member for a long time but realized it wasn\u2019t my issue to solve (not could I solve it).", "Yeah those do make sense, but they\u2019re kinda the outliers in my allergies. \nBut I also find it strange that I cannot eat animal products, but I can cuddle all the pets without problem.", "Wtf is wrong with them???? I have friends with cat allergies and feel bad when they come over and then shove their own faces into my cats fur, like this is them making the active choice to cuddle with animals that make it hard to breathe and I feel terrible. I'll never understand the need to \"test\" somebody's allergies.", "The severity of the reactions you\u2019re describing is why I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s something additional happening with the parents. With these severe reactions, there\u2019s clear physical indications that something is wrong. None of the info provided by OP clarified that the stepfather is having any type of reaction. \n\nIt feels like we\u2019re missing a lot of info here, and I\u2019m wondering what the parents would tell us if they were involved in the discussion.", "She\u2019s tried everything including shots, nothing touches it if the dander is airborne. If it\u2019s on clothing, we can keep a little distance and she\u2019s ok. If she goes to any flat/house with a cat in it, the trouble starts with something similar to an asthma attack and her throat starts closing.\n\nWe\u2019re all incredibly careful about being around her in enclosed spaces, especially cars. Only people with no pets can provide rides, etc. We do our best to be mindful, no one deserves a medical emergency just to hang out with friends.", "While I backed away from them right away, it took me a long time to process what had actually happened.", "This is all adults here who want to socialize but can\u2019t because of allergic reactions. My kid is disappointed they can\u2019t train the dogs to be better which everyone wants. \n\nAllergies are terrible & life threatening & people that don\u2019t have them are not understanding or tolerant. People die from allergies. I\u2019ve been close & been hospitalized for weeks  due to allergies & a chest cold that caused hypoxia.\n\nHave some sympathy & patience for the guy even though he\u2019s a step dad", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear :( but it\u2019s great to hear she at least has such a wonderful network who are helpful of accommodating her needs", "I have no doubt about that. It's basically attempted murder, and for what?\n\nI'm anaphylactic to peanuts and we really moved away from my extended in laws because they have this weird fascination with peanuts that they won't drop. I had to spend hours outside in 90 degree July weather with my brother in law, because they just had to have a peanut butter cake that they refused to cover. It took 6 months to really process that they don't actually care about my health, just their own wants, and that only happened when they had Christmas and had ONLY peanut desserts. My husband's brother called my husband spitting mad that this would be the second holiday that his husband and I would have to either not be there or spend the entire time outside.", "They were just lucky it was an outside event, I don't want to know what could have happened if it was inside.  But yeah, people are assholes about allergies and other disability issues, I don't get it."]}
