{"id": 29836, "submission_id": "17ic7ob", "title": "AITA for not making concessions for a family member with dog allergies?", "selftext": "Edit: Quick note to say I\u2019m reading all the answers and for the most part I\u2019m very appreciative of all the anecdotes, opinions, comments and discussions. I thought it would be obvious that there is a lot of detail missing from this story, as it\u2019s a 2 paragraph AITA post, and I of course had to filter down and be succinct. Some additional context to address some of the wild accusations: nobody is hoarding, my parents want to see us and my children and we want to see them, my parents are envious that my in-laws get to do a lot more of the childcare, and my step dad is taking immunotherapy shots (about a year in). The main question was to really revolve around the idea that when they ask us to accommodate some how, we do it, and then there is an additional ask that comes up the next time we see them. When we accommodate that additional ask, another one eventually follows. It is perpetual and never ending. Hence the question, \u201cAITA if I stop humouring their requests?\u201d\n\n\nMy step dad has been around for 20 years. We\u2019ve always known he had dog allergies but it\u2019s never been an issue. Within the last 3 years it\u2019s become the focus of every conversation though; it is THE issue in our family. I grew up with a dog at my other parent\u2019s home and when I moved out on my own got a dog of my own. My sibling also owns a dog. It was never an issue; we lived with him for a period of time, we would go for weekly dinners once we moved out, we\u2019d drop the grandkids off for a day with the grandparents, etc. \n\nWhen the pandemic happened suddenly there was this massive anxiety around my step father\u2019s lung health and allergies. We stopped being invited for dinner, if we did get invited we were asked to shower and wear fresh clothes, they stopped watching the grandkids, we stopped doing holidays/celebrations in their home, and it\u2019s now gotten to a point where they insist it\u2019s better for them to come to our dog filled home for a visit than it is for us to track dog dander into their environment. It feels like every time I concede to a request the goal post is moved and there\u2019s another demand\u2026 and it\u2019s starting to feel like my step fathers healthcare is my problem to solve. If I don\u2019t concede and humour their requests it means I don\u2019t see my family and my kids don\u2019t see their grandparents.\n\nThe most recent ask was that we celebrate a family birthday at a rental location instead of their home. We haven\u2019t been in their home since Nov 2022. It just seems so ridiculous to me, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m trivializing his allergies or if they could seriously have become so suddenly severe that this is our new reality.\n\nAITA if I stop humouring their requests and the end result is a more distant relationship?", "created_utc": 1698494215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ic7ob/aita_for_not_making_concessions_for_a_family/", "score": 450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't really get to gauge the seriousness or validity of someone else's physical or mental health, especially someone much older than you.

My extended family had dogs and I can\u2019t tell you the number of holidays and parties that I had a reaction that left me sick and miserable. I\u2019ve had my eyeballs swell out of my face, my lips swell and crack, rashes over such large sections of my body that the individual hives melted together and became huge intolerable itchy areas, and asthma attacks where o was exhausted from breathing. And it sucked. It felt like my family didn\u2019t care that I got so sick. As an adult it still sucks. I tried allergy shots, I\u2019m long past the age I might grow out of it, and I\u2019m on daily allergy meds. I still get reactions from minimal contact with things I\u2019m allergic to. And as we get older, some illnesses suck harder. I got strep last year in my 40s. Felt like I got hit with a truck. It was worse than Covid. I had rashes for weeks because my immune system was a hot mess, and my asthma took 6 months to get under control. \n\nI\u2019m allergic to dog fur, dander and saliva.

Antihistamines, injections, steroids, inhalers... you name it. None of it works. They have to find a certificated pet-free rental nearby any time they want to visit, and she still has to load up on meds for the few hours they visit per day.

It's possible that they're still just looking for a good solution and while that feels to you like they're constantly moving goal posts, I'm quite sure that's not their intention.\n\nIn terms of advice, the only thing I can think is maybe to keep some clean vac-packed clothes somewhere that you can change into before going to theirs. Or if they can visit you from time to time, perhaps have a room in your house that the dogs don't go into and put air purifiers with hepa filters in there.

They\u2019ve been trying to find compromises - it sounds like he\u2019d rather dose up and suffer in your home with the animals as opposed to bringing allergens into the house. And now they\u2019re trying to find alternate locations - that\u2019s FINE. \n\nKnow what rental places mean? No allergens. Less clean up. No one\u2019s home gets trashed, and no one person is stuck with hosting. \n\nMy extended family regularly rents a community space for Christmas and thanksgiving gatherings. There are multiple toilets, lots of space for small kids to run, it isn\u2019t crammed, and everyone brings something for a potluck so no one is stuck with the expense and work of hosting. That can work really nicely for large family gatherings. \n\nFor smaller things just your unit and your parents? Meeting up in public to do things with the kids is great. They\u2019ll have a lot more memories of being places with their grandparents. It doesn\u2019t even have to cost money, lots of public spaces are free. \n\nYou can make it work relatively easily if you stop protesting and start working with your parents.", "Sounds like he\u2019s making his allergy his main personality trait and using it to control everything.", "Maybe they don't want your kids in their house, is that a possibility?", "YTA. It sounds like THEY are the ones who are accommodating YOU, and you are dismissing his health issues and acting like you know better than he does about his own allergies. You sound like the type of person who gaslights people about the pain they're in because you've privately decided they're being melodramatic. Let me guess, you've \"been through worse\" and \"didn't complain about it\"", "YTA OP.  I know it's an inconvenience that you and your family are no longer welcomed at their house but you have to understand that your stepfather is now older and his body is no longer able to tolerate what he tolerated before.  And your parents aren't making his health problems your problem to solve, they are **trying** to come up with solutions so that they can still be active with you and your family while protecting your stepfather from severe allergy attacks.  And yes it may be easier for them to visit you because like other's said, once they get home, they may strip out of their clothing in the garage or right inside the door and place clothing inside of a trash bag until your Mom can wash them and jump in the shower right away so as to not spread any dander or whatever is affecting your stepfather inside of their house.  And the same goes for not having you and your family visit them; they have to worry about you all bringing into their house whatever is affecting him.\n\nYou have no idea how hard it is when you have allergies, COVID long effects, COPD, Emphysema, Asthma or any condition that affects the lungs.  The struggles of just trying to breathe and the mental anguish of trying to live a normal life while not trying to affect others lives because of your illness.  Believe you me, it bothers them as much as it bothers you.  I am lucky that my kids/grandkids, Mom, Brother/SIL and most of my family and friends understand.  I guess their understanding comes from hearing me coughing uncontrollably during phone conversations as I try to catch my breath.  But it bothers me that at 60, I am not able to participate with a lot of activities with said family and friends.  And it bothers me that knowing the older I get, my body isn't able to tolerate and recover as I used to be able to do.  Yes, I am receiving treatment and therapy exercises for my lungs because my lung doctor is trying to keep me off of oxygen for as long as she can.", "NAH\n\nFor perspective, the severity of allergies absolutely shifts, in and of itself, over time. (You can develop allergies, and you can find that they resolve. My sister found unexpectedly one day that she had a hospital-level reaction to something we all have a mild sensitivity to, but have always enjoyed in moderation. She now carries an epipen. Overnight.)\n\nBut also, it sounds like what you've said is that your stepfather has complex health problems including issues with his lungs. Those are more recent, or they are worsening. \nAnd allergies don't exist in a body in a vacuum.... The inflammation they trigger contributes to making asthma worse (for instance) and having trouble breathing will of course make any congestion and inflammation from allergies more impactful. (Double whammy \"hard to breathe\").\n\nSo for all of these reasons, yes, it's entirely within reason that their level of protectiveness and care over his health may have shifted.\n\nIt's also possible that the pandemic was the first time he'd had a stretch of time WITHOUT exposure to dander, and it was the first time he could actually see what level of symptoms it triggers. (Sometimes if we are fine in one space or circumstance, but not another, it makes clear what we are reacting to.) \n\nAll of that said, it is perfectly reasonable to want a finish line. (I suspect he wants one, too. Bodies don't come with instruction manuals, we have to figure out our limits through trial and error.)\n\nIt's actually reasonable for them to ask you to change into fresh clothes before going over. Or to meet in a separate space. They aren't asking you to all get rid of your dogs, just to help them figure out how to safely be connected family AND not make Poppa sick. My guess is the moving benchmark is frustrating them as much as you, when they try solution B and it *still isn't enough* so they brainstorm the next one.\n\nFor now, go have meals in a restaurant. Change clothes RIGHT before you go so everyone can hug!\nAnd then strategize what works for all of you. Ask how your SD felt after that meal, and see if that was enough... Then take it from there.\n\nMaybe your parents can keep a set of \"safe\" clothes for the kids at their house, and when the kids come for a visit, they change in the entryway! \n\nOr if they are an age that enjoys them, they might go straight for a bath with bubbles and grandparent toys, and then into grandparent house jammies. \n\nBe willing to be creative. They WANT to stay connected, and reasonably, they also want SD not to get sick every time he hugs the babies he loves.", "NTA. There is  the possibility that your stepdad's lung health has declined over the past few years and they keep a spotless home. I have a friend who has serious lung issues with asthma and COPD (never smoked a cigarette). It could be they just don't want to risk him getting that one infection or reaction that will end his life. It sounds like it could be an actual serious health issue. While NTA I do think you should try to be more understanding. However, since it's his medical issue, he should be the one responsible for the rental fee.", "NTA for not making concessions however I don\u2019t think this is really about the dog allergy. Maybe they really don\u2019t want the responsibility of toddler proofing their home. Cleaning up before and after having messing kids over takes a toll on older adults & hosting is a lot of work. All toddlers are messy. By using a rental the clean up & responsibilities for your kids falls on you instead of them.  Offer to host at your home if you don\u2019t want to pack up for a rental. It sounds like hosing responsibilities needs to move to your generation instead of your parents.", "My in laws sound similar but not about dogs- about our kids. They are convinced kids are walking talking buckets of germ (which they sometimes are- I teach Kindergarten so I\u2019m realistic!) but my kids are not little anymore- they are 15, 14 and 11. They are old enough to tell us when they aren\u2019t feeling well, cover their coughs, wash their hands, avoid people when sick, etc. This has become so bad that my 11 year old coughed at last Thanksgiving ONCE (she later told me she ate too much cornbread and was out of water so she had dry cornbread in her throat and that made her cough) and my in laws left. Mid-dinner, just left. They also insist on everyone taking a Covid test before we get together even if we are all healthy and feeling well. They need to SEE these test results via text picture bc apparently they don\u2019t think we would cancel if someone tested positive. It\u2019s like a weird older generation paranoia. I chalk it up to them being older and retiring and not having much to do all day so they just obsess about random stuff like that.", "OP, soft YTA. I know it's frustrating, but this is a health condition.\n\nI have asthma and allergies. When COVID first started, I did not realize how much I was exposed to allergens, until I was home and not exposed to them all the time. I felt amazing, like an entirely new person. The amount I could function was unreal. When the world started to open back up, is when I started to run into issues. I kept masking, but my family members, like you kept feeling I was being annoying and just \"moving the goal post\" when I had to keep up with the ever changing data from the CDC and information from my doctors to keep myself safe. It is heart breaking to relay this information to family members and instead of the responses being that of support, getting responses of frustration, anger, annoyance and being treated like we are doing this maliciously. \n\nYour step father probably was exposed to a certain amount of dog allergen on a daily basis before COVID, and then was not exposed at all during. Which is why now the allergy is so much worse. Just show some compassion and empathy, and be supportive, follow their request, it's just for a day or a few hours whatever it may be.

Never had lung issues before and now anything makes them feel inflamed overall and stabbing pain at the worst.  It's really kind of horrible. I was complaining to my husband yesterday that it must be so nice to go through life without allergies. No need to pick apart your food, being able to work in the yard on a wet day without suffering afterward. I'm not a whiner usually, but it can be worse than you expect and medication doesn't take care of all of it.", "Sorry but I think YTA here. I also have dog allergies (though not as severe as your step dad\u2019s!), and it\u2019s a huge PITA. I think the issue is that, if he goes to your place, it\u2019s pretty straightforward for him (and your mother, presumably) to remove any stray dander on their bodies and clothes when they return home than it would be for them to deep-clean their whole house to get rid of what you and your family might have unknowingly tracked in. Allergies can absolutely change and get more severe over time (my grandmother developed a severe, anaphylaxis-inducing allergy to nuts in her 60s), so it\u2019s possible that your step dad has noticed that his have become worse recently and doesn\u2019t want to risk it.

Also, if you listen to older people's conversations they can revolve around who has recently died, whose health condition has got worse, and the current status of their own medical conditions. My mother texts on an almost daily basis with reports on her hearing/arthritis/coughing etc. She seems to want the attention and sympathy you get from being ill, but it can wear very thin. \n\nSo whilst it seems personal it is a symptom of getting old, less healthy and becoming more inward focussed.

I can't get too close to her at times without my allergies going nuts, but I'd much rather be around her and her cat clothes in my house than be in their house with the actual cats and the furniture they are all over with their dander/saliva/etc.", "Maybe they don't want chaotic toddlers at their home and the allergies are just an excuse? Anyway, you can't exactly invite yourself in their homes if they don't want you there.", "> Packing my kids up, dinner, all the plastic utensils and plates for my kids, toys, and going to a non-kid proofed rental just seems wildly inconvenient.\n\nInconvenient to you. You don\u2019t know what kind of cleaning they have to do before and after you come to their house. If they have to kid proof before and deep clean their house after your visit then that\u2019s a lot more work than getting toddlers ready to go.\n\nYTA", "Go to a family friendly restaurant. \n\nYTA. Stop diminishing and ridiculing your step dad\u2019s allergies.", "Well also hosting, cooking, cleaning and everything is not that convenient for them. Did you propose hosting at yours? Cause you said their are weirdly ok to come over yours. This is why I think it\u2019s more then the allergy, the lack of energy to host themselves.", "You\u2019re not getting it! Stop making this about you and your entitlement.", "See I have young kids too and this doesn\u2019t add up to me. A rental seems so much easier than a non-kid proofed grandparent house (I hate them!) or cleaning my house enough to host.", ">But it\u2019s uncomfortable and awkward.\n\nSo you'd rather your stepdad suffer health issues (that may be serious, worst case life-threatening--allergies can change and get worse with time!) than be inconvenienced? Yeah, YTA for downplaying his health issues and putting your own comfort over his health.", "I have no real idea if the shots actually helped - I think they did tone down some of mine to a level that's mostly manageable with OTC medication, but I think I just grew out of some of the food allergies. But my worst allergies were rabbits and oak trees, and I still have a bad time in the spring or if I get around rabbits or someone who owns one.", "Honestly they're a pain, no pun intended. Maybe things have changed since I went, considering it's been like 30 years but it sucked. I think I had to go every week or two weeks at first? Fresh vials are the worst because the mixture is more potent and my arm would always swell up. The mix loses potentcy over time, so they give a bit more each week until it ran out, then rinse and repeat.\n\nHad to sit there for 15 or 20 minutes to make sure that the shot wasn't going to send me into anaphylaxis every time, and still had to deal with an itchy rash for a couple of days. And I did it for literal years but hey, I can eat citrus now! \ud83d\ude05", "Nasal sprays aren't for everyone.  They're either corticosteroids or methamphetamine isomers, neither of which are universally tolerate.  \n\nThe steroid sprays don't do anything for me and the other sprays, even if I take them first thing in the morning, cause me to not be able to sleep at least a night a week.", "I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s stubborn and set in his ways, but not violent. An example of the stubbornness is that we had to more or less beg him to seek immunotherapy treatment for allergies. He didn\u2019t want to do it, so he put it off, and the rest of us adapted our lifestyles to minimize allergen exposure. Definitely not a mentally or physically violent situation AFAIK.", "So we should risk anaphylaxis?  Would you say the same about a severe food allergy?\n\nI don't think this is a case of a severe allergy like mine, as much as it's something else going on, like some mental health issue like anxiety or OCD that is causing a focus on the allergy and contamination, because I could never go into someone elses's house who has dogs without risk of a severe reaction.", "Yes definitely.. if the allergy is that severe going to OP's how would not be manageable as the house is full of the allergen. There is something else going on", "I have friends with lots of dogs, but also lost friends when I developed the allergy.  The ones with lots of dogs that stayed as friends are the ones who understood that it wasn't my fault, some have seen reactions.  We meet outside of homes-  sometimes they come to my house, but usually outside, I luckily have an awesome space outside for entertaining.  Some of the others \"tested\" me once at an event by putting a bag of dog hair under my chair without me knowing, and when my face swelled up told me it was just grass, and argued with me even after I figured out what had happened.  I no longer talk to them.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear about the severity of your friend\u2019s allergies, but do you know if they\u2019ve tried different medicines with different antihistamines as active ingredient? I found my go to antihistamines when I was ~20, after an entire life of both respiratory, contact and food allergies, and it\u2019s been a game changer for me! The good shit is prescription where I live, but there are smaller dose pills with the same active ingredient that are available over the counter and even they help a little bit! (The active ingredient is desloratadine, I\u2019m severely sensitive to diphenhydramine (Benadryl) so I sadly know the struggle of common drugs just not flying \ud83d\ude44). I know this is a bit off topic for the post, but before my own find, I had no idea it was about trying different active ingredients and I hope someone else out there could be as pleasantly surprised as myself!", "My kid just had this issue & visited a place. Two hours max , had to change her clothes leaving, blister lines where  the dander was rubbed across skin. It was a happy visit but dangerous to them.\n\nI can\u2019t have a dog/pet in my house bc it would take too long to be safe for us.\n\nAllergies are the worst. Lucky for you it can just be annoying to deal with the persons attempts to keep themselves safe & risk their lives to keep up the visits. \n\nYou have no idea idea what choices you have to make. I can stay until my throat is closing up & im struggling to breathe. Hopefully fresh air and leaving the situation will be enough to breath comfortably soon.", "Currently going through mine, I've had weekly shots for like a year and this last vial is hitting me so hard! Last weeks was so bad that even after multiple allergy meds and hits of my inhaler I couldn't talk through the coughing and I needed a very painful steroid shot. We went down a dose this week but two days later my arm is still bruised from the giant hive :( it is helping with the allergies though, I was able to go outside in the summer time! Very excited to go to monthly shots, I'm developing a tolerance to the sedatives I need to take to get needles at all and it sucks", "It can be up to 3X a week at first for 6 months and then literal years of maintenance. People are talking out their ass on this post as if it\u2019s just a quick shot anyone would be declining with such severe allergies.", "There are more kinds of abuse than physical contact", "I didn\u2019t say that. Every person has to make the decision that is best for them.", "He could dope himself up enough to keep breathing temporarily, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s interested in sterilizing his living space.", "I'm so sorry it's a rough process for you! It's for sure not an easy thing like a lot of people seem to think, but I'm so stoked that you were able to see some real results! I was lucky that I never needed a steroid shot but man, I had the hives and needed my inhaler a few times too, and the golf ball-sized lump and the soreness was no joke for sure.", "I thought so, I just couldn't remember since it's been for-fucking-ever so I didn't want to claim it was more often and be wrong! But yeah, I basically had shots routinely for about 6 *years* to get what was honestly pretty minimal results. I am absolutely terrified of needles, but if it was as easy as \"just get an allergy shot lol\" hell yes I would!", "But that's why I question this-  they feel safe enough to go into a house with dogs, but not safe enough to let someone who has dogs into their house.", "Thank you! Yeah the golf ball lump is so uncomfortable and gross"]}
