As a Jew myself, it is super important to openly foster relationships with people outside our culture and Muslims. Showing that a Jew is donating to your Ramadan fund is actually a bonus because it can help break down barriers and stereotypes. And honestly, some one who is so prejudiced and closed mindedthat they don't even want to look at a Jewish person's name on a charity or even receive... They have a lot to learn and a lot to work on about themselves, which has nothing to do with your friend.\n\nYTA for singling out your friend AND being close minded yourself about how this situation could actually be a positive.", "Dude, I completely disagree. \n\nThis guy is YTA all the way. \n\nI get both sides too, and I'm sure his Jewish friend would have happily donated if it was a case of \"we're all donating anonymously\". \n\nInstead, it became: \"YOU need to donate anonymously because you have a Jewish sounding name\". \n\nOP accepts that people have prejudices against Jews, and doesn't want to cause any issues. I get that, too - But surely he's gone the wrong way about it?", "Just to add - I have always been taught that tzedakah from the point of anonymity is an even greater gift because you ask for nothing in return. Not even recognition of the deed. \n\nSaying that - I think while good intentioned, OP is TA.  His friend is an adult and understands what he is attaching his name to.

Physical danger. I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if some in our friend circle get attacked either verbally or physically once someone knows that we are associating with a Jew. I'm only like this because I'm more open-minded than the other Muslims in this region but the others are definitely not, maybe a gift from a Christian or an atheist wouldn't be loved as much as a gift from another Muslim but would still be appreciated as a form of \"just nice foreigners who want to help us\" so most likely no risk but associating with a Jew to get them a gift might mean to the others that I'm supporting them or even thinking I have a malicious intent to put something in these products.\n2. Social danger. If enough people know about this then our workplaces might be informed too and that would lead to wrong accusations about us which can render us jobless and attract unwarranted attention for an undetermined while. The consequences are literally limitless.\n\nAssociating with a Jew is no joke, it's safe in America or Europe but definitely not safe here. It's not as simple as \"Oh this is from a Jew? F\\*\\*k you\" and they peacefully leave, it's more like \"Oh this is from a Jew? So you support Israel, huh?

Maybe find recipients who wouldn\u2019t have such a problem? \n\nI get that that\u2019s pretty hard to guarantee considering the extreme level of Jew hatred that exists in a lot of Islamic countries.\n\nAlternative is take all your names off and have it be entirely anonymous - anonymising only the Jew is antisemitism, even if it\u2019s only because you fear personal repercussions for associating with said Jew.", "Are you implying the entire \u201cMuslim community\u201d is antisemitic or are you saying it\u2019s okay to be antisemitic e cause of the existence of Israel?

All that backlash for what? UAE is not gonna be a \"progressive\" country anytime soon and if they put his name it's just gonna be a bunch of backlash for no payback except the dude gets recognition.
