I owe her everything.\n\nBut I doubt I would be paid back, and it feels like I'm enabling someone who has spun out of control with their finances.

My biggest sticking point here is that she won't tell you what she spent it on. That means she's either embarrassed, knows what she spent it on is wrong, or knows you won't approve (or some combination). None of them are good, but they're still not the problem. It's like an addiction. When you recognise you have a problem, you can work on stopping. When you tell people what the problem is they can help hold you accountable. When you keep it a secret? What's to stop you from continuing on the way you were? If she won't tell you what the money was for and you bail her out, what's to stop this happening again?\n\n125k is a *lot* of money. I'm honestly astonished that someone who is technically unemployed could even get a line of credit that high (I'm assuming you're in the US, and I am not familiar with credit regulations there). The money you got from your suit it to compensate *you* for your struggle and hardship, if you lend it to her and she hasn't stopped spending you're never going to see it again.\n\nLeading to my last point, that I put on every post about lending money. Only lend money that you're happy to never see back. In this case, there's an added layer of escaping consequences from the credit card company and her possibly believing that means there will be *no* consequences. After all, would her loving son bankrupt her? No, he'd just let her keep the money.\n\nStay strong, don't lend her the money.", "If she isn't telling you what was owed then I wouldn't pay it.\n\nDoes your mom own any assets? \nIf she has a reasonable asset, you can \"buy that asset\" and rent it back to her.\n\nIf there are no assets, I'd suggest bankrupcy.", "> Mom called me and revealed that over the last year, she has accrued $125,000 in credit card debt.  \n>  \n> \"is it really important for you to know the answer to that question?\"   \n>  \n>Whatever she spent it on, she is cagey about telling me and it's clear she has dug herself a $125K hole.\n\nYes, it really is important for you to know the answer because **she has dug herself a $125,000 hole in one year**. If you don't know how and why she did it, you can't determine if she can pay it back with 5% over 5 years? \n\n> it feels like I'm enabling someone who has spun out of control with their finances. \n\nWhich is why you need the answer to the questions of how and why. The fact she won't answer is a strong indicator that she did something she knows is stupid and doesn't want you to know. There are many possibilities, but the short time frame makes me wonder if it she didn't fall victim to scam, maybe a romance scam.", "NTA. Regardless of any circumstances, you are allowed to do whatever you like with your own money. Regarding these circumstances in particular though, there are a few red flags in that she won\u2019t tell you how she got into the debt, and you can\u2019t be sure she won\u2019t spend this money to erase her debt just to fall back into debt again. \nFurther, I am raising my children as a single woman (full custody) and my children owe me nothing.

It's nice you'd even sound willing to help, but it's a red flag that she won't disclose an itemized list or even have a plan for her to get back on her feet.  You're also right, you'd likely not be paid back, be it because \"I am your mother, why should I pay you back?\" to her just not being able to get her finances in order.
