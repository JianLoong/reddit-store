I (42m) has always had a difficult time dealing with my bil's excessive stubbornness. I always used to placate or grin and bear it but I've been getting fed up over the past several months and I've started placing hard boundaries and now it's causing drama.\n\nHere's one example. He and his wife wanted me to babysit their kids so they can go to a wedding. They wanted me to babysit into the next day because they wanted to get drunk.  I explained that I couldn't do that because I had plans in the morning. \n\nBil dug his feet and wouldn't leave the argument alone. So I said due to your excessive stubbornness and refusal to listen I will have to withdraw my offer to watch them. I now have a rule where ones loses out on whatever they wanted from me if they get too stubborn. \n\nThis has caused some drama. His teen daughters and others are on my side while others think that he should be placated to \"keep the peace\" \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685985072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141la8d/aita_for_placing_hard_boundaries_in_regards_to_my/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BIL sounds not just stubborn but a self-important and argumentative bully. If this is just one of many recent examples, then it sounds like your boundaries are needed and overdue. If his teenage daughters can't be left alone overnight then he can hire a babysitter who at least will be compensated with money, if not respect.", "NTA\n\nSet boundaries and stand up for yourself. You are NTA. Valid reasons to decline babysitting into the next day. Your brother-in-law's stubbornness and refusal to listen can be frustrating, leading you to a breaking point. By declining to babysit, you established boundaries and asserted your own limits.\n\n Prioritize your well-being instead of enabling unhealthy behavior by placating your brother-in-law. Set boundaries and communicate them, despite potential conflict. It's good that his teen daughters and others support you, showing understanding. Surround yourself with respectful and appreciative individuals. Talk calmly to your brother-in-law to resolve the problem. Explain why you set boundaries, emphasizing healthy relationship establishment instead of conflict.", "NTA - Anyone who says you should 'keep the peace' are enabling shitty behavior.  In your place I would take the opportunity to make note of who is enabling this bullshit and excise them from my life.  But then, as I've gotten older I've developed a desire for scorched earth problem solving, because when you do that, you don't ever have that problem again.", "NTA-If you\u2019re doing someone a favor they don\u2019t get to dictate all the terms and there\u2019s no reason you should have to allow your boundaries to be violated to keep the peace.", "Uhm, point out that placating never works in the long run. History is full of examples that prove this point. \n\nNo, NTA all the way here, OP. \n\nYour BIL wants to get drunk? Fine, then he should have made plans that don't conflict with yours. That's what being an adult is all about!", ">Others think that he should be placated to \"keep the peace\"\n\nThis is why people get away with the things that they do.  Others bend to \"keep the peace\" when the person who is causing the issue suffers no consequence for their actions.\n\nGood for standing your ground, now BIL is learning he can only push but so far with you before he loses.  It may take him a few rounds, but he will learn.\n\nTell those who think he should be placated that **they** should placate him by watching the kids overnight.\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "*\u201cPlacated to keep the peace\u201d*\n\nYeah, that\u2019s called enabling. Keep those boundaries firm, OP. Let the rest of the family deal with the BS, you keep your peace. NTA.", "NTA. You are doing BIL a huge favor by babysitting. He is WAY out of line demanding that you do more than you are willing. People like him do not understand reason, they understand consequences. And consequences is what you have given him. Good for you.", "NTA Im tired of placating assholes", "NTA \"keep the peace\" people are why society is on fire", "NTA, in this case.\n\nI think it\u2019s fine to say \u201chere\u2019s what I can do for you, and it seems like doesn\u2019t work with your needs, so you should find someone else.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s overly petty to revoke the offer entirely if they figure out how to get to something inside your offer, just because you don\u2019t like how they got there.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndON'T keep the peac, defend your boundaries.", "NTA\n\n> others think that he should be placated to \"keep the peace\" \n\nPeace is overrated.", "NTA.

He's usually a decent enough guy but he can't admit he was wrong and he won't get an idea out of his head once it's there.", "I've completely stopped with placating bad behavior even if it a result of mental Illness", "Keeping the peace is a loser strategy that results in you living someone else's life.", "Yes. More people need to do this. It would do so much to end this behavior.", "INFO: what ages are the kids? You say \u201ckids\u201d but then you mention teenagers.", "NTA.

You are training toxic people to pass on you with their shenanigans.  This is what it takes until the lightbulb comes on.  Let the other flying monkeys deal with his bs.  Once he learns he can't get anywhere with you he'll take his bs straight to them.  Let them be all stressed out while you're living life.

You are entirely correct to put in place and enforce boundaries with your BIL. So many people will do anything, including be miserable themselves and ensure that you're miserable too instead of facing up to a bully.\n\nSo what if BIL complains? He just shows what how inconsiderate he is when he pushes and pushes and pushes to get his way. In my experience placating someone leads to more and more of their bad behavior.", "NTA.  Placate to keep the peace?  You must be joking.  When someone offers help, you say thank you I appreciate the favor.  You don\u2019t make demands and become stubborn like a mule.  You don\u2019t need to placate (surrender) to anyone to keep the peace.  BIL needs to learn how to work well with others.  If he can\u2019t or won\u2019t he can figure out how to do things on his own.", "NTA.\n\n\"Keeping the peace\" is why your BiL is so stubborn.  He knows he'll get his way if he keeps arguing because everyone else is too busy keeping the peace to stand up to him.", "NTA you teach people how to treat you. You\u2019re teaching him a good lesson and one to refer to in the future to show you\u2019re serious. Well done!", "NTA - and the ones who advocate for \u201cplacating\u201d the grown-ups acting as children should step in to deal with them.", "NTA\n\nYour example isn't even one of stubbornness, it's an example of a worse trait. Not respecting you and your time. This isn't an issue of not being able to admit when you're wrong, it's him selfishly thinking that his wants outweigh yours and thinking he can just order you around.\n\nYour consequence is totally fair. Someone who cannot appreciate the favors you agree to do for them should not be afforded favors at all. This also erases the possibility of him doing something like just not coming home for the night and expecting you to just make do since you're already babysitting, which isn't unheard of when it comes to people like that.", "Congratulations on leaving BIL's boat and no longer being 1 of his stabilizers. Warning that other will try to pull you back onto that boat but stiffen up that spin and stay on course. Definitely NTA. Actions have consequences and he now gets to endure them. Even if those consequences have a negative effect on him.", "NTA you tried to make the favor they asked work. But they tried to force you into a situation you didn't want to do, so instead of keep fighting. You bowed out. You couldn't help them in the way they wanted so they need to find someone else.", "NTA\n\nIt seems to me that the one always being told to \"keep the peace\" is never the one causing any strife!", "NTA. Placating to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d is a joke.

If the others think he should be placated, let them babysit.", "\"Keep the peace\"?!  Seriously?  WTAF?   He's an immature jackass who needs to grow up.  Good for you for setting boundaries, but honestly, you should've done it sooner.  NTA, but your BIL def is.", "NTA\n\nDo they pay you for babysitting? If not, then it makes no sense that they would be so rude. If your offering to do them a favor, they should be more willing to do it on your terms. Also, if they have a teenage daughter, why do they need babysitters? Just wondering. \nYou\u2019re definitely not in the wrong for standing your ground.", "NTA. Never EVER do anything because people want to \"keep the peace.\" It's literally only used when they KNOW the other person is in the wrong but they find it easier to browbeat you into submission than correct the bad behaviour.", "His teens are probably just as tired of his bs at this point", "NTA. We need more of these posts.", "NTA, your a grown ass man, who does he think he is, to tell you what to do,and what your going to do in your life. Stick to your guns, and be just as stubborn till he gets the message."]}
