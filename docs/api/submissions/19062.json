I (42m) has always had a difficult time dealing with my bil's excessive stubbornness. I always used to placate or grin and bear it but I've been getting fed up over the past several months and I've started placing hard boundaries and now it's causing drama.\n\nHere's one example. He and his wife wanted me to babysit their kids so they can go to a wedding. They wanted me to babysit into the next day because they wanted to get drunk.  I explained that I couldn't do that because I had plans in the morning. \n\nBil dug his feet and wouldn't leave the argument alone. So I said due to your excessive stubbornness and refusal to listen I will have to withdraw my offer to watch them. I now have a rule where ones loses out on whatever they wanted from me if they get too stubborn. \n\nThis has caused some drama. His teen daughters and others are on my side while others think that he should be placated to \"keep the peace\" \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685985072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141la8d/aita_for_placing_hard_boundaries_in_regards_to_my/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BIL sounds not just stubborn but a self-important and argumentative bully. If this is just one of many recent examples, then it sounds like your boundaries are needed and overdue. If his teenage daughters can't be left alone overnight then he can hire a babysitter who at least will be compensated with money, if not respect.", "NTA\n\nSet boundaries and stand up for yourself. You are NTA. Valid reasons to decline babysitting into the next day. Your brother-in-law's stubbornness and refusal to listen can be frustrating, leading you to a breaking point. By declining to babysit, you established boundaries and asserted your own limits.\n\n Prioritize your well-being instead of enabling unhealthy behavior by placating your brother-in-law. Set boundaries and communicate them, despite potential conflict. It's good that his teen daughters and others support you, showing understanding. Surround yourself with respectful and appreciative individuals. Talk calmly to your brother-in-law to resolve the problem. Explain why you set boundaries, emphasizing healthy relationship establishment instead of conflict.", "NTA - Anyone who says you should 'keep the peace' are enabling shitty behavior.  In your place I would take the opportunity to make note of who is enabling this bullshit and excise them from my life.  But then, as I've gotten older I've developed a desire for scorched earth problem solving, because when you do that, you don't ever have that problem again.", "NTA-If you\u2019re doing someone a favor they don\u2019t get to dictate all the terms and there\u2019s no reason you should have to allow your boundaries to be violated to keep the peace.", "Uhm, point out that placating never works in the long run. History is full of examples that prove this point. \n\nNo, NTA all the way here, OP. \n\nYour BIL wants to get drunk? Fine, then he should have made plans that don't conflict with yours. That's what being an adult is all about!", ">Others think that he should be placated to \"keep the peace\"\n\nThis is why people get away with the things that they do.  Others bend to \"keep the peace\" when the person who is causing the issue suffers no consequence for their actions.\n\nGood for standing your ground, now BIL is learning he can only push but so far with you before he loses.  It may take him a few rounds, but he will learn.\n\nTell those who think he should be placated that **they** should placate him by watching the kids overnight.\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "*\u201cPlacated to keep the peace\u201d*\n\nYeah, that\u2019s called enabling. Keep those boundaries firm, OP. Let the rest of the family deal with the BS, you keep your peace. NTA.", "NTA. You are doing BIL a huge favor by babysitting. He is WAY out of line demanding that you do more than you are willing. People like him do not understand reason, they understand consequences. And consequences is what you have given him. Good for you.", "NTA Im tired of placating assholes", "NTA \"keep the peace\" people are why society is on fire", "NTA, in this case.\n\nI think it\u2019s fine to say \u201chere\u2019s what I can do for you, and it seems like doesn\u2019t work with your needs, so you should find someone else.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s overly petty to revoke the offer entirely if they figure out how to get to something inside your offer, just because you don\u2019t like how they got there.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndON'T keep the peac, defend your boundaries.", "NTA\n\n> others think that he should be placated to \"keep the peace\" \n\nPeace is overrated.", "NTA. Don't placate a bully to keep the peace. You will be used and abused. Anyone else is welcome to step up and help BIL whenever **they** feel the need to keep the peace.", "I think the daughters were with their mom that weekend. He's usually a decent enough guy but he can't admit he was wrong and he won't get an idea out of his head once it's there.", "I've completely stopped with placating bad behavior even if it a result of mental Illness", "Keeping the peace is a loser strategy that results in you living someone else's life.", "Yes. More people need to do this. It would do so much to end this behavior."]}
