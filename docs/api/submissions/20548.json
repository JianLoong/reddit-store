My friend brought two friend groups out: her friends from University (me included), and her friends from the cafe/pub she worked at.\n\nI had never met them before. Aside from one or two of the members of that group, they didn\u2019t really try to mingle with us. They were also all in the 29-31 age range while we were all around 24. I had a good time with my friends so it didn\u2019t really matter.\n\nI was at the smoking area trying to talk with the pub group, kinda just small talk but they were mostly ignoring me. Suddenly one of the guys brings up that,\n\n\u201cit\u2019s looking like you\u2019re gonna owe me that 25\u201d to his other friend. \n\nSomeone else asks what it\u2019s about, and he says that the bet is if Josh (one of the guys in the pub group) will go home with Conny. \n\nConny was one of the people from that group who talked to my friends, and we talked a lot that night as we both had an interest in film. When she came out for a smoke, I quietly mentioned what I heard to her.\n\nA small time later Josh takes me aside and asks me about it in a very serious tone, with really aggressive eye contact. When I\u2019m trying to justify why I told her, he keeps interrupting me saying \u201cI don\u2019t care why, I just want to know if you are telling the truth\u201d.\n\nThen I assume he went and talked with his friends about it who denied it completely. Now that whole group thinks I\u2019m trying to start drama, and I\u2019ve woken up to a text from my friend (birthday girl) asking what\u2019s up.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing because I would be upset if I went home with someone, and found out afterwards there was a bet about it.
