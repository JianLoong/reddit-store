So I did what I would want if I were in his shoes, I told him that while it could have changed in the last like 3 days but last I\u2019d heard she had a boyfriend. I tried to be clear that I wouldn\u2019t judge any decisions he made with that information, merely that if it were me I would want to have the information. And it turned out she was still with her boyfriend. I don\u2019t know what was said.

They let about half the population in.", "Well considering the bet was placed on Josh and not the girl, it would not make sense for him to be involved in it. \n\nBetting on if people will hook up is childish but blaming the two people who were victims is not right.

I was simply pointing out that Josh being upset does not mean he didn't know about the bet. \n\nWe don't know if Josh was actually involved or not.

Like literally all signs point to him not knowing. Could he be lying with his reaction? Sure. But the simple answer is usually the best answer: he asked because he didn't know.", "What? They didn\u2019t bet on who the woman was going home with. It clearly states that two guys were betting on if Josh were going home with Conny. Not \u201dwho she went home with\u201d. It is a difference, one incredibly childish to bet on your mates success in talking to girls and one sexist by insinuating certain things about a woman.\n\nOverall I agree that it is very unclear what the bet was actually about and who was involved. And to be fair I don\u2019t think OP is entirerly sure either. \n\nJudgement is NTA for the intentions of looking out for a friend but placing blame on someone else but the two childish friends is difficult.", "Yes. If she would go home with Josh. So she needed to know about that. \n\nAnd while we don't know if Josh knew they were betting or not..... But either way this is his friends group and I'm also betting they do other toxic shit. Do you think this is the first time they've pulled shit like this? \n\nAlso, that's not childish. It's toxic and disgusting. Even teenage boys doing this would be toxic and disgusting.", "Yes I agree, I\u2019ll rephrase it to toxic because either way they are hurting their friends.

They were treating a whole human being like a slot machine, and it's not okay.  They know it's not okay, that's why they're trying to deflect the negativity towards you.  This way, they don't have to deal with the fact that they were behaving like assholes, they can blame you instead.", "The only thing to do is tell your friend, so she can tell Connie immediately. That is some predatory shit. Also calling them out into moment would have been great. Men need to hold each other accountable for sketchy stuffed in closed groups, just like women have to.

Did Josh know about the bet?", "NTA either Josh's 'friends' were betting on his dating life (presuming he was interested in Conny and they knew it and they were betting on his success/failure) behind his back (this seems likely) and him and his prospective should 100% be aware of that weird ass behavior. Or he was a participant (Is it true? and them denying it, makes me think this unlikely) and you saved the girl from being part of some creepy Dennis Reynolds shit. \n\nIf Josh is/was actually interested in Conny and his buddies were truly being creeps behind his back, you didn't even damage any chance of something happening unless Josh decides to believe you lied for no gain, and his friends are telling the truth. 100% the best choice. Who knows what stupid shit they would have said done had you said nothing and they went home together.\n\nThis sounds like two people who work together were hitting it off and the workmates were betting on if 'tonight was the night'. Which 100% can ruin even an organic budding romance because it turns the personal into spectacle.", "NTA - these men are dangerous.  they consider her to be a bike and might well think they don't have to ask to have a ride.\n\nWhen groups of young men get on a private social media groups and focus on women, its not good for the women !!", "NTA and be loud and proud when you say \u201cit happened\u201d over and over and over again.", "NTA.

I warned my friend who then straight up told this guy I accused him, and he aggressively got in my face yelling at me about it. Bro code is a joke.

And a harsh one at that (I'm English, it's harsh for me!).", "Then, shouldn't label him as the opposite either.", "I didn't. I simply pointed out he may not be. And why. As I stated in a previous comment. This is pure speculation on our parts. We also can't assume he's also a victim just because he got mad. Especially as this is his regular group of friends apparently and this usually isn't one off type of behaviors for groups of guys either.

Well I remember a post here that was very similar where a guy was doing the same thing for a woman who was being talked about in a similar way behind her back. Unfortunately the OP also made the mistake of opening up with his feelings on the matter and expressing contempt for fact that guys like that are able to be successful which is an insult to the effort he puts in. He never even outright stated that's why he was doing it! It was just a side thing that made him especially upset to see that. Which Reddit likes to pretend is invalid.\n\nAlso, I believe the scenario in question was that he was with this guy and a bunch of dudes, and he said in reference to a girl he started seeing (also in their friend group but not present) that he \"likes getting easy ass\" and the OP later informed her.\n\nBut yeah despite what you're seeing in this thread, Reddit doesn't mind a woman going home with a man like that, as long as the one informing happens to have feelings of contempt for the situation due to an imbalance - that would be enough to 180 everything to YTA, no matter how bad the stuff that the guy going home with her was saying.", "His \"sure thing\".", "They were guys betting who would \"bag\" a specific target.\n\nIf that doesn't seem wrong to you then there's no reason for this thread to continue.", "That isn't the norm in many social circles including this one based on Josh's reaction.", "Thank you. Single people betting on taking another single person home? The horror!\n\nI'm also confused on what exactly they are \"saving\" her from. A good time? The only thing that matters here is consent, and while I get that objectification sucks to hear - the correlation between that and disrespect for consent is not what everyone makes it out to be.\n\nPeople here seem to be so out of touch and see women as prudes and never take into account the fact that sometimes they're looking for a good time as well - especially with the irony that they're constantly griping about 'sl-t shaming'. When they go out and let loose, how are they less guilty of committing 'objectification'?\n\nPeople in this thread are saying OP 'saved her from possibly going home with a creep' - but let's say she did actually go home with him. So obviously he's not enough of a 'creep' to be able to make it that far. 'Creep' generally refers to advances to begin with - as long as she's into it, the only things she really has to worry about are 1. her consent being respected (which there's been zero indication of otherwise) and 2. that she's not being seduced/led on under false pretenses (e.g. promise of relationship or connection and then ghosting her) which is also highly unlikely - especially if she goes as far as jumping into bed with him to begin with.\n\nReddit seriously needs to chill.", "This right here, I think our tones are lost in translation. We call them boys and we say it with disdain, disappointment, and derision to their faces in an attempt to make a point with them. It does not translate very well online.", "That in and of itself is wrong though. Being a boy doesn't automatically make you toxic, cruel, ECT. Using it as an insult just furthers the \"boys will be boys\" crap we use to justify bad behavior. \n\nWe just need to call it what it is, toxic humans being toxic.

It\u2019s a catch-22 but better to be safe than sorry/guilty.", "NTA, I'd have done the same exact thing.", "NTA. They\u2019re gross and pathetic and she needed to know.", "OP, you did the right thing and those two who denied they made a bet and said you were stirring drama are just chicken shxt that don't know a thing about accountability and they just want to get away with it.  \n\nI am pretty sure Conny appreciated you for telling her what was going on.  Nobody wants to be the unknowingly participant of a bet.", ">I mean, what do they expect. Going out and drinking. You may not find the best of society at such places.\n\nThat's a bit puritanical and victim-blamey, the issue isn't that they were out drinking. These were the birthday girls friends, hand picked and invited, not some randos they encountered at a bar. They know these people whether they're in church, in a library, or out drinking. Conny, Josh, and the wager makers all know each other from work and hang out in their off time. I think we all expect our friends not to pull this kind of crap, that's when they stop being friends.", "> Also idk if I\u2019m allowed to edit my post \n\nYou can edit your post.", "I don\u2019t see Tom Brady or Payton manning going out to bars and getting into drama.\n\nThere should be an expectation of dealing with wack ppl.", "Ah I see, I may have read that post once upon a time, idk. Tbh I think that no matter the reasoning behind it, be it jealousy that guys like that get \ud83d\ude3a or that it's simply because you think the behavior is gross is good enough reason to tell the other person. I'd think the same if it was the other way around too.\n\nReddit is well... Reddit.", "Thank you for your input u/IDrinkMyOwnSemen", "You're welcome. Always a pleasure to offer my $0.02 words of wisdom.", "Okay that's a fair point. Hmmm, boys is out, I'm going to be honest I'm good with toxic, but not humans. I want them to understand they are less than human when they think and behave like this. Got any other thoughts? I am completely serious.", "Just don\u2019t interact with them if you feel the need to go that far. It doesn\u2019t matter how right you are, there\u2019s literally no point in wasting your time trying to insult someone, because they\u2019re just going to get more defensive. It\u2019s a normal *human* reaction to get at least a little defensive if someone starts insulting them. \n\nYou can call someone out without insulting them, and if that doesn\u2019t work move on and stop associating with them.", "Primates instead of humans. They can be toxic primates.", "NTA. You seem decent. Find nee friends asap who respect hard truths", "NTA.

You did a good thing warning her about those creeps.", "if two adults consent to go home with one another, it is what it is.

OP is still very much NTA but I think the title is misleading, it wasn't about which guy Conny would be going home with, it was about whether their friend Josh would be able to take her home with him (still a very childish and dehumanizing bet). Josh seemed upset at the bet but we can't know if he was upset about his friends being jerks or upset about the fact that he lost his chance with Conny. My guess is both.", "OP says Josh wasn't there when the bet was made so it sounds like he wasn't, but that's an unknown for sure factor.", "Also, the majority of teenage boys I know (and I admit I'm biased) are great kids who don't deserve some old man's poor feeling management thrust onto them. The kids I know help me with my lawncare, buy their parents treats on the way home...\n\nTeenagers get such a harsh rap and ngl I think the harsh rap is what makes some act out. Might as well, if people are comparing grown men's behaviours to you as an age, not even as a person. And if grown folk get to act like that and be called children, why can't children?", "Being an opportunistic creep is not the same as being a good samaritan. Sounds like he warned her about two creeps, including himself, which was a good act but does not make him a good person\n\nLike what role do his feelings have in that conversation?

Get ready because I'm about to blow your mind.\n\nBeing disgusted by seeing a man like that successfully be able lure women under false pretenses does not make someone a creep. And I also have news for you - having that disgust further fueled by their own failures in that department despite that they would never dream of doing anything like that, does not make him one either - no matter how irrationally repulsed you are by it.\n\nIn fact, it's a perfectly valid reason - hence, feelings. I get that it's something Reddit loves to invalidate though given its association, but just like them, you're wrong on that.\n\nHe can still be a good samaritan, as long as that's not the sole reason he's doing it. Plus, even if it was further fueled by that reason, that's not at all the same as having an ulterior motive to get with her.. He could still have his actions and disgust be fueled by that without having any interest in getting with her - her just wants to see the other guy put in his place and fail. Should he not?\n\n\nNow if he was demanding favors from this person after the fact and then throwing a fit when he didn't get them, THEN you can go ahead and throw that word around that you love because that would indeed invalidate his samaritan status. But simply having feelings that help fuel certain actions is perfectly fine - as long as he doesn't see them as conditional or transactional.

That makes them creeps", "They don't want him to be the victim. Guilty until proven innocent  it seems", "See my edit above about expecting rewards. But no, it's not and you're still wrong - it's only a creep if he expects something in return and gets angry when he didn't get it.\n\nBut also in the above scenario he wasn't necessarily 'lobbying for himself' to the other people involved, he was just telling Reddit one thing that happened to be going through his mind during the incident when making the post.\n\nImagine being okay with a woman being deceived or even abused because the person potentially putting an end to it happened to be 'opportunistic'.", "Once again, that's where you're wrong, a good samaritan can indeed feel those things.\n\nFeeling those things might be unattractive to you and that's perfectly valid, but it doesn't negate their samaritanship - as long as they don't care whether they're \"appreciated\" and more about taking the jerks down, regardless of what happens to them. Even if jealousy is a factor, he's allowed to feel both that and disgust.\n\nThey aren't mutually exclusive here, which seems to be the big thing that you're missing. It would appear that most people's biggest issue in being unable to see this is thinking that they are.", "You\u2019ve probably heard it here in some form, when people tell on themselves, listen. If he thought it was important enough to be the only reason he talked about, it probably was. It\u2019s incel behaviour. He didn\u2019t pick one random thought out of a huge and mixed array. That\u2019s what he wanted, and he wanted her to appreciate him for what he did, not those other men who act like jerks. \n\nHaving bad motivations for doing things does change the context. If OP told her friend what she did because if she went home with no one she would win the bet by default she would also be TA (along with everyone else on the bet). \n\nI think what\u2019s going on is that you\u2019ve internalised one meaning of \u2018expect\u2019 so what other people would describe as an expectation doesn\u2019t meet your bar and therefore he wasn\u2019t being creepy. But no, you can be creepy as fuck without expecting anything. Pickup artist culture is all about playing a numbers game and expecting nothing and it\u2019s creepy as shit.", "Imagine being okay with a woman being deceived or even abused because the person potentially putting an end to it happened to be an 'opportunistic creep' in your eyes.\n\nThat certainly sounds like it's what you're saying. Guess he should sit back and let it happen because it's upsetting him for what you deem to be the 'wrong reasons'.\n\nLet that sink in for a second."]}
