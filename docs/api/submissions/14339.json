Stop making excuses for your son's behaviour and take responsibility.", "There\u2019s not enough info. Did he trip or accidentally fall into her? Or did he purposely push her and was surprised when she got hurt?", "YTA - damn, your 17 year old son slammed a 14 year old girl he knew was vulnerable and you're asking this question?\n\nIt wasn't an \"accident\" - he's freaking 17.\n\nUnless he has a developmental disorder there's absolutely no excuse. \n\nIf he was a decent kid he would have been looking out for her, not attacking her.\n\nYou are an asshole for even trying to justify his behavior.", "Unless he's pushing her out of the way of oncoming traffic, theres no situation on earth where its reasonable for a 17 year old male to \"accidentally\" push a 14 y old female so hard her head hits the concrete. Let alone one with disabilities. \n\nIf this was in a sporting game he'd still have to leave the field. Instead it's an EASTER EGG HUNT.", "If your 17 year old kid cannot restrain himself around someone with physical and mental disabilities then you\u2019ve got bigger problems. He\u2019s 17 ffs and should be able to know when and who to settle down around.", "Feel like this is a yta because alot if info is missing.\nLike how dit a 17 year old slam down a 14 old in a egg hunt", "YTA\n\nWhen you say previously nobody's \"really\" been hurt in this \"free-for-all,\" it seems like \"really\" is doing heavy lifting. The fact that the rest of your family has decided your almost adult son is too rough to be around the rest of the family makes me think there's some missing reasons here related to close calls at previous gatherings.\n\nAn Easter egg hunt where the kids were specifically warned against roughhousing shouldn't end with a physically vulnerable child being knocked down and concussed. Yes, accidents happen. But some of them happen because people choose to ignore warnings and behave reasonably. 17 seems old enough to understand this.", "After I read the title, I was with you. After you explained how the hunts were split into age groups, I was definitely on your side. \n\nWhen you outlined that the 14 year old was physically and mentally disabled, I faltered, but thought \u201cmaybe her son\u2019s really young\u201d. \n\nThen you reveal your \u201cchild\u201d is actually a young adult of 17 AND your poor niece\u2019s head was slammed into a pavement; and I say \u201cslammed\u201d because a simple fall wouldn\u2019t usually result in a concussion. \n\nHow have you not reprimanded your son for assaulting his cousin? It doesn\u2019t even sound like he apologised. \n\nYou, my dear are 100% the AH because you haven\u2019t taught your son a modicum of self restraint and even now, you don\u2019t think he did anything wrong. \n\nYTA", "ESH. Dear god, SOMEBODY make rules for these children. You essentially just said you let a bunch of teenagers have an all-out bloodsport battle for plastic eggs. Your \"kid\" is 17. An adult practically. He should know better than to shove a 14 year-old so hard she falls down (again over PLASTIC EGGS). \n\nThat said, it sounds like no one in the family has ever talked to these kids about respect, teamwork, or personal safety. You are right, he shouldn't have let her participate if he knew they all acted like monsters like that.\n\nWhat your family NEEDS to do is gather all the older \"kids\" discuss what happened, have your kid apologize (since I never heard you say that he did and that is what you do when somebody is hurt by you. Accident or not.), and set some serious ground rules for how the kids \"play\" together from now on. \n\nAlso, I don't know you or your kid, but if the entire family is suddenly coming to you saying he is too violent, then it sounds like this isn't the first time he's hurt someone, just the first time he hurt them this seriously. I'd have a talk with some of the family members about why they feel this way. If it really was a one time accident, then give him the chance to redeem himself by reigning it in and proving it really was a mistake. If this is a repeating pattern however (i.e. other kids in the family have been hurt by him) the I suggest you take more responsibility with your child and figure out where all this aggression (directed at younger kids especially) is coming from.\n\nNobody is perfect in this situation, but I think there's a lot more to unpack here than just \"should I punish him for what happened\". This is definitely a family council, talk-it-out kind of deal.", "17 year old has no empathy. Wonder where he learnt that.", "INFO - Does your son have a history of injuring brothers/sisters/cousins/etc., not limited to this specific Easter event?", "YTA because you admitted your son basically did it on purpose and he probably learned that sociopathy from you, but all the adults kind of suck here for allowing what basically seems like a Hunger Games style Easter Egg hunt to go on amongst teenagers. They are too old for that.", "Yta she\u2019s never done the hunt before so couldn\u2019t imagine how intense it would be. If she got knocked over so hard she got a concussion and you think your son isn\u2019t to blame is disgusting. Your kids are acting stupid getting that rough over an easter egg hunt", "YTA. If you want to have a big rugby scrum wrestling free-for-all, maybe it should be 18 and over and the adult participants should sign liability waivers. But DON'T allow your 17yo son to \"play rough\" with everyone 12 and over! This is an Easter egg hunt, not a survivor-situation.", "Yta", "YTA.  It\u2019s not like this is two small children playing rough.  Your son is a year away from being a legal adult, he absolutely should know better.  He caused a serious injury to someone.  Stop excusing his behavior, that is problematic.  At the very least, you should be paying her medical bills, and your son should face some kind of serious consequence for his lack of judgement.", "Edit: Changed to YTA after OP clarified elsewhere that this was closer to on purpose. \n\n~~INFO:~~ What were the specific circumstances of the accident? A lot of this turns on the extent to which your son was being aggressive.  \n\nObviously it matters some that she's participating, but only to an extent. There's definitely a level of being rough that would make your son TA. At the same time, if he was being careful and just (say) accidentally bumped into her, then he wouldn't be the AH.", "What the hell kind of \u00e0 Easter egg Hunt is this ? \n\nESH. Y'all need to grow up.", "All the adults suck here. Allie should have been placed with one of the younger groups rather than the hunger games event that her age group does and your son and the others should have known better to be more gentle with her.", "ESH and INFO, as it may change some things\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone to have events at your house. If you don\u2019t want to host, you don\u2019t have to. But you should really think about your why. \n\nYour brother also can\u2019t dictate whether or not your son is allowed at family gathering. He can say \u201cmy family and I won\u2019t be there if your son is\u201d, but he can\u2019t forbid it, especially if you\u2019re the host. You don\u2019t have to boot your own kid from his home to have your relatives over. \n\nHowever, you didn\u2019t really tell us what happened. How does a (able-bodied?) 17M accidentally hit a 14F w/disabilities hard enough that she hits her head on concrete and gets a concussion? Did he fall into her, body check her, not see her and trample her? I\u2019m kind of confused. If you didn\u2019t see it that\u2019s one thing, but it kind of feels (intentionally) glossed over. Especially since we was reminded just prior to the event. \n\nAlso, are you sure your brother got others on his side, or did they see what happened and just agreed? Your brother\u2019s reaction seems to imply he thought it was intentional. Is that accurate?\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re thinking about next year, it would be a moot point, right? Your kid will be 18 & thus ineligible, no?", "Ahh yes, the classic 'they all play rough and boys will be boys' bullshit. All that does is empower young men to act like complete idiots/assholes because 'they're still growing and dont know their own strength' or the classic 'they're in puberty, they dont have control of their hormones'.\n\nThere is a little thing called parenting, it's meant to bring up the younger generations to be helpful members of society. All you're teaching your son by not even making him apologize for being rough with a 14 year old disabled girl, is that it's fine to bully people.\n\nTldr: yta, and your son is well on his way to being an asshole in training.\n\nEdit: the fact you classify people being pissed at you and afraid of your son as 'family bullshit'. Yeah, double the asshole.", "ESH. You basically raised a clan of monsters and then got angry one of the monsters acted like a monster.\n\nI sense that you in particular are a massive enabler of your son as well lol. Like, he was told to be careful. It \u2018slipped his mind\u2019? Are you dumb or he is dumb, or are you both just pretending?", "YTA for the simple fact that you seem to get off on kids hurting each other.. like who in their right mind sets up age bracket Easter egg rumbles.\n\nYour son is also a major AH, his almost 18 and enjoy hurting young girls.. big red flag and hopefully he doesn\u2019t get into any relationships in the future, they wouldn\u2019t be safe around him.", "ESH - with Allie in the picture everyone, should have collectively reevaluated this WWEaster Egg Hunt tradition. She is part of the family, maybe there is a new inclusive tradition, or the age ranges shift or are more flexible. Maybe it is not a free for all?\n\nI\u2019m not sure anyone truly was looking out for Allie. You also said it was a free for all. Even if you talked to the children there were no established boundaries. I wouldn\u2019t put that on the 17 year old assuming it was an accident (also, no real information was given on the accident)", "ESH, \n\n1. what sort of plonker allows their disabled child to participate in what is almost a royal rumble. \n\n2. How did your son knock allie to the ground?  Bump  by accident? Deliberate shove? Body slam? \n\n3. Reaction by all after sucks if this was an accident.\n Reaction if it was deliberate..... maybe justified.", "YTA because that's not normal roughness.", "Honestly, you and your family sound like a bunch of a h. Not just because I don\u2019t like teens that don\u2019t know their own forces, but because you turn everything into a match instead of a team effort. Even when there is a kid with special needs amongst you. \n\nWhy is it that your kids feel the need to win an Easter hunt. Wouldn\u2019t just catching them all, as a team, have been  a more festive outcome? One that enables the less physicals to joy the party as well? \nBecause apparently, the moment you start with prices, your son changes into a bowling ball, that knocks everybody down just to get his win\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t concern you? That doesn\u2019t make you think that you might have been a bit too much of a pusher instead of someone who cares? That doesn\u2019t rethink you that maybe your 17 year old has to learn about collaborating instead of bowling?", "YTA yes accidents happen but for a 17 year old to give someone a concussion is not just an accident,he must have knocked her pretty hard,  did he help her up and apologize ? did he check if she was hurt ?", "look if you want a bjj match i\u2019m down.\n\nbut maybe don\u2019t put one for kids 12 and up??\n\na 17y male is very different from a 12y girl\u2026..", "I don't understand how an Easter egg hunt gets rough. Sorry, but your 17 year old son needs to be more considerate. An Easter egg hunt should not involve anyone getting a concussion let alone a child with disabilities. That's ridiculous!", "What kind of Easter Egg hunt leaves people with injuries?!\n\nI\u2019m gonna say ESH for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Your son knocked over Allie. However, based on your description, rough play is apparently the nature of the game. Your brother did instruct everyone to play soft, but based on your account I\u2019m assuming that your son isn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t abide by that, so it\u2019s unfair to put all the blame on him.\n2. You just brush of the injuries of a little girl. One that never was an equal player to begin with.\n3. Telling you to punish your son is overreaching, regardless whether punishment is appropriate or not. Also demanding to exclude your son from future events is taking it too far.\n\nThis judgement builds on the assumption that your son didn\u2019t behave any differently than the other players and this is the first incident of this kind, though.", "Your 17 year old is overly aggressive.

Why couldn\u2019t your almost fully grown son control the physicality against someone clearly smaller and more vulnerable? \n\nA concussion is actually super serious and not the trivial thing you\u2019re making it out to be. He absolutely deserves to be punished for not being able to control his physicality. \n\nThat being said, not allowing him to come to family gatherings is a stretch.

Anyone else wondering how many times OPs son has 'played rough' with other kids in the family, but just didn't cause any significant injury so it hasn't been addressed before now.", "that he didn't apologise is also adding to the normalisation of violence. It's not just about his potential partners, it's about how he will respond to gender based violence in general", "My abusive ex was bi and this was his MO actually: Women and femme/smaller queer guys in our community. To his 'guy' friends he seemed like a nice guy, but then he'd get drunk and force himself on others who weren't in a position to fight back. Ask any one of his straight guy friends about him though, and they'd say he's a saint.", "Come on, dont be like that\nConsequence free violence is always bad, it is not gender specific..", "That is such a ridiculous string of assumptions. You think that just by the very fact that a male hurt  female in any way, even if it was an accident  that it will normalise consequence-free male violence and ENSURE they will be increasingly violent to EVERY female partner they have? That is unbelievably innapropriate.", "Easter hunt is not a sport", "personality changes like self awareness maybe?how many 17 y.o do you know are completely cool calm and always in control of themselves", "Probably. \n\n\"Lets cash-incentivize our kids to trample each other!\"\n\nBrilliant idea.", "Easter egg fight club", "Because if an almost adult can push a 14 year old child with a disability and not have the balls to apologize he will not have the balls to go against someone his size.", "You got that right lmao", "were you there listening to everthing OP said in the moment ?", "Exactly right.  One wonders what happens in OP\u2019s home.", "I beg your pardon but I didn\u2019t say that consequence-free violence is ever not bad.  \n\nPartner violence is, by its very nature, gender specific to the sexual orientation of the abuser, and future violence against partners due to the normalization of gendered violence now is what I\u2019m specifically talking about.  I won\u2019t be entering into any arguments about it and certainly won\u2019t be arguing about what I did not say.", "Are you seriously trying to mansplain gendered violence to someone who very clearly seems to be female.... are you really that unaware or is it willful ignorance? Come on mate, you're embarrassing all of us", "I said the reasons are the same. On average, boys are stronger and more aggressive than girls. Because testosterone. You can't infer simple logic?", "How many 17 year olds I know that wouldn't slam an actual child into a pavement? Most of them. If at 17 you are this violent the miniscule brain changes aren't gonna do much.", "That makes no sense whatsoever - I think it's you who needs to experience the real world if that's the way you believe people actually are. That's the sort of fairy tale we tell kids.", "You've got no basis for that conjecture. It's just as likely that if he pushes people he really shouldn't remorselessly he will have no problem doing it to anyone.", "..\n\nLol OP that's your main account, isn't it?", "lol do you see how loaded you make it sound? how do u know he body slammed her from the top rope?\n\nor maybe, just MAYBE,  he accidentally bumped her and she fell bcos shes not fully able bodied\n\nonly 3 year age difference so shes basically and adult too right? /s", "So he sounds like a mentally unstable young man who needs to see a therapist either way Wait until he gets into the real world and tries it with somebody bigger and badder. It will be hilarious", "LOL Totally. you got me dagnabbit.\n\nim sick of people on this sub assigning intent to people, especially with such certainty and malice", "I feel we need/deserve more details.  But damn, your comment is spot on.", "it's hard to believe it was a genuine accident, especially after the warning to everyone in the beginning."]}
