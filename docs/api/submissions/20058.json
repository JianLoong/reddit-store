You need to go to great length to make sure this never happens again.", "NTA: your cousin needs to watch a few serial killer documentaries, listen to the news more and read a few newspaper articles about psycho/sociopaths. \n\nNo one can be that ignorant in 2023.

She is really naive to think she'd be able to get to a phone if that guy had ill intentions, and she put both of you at risk. No on needs to #notallmen me, but the reality is that the bad guys do not have any way to distinguish themselves from the good guys until it's too late. TBH, I'd say the same thing if she opened the door to a strange woman, too. There are ways to help strangers that minimize the risk to yourself, and she's lucky she didn't get burned this time.", "NTA.

While you're out there, make sure you show her a few horror movies because it seems like she's never watched one.", "NTA. Some people have zero awareness of their situation. Your cousin ain\u2019t in the city. An outstanding response time for that situation would be 5-10 minutes. I called an ambulance to my house in a similarly rural location, it took a half hour. You are own your own for a bit. You have to be prepared to take care of yourself. \n\nI would explain this to her when you were more awake. Sure, most times it\u2019s just somebody in need of help.

I would be SO pissed off if my cousin did something like this. I\u2019m a woman and also do everything in my power to be cautious and wary of people especially if I\u2019m home alone?

Your cousin has no survival instinct at all", "NTA, and good God I hope she doesn't become a lawyer, that level of naivety is kinda staggering. Literally, my 12 year old has more sense than that.", "NTA.

Statistically, it is far more likely that he's a good guy with shitty timing than that he was up to something dangerous.\n\nBut you can't tell until it's too late. MOST people who aren't dangerous GET THAT and aren't dicks about you protecting yourself. In fact, if someone is a dick about you protecting yourself, that' s a pretty good sign that you need to keep protecting yourself.\n\nExample: My parents lived in a rural area pretty similar to what you described. I was at home alone for Christmas break - young woman, home alone, at night, while my parents were out at a quiz night at the pub with their friends. This was about a decade ago, we relied heavily on the landline, but we also had cell phones that were expensive to use. For some reason, I picked up the landline to call someone - and there was no dial tone. A few minutes later, a strange man was knocking on my door, and there was a van in my driveway. It was winter in Canada, about 8:30 or 9 at night, and dark and cold as hell.\n\nWithout opening the door, I called out to ask him who he was, and he told me he was from the phone company making repairs. I was terrified. I hadn't even known the phone NEEDED repairs until a few minutes ago, and nobody had called in to report a problem with the phone line. KEEPING THE DOOR LOCKED I told him I was just going to call the owner of the house to verify that everything was ok - and here's the kicker, the point - he cheerfully said, \"Sure, no problem ma'am, I'll wait while you make your calls. Here's my Bell Canada Employee Number\"\n\nI called my dad on the cell to ask if he had called in a repair, and he had NOT. He was also terrified. He and his friends were paying the bill and getting into the car to come to me immediately - probably about a 30 minute drive - while my mum called Bell Canada to find out if they really had sent someone out.\n\nTurns out, they had. The lines were down all over the neighbourhood, they were checking all the houses along the line, they gave the (matching) employee number to the guy who was in my driveway, and told us that he should be able to do the work without coming into the house. My dad still got in the car to come meet me and him, and I opened the door with a cup of hot coffee to see him getting to work on the access box outside the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE STILL WAS NOT ANGRY, PUT OUT, ANNOYED, OR RUDE ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HAD NOT UNLOCKED THE DOOR. He thanked me for the coffee, shook my father's hand when he arrived, and cheerfully said good night to both of us.\n\nANYBODY who kicks up a fuss because you want to yell through the locked door to help them with directions or make a phone call for them? You call the police immediately. Your cousin could have offered help to this guy without putting either of you at risk by opening that door, and if the guy was reasonable, he would have absolutely understood why a young woman (anybody, really, but especially a young woman) was doing that.\n\nNTA - the chances are that the guy had zero malicious intentions, but the stakes are too high, you can't tell until it's too late.", "Forensic Files is always on repeat somewhere, also it's on Prime. Sit down with your cousin and explain that she's a moron who nearly fed you both to a potential wolf.

It's a bit of a ridiculous response to an unusual situation.

If they're living in a community, your point would make sense. This isn't one.", ">Feeling tired, I told her that she couldn't open the door without consulting me anymore (admittedly, my tone might have been a little rude).\n\nNo that's what he said.", ">After he left, I told my cousin that she should not be opening the door to random strangers in the middle of the night.\n\nDid you miss this part.  OP did tell her that. To which she replied with\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She argued that she thought he genuinely needed help. I explained to her that it wasn't a valid reason since we had no idea who this guy was or what he might try to do. She then suggested that she could have called the police if he had done anything (completely missing the point about response times in our area).\n\nIf I heard such stupid justification and an inability to understand why it was requested of her not to open doors to strangers. I too would consider her unable to make sound judgement in such situation and demand her to inform me before opening the door. Because that is what a smart adult would have done anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeck, if this was me and my younger cousin is sleeping. I would inform her of the person outside before interacting with the stranger. \n\nWhy, because it doesn't matter if I am the man or the larger/older person. A gun, knife or even a heavy blunt object would incapacitate me easily if I am careless. This would put her in danger without the ability to save herself and also me."]}
