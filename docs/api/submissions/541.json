We were mostly just sitting and chatting, nothing crazy. My friend was the one hosting the party so some people in attendance were more of my acquaintances rather than friends but it\u2019s obviously not a big deal and we all get along just fine.\n\nThe night was going great and I was chatting with a few people and I don\u2019t even remember how it came to be but my friend mentioned that I started learning Spanish recently. It turned out one of the people (Abby) spoke decent Spanish and started a small talk in Spanish, basically, how are you, etc. We exchanged maybe 2 or 3 sentences as I\u2019ve only been learning it for a month. We switched back to English and Abby (now, keep in mind, we are all white and live in Europe) asked if there was a reason why I didn\u2019t learn the \u2018standard\u2019 Spanish accent people are taught in school here (we\u2019re in England although I am not English). I simply replied that no but I was focusing on this one specifically because Argentinian telenovelas are my guilty pleasure and I am learning Spanish to be able to watch them (I learned English to read books so it\u2019s nothing new to me) and I figured it was best to focus on that from the beginning since pronunciation differs quite a lot (think choosing to learn Australian English over RP English) and you're able to hear it even in the most basic sentences.\n\nAt this point another person (Stella) chimed in and said that she thought it was cultural appropriation to only learn a language to watch TV. I replied that I disagree, and if anything, it was cultural appreciation, learning a language to appreciate country\u2019s culture, even if it's watching TV or movies.\nShe basically disagreed with me and asked if I was even planning on visiting Argentina or Latin America and I replied that I currently have no plans but who knows what the future holds and that when I was learning English I didn\u2019t plan on moving to the UK either. (Honestly, I want to move there but didn\u2019t feel like explaining myself to her) At this point, she said that she changed her mind, that it wasn\u2019t cultural appropriation that I was a racist to learn a language with specific dialect/accent and not even planning on visiting the country.\n\nI\u2019ve had enough of her at that point and simply told her to fuck off and ignored her and changed the conversation topic.\n\nNow, apparently, Stella has been telling people how awfully I treated her when she only tried to show me that I was in the wrong. So am I the asshole for telling her to fuck off?", "created_utc": 1667150948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhkbj0/aita_for_telling_a_girl_to_duck_off_after_she/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Almost everything I hear about cultural appropriation or anything similar to it, is all white people telling other white people how to act. (And I say this as a white person). \n\nStella is an idiot. I will say, that as good as it probably felt to have told her to F off, you probably would\u2019ve been better to have just wrapped it up by saying something like \u201cwell, I understand that\u2019s you\u2019re opinion, we\u2019ll agree to disagree\u201d and then immediately change the subject & ignore her. Because it was your friends party and these people were more her friends & your acquaintances, you probably could\u2019ve handled it better that way than just telling her to F off. But we all know why you went the other route, and we still say NTA. By the way, that whole comment about Stella \u201ctelling people how awfully I treated her when she only tried to **show me that I was in the wrong**\u201d that comment says everything. It\u2019s not her responsibility to go and show people how wrong they all are. Just brush the whole thing off and don\u2019t worry about what she says.

Like, is it racist or cultural appropriation to learn a dead language? Too many idiots out there...", "I thought the same thing!", "That\u2019s how I learned Japanese when I was younger.

So I watched movies in English, comics, games and series, even with English subtitles, so I did the listening and the reading at the same time.
