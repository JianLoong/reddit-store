At 25 I left my home country to work abroad, and my dad met R (67f) within the same year.\n\nI got married to my husband (34m) 5 years ago, and we live in his home country. When our son was born almost 4 years ago, I gave R the title of grandmother to my child. \n3 years ago, my dad and R got married. \nR has two children with her late husband, both in their 40s (m+f).\n\nLast year, Rs son had his first child and a month later we had our second. It was decided that my dad and R would travel to visit her son and then come to us on their way back in January. \n\nMy dad and I share a passion for gardening, so I took him and R to see my local garden shop. \nI introduced one of the owners to my dad and R. My exact words were :\"This is my dad, and his wife, R\". \nAll good, they exchange hellos and we leave. \n\nThat night, after a few glasses of wine, R decided to tell me that she was hurt and offended by how I introduced her. Surprised by this I asked her to explain. She refused but also would not let it go. \nEventually, she stated she wanted to be called mom. \n\nI tried to be nice and explain to her that this was not going to happen. I have a mom, and we are incredibly close. I told her that I believe I gave her a higher title, grandmother. \n\nThis was not good enough and she pressed the issue, and eventually got onto wanting a higher title than my mom. Her reasoning: she can financially give my children more than either of my parents can. She is very wealthy, while my parents are not.\nI told her that my kids and I don't want or need her money. \n\nAgain this wasn't good enough, and she would not let it go. It went around in circles for a few hours and a lot more was said regarding her relationship with her own mom and her daughter. \n\nI eventually went outside to cool down, as I had become increasingly agitated by all this and I was trying to keep the conversation respectful and find a resolution. \nThere was none, as when I got back inside she had gone to bed. \n\nI had through this situation, asked my dad not to get involved, as this was an issue between her and I. He agreed she was out of line though. \n\nThings were obviously tense the rest of their visit, even though she claimed in private to my dad that she didnt remember anything. \nThey left, and I haven't heard from her since. \n\nMy dad and I are good, I apologized to him for my part in it all and anything said that hurt him. \n\nI plan to go home in about a month with my 2 kids. Ofourse I will see my dad and R, and I anticipate it being awkward. So this has been coming back to me a lot in the lead up to my trip. I wonder if this is a thing and if I'm being disrespectful. \nI have lost a lot of respect for R because of her bringing her money into things, but she is very good to my dad and brother who lives near them.\n\nSo I wanted to know if IATA for refusing to give my dad's wife the title of mom (or higher)?\n\nEdit. Paragraphs\n\nEdit to add some information regarding the grandparent titles and my own mom. \nWhere I come from we speak multiple languages. My mom speaks language A (English) so she is grandmother in English, but also chose her own grandparent name. My dad and his wife speak language B, so are grandfather and grandmother in language B. \nMy mom does not have issue with this in any way.", "created_utc": 1680348557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128jipy/aita_wont_call_dads_wife_mom/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
