The office setting is really chill and everyone is really fun\n\nWell anyways, there is a pool party coming up in two weeks for the company, everyone and their families are invited, but we have to give a headcount a week before the party.\n\nWell, last night I got home, and I knew my fiance (30m) hadn't had the best day, so I asked him how it went and he vented to me and everything was fine. We were laughing, we had ordered some delicious takeout and ate dinner, everything was going really good. Until I mentioned the pool party.\n\nI was very excited about it, and I started off with proposing that we both go, told him what it entailed and that I wanted to go. Well he didn't want to go, but I do so I told him that I would be going regardless, I wanted him to come with me but if he doesn't want to go then that's fine. Well he got upset.\n\nThis is a problem we've had the year we've been together, and it's been a constant battle with him to get him to understand that I'm not going to cheat on him like his past relationships have. But I am tired, it has been a year of me being everything a loving girlfriend and now fiance should be, and he still has these insecurities to the point that he's willing to ruin my plans.\n\nWell, longer story short, we fought for a bit, I raised my voice, but in the end I just told him to forget I said anything and that I won't be going. We went to bed angry (this is only the second time that has happened)\n\nThis morning, he rolled over and said he was sorry and that he \"didn't want me to be mad at him\". I felt like this was just brushing over what happened , and he snapped and asked if I just wanted to keep fighting but before I could answer, he got up to get ready and made a comment about how he's miserable at work and when he comes home it's the \"same fucking thing\".\n\nI know that I shouldn't let him dictate what I do just because he's insecure, but at the same time I can't help but wonder if I actually am just making things worse?\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nso, i have been reading all of you guy's comments, and Ive come to a conclusion.\n\nI actually talked with my coworkers and the party is being rescheduled for a night that im always busy anyways, and it was a birthday party for the office bitch no one likes so i don't even actually want to go anymore\n\nas for my fiance, he called me to apologize. he said he'd been unreasonable and that he knows it's wrong of him to want me to change who i am, and even wants to take me out to the local amusement park this weekend! this was all before I even told him what happened with the party\n\nthings aren't perfect, we definitely have a lot to talk about when we get home, but I'm hopeful.\n\n\nAlso, Reddit, please realize that bad people aren't bad out right, or just for funsies, and i know that my love was never a bad person, he just had some terrible circumstances and needs love and acceptance and patience and honestly I don't give a fuck if it takes a while, I will be here for this man when he needs me, and I know he will be there for me if I need him.", "created_utc": 1685708490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yb6x0/aita_for_wanting_to_go_to_a_pool_party/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he has an issue, you can explain that he has an opportunity to go with you if he has anxiety or fear of cheating, but that you will be going and that his fears are unfounded and not fair to you.
