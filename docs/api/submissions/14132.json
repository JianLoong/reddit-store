My mom said \u201cSince its at my house, I get the say.\u201d I called my mom and told her to cancel the flowers. Then, my mom called me from a restaurant the other day asking for my credit card number because she was ordering all the food. I assumed she was ordering everything we had previously discussed. But no, she was at a completely different restaurant, we had been planning on tacos and my mom ordered greek food.\n\nLast night was the final straw. Kate\u2019s 95 year old grandparents decided they want to come, but with bad weather and their age, we want to move the ceremony from the yard to the deck.

Congratulations on your marriage!", "NTA, and get rid of the friends who think that you need to cowtow to your mother about any of this. You didn't want a wedding in the first place, the thing you did to placate your mother was to have one at all. That was very generous of you.

Honestly I think you should take this as a reason to never involve your mom in planning an event again since it seems like in her mind \u201cinvolved in planning\u201d translates to \u201ctaking over completely\u201d. Even the (extremely reasonable) request to move the wedding to the deck to accommodate grandparents was overruled, which to me seems less about her \u201cwedding vision\u201d and more so about her needing to control everything \n\nI\u2019m amazed that you and Kate put up with it as long as you did. The most important part of a wedding is that the BRIDE and GROOM are happy.

You should do it elsewhere, so it can be to your liking and without your mother ruining the preparations.", "NTA. Everyone says her house, her decision, so if you cancel, that no longer applies. You agreed to a small wedding there as a favor to your parents; you didn\u2019t agree to give up all control of your wedding. Besides all this, your mother said awful things to you.

We did the same thing as you. We canceled our wedding 5 months before and eloped early. It got to be too much. Too much money and too much pressure to factor in what other people in the family wanted. 2 weeks out is a bit short notice, but I can understand how hard it is to be true to yourself but once you are, you\u2019re free. \n\nTake the loss, pay back what expenses your mom may have incurred and be happy with your new bride.

You are so NTA and you have demonstrated that you\u2019ll put your fianc\u00e9e first now and in the future, that message is priceless. Your Mum, respectfully, sounds pretty toxic and overbearing. Should you want to continue the relationship, you\u2019ll need to have some firm boundaries. This is x1000 if you decide to have children. Again, well done.", "NTA. You mother is pushy and controlling. She tried to take over and now she doesn't even get to be a part of the wedding. That's 100% on her for trying to overrule.", "NTA. Older Generations with more traditional values have a different view of marriage in every aspect and then also includes the principles of its value to the family in terms of ceremony and celebration. It needs to be a dying tradition in my opinion because a marriage is between the two people involved and of the celebration can be whatever those two people want. That said you do not want to have a big over the top celebration so do not have one because it is about you and your soon to be wife no one else.", "NTA. At all", "NTA and you're being an excellent future husband. \n\nIs your mother like this often?", "NTA.  You were only having the thing because it meant something to the family.
