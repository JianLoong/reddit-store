My mom said \u201cSince its at my house, I get the say.\u201d I called my mom and told her to cancel the flowers. Then, my mom called me from a restaurant the other day asking for my credit card number because she was ordering all the food. I assumed she was ordering everything we had previously discussed. But no, she was at a completely different restaurant, we had been planning on tacos and my mom ordered greek food.\n\nLast night was the final straw. Kate\u2019s 95 year old grandparents decided they want to come, but with bad weather and their age, we want to move the ceremony from the yard to the deck.

You agreed to a small wedding there as a favor to your parents; you didn\u2019t agree to give up all control of your wedding. Besides all this, your mother said awful things to you.

We did the same thing as you. We canceled our wedding 5 months before and eloped early. It got to be too much. Too much money and too much pressure to factor in what other people in the family wanted. 2 weeks out is a bit short notice, but I can understand how hard it is to be true to yourself but once you are, you\u2019re free. \n\nTake the loss, pay back what expenses your mom may have incurred and be happy with your new bride.

You are so NTA and you have demonstrated that you\u2019ll put your fianc\u00e9e first now and in the future, that message is priceless. Your Mum, respectfully, sounds pretty toxic and overbearing.

You mother is pushy and controlling. She tried to take over and now she doesn't even get to be a part of the wedding. That's 100% on her for trying to overrule.", "NTA. Older Generations with more traditional values have a different view of marriage in every aspect and then also includes the principles of its value to the family in terms of ceremony and celebration.

You didn't ask and then she agreed as a favor for you.\n\n And now she's running roughshod over all of your wishes for you own wedding.\n\nBut, let's imagine an alternate universe that your friends and BIL seem to inhabit where that's appropriate for her to do because she's the \"host.\"\n\nNow, you made her not the host. Problem solved. NTA", "You are extremely NTA! I'm proud of you for standing up to your mother!", "NTA and sorry, but your mother sounds terrible. I am foreseeing a lot of distance from her in the future.", "Nta- you will probably find your tribe on r/JustNoFamily r/estrangedadultchildren\n\nHugs\nYou did the exact right thing by standing up to your mother.", "You don't owe your mom an apology and you're NTA.  \n\nYour BIL can let your mom plan his wedding.", "NTA.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSince its at my house, I get the say!?!\u201d  Uh, no.  YOUR wedding (not that you wanted it to begin with) so you and Kate get the ultimate say.  People will get over it once you're married and if they don't, that's their issue, not yours.  Wishing you both many years of happiness, hopefully less drama laden than your engagement is turning out!", "NTA\n\nAt all. Your mother pushed the boundaries and now she can live with it.", "NTA..  I'm confused with the \"it's at her house so she get's to decide.\"  It's NOT her wedding so why does she get to pick out everything for YOUR wedding?\n\nCrap, I would have been flipping her the bird as I was telling her.. She sounds like a nightmare", "Your mother is insanely controlling. Not her marriage and not her decisions. NTA", "You are so NTA and you have demonstrated that you\u2019ll put your fianc\u00e9e first now and in the future, that message is priceless. Your Mum, respectfully, sounds pretty toxic and overbearing.", "My mum did this. And I went ahead with it and hated it. And what's worse, she was angry at me the day after the wedding about goodness knows what and said something nasty. And I said 'but I did all this to make you happy'. And she said 'well you shouldn't have'. \nAnd I never have again. You CANNOT make these people happy. But you can make yourselves happy so do that. NTA but by gosh these narcissistic mothers are.", "[removed]", "So he can have his mom run everything besides his wedding? Are you kidding me lol", "You hit the nail on the head more than you think. She is also insisting on fixing Kate\u2019s hair for the wedding (my mom is a hair dresser) and last week Kate went for a dry run of wedding hair. Kate showed her what she wanted and it was nothing like what was in the picture. I don\u2019t know all the technical terms but Kate ended up looking like Shirley Temple with big bangs. It was also really ratted in the back and by the time Kate got home she was in tears, it took her 2 hours to get all the tangles out and she lost a lot of hair because of it.\n\nThis sounds crazier and crazier the more I think about it.", " Even the extremely reasonable request to move the wedding to the deck to accommodate grandparents was overruled, which to me seems less about her wedding vision and more so about her needing to control everything.", "That\u2019s like saying wherever you have your wedding gets to design and feed you whatever they prefer and you don\u2019t get a say.", "The only thing she should get to decide are the permanent modifications OP would like to do to the place and the safety issues: as it is her place, she could be sued if someone is hurt. But even regarding this last point, she seems unreasonable. OP is absolutely NTA.", "They aren\u2019t even paying for anything. We have paid for everything. Anything she had bought for the wedding were things we didn\u2019t want. For example, she bought a bunch of table clothes that don\u2019t match or go with any of the colors Kate wanted.", "One thing that is complicating matters that I didn\u2019t have enough characters for is that I am living across the country from our home state getting our new home ready, and Kate has been back tying up loose ends and taking care of wedding prep. Our honeymoon is us moving all of her belongings to our new home.", "Yes, which is one reason our honeymoon is us moving across the country.", "Exactly, and Kate\u2019s grandma currently has a black eye from a bad fall, just from a liability stand point I don\u2019t think they should be walking down any stairs or into a muddy yard on someone else\u2019s property.", "What? My mom doesn\u2019t own my house. The wedding was supposed to be at my parents house. my fianc\u00e9 and I are moving to another state the day after we get married, we have paid for everything wedding wise and we pay all of our own bills. Maybe if you read through you would have picked up on that.", "What are you talking about she sounds more like Genghis Khan \u2620\ufe0f", "Even coming to the wedding is a lot for her Grandparents. We didn\u2019t expect them to come since their health sucks but since Kate won\u2019t have any parents there, they want to come. So, asking to have our wedding at their house is out.", "I actually really love this idea. And, we will be passing through Victoria BC on our honeymoon as we are moving from Ut to Ak.", "\"You CANNOT make these people happy. \nBut you can make yourselves happy so do that.\"\n\nAn important lesson to learn and repeat to yourself as needed.", "I wish I had an award for you. This is how it always plays out. Just get off the damn ride. Stick to your guns, OP.", "It's not HER EVENT. It's HER SON'S WEDDING. And the people who plan it are her son and his fianc\u00e9e.", "So by this logic venues should get the final say for what you\u2019re doing with their space?", "In the long run, it is the actual reason my baby daddy is sitting alone in a literal trash pile with moldy dishes, which is why I spotted it from your post. His mother did exactly the same sort of shit, planned an entire baby shower behind our backs and got mad we told her we were only going to the shower we planned. Make sure Kate knows you see it and will run interference when necessary. Hopefully this is just some sort of weird reaction on your mom's part to you getting married.", "Sometimes you need to write things out to see it clearly. Now you can. Put an end to the madness and live your lives.", "It also sounds like sabotage.  Your mom wants to ruin (or stop) the wedding. She does NOT have good intentions. Pull the plug on this shitshow.", "I hope you can get most of your money back for the catering etc", "No offense, OP, but your mom sounds kind of unhinged. Like, did she have a terrible MIL that dominated her wedding, and she thinks this is her chance at a do-over? Does she just hate Kate and her family and wants to sabotage everything? Nothing in what you're describing is kind, welcoming, or even logical. \n\nYou were kind enough to try to do a wedding solely for her feelings to start with. Then she went off the deep end. If her only justification is \"it's my house, I get final say\", then you are well within your rights to say \"screw it, then we're not having a wedding so it won't be at your house\" \n\nYou owe her no apology. She did this to herself.", "Oh so is your mother also unhappy and blaming Kate for you moving away from her?", "Like Carl and Ellie!", "I'm sorry she's like this. I hope you and your wife have an amazing life together :)", "Good on ya for watching out for them", "Let her plan and skip out at the last minute, just don't show up and leave mom standing alone in the mud.", "We won't have it at your house, so there is nothing to decide.\"\n\nNTA", "I am starting to think that the bottom line is she doesn\u2019t like Kate. Kate is divorced, older than me, and neither of us want kids. She has repeatedly made comments to Kate about having kids despite the fact that we have told her to stop. She straight up told Kate she thinks we need to have 2 kids and she already named them for us.", "She shouldn\u2019t blame Kate, since I was planning on moving long before Kate came into the picture and it was no secret.", "Please go low or no contact with your mom for Kate\u2019s sake. And congratulations on finding each other!", "Uh, tell her to have 2 more kids herself if she wants that much control.", "Oh, my MIL hated me. She hates me even more now.", "Everything you have said in this post is what JustNoMIL is made of.", "Omg \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. Poor Kate.  Poor you.", "Regardless of her feelings of Kate, right now she is disrespecting YOU and Kate. She is going behind your back, ignoring your wants and requests, overruling you, and doing whatever the hell she wants. \n\nI don't know if this is about not liking Kate, it seems more about control and her own vision of the day and frankly, not treating you like an adult, but like a child that she has final say over. Don't do yourself the disservice of trying to write it off as coming from not liking Kate. Her behavior is disrespecting you both and you need to be wounded just as much as Kate is.", "Your mother is unhinged.", "Yeah that's red flags as hell. Think of it if it were anyone unrelated to you or similar doing what she does/says. It'd be so out of line, so why is it okay for your mom to try to drive a wedge and force her opinions on the both of you?  \nYou are SO NTA and thank you for standing up for Kate.", "Your mom\u2019s a real peach huh", "Hooooooooooly smokes.\n\nI suggest writing that last sentence down all by itself and thinking about it for a while.  There is.  A lot.  To unpack there.", "We are moving across country (thank god.) I have no intention of letting anyone disrespect or mistreat Kate. She is an angel of a human and her last marriage neary killed her (literally) so I will do whatever I can to keep her happy and safe, even if it means sticking to some big boundaries. In fact, her mom isn\u2019t coming because she called Kate a \u201choe\u201d because we had sex before marriage.", "You sound like an awesome partner and I wish the two of you all the happiness in your future", "You are a shiny-spined FH. You and Kate are lucky to have each other!! For more crazy MIL stories check out r/JUSTNOMIL.\nWishing you the best!!"]}
