She left me with $200,000 in life insurance, and I used $20,000 of it to cover the funeral expenses.\n\nNow, my wife's family is demanding a large portion of the remaining life insurance money. Her parents want to use it to rebuild their home in Florida that was destroyed in a recent hurricane. The thing is, they didn't have insurance, and I don't think it's fair for me to cover their losses with the money that my wife left me.\n\nMy wife's brother also wants a portion of the money to pay for his college tuition. While I sympathize with his situation, I don't think it's my responsibility to fund his education. My wife left this money to me for a reason, and it's up to me to decide how to use it.\n\nWhen I told my wife's family that I couldn't give them the money they were asking for, they accused me of being selfish and not caring about their situation. They said that my wife would have wanted them to have the money and that I was going against her wishes.\n\nI feel terrible for my wife's family, but I also have my own financial responsibilities. I have bills to pay, and I want to make sure that I can take care of myself in the future. I don't want to put myself in a difficult financial situation by giving away a large portion of the life insurance money.\n\nThis is an opportunity for me to pay off my debts and buy the dream home me and my wife always wanted. Maybe I'm being selfish but I feel like I am not in the wrong. Me and my wife never really discussed what to do with life insurance money other than the occasional joke of buying the dream home we want or a starter one. I miss her so terribly.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to give my wife's family a large portion of her life insurance money?", "created_utc": 1681761822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pusgu/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_wifes_family_a_large/", "score": 2987, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She left me with $200,000 in life insurance, and I used $20,000 of it to cover the funeral expenses.\n\nNow, my wife's family is demanding a large portion of the remaining life insurance money. Her parents want to use it to rebuild their home in Florida that was destroyed in a recent hurricane. The thing is, they didn't have insurance, and I don't think it's fair for me to cover their losses with the money that my wife left me.\n\nMy wife's brother also wants a portion of the money to pay for his college tuition. While I sympathize with his situation, I don't think it's my responsibility to fund his education. My wife left this money to me for a reason, and it's up to me to decide how to use it.\n\nWhen I told my wife's family that I couldn't give them the money they were asking for, they accused me of being selfish and not caring about their situation. They said that my wife would have wanted them to have the money and that I was going against her wishes.\n\nI feel terrible for my wife's family, but I also have my own financial responsibilities. I have bills to pay, and I want to make sure that I can take care of myself in the future. I don't want to put myself in a difficult financial situation by giving away a large portion of the life insurance money.\n\nThis is an opportunity for me to pay off my debts and buy the dream home me and my wife always wanted. Maybe I'm being selfish but I feel like I am not in the wrong. Me and my wife never really discussed what to do with life insurance money other than the occasional joke of buying the dream home we want or a starter one. I miss her so terribly.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to give my wife's family a large portion of her life insurance money?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're likely going to need a good chunk of that money as you transition to single income.\n\nAnd even if you didn't need any of that money, 200k in a retirement account means you can retire 4-10 years earlier depending on your age.  Would your wife rather you have several extra years to enjoy life or to clean up your families self imposed messes?\n\nFlood insurance is one of the cheapest insurances you can but because it's heavily subsidized by the government. It's usually like 50$ a month. If you live in Florida, own a home, and don't have it, it's your own fault. Many mortgages even require it.", "So true. My mom was surviving on a pension check and living with me when she died. I paid all of the bills and she contributed a small amount to the rent. I found out after she died that she was paying my adult sister\u2019s cell bill. My mom had no life insurance so we didn\u2019t have anything coming to us, but my sister threw a fit because \u201cwho was going to pay her cell bill\u201d and then she cried because she felt like she should get my mom\u2019s phone, which I was going to give to my mom\u2019s niece who was also living with us and who was 14. \n\nShe made a big stink over material things when we didn\u2019t even have the money to pay for her funeral.

Nothing on paper just a \"trust me bro\" my dad had to hire an attorney to enforce the original will to divide their estate equally amo h the 4 children.

That'd be just a couple years' worth of the spouse's salary, so unless you're already 65, your spouse had a ton more lifetime earning potential that's now lost.", "Yes, this is what I came here to say as well. The purpose of life insurance is to give the surviving partner time to adjust to the new financial situation they are in after losing a partner. Life insurance is not the same as an inheritance or a lottery win or a prize in a contest. I am sorry that on top of coping with the loss of his wife, OP has to deal with his late wife's family being terrible and trying to capitalize on the loss of their sister/daughter to offset their previous bad financial decisions.

He made the conscious choice that if it got nailed in a hurricane, he'd take the loss and probably still come out ahead in the end.", "Adding on to this, I know that seems too soon, but bank that money securely.

If she HAD wanted her parents and/or brother to receive a payout from the insurance policy, they would have been on it as beneficiaries. How did they even know about this money?", "Same here -  we both have reasonably large policies but, in reality, it's enough to cover lost income and additional expenses should one of us pass.

Hurricane insurance, however, is an entirely different ball of was, and is incredibly expensive.  I know folks who did the math, and for them it was cheaper to roll the dice and maybe have to pay out of pocket to rebuild. They explained that if they paid for hurricane insurance for 10 years, they could have paid the same amount as they would to build a new house.\n\nAt any rate, OP's wife left him that money, and it is his to do with as he chooses.

For Example husband 50% then 20% to mom, 20% to dad and 10 to sibling. She did not", "This is what I came here to say.

End of story.", "You can also have multiple beneficiaries and determine what percentage they each get.

Flooding is what destroys most homes in a hurricane and people skip out of flood insurance. So while yes adding flood insurance to your policy is more expensive, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s this ridiculous price that\u2019s way more expensive then your normal homeowners policy.", "A mortgage company may require homeowners insurance, but I haven't heard of it being required if you own the home outright, at least where I live. I'm not familiar with hurricane coverage, but where I live flooding coverage is often an additional cost.", "It's a requirement of the mortgage company. If you own your home free and clear, you don't have to have it. You'd be stupid not to, but you could make that decision.", "It\u2019s not required if you own your home outright.

You are 10000% right...it is flooding that does people in. Flood insurance is not outrageous but too many floridians roll the dice", "Same thing with flood insurance. If you live in a flood zone, the bank and/or your insurer may require you to carry separate flood insurance. But otherwise, you can take your chances.

Assuming OP is a man I think they don't see him as much as a victim as they would with a widow whose husband died. With men it's just assumed they can care for themselves, so the family might not feel as bad as they would otherwise.", "A lot of cities in Florida have stopped even offering insurance to new builds because of the worsening environmental crisis. They see it as a losing investment since hurricane seasons are worsening and water levels are rising.

Why offer coverage to a house you know will suffer some sort of catastrophe at some point.", "No tax on life insurance. (US anyway)", "I think the question is if the wife was alive would she have given them money to rebuild their home. Just because she wasn\u2019t giving them a regular allowance doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t have given them money out of her own income to support them on this instance. Although her death was a huge loss to OP financially it is also possible that it negatively impacted others, as well. I think it\u2019s only for OP to determine whether she would have wanted some of the money to go to her family but I disagree with some of your assumptions.", "Really, to give the money to someone else instead of the intended person, that would almost disrespect the wife's wishes", "I call it \"vultures circling the rabbit\"", "She left YOU with the money, not them. If she wanted them to have some of it she should've put it in a will or agreement", "When my wife died, I waited until all the life insurance was settled up, took a screen shot of my bank balance, then wire transferred most of it to the mortgage company.  Family income was cut 65% and there was no way I could stay in my home.  While plenty of folks have offered opinions on what might have been smarter choices, I\u2019m fully vested and in a state pension, have other retirement funds and now own $700k or worth of properties free and clear.  I\u2019m debt free save for a piddly car payment, my kid or kids are going to college for free (.edu job) and I\u2019m retiring at 57 or 58.   I\u2019ll sell off my houses and buy a little place up in a holler somewhere and sit on my porch all day.  Her life insurance/401k totaled about $220k.

She did not, therefore they get nothing.", "Fourteen thousand dollars for insurance?! Sweet Jesus!", "Hahahahaha", "As an ex-Floridian (from Boca Raton) myself I call this a bad take.

I miss being able to run to the store past 8pm and have things actually be open. I miss people leaving me the fuck alone. I live currently in a more \"southern\" place and would take people not caring that i exist over \"southern hospitality\" any day since it's actually a twisted way of saying \"I'm going to be nosy as fuck and talk shit about you later.

I cannot fathom demanding cash from an relative after a loss. I would instead be asking if I can come over help clean the house, cook food, offer company, maybe even pitch in with funeral costs.

Also explains why she tried to make me feel guilty since she no longer had anyone to pay it for her. I wasn\u2019t swayed at all.", "Yeah, it was like a whole second level of grieving I had to go through. I was absolutely surrounded by support for the first month or so, but then I was mostly on my own except for the local ones who constantly checked up on me (and eventually had to force me to get help because I was... Not okay).    \n\nThe friends I lost were mostly friends we made together, so maybe they just didn't like me as a single person? Idk. Surprisingly, the vast majority of his old friends that I met *after* we started dating never went anywhere, even after I remarried.

Motion passed!", ">You can literally make anyone you want a beneficiary of your life insurance. \n\nGlad I saw your comment BEFORE I posted the exact same thing.  In fact, you can also put down the percentage that each beneficiary should get.", "> You literally pick who it goes to when you file for it.\n\nYou can also designate multiple beneficiaries and the percentages that they each get.  Your wife designated you as beneficiary at 100%.  That is a very strong statement of her wishes.  Them trying to say that she would have wanted them to have the money is pure greed on their part.  The way she structured the payout is the only thing you need to see to know that you are NTA.  Stand strong, and tell them, \"NO!\"  It is her legacy to you.

It's stupid not to have it, but it's not required to have it.", "If you have a mortgage, the lien holder requires insurance.

Once I was confident our kids were doing okay, I went back to school to update and further my degree as a nurse. But yeah, all that stuff is a lot of work to set up, and it doesn't last forever so finding another income stream is necessary. Especially if you are trying to make sure your kids have the ability to access education (trade school, college/university, masters/PhD programs).

Is it worth it?", "They probably are mourning/grieving, but they are also being money hungry. They don't deserve that money by way of their relation - the deceased left her policy and the money that is payed out from that to her spouse. The only way they'd have some claim -morallt- is if they paid for her funeral and not her spouse. Then they'd be entitled to a reimbursement for what they put out for the services.
