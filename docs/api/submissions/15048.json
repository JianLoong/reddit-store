She left me with $200,000 in life insurance, and I used $20,000 of it to cover the funeral expenses.\n\nNow, my wife's family is demanding a large portion of the remaining life insurance money. Her parents want to use it to rebuild their home in Florida that was destroyed in a recent hurricane. The thing is, they didn't have insurance, and I don't think it's fair for me to cover their losses with the money that my wife left me.\n\nMy wife's brother also wants a portion of the money to pay for his college tuition. While I sympathize with his situation, I don't think it's my responsibility to fund his education. My wife left this money to me for a reason, and it's up to me to decide how to use it.\n\nWhen I told my wife's family that I couldn't give them the money they were asking for, they accused me of being selfish and not caring about their situation. They said that my wife would have wanted them to have the money and that I was going against her wishes.\n\nI feel terrible for my wife's family, but I also have my own financial responsibilities. I have bills to pay, and I want to make sure that I can take care of myself in the future. I don't want to put myself in a difficult financial situation by giving away a large portion of the life insurance money.\n\nThis is an opportunity for me to pay off my debts and buy the dream home me and my wife always wanted. Maybe I'm being selfish but I feel like I am not in the wrong. Me and my wife never really discussed what to do with life insurance money other than the occasional joke of buying the dream home we want or a starter one. I miss her so terribly.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to give my wife's family a large portion of her life insurance money?", "created_utc": 1681761822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pusgu/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_wifes_family_a_large/", "score": 655, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She left me with $200,000 in life insurance, and I used $20,000 of it to cover the funeral expenses.\n\nNow, my wife's family is demanding a large portion of the remaining life insurance money. Her parents want to use it to rebuild their home in Florida that was destroyed in a recent hurricane. The thing is, they didn't have insurance, and I don't think it's fair for me to cover their losses with the money that my wife left me.\n\nMy wife's brother also wants a portion of the money to pay for his college tuition. While I sympathize with his situation, I don't think it's my responsibility to fund his education. My wife left this money to me for a reason, and it's up to me to decide how to use it.\n\nWhen I told my wife's family that I couldn't give them the money they were asking for, they accused me of being selfish and not caring about their situation. They said that my wife would have wanted them to have the money and that I was going against her wishes.\n\nI feel terrible for my wife's family, but I also have my own financial responsibilities. I have bills to pay, and I want to make sure that I can take care of myself in the future. I don't want to put myself in a difficult financial situation by giving away a large portion of the life insurance money.\n\nThis is an opportunity for me to pay off my debts and buy the dream home me and my wife always wanted. Maybe I'm being selfish but I feel like I am not in the wrong. Me and my wife never really discussed what to do with life insurance money other than the occasional joke of buying the dream home we want or a starter one. I miss her so terribly.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to give my wife's family a large portion of her life insurance money?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
