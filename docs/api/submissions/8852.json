If she weren't laying claims to his money and trying to dictate his profession, I might have felt differently as some things are better left unsaid. But in this case? She needs more than that as a reality check THAT'S for sure.

She sounds like she\u2019s in it for the wrong reasons", "lol NTA.\n\nThat being said, their relationship isn't yours to referee. Your issues with her may not be issues for him. Maybe he loves her and enjoys seeing her dream big. Maybe it's the wrong pairing and they'll split eventually. She's unlikeable, but she isn't your problem to deal with.", "ESH \n\nYou bursted her bubble. It sounds like she feels very serious about the relationship and was in a fantasy world of wedding planning and dreaming her future. Sometimes people just want to share their joy and I think you could\u2019ve done that here instead of cut her down at every point. I think her attitude was pissing you off and you subtly turned on her. Plus, you knew that this relationship was serious to her if she was already thinking of wedding venues, so implying her relationship wouldn\u2019t last is hurtful. You could\u2019ve just let her have her moment and let the relationship fall apart if it was going to.\n\nAll that being said she\u2019s a total AH for trying to look down on you for having less money - which she assumes will be the case! (may or may not end up that way!) And the comment \u201cthis decision affects both of us\u201d is so disrespectful to your BIL. She\u2019s acting like theyre already married. She\u2019s a gf and the brother is just starting to pursue a career he\u2019s passionate about. She\u2019s not entitled to pick his career. He picks his career. and I just can\u2019t believe she talks about being a surgeon vs pediatrician so casually. Being a surgeon is such a high stress job where other peoples life is literally in your hands and a twitch of your thumb could put someone\u2019s life in danger. \n\nBeing a pediatrician is so sweet and you get to be around kids all the time! Also calling you a jealous bitch was wayyyyyy out of line.\n\nSo idk I may not be able to control my temper being around someone like that either. I\u2019m struggling between ESH and NTA but either way she\u2019s the bigger AH", "YTA", "NTA for sharing truths. She sounds like she\u2019s in it for the wrong reasons", "That and his income", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s realized that yet if she\u2019s picking expensive wedding venues", "Are you the girlfriend?"]}
