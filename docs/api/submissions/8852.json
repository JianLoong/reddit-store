They likely won't make it through the first year with her attitude. They have no time. Its all studying til the one night after every quarter they go hard on a friday night before resuming the following monday. Their vacations aren't vacations. They're when you're supposed to do doctors without boarders, type things, and other internships. Then there's residency match at the end of it all, a whole new kind of hell, way more stressful than the medical school interviews.\n\nSee, residency spots are controlled by the government, and there are more graduating students than residency spots. If you dont get one of your match picks, you soap into a residency that has an empty spot, or you can choose to match again next cycle which can work but can also screw you, even if you just got unlucky with no soap or match, because youre competing against even more people. It's safer for your career to specialize in something you'd hate than to risk programs wondering why you didn't match or soap the first time. Pay is controlled by the program, and it varies by location and specialty. You are basically living paycheck to paycheck because of freaking loans. As an attending pay varies, it's based on locality. Even the lower end of peds attendings is 180k (you do not make anywhere near that in residency, it doesnt matter how good you are). He will be more than comfortable with a future partner who works or doesn't work. \n\nWe got court house married at the end of medschool. Still haven't had a wedding. The wedding we will have will be paid for and hosted by a well to do family member. Our plan before that was to invite close friends and do a beach bonfire. Maybe well after residency, we'd do a decently sized thing. It's only from outside help we get to do it sooner. Residency is less hard than medschool. Things are secure. You know where you're going to be in 4 years. But it's still incredibly difficult. You still hardly see your partner.\n\nYour brother needs to find someone who will be there through all the hard times. Who will be secure in spending a good amount of time alone, who's willing to take on the brunt of the chores, potential child rearing, planning of parties, and outings with friends. How she's acting should show him she will most likely only be there through the hard times because of the paycheck at the end. He needs to find someone who's not thinking about his future pay when he's 8 years away from it, barring any fellowships, whos aware of what doctors actually go through. \n\nBut giving her the benefit of the doubt and that shes just naive, young, and little dumb and he really wants to have her be that support person, he really needs to explain this all to her so she can make an informed decision about whether or not she wants that kind of future. Cause its easy to think itll be all fun and games, that it will be like it is how it is on TV, its easy to fall into this fantasy when you just dont know what the life actually entails.

It's been a long road: it took 1.5 year of a post-bacc, 4 years of med school, 5 years of residency, and a 1-year fellowship until she finally started making good money.

Men who have women spend a disproportionate amount of money compared to their single peers, this isn't just a 2x price hike, it's often a spending increase that would take care more than double the man's original spending habits.\n\nImagine as a single dude you pay for store brand cereal, but once you get a girlfriend, he's now paying for name brand and getting more than 1 box of cereal. That usual $2 box is now a $4 and x2 so he's spending $8.

That was not a nice thing to say (especially considering it was likely also hurtful to your brother), but she was being a brat. \n\nAlso I met my now husband during his first year of medical school. 12+ years later he JUST started his first attending job. So if she's only in it for the money, time will handle that because I don't know of anyone that patient \ud83d\ude02", "NTA I completely get your concern about this girlfriend. She is totally giving off gold digger vibes. Take my advice: DONT MAKE YOUR BROTHER DEFEND HER. Instead ask her how she feels about children in front of your brother. I bet she doesn\u2019t want children they would be digging Into her pocket book after all. Your brother sounds like the nurturing type while she seems like the practical type. If you start to criticize her in front of you brother he will defend her and it will push them closer. Instead start asking how she feels about things that are important to your brother. Things you know they would disagree on. Make sure your brother feels supported regardless of his decision. Also next time she ask your brother why he doesn\u2019t choice a better career ask her why she doesn\u2019t choice to be a surgeon.", "NTA\n\nI hope he sees her for what she is, a gold digger.", "ESH. While the girlfriend does sound like a gold digger, it's also shitty to predict a couple is going to break up.", "I went to law school and it's very similar, most relationships that people had before starting school crumbed by the end. I know a small, small handful that didn't, in one case the couple already had multiple children and to be hugely honest I think they would have been divorced if not for that. In the only other cases I know people skipped out on a lot of supplemental activities\u2014 networking events, extracurriculars like journals and moot court, clubs for specialized practice areas, etc. Pretty much everyone I've talked to that's been in any sort of really time intensive graduate program has said the same.", "Now I ain't she's a gold digger, but she ain't messin' with no broke broke...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY", "My daughter was dating a guy and things seemed to being going really well. He made one mildly racist remark to someone and she dumped him. I always taught my kids to pay close attention to how their friends and dates treat others, as well as them. Daughter wasn\u2019t going to deal with a racist.", "Holy record Scratch Batman!", "Her thought process: \n\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026ALL doctors are rich! Aren\u2019t they? Whaddya mean they\u2019re not?\u201d", "I think its in everyone's best interest that this woman doesnt become a surgeon.", "Depends on your country. Mid level is 100k - 130k/year aud in Australia, and employers are desperate. Fancy moving? You can get sponsored!", "But you can't expect a woman to be honest.", "She\u2019d probably think Tractor Supply is too low class for a (future) doctor\u2019s wife & would rather order expensive designer chicken feed & aged artisan chicken coop wood off the internet.", "NTA, he needs to RUN from her!", "NTA- you\u2019re 100% correct and that surgeon comment was gold \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\"But babe, why would you want to help sick kids when you can have all this MONEY?\"\n\nYou kinda did imply that their relationship might not survive... but it was warranted. So I vote NTA. She was being gross. Why is he with her? I feel like their views are completely opposed.\n\nWasn't there a guy the other day who missed some restaurant dinner with his wife because one of his child patients died and she lost her shit at him? \n\nMaybe his wife and this girl can get together and  your BIL and the other guy can hook up!", "NTA. \u201cShe said this is a big decision that impacts both of us\u201d - no, this is a human deciding what he wants to do with HIS life. If he has half a clue he will ditch her ASAP", "Marrying a future doctor is one of the worst ways to gold dig. Enjoy the 200k+ student loan debt and 3-4 years of working long hours for minimal pay (as a peds resident). NTA. I\u2019ve been with my wife (a doctor) since undergrad. It\u2019s been 11 years together and I\u2019m still waiting on her to make more money than me (joking or course, but serious in that she still hasn\u2019t made the big bucks yet).", "NTA, your comment didn't even touch on the myriad of ways that she was going to destroy the relationship, you made it sound like it was med school that was going to ruin it, not her spendtrift, gold digging ways.", "NTA. Why wait? He should dump her now. She sounds ridiculous.", "NTA", "Who cares", "OP NTA unless you deliberately said it to stick a knife in it", "NTA.\n\nWow, and she said this in front of your brother?? If he doesn\u2019t dump her he loses the right to complain.", "DGGD\n\nDelayed gratification gold digger", "Hopefully, he meets a nice paediatric nurse to help him out. At least she would understand the passion it would take to cope with the demands of the job. \n\nNTA and I hope you BIL dumps the gold digger cause he cam do soooo much better.", "You thought you dodged one bullet, turns out it was multiple bullets like Neo in the Matrix!", "It sounds like the younger brother is still down so you're probably right about the relationship.", "Pahaha, based on how she couldn't even get through dinner without calling her potential sister in law a \"jealous bitch\", I don't think we have to worry."]}
