Girlfriend was acting super entitled and needed to be taken down a few notches.", "Lol you\u2019re not wrong. NTA for sharing truths. She sounds like she\u2019s in it for the wrong reasons", "lol NTA.\n\nThat being said, their relationship isn't yours to referee. Your issues with her may not be issues for him. Maybe he loves her and enjoys seeing her dream big. Maybe it's the wrong pairing and they'll split eventually. She's unlikeable, but she isn't your problem to deal with.", "ESH \n\nYou bursted her bubble. It sounds like she feels very serious about the relationship and was in a fantasy world of wedding planning and dreaming her future. Sometimes people just want to share their joy and I think you could\u2019ve done that here instead of cut her down at every point. I think her attitude was pissing you off and you subtly turned on her. Plus, you knew that this relationship was serious to her if she was already thinking of wedding venues, so implying her relationship wouldn\u2019t last is hurtful. You could\u2019ve just let her have her moment and let the relationship fall apart if it was going to.\n\nAll that being said she\u2019s a total AH for trying to look down on you for having less money - which she assumes will be the case! (may or may not end up that way!) And the comment \u201cthis decision affects both of us\u201d is so disrespectful to your BIL. She\u2019s acting like theyre already married. She\u2019s a gf and the brother is just starting to pursue a career he\u2019s passionate about. She\u2019s not entitled to pick his career. He picks his career. and I just can\u2019t believe she talks about being a surgeon vs pediatrician so casually. Being a surgeon is such a high stress job where other peoples life is literally in your hands and a twitch of your thumb could put someone\u2019s life in danger. \n\nBeing a pediatrician is so sweet and you get to be around kids all the time! Also calling you a jealous bitch was wayyyyyy out of line.\n\nSo idk I may not be able to control my temper being around someone like that either. I\u2019m struggling between ESH and NTA but either way she\u2019s the bigger AH", "YTA", "NTA for sharing truths.

He\u2019ll get a small salary during his residencies but that\u2019s it.  I hope he\u2019s smart enough to see that she wants him for his money", "NTA.\n\nShe needs a reality check. She seems to care more about the money her boyfriend might be making instead of the fact he still needs to go through medical school and actually become a doctor.", "NTA. I ain't saying she's a gold digger but... You really shouldn't comment on their relationship but she was asking for it.", "IMO she deserved it with her ridiculous comments.

That\u2019s the way it is for most doctors in the U.S., which is fine. Honestly, I think they should pay us less but make our education free. \n\nAlso, everyone I know who went into a high-paid specialty did it because they LIKED that field, and the money was just a bonus. Yeah, orthopedic surgeons (usually) make a lot of money. They also have a terrible work-life balance. That\u2019s a hard way to live if you don\u2019t enjoy your job.", "NTA.  Hopefully you did your BIL a massive favor and shined a light on all the massive red flags this girl is holding.", "NTA, they won't last past his first exam.", "NTA, maybe even a hero. \n\nIn college, I got a job that required me to move halfway across the country after graduating. My GF at the time still has another year of school left but told me how I was going to be living my life there, how my apartment should look, and that she wouldn't even visit me there unless I proposed. \n\nHopefully the doctor can see this on his own too, does what I did and move on and moves forward. \n\nAnd oddly enough, as much as she begged me not to break up and told me how much she loved me, she still wound up married to someone else less than 6 months later.", "NTA. She\u2019s waving more red flags than a Soviet color guard. I hope your brother dumps the gold digger, these types rarely change.", "YTA.  Some things just don't need to be said.

Add in four years of those, usually paid for via loans, and most graduate with about $300k in debt.  That grows during residency and most doctors spend 15 years paying it off.", "IMO she deserved it with her ridiculous comments.", "Gold Digger\u201d can be tattooed", "Which is hilarious because he probably has so much in student loans that she\u2019s not going to see any significant money for a good decade or so. \n\nMy SIL\u2019s a psychiatrist.
