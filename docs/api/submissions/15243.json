They refused to quote without my wife there. It\u2019s because they have high pressure sales tactics and will want you to sign up on the day and not have the excuse that you want to think about it and talk it through with the other half. Any company that tries to pull this crap with me is told I\u2019m not interested. Any reputable company will happily quote and give you time to get other quotes and think before making your decision.", "Tell him to show his sexist ass out the door.\n\nYou are an adult and presumably the (co)owner of the house.\n\nAs an adult, you can buy your own groceries, clothes and doors. No need to get somebody else's permission.\n\nAs the owner of the house, you can have the door you bought installed into your doorframe too.\n\nYWNBTA", "Around here, if the salesman seeks you out rather than the other way around, they\u2019re probably a scammer.", "NTA...he's lost a sale. Let him know and move on.", "There\u2019s a window company here in the US who wouldn\u2019t meet with me without my husband. And I don\u2019t have one so that made it especially difficult.", "Actually while it seems sexist (and could be), a lot of door-to-door and places like dealerships are instructed to have anyone who is part of decisions there for the pitch. Simply for the reason that you can not use the excuse \"I need to talk to my husband. I need to talk to my wife. I need to talk to my partner.\" It is an objection that gets in the way of their \"closing\" you and is considered a waste of time in their world. I would imagine that his/her boss instructed them to not set up an appointment unless both husband and wife are present and they are stupidly following that instead of really assessing the situation. However, you are NTA. They have been given enough heads up that you are the decision maker. Tell them to take their pitch elsewhere.", "Tell them not to bother then, find a local company. What is happening here, and I'm guessing the company is Coral Windows and Doors, is they want you both there so they can do a pressure sale. They price it up, tell you they will give you a massive discount but it's only for now, once they leave the house that's it, no discount.\n\nWhat you don't realise is the price they will offer is on the range of 2-3x what a local business owner will charge you. Composite door costs 700-1200 depending on config and if there are windows either side. They will quote 2k+ as a minimum.", "Thanks all! I called the company and was told it\u2019s policy post covid so they don\u2019t have to come back again  to explain to someone else - I again informed them of the above and they still stuck to it. Weirdos haha, gave them a bad review and good luck if they ever knock on the door again!", "NTA. Call his company and ask it to have a different salesperson contact you, that you are still interested in considering a purchase - but not with him and not under his sexist conditions. If the company won't meet your conditions, make it clear that you are no longer interested in doing business and find another company.", "It's either about having the perceived decision maker there, or the salesman doesn't want to risk any sort of allegations that may be brought about by the 2 of you being alone. Context is everything and only you can really judge where they are likely to fall on that. Definitely NTA though, go somewhere else and enjoy your new front door when you get it!", "YWNBTA\n\nTell him to kick rocks.  Sounds sexist to me. Sounds like the old, outdated view that the man of the house makes all the decisions, and so he feels that not meeting with the husband is wasting his time because he's not talking to the person who gets final say. If you really want to stick it to him, you should contact the company and schedule with a different salesperson. That way, if you do end up liking the offerings and go with them, you'll be giving what could've been his commission to another person in the office to make sure he knows what he missed out on for being a sexist tool.", "I have had people talk over me when buying a car. My dad was with me because he drove me there, obviously the car is for me, I will use the car, I will buy the car, not my dad.\n\nNeedless to say the next shop I went to didnj't pull that crap and I actually bothered looking at their cars there. I hate it when people assume I don't know anything or even refuse to talk to me and help out just because I'm not a guy.\n\nThis person either doesn't expect you to be able to make the decisions at home and refuses to listen, or he wants to talk to both of you at the same time so you can't discuss privately and am more pressured into a sale.", "NTA, tell him to go kick rocks with his misogynistic ass.", "I wonder if its a security thing, having both adults together. Safer for you and salesperson to come to your home, a stranger adult male \ud83e\udd14  but could also be sexism.   \n\nNTA for refusing his  services if he refuses to talk business", "NTA guy sounds sexist, there is no reason that your husband has to be there too.", "NTA\n\nTell him to take a walk!\n\nBut I will add that it's probably not the sales person being sexist or wanting a more secure station. When I was younger, I answered a job ad for a door-to-door sales position (not realizing that's what it was) and the company's policy was that you had to pitch to couples and they had to both be there for the pitch because it was an expensive item you were selling.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't *that* expensive (mostly overpriced) in the grand scheme of things, but the actual ploy was hoping that the person that initiated the pitch would want the item so badly that they would manipulate the other partner into saying yes so that \"they both agreed it was a good purchase\" and they could more easily deny returns.", "I only read the title. \n\nAnd are absolutely serious. You came to reddit and ask strange if you would a bad person if you told a salesman to leave you alone? Honestly be for real.", "Pushy tactics. Not sexist per se. I am a woman who works in kitchen sales, ideally for such a large project I want both of the home owners there, as \"ah well I need to consult my partner\" is a get out of jail card after I've put in hours of work.

They either want to sell to you or they don\u2019t.  As the customer it\u2019s your choice who they talk to and if they don\u2019t like it they can move on.", "I can guess the name of the company. Tell them to get lost & get quotes from reputable local companies who send an actual fitter to quote rather than a salesman.", "NTA timeshares are like this and want you to sign immediately.", "This is common and they would have done this if your husband was booking alone.  They want you to sign that very day of the presentation and are trying to take away the \u201clet me talk to my spouse\u201d part.  They will say stuff like if you sign today there is a 40% discount but if you think about it and sign tomorrow the discount goes away.  \n\nJust tell the guy that your hubby cannot make it work so you guess you need to give up trying to meet and hear his pitch.  Go someplace like Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s and they even have people that can install it.", "NTA. I\u2019m in sales/home repair and would never give a shit who is home. I\u2019ll talk to any of my homeowners that wants to listen and be educated about garage doors.", "NTA back in the 80's my husband worked for months abroad and we had a fixer upper, so I had to organise a lot of the work to be done. I ran into this problem continuously. Over the years it has gotten better in most of these house renovation industries, apart from double glazing. I booked an appointment just recently and they refused to come out because my husband was away in London. We refused to book any appointment with that company after that because they guy on the phone was incredibly misogynistic and spoke to me like I was the 'little woman' who couldn't understand how the world worked. I told hubby I was going to tell them he was dead, if I made any more appointments with another company. How female project managers get anything booked I've no idea. They are very high pressure sales and keep you hostage for hours.", "NTA.  It\u2019s a sexiest old school practice.  This was back in the 90\u2019s but when I tried my hand at sales calls my company wouldn\u2019t pay me for the visit if the man of the house wasn\u2019t present.  I moped out of that shit job quickly.  They had some stupid belief that a woman couldn\u2019t make financial decisions for a house.   It\u2019s hard to believe that the practice is still going on.", "NTA but the reason that they do this is not sexiest at all. It\u2019s because they are much more likely to get a sale if all homeowners are present. Generally, a lot of door-to-door sales company, have this rule, because when one spouse make the purchase decision and the other one\u2019s not there the likelihood of it getting backed out as much, much higher. \n\nI know this because my partner works for one of these companies. \n\nThey would have said the exact same thing if your husband was the stay at home partner and you were working wife.", "NTA. Companies do this so you can't say \"I have to ask my husband\". It's totally sexist. Anyone who says it to me gets an automatic no.", "NTA If a company is unwilling to work with the person who makes decisions, they don't get the work.\n\nHonestly, you will be dodging a bullet. There's nothing worse than dealing with sexist tradies. Like you, I'm the one who usually books, meets with, arranges and coordinates with people working on our house, and ISTG, the number of times my husband has to scrape me off the ceiling after I've spent a day being patronised, talked over, ignored and belittled.\n\nNow, we just do not hire anyone who gives me the vibe.\n\nThe only way to make sexist tradies change is by making their sexism costly. Don't hire them, and tell them why you're not hiring them.", "NTA. I wouldn't do business with these misogynist.  I know how you feel. A couple years ago I (single female home owner needed a new roof. 9ne of the f9mpany\nIt's I called for an estimate showed up at barely daylight, never went up on the roof, never talked to me and left an estimate tucked in my door addressed to Mr. (my last name). I never used to word we when I called or mentioned a husband. I did use that company.", "This is the correct answer. Fuck those people.", "That\u2019s not why these policies exist. My husband works for one of these companies. Regardless of gender, or homeowners must be present because otherwise sales time to get canceled. It\u2019s to help them avoid wasting time on sales that aren\u2019t going to work out.", "Haha yes I am always careful but this is a legit company I\u2019ve checked", "As well in my country (nearby UK). It is legit to do but also frowned upon\u2026", "Lots of pushy sales people around still. Even then, those typical pushy sales people would prefer to talk to the female partner if they could, because the stereotype is that women don't know hardware/cars/ect.", "Oh my lol\n\nThe stupidity!", "Yes this seems totally likely! Thanks", "They are lying to you. It\u2019s really just increased their sales rate. But it\u2019s based on real behavior and it works.

One afternoon when I happened to be off work I took my 8 year old son with me to a dealership.  During the test drive my son mentioned that his Dad would like the car.  Salesman said wasn\u2019t it nice my husband would \u201clet\u201d me look at cars without him.  I immediately drove back and in the middle of the showroom loudly told him he would NEVER get a sale from me because of his sexist remarks.  Probably didn\u2019t change him, but did make me feel good.", "No, it\u2019s about wanting the \u201cdecision maker\u201d there.", "Nope it\u2019s joint ownership - I did wonder if this May be the reason but he hasn\u2019t even asked about this ..?", "The company may be legit, but this person may not work for the company \ud83d\udc40 I would verify they are real.

It Hass to do with the likelihood of a sale getting reversed if all home owners are not present. Basically, they don\u2019t want the representatives wasting their time on a situation that\u2019s not likely to lead to a permanent sale.", "Yes, exactly. It\u2019s literally a rule for these companies.", "That was so uncalled for yeah, to think he'd thought it was appropriate to say?\n\ngood riddance", "Ah well then.

It\u2019s about making sure that everybody who hast to make a decision about the sale. Is there an present during the sale so they can close the sale real time?"]}
