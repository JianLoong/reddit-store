The rep didn't make a big deal about. We half expected them to pack up and leave indignantly. I did video call my husband during the meeting, but it was mostly symbolic.", "NTA. But tell this salesman to not let the door hit you where the dog shoulda bit you. Then contact the company to let them know he wouldn't set an appt with you because you are a woman. Then find a contractor to do the work.", "I had something similar happen recently.  Called a place to get quotes about windows, dude asked if I was married, hubby would be there, etc.... Freaked me out a little cause I watch waaaaaay too many true crime shows  But then when we met with the sales guy he explained that he wanted to show both of us the options so we could discuss it, etc, etc he could answer questions and it saved everyone some time.  No playing phone tag - what about this?  My husband wanted to know about that?  Wife was curious about yadda yadda...back and forth.  All that to say - the sales guy's attitude was he wanted us to both have the options, etc to make our decision.  At one point my husband said - whatever she wants ...and the guy was cool with it.  From there on out it was just me and sales dude figuring out what I wanted, ordering, etc, etc.  \n\nBasically, you were the one talking to him, what did his tone of voice lean toward?  Trust your gut.  And I would totally call the company directly and confirm he works for them, etc.... again, true crime shows.  ;)", "It is a high-pressure sales tactic. They don't want you to be able to say after you meet that you want to discuss it with your husband.", "A few homeowners in my neighbourhood have recently been scammed by \"legit\" contractors who first destroy what they were supposed to be fixing (roof, driveway, gutters) and then demand a higher payment to finish the work.", "What some of the others have said.  Find yourself a contractor/tradesman and have your door fixed.", "As someone who used to work for a exteriors company with the exact same policy, yeah its just \"experience based\" sexism, some of the older salesmen got annoyed after closing deals only to have the husbands see the offer later and say no, losing their commission and making up this \"rule\" to prevent wasting time on \"less influential opinions\" ( yeah thats litteraly what my old manager called women homeowners opinions)", "Many years ago I had recently had a baby and needed to change from my sports car to a family type car. I researched a lot of cars and settled on the exact car make and model that I wanted (a Volvo). My DH and I went to a dealer that he had bought cars from before ( he was a huge Volvo fan) and we tried to negotiate a good price. It was a new, popular model and they weren\u2019t negotiating too much. \n\nSo I went through a car purchase program where you give them the exact car features that you want and they send you to an associated dealer where you make an appointment and they give you a price for that exact car. It might be a fleet price. Usually there is no negotiation - but it\u2019s a good price. So I did this and got a better price. I made an appointment and took the baby with me. An important point for me was how easily the infant seat could clip in and out of the car. My DH was watching a game and happy for me to go take care of it. We were paying cash so no loan papers needed to be signed. I met with their finance guy, he gave me the price, I told him I wanted it, but needed to drive it first. I had driven in the car ( my cousin had one) but not driven it myself. He told me the demo was just outside and referred me to the sales guy. \n\nWhile I was outside clipping my baby & seat into the back (very easy!). The sales guy asked what I was doing. I showed him my paperwork from the appointment and told him I wanted to drive the car. He told me to come back with my husband! I was a little stunned. I\u2019d purchased new cars when I was single and thought that was really odd. I replied that it will be my car, my husband knows all about it and I brought my checkbook. He reluctantly goes off to get the keys. Fifteen minutes later he comes back to tell me that he can\u2019t find the keys and another sales guy must have taken them home. Really?! No 2nd set of keys?! Says that if I come back tomorrow I can bring my husband too. \n\nI was pissed! I went to the 1st dealer and told them my story with their competitor. I showed them the written offer. They were shocked that I had a written offer and they loved my story. They offered to sell me the car for $200 less than that offer if they can tell everyone my story about their competitor. I told them \u2018please do!\u2019 and bought the car. They even delivered it to me at work 2 weeks later when the car arrived. 30 years later and I\u2019m still pissed off about this!", "This sounds like a scammer.", "I've been to sales seminars which teach this tactic. The purpose is multifaceted but mostly enables them to avoid a buyer's delaying technique of, \"I'll need to talk with my spouse.\" If their product and pricing are competitive then they wouldn't need to do this."]}
