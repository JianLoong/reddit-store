YTA for that alone- you seem to actually understand very little about tweenagers. No Dad, YOUR son is of an age where finding his independence is important. Growing up is important. And impressing his peers is important. He wasn\u2019t mad because his friends were jealous he\u2019s mad because he does t want to be seen as a little kid. Kudos on raising a great kid who wants to share his accomplishments with you- don\u2019t blow it by being too hard headed to respect his boundaries. Enjoy the kisses and hugs AT HOME while you still can and treat him in a way that\u2019s more respectful of his growing independence at school.", "You're not an asshole for kissing him at school one time before you knew he didn't like it. You *were* wrong to kiss him at school, he didn't want you to, and the teacher clearly saw the whole interaction. Parent volunteers shouldn't be all kissing and hugging their child during volunteer hours. Keep it the same level of professional with all the children - high fives and waves. But being wrong by accident doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nWhere you might be an asshole is dismissing his request as \"but I always kiss you\" or \"but you like it\", refusing to entertain the notion that kissing at home is fine but kissing at school is not fine, and arguing in the comments about it. If you continued to kiss him at school then you would also definitely be an asshole.", "Your kid is 11 and doesn\u2019t want to be kissed in front of other people. That\u2019s normal.

And no, his peers aren\u2019t \u201cjust jealous\u201d.\n\n\nThe whole dynamic of you being in his class is a bit weird. And I say this as a teachers kid. Generally teachers try to avoid teaching their own kids or even kids they are tutoring on the side. Volunteering in field trips is more common for parents (not always something the kids like though).", "When you are in the classroom as a volunteer, you are *not* supposed to act in the capacity of \"parent\".

He is 11 not 5.  You need to understand that he is growing up and for the next decade most PDAs between you and him are going to be cringeworthy.  It is perfectly fine and emotionally healthy to be affectionately and physically demonstrative with a preteen and teen-aged child - in private.  But in public unless it is for some big milestone or is instigated by the child, they are going to become increasingly embarrassed and put off by it.  It is part of growing up and creating their own identity.\n\nThe next potential phase - when they decide you are the most clueless person ever born - is even worse.  Fortunately, it too passes for most kids, usually around the age of 20.", "YTA based on the comments..accept that your child is growing as he should and adapt your behavior.\n\nHe did nothing wrong.

I don't envy you.  I hated that stage in my kids life.  They grow out of it eventually.  NTA.", "NAH. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't know about the boundary your son established. It happens. What matters is you respected it and you learn from it. If you're uncertain on how to proceed, just communicate with your son. Ask him what he wants and how you can respect his boundaries.", "NAH. There's nothing to analyze here, just a kid being a kid. I remember not wanting my mom or grandpa to pick me up from school or reacting badly.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like it is time to talk with him about it. Seems like he didn't inform you about his new rules, so how could you follow them. But he got upset, so there definitely is some new rule. Your boy is growing up and with him becoming a teenager these simple things will become more complicated. Good luck, haha!", "NTA! No worries man! Your son is just growing up, time to keep the cuddling and hugs with your little man at home. He'll probably still be more comfortable sharing affection in the privacy of the home instead of out in public where kids like to pick and tease each other!", "NTA, just be conscious of your surroundings in case he gets picked on. We all love to hug and kiss our kids but as they get older, you got think from their perspective as well. They got a social status to maintain. Cherish the hugs and kisses as long as you can.", "NTA, just a minor error.\n\nAs a father myself, i know that urge to hug and kiss my son and i consider myself lucky that my son (16) still likes to hug and get hugged by me.\n\nTalk with your son, tell him that you understand his situation and you will respect his boundaries. Then talk about where these boundaries exactly are and do your best to respect those boundaries.\n\nAlso know, this has nothing to do with your son loving you any less. If you do it right, this situation can even strengthen your bond and raise his respect for you. Like, what goes around, comes around. This goes also for positive things.", "NAH\n\nYour son is just growing up. Maybe just don't show him as much affection in public though.", "NTA, but mom, he ain't your baby no more. He's at that age where those kinds of public displays become embarrassing. Don't push the issue, get your hugs and kisses at home.", "Info - until you explain what these kids are \u201cjealous\u201d of, the vibes are off. \n\nEdit - Removing judgment.", "NAH\n\nyour kid is being a normal 11 year old. too much affection in front of his peers will embarrass him. Respect this and move on. keep communication open so he feels he can tell you when he is uncomfortable and things will be fine.", "NAH Most kids grow out of wanting their parents to kiss and hug them in public, this is normal. Be prepared for him to not even want you to get out of the car when you drop him off or pick him up.", "NAH\n\nPart of growing up. Apparently he's in the phase where PDA with your dad is cringe. He'll get over it. As long as he doesn't withdraw in public, you're fine.", "Think back to when you were that age.  Would you want the cringe of an overly affectionate parent slobbering over you in front of your teacher, friends etc?\n\nIt might be normal now but the sooner he approaches his teens, that's likely what he will think of it.\n\nNAH but let him decide.", "NAH but pay attention now that you know. Mine is 10, and I always ask before hugging or kissing him. Even at home and even though he\u2019s always loved snuggling. But he\u2019s at the age where that could change any minute, and I don\u2019t want him to resent me or feel like I\u2019m treating him like a little kid or be embarrassed/uncomfortable.

I was under strict instructions NEVER to kiss my kids goodbye when dropping them off at school once they got to about age 7 or 8. That didn't mean they didn't want affection at other times, but they are figuring out how to deal with embarrassment, and what other kids tease them about.\n\nJust take your cue from your child , if he doesn't want public displays in school, save it for home. It's not a reflection of your relationship to allow him to lead on this - in fact doing so shows you respect his autonomy.  You would very much be TA if you forced it on him in situations where he is uncomfortable with it -  even if you don't think he has a valid concern. Just show him that you will respect his decisions about how he is treated.", "NTA Welcome to puberty", "NTA, and you should laugh along with the teacher. Pre-teens are almost uniformly assholes.\n\nYour son is a 6th grader, which means he's far too cool to have parents at all, let alone one that would be proud of him or show him affection.

Just talk it out with him!", "NAH (except the teacher, but only slightly)\n\nYour son is at an age where parents are awful and embarrassing but he still loves you.

What that means in a social construct and if that\u2019s the kind of person he wants to be (or what kind of person does he want to be in general and if that flies in the face of social constructs how will he respond) talk to him about how you exist with your dad and your friends etc. \n\nAt his age everything is changing and it\u2019s better if we don\u2019t just leave them to it but guide them as much as we can, as much as will allow. \n\nI had great convos with my son while listening to Justin Baldonis Man Enough and Boys will be Human", "Nah my son is 11 and one day he\u2019s clinging to me like a baby and other days he\u2019s too cool to speak. It\u2019s okay just roll with the punches hah", "NTA my kids kiss me even infront of the school friends and thier class mates wants hugs from me. They allways say aww when my kids kiss me. That beeing said at the age from 14 kids develop a strong self-concious and will have easier to self-doubt, shame and such. Some children may be younger and affected by a social regulation from peers that it's not cool - this is why we parents need to learn to show that showing affection is ok. Age 14, 12, 10. Just shower with affection at home and be friendly towards others so your kid will be proud and assert thier ownership on you. lol \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude09", "NAH, and he\u2019s probably gonna want to cut down on signs of affection, god knows I did, but now I\u2019m 19 in my first year of college, and I really wish I could hug my mom right now. You seem like a great mom \u2764\ufe0f", "NAH\n\nMy friend, your kid is growing up! He\u2019s going to keep growing. 11 is a weird age, and what he likes in public he may not enjoy in front of his classmates. I see no harm, no foul here. Now you know. He\u2019s going to throw up all kinds of boundaries as he eventually dives into the puberty deep-end. \n\nSounds like you have a great relationship. Remember he loves you just the same, even through the distancing! Signed, sincerely, a 36 year old who still sometimes wants to cuddle her mom (just a little).", "Not an asshole, but yeah don't kiss him in front of friends. It's bad enough for us boys to have mum kiss us in front of friends let alone the dad\n\nHug is fine, just keep it to that unless he also rejects that in front of friends at some point and if he does then just keep the affection at home\n\nIts nothing against you, it's purely peer status when his friends can see", "Ah smell of new teenage... Good luck with teen life drama.   Hang on there for a bit longer. LOL NTA", "NAH, but children will tend to fluctuate in their acceptance of physical affection, especially in front of peers. The best thing you can do is respect his boundaries, as that will reinforce that you are a safe person.", "I never had physical affection from my parents. I'm still angry about it. \n\nI can't imagine getting embarrassed or telling them to stop. I know that's apparently normal, but maybe people should try to be grateful that they have parents who want to show them love.", "NTA. I remembered when someone would call a parent on the school phone in class and everyone would wait at the end as they reluctantly said \u201clove you too\u201d to their parents. To which the class would make fun of them. I never understood that. Shouldn\u2019t you want your parents love and the expression of it? I guess know they are growing up and for some reason that means they don\u2019t want to express love as much, but trust me as long as you have a good relationship they\u2019ll wish they took that hug later when you\u2019re gone", "NTA, your just an awesome dad!!\n\nIt's sad to see so many people call a parent an AH for showing affection to their child. It's not like the kid had ever told his dad not to hug him, this was the first time. You show your kids affection unless the kid asks for it to stop. Then you have a long conversation about WHY they want it to stop. If it's from peer pressure, you encourage them to not let peers define how they express themselves with their family. It it's from bullying, you stand up for your kid. Too many people judging others in the one area they should stay out of (another parents healthy relationship with a child).\n\nI'm guessing the teacher was kidding but if not their comment is very wrong too.", "YTA He is 11. his classmates could really bully him over that. Don\u2019t do that in school.", "YTA for kissing a middle schooler in front of other middle schoolers. Did you not attend public school?", "Ooh, welcome to growing tweens and teens.\n\nYou are no ahole, but you just missed the memo.\n\nYour kid loves you, but please don't embarrass him in public with expressions of... luv (ugh). It's all OK though. You asked if he was OK. He is, and he still loves you. Just don't give him a hug or kiss again in public for his teen years (unless he is the one giving you the hug.\n\nIn the meantime, cherish those at home hugs and kisses. There may be a few years ahead, where those are a little rare too.", "Hugs are apparently okay in public, but kisses are too babyish. Be prepared for this to change every few months. \n\nNTA.", "NAH\n\nRespect his boundaries now and one day you'll be sharing hugs again!", "NAH\n\nThe teenager software has started loading up, I wish you the best of luck.", "In my best Hank Hill voice, *\"Bobby, if you weren't my son, I'd hug you.\"*", "A side hug likely would have been OK! It was the kiss that embarrassed him.\n\nHe will be pulling away until he\u2019s older now. When he\u2019s in his 20\u2019s, he\u2019ll be proud to show you affection in public.\n\nAll four of my kids broke my heart in Middle School. But now, they freely give hugs.", "NAH, he still loves you, but when kids get older they\u2019ll want to display their affection in different ways.", "Kids that age can get funny about public affection because they get teased to heck. They still adore you but want to look all manly and tough in front of their mates.\n\nMy 12yo is neurodivergent and joyously gives zero shits what anyone thinks. I attended a school fair last autumn and he literally galloped across the entire hall and flung himself into my arms and I won't lie, it made my heart burst. But I know at some point I'll become the most embarrassing thing on earth and that's cool too because it shows he's growing up. If I still get the hugs in private, I'm thrilled. If I get no hugs but know he loves me, I can live with that.\n\nDon't sweat it...but let him show the way he wants to play it. Teenagerdom is hard enough without this stuff, so if he needs to do a little public image bullshit, give him the space.", "YTA \"he said not to kiss him. I always kiss him. He likes me to kiss him\"\n\n You heard him say don't do it, if you needed clarification on the fact that he doesn't want you to do it IN CLASS then just ask for the clarification, don't pretend to be stupid and not understand him and invalidate his statement by insisting he likes it. And it really doesn't take a genius to work out he meant don't do that infront of my peers. Jeez.", "NAH.\n\nSome kids get weird with physical affection in public. (And middle school kids make the nastiest jokes.) you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but he\u2019s growing up. This affection may not last forever and you might need to prepare yourself for that.\n\nEdit: this story reminds me of when my dad use to have lunch with me at school on Wednesdays. One kid made fun of me for that (I got bullied a lot due to my medical condition .)  and apparently according to my dad (I was maybe 8-10) my response was \u201csorry my dad loves me enough to eat lunch with me.\u201d", "NAH\n\nHe's getting to the point of being embarrassed by public affection from his parent.

He gave you a death stair that should be your clue that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. If someone says not to kiss them don\u2019t kiss them. Your son may still love to show affection in private but not in public especially in school.", "NTA. 6th graders are a mercurial bunch.", "NAH your kid at home vs at school is different and has different eyes on him. Come on, you were a pre teen once.", "YTA for pretending not to know the difference between hugs and kisses at home and in public. Your son is allowed to like one and not the other. He's allowed to set boundaries with you about how and when you touch his body, and you shouldn't make him feel guilty or silly about it.", "People are calling it embarrassment for having affectionate parents??? \n\nI personally feel you shouldn't stop.", "Yeah, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because it was public. Lots of teens find that super embarrassing. They get over it once they get older, usually, but maybe just be sensitive to that?  I\u2019m sure he still wants affection otherwise.", "Hugs are probably okay but not kisses. It definitely depends on the kid but in 6th grade I wouldn't want my friends to see my mom or dad giving me good boy kisses. Those are just for me and not for sharing.", "Yep. NAH.", "I'm confused by the title vs what the son said.  Am I the asshole for hugging my son?  No, the son didn't care about that.  \"Am I the asshole for kissing my middle school son in front of his whole class?\"  Has a different ring to it I guess.", "the guys an asshole for doing nothing wrong?", "Lol ridiculous take on the judgement. \n\nOf course he thinks he did nothing wrong because this is something they always do. Based on the info we have, there's no indication that this has been discussed before as something OP shouldn't do.\n\nAt worst, it's NAH. If more info revealed that the son has asked him to not do this, then it's a YTA.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m stuck on in my judgment. For one, I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t have an argument about it right there in the classroom. For two, it\u2019s nice that he asked his son about it later. But for three, it really doesn\u2019t seem like he understands his son didn\u2019t want that level of affection when in class, and I\u2019m concerned it\u2019ll reflect in later reactions to his son practicing body autonomy.", "So confused as to where you got mom from", "Awful, awful take. YTA for this comment alone, but also for not respecting your son's wishes to not have PDA.", "Wowzers. It would've been n a h, for making a one time honest mistake for not noticing your son is growing up. But you need to LISTEN to your son. He just made it VERY CLEAR he does not want your PDA while in HIS social circle. And he should have the right to decline. \n\nIF he still wants hugs and kisses, hug him at home. And ASK him if it's still okay around family. Or only when it's the two of you. Be prepared that all hugs may stop one day soon.

The older 6th grader barely says bye when he gets out of the car at school lol", "Lol, I left a comment that was super tender, and this made me laugh so hard.\n\nYes, I guess at 12 I decided it was the time to flex, push over my small brother in public so people would know I was tough and didn\u2019t roll with little kids, and basically wanted my parents to always walk 10 feet ahead of me\n\nBecause clearly at 12 it would look like I was an adult o by myself. Kids are weird!

With my middle schooler, I volunteer at their little school store that sells nicknacks, so I get to see them at lunch.  That\u2019s once a month. That\u2019s about it at the middle school level.
