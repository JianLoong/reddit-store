YTA for that alone- you seem to actually understand very little about tweenagers. No Dad, YOUR son is of an age where finding his independence is important. Growing up is important. And impressing his peers is important. He wasn\u2019t mad because his friends were jealous he\u2019s mad because he does t want to be seen as a little kid. Kudos on raising a great kid who wants to share his accomplishments with you- don\u2019t blow it by being too hard headed to respect his boundaries. Enjoy the kisses and hugs AT HOME while you still can and treat him in a way that\u2019s more respectful of his growing independence at school.", "You're not an asshole for kissing him at school one time before you knew he didn't like it. You *were* wrong to kiss him at school, he didn't want you to, and the teacher clearly saw the whole interaction. Parent volunteers shouldn't be all kissing and hugging their child during volunteer hours. Keep it the same level of professional with all the children - high fives and waves. But being wrong by accident doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nWhere you might be an asshole is dismissing his request as \"but I always kiss you\" or \"but you like it\", refusing to entertain the notion that kissing at home is fine but kissing at school is not fine, and arguing in the comments about it. If you continued to kiss him at school then you would also definitely be an asshole.", "Your kid is 11 and doesn\u2019t want to be kissed in front of other people. That\u2019s normal.

And no, his peers aren\u2019t \u201cjust jealous\u201d.\n\n\nThe whole dynamic of you being in his class is a bit weird. And I say this as a teachers kid. Generally teachers try to avoid teaching their own kids or even kids they are tutoring on the side. Volunteering in field trips is more common for parents (not always something the kids like though).", "When you are in the classroom as a volunteer, you are *not* supposed to act in the capacity of \"parent\".

He is 11 not 5.  You need to understand that he is growing up and for the next decade most PDAs between you and him are going to be cringeworthy.  It is perfectly fine and emotionally healthy to be affectionately and physically demonstrative with a preteen and teen-aged child - in private.  But in public unless it is for some big milestone or is instigated by the child, they are going to become increasingly embarrassed and put off by it.  It is part of growing up and creating their own identity.\n\nThe next potential phase - when they decide you are the most clueless person ever born - is even worse.  Fortunately, it too passes for most kids, usually around the age of 20.", "YTA based on the comments..accept that your child is growing as he should and adapt your behavior.\n\nHe did nothing wrong.

I don't envy you.  I hated that stage in my kids life.  They grow out of it eventually.  NTA.", "NAH. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't know about the boundary your son established. It happens. What matters is you respected it and you learn from it. If you're uncertain on how to proceed, just communicate with your son. Ask him what he wants and how you can respect his boundaries.", "NAH. There's nothing to analyze here, just a kid being a kid. I remember not wanting my mom or grandpa to pick me up from school or reacting badly.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like it is time to talk with him about it. Seems like he didn't inform you about his new rules, so how could you follow them. But he got upset, so there definitely is some new rule. Your boy is growing up and with him becoming a teenager these simple things will become more complicated. Good luck, haha!", "NTA! No worries man! Your son is just growing up, time to keep the cuddling and hugs with your little man at home. He'll probably still be more comfortable sharing affection in the privacy of the home instead of out in public where kids like to pick and tease each other!", "NTA, just be conscious of your surroundings in case he gets picked on. We all love to hug and kiss our kids but as they get older, you got think from their perspective as well. They got a social status to maintain. Cherish the hugs and kisses as long as you can.", "NTA, just a minor error.\n\nAs a father myself, i know that urge to hug and kiss my son and i consider myself lucky that my son (16) still likes to hug and get hugged by me.\n\nTalk with your son, tell him that you understand his situation and you will respect his boundaries. Then talk about where these boundaries exactly are and do your best to respect those boundaries.\n\nAlso know, this has nothing to do with your son loving you any less. If you do it right, this situation can even strengthen your bond and raise his respect for you. Like, what goes around, comes around. This goes also for positive things.", "NAH\n\nYour son is just growing up. Maybe just don't show him as much affection in public though.", "NTA, but mom, he ain't your baby no more. He's at that age where those kinds of public displays become embarrassing. Don't push the issue, get your hugs and kisses at home.", "NAH - it happens, sometimes kids aren\u2019t comfortable with a certain level of affection in front of their peers and at some point in every kids life, theyll find their parent \u201cembarrassing\u201d", "NAH\n\nyour kid is being a normal 11 year old. too much affection in front of his peers will embarrass him. Respect this and move on. keep communication open so he feels he can tell you when he is uncomfortable and things will be fine.", "NAH Most kids grow out of wanting their parents to kiss and hug them in public, this is normal. Be prepared for him to not even want you to get out of the car when you drop him off or pick him up.", "NAH\n\nPart of growing up. Apparently he's in the phase where PDA with your dad is cringe. He'll get over it. As long as he doesn't withdraw in public, you're fine.", "Think back to when you were that age.  Would you want the cringe of an overly affectionate parent slobbering over you in front of your teacher, friends etc?\n\nIt might be normal now but the sooner he approaches his teens, that's likely what he will think of it.\n\nNAH but let him decide.", "NAH but pay attention now that you know. Mine is 10, and I always ask before hugging or kissing him. Even at home and even though he\u2019s always loved snuggling. But he\u2019s at the age where that could change any minute, and I don\u2019t want him to resent me or feel like I\u2019m treating him like a little kid or be embarrassed/uncomfortable.

I was under strict instructions NEVER to kiss my kids goodbye when dropping them off at school once they got to about age 7 or 8. That didn't mean they didn't want affection at other times, but they are figuring out how to deal with embarrassment, and what other kids tease them about.\n\nJust take your cue from your child , if he doesn't want public displays in school, save it for home. It's not a reflection of your relationship to allow him to lead on this - in fact doing so shows you respect his autonomy.  You would very much be TA if you forced it on him in situations where he is uncomfortable with it -  even if you don't think he has a valid concern. Just show him that you will respect his decisions about how he is treated.", "NTA Welcome to puberty", "NTA, and you should laugh along with the teacher. Pre-teens are almost uniformly assholes.\n\nYour son is a 6th grader, which means he's far too cool to have parents at all, let alone one that would be proud of him or show him affection.

Just talk it out with him!", "NAH (except the teacher, but only slightly)\n\nYour son is at an age where parents are awful and embarrassing but he still loves you. That said, be aware that he has expressed boundaries and you should respect those boundaries.\n\nThe teacher seems to have misread the situation, and said completely the wrong thing here.

Lol sorry but he\u2019s growing up and social cues are needed in some instances.", "NTA but he's growing up dad, he's not gonna want affection like that in front of his friends like he used to. He still loves you i promise, he's just growing up.", "NTA. Teacher is an A though. Your son is going through a normal developmental phase. He still loves you deeply, and is just figuring out what is normal... for him. You know, weird preteen stuff. He'll probably welcome hugs in later years. Teacher had no place to give their input. \"Blew it.\"??? I would've give them a death stare and told them to STFU. I'm okay with being straightforward though.", "NAH..  \nA hug or sidehug is one thing. A kiss is totally different in the eyes of his classmates. So while he might like it at home that last one, is not something most teens would like where classmates are present.   \n\n\nYou should have a little sit down talk with him about what and what not to do at school, and his level of comfort in the case of classmates who are around.", "NTA. he's so lucky he has you... my parents only hit me lol. I wish I had had that.", "NTA- Nope, you're doing it exactly right. The hunting call of the healthy, well raised tween or teen is \"You're sooooooooooooo embaaaaaaaaarassiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing.\" Translation: My friends must not know I totally love my mummy/daddy as it will ruin the iceberg like cool I hope one day to cultivate!", "First offNTA. Second, now that your guy is in middle school everything from the way you breathe to the fact that you have the audacity to exist will make you the a$$\u2026.it comes and goes.", "The title is misleading. He wasnt objecting to the hug. He objected to the kiss in front of his friends. He may be fine to do so at home and love the affection, but kids that age want to play it cool around their friends.\n\nSoft YTA because it was a celebration.", "NAH. He\u2019s just at that age.", "You need to be careful your son if approaching a stage of his life that can really confuse him when a mother acts like you do  be careful very very careful", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s 11. . . \u2018Nough said, lol\n\nBut really he\u2019s trying to look \u201ccool\u201d and you are trying to show affection, I\u2019d say the kiss might have been a bit too much, but honestly if this is the worst you deal with, y\u2019all are great.", "You'll be the asshole if you force kisses on him in front of his friends. He told you not to do that anymore so don't do it. He's growing up and you have to respect his boundaries. You don't have to avoid kissing him altogether; just don't do it in front of his friends. It's not just about what you want.", "NTA. You baby is growing up. Be proud! Just look to him for cues of what kinds of affection he wants in different situations. It will be a learning curve for you both as he matures.", "This is typical preteen behavior. Gone are the days of the little kid running to greet you.", "YTA. His friends are jealous? I'm getting very strong \"no other woman is going to be good enough\" vibes from you. He made it clear to back off in public. Done.", "I got to the 'they're just jealous' comment and I... oh no. YTA. It's a school environment not at home, respect his boundaries", "NTA he\u2019s just teaching that age where he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cbabied\u201d or embarrassed. I remember how hurt my mom looked when I told her I didn\u2019t want her waiting at the bus stop with me anymore.", "This. A lot of people, regardless of age, don't like public display of affection.", "why u gotta word it like so aggressive it aint that srs.", "His friends are not looking and they don't care. If they do then they're just jealous", "Yeah. In sixth grade having mom or dad give me a kiss on the head in public woulda been like getting kicked in the balls in front of my crush.", "When my son was little and I\u2019d drop him off at preschool he asked me to stop kissing him goodbye, ouch! But we changed it to a big high-five and that was good for him and even his friends got in on it.  We have to meet our kids where they are, at the sons age it\u2019s appropriate for him to start pulling away a little, it\u2019s hard for parents though.  I\u2019m with you, NAH", "Exactly. This is normal developmental behavior. Your son's setting boundaries - make sure to respect them!", "It\u2019s funny, I have the exact same comment, but total YTA. \n\nOP got downvoted 200+ times for waving away her son not wanting pda, in the comments below.", "Many children have two working parents, come from single parent households", "Someone at school might be giving him grief about it too.", "OP is the dad", "Do schools no longer have parents who come volunteer at classes from time to time? I feel like I knew every one of my class mates' mom and dad because seemingly all of them volunteered at one time or another. I went to private school though so maybe I'm way off base here", "Agreed. The action in itself did not make him an AH. But YTA for just dismissing your kid\u2019s wishes.", "I\u2019d bet there\u2019s a history of this behavior from OP. Why else?", "He\u2019s the dad. Not sure if that makes it worse or not", "I'm simply asking the question and offering advice.  Any assumptions of tone are on your end.", "Well that earns YTA.\n\nFirst stop patting yourself on the back for how you're a better dad than all the rest.\n\nNext you're dismissing your son's clues on what he is comfortable with in his social setting.  Read the room superdad.  Wait til you see how much things change across the next 5 years.", "It's not that they did see, it's that they COULD HAVE seen. I too don't like PDA because it gives me anxiety. You're also making a huge assumption saying \"they don't care\". Kids are vicious with bullying these days over literally anything so assumptions are never safe. Respect his boundaries.", "Jealous of\u2026 what?", "You embarrassed him. He may have gotten teased for it. Do you not remember being a child at all?", "This means:\n\n - you don't care about his feelings about it \n - you don't care about professionalism on the job \n - you don't care about how you make the other students feel. \n\nClear cut YTA here.  Hug/kiss him at home.  Not while you're over his class.", "YTA", "Jealous of what? A dad not respecting his son\u2019s publicly stated boundaries? Nobody is jealous of that.", "tHeYrE jUsT JeALoUS\n\n\nSpoiler alert: they're not \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s the perceived reality or possibility someone will see or care and think he\u2019s \u201cimmature\u201d or a \u201cbaby\u201d. It subjects him to possible bullying. It\u2019s a survival technique in the wild jungle that is middle school. \n\nI am a new mom. I just reached a point where babe only wants me during nap, bedtime and when she\u2019s overstimulated. She\u2019s moving into fun dad territory, now. I know how you feel. Phases and stages are sad. And I am sure by now, you\u2019ve experienced A LOT. but you got through those. And you\u2019ll get through this one \ud83d\ude0a", "I was originally gonna say no one was the ass hole here but like another poster said this comment earns a big fat YTA. If your son says it makes him uncomfortable doing it on public like that then that\u2019s the end of it, respect your sons boundaries. If his own parents disregard his feelings/boundaries how are you going to expect him to know when to stand up for himself and say something when someone else does?", "What matters is that YOUR SON CARES. Nobody is jealous of your son for getting your affection. Don't be a narcissist.", "Ew. They're jealous of you kissing your son??? Such a bizarre comment.", "What is with this response?\n\nYour son is getting older and doesn\u2019t want mom/dad embarrassing him in front of his friends", "Well now it's YTA, seriously this is the start of the age when most kids would rather have people think they sprang into existence fully formed like Athena from the head of Zeus than acknowledge mom or dad in public and the more you go out of your way to ignore their boundaries the worse you make it", "Misleading title: should remove Hugging with Kissing. \n\nHe asked you to not do it, so don\u2019t do it", "Congrats, you just crossed over from what sounded like an innocent slip up to \u2018Well that\u2019s fucking weird\u2019", "They might not be looking and they might not care. But your son does care. It's a normal part of being that age. Mom and dad can be embarrassing at that age and from personal experience having been male my whole life, tween and teen years are a cluster fuck of emotions and hormones all over the place. \n\nListen carefully. It's no reflection on you as a parent or how much your child loves you if they don't want you to act towards them in a certain way in public. I loved and do love my parents. But if mom or dad had kissed me in front of my friends at age 11 I would have absolutely fuckin died.\n\nNow listen more carefully. Your child's feelings matter more than yours, especially right now. Respect his bodily autonomy.", "You may think they aren't looking, but they are noticing. He's going through a normal stage of development where it is totally normal not to want public shows of affection. Respect his growing autonomy and keep the hugs and kisses for home and stick to high fives or fist bumps in public.", "LOL. Come on man. HE cares, obviously.", "You were so close to N A H and then decided to throw it in the trash", "Lol tell me you don't remember how vicious kids are at that age without telling me.", "Well, now YTA. He\u2019s definitely at the age where you are going to embarrass him for this in public. It\u2019s normal.", "The opinion that matters here is your son's. If he doesn't want PDA in public, then you don't do that.", "My parents used to make me wear weird clothes like super short shorts for a boy. (Cultural difference). I got made fun of by my classmates and my parents would say the classmates were just jealous of my clothes. I was not that delusional.", "Ew. He\u2019s not your boyfriend. You\u2019re embarrassing him.", "You are for sure going to be a jnmil spoken about by some poor woman in the future", "YTA\u2014 your son clearly cares. \n\nI was strong on no AH here until this comment.", "This is not a good response. You need to be thinking about this from your son's perspective.  What you want isn't the priority here.  Put him first - YTA", "I didn\u2019t think you were the A from the original post because you just acted in the moment but it\u2019s unfair to deliberately dismiss his feelings and boundaries about affection in front of his friends and classmates now you know he\u2019s uncomfortable. I understand you\u2019re close but there\u2019s a time and place to show that and at school he wants some space that you should respect. Seeking independence is just a natural part of growing up. How he feels should be more important than showing off, for you to say his classmates are just jealous comes across as immature.", "But he does care. It makes him uncomfortable and rules around consent are an important thing to teach to young boys. It means you need to respect his bodily autonomy as part of setting an example.", "And you just moved into the YTA. \n\nThey are looking and your son cares. Start respecting him and treating him as a young adult. It is now not about what you want but about what he wants. 11 is a tough age and bullying is real - as is peer pressure. Don't feed into it by making your son a target (hint - you are).", "Oh, well now YTA", "Your son has bodily autonomy. If he said he didn't want to be kissed, then he didn't want to be kissed. Ask him what his boundaries are, for private and public, and if you want to kiss him then ask him first so he can give you a yes or no. It's really not that complicated, just because he's a kid doesn't mean he doesn't deserve respect", "YTA for this stance. \n\nWhat is appropriate and enjoyed in one setting may be inappropriate and uncomfortable in another setting. I know you know this, because it\u2019s basic social norms. How would you feel if you had a big, successful presentation at work, and your parent who was there decided to congratulate you and give you a kiss on the noggin in front of all your coworkers? It would be weird and awkward, right?\n\nYour kid is growing into a more adult phase of life, and this phase has different boundaries. Respect those boundaries just as you would want them respected for you.", "Your kid told you he doesn't like it. Listen to him. If you're confused about when he is and isn't comfortable with physical affection, ask him. He's 11 years old, not a toddler, he can tell you what he wants.", "Oof, you were *so close* to this being a NAH situation, but you're clearly being an AH if you're choosing not to take his thoughts into consideration.", "Oh boy. OP, I thought this was a NAH situation until I saw this comment, because while you did make your son uncomfortable, it sounds like you did your best to clear it up with him later (I don't see that you actually apologized, but it also sounded like he basically told you there was no need to). But this dismissive attitude here is not a good look.\n\nLike many parents on this sub, I think you are asking the wrong question. Dismissing your son's (probable) concerns about how his peers perceive him does make you a bit of an AH, but the real question is, what relationship do you want with your son and will your current approach allow you to get it? If what you want is a relationship where you treat him however you want and he likely starts to avoid you as much as he can, at least in public, well, you're probably on the right track. If you want your relationship with him as he gets older to be mutually affectionate and close, you've got to start showing him more respect.", "If your son doesn\u2019t want you to initiate physical affection that is his choice. Consent to be touched is not just something between romantic partners, you need to be respectful of his bodily autonomy.", "YTA if this is your response. Your kid obviously has different boundaries at school compared to at home. Not hard to respect them. Quit\nMaking this about you and worry about what your son wants", "Cool story, bro. He still wants you to stop kissing him at school. Respect his wishes.", "OMG. It's not about friends' motivation, it's about your son's feelings and him wanting to keep a certain image among his peers. Like it or not, it can be *very* important to an 11-year old. I'm shocked that you belittle the issue like this.", "a typical reaction from kids, as other kids can be quite brutal with comments and teasing.", "a few years and then he'll get cool again. Good luck!\n\nNAH", "Thank you for pointing that out - I was going to incorrectly vote N A H as well but that comment definitely changes things!\n\nBut note that OP is the dad.", "I graduated in 2002 and not one of my classes had a parent volunteer or teachers aid.", "Many children have two working parents, come from single parent households, or blended families. So no, parents are no longer able to volunteer in schools as much as they did in the past.", "I went in regularly when my child was in infants school (ages 5 to 7 or so in UK), the next level up within primary schools (approx 8-10/11 would still have parents going in at times) but once you get to senior school from 11 onwards, no i don't think parents normally do in UK.  I'm not really familiar with how old kids are in grade 6 is, but from the description of hugging them, I thought they were quite young.", "My son is in elementary school and they often ask for volunteers to help with field trips and class parties. He\u2019s in public school! I volunteered for valentines and ALL the kids knew who\u2019s mom I was lol so it still happens just maybe not as common.", "No kidding. Why do people forget or dismiss that children are people too? They have just as much, if not more rights to set boundaries and tell people that they are not comfortable with something. Disrespect those boundaries and see how fast your children pull away from you.", "This part. Superdad is so great he can\u2019t understand the social cues from his kid.", "Just wanted to say that next 5 year comment had me laughing so hard. This dad is not ready for what's coming at all", "OP is YTA for not only this comment but the misleading title. OP\u2019s son didn\u2019t have a problem with the hug but with the kiss.", "100% this. Plus\n\n> so I volunteer in one of his classes a couple of days a week. \n\nYou are there as extra help in the class for all students and should not be singling out your own son.", "OP is the kid's dad.", "I remember a few, but they were careful to not have the aid in the same classroom as one of their kids, unless the kid was really little.", "Both my parents worked full time jobs and still found time to come volunteer. Your other reasons make sense to me.", "And he has a son. Good thing it isn't a daughter. Girls this age tend to be even more self-conscious.", " Other than that it seems to me that you both handled this well and it\u2019s not a big deal, so I think this AITA post is weird."]}
