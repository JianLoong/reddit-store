For years I was polite, even when I was being patronised or he was invading our privacy or openly belittling our choices. About 2 years ago, my daughter decided to be a vegetarian and he was just a dick about it: laughed at her, told she was dumb etc etc. And I just stopped being civil. I now avoid him like the plague - if left in a room with him alone, I leave it. When he makes comments about something we've done, I no longer smile and ignore but question his right to pass an opinion etc. To be honest, he hasn't really changed but at least I don't feel like I'm condoning his actions anymore. So it's a NTA from me. Sometimes, you just gotta give back the energy given to you.", "NTA, but sounds like you have a husband problem as well. He should be standing up for you, NOT just \"understanding\" why you respond the way you do. He needs to speak to  his mother and let her know her behavior is unacceptable.
