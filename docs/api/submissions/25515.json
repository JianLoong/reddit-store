No child support, alimony, debt or big loans. I know bec. he doesnt hide his payslip, investment statements, etc. He gave me proof of his assets when we submitted immigration papers. He's just a tightwad.\n\nI was expecting access to funds for the household expenses, not everything he has. I asked to make me an extension of his card in the meantime but got a big NO. He buys groceries but tailored for what he likes. During the times I asked grocery money, he once gave $20 for a week and had the gall to ask for change. Once he gave me $60 and i had to itemize what i bought. The times he brought me to an Asian grocery to buy what i want/need it ended with scrutinizing the cart. Those trips felt i need to hail him for the grand effort.\n\nIm upset because of the indignity of having literally nothing. Again, not for crazy expenses. There are days when i like a cup of coffee to unwind, a cheap pair of shoes, a new book. I dont even consider them luxury, its for mental health. I feel bad lying to friends I cant join a simple lunch bec. i dont have money (he said up to me to find funds if i want to do something like that). He said he knew me as a strong independent woman. When we met i was employed!\n\nIve been confronting him but i end up crying and made to feel its my fault not saving enough to cover this period until I can work again. He tells me this each time. He insists its not as if im paying for necessities (rent, electricity, wifi, cable). He thinks providing the bare minimum is enough.\n\nI just tell myself when i can work & earn my own money i wont feel this bad. He said hes not expecting me to share half when the time comes. But this period of waiting isnt good for me mentally. I feel undignified not only about the unmet needs but feeling theres no \"we/us\" in this situation. Asking an allowance as a wife feels so WTF already. Im a partner not a child.\n\nSo AITA for hating on spouse who isnt giving me money or am i just being entitled?

He is abusive! Divorce and go back home please. As soon as you start working, he would expect you to use all the money to pay bills at home", "OH HELL NO!! NTA\n\nI am in the EXACT same position as you. I had a very successful career back home but we made the decision that it would be better in the long term for me to move to the USA. I arrived during Covid and my immigration process took 2 years. In that time I had no right to work in the country. When I finally did I struggled to find any work because I \u201cdon\u2019t have American experience\u201d. We were then in a bad car accident that left me unable to walk properly or use my right arm. I\u2019m now on my fourth year of being unemployed after earning 6 figures before I moved to this place. In that time I was eating through my savings. My husband kept insisting I use our joint bank account but I felt such anxiety about being financially dependent on him. After the car accident I caved and stopped using my money entirely. I have always had access to all his money, we have a budget and discuss any big purchases before we make them.\n\nAdditionally, I have my own savings that I keep separately for emergencies (I am of the opinion that every woman should have enough money stashed away to leave an abusive relationship. I have enough for Ubers, hotel room, 3 months rent if need be and a plane ride back home to my family). You need to figure out a way to get some money. Are your family or friends able to help you? \n\nHe is the reason you are in the country - he actually has the responsibility legally as he sponsored you to come to this country. He has to support you financially beyond just the bare minimum of shelter and food. Like you said - it\u2019s things like sanitary pads! If you came on a k-1 visa or are applying for permanent green card you two need to be on the deed of the house/rental agreement, have to have joint finances and be on bills together. You need to show an intermingling of finances otherwise immigration will say your marriage is not genuine. You can raise this with him as well and see if that gets him to change. \n\nThat aside, you\u2019re married. It sounds cruel and in my opinion, financially abusive to not allow you access to marital funds when you have no job. He is trying to control you through money. This does not bode well for your relationship. You have no support system and are in a vulnerable position. Immigration has lots of ways to support women who find themselves in sticky situations after they migrated to the USA. The power imbalance can bring out the worst in some people, unfortunately. \n\nI would recommend writing out how you are feeling and sit down and talk it out. If it\u2019s easier to read it out to him then do it that way - if talking makes you cry. \n\nIf nothing changes then you need to be honest with yourself that this relationship is not what you hoped for and it might be time to move on. If you still want to stay in the country there are ways you can do it - there are free legal clinics and services that would help you. If it comes to that make sure you have all your immigration documents and a paper trail and evidence of his controlling behaviour.", "NTA.

I\u2019m not going to tell you to leave him because i don\u2019t know why you got married and all that. BUT if you decide to continue this marriage than you will have to prepare yourself for the future. Until you\u2019re work authorization comes through try dog walking, babysitting, yard work, etc. You could put flyers up around your community. I like going to thrift stores and garage sales and getting items for next to nothing and then fixing them up and reselling. No matter what happens make sure that once you get working again you squirrel away as much money as you can in an account that only you know about and only you have access to. Save as much as you possibly can.
