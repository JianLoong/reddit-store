Need help since this is driving me insane, it was my (38M) wife's (38F) birthday last week and I had a problem I never expected. We have 1 child and a tight budget, but we both work so we are able to get by fine. For her birthday, she asked for athletic sandals. Pretty much it. Ok..all good. I went to store and picked out a sweet pair of Teva's and wrapped them up. For her actual present tho. I got us a night out in NH in a nice waterfront hotel. She has never been to this city in New Hampshire and we have talked about it a few times. When her birthday came, I gave her her sandals while she was eating her breakfast and when she opened them she hated them. LOL! Oh well, I was upset at first, but im a guy, I cant take offense if she didn't like them. I thought they were cool, whatever! No biggie.\n\nThat should have been a warning flag, but continued on. Later in the day I let her in on the details of our trip and I thought she was excited at first. However, as the days came after her bday, she started asking me questions like, how much was the hotel? Are there free cancelations?..etc. I obviously hated these questions so I tossed it to the side, because I thought it was obnoxious. As we are now getting closer she has asked a few times if ive called the hotel, if there are cancelations, and that she just wants to know what she is doing this weekend. Well I know what IM DOING.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt came to a head when she was on the phone with her SIL the other night and when asked what she was doing this weekend, I heard her say \"well (husband) thinks he is Bobby Big Bucks and got us a hotel for the night in NH)\" This REALLY pissed me off and I let her know that.\n\nWhen I finally unpissed myself enough to check in on the reservation the free cancelation day came and went. So Im committed.\n\nI told my wife this and she has been radio silent today. Its driving me insane. I dont know where she got so entitled and Im not sure why she has decided she doesnt want to go here. My wife is a traveler, every weekend we need to be going somewhere or doing something, its just the way she is. I thought what a better gift idea than to spend time together.\n\nAn important note, she buys me trips for every birthday/christmas. Its what she does. I rarely get tangible gifts, and we go places together. I love it!Thats why I thought I could do the same! Wooops!\n\nAITA for wanting to tell my wife to stay home and ill just go by myself? I feel like her control issues are at play here or something. I have no idea but I dont know how to handle it.  \n\n\nEDIT: I am DEF the asshole for not contacting the hotel right away when she asked about cancelation. When she first asked, I blew it off because I didn't take her seriously. I thought she was just having a bad day because she loves travel and wanted to go to this city. That was a dick move, if she didnt want to go I should have called right away. \n \nUpdate: ITA. I got home and my wife apologized for how she acted, but was just anxious about money. She\u2019s a teacher and hasn\u2019t been paid all summer so she said she was holding anxiety about it and when I brought up free cancelation she just got a little wrapped up in what we could do for less money, and worried less about how that made me feel. I apologized for not discussing this with her prior to booking and dismissing her valid financial concerns.

The times earlier in our relationship when I tried to surprise her with a trip did not go well - she either got sick right before the trip, or had an issue with the hotel, or wanted to make sure I got the right rate and would cancel the trip over small details. Early on, this bugged me, but I know I have my own quirks as well. I give her other types of gifts, but absolutely understand that she does not appreciate huge surprises (trip or otherwise) and for her, a huge part of the fun of travelling is planning the trip. \n\nBut having been in a similar boat, I understand your frustration.

She does not want to go now. You ignored her.", "I just repeated your story back to you, dude.  If that's not how it went down, you should have written it differently.  And you arguing about it doesn't make you look any better.", "I feel for you in a way bc I can see my husband doing this. Getting me something I asked for (sandals) but in a style I would never pick. Then planning a get a way in the least financially and savvy way possible to a place I really want to go. \n\nLike we were talking about taking a week off over the summer to hang with the kids. He text me a travel package through Costco to go to Universal that week. He knows I'm dying to go to universal. But he also knows we are not in a financial place to do that. And it's not how I want to do universal (I've told him my plans many times). But to him it's something nice and he's thinking of me. To me it's crazy bc we don't have the money and it's not even how I want to do it. \n\nJust try to listen to your wife more and ask her questions. Like, why do you feel that way? When she made the comment about cancelling. Could have avoided this all.", "Good points!", "Sincerely, I give you credit for being legit open to it and acknowledging it instead of digging in. Good luck!", "ESH. There's obviously more going on than what's being posted about, and you guys don't know how to communicate with each other.", "YTA. \n\nHer comment to SIL makes it clear why too, so I\u2019m not possible sure how or why you\u2019re still confused. \n\nShe\u2019s pissed that you spent that kind of money when money is already tight. She feels like you\u2019re being irresponsible with money. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even hard to figure out so how you missed the obvious is beyond me.", "I feel like something is missing here. At no point did you ask her why she was hesitant about going?", "NTA. If she wanted you to cancel it then she should have said so.", "I\u2019m too lazy to read all the replies, but if you haven\u2019t taken the trip yet, call the hotel and ask to reschedule for a later date.  Then wait a day or two and cancel\nfor free.", "As soon as she asked about the cancellation he should have had a conversation about it, while he still had time to cancel.       \nHe's acting shocked he can't cancel now its too late but she mentioned it straight away.", "right, in his mind its like he thought his gift was too perfect so hes in denial as soon as things go off the rails", "And mot just the room. How are they getting there? Where's the money to eat coming from. Way more expense to a trip than the cost of the room.", "YTA.  At the very least for not checking on the cancellation policy, AFTER your wife asked you several times to do so and you ignored it. And then treat the fact that the day has come and gone as fait accompli. Pathetic. \n\nSecondly, the word entitled is generally associated with spending money one doesn\u2019t have - not trying to save some. I cannot believe you are blaming your wife for trying to be fiscally responsible. Especially when it has to do with her own birthday celebration. \n\nFinally, the birthday is HERS. Your feelings about her gift should not take precedent over how she feels about it.  So stop throwing a tantrum, apologise to your wife for being both an AH and an idiot, and in the future, learn to actually listen when your wife communicates. Burying your head in the sand or putting your fingers in your ears won\u2019t help.  Asking for a cancellation should have sparked a conversation as to WHY. Maybe also a slight fail on her part for not saying exactly why, but the kinds of questions she was asking made it pretty clear for anybody who wanted to listen.", "Teva makes a nice sandal.  She should have told him which ones she wanted.", "Teva sandals are for walking.  They make some aethestically pleasing ones too.  A pretty decent one:  https://www.teva.com/women-flip-flops/mush-mandalyn-wedge-ola-2/1000099.html", "How is he an asshole about the sandals?  Tevas are good sandals.  If she wanted a specific pair, she *should have said so*.", "Tevas are ugly as hell.\nAnd first, there are no proof she have not said, op has a history of ignoring his wife, and second- he could have asked at least type of sandals", "I don\u2019t see how she made it clear.  She asked and hinted but didn\u2019t make it clear.", "Even if the hotel is paid for the transportation to and from, food, entertainment, and childcare aren\u2019t.", "Or, she could have specified.  She *did* say what kind of sandals.  Athletic sandals.\n\nIt is your *opinion* that tevas are ugly.  Either way they are quality sandals and not some cheap shit.", "YTA. Ffs, this post gave me anxiety and I don't even know you. \n\nShe asked for SANDALS! And you didn't even managed to get some she liked! That's not a 'warning flag', it's a human reacting to something that has happened. No *human* should be *offended* that they failed to get their partner a good gift, so hold your toxic sexism on that point. \nThis is why god invented gift reciepts.\n\nAnd holy. Moly. Buying a weekend away for her birthday without consulting her? Why? Does she even want to go to NH? Do you care? Or are you too busy jerking off about how good your present is gonna be to hear her very clearly and repeatedly state she DOESN'T. WANT IT.?\n\nAs soon as she asked about refunds I could've told you she was concerned about the expense. Hell, the potential was there from when she asked for sandals. Why does an internet stranger hear your wife 2nd hand better than you hear her face to face?\n\nThat poor woman just got handed a big sack of anxiety, guilt and regret. No present is worth an ounce of shit if it causes the recipient stress. You failed and your attitude sucks. Luckily, these things can be fixed. Tell your wife I said happy birthday, then take her to pick out her own sandals. Get 2 pairs.", "> She's a teacher and hasn't been paid all summer...\n\nTeachers don't get paid in the summer months in the US?", "The thing is: I also wish for a lot of things. I wish for a new car. I wish for a nice vacation. I wish for some new clothes instead of having to buy my maternity stuff second hand. \n\nAnd I would be BEYOND PISSED if my fianc\u00e9 gifted me a new car or a luxury vacation *because we cannot afford it*. \n\nIdly wishing for something doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d be happy if he got it for me! It\u2019s more something of a \u201eoh if someday we had money we would\u2026\u201c"]}
