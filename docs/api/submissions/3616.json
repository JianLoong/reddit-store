Yes, this is a hard situation for you and your family but your husband is 100% at fault and easily could have killed innocent people. Omitting the fact that he was drunk is lying to everyone and akin to fraud.

What he did is unacceptable in any circumstance. Many innocent people are seriously injured or killed by drunk drivers every year, including people I know.

And now people are angry at you because they can't be angry at your husband right now, and in itself it sounds unfair. \n\nHowever i can totally see why some people would not help out while knowing the truth, and some people maybe donated money without having much themselves, while they would not have if they add this extra information. I think you fucked up when you actively tried to supress the proof. You should have owned up to it, and explains that they have every right to be furious against your husband, but that right now you need help because the sole bread winner is out and you have three kids to feed. YOU and YOUR KIDS are in a shitty situation because of HIS actions. And it may be your husband but i think it's important to explain this to others, and not defend your husband, i mean seriously i know he is in a bad place right now but he puts himself here and it could have been much worse, excusing his behavior only the slightest will make people rightfully mad. You have deeper issues to deal with. Also he will live and will get to hear what people have to say to him anyway, so right now focus on making it clear that you need help.

He was out with friends on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving and crashed his car on his way home.  He had a compound fracture of one of his femurs, a concussion, and also some significant internal injuries.  By the grace of God he survived, but he is still in the hospital.  He's already had multiple surgeries and will have many more to come, but he is at least stable and his doctors think the worst is behind us.  \n\nMy husband is the sole breadwinner for our family.  I am a SAHM to our 3 kids.  We have insurance, but these medical bills are going to add up really fast and without his income, we are going to need a lot of help.  So, I set up a GoFundMe to ask for donations.\n\nI've been very grateful for all the help that our family and friends have given us so far.  It's going to go a long way to help our family get through this very difficult time.  Especially since this is going to be a long road to recovery.  \n\nI posted an update on my Facebook that his most recent surgery was a success and to again thank everyone that has donated and helped our family in other ways during this time.  But one of my \"friends\" commented that he thinks it's BS that I'm asking for all this money without letting people know the truth that my husband was driving drunk when he crashed his car.  \n\nThat same \"friend\" commented on every post I have made about my husband's crash.  He said a bunch of stuff about how lucky my family is that my husband didn't hurt anyone else and that I'm omitting the information about him being drunk because otherwise people wouldn't be giving us money.\n\nI had to delete a bunch of posts because of this and blocked that \"friend.\"  But I've gotten a lot of angry calls and texts from people telling me that I was wrong to leave that information out because I'm purposely misleading people into helping us.\n\nThis has added an extra layer of stress when I am already at my limit.  I'm just trying to keep my family together during the worst time of our lives.  My husband was barely clinging to life and even though that fear is mostly behind us, I know that our lives are going to be forever changed.  \n\nI know he was wrong to drive in that condition, I'm not debating that.  I'm incredibly thankful that no one else was hurt.  But I can't go back and change my husband's decisions.  I can only look forward and pray for the best.  \n\nI've had to block so many people because of all the hateful comments and messages.  Thankfully, I still have a solid support network who are helping us in so many different ways.  I know my husband made a terrible decision, but I don't think that means we are less deserving of help.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
