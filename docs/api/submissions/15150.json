However, it is illegal for you to keep her money, that would be stealing. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems that your daughter wants to grieve away from you, and your house, which is probably full of painful reminders of her old life.

A life insurance payout doesn\u2019t just show up \u2018unexpectedly\u2019.

It would also not be part of any will. \n\nYou would also not receive your daughter\u2019s life insurance payout as she is an adult beneficiary. Unless you knowingly committed fraud.", "YTA. If your daughter is named as beneficiary for the life insurance you are going to be in legal trouble. Your daughter knows she's named in the will and at some point will seek legal advice. I'm sorry for your troubles but you cannot arbitrarily decide not to give your daughter the money. You best course would be to sit down with her and discuss how to give her the money. You legally cannot withhold it. Don't get yourself in further trouble.", "Unfortunately, YTA. She's 18 and you can't protect her from herself. All you can do is be there for her when she's ready.

She will blow through it in no time and when she gets older will ask you why on earth you let her squander her inheritance when she was clearly unstable. Sorry, Mom--you get the wrath of Emily at either end of this no matter what you do.  Hopefully she will grow and mature enough to understand why it was important to safeguard the money.  If invested wisely, it could set her up for retirement.  I would look around for some free legal aid and find out if there is some legal provision where the money could be put in a trust for Emily until she is 21 or so, and has hopefully gained the wisdom and maturity to invest it wisely.
