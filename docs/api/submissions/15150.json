However, it is illegal for you to keep her money, that would be stealing. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems that your daughter wants to grieve away from you, and your house, which is probably full of painful reminders of her old life.

A life insurance payout doesn\u2019t just show up \u2018unexpectedly\u2019.

It would also not be part of any will. \n\nYou would also not receive your daughter\u2019s life insurance payout as she is an adult beneficiary. Unless you knowingly committed fraud.", "YTA. If your daughter is named as beneficiary for the life insurance you are going to be in legal trouble. Your daughter knows she's named in the will and at some point will seek legal advice.

You legally cannot withhold it. Don't get yourself in further trouble.", "Unfortunately, YTA. She's 18 and you can't protect her from herself. All you can do is be there for her when she's ready.

She will blow through it in no time and when she gets older will ask you why on earth you let her squander her inheritance when she was clearly unstable. Sorry, Mom--you get the wrath of Emily at either end of this no matter what you do.  Hopefully she will grow and mature enough to understand why it was important to safeguard the money.  If invested wisely, it could set her up for retirement.  I would look around for some free legal aid and find out if there is some legal provision where the money could be put in a trust for Emily until she is 21 or so, and has hopefully gained the wisdom and maturity to invest it wisely.

Why bring up her own finances at all in this post if her reasoning is actually caring about her kid?

Life insurance and a will/estate are separate things, and life insurance can't be given in a will because the person writing the will very literally doesn't have that money.", "That\u2019s a different thing.

My Dad died unexpectedly almost seven years ago; we submitted the death certificate to his life insurance company and the insurance payment was disbursed within a couple of weeks. There was also an unexpected extra $5000 with it because of an additional policy we had thought was canceled but was not. \n\nPlus I'm betting that the daughter's payment was sent to the same home address as the mother, and I don't trust this mother not to have intercepted it.", "My mom died and we got her life insurance quickly because the obituary had been published", "OP never said that she spent the money. Also this has been the current situation only since yesterday according to the post. Not a lot of time to make the perfect choice when OP is also greiving. I also never said that I think OP should continue to hang on to the money. I just feel like OP's judgement of her daughter's potential risky behaviors while in a mental health crisis were made in good faith, hoping to protect her daughter.", "Not entirely true.  A policy holder can gift/transfer a their life insurance to a designated recipient through a will.", "She was a beneficiary. I look over her bank account. I was going to stop when she turned 18. But I havnt. She is legally owed the money. But as a mother. I just can't see how giving her a whole chunk of money is going to be good for her right now.", "Actually almost every single time this issue has been litigated  the opposite is true. If the policy has a means of changing the beneficiary that the decedent could have used but didn't, even if they try to gift it in their will it doesn't actually matter. The named beneficiary controls. There may another reason to disqualify a named beneficiary or you may have a situation where someone started the changeover process and died before it was completed - those would be different.

She isn't getting the money from you.\n\nInstead you, the last remaining immediate family, are cutting ties with her by stealing the money from her.\n\nYou're saying she shouldn't make big money decisions because she's in a bad mental state.

The only option is give her the money. Contact a lawyer but they will tell you the same thing. But until then let\u2019s count the felonies:\n\n1- if the check was in her name.

If so, did son's portion go to you as his next of kin?  I find it strange that you keep saying that she \"was a beneficiary\" but I don't see you saying that you were also.\n\nAnd it is true that a will has nothing to do with a life insurance policy.  The will could say that he left everything to his wife, but the life insurance could have a totally different beneficiary.  Like insurance payouts are not part of his estate.", "It wouldn't be.

You are not only the asshole here, what you're doing is *incredibly* illegal.

Emily could get you in a huge amount of legal trouble if she goes to an attorney. \n\nGiving her the money may not be good for her, you're correct. But you have absolutely zero right to do anything else here. If she makes poor decisions with that money, that is on her but it is *her* money to do with as she pleases.

Get a lawyer and a therapist, you need to self care you have been through such a terrible thing.", "That sucks, but you can\u2019t do this. Morally, I get what you\u2019re trying to do and the timing of it, with her just turning 18, makes this incredibly difficult. But you have to give her that money. Now, I think it still makes sense to sit her down to discuss why you\u2019re worried about this, and try to get her to think about how she\u2019s going to spend this money. When you don\u2019t have responsibilities and you feel like you have a hole inside, it\u2019s easy to try to fill it with things, especially when you suddenly have money. It may help to have a lawyer explain to her that once she gets the money and whatever else is in the will, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not an unceasing fountain of protection the way you and your husband have been, it\u2019s a final gift. It might help to have someone \u201cofficial\u201d tell her that once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone and remind her that she has the legal right to it because she\u2019s 18, but that cuts both ways: you also don\u2019t have to provide for her while she\u2019s grieving through recklessness. Hard though it may be to say that, it may be what she needs to hear. It\u2019s tough because she\u2019s hurting right now and no one would want her to feel doubly abandoned, but she may need to be reminded that she shouldn\u2019t use this money to fuel a spiral.", "If she is a beneficiary of the life insurance, you are legally obligated to pay get that money, asap.  She would have a legitimate case against you if you didn\u2019t pay out and she took you to court.  You could also be on the hook for her court costs and possibly punitive damages like emotional distress and lawyer fees.  Cut her a cashier\u2019s or bank check and be done with it.
