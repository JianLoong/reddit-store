If they can show that you trash talk them, if they have proof, or can show instances that makes your actions questionable, you may not get the right to jack crap. Nevermind the fact that legally, they could move that child halfway around the world and the expense for visiting would be on you. The rights of a grandparent don't equal parental rights. So tread carefully. That is all I am saying. Also, best hope your house is shatter proof because if there was abuse or neglect of daughter in the past that can be proven and used for her reason to cut ties...they are not going to grant you rights that would be detrimental to the child's parents.
