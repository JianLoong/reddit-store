{"id": 19812, "submission_id": "14aw0cn", "title": "AITA for exposing my half-sister's lies about our childhood?", "selftext": "I (24F) have a half-sister (27F), we'll call her Taylor.\n\nMy dad had weekend visitation with Taylor at our house until I was 8, and it was the worst. She bullied me really badly any time I saw her, to the point that I would scream every time my dad even mentioned her coming over. Even if we were kept apart, she would break my things, upset my pets, and tell lies about me. Every week her mom would end up in the kitchen screaming at my parents.\n\nTaylor's mom died when she was 11. Her mom didn't have any family able to take her in, and nor did my dad. My dad was the only one who could get custody.\nWhen I was told about this, I freaked out. Screaming, crying for hours, calling my grandparents and demanding to live with them, all of it. My mom wasn't willing to have Taylor in the house on that basis, and I'm pretty sure she said she would move out if my dad pushed the issue. Taylor ended up being sent to boarding school the next year, and she would go to stay with other members of my dad's family during breaks. When I was 14 my parents divorced, and I would see Taylor every few months at my dad's during school breaks. I'd learnt to stand up for myself and she'd grown up so there was no bullying, but we'd bicker - she was hostile and I never backed down. I didn't see her much after she went to college, and then I went to college far away as well.\n\nWe now live in the same small city (I moved here in March). It's the kind of place where everyone from each generation knows or knows of each other. I had never encountered Taylor socially and never mentioned knowing her, but I had met her boyfriend and his friends are part of my larger social group. The other night, I was at a party, and Taylor and her bf were there as well. We made eye contact and waved, but she pretty much avoided me all night. During the night, our mutual friends asked how I know Taylor, and I said we are half sisters. They all looked super uncomfortable and I pressed for an explanation. Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her. Were it not for the fact that it was obviously going to come out sooner or later that we are related, I probably wouldn't have bothered to set the record straight. As it was, I'm going to be around these people for a long time, and I didn't feel I should have had to walk around burdened by the weight of her lies. So I told the group the context.\n\nShe called me yesterday to yell at me. Apparently she's being ostracised from the group, her relationship is in trouble, her career opportunities are in jeopardy, etc. I don't see how any of this is my fault because she's the one who lied, but according to some people I should have been a bit more gentle in my retelling of the facts because it's her 'experience' and I've basically blackballed her.\n\nEDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t. That was pretty much the gist of it.\n\nEdit 2 (it was suggested I add this from the comments): I know the answer to these.\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t say to send her to boarding school. What my mom said was, Taylor is not living in this house with my daughter, if that means we split, then we split. My dad didn\u2019t want to be a full time parent by himself, so he stayed with my mom, and since he didn\u2019t have any other family Taylor could live with for various reasons, he sent her to boarding school.\n\nMy dad never cut contact with Taylor. He visited her at school (it was about an hour away) and sometimes he\u2019d see her at other relatives\u2019 places during school breaks. When he moved out, Taylor would occasional spend the day and maybe one break a year at his place.", "created_utc": 1686919745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aw0cn/aita_for_exposing_my_halfsisters_lies_about_our/", "score": 9576, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her account of being homeless because her step sister and step mother hated her and wouldn't allow her in their home was essentially the truth.

You didn't deserve to be bullied or terrorized in your own home, but she was YOUNG, clearly had awful parenting, and she needed more too. \n\nRealizing you didn't look great according to Taylor's account, I definitely think you handled it poorly. You moved to her city, joined up with her friend group, and when telling your side of the story en masse, you should have been more gentle and even perhaps more neutral - acknowledging you were BOTH CHILDREN when all this went down.

I cannot imagine the trauma that caused. On the other hand I can\u2019t imagine how hard it was for you dealing with someone like that.

Obviously not all kids are bullies, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she had the best childhood. To be sent away and be rejected by your family after the death of your mother has to do crazy damage on somebody.

You haven't taken into account what she was going through to act that way. From her perspective she was homeless because of her Dad's new family.

She acted horribly towards you but I imagine being shipped off to boarding school right after losing her mother was no walk in the park either. As far as consequences for bad behavior go, I'd say she probably had her fill. But what are you supposed to do? Be the evil stepsister forever? She couldn't seriously expect that.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible for other peoples lies.

NTA and shame on anyone else for suggesting otherwise. if you all want to assign blame to someone other than taylor, then assign it where it belongs: their father.", "I would almost agree with some of the E S H judgements here except for the fact that Taylor also lied and told her friends that OP was the reason that dad did not finance Taylor's business at age 20.

After that, she never bothered you again. \n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t said a single thing that isn\u2019t true about you, your mom and her dad. She had left you alone, has not engaged at all with you. Your now adult, and your response is to bully her, lie about her, and cause her to loose all her friends, her boyfriend and her job.

The family ends up needing outside help, or child services steps in and removes the child. It could have been a situation like that, but there\u2019s not enough details.\n\nEither way, Taylor got the shit end of the stick.

What she was doing and how she was behaving was probably something we wouldn't consider normal sibling bullying of course, but it is a normal child response to severe trauma. She should have been in therapy, and the household should have been heavily monitored and regulated to prevent any opportunity for her to bully you, to the best of your parents ability. \n\nI do not blame kids for acting like kids. These behaviours considering the circumstances and the ages are all typical and expected. I also would like to leave room for the fact that you don't know much about your dad's relationship with her mother and how that ended, even if you think you do. Parents keep secrets all the time, your mother and you may have been painted in a very bad light to her.\n\nAs you get older, you'll be able to see it from both sides, and hopefully be amicable.

The fact that everyone started backing away from her means that it tracks, that it is the Taylor they know. I don't see how getting a second side to the story on it's own does that.

Either sister is still a horrible bully and people heard OP's story and set \"yep, that tracks!\" or sister is being ridiculously dramatic claiming her life is in shambles when it is not, in fact, in shambles, and if it is, it has nothing to do with her half-sister undoing some lies at a party this one night.

The fact that those descriptors can be rightfully applied to Taylor doesn\u2019t stop the fact that she was a hateful child.\n\nOh, and her father abandoned her and made her homeless, her father chose to never really take her in. Her step mother and daughter didn\u2019t make her homeless. \n\nThis whole comment is super biased and leaves out nearly all the context given.\n\nEdited for spelling. As usual.

Then OP added an edit: \n\n>EDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t. That was pretty much the gist of it.\n\nSo, it still might all have felt true to Taylor. Maybe she thinks the only reason her dad wouldn't give her money is beacuse OP must have told him not too. And even though her Dad still didn't raise her after the divorce, it may be easier to tell herself it was all the steps influence. I'm sure when it first happened it really did feel that way, though it also just seems like Dad is a bit of deadbeat.\n\nI feel very badly for Taylor but I'd say NTA. The asshole though are both OP's mom and Taylor's Dad (Dad more, but absolutely both of them).

The truth was that she was kept out of the home because of a long pattern of extremely abusive behavior towards her sister.  That completely changes the situation because she goes from victim to offender.  That's also why she omitted that information (which is lying, it's called a lie by omission) because she knew that people would completely change how they view her, especially since she is completely unrepentant.", "Agreed. From Taylor\u2018s point of view, she told the truth - the fault lies with the adults that failed her, mostly her dad. \n\nDid Taylor paint herself in a more favorable light? Yes.

She was homeless because step mom and step sister hated her.  Yea she was a bully but damn.  She lost her mom, and then dad essentially told her he didn't want her.  That he wanted step mom and step sister more.  I'm surprised she isn't more fucked up as an adult.  That alone speaks volumes about her character.\n\nEdit:  Yes, step mom and step daughter had a reason to hate Taylor.  There is no denying that at all.

How was it said? Did she embellish it? We won't know because she glossed over her renditioning of her explanation.

You seem to admit here that she isn\u2019t wrong to feel the way she feels (the abandonment) I think if she hears you say that it\u2019d go a long way.

The sister sounds like she was and still is pretty awful, but without completely dismissing any agency she has to behave differently, she was very young and clearly troubled when these patterns were forged, which is a problem that falls on the parents. It is her fault, however, that she either doesn\u2019t see or chooses not to work on these issues. She\u2019s in the wrong, but she was definitely failed when it came to parenting.", "Exactly, her Mom did her job. The Father didn\u2019t do his, even when given the opportunity after the divorce.

If anything, maybe she needed a little discipline. Not to mention that her mother died when she was 11. The trauma this girl has gone through! My heart breaks for her.\n\nYeah, OP, YTA.", "*\"Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her\"*\n\nYTA. THIS is exactly what happened. Where is the lie? You yourself describe this. She lost her Mom at 11 and rather than helping and empathizing with a broken child who is obviously going through trauma; divorce then her Mom's death, you and your mom would rather shun her, act like spoiled brats and cast her out. You never grew up, she did. Now you are being the bully. She is speaking the truth, again, a truth that **you** described exactly.", "YTA\n\nShe WAS hated by her stepmother and half sister and shipped off to boarding school. My God. She was a kid. She needed her dad to take care of her, to get her psychiatric help. Instead she got shipped away.", "ESH\nWhat you initially told us before the edit about her 'lies' was actually very much the truth from her perspective. She was shipped off to boarding school because her stepmom and stepsister didn't want her around. She was ignored and abandoned. \n\nShe behaved terribly as a child and continues to do so as an adult twisting the truth. But that doesn't absolve you for casting her as a big bag villain. \n\nYou need to grow up and realize that your parents failed her. They didn't do right by her and she was obviously a troubled kid lashing out because her dad got a new family and her mom was a bad parent up till her mom's passing. \n\nYou two are adults. Y'all need to find a way to burry the hatchet and move on. Even if she has never apologized to you it might help if you try apologizing for the things you did wrong. Set the tone for the future.

I'd be pissed off too. Not just pissed, but traumatized, damaged.\n\nI understand your hatred for her because of her bullying, but good grief,  y'all were kids.

Nah, you definitely aren't telling the whole story.", "ESH \nYou and Taylor both did some serious spinning to make yourselves come out smelling like roses. Neither of you acted like angels.

I'm not saying that it makes the bullying acceptable but it may explain it.\n\nPlus, an 11-year old girl homeless, when her father is still alive, that isn't right either. He had a responsibility to raise her and he failed, simply because he didn't want to be a full time parent. He was so wrong!! It makes me angry tbh.\n\nYes, your mother made the right decision to split and have you with her full time, but Taylor should also have had the opportunity to move in with her Dad.\n\nYes, your half sister was very wrong telling those lies to her friends, but perhaps it was her reality from her experience as she saw it as an 11 year old child ... and nobody actually told her the truth of the situation?\n\nYou are not the AH for setting the recort straight among her friends, but I think you both are the victims of your Dad's inability to take responsibility.\n\nI would probably sit her down with your Dad to ask some question you and your sister may have.\n\nPerhaps you could both go to some counselling and you could gain a sister. \nFamily is the most important thing in life. \nThat is the advice I give to all my children and they are aged 18, 21 and 30.\n\nGood luck, this will be a long process but very much needed.", "The parents are the AH.

At what point as an adult, do you show some empathy and understanding, and shed your childhood. She WAS homeless because of you and your shitty dad. How did she lie? You moved to her city, befriended her friends, and then completely obliterated her, without even as much as having a conversation with her about your childhood, and see how you can move forward.

YTA because this story is fake.", "INFO\n\nI think you both would benefit from you talking to your mom about everything. Get clarification: was it mom's idea to send Taylor to boarding school? Did mom make dad cut contact with Taylor? If yes, then Taylor at least isn't lying about her step mom. But she is an AH for lying about you, when she simply assumed you had a hand in it. And seeing that she lied about some random thing when she was 20 makes me think she just is not inclined to tell the truth. Or at least she embellishes things. It makes me wonder, actually. If dad refused to give her money because he needed money for you and he told her that. In that way, you *were* the reason why she couldn't get money from dad, but it's not like you begged daddy to cut off your sister.", "YTA OP, and at this point a pretty massive one.

She didn't tell her story for you, she told her friends HER TRUTH so they could get to know her. \n\nYou are not children anymore OP.

Technically she was \"homeless\".  Boarding school is NOT a home, it is a school.  This CHILD lost the only blood relative who apparently cared about her, and was treated like an unwanted inconvenience by her remaining relatives, including her own FATHER.  (How absolutely generous of him to visit her at school occasionally).  This girl got denied the love of a family - of COURSE she lashed out!  You should really put yourself in her shoes and stop blaming a PARENTLESS, UNLOVED CHILD for being angry at being COMPLETELY ABANDONED.  As the mother of step children I am appalled that your mom didn't try to embrace this essentially orphaned young woman who had no mother of her own to guide her or attempt to embrace her.  And then you take a wrecking ball to the friends she obtained, probably feeling acceptance and empathy for the first time, convincing them that she has lied and that (once again!!!!) you are a golden boy whose word is more reputable?  Honestly you should be ashamed of yourself.  Very sad for her.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get what other people are saying. She told her side of the story, you provided yours.

She had no obligation to allow a rotten child like Taylor into her home to live. And it sounds like Taylor is a rotten adult now too. \n\nMy brother was like Taylor, except no one did a single thing to protect me from him. He never even got any form of punishment. I had to deal with being beat up, bullied, my things broken, my homework destroyed, for about 20 years.", "NTA I love how people just try and excuse he terrible behavior as a child.

You were a child being bullied (initially other comments you mention pulling hair and calling you names and etc). All of this for an eight-year old without siblings prior would have been scary. I'm not dismissing that she bullied you, and I'm not saying it was okay, but she was also a child. \n\nLike kids make other kids cry all the fucking time, it doesn't mean one of them is an evil person, at 8 years old - your emotional responses are still not really always appropriate. \n\nShe was a child probably lashing out in the only way she knew how, while the world collapsed and she lost her mother, then her home, and then got shipped off to boarding school. \n\nAs someone with siblings who was also bullied severally, children bullyeach other- its a fact of life. It sounds like she was extreme, so im sorry for you. That sucked but I wouldn't deny one child a family and a place to live because they were mean to another child at 11? Have you met an 11 year recently - at that age, they fucking love brutal honesty (like the John Mulaney bit) and push boundaries. \n That's crazy and vindictive. Her mother died/or was dying -  there will be difficult to manage emotions for the most emotionally stable adult, never-ending a fucking child.\n\nDid your mom just hate your dad's ex and couldn't bear to see her because that's the vibe I got from reading between the lines.\n\n\n\nPlus, because this is a one-sided story, I don't want to dismiss the idea that you're remembering a tale through tinted lenses (because you were eight and nobody's memory is perfect or maybe someone  has repeatedly told you this story adding bits of flair as you go on, because i reall doubt you reme specifics from that time cause you were so young). \n\nBut what she told her friends seems to be an accurate (if exaggerated) version of the same story. She (11) didn't get along with another child (8). Then her mother died, she had nowhere to go but her father's house, this was blocked because the other child's mother refused to let her live with her - because apparently an 11 year was so unmanageable. \n\nI think your mom didn't like this child or her mother, and that your shitty father didn't do the right thing - but you cannot seriously think you're the only victim here. \n\nThat's what happened, her mother died and then she was shipped off to boarding school and not permitted to come live with her only remaining family because your mom said no and your dad is spineless. \n\nFor you, a girl was mean to you/tormented you at the age of eight, so you got your mom to make sure she got sent off to boarding school and saw her a few times after this?", "ESH. This is an ongoing communication and problem- solving issue that started when your parents figured that boarding school was the only feasible option for Taylor, and continues to this day when you \"set her story straight.\" I get that a lot of her story could be exaggerated, but it definitely sounds (even just from your perspective) like she has been ostracized from her family by you and your mother (and later her father), and I don't doubt she's been homeless, even as a kid. All OP did was slam that final nail in the coffin, which is Taylor's ability to trust in family support.\n\nThings your folks could have done instead: trying to work with the kids about their behavior together and separately, while still having them spend some regular time together (especially after building a decent mutual relationship). Sending one kid off to boarding school and keeping the other at home, is not very cool.\n\nThings Taylor could have done differently: lying or not, she doesn't need to rely on a sad upbringing to gain a social footing. \n\nThings OP could do differently: check your privilege for one.  You word your post as if Taylor is THE problem, period, but what have YOU done to be the bigger person and not engage in the drama?

It's like something out of Oliver Twist. I'm heartbroken for that girl. She was failed by her biological parents at every turn.\n\nOP and her mother, however, had no say in that.

Lets NOT dismiss that this could very well be a side of the truth that we are not presented with.   \nHATE ME ALL YOU WANT, BUT frankly speaking the other thing is that we dont know the true facts and extent of the proclaimed bullying that OP had to endure on weekends when Taylor was over. From this post it feels like nobody in Taylor's life was ever on her side at her youth, maybe it was the lack of love received that caused her to act out and \"bully\" OP. Her father wasnt there to support or lend a listening ear to Taylor.   \nI do not blame Taylor for being a bully for a few years of her YOUTH, but the parents who created the atmosphere for such and didnt help her perhaps seek therapy.   \nAlot happened in Taylor's life during her youth and he is 100% valid for stating that she was abandoned.

So you can\u2019t pin this on trauma that happened after the fact\n\nY\u2019all have so much to to say about her sisters trauma, but a startling lack of regard about that the trauma that OP an even younger child undoubtably sustained from being mercilessly abused in her own home", "For sure I understand this. I think that\u2019s probably what happened. I went to therapy and believe me I made up every reason under the sun why my dad was the way he was so that it wouldn\u2019t be his fault, because who wants to believe you have a parent like that?

Had your dad been a parent and stepped up and took care of everything, this would not have been how it ended. She lost her mother at 11 years old. She essentially had no family and no one willing to take her in on top of losing the only parent that was in her life consistently. And on top of that whatever mental health issues she was having before that. So she was homeless basically and she had no family. The only person you should truly be pissed. That really is your father. Who failed her and you on a monumental level. I\u2019m going with NTA for sticking up for yourself, but you really need to get into therapy and so does your sister.

Then she never had a loving home again, bounced around between relatives like a burden they can all tolerate just enough to have her around for a break.\n\nIn terms of her being awful to you, you guys were small children. kids that age act out in response to things like, for example, your father leaving your family to live with, love and be present for another family instead of you. I would assume you were the target of her frustrations that came from that. \n\nShe did leave out the part about how she treated you horribly when you were young, but the rest of what she said is pretty close to the truth.

My husband and I both have PTSD from childhood things and we just started figuring it out and unraveling those patterns that don\u2019t serve us recently, and we are in our mid thirties. \n\nAt 24 Taylor is just finally about a fully formed adult.

AND to correct when they see lies in this information could harm them.\n\nSister-in-law shared her experience from her perspective. OP is not responsible for the actions of the adults in this shitty situation. Either as a child nor is an adult. \n\nTo me it looks like the sister-in-law has a lot of unresolved issues and trauma from her childhood, and has woven a story that needs darkness and isolation to continue to thrive. All the OP has done is shared her experience of the situation. The fact that this enraged the sister-in-law so much shows to me that she\u2019s laying a lot of blame on another child who at the time and today is not responsible for that. \n\nIt\u2019s really sad, and it really sucks. But the way to the sister-in-law has chosen to share information that is not accurate and has resulted in others feeling her less than trustworthy is a natural outcome of lying.", "I am very perplexed by reaction. If a friend had told me her stepmother and sister had barred her from her father's house at age 11, and I basically had no home from age 14 after her mother died, and then I met the sister who basically confirmed the story, but added context (the bullying), I wouldn't  take the sister's word for everything. Maybe I would think the situation was more complex than my friend had said, but OP did not, in fact, expose any lies, certainly nothing that would make Taylor's boyfriend, friends and boss (!) immediately ostracize her. I find this very hard to believe.", "I agree on many points, but Taylor's friends/BF were awfully quick to ditch her.  That makes me think most of that was due to Taylor's behavior towards them, and is not OP's fault.  It's not OP's fault that Taylor is lying today (some of her story was true, but a lot of it wasn't), and she's the sort of person who yells at someone when things don't go her way.

I\u2019d group text your friends and elaborate on the situation or even just share this thread with them to spare your sister being ostracized as that\u2019s not fair to her. \n\n16 years is an very unhealthy amount of time to hold a grudge.

It's hard to imagine that Taylor did anything sufficiently terrible (based on OP's account, at least) to justify her being abandoned by her father.\n\nOP's dad did real, irrevocable harm to Taylor by sending her to boarding school, and she has every right to be hurt by that. OP interfering with Taylor's current social situation just seems needlessly cruel.", "My thoughts exactly. On top of this it seems like Taylor is reliving the same trauma of essentially not belonging after her friend group excluded her,  based on your retelling of the story. Taylor needs new and better friends.", "Yes. I don't think you can hold either person responsible for what they did as children (the parents are another issue altogether) and the OP had a right to try to set the record straight, but as an adult they needed to say something non-commital to people in the moment like \"oh, I hadn't heard it described like that before. We were both kids but it was a lot more complicated. We can talk about it some other time\" and then have a conversation with Taylor about this one on one and in private.\n\nIt's easier for a kid to blame some external force rather than her one surviving parent for her feelings of abandonment and she may or may not have had the chance to confront or work through that as an adult. It's also extremely likely that her father and his family lied to to or misled her as a means of trying to shift blame off of themselves. He sounds like a real piece of work and her behaviour as a child and adult are certainly the product of that.\n\nIt is likely that neither Taylor nor the OP actually understand how the other person experienced the relationship that they had and both could have benefitted from talking about it as adults.", "Well, I mean OP sister did lie to her friends in the way that made OP and her mother seem like evil people. Taylor has a right to feel resentful. She does not have a right to slander OP especially considering she is her victim. Nor does she have a right to slander OP\u2019s mother from protecting her child. We can validate her feelings without excusing her asshole behavior.", "The conflict central to the story is whether OP was an asshole for not lying. She's not and Taylor is an asshole for expecting OP to accept a lie and a tarnish on her reputation in order to prop up Taylor's lie.\n\nI agree with your assessment of the historic situation though", "Lies of omission are just as heinous as lies themselves, and are signs of deeper red flags. The half-sister has grown into a manipulator and loves to play the victim.", "She lied about why she couldn\u2019t move in with OP. She lied about why she was hated. She lied about tons of shit.", "I do too. The dad is the one who really screwed up.", "What did OP do wrong exactly? She's not blaming Taylor for their parents' poor decisions. She's literally just saying what happened", ">You didn\u2019t need to elaborate\n\nAt this point she did. Taylor essential told a Cinderella story where OP was the evil sister. This is the version of OP that ppl know in that town. She has every right to tell the truth or to save her own reputation. If she hadn\u2019t, she would have lived in this town with the whispers of how mean and abusive she was following her, when in reality she was a victim. Just like this is affecting Taylor\u2019s social and work life, it also has the potential to affect OP\u2019s social and work life. The only difference is that Taylor actually did those things.", "If the father was single you're deluding yourself in thinking he would have raised her. He moved out when she was 17 and STILL didn't even want her to move in when the job of raising was basically done.", "I don\u2019t know why they split. My dad dated a lot of people, Idek how long they dated, they had split before Taylor was born. I think my dad started seeing my mom when Taylor was about 6 months old.", "Idk about you but if I found out someone had been lying to me for years for sympathy and if I found out they were that bad of a bully in the past and lied about it I would be upset too. Friendship is built on trust not lies and half truths.", "I think that that's the point, that if literally everything else was okay with Taylor's social group, then OP telling her side of the story involving Taylor SHOULDN'T be affecting anything.\n\nWhich means the fact that it is affecting things implies that things *weren't* completely fine before OP said her side.", "Not to mention their stories are not THAT dissimilar.", ">Yeah, I don\u2019t see enough people addressing this particular elephant in the room.\n\nIt's not quite the same, but my best friend had a bad break up with his (ex-)fiancee in college. He graduated a year before she did and moved out of town. She started spreading all kinds of lies to their old mutual friends as well as her friends who didn't know him, and a batch of freshmen who joined the society they'd both been part of. She completely trashed his reputation and played the victim, even going as far as making up a restraining order she had supposedly taken out against him, saying that's why he had to move out of town. He showed up to *one* end of term social event and sat calmly talking to a few of those people, hardly even mentioning her at all. But the fact that he was there and that nobody called the police on him spread like wildfire, and everyone realized she had been lying her ass off, not just about the restraining order but about everything else too. The ex lost the majority of her friends in one weekend. Sometimes all it takes is one lie being exposed and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.", "Yeah that's just shitty parenting. No actual trying, just sending her away somewhere else or yelling at her. No wonder she's got some issues.", "Ik I feel insane reading these replies, Taylor needed therapy and A SANE PARENT not banishment????", "[removed]", "This is not the issue. We can talk about what other people who are no longer alive to defend themselves should have done 10 years ago but that really doesn't help either OP or Taylor today. Taylor slandered OP. OP had a right to defend their reputation. It sounds like they both went through difficult times with parents who either fueled the problem or just didn't know how to handle it, but that doesn't give someone the right to slander another.", "Yeah, I don't understand how subOP get upvoted so much. IF OP is telling us the truth, the real asshole is Taylor and then possibly her father. I wouldn't call mother/OP asshole at all. Also the argument about going same city and same group friend? I think subOP doesn't understand how small commuties work and just want to put his judgement over people in the internet and then get back eating chips on his couch.", "I have a question. I have a father figure that is not the greatest and a sibling relationship with my sister no dissimilar to what you describe.\n\nWhat I later learned is that the inaccuracies my sister told were at least partially due to lies my father told her to cover his own ass. Is it in any way possible that there was something similar going on here?\n\nIt's at least possible that from her perspective that what she said to her friends was true even if it conflicts from your truthful perspective.", "But you have to wonder what he told her. These kinds of people don't want to accept that responsibility. She probably wasn't told, \"you're going to boarding school because you're too difficult for me to parent,\" she was probably told, \"sorry kiddo, if it were up to me you would live with me.

Your Mom was right. She really didn't have any other choice. None of this is on you or your Mom. Or even Taylor, who was just a kid at the time. I feel so sad for all of you. I hope you all find healing and good lives. You have a right to tell your truth.", "My guess is Taylor saw you and your mom as the reason her parents couldn\u2019t be together. That doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior, but I think it partially explains it.", ">Not all kids who were bullies change a new leaf some stay bullies\n\nI would argue that very very few change. They just find acceptable outlets for their bullying.

It's possible that they were just waiting for a reason that seemed good enough to oust her, so they jumped on the chance when they got a story on lying about family.\n\nGranted, it's not hard from reading the post why step-sis might have felt that way. She was obviously struggling with a dysfunctional family, and being shipped off to boarding school because the step family doesn't like you is the plot of most C tier family movies. And that's without remembering her mom *died*. But I don't doubt that it wouldn't be as big a deal had she emphasized her bio family's failure (even without disclosing her bullying) instead of blaming the step-family for everything.\n\nShe wanted to be the Cinderella but only qualified for the evil step-sister.\n\n(I know OP is the half-sister but her mom is also tied in)", "Well I mean, the boarding school is her fault.

BTW, I think OP\u2019s father is also a HUGE AH for not finding another solution (I.e. he\u2019s lives with his older daughter alone for X amount of time while both girls get therapy and they all attend family counseling to heal). \n\nAdults have behaved very poorly after losing a loved one from the grief/trauma, I don\u2019t understand why some compassion wasn\u2019t extended to a CHILD with certain stipulations to not continue to traumatize another child. OP also doesn\u2019t state *HOW* her half-sister\u2019s mother passed; but I\u2019m assuming it was sudden, and I\u2019m not sure if substance abuse, SI, DV, or an accident was involved, but depending on the how, that could also have deeply impacted her behavior and long-lasting sense of abandonment.", "I understand the Mom wanting to protect her child, but she knew he had a child from the previous relationship.\nYou had the privilege and support from your family while she was shipped off, alone.\n\nMy middle sister and I were discarded as teenagers.

She was only 6 when I left the house. \n\nWhat's interesting is that my middle sister and I turned to drugs and wasted years of our lives. My youngest sisters life has always been put together because she had support and guidance.\n\n Not only did your half sisters Mother die, she was left to grieve in a boarding school.\n\nFriends are all your half sister had due to family running their backs on her. I can relate to that, I have friends that I love more than family.\n\nYou both were children, why did you feel the need to defend yourself when you said you did nothing wrong.\n\nIt appears that you lack empathy. You will never know what it was like to be in her predicament because you both had different experiences growing up. That was her story to tell, not yours.\n\nThe only thing your half sister was guilty of was what you stated above. You both were children and she was judged way too harshly.

She has a deep-seated resentment of her half-sister... probably because her dad said \"sorry, can't do anything because your half-sister is pitching a fit.\" So I throw some of the blame for that on the dad too.  That said, if someone were to reframe / challenge her ideas as an adult and she still held steadfast rather than admitting that it logically makes sense to blame the adults (even if it takes her a while to get over her emotions)... then that's totally on her.\n\nDon't underestimate the power of ideas that you've assimilated but never questioned.

Was Taylor ever punished or told \"you need to stop this abuse or you can't come over\", did they try therapy? If a sincere effort was made to stop the behavior and Taylor refused so they can obviously expect that she likely won't stop even with help and it will likely get worse, then yes as cruel as it sounds I do think mom is justified.\n\nHowever, if no attempt was made or was blocked by taylor's mom and the didn't want to try after they had ability to do that with her mom's passing then yes there is a huge problem there. At the very least when the topic of her moving in come up did the dad go to her and explain \"the abuse you are inflicting is so bad that we can't allow you near your sister if you're going to treat her like that, you don't have to be perfect as obviously, you're going through a lot, but the abuse and bullying has to stop right now or we can't have you in the house\" if they didn't give her a chance to change then yes, that demand isn't fair.\n\nAnd she didn't really say \"choose me and her over your other daughter\" She simply stated the facts; she and op can't live with taylor, so if she's here they're going to leave.\n\nAs for telling friends the truth, well if Taylor is going to tell out right lies that she was homeless and OP ruined her business then op has the right to defend herself and tell them the truth. That Taylor's bullying was so bad they couldn't let her near her. And I don't think op is the type to embellish what happened it's likely she just told them the facts.\n\nAnd they don't need to be reminded that they were kids, they would have known their ages from the story and would have the common sense to take that into account.\n\nThis family abandoned a girl, who lost her mom, to boarding school. That's horrible! These people would have had the same reaction people are having here. \"Ok she lied, but clearly she went through a lot and how could you ship off a kid to boarding school over some bullying\"\n\nSo how bad was this bullying that these adults didn't want to hang around her anymore?\n\nHOWEVER, the dad is the clear asshole. His actions are inexcusable, as op said he didn't ship her off to boarding school to protect his daughter. HE DID IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A SINGLE PARENT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HARD. HE WAS TOO LAZY TO BE A DAD. his daughter his responsibility even if she is a goddamn monster. He is the one that has no good reason not to support or be there with her. He should have worked with her he should have tried to make her well enough that she should could come back. If boarding was the only option then visiting her on weekends is not enough, he should have been there as much as possible, he should have taken her to and neutral ground place to make sure she was supported.\n\nEDIT: I recognize that a boarding school is not a proper home but it sounds like Taylor was painting an image of her out on the streets begging for change to get a meal which isn't true as she was provided for financially", "She's not making shit up really though, just telling it how an 11 year old experienced it.

The fact the friend group never even knew they were related is proof enough imo.\n\nJust an asterisk here, but as the father was the only point of communication, we have no idea what the father actually said to her regarding any of those things.

Taylor was also very young at the time, and all *she* knew was that she got essentially kicked out because her half sister threw a tantrum.

Her dead mother hated them and so would Taylor, is a very plausible scenario for me.\n\nI'm really not sure what people expect here. Anything below ideal should never be the bar set for assholes.", ">Her anger is justified.\n\nI disagree with this part. The reason that she was unable to stay with OP was because she bullied OP to the point where she would freak out at a mention of her coming over. And keep in mind, this was *before* her mother died.\n\nI mean, no one wants to put their kid in the same house with a child who likes to bully them. OP's dad fucked up by sending her off, but OP and her mother are blameless here. You've got to put your own child first; no one else will.", "He didn\u2019t abandon her for his new family. He didn\u2019t want to do the work of raising a child and didn\u2019t have anyone else to dump her on.

OP owed her no charity when correcting the record. The adult Taylor could have appealed to honor or integrity if she hadn't been embellishing. But basically, None of this is on OP.", "Yep exactly!  At some point you have to take responsibility for your actions, even if the trauma that precipitated you making those actions wasn't your fault.  Taylor is an adult and part of being an adult is self-ownership.", "This is a very uncharitable comment and also very very ignorant of childhood development. Nobody is born a \u201cmanipulative asshole\u201d and Taylor\u2019s poor behaviour as a child is entirely her parents\u2019 fault. She deserved to have better parents who cared for her, like OP had her mom caring for her. I really don\u2019t understand how (presumably) grown adults are on here saying disgusting things about a child who suffered an unpleasant divorce, bad parenting through that divorce, and losing her mom at age 11 and subsequent abandonment from her father. It isn\u2019t the least bit surprising or unusual that Taylor was behaving badly when it\u2019s evident she had very little support and good parenting! It\u2019s awful to claim she\u2019s some biologically defected being who deserved the mistreatment from her own parents.", "Wow, you sound just like my abusive mother.", "I hear you.  I know the type.  I don\u2019t really see your sister as much of an asshole, but you had to tell your side.  it would affect your relationships if you didn\u2019t. Nta (asshole being your dad.)", "The one uniting agreement so far has been... yeah, OP's father sucked.", "To be fair to OP it sounds like she was willing to let the past lie and recognizes Taylor's situation growing up was bad, the only reason she shared details of their relationship was because Taylor was slandering OP.", "Even if she didn't before hand, now she has trauma and abandonment issues that will scar her for life. He failed as a father. OP's mom isn't blameless by any stretch of the imagination, but dad deserves the biggest portion of the blame.\n\nEdit: I had originally said that OP and her mom weren't blameless, but yeah, OP doesn't deserve any real blame. She is a victim. But I stand by my opinion that Taylor didn't deserve the hand she was dealt.", "Where am I blaming the mother for his choices? And I'm a woman who is a feminist and a leftist lol.....I don't think I've ever been called sexist. **I'm saying the stepmom isn't completely blameless in this mess** ***as the original comment says 'it's all on him.'*** \n\nI'm saying he was far worse, but she's an asshole for even giving that choice in the first place. She could have divorced him, she could have told him 'we are separating temporarily while you get your daughter intensive therapy,' etc. Instead, she told him to kick out an eleven year old. There's a very good chance they have money....boarding school is generally for the VERY rich in the US unless the kid is sent off to military school. Instead, OP's mom was fine staying married for six years to a man who abandoned his child.", ">Every week her mom would end up in the kitchen screaming at my parents.\n\nDoesn't seem like T.'s mom was all that great either. The apple didn't fall far from the tree. She may have been a angel to HER mother, but Mom didn't mind her disrupting ex husband's household. I wouldn't be surprised if mother cooked up ideas and encouraged it.", "You don't know HOW OP's mom treated her. We do know that OP's mom was trying to protect her own kid. And dad wasn't the best of dads to Taylor. He should've made one day of quality time with her alone and the other with his/OP's family. Many guys are lazy  to do any parenting at all.", "And it sounds like OP's dad didn't really do much to help guide his older daughter to not treat OP poorly. Honestly, OP's wife should have left sooner and took OP with her and force the dad to step it up.", "She didn\u2019t even just bully OP- she harassed her pets, broke things, and was a bully before her mom even passed.", ">You've got to put your own child first; no one else will.\n\nAlright, OP's mom was looking out for her own daughter. Fine. But who was looking out for Taylor? Oh, that's right, NOBODY.", "I'm not saying that's the case. I'm saying that that's likely how it looked to Taylor. Nobody is blameless. Parents hold more blame than the kids though.", "Nobody Sees themself as a Bully.", "I sympathize with OP as much as the sibling. They both have a spineless father.", "From what we've heard of dad in this story I wouldn't be surprised if that slander was what he told Taylor, not something Taylor came up with on her own. This guy couldn't be bothered taking responsibility for his own child, I highly doubt he's keen on owning the responsibility for his own choices either, especially when an easy scapegoat exists.", "OP and her mom are blameless. An 8 year old not wanting to live with her bully and a mom protecting her child aren\u2019t to blame.", "OP is blameless because she was a child who deserved to have a safe home where she wasn't being tormented and has no obligation to allow her half sister to spread lies smearing her character now. Op's mom fell down on the job because she should have just left the dad when he made it clear he would abandon one of his children to keep his wife and then it would have been very clear who was responsible for Taylor being virtually abandoned. OPs dad is ultimately the one to blame as the adult who had an obligation to her and Taylor seems to have opted not to recognize that.\n\nIt sounds like she hasn't reached a point where she is able to recognize her relationship with OP was a direct result of her actions. Regardless of what trauma she experienced as a child it does not negate the fact that she traumatized OP and is not OP's victim as she has painted herself.", "Oof I forgot about the screaming. Yeah Mom should\u2019ve been setting a better example for sure.", "I don't disagree. I definitely blame all the adults in this situation. I think it's safe to say if Taylor experienced any semblance of love in that household, it would have gone a long way for OP and Taylor.", "OP didn\u2019t abandoned anyone she was a child. The father and only the father was to blame. That was his child. He should have gotten a place and moved on with his child and get her therapy. It is not okay to be a bully and OP stated she terrorized her animals. As a adult you can and should try to see the person for who they are now and now the adult is spreading lies about OP moving in with dad so she couldn\u2019t (false) and after not helping with her business because of OP (again false). Only thing OP should have been sensitive about was her half sister\u2019s feelings of being abandoned as a child because that was her feelings and no one else can justify her feelings.", "It\u2019s very easy to dismiss the person who most easily fits the villain narrative. It\u2019s not easy to look at the broader situation with compassion and understanding that kids are almost always a product of their environment and adults make mistakes way more than they are willing to admit.", "I would agree. The book \"Inside the Criminal Mind\" by Stanton Samenow essentially argues that there are people who are born bad, it's a really good read (at least for people interested in criminal psychology lol) and has examples of what you described.", "That's fair, OP isn't really at fault. And I agree, I think the biggest AH is their dad. He dropped the ball completely. But I feel for Taylor. Right after her mother died, her father essentially abandoned her and refused to let her into his home. And I think the fact that she was young and already exhibiting bad behaviors and mental health struggles compounded and led her to lay the blame unfairly on OP's shoulders. But it leaves a sour taste in my mouth to say she deserved it. Nobody deserves to go through that.", "My guess is that OP's mother is the cause. This \"bullying\" sounds like a child acting out when treated poorly and taking it out on the child that was treated well. The only time in this story that we hear about her treating OP poorly is when she had to stay with them. \n\nIt's not her parents missing that changed because her father still frequently saw her. It was her stepmother no longer being around. \n\nUp thread, it was mentioned that her mother was always screaming. Why was she doing that? It's never mentioned but imagine being a parent and finding out that the people who were supposed to be taking care of your child were mistreating her. How would you react?", "I don't see where she lied. It is basicly the truth.", "Here's the thing, what you did wasn't \"exposing lies\" it was \"providing context\". She was being truthful when saying she didn't have a home, because she didn't, you literally outline why. \n\nYou're not wrong for telling them more about what happened, but you also insinuated that she lied when she really didn't. That's where I find the fault. ESH", "YTAH. She was 11, and you were 8. Even if she was a bully to you, it was not okay for your parents to essentially throw her away. Especially after her mother died. Let's take this kid who is already struggling and abandon her. You were eight, and she was taught that you mattered 100% more. You said when she was older that there was no bullying that she just was not pleasant, but would you be? Your mother got her kicked out of her home for you. Then she moves away, starts new, and you fallow her and taint her reputation that she built because you didn't like the light you were painted in? GROW UP this all happened 16 years ago.  How long is she going to have to play for being a meanie to you?  You are giving golden child energy, let her live her dang life. She moved away and made a life for herself and you copied her and are now trying to mess it up for her and continue to play the victim. Again it's been 16 years people get less time for murder.", "Taylor is not slandering you. You were born at her expense, it\u2019s just a fact. \n\nNone of this is her fault. Your whining and complaining made her homeless because your parents were inadequate, but that\u2019s not your fault either. Your parents should have handled it properly. Kids don\u2019t always get along. Proper supervision prevents everything you\u2019ve described. Something is deeply wrong and selfish about your mother and probably you as a product of that, and what you\u2019ve done is a continuation of that disgusting pattern. Go to therapy and leave her alone.", "For the homelessness, it's not really a lie. Try to put yourself in her shoes, as a kid, that's exactly how it feels like. Also, imagine the shame she feels that her dad picked you instead of her and basically abandoned her. \n\nFor the rest, have you ever thought about asking Taylor if maybe those were things your dad told her ? You know, to put the responsibility of his terrible choices on you (after your parents split, the business thing) instead of owning up to it. It wouldn't surprise me, your dad is an asshole. \n\nI still think that you're NTA. However, if you don't understand why your half-sister was resentful (still is) and acting out, you need to mature a bit more.", "YTA. everything she said about you is true according to your own narrative. You're saying she was a bully... Why she was under 10 years old. A small child being an ass isn't the same as bullying. What you in fact appear to have orchestrated in the following years was bullying though because you held all the power.", "INFO:  do you realize your dad is basically a failure as a parent?", "NTA but damn, this is a mess all around. Your dad is the cause of all this fuckery. I don't understand how he got two women to have kids with him.", "ESH, but your dad is the biggest one / the reason this happened.", "ESH.\n\nShe was 11. What do you think she told herself? She obviously had other issues going on that her 11 year old mind didn't understand and it's likely no one talked to her.\n\nHonestly, your dad was a dick and your mom also. I'm sorry- but bullying is a \"sign\". Healthy kids don't bully. That was a sign she needed help. I'm sure sending her away worsened everything for her. She lost everything she thought she had and then the ones she did have sent her away.\n\nDude, self reflect. Then- fucking reach out to your sister and tell her you want to talk and have a relationship and understand what happened to you BOTH as kids.  You had one perspective, she had another. She had NO ONE. Sit and think through your life, but from her perspective- that everything that happened to her happened to you instead.\n\nMaybe her mom sucked and made her feel terrible, or visiting you made her feel inferior. Kids who are mistreated and hurt are bullies.\n\nYour father chose you over her. What the hell do you think she thinks? That is NOT your fault, but it's up to you to heal it. That's your sister. Give her something she never had- understanding. Talk to her. Tell her you are sorry that you held this belief so long, that you held it because she was not good to you as kids, and that you recognize A,B,C,D- whatever you come to realize from this post. Tell her you are sorry that she was let down by the adults in her life, that you believed that narrative, and if she wants you are open to her. She might still suck! But, damn, give her a chance. Imagine your life as hers. Your only present parent dies and you get sent to boarding school because no one loves you enough to give you a chance to heal and be taught. Difficult children absent of insane psychological issues need attention, not abandonment.\n\nThis is YOUR CHANCE. Be that for her. Just talk. You are people. Walk through her life in your mind- as you even. I bet you'll feel sad- and if she was already nasty to you, she was being treated poorly BEFORE it her mom died. Sounds like she's only ever had pain. Empathy. Empathy. Empathy.\n\nAnd, newsflash, your parents hurt YOU by doing this, too. I say this as someone who found out they have a different father and a sister and brother at age 37, as a former only child. Make sure both of you are blaming the right people.", "Both of you are AHs. You have a good life, you didn't need to bomb hers. People can grow up in the same environment and have completely different experiences. Her lived experience has you and your mom as villains, and your lived experience has her as a villain. Both of you had lousy parents who clearly didn't help you get therapy so instead of blaming the shitty parents, you are both blaming each other, people who were literal children at the time all this was happening, for what went down. It wasn't your fault and it wasn't her fault. You seem to be able to see that YOU were a kid when this went down and had no control over what went on, but you can't see that SHE was also a child with limited control over anything as well. You've both painted the wrong person as the bad guy, it ain't each other, its your parents.", "ESH but the only person I feel bad for is Taylor. and I really want to know what kind of whack job friends are ostracizing her over shit she did a kid. This post reads as fake bully revenge fantasy to me. I would be socially crucified if I was held to that standard for how I acted when I was 8-11. It sounds like Taylor finally found a space of supportive people, ykno after her mom dying and dad abandoning her and being bounced around, and from the tone in this post it feels like you took a lot of joy in breaking that. whoever is not talking to her bc of stuff she did as a *child* should not have adult friends.

Wow. Every bit of what she said was truthful to her, by your own account.   She was a child, who lost her mom & was shipped off because her step mommy & daddy couldn't step up and parent?!? You think an occasional visit at school or on break is good enough?? She had no one to help her through her grief. She was shipped between relatives because dad couldn't man up. Now you are going to nit pick the facts??", "I feel sorry for Taylor. She had a shitty childhood with an absent father and an obviously resentful mother who she looses later while watching op have a more normal childhood with HER father.

I tend to side with you half sister here just filling in the blanks of her abandonment trauma and your clear entitlement issues.\n\nIt sounds like your half sister told the truth of the situation, I don\u2019t see the lie here. She was basically homeless, spent holidays on strangers\u2019 couches and was shipped off to boarding school  while you had a family since your father didn\u2019t want to raise her and was too busy appeasing his new family that he built away from your half sister.\n\nShe lost her mom at a young age and her dad abandoned her while your parents continually choose you over her. She had NO other family.\n\nNow you\u2019re an adult and you could have chosen to let that go or perhaps even confronted her directly to tell her your feelings about all of this and perhaps dealt with these feelings in a more healthy way but you chose to gossip and try to destroy the good things she had going for herself. I bet she finally felt that life was coming together for her, only to have you come in to destroy it all. Is this your idea of karma?", "ESH - Except Taylor. All the adults in her life failed her.  My guess is she never had the therapy you benefitted from. She was most likely lied to and manipulated by a broken mother and tossed aside by her father. \n\nShe was homeless - boarding school is a place with administrators and teachers paid to be their guardian ad litem until the students go home to the love of their parents.

It seems like the dad just didn't want to deal with this problem and focused on the new family. He should have gotten Taylor help and the support she needed. Instead he shipped her off to boarding school. How could that not send the message of 'you aren't wanted' and 'this is not your home'? I think your friends were right when they said this was a matter of a perspective. You two have different perspectives, which is different from 'lying'. Do you hate her? I think showing her a little love here would go a long way. I don't see why the friend group has to dissolve over this drama. I think honestly it's in both your best interests to work things out. Bury this hatchet and heal.", "ESH. Kids fight and argue, most grow out of it.

That falls squarely on your dad's shoulders. Your mom was doing what was best for her child.", "Gads! What a terrible situation. \n\nOn one hand, you have an angry tween bouncing between two homes. One home is where she sees her dad with his replacement family. Then this poor kid loses a parent. Imagine being that kid where your mom dies and no one, not even your father, wants you. So instead of therapy and a solid plan for reunification, the dad ships the 11 year old off to boarding school\u2026 at 11\u2026 grieving for not only the loss of her mother, but the rejection of her father. This confirms to her that he replaced her with his new family. I\u2019d be traumatized by this. \n\nOn the other hand, you have a child who is being tormented by the 11 year old. The 11 year old is likely acting out - this is not uncommon but needs to be addressed. It sounds like the parents did nothing to mitigate the disaster of putting an angry displaced child with the target of her displacement. It was never going to be easy but it\u2019s as though your parents didn\u2019t even try that hard. Again, therapy could have helped. \n\nYour parents failed you both. But she was the one who was abandoned, at 11, after her mother died. That\u2019s pretty harsh. Her truth, her perception of her childhood, is not exactly wrong. \n\nYour father is the true AH here because he\u2019s allowed you to be her scapegoat. He obviously did not want to be her parent. It\u2019s much safer to be angry at an estranged half sibling than the only parent you have left. \n\nYou were not wrong to tell your experiences, but have a little compassion. You and your mom did \u201chate her\u201d. She did get sent to boarding school because you and your mom didn\u2019t want her. Her dad didn\u2019t want her back even after he divorced your mom.

Instead of acting like a father to BOTH of his children and taking the family to counseling to help fix this, he elected to ship his other daughter off and act like she didn\u2019t exist.  \n\nThen, years later when she\u2019s explaining how she grew up from her perspective (you know your perspective isn\u2019t the only one, right?) you take that away from her too (on top of stability and a family) by making your fathers missteps HER fault. \n\nYou and your parents all suck.", "ESH\nThe whole being homeless because of half sister and stepmum is factually correct.
