She bullied me really badly any time I saw her, to the point that I would scream every time my dad even mentioned her coming over. Even if we were kept apart, she would break my things, upset my pets, and tell lies about me. Every week her mom would end up in the kitchen screaming at my parents.\n\nTaylor's mom died when she was 11. Her mom didn't have any family able to take her in, and nor did my dad. My dad was the only one who could get custody.\nWhen I was told about this, I freaked out. Screaming, crying for hours, calling my grandparents and demanding to live with them, all of it. My mom wasn't willing to have Taylor in the house on that basis, and I'm pretty sure she said she would move out if my dad pushed the issue. Taylor ended up being sent to boarding school the next year, and she would go to stay with other members of my dad's family during breaks. When I was 14 my parents divorced, and I would see Taylor every few months at my dad's during school breaks. I'd learnt to stand up for myself and she'd grown up so there was no bullying, but we'd bicker - she was hostile and I never backed down. I didn't see her much after she went to college, and then I went to college far away as well.\n\nWe now live in the same small city (I moved here in March). It's the kind of place where everyone from each generation knows or knows of each other. I had never encountered Taylor socially and never mentioned knowing her, but I had met her boyfriend and his friends are part of my larger social group. The other night, I was at a party, and Taylor and her bf were there as well. We made eye contact and waved, but she pretty much avoided me all night. During the night, our mutual friends asked how I know Taylor, and I said we are half sisters. They all looked super uncomfortable and I pressed for an explanation. Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her. Were it not for the fact that it was obviously going to come out sooner or later that we are related, I probably wouldn't have bothered to set the record straight. As it was, I'm going to be around these people for a long time, and I didn't feel I should have had to walk around burdened by the weight of her lies. So I told the group the context.\n\nShe called me yesterday to yell at me. Apparently she's being ostracised from the group, her relationship is in trouble, her career opportunities are in jeopardy, etc. I don't see how any of this is my fault because she's the one who lied, but according to some people I should have been a bit more gentle in my retelling of the facts because it's her 'experience' and I've basically blackballed her.\n\nEDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t.

Her account of being homeless because her step sister and step mother hated her and wouldn't allow her in their home was essentially the truth. The adults in that situation should have done much, much  more to create a better situation for you both. You didn't deserve to be bullied or terrorized in your own home, but she was YOUNG, clearly had awful parenting, and she needed more too. \n\nRealizing you didn't look great according to Taylor's account, I definitely think you handled it poorly. You moved to her city, joined up with her friend group, and when telling your side of the story en masse, you should have been more gentle and even perhaps more neutral - acknowledging you were BOTH CHILDREN when all this went down.

She acted horribly towards you but I imagine being shipped off to boarding school right after losing her mother was no walk in the park either. As far as consequences for bad behavior go, I'd say she probably had her fill. But what are you supposed to do? Be the evil stepsister forever?

OP\u2019s reaction to Taylor\u2019s name while 8 years old and under wasn\u2019t something she was doing maliciously, it was the result of Taylor\u2019s choices. OP\u2019s actions at 8 years old didn\u2019t make Taylor homeless, Taylor\u2019s choices to bully OP led to her being sent to boarding school to protect OP.", "They know. I\u2019ve spoken about him before, and he\u2019s in town often and is known in the area. Everyone knows he\u2019s a\u2026certain type of person.", ">Not homeless in boarding school.\n\nHomeless doesn't mean you are living on the streets, it means you don't have a consistent place to live and would jump between relatives (\"she would go to stay with other members of my dad's family during breaks\")", "Definitely agree", "I don't know if she actively terrorized the older sister but she's definitely attempting to paint herself as being 100% innocent in this situation and that seems unlikely.\n\nEspecially since the story that her sister was telling *was* true and OP doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that.", "I am not saying you are wrong for adjusting the narrative because she did throw you under the bus as well, but her general sentiment is also true. The real AH in all this is the dad who majorly failed everyone in the narrative.", "You\u2019re not to blame for not wanting to be near her when you were young. You couldn\u2019t grasp the horrible situation your sister was in. But what your mother has done is unforgivable. She closed the door for a girl who just lost her mom. That\u2019s so so cruel.", "It seems like you're stuck on small \"lies\" opposed to the overall truth of the situation.\n\nDid you hear these directly from her or were these told second-hand from mutual friends she had talked with in the past. Because if that's the case, you didn't stop to consider that maybe they're misremembering what your sister told them.\n\nDid you even attempt to talk to your sister about these?\n\nEdit: It's also worth pointing out that your original post painted your sister as a bully when, based on your comments, she was likely responding to trauma and the failure of your parents. Your sister may have been biased when she told her story but you were also biased when you told yours.", "It sounds like your dad constantly failed to provide appropriate parenting and your mother stepped in to protect you from being an emotional punching bag", "No, they should have worked on a solution that wasn't completely rejecting one of their children. It's not like there were only two possibilities here.", "No they should have gotten both girls and the family therapy. Be there for both girls. Make rules. Be parents.", "So instead of clarifying that *hes* the problem, you just said she was lying. Even though she was telling the truth?", "She seems extremely proud that her mom kicked out her sister to keep the family \u201csafe\u201d from an 11y old, thats the part that rubs me the wrong way", "Though if Taylor has been living in that town for a while and she told people that narrative before OP moved there, she wasn\u2019t doing it to hurt OP. She was sharing her story. OP got there, became friends with the same group (which to me is such a red flag), and then decided to correct the narrative. Not share her story but correct the narrative. OP you are pretty childish and don\u2019t understand what being abandoned does to children or having a parent die when you are a child or have your father choose his other daughter and wife over you. All of these things happened to Taylor. NOT TO YOU. You cannot even let go of the fact that she bullied you when you were 8 but you expect Taylor to let go of the fact that\u2019s she was essentially abandoned by every adult as a child. Your attitude here, defending yourself also makes me question your story. I am not sure your are a reliable narrator. How much of it was bullying and how much of it was you not liking her and making sure she didn\u2019t come to \u201cyour home\u201d?\nYTA", "Pretty much. From Taylor but also from him. She left him because of how his behaviour was impacting me. He was/is a pretty toxic individual.", "Which is likely because her mother used it as an example of her \"protecting\" her and something that needed to be done.\n\nInstead of putting these kids in therapies and having them work through their issues like they should have.", "I mean I think all the adults suck here, she knew he wasn't a good father and choose to stay in the relationship and have an ultimatum about his child vs just leave and have him deal with it. \n\nI get that it's more complex than that but the adults failed the children here,a lot. \n\nIt also sounds like it wouldn't have mattered if he was in a relationship or not your sister was going to boarding school because he didn't want to deal with parenting", "Therapy is not the universal solution to everything", "Yeah, tbf his mental state deteriorated a lot as I got older and when I finally got my thoughts together enough to tell her how it was making me feel, she did leave him pretty quickly. It was a complicated time. \n\nMy dad could not be a single parent. He needed someone to do the leg work when he wanted to check out. I think he didn\u2019t leave my mom because he thought there was no point because he didn\u2019t want Taylor on his own.", "No, it's not perfect.\n\nHowever, it's significantly better than sending an 11 year old off to boarding school and isolating her from her dad after the death of her mother.\n\nEspecially since all she claimed her sister did was: \"break my things, upset my pets, and tell lies about me.\" Which all seem to be things that could easily be worked through with support of parents and normal sibling complaints on their own.\n\nI also question some of these, such as telling lies about her, since she claimed her sister was lying about her as an adult. Except her sister didn't, she just told her side of things and those things were true (OP proudly said that she and her mother were the reason she was sent to boarding school and not allowed to see the Dad except on rare occasions).\n\nIf her own friends are telling she could have been \"more gentle\" telling her side then that suggests she was aggressive and rough with how she depicted her sister. It's also telling that she's arguing with anyone who didn't tell her she was an innocent victim in these comments."]}
