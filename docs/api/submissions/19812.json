She bullied me really badly any time I saw her, to the point that I would scream every time my dad even mentioned her coming over. Even if we were kept apart, she would break my things, upset my pets, and tell lies about me. Every week her mom would end up in the kitchen screaming at my parents.\n\nTaylor's mom died when she was 11. Her mom didn't have any family able to take her in, and nor did my dad. My dad was the only one who could get custody.\nWhen I was told about this, I freaked out. Screaming, crying for hours, calling my grandparents and demanding to live with them, all of it. My mom wasn't willing to have Taylor in the house on that basis, and I'm pretty sure she said she would move out if my dad pushed the issue. Taylor ended up being sent to boarding school the next year, and she would go to stay with other members of my dad's family during breaks. When I was 14 my parents divorced, and I would see Taylor every few months at my dad's during school breaks. I'd learnt to stand up for myself and she'd grown up so there was no bullying, but we'd bicker - she was hostile and I never backed down. I didn't see her much after she went to college, and then I went to college far away as well.\n\nWe now live in the same small city (I moved here in March). It's the kind of place where everyone from each generation knows or knows of each other. I had never encountered Taylor socially and never mentioned knowing her, but I had met her boyfriend and his friends are part of my larger social group. The other night, I was at a party, and Taylor and her bf were there as well. We made eye contact and waved, but she pretty much avoided me all night. During the night, our mutual friends asked how I know Taylor, and I said we are half sisters. They all looked super uncomfortable and I pressed for an explanation. Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her. Were it not for the fact that it was obviously going to come out sooner or later that we are related, I probably wouldn't have bothered to set the record straight. As it was, I'm going to be around these people for a long time, and I didn't feel I should have had to walk around burdened by the weight of her lies. So I told the group the context.\n\nShe called me yesterday to yell at me. Apparently she's being ostracised from the group, her relationship is in trouble, her career opportunities are in jeopardy, etc. I don't see how any of this is my fault because she's the one who lied, but according to some people I should have been a bit more gentle in my retelling of the facts because it's her 'experience' and I've basically blackballed her.\n\nEDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t.

You moved to her city, joined up with her friend group, and when telling your side of the story en masse, you should have been more gentle and even perhaps more neutral - acknowledging you were BOTH CHILDREN when all this went down.

She acted horribly towards you but I imagine being shipped off to boarding school right after losing her mother was no walk in the park either. As far as consequences for bad behavior go, I'd say she probably had her fill. But what are you supposed to do? Be the evil stepsister forever?

After that, she never bothered you again. \n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t said a single thing that isn\u2019t true about you, your mom and her dad. She had left you alone, has not engaged at all with you. Your now adult, and your response is to bully her, lie about her, and cause her to loose all her friends, her boyfriend and her job.

You are definitely YTA", "YTA. She was a traumatized child lashing out you are an asshole adult inserting yourself into her life unprompted and being vindictive.

The family ends up needing outside help, or child services steps in and removes the child. It could have been a situation like that, but there\u2019s not enough details.\n\nEither way, Taylor got the shit end of the stick.

What she was doing and how she was behaving was probably something we wouldn't consider normal sibling bullying of course, but it is a normal child response to severe trauma. She should have been in therapy, and the household should have been heavily monitored and regulated to prevent any opportunity for her to bully you, to the best of your parents ability. \n\nI do not blame kids for acting like kids. These behaviours considering the circumstances and the ages are all typical and expected. I also would like to leave room for the fact that you don't know much about your dad's relationship with her mother and how that ended, even if you think you do. Parents keep secrets all the time, your mother and you may have been painted in a very bad light to her.\n\nAs you get older, you'll be able to see it from both sides, and hopefully be amicable.

The fact that everyone started backing away from her means that it tracks, that it is the Taylor they know. I don't see how getting a second side to the story on it's own does that.

The fact that those descriptors can be rightfully applied to Taylor doesn\u2019t stop the fact that she was a hateful child.\n\nOh, and her father abandoned her and made her homeless, her father chose to never really take her in. Her stop mother and daughter didn\u2019t make her homeless. \n\nThis whole comment is super biased and leaves out nearly all the context given.", "it is not 'essentially the truth'. it's a twisting of facts to fit her narrative. op and her mother were not responsible for what she went through. the burden is on ops dad for failing both his kids.", ">Her account of being homeless because her step sister and step mother hated her and wouldn't allow her in their home was essentially the truth. \n\nThis is what I thought too. Then OP added an edit: \n\n>EDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t. That was pretty much the gist of it.\n\nSo, it still might all have felt true to Taylor. Maybe she thinks the only reason her dad wouldn't give her money is beacuse OP must have told him not too. And even though her Dad still didn't raise her after the divorce, it may be easier to tell herself it was all the steps influence. I'm sure when it first happened it really did feel that way, though it also just seems like Dad is a bit of deadbeat.\n\nI feel very badly for Taylor but I'd say NTA. The asshole though are both OP's mom and Taylor's Dad (Dad more, but absolutely both of them). OP isn't an asshole here, if Taylor is going around telling other people things about OP that she feels are untrue so they hate her it makes sense for OP to tell her side of the story.

The truth was that she was kept out of the home because of a long pattern of extremely abusive behavior towards her sister.  That completely changes the situation because she goes from victim to offender.  That's also why she omitted that information (which is lying, it's called a lie by omission) because she knew that people would completely change how they view her, especially since she is completely unrepentant.", "Agreed. From Taylor\u2018s point of view, she told the truth - the fault lies with the adults that failed her, mostly her dad. \n\nDid Taylor paint herself in a more favorable light? Yes. But I\u2019m pretty sure that so did OP.", "Yea this is really the best comment.  I agree with it and was going to write something similar.  Taylor was abandoned by her family.  She was homeless because step mom and step sister hated her.  Yea she was a bully but damn.  She lost her mom, and then dad essentially told her he didn't want her.  That he wanted step mom and step sister more.  I'm surprised she isn't more fucked up as an adult.  That alone speaks volumes about her character.\n\nEdit:  Yes, step mom and step daughter had a reason to hate Taylor.  There is no denying that at all.  But we cannot deny that she was abandoned by her own family after her mom died either.  All around, the situation is terrible for everyone but dad. Dad fucked up big time and made all the wrong decisions.", "So what should OP have said instead?", "Actions have consequences.", "She was abandoned because she was a shit kid, it's her own fault and she went on and made a whole pity party for herself.
