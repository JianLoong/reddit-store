She bullied me really badly any time I saw her, to the point that I would scream every time my dad even mentioned her coming over. Even if we were kept apart, she would break my things, upset my pets, and tell lies about me. Every week her mom would end up in the kitchen screaming at my parents.\n\nTaylor's mom died when she was 11. Her mom didn't have any family able to take her in, and nor did my dad. My dad was the only one who could get custody.\nWhen I was told about this, I freaked out. Screaming, crying for hours, calling my grandparents and demanding to live with them, all of it. My mom wasn't willing to have Taylor in the house on that basis, and I'm pretty sure she said she would move out if my dad pushed the issue. Taylor ended up being sent to boarding school the next year, and she would go to stay with other members of my dad's family during breaks. When I was 14 my parents divorced, and I would see Taylor every few months at my dad's during school breaks. I'd learnt to stand up for myself and she'd grown up so there was no bullying, but we'd bicker - she was hostile and I never backed down. I didn't see her much after she went to college, and then I went to college far away as well.\n\nWe now live in the same small city (I moved here in March). It's the kind of place where everyone from each generation knows or knows of each other. I had never encountered Taylor socially and never mentioned knowing her, but I had met her boyfriend and his friends are part of my larger social group. The other night, I was at a party, and Taylor and her bf were there as well. We made eye contact and waved, but she pretty much avoided me all night. During the night, our mutual friends asked how I know Taylor, and I said we are half sisters. They all looked super uncomfortable and I pressed for an explanation. Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her. Were it not for the fact that it was obviously going to come out sooner or later that we are related, I probably wouldn't have bothered to set the record straight. As it was, I'm going to be around these people for a long time, and I didn't feel I should have had to walk around burdened by the weight of her lies. So I told the group the context.\n\nShe called me yesterday to yell at me. Apparently she's being ostracised from the group, her relationship is in trouble, her career opportunities are in jeopardy, etc. I don't see how any of this is my fault because she's the one who lied, but according to some people I should have been a bit more gentle in my retelling of the facts because it's her 'experience' and I've basically blackballed her.\n\nEDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t. That was pretty much the gist of it.\n\nEdit 2 (it was suggested I add this from the comments): I know the answer to these.\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t say to send her to boarding school. What my mom said was, Taylor is not living in this house with my daughter, if that means we split, then we split. My dad didn\u2019t want to be a full time parent by himself, so he stayed with my mom, and since he didn\u2019t have any other family Taylor could live with for various reasons, he sent her to boarding school.\n\nMy dad never cut contact with Taylor. He visited her at school (it was about an hour away) and sometimes he\u2019d see her at other relatives\u2019 places during school breaks. When he moved out, Taylor would occasional spend the day and maybe one break a year at his place.", "created_utc": 1686919745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aw0cn/aita_for_exposing_my_halfsisters_lies_about_our/", "score": 4493, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her account of being homeless because her step sister and step mother hated her and wouldn't allow her in their home was essentially the truth.

You didn't deserve to be bullied or terrorized in your own home, but she was YOUNG, clearly had awful parenting, and she needed more too. \n\nRealizing you didn't look great according to Taylor's account, I definitely think you handled it poorly. You moved to her city, joined up with her friend group, and when telling your side of the story en masse, you should have been more gentle and even perhaps more neutral - acknowledging you were BOTH CHILDREN when all this went down.

I cannot imagine the trauma that caused. On the other hand I can\u2019t imagine how hard it was for you dealing with someone like that.

Obviously not all kids are bullies, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she had the best childhood. To be sent away and be rejected by your family after the death of your mother has to do crazy damage on somebody.

You haven't taken into account what she was going through to act that way. From her perspective she was homeless because of her Dad's new family.

She acted horribly towards you but I imagine being shipped off to boarding school right after losing her mother was no walk in the park either. As far as consequences for bad behavior go, I'd say she probably had her fill. But what are you supposed to do? Be the evil stepsister forever? She couldn't seriously expect that.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible for other peoples lies.

After that, she never bothered you again. \n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t said a single thing that isn\u2019t true about you, your mom and her dad. She had left you alone, has not engaged at all with you. Your now adult, and your response is to bully her, lie about her, and cause her to loose all her friends, her boyfriend and her job.

The family ends up needing outside help, or child services steps in and removes the child. It could have been a situation like that, but there\u2019s not enough details.\n\nEither way, Taylor got the shit end of the stick.

What she was doing and how she was behaving was probably something we wouldn't consider normal sibling bullying of course, but it is a normal child response to severe trauma. She should have been in therapy, and the household should have been heavily monitored and regulated to prevent any opportunity for her to bully you, to the best of your parents ability. \n\nI do not blame kids for acting like kids. These behaviours considering the circumstances and the ages are all typical and expected. I also would like to leave room for the fact that you don't know much about your dad's relationship with her mother and how that ended, even if you think you do. Parents keep secrets all the time, your mother and you may have been painted in a very bad light to her.\n\nAs you get older, you'll be able to see it from both sides, and hopefully be amicable.

The fact that everyone started backing away from her means that it tracks, that it is the Taylor they know. I don't see how getting a second side to the story on it's own does that.

Then OP added an edit: \n\n>EDIT - I didn\u2019t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn\u2019t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn\u2019t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn\u2019t). I also told them it wasn\u2019t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor\u2019s business when she was 20\u2026because I didn\u2019t. That was pretty much the gist of it.\n\nSo, it still might all have felt true to Taylor. Maybe she thinks the only reason her dad wouldn't give her money is beacuse OP must have told him not too. And even though her Dad still didn't raise her after the divorce, it may be easier to tell herself it was all the steps influence. I'm sure when it first happened it really did feel that way, though it also just seems like Dad is a bit of deadbeat.\n\nI feel very badly for Taylor but I'd say NTA. The asshole though are both OP's mom and Taylor's Dad (Dad more, but absolutely both of them).

The truth was that she was kept out of the home because of a long pattern of extremely abusive behavior towards her sister.  That completely changes the situation because she goes from victim to offender.  That's also why she omitted that information (which is lying, it's called a lie by omission) because she knew that people would completely change how they view her, especially since she is completely unrepentant.", "Agreed. From Taylor\u2018s point of view, she told the truth - the fault lies with the adults that failed her, mostly her dad. \n\nDid Taylor paint herself in a more favorable light? Yes. But I\u2019m pretty sure that so did OP.", "Yea this is really the best comment.  I agree with it and was going to write something similar.  Taylor was abandoned by her family.  She was homeless because step mom and step sister hated her.  Yea she was a bully but damn.  She lost her mom, and then dad essentially told her he didn't want her.  That he wanted step mom and step sister more.  I'm surprised she isn't more fucked up as an adult.  That alone speaks volumes about her character.\n\nEdit:  Yes, step mom and step daughter had a reason to hate Taylor.  There is no denying that at all.

How was it said? Did she embellish it? We won't know because she glossed over her renditioning of her explanation.

You had disagreements as children but have both been failed by the same shitty father.

You seem to admit here that she isn\u2019t wrong to feel the way she feels (the abandonment) I think if she hears you say that it\u2019d go a long way.

The sister sounds like she was and still is pretty awful, but without completely dismissing any agency she has to behave differently, she was very young and clearly troubled when these patterns were forged, which is a problem that falls on the parents. It is her fault, however, that she either doesn\u2019t see or chooses not to work on these issues. She\u2019s in the wrong, but she was definitely failed when it came to parenting.", "Exactly, her Mom did her job. The Father didn\u2019t do his, even when given the opportunity after the divorce.

OP isNTA on this one; OP's FATHER was the asshole for abandoning his other daughter and Taylor is the asshole for lying about  how it went down. and Taylor is ALSO a victim in this because her dad did abandon her instead of divorcing to care for her.

He and his wife could have moved into separate houses and stayed married but shipping her off to boarding school and dumping her on his parents on vacation was easier.   \n\n\nIncidentally, if OP's father didn't take Taylor home AFTER the divorce, i don't put it past him to have lied to Taylor about why she wasn't allowed back or why she got no help.  Taylor clearly had shitty parents. Daddy didn't give a fuck about her and her mom was probably a shitty influence prior to dying.

Tbh, it's pretty fucked up that your mother refused to take her in and that she was sent to boarding school simply because you two couldn't get along. If anything, maybe she needed a little discipline. Not to mention that her mother died when she was 11. The trauma this girl has gone through! My heart breaks for her.\n\nYeah, OP, YTA.", "*\"Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her\"*\n\nYTA. THIS is exactly what happened. Where is the lie? You yourself describe this. She lost her Mom at 11 and rather than helping and empathizing with a broken child who is obviously going through trauma; divorce then her Mom's death, you and your mom would rather shun her, act like spoiled brats and cast her out. You never grew up, she did. Now you are being the bully. She is speaking the truth, again, a truth that **you** described exactly.", "YTA\n\nShe WAS hated by her stepmother and half sister and shipped off to boarding school. My God. She was a kid. She needed her dad to take care of her, to get her psychiatric help. Instead she got shipped away.", "ESH\nWhat you initially told us before the edit about her 'lies' was actually very much the truth from her perspective. She was shipped off to boarding school because her stepmom and stepsister didn't want her around. She was ignored and abandoned. \n\nShe behaved terribly as a child and continues to do so as an adult twisting the truth. But that doesn't absolve you for casting her as a big bag villain. \n\nYou need to grow up and realize that your parents failed her. They didn't do right by her and she was obviously a troubled kid lashing out because her dad got a new family and her mom was a bad parent up till her mom's passing. \n\nYou two are adults. Y'all need to find a way to burry the hatchet and move on. Even if she has never apologized to you it might help if you try apologizing for the things you did wrong. Set the tone for the future.

I'd be pissed off too. Not just pissed, but traumatized, damaged.\n\nI understand your hatred for her because of her bullying, but good grief,  y'all were kids.

I'd reach out to her and ask her to meet for a cup of coffee somewhere. \n\nTell her you're sorry for the way you behaved when you were a kid. Ask her what y'all can do to have a decent relationship.

I'm sure you both have something to offer one another.", "ESH, there's no way that saying that her bullying you as a kid bothered you so much that you didn't want her to move in was what put her in this situation.\n\nYou said something more, all her friends, br, and job are in trouble because she bullied a sibling as a kid? Nah, you definitely aren't telling the whole story.", "ESH \nYou and Taylor both did some serious spinning to make yourselves come out smelling like roses. Neither of you acted like angels.

I'm not saying that it makes the bullying acceptable but it may explain it.\n\nPlus, an 11-year old girl homeless, when her father is still alive, that isn't right either. He had a responsibility to raise her and he failed, simply because he didn't want to be a full time parent. He was so wrong!!

And, while I understand that nobody wants to admit to being a bully or an animal abuser when they were younger, as an adult we have to take accountability for our actions if we want to be better people. Your sister hasn't done that and it's pretty damn clear by how her personal and professional relationships are now blowing up as a result of your \"*truth*\" coming out that those who know her are already familiar with her behavior because she hasn't changed.", "Ah, yes.

At what point as an adult, do you show some empathy and understanding, and shed your childhood. She WAS homeless because of you and your shitty dad. How did she lie? You moved to her city, befriended her friends, and then completely obliterated her, without even as much as having a conversation with her about your childhood, and see how you can move forward. You are no longer the screaming, crying child that you were back then; you are an asshole for this. You have now become what you used to cry about.", "Why did the sister's social and professional life blow up so spectacularly just because some newcomer moves into town and disputes her story by saying \"actually she was homeless because she bullied me on the weekends when she was 10\".. it doesn't disprove what happened and it still makes OP look kind of bad. \n\nStory would be more believable if the result of you telling your side of the story didn't end in such a ridiculous way. YTA because this story is fake.", "INFO\n\nI think you both would benefit from you talking to your mom about everything. Get clarification: was it mom's idea to send Taylor to boarding school? Did mom make dad cut contact with Taylor? If yes, then Taylor at least isn't lying about her step mom. But she is an AH for lying about you, when she simply assumed you had a hand in it. And seeing that she lied about some random thing when she was 20 makes me think she just is not inclined to tell the truth. Or at least she embellishes things. It makes me wonder, actually. If dad refused to give her money because he needed money for you and he told her that. In that way, you *were* the reason why she couldn't get money from dad, but it's not like you begged daddy to cut off your sister.", "YTA OP, and at this point a pretty massive one. She didn't lie about anything. She was abandoned by her family because of you and your mom. She was homeless because of it. \n\nI'm sure as far as she knew you DID live with your dad, whether she only saw you there every once in a while doesn't matter, because she was only there once in a while.\n\nThe only thing you've said is definitely a lie was about your dad refusing to fund her business because of you, and you can't even say that's actually a lie. You don't know what conversations she has had with your father, and you certainly can't say what he has or hasn't told her.\n\nSHE DID NOT LIE.\n\nThat was her side of the story, which she's allowed to tell the friend group she's amassed. She didn't tell her story for you, she told her friends HER TRUTH so they could get to know her. \n\nYou are not children anymore OP. Taylor's life has already been completely destabilized because she was a  bit of an asshole when she was a kid, why do you feel the need to do that to her as an adult?", "YTA.  Technically she was \"homeless\".  Boarding school is NOT a home, it is a school.  This CHILD lost the only blood relative who apparently cared about her, and was treated like an unwanted inconvenience by her remaining relatives, including her own FATHER.  (How absolutely generous of him to visit her at school occasionally).  This girl got denied the love of a family - of COURSE she lashed out!  You should really put yourself in her shoes and stop blaming a PARENTLESS, UNLOVED CHILD for being angry at being COMPLETELY ABANDONED.  As the mother of step children I am appalled that your mom didn't try to embrace this essentially orphaned young woman who had no mother of her own to guide her or attempt to embrace her.  And then you take a wrecking ball to the friends she obtained, probably feeling acceptance and empathy for the first time, convincing them that she has lied and that (once again!!!!) you are a golden boy whose word is more reputable?  Honestly you should be ashamed of yourself.  Very sad for her.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get what other people are saying. She told her side of the story, you provided yours.

Your dad, and Taylor\u2019s mom are AHs. Sounds like dad was too passive, and didn\u2019t really want to parent, and it seems like Taylor\u2019s mom fed into her negative behaviors. You were just a child, and did not deserve to be tortured and bullied by her. Your mother did the right thing to protect you. She had no obligation to allow a rotten child like Taylor into her home to live. And it sounds like Taylor is a rotten adult now too. \n\nMy brother was like Taylor, except no one did a single thing to protect me from him. He never even got any form of punishment. I had to deal with being beat up, bullied, my things broken, my homework destroyed, for about 20 years.", "NTA I love how people just try and excuse he terrible behavior as a child.

You were a child being bullied (initially other comments you mention pulling hair and calling you names and etc). All of this for an eight-year old without siblings prior would have been scary. I'm not dismissing that she bullied you, and I'm not saying it was okay, but she was also a child. \n\nLike kids make other kids cry all the fucking time, it doesn't mean one of them is an evil person, at 8 years old - your emotional responses are still not really always appropriate. \n\nShe was a child probably lashing out in the only way she knew how, while the world collapsed and she lost her mother, then her home, and then got shipped off to boarding school. \n\nAs someone with siblings who was also bullied severally, children bullyeach other- its a fact of life. It sounds like she was extreme, so im sorry for you. That sucked but I wouldn't deny one child a family and a place to live because they were mean to another child at 11? Have you met an 11 year recently - at that age, they fucking love brutal honesty (like the John Mulaney bit) and push boundaries. \n That's crazy and vindictive. Her mother died/or was dying -  there will be difficult to manage emotions for the most emotionally stable adult, never-ending a fucking child.\n\nDid your mom just hate your dad's ex and couldn't bear to see her because that's the vibe I got from reading between the lines.\n\n\n\nPlus, because this is a one-sided story, I don't want to dismiss the idea that you're remembering a tale through tinted lenses (because you were eight and nobody's memory is perfect or maybe someone  has repeatedly told you this story adding bits of flair as you go on, because i reall doubt you reme specifics from that time cause you were so young). \n\nBut what she told her friends seems to be an accurate (if exaggerated) version of the same story. She (11) didn't get along with another child (8). Then her mother died, she had nowhere to go but her father's house, this was blocked because the other child's mother refused to let her live with her - because apparently an 11 year was so unmanageable. \n\nI think your mom didn't like this child or her mother, and that your shitty father didn't do the right thing - but you cannot seriously think you're the only victim here. \n\nThat's what happened, her mother died and then she was shipped off to boarding school and not permitted to come live with her only remaining family because your mom said no and your dad is spineless. \n\nFor you, a girl was mean to you/tormented you at the age of eight, so you got your mom to make sure she got sent off to boarding school and saw her a few times after this?", "ESH. This is an ongoing communication and problem- solving issue that started when your parents figured that boarding school was the only feasible option for Taylor, and continues to this day when you \"set her story straight.\" I get that a lot of her story could be exaggerated, but it definitely sounds (even just from your perspective) like she has been ostracized from her family by you and your mother (and later her father), and I don't doubt she's been homeless, even as a kid. All OP did was slam that final nail in the coffin, which is Taylor's ability to trust in family support.\n\nThings your folks could have done instead: trying to work with the kids about their behavior together and separately, while still having them spend some regular time together (especially after building a decent mutual relationship). Sending one kid off to boarding school and keeping the other at home, is not very cool.\n\nThings Taylor could have done differently: lying or not, she doesn't need to rely on a sad upbringing to gain a social footing. \n\nThings OP could do differently: check your privilege for one.  You word your post as if Taylor is THE problem, period, but what have YOU done to be the bigger person and not engage in the drama?

It's like something out of Oliver Twist. I'm heartbroken for that girl. She was failed by her biological parents at every turn.\n\nOP and her mother, however, had no say in that.

I find reddit has a tendency to focus on the facts given by OP and OP only without any reading between lines or interpretation skills. Taylor, at around 3 years of age had to deal with 1) parents splitting due to differences OR 2) her father potentialy having an affair and therefore parents splitting due to that reason. Lets NOT dismiss that this could very well be a side of the truth that we are not presented with.   \nHATE ME ALL YOU WANT, BUT frankly speaking the other thing is that we dont know the true facts and extent of the proclaimed bullying that OP had to endure on weekends when Taylor was over. From this post it feels like nobody in Taylor's life was ever on her side at her youth, maybe it was the lack of love received that caused her to act out and \"bully\" OP. Her father wasnt there to support or lend a listening ear to Taylor.   \nI do not blame Taylor for being a bully for a few years of her YOUTH, but the parents who created the atmosphere for such and didnt help her perhaps seek therapy.   \nAlot happened in Taylor's life during her youth and he is 100% valid for stating that she was abandoned.

Sending an 11 year old to boarding school so you can keep your dick wet is child abuse.   \nIs Taylor lying now? Not really.

I know he comes into town a fair bit but he doesn\u2019t normally see her because I\u2019m close to his gf and she told me. \n\nHe\u2019s had some therapy, but not enough to admit just how much of a problem he was.", "obviously but that\u2019s not why i asked what i asked. the person i replied to was saying it\u2019s the mother\u2019s fault not the fathers.", "If telling the truth about her actions paints her as the bad guy then yes she was the bad guy. This comment is ridiculous. You want her to downplay the severe abuse she faced at her sisters hands bc it makes her look bad???", "The father sucks but I don't see how the OP does. She's not responsible for her father's horrible decisions.", ">your original post painted your sister as a bully when, based on your comments, she was likely responding to trauma and the failure of your parents. \n\nWhat is this horse shit? She was a bully straight up. Being traumatized doesn\u2019t change that fact. It\u2019s not biased to correctly say that someone bullies you, regardless of why they did because they still did. Also, what trauma? She was bullying OP for years _before_ all this abandonment stuff happened. Back when she had weekly visits with her dad. So you can\u2019t pin this on trauma that happened after the fact\n\nY\u2019all have so much to to say about her sisters trauma, but a startling lack of regard about that the trauma that OP an even younger child undoubtably sustained from being mercilessly abused in her own home", "For sure I understand this. I think that\u2019s probably what happened. I went to therapy and believe me I made up every reason under the sun why my dad was the way he was so that it wouldn\u2019t be his fault, because who wants to believe you have a parent like that? A parent to whom you are simply not important? It sucks. \n\nIt\u2019s just unfortunate that we know the same people, really, and that the telling of the story was so detailed.", "What is this bs? \n\nI commented a really long comment and just that last part hit, huh?\n\n>now she has to be at all the same dinner parties as you? \n\nShe doesn\u2019t. She chooses to go. OP shouldn\u2019t be banned from seeing her bf\u2019s friends bc someone abused her as a child. How\u2019s that fair to her or him?\n\n>Her boyfriend hangs out with yours all the time? Can you not see how this sucks for her? \n\nAnd how is she supposed to control that? Tell her bf not to see his friends.\n\n>This is her town, \n\nYou don\u2019t own a town. She doesn\u2019t get to banish op or prevent her from moving to be with her bf bc she abused her.\n\n>told her life story, as she believed it, not to turn them against you but just as conversation about her life.\n\nShe straight up lied. Literally made up conversations and incidents that never happened to slander her sister and mother for the crime of being abused.\n\n>you weren\u2019t wrong in this situation\n\nThen she isn\u2019t TA in this situation", "So you can come back and respond to this part but you are too much of a wuss to respond to all the other comments pointing out that this would mean you want him to leave his other child. You basically want him to leave one child for the other child as if only the bully was his kid. \n\nI get there are no good options here, but you are just blatantly ignoring facts.", ">each parent needs to put their children first!\n\nYou seem to forget that the dad had two children...\n\nSaying that the dad needed to put both of them first doesn't make any sense. It logically isn't possible, there's only one \"first\" spot. Dad choosing one child would inherently mean giving up the other child. \n\nThis wording doesn't work well when you consider that OP and Taylor are BOTH their dad's bio children. If he took in Taylor, he would have had to give up access to OP; he wouldn't even be able to have her over for weekend visitations like he did because Taylor's presence would make his home unsafe for OP. So he would have had to abandon OP instead. After all, this is effectively what happened to Taylor when he put his other child, OP, \"first\" instead of balancing both their needs like he should have done.\n\nObviously dad should have stepped up more. Balancing competing needs equally takes work, and he clearly wasn't willing to bother. His is completely at fault here - he managed to fail *both* of his children in different ways.", "I usually lurk here to kill time. But it is kind of worrying how quickly people on this sub will suggest the nuclear option based on one side of the story.", "As evidenced by that upvote count. Good lord.", "yeah - what were they doing in the years before taylors mom died??? she clearly needed help", "But at 14 she stopped being a bully by OP\u2019s own standards. \n\nIf she\u2019s as manipulative as you claim, why did she stop?", "Some people are born assholes?? Dude you must be one of them!", "How do you know she made that up, though? How do you know their shitty dad didn't lie to her? How do you know she sees herself as a bully rather than someone defending herself against her replacements?\n\nBoth of their sides of the story can be the truth. All it takes is a different perspective.", "Ohh sorry yes, I follow now that it was a rhetorical question. Sorry mate, my bad!", "so are we just ignoring the child neglect? they were both kids and all adults in this situation failed them.", "It's pretty normal/sane for children to come up with a narrative of an evil stepmother rather than the reality of their mom dying and then their father abandoning them.", "You do understand people divorce without \u201cleaving their children\u201d right? It\u2019s called shared custody. If my wife left and I only got weekend visitation, would that make me an absentee father? \n\nIf they needed to live in separate homes, they should have done so. That\u2019s what any parent would do.", "Parents separating or divorcing is not the same thing as leaving their child which would be the worst case scenario....the two may have understood the reasons and be able to keep the marriage intact. You're kind of a huge dick for implying that any parent that gets divorced suddenly abandoned their child and is leaving them. How insulting to so many great parents that keep their child in their life. I am gonna go give my dad a hug and thank him for doing so because your comment is disgusting all because you wanted to try and win an internet argument.", "Exactly. And that\u2019s where OP is a bit of an asshole. And could use a bit of empathy. Because she\u2019s not wrong, she was abandoned because her stepmother and half sister didn\u2019t like her.", "Or maybe she was a bully because she was the genetic offspring of the screaming woman and the self-centered uncaring dad? There\u2019s a lot of debate in the scientific world about whether bad parenting creates problems for children or whether people who are bad at social connection produce children who are bad at social connection. Studies on monozygotic twins raised apart seem to point the finger at heritability .\n\nI\u2019m not a psychologist nor a geneticist, so I have no strong opinion either way, just worth considering. Certainly sounds like Taylor is a lot like her parents.", "Reminds me of this story [\"I stood by and allowed my wife to almost kill our son. I was happy she did it.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/c93egn/i_stood_by_and_allowed_my_wife_to_almost_kill_our/) a father told about his son. \n\nAn extremely rare case and I'm in no way comparing Taylor to this boy, just an interesting story related to your question.\n\nWarning - It's extremely graphic and disturbing", "I\u2019m not the one who commented but I do think there are evil babies. There\u2019s stories of kids doing horrendous things despite being brought up by love and care and yes we don\u2019t know what happens behind closed doors, but I find it hard to believe that everyone pops out the womb an innocent angel.", "Children need to learn what's good and bad, they have empathy obviously they can learn things on their own but sometimes they can be little shits, I remember being good enough to know I have to help people, respect rules and pay attention to school and do my homework but still bothering my brother knowing he would be blamed because he was older, the moment we fought and I lost and my parents did nothing because I deserved it that's the moment I learned another thing.\n\nChildren need to be taught many things.", "No, there are no \u2018evil\u2019 babies. But there are babies born that are incapable of feeling chemical empathy. They can still be taught cognitive empathy, and to function and be decent human beings but if they have a neglectful / shitty / volatile parent ( which it sounds like Taylor\u2019s mother was if she never got her daughter help and her response to her daughter being a bully was to scream at OP\u2019s parents ) then that\u2019s a recipe for becoming a nightmare of a child.", "If you have no argument except to insult me then you have no argument.", "I think you can acknowledge that something in Taylor's upbringing was hugely flawed and that was likely why she was such a terror and apparently continues to be an unpleasant adult, while at the same time understanding that at a certain point in your life, continuing that behavior is a choice.", "Everyone pops out of the womb an undeveloped lump of goo that can learn.", "Yes, but that \"certain point\" was sometime between the ages of 3 and 11. \nAll OP has said about Taylor after age 11 is that she was \"hostile\", and that she \"lied\" about OP to her friends. OP does also acknowledge that by that point Taylor had \"grown up\", and that OP \"wouldn't back down\".\nThe hostility at that point is easy to understand - rightly or wrongly, and whether that 11 year old \"deserved\" it she was completely abandoned by her only parent and sent away from family at her most vulnerable, after losing her mother, while her half sister got to be part of a family.ily with the father who didn't want her any more. Any 11 year old is going to resent OP in that situation, even if it was one wholly of their own doing. (Which I think is somewhat harsh given their ages and circumstances).\nAnd of the \"lies\", the bulk of it was 100% true, and the rest may not be deliberate lies but the result of Taylor having a chip on her shoulder or paranoia towards OP and her father. (She may genuinely believe that her father still didn't want her back because of Op, and didn't fund her business because of OP).", "Yes.  Poor people can afford thousands or tens in thousands in therapy and meds. They're such bad parents for being poor. Why don't they just buy more money?"]}
