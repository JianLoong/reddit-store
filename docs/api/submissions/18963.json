Is this generally how your dynamic works? How bad or serious is her reaction going to be? I guess what I'm saying is, will there be a huge reaction from your sister and is that worth it. \n\nIf you continue to rent equipment could think about discussing some terms and conditions - if she wasn't renting from family she would be charged extra for returning equipment without cleaning.  It's also arguably teaching her how to run a business which she isn't going to do if you keep covering for her lack of planning and organisation.\n\nI don't mean any criticism with any of the above.

You did a good thing. She probably has the confidence to pick things up gain once she has the time and energy. \n\nSince you are in the business for a longer haul, you can\u2019t afford to support her side gig by depleting your supplies.

I tend to feel guilty when I put people through tough situations", "I think saying that \\*would\\* make you the AH - but you don't need to frame it that way. You can just say that unfortunately you're finding it inconvenient to lend her things and give her ingredients, and unfortunately she doesn't always return items in the condition in which she received them, so you need to step back.", "If you're feeling generous about those orders, treat this like an eviction. Give her a date that allows her to finish those orders so she can buy supplies, and make it very clear that no so much as a toothpick is to be shared after that date.", "Good idea, then there's been fair warning but you won't feel as if you're leaving her in the lurch. You shouldn't feel guilty - the tough situation is being caused by her not you!"]}
