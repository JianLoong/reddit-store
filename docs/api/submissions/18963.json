That might get her to figure out how to order better for however much longer she stays in business.

You should also be charging her higher than market rate for ingredients. Your pricing needs to include convenience fees for not having to plan ahead.\n\nAnd, if she reaches out in the middle of the night trying to buy ingredients, charge her an extra fee for being an AH.\n\nIf she doesn't want to pay the new, higher rental fees and higher prices for ingredients, she's welcome to go elsewhere.

You can stop that by adjusting your pricing instead of shutting her off cold turkey.", "As a big brother, I feel you. Little brothers and sisters have the tendency to push the limits.\nI think you can make a deal with her. First, you have to know how long she will continue the business. There is a huge difference between several months and several years. Depending on this time, you should consider whether to rent or not and what the rent would be.\n Second, you have to place some ground rules with some penalty clauses. e.g. She may not leave the equipment dirty.

Anyone else, you'd just tell to fuck off when they take advantage of you like this.", "Sounds like she\u2019s a shitty employee and sister then. NTA and she should stop supporting her.", "Maybe you can subcontract things to her, like making figurines etc and paying her for them, or hiring her and paying an hourly rate to make these.", "NTA\n\"It's affecting your ability to run your business, plan supply orders, etc\n\nShe needs to do better at her own sourcing and you are only renting equipment when it is returned clean.\"\n\nBe clear with your expectations and communication. Let her know if it doesn't improve, the arrangement ends but you'd prefer for things to go well.", "It was considered, but I decided not to as I know that it would become an issue for me, since she has worked for me before and near the end she started becoming lazy and didn\u2019t want to work so much. Her dealing with her own customers helped her feel the pressure and demands of business and it motivated her to work harder. Working under me just made her lazy. \nWe do share some customers though", "Hmm.. true. I did tell her that if I was anyone else, she wouldn\u2019t of treated them the same way she treats me and my equipment. We both have separate areas where we keep our things, but my space is a lot bigger and sometimes she will peep into my section to see what I have so she can buy/use it when she \u2018runs out\u2019", "Right?\ud83d\ude2d I also mentioned to her that I didn\u2019t have everything when I started baking, but I slowly made my way up and If I didn\u2019t have something I needed, I would try and figure something out. \n\nFor the ingredients yes, whenever we take trips to the supplier or If I order online, she will buy her things with me, but she only orders just enough to last her few weeks, or less.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is taking advantage of you because she can and you being there is a convenience to her.\n\nIf you weren't there she would have to purchase all of her ingredients and buy all of her own equipment. She has all that conveniently with you **why should she have to spend her own money.**\n\nHer returning equipment dirty is  EXTREMELY rude and inconsiderate as that was not how she received them.\n\nStop helping your sister. Part of being a business owner is being RESPONSIBLE for your own business.", "If she doesn\u2019t clean a pan, cleaning fee of $20 per item. If she needs an ingredient it\u2019s double the price. If she wants to manage a business the only way she will learn is through the hip pocket. NTA", "Damn, this is actually really true.", "She can get 70% of that back on her taxes since it's business experience. Renting equipment is costing her more than just buying.", "How about a paperclip croissant? \ud83d\udcce\ud83e\udd50"]}
