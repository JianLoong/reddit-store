I am anemic so, I have to eat meat daily. When I have been to a vegan BBQ, I make a pasta salad with chicken and avocado, which is eaten cold and brought over in an insulated lunchbox.

Hard to say, them not accommodating for your allergy is rude. I do think you should bring this up with them. You bringing animal products into a vegan home is also rude. \n\nSo from my point of view,, if they refuse to accommodate you, you can take the aggressive approach can be rude back, bring meat.

The most sane thing to do would be to decline an invite from a host that seems like they want to poison you.", "I do think you'd be the asshole.

Of the total people going, 6 of 9 aren't vegans. \nAnytime a meal is hosted elsewhere we have two meals, one vegan and one not, so everyone can enjoy what they like. Not here though, this is a strictly vegan household. No cooking meat products on the BBQ. No cheese, no eggs, no fish. \n\nI get not wanting to cook meat on their bbq, I have an entire section of my grill sectioned off for vegan/gluten free cooking. \n \nI found out what they are making for everyone one. I'm allergic to mushrooms, and they know it, and their main course is a portobello steak, it feels on purpose. \n\nI would feel disrespected as a host if a guest brought their own food to my dinner party, then again I try really hard to make sure everyone has options for them at mine. \n\nSo WIBTA If I brought a George foreman and some burgers to cook up outside?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I think you need to call them and remind them you\u2019re allergic to mushrooms. If they offer an alternative, great. If not, I think your best option is to just not go. \n\nYour question was will you be the AH if you bring a \u201cGeorge foreman and some burgers to cook up outside\u201d\nYes YWBTA. Try to find a resolution with the hosts. Or do not attend", "YWBTA. Tell them about your allergy and ask if you can bring yourself something without mushrooms. If they say yes, ask if you can bring cooked meat and then live with the answer you get. I'm not a fan of veganism but cooking raw meat in a vegan home is a serious AH move", "Stupid question. People usually give advanced notice of the menu of a dinner party Incase there is an issue for any guests expected to consume it, right? So, if the dish doesn't accommodate you, you say something to the host, so they can make an adjustment. \n\nI can't tell you how many times I have offered my friend shrimp, forgetting she's allergic to shellfish. Lucky, she knows I'm an idiot and reminds me she's allergic. But my other friend, I never forget he's allergic to potatoes. I've known shellfish for 11 years, and known potatoes for much less, hang out not even once a month. \n\nPeople are human. If you don't remind your hosts and just bring food, YTA. If they don't accommodate your allergy, different story. \n\nI would get a small grill and grill a cow in their back yard, but I also have complete awareness i WBTA if I did that.

At the same time, I'd no longer make concessions for that specific person/household going forward, aside from maybe making one substitute item for them.", "Info:Have you spoken to the host about bringing your own food or your allergies?", "NTA. Vegan people are vegan of their own choice, and if their going to cook food for you that your allergic to, and you make them separate meals when they come over for food, they can get over people doing the same to them. being vegan is a *personal* choice, they have a fragile ego if they can't handle having meat in their home when they have company over", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a preference this is an allergy. Bring your own stuff and if they say something just simply say \u201cI\u2019m allergic to mushrooms\u201d.

You didn\u2019t say anything when they told you so you need to implement another plan which is BYOB (burgers)", "Yes, bringing raw meat and asking to cook it in a vegan/vegetarian home is a huge AH move. YWBTA if you do this. Many (most?) vegetarians/vegans are completely repulsed by raw meat and bringing it into their home would be incredibly disrespectful.", "OP  please, just don't go!!! \n\nIf they know about your allergy and they are going to make dishes with what you can't eat and they don't allow non-vegan food, then don't go.  It will be better not to go than to break their rules.  Probably your presence is not important to them if they are going to cook mushrooms.\n\nJust don't go\n\nEdit: YWBTA", "YWBTA, because they have been clear about not wanting animal products at their house.

And if it's beyond burgers and you can't share a grill, then let them know you'd like to bring your own to avoid cross contamination.", "YTA.

Them being vegans don't really have anything to do with this if the food you're bringing is also vegan. \n\nBringing your own food when you can't eat what they serve is fine not the AH wise but they still might get offended. You need to speak to them about it. Remind them you are allergic to mushrooms and that you want to bring a different vegan substitute with you and prepare it there. \n\nYou wrote this really strangely because I thought you meant meat burgers with wanting to grill them outside and the bringing up them being vegan multiple times.", "YWBTA if you just show up with your own grill. \n\nA simple call or text reminding them of your allergy would do, if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t accommodate you, eat before the party and go just to hang out, or don\u2019t go at all.", "Ywbta if you took meat.

The ones that you describe, and the ones who push back against any further restrictions, because they've *already* restricted their diet and thus resent being asked to cook without yet *another* thing. Especially if it's a vegan replacer that happens to make up a significant portion of their normal diet, *because* of the fact that they can't eat meat. Some people will push back against that.\n\nAlso, there's a venn diagram of people who are vegans and people who don't believe in medicine - and thus, don't believe in stuff like allergies. It's not a circle, but suffice it to say there is some overlap.\n\nIt basically comes down to this: vegans, much like everyone else, are not a monolith, and they don't all think the same way. Just like how in my industry, we get customers who have worked in our field and thus are more forgiving - and we have customers who have worked in our field and are thus *less* forgiving.", "Bullshit. I\u2019m not allergic to anything. No one in my family is.\n\nEvery time I make something for someone, I still ask if they had allergies. \n\nBest case scenario, I saved someone\u2019s life. Worst case scenario, I prevented a life from being endangered. \n\nRaises all of 3 seconds, makes you look and feel good, and costs nothing. \n\nIt\u2019s a matter of being a decent human being. End of.", ">the vegan detail is truly irrelevant. Non-vegans can eat vegan food one time at a dinner party\n\nThat means vegans can also eat meat once at a dinner party right?\n\nChange needs to go both ways.", "It's curious because reading the post I actually thought the contrary about being self-absorbed... \"ok but what is the problem with people who eat meat and need to always eat it and can't stand a meal without animal derivates\" lol \n\nThe allergy is a problem. It needs to be addressed (and it should be regardless of you being vegan or not, since meat eaters can be allergic too, it is a separate issue). And if the hosts really are ignoring her allergy without offering alternatives, they are bad hosts. But if A) they didn't realize (why the first instinct of OP isn't to remind them? Maybe because at the end of the day, OP just wants to bring meat without giving them the option to offer an alternative?) B) or they are actually preparing alternatives, WHY OP feels the need to bring meat inside a vegan home? Why she can't go for some hours without eating meat? It's embarrassing imho. Like, a meat eater can easily have a vegan meal (and a lot do, especially in some countries culinary traditions which are heavily vegetarian so relatively easily modifiable). Always needing to have meat in your dinner/lunch isn't normal and especially if you go out of your way to bring meat to events that manage to have a full dinner without it imho. It's just in your head at that point, always wanting to eat it just because \"I am not vegan, how dare you offer me a vegan dinner once in a lifetime\", it's ridiculous come on...", "This. The Golden Rule applies here - treat others how you would like to be treated. If you would find the behaviour insulting, don't do it to someone else.", "That's awesome for you. But people are humans and make mistakes. Things slip people's minds all the time. That's awesome that you're so perfect at remembering every little detail about that. Not everyone is capable of that, even when they desperately want to be. \n\nIt sounds like when it was first discussed, it was an idea. When things were solidified so far, OP doesn't appear to have made a comment about it too ask since. Do you know how many times I've been like \"this sounds yummy\" and have someone tell me they couldn't, only to a little while later (be it and say or says or weeks or whenever) be like \"we should go try this thing that sounded yummy\" simply because I'm excited about that thing i wanted to try and be told that whoever can't eat it. It's easy for me to goo \"oh yeah. Okay maybe I'll do that another time\" i still actively try to be mindful, but it's an active thing that takes way more effort for me than out sounds like it does you. Not because i don't care, but simply because my brain struggles to hold on to everything single important detail. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with saying that OP should have just asked when it was solidified. A simple \"hey like i mentioned, i can't eat that. Is there going to be an option\" because it's simple. \n\nPlus it's different when you have a whole group of people with the same accommodation vs one person with a specific one that doesn't affect every single meal (in the sense that mushrooms aren't in everything or every recipe. Though they are admittedly in a lot of vegan recipes). It's easier to keep track of a regular large amount of the same than a small singular thing. I'm not saying both aren't equally important, of course they are. Just one is easier to keep track of. And OP didn't mention that this is a frequent problem. Just this once. Could it be, possibly. But they didn't say it is", "Yes and as most comments are saying, OP should inform/remind the hosts that he has a mushroom allergy and ask them about him bringing his own alternative or them making an alternative.\n\nBringing vegan food into a non-vegetarian house is not the same as bringing meat into a vegans house", "It's easy to keep track of things when it's specifically brought to your attention when you bring it up in the first place. This isn't something that he's hoping they'll just remember. He literally brought it at the time they suggested it and they clearly don't care. If you're so absent minded that you can't remember that someone said they can't eat the thing you said you were going to make at the very moment you said it, then you have some problems. No need to be perfect. Just don't need an AH.", ">Bringing vegan food into a non-vegetarian house is not the same as bringing meat into a vegans house\n\nAnd remembering/providing a medically necessary restriction/alternative is not the same as a moral restriction/alternative.  OP wasn't even asking about bringing meat to the hosts house but a separate vegan burger."]}
