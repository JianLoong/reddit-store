Of course the foreman grill may be a bit much.", "YWBTA don't get me wrong they're not the best hosts, but I wouldn't make an ass of yourself as a guest.

I am anemic so, I have to eat meat daily. When I have been to a vegan BBQ, I make a pasta salad with chicken and avocado, which is eaten cold and brought over in an insulated lunchbox.

Hard to say, them not accommodating for your allergy is rude. I do think you should bring this up with them. You bringing animal products into a vegan home is also rude. \n\nSo from my point of view,, if they refuse to accommodate you, you can take the aggressive approach can be rude back, bring meat.

The most sane thing to do would be to decline an invite from a host that seems like they want to poison you.", "I do think you'd be the asshole.

Of the total people going, 6 of 9 aren't vegans. \nAnytime a meal is hosted elsewhere we have two meals, one vegan and one not, so everyone can enjoy what they like. Not here though, this is a strictly vegan household. No cooking meat products on the BBQ. No cheese, no eggs, no fish. \n\nI get not wanting to cook meat on their bbq, I have an entire section of my grill sectioned off for vegan/gluten free cooking. \n \nI found out what they are making for everyone one. I'm allergic to mushrooms, and they know it, and their main course is a portobello steak, it feels on purpose. \n\nI would feel disrespected as a host if a guest brought their own food to my dinner party, then again I try really hard to make sure everyone has options for them at mine. \n\nSo WIBTA If I brought a George foreman and some burgers to cook up outside?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I think you need to call them and remind them you\u2019re allergic to mushrooms. If they offer an alternative, great. If not, I think your best option is to just not go. \n\nYour question was will you be the AH if you bring a \u201cGeorge foreman and some burgers to cook up outside\u201d\nYes YWBTA. Try to find a resolution with the hosts. Or do not attend", "YWBTA. Tell them about your allergy and ask if you can bring yourself something without mushrooms. If they say yes, ask if you can bring cooked meat and then live with the answer you get. I'm not a fan of veganism but cooking raw meat in a vegan home is a serious AH move", "Stupid question. People usually give advanced notice of the menu of a dinner party Incase there is an issue for any guests expected to consume it, right? So, if the dish doesn't accommodate you, you say something to the host, so they can make an adjustment. \n\nI can't tell you how many times I have offered my friend shrimp, forgetting she's allergic to shellfish. Lucky, she knows I'm an idiot and reminds me she's allergic. But my other friend, I never forget he's allergic to potatoes. I've known shellfish for 11 years, and known potatoes for much less, hang out not even once a month. \n\nPeople are human. If you don't remind your hosts and just bring food, YTA. If they don't accommodate your allergy, different story. \n\nI would get a small grill and grill a cow in their back yard, but I also have complete awareness i WBTA if I did that.

At the same time, I'd no longer make concessions for that specific person/household going forward, aside from maybe making one substitute item for them.", "Info:Have you spoken to the host about bringing your own food or your allergies?", "NTA. Vegan people are vegan of their own choice, and if their going to cook food for you that your allergic to, and you make them separate meals when they come over for food, they can get over people doing the same to them. being vegan is a *personal* choice, they have a fragile ego if they can't handle having meat in their home when they have company over", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a preference this is an allergy. Bring your own stuff and if they say something just simply say \u201cI\u2019m allergic to mushrooms\u201d.

You didn\u2019t say anything when they told you so you need to implement another plan which is BYOB (burgers)", "Yes, bringing raw meat and asking to cook it in a vegan/vegetarian home is a huge AH move. YWBTA if you do this. Many (most?) vegetarians/vegans are completely repulsed by raw meat and bringing it into their home would be incredibly disrespectful.", "OP  please, just don't go!!! \n\nIf they know about your allergy and they are going to make dishes with what you can't eat and they don't allow non-vegan food, then don't go.  It will be better not to go than to break their rules.  Probably your presence is not important to them if they are going to cook mushrooms.\n\nJust don't go\n\nEdit: YWBTA", "YWBTA, because they have been clear about not wanting animal products at their house.

And if it's beyond burgers and you can't share a grill, then let them know you'd like to bring your own to avoid cross contamination.", "YTA.

I would just talk to them with a friendly reminder that you are allergic.", "If you're bringing Beyond Burgers then just mention it to them. You can't eat what they're serving. Them being vegans don't really have anything to do with this if the food you're bringing is also vegan. \n\nBringing your own food when you can't eat what they serve is fine not the AH wise but they still might get offended. You need to speak to them about it. Remind them you are allergic to mushrooms and that you want to bring a different vegan substitute with you and prepare it there. \n\nYou wrote this really strangely because I thought you meant meat burgers with wanting to grill them outside and the bringing up them being vegan multiple times.", "YWBTA if you just show up with your own grill. \n\nA simple call or text reminding them of your allergy would do, if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t accommodate you, eat before the party and go just to hang out, or don\u2019t go at all.", "Ywbta if you took meat.

Cooking it there is obviously wrong, but if I have to bring my own food, why not a ham sandwich. It would be different if you were doing it with ill intent, though. If it was because he just didnt want to eat vegan food I would disagree with bringing something, but he is allergic, and they didn't provide analternativer.", "Familial obligations. \n\nI would have cut these people out of my life years ago, everyone else seems to just accept the treatment as part of life. And the drama these people can start, yeeesh.", "Well, they acknowledged it originally. \n It was mentioned again at the last dinner as they had talked about wanting to share the recipe for this portobello steak(the one they are making,), when I said I wish I could eat that, but my allergy would probably make it disagree with me, and then the conversation just kinda changed.", "This is not the same when bringing the dish into someone else's home.", "Which is why it's not a double standard to have meat in a vegan's home. The only double standard would be if the vegans won't let OP bring their own food since OP has made many accommodations for them and their lifestyle.", "well more of a phrase", "Ok that makes a lot more sense, and I really do feel for you, that complicates everything. Have you addressed the mushroom allergy with them directly? I'm really having trouble getting past that part, food allergies can be fatal.", "Ah, so they are THAT type of vegan", "So they know and continue to do it? NTA. If they don't want you eating meat, they can provide food that is safe.", "You should add this to the original post.\n\nNTA.", "no you can still refuse to eat things in your own home just look at every time a meat eater choses to make vegan food and not partake of it, or when a vegan person brings vegan food to a meat eaters house and the person living there \\*gasp\\* somehow does not eat it.  \nits like not even a difficult concept to understand  \n\n\nlike especially as a vegan choosing not to eat specific foods, just continue being vegan  \n\n\ny'all are just as bad as people shaming those who like well done steak"]}
