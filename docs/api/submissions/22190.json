My younger sister, Sarah, ans my girlfriend have never been super close but are friendly when we get together, or I guess they were. When Sarah was in high school Naomi helped her out with some personal things. Sarah got married a few days ago. \n\nWhen Sarah announced her engagement to the family she asked Naomi to be a bridesmaid, which surprised us a little but Naomi was very excited because she's never gotten to do it before and probably won't have the chance. I want to be clear there was no suggestion from either of us Sarah should ask her, it was about two seconds after she told us she was engaged. She said that she was so grateful to Naomi for the help when she was younger and Naomi was very touched. \n\nA few weeks later Sarah posts her \"bridesmaid proposals brunch\". Naomi wasn't there. Sarah never said it to either of our faces directly but clearly she'd changed her mind. Naomi was hurt but said she understood because she hadn't expected the ask anyway. \n\nThat would have been fine, but then a few months later Sarah asks Naomi to go to the batchelorette party and also come get ready the day of with her friends and bridesmaids. Same thing, Naomi says yes and even helped her find a good place to go and a rental. A month and a half before the wedding I'm talking to my mom on the phone and she mentions that Sarah's at her batchelorette... no mention of it to Naomi. Now I'm kind of pissed because Naomi was clearly very hurt at two invites and then being sort of ghosted. A week before the wedding Naomi texted Sarah and asked about getting ready and hair and makeup, and Sarah responds acting confused and basically tells her nicely to just come with me. Then I was really pissed. \n\nSarah wanted this really expensive baking mixer thing for a long time and I got it for her for her wedding gift. My mom had ruined the surprise so she expected it. But after everything with Naomi I felt like being petty, and I cut her a check instead and returned the mixer. A few days after the wedding Sarah texts me saying \"I don't know how to ask this but what happened to the mixer\". And I responded I didn't know how to ask but what happened to treating my gf like a freaking human being. Now my brother and my new brother in law and my mom are all texting me saying \"wtf\" and that I'm ruining her happy time. Naomi for her part says I probably shouldn't have done that but she feels a little vindicated. \n\nAITA\n\nUPDATE: So I talked to Sasha and things just got more confusing. She said when she asked Naomi to be a bridesmaid she meant an \"honorary\" bridesmaid. She then said for the Bachelorette party Naomi had told her she works most weekends so she didn't think that Naomi was able to attend and was just helping her to plan. Naomi said that she told Sarah to give her dates so she could take off. Naomi is a very non confrontational person and had asked me to not bring up the bridesmaid or Bachelorette things because she didnt't want ro feel like she was \"pushing in\" at the time which is why I didn't. The makeup thing my sister said that Naomi had told her she would do her own hair so she didn't see a reason for her to come get ready with them. My sister is still pissed at me and says I ruined her honeymoon period (she's not on a trip) and some other really crappy stuff so I just hung up on her. She also said that not giving the mixer was rude to her and her husband which is hilarious because my BIL probably figure out how to turn on the oven without neon flashing signs.  \n\nThanks for all the comments I've never seen that many on any reddit post I've ever made in my life.", "created_utc": 1689328827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zc8k7/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_the_wedding_gift/", "score": 14525, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You stood up for your gf against your own family! Bravo!", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister was very, very rude to Naomi, three times.

My guess is that she knew she'd done something to upset you. If she's going to let getting called out on being an A H \"ruin\" her honeymoon - maybe she shouldn't have been an A H.

Your girlfriend expected to be included in the wedding or at least the Bachelorette because she was asked to and then got snubbed.

You responded to her in like kind (although actually better because ANY gift that\u2019s not deliberately meant to insult &/or hurt is better than poor treatment).  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in being \u201cobligated\u201d in some way to include ANYONE - even family - in anything so personal as a wedding party just because they\u2019re family or whatever.  In my opinion, those invitations are significant & should come from the heart or they\u2019re meaningless & trivialize the entire affair.  \n\nBUT - in this case, no one (that we know of) even tried to pressure Sarah into including Naomi - she apparently just did so of her own accord.  When an invitation that personal & significant is issued, it needs to be done with certainly - not with any frivolousness & definitely not while any indecision &/or uncertainty exists regarding whether or not to include someone.  Once such an invitation is given, it should not be rescinded - without cause.  \n\nBy all appearances, Sarah asked Naomi when she wasn\u2019t really sure she even wanted to include her - which was inappropriate & rude at best & deliberately cruel at worst.  So I\u2019m left wondering why Sarah did what she did.  (In other words, did Sarah have cause to revoke her invitation?  Did she learn something or did something happen after she issued the invitation that would give her cause to rescind it?)  \n\nDid Sarah tell you why she did what she did?  Has ANYONE (your mother, brother, BIL, anyone) given any clue as to why she did what she did?  \n\nBecause if they had a good relationship in high school, even if they weren\u2019t personally close, given Naomi\u2019s long term, basically familial status as your (for most intents & purposes common law) wife, it isn\u2019t shocking that Sarah would invite Naomi to be in her wedding party.

I don\u2019t know what was going on with sister, but a lot of the smells like miscommunication, and Naomi making assumptions due to her inexperience with being involved in bridal parties. OP mentions that she\u2019s never gotten to do it before, and I think she read way too in to what was being offered to her in at least two of these instances. \n\nThe first harm I believe is legitimate. Sister over-promised on the bridesmaid thing, invited Naomi, and then probably got pushed back from her family to include a weird cousin or there were some other reason why she can no longer have Naomi. Sister absolutely should have owned up to her mistake, but when she didn\u2019t, that was the time for Naomi/OP to say something.\n\nThe bachelorette party and getting ready in the morning are things that are a little more iffy. I know Naomi was helping her find a rental, but what involvement in Naomi had with the planning after that? Did Naomi communicate with anybody about plans, put down a deposit for her share, communicate about plans to bring snacks/drinks, and so on? Because if the last Naomi did was suggest a rental to Sarah, and nothing else, why did Naomi actually really think she was going? Maybe blame it on what sounds like her inexperience with bachelorette stuff, but there is a lot of communication with all the attendees leading up to any trip, let alone bachelorette trip. Just the logistics alone makes this not make sense why Naomi thought she was going. Does Naomi not work? Wouldn\u2019t she need to know the dates of the bachelorette so she could request time off?\n\nThe getting ready part also can be kind of a tossup. When the bride and bridesmaids are getting professional hair and make up, it is considered a courtesy to ask the mother of the groom and any sisters of the groom whether they would also like to get their hair and makeup done . They have to pay for it, but it is common to ask that. That is not an invitation, though, to hang out with all the bridesmaids, and get ready together the day of the wedding. So if the sister or mother says that they don\u2019t want to get professional hair and make up, then they aren\u2019t there. I really wonder whether Sarah asking Naomi whether she wanted professional hair and make up got interpreted as an invitation to get ready with Sarah like a bridesmaid the day of. \n\nSarah is not entitled to get a KitchenAid mixer.
