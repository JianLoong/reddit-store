She knows you\u2019ve been with this girl 10 years and it sounds like your GF has been treated like crap. \nIt sounds like your mum is also being a bit of a meddler too. \nDid your sister apologise about the uninvite to be bridesmaid? The uninvite to the bachelorette party? Honestly I\u2019m surprise your GF even went to the wedding and you are definitely the better person for giving her any gift at all! \n\nIf your family asks I think it\u2019s needs to be communicated how harshly your GF has been treated and how it\u2019s taking the p*ss to expect a nice gift after disrespecting you and your GF like that. Don\u2019t let them push you over it\u2019s not ok to treat others like that and expect nice gifts afterwards.", "Thank you for standing for the Right. Thank you for being wonderful bf.

Cheers!", "NTA.\nGood for you for standing up for your girlfriend and standing by her when it comes to your family. Sara is a bully, no excuses.

You sure your gf was as nice as you claim?", "NTA. It is your gift and your choice. I am very confused about your sister's motivation on all this though. Does she have a vendetta against your girlfriend and is using the occasion to try to hurt her? Is she very absent-minded and keeps forgetting who she inviting? Is it possible that your girlfriend offended your sister in some way after the invites? I think having an actual talk with her might be a better way to resolve this issue.", "NTA.

There is no absolutely no excuse for that unless it is something on the level of a brain tumor or accidentally taking drugs for months. Your mom and brothers thinking your sister should be protected from the consequences of her actions just b/c she got married is ridiculous. When is the \"Honeymoon phase\" over so that she can be held accountable for being a mean girl again? I bet the answer is never b/c their resonsse is very \"don't rock the boat\".
