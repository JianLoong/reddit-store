At 50, it is going to be **very** hard to find a job (I have seen a lot of people going through this, and starting at mid-40s it is VERY hard). He should be spending all his free time networking, meeting people for coffee, getting informational interviews - just getting more ears on the ground in case they hear of something. I know I don't have to tell you this, but the majority of jobs come from networking at this age, and not from idly sending your resume out online. \n\nI do work, and I have done the networking/going out/contacting people/updating my LinkedIn page/asking to be introduced to people thing before. It is a lot of effort and work, and should take most of the \"work\" day; frankly this car thing sounds like a procrastination step rather than a proactive job step.\n\nWhat if he starts small? What if he can spend, say, $1,000 or $2,500? And did it on weekends? Then see where he is on his job search and if he can fund some more. Otherwise, you'll see him spending that job-hunting time on his car like he's 17 and has all this time and incoming jobs ahead of him.\n\nI'm not sure your husband realizes that job hunting is a long process that you have to motivate yourself for every day; plus we're heading into the holiday season when EVERYBODY is busy and not looking to hire until January, on top of a recession, and the longer he's out of work the harder it gets. Did his old job offer job placement help (office he can go to, career coach?) If not, I strongly suggest finding a local group that helps each other and holds each other accountable. otherwise, you can't believe how easy it is to let a day, then two days, then a week just float by.\n\nGood luck, and don't let his baby \"I need $14,000 or I can't be happy and it's all your fault\" nonsense get traction.", "NAH he is depressed after losing his job, he feels like he has never done anything for himself and he probably feels he has always put himself second to provide for his family, now that he has more time he thought it was a good idea to do something for himself, finacially its not the best time.
