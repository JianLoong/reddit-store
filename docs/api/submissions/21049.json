I didn\u2019t reply, husband sent a heart. \n\nThey are coming to visit later this summer and I know us not having kids will come up, it does, often.

Then he promised he would have kids as a ruse to get you to agree to his proposal. \n\nAnd then the night before the wedding you guys did the whole argument again, with you threatening to jilt him at the altar unless he capitulated and agreed to have kids he clearly didn't want to have.\n\nHis father's off hand comment around the time of  the 2008 financial crash \"I don't know who would want kids in this economy\" has zero bearing on any of this.\n\nBob never wanted kids. You married someone who told you he didn't want kids and then only agreed through gritted teeth right before the wedding, and who then went back on the agreement. All the signs were there that the guy you were marrying didn't want kids. He told you so. \n\nYou marrying him and ending up childless is your fault, and Bob's.  His dad is not to blame for this at all.", "yta... noone to blame except your husband, and maybe even yourself. You should have left or adopted if having kids meant that much to you.", "There's a lot of points in this story that make me pause. Red flags waving from the start.\n\nHowever, I don't think your FIL is the problem. He didn't poison Bob against having kids. Bob never wanted them. It appears that he only said he changed his mind to get you to marry him. And you accepted his lies for all these years. You allowed the narrative that Bob created (your mental health being the reason). \n\nThis all feels like a very unhealthy dynamic from the start, but that's not on your FIL. \n\nSo yeah, ywbta, if you tried to blame him.", "Why in the world did you stay with someone who lied to you so you'd marry them?", "YTA \n\nYour FIL is NOT the reason you don't have kids. You and your husband are. He lied to you so you would marry him and you stayed married to him knowing he lied.", "ESH. The real issue is Bob (and not any offhand comments that other people make.) He waffled and strung you along, not wanting kids himself but kinda acting on the fence to get your much-younger booty into the marriage. But you also needed to be honest (with yourself) much sooner than this. It\u2019s been 14 years of marriage, and surely you haven\u2019t been 25 yrs old and naive this whole time. At this point, If you still want kids at 39, it\u2019s possible (my mom had my youngest sister at 42) but you need to get a new partner fast and be utterly honest with them about the timeline. Sorry Bob was such a weasel. I really don\u2019t understand why you married him if you wanted kids and he was pretty clearly not really on board, unless it was for money or something? Just seems obvious from the engagement and even literal wedding-day debates about this that you weren\u2019t compatible. I really hope it all works out", "YTA. If I took to heart every little comment I heard about not having kids, I\u2019d have - 1,000 kids, not +3.\n\nPeople who want actually kids aren\u2019t dissuaded by one-off meaningless comments. Your problem is that your husband didn\u2019t want them.", "YTA. when you eventually married him (regardless of the ultimatum) and after a while there was still no indication of babies, you should have left.

You were and are old enough to know better.", "YWBTA\n\nYour FIL is not the reason why you don't have kids. Your husband is. Your husband didn't want kids but he wanted to marry you. I'm not saying he lied or deceived you, I think he honestly thought he'd eventually be ok with it. Turns out he wasn't. But again, you have no one but your husband to blame. Your FIL is not the reason you don't have kids.", "NTA. Your husband lied to you about his willingness to have children. Whether or not his father \"poisoned\" your husband on that point is irrelevant. It's still our husband who lied.\n\nIf the topic of children comes up, simply say that your husband did not want any; and be done with it. You don't need to blame his father; it was his decision.\n\nThis post makes me think that you still resent his lie and that you have not made your peace with not having had children. For your sake, I hope that you get some therapy to help you come to terms with your decision to remain with him.", "ESH-\n\nFirst I hope I am not the only one grossed out about the 18 year old and 33 year old.  And that is assuming you were actually 18 when you got together.\n\nYour fil had no right to even talk about you and your spouse having children, it was none of his business.\n\nYour husband likely groomed you AND manipulated you into marriage\n\nYou should have left when you realized he was never going to give you what you wanted", "That\u2019s fair.

A 30yo had no business getting involved with a TEENAGER. Now she is suffering due to his manipulations and control.\n\nOften those dating someone with a significantly younger than them are doing it for several specific reasons. They chose someone so young on purpose. I\u2019m by no means putting the blame on the younger person, I\u2019m just saying that they most likely fit those reasons.\n- someone without the wisdom/experience that tends to come with age won\u2019t see the red flags of their partner\n- someone younger is easier to manipulate and control\u2026 well look at that lied and manipulated you into marriage and continues to manipulate you to stay\n- they want to mold the younger partner into the partner they want them to be - again guess what he did\u2026 molded you into a partner who accepts his lies & excuses and doesn\u2019t protest. \n- someone their age won\u2019t deal with their bs and see the red flags.\n\nConsider this, OP\u2026. You are older than he was when you met, do you really think when you were 30, you\u2019d have wanted to date an 18 yo? Or do you find it creepy?\n\nDon\u2019t use the girls mature faster than boys excuse either, because that is literally the excuse predators and groomers use to explain away why they are with someone so young.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you sacrificed having children for a man who is manipulative and a liar. Sadly you have gotten to an age where pregnancy might be difficult to happen, and this is what Bob wanted. To hold you off on it until it might be too late. His dad\u2019s off hand comment about the economy was shitty timing, he probably thought you were so young and had time to wait, not realizing that Bob didn\u2019t truly want them. His parents making comments about getting old could have probably meant \u201chave kids soon, we\u2019re not getting any younger\u201d. \n\nYou want to blame anyone for not having kids, blame Bob! Kids are not something you compromise on because all it does is build resentment. In all honesty you probably shouldn\u2019t have married him, but his lies led to this.

Don't mess around though this is the time to get on that if it's really what you want. Don't let anyone tell you to freeze now so you can decide later, that is terrible advice at your age. I'm not saying everyone needs to have children but don't spend another 30 years with someone while resenting them the whole time from preventing you from living the life you wanted.", "I\u2019m so glad I posted on here before saying anything. I will absolutely keep my mouth shut about FIL. It is hard because I rotate between feeling like I\u2019m missing out on kids and absolutely loving being child free. My life is my own. I will continue our united\u201cwe don\u2019t want kids\u201d front and get some therapy to process. \n\nI would like to add I may be extra sensitive right now.

That coupled with the story you told about your pre-wedding conversations. He lies to a teenager to get her to marry him and all these years later you seem conditioned to accept his way and blame others. I have resentment for Bob, and you, under his manipulation since you were a child, do not even see how you have been played. In an above comment you say you\u2019ll stick to your united \u201cwe don\u2019t want kids\u201d talking point. But\u2026 it\u2019s not true. Why would you tell ppl WE don\u2019t want kids if you maybe perhaps did? Why sell yourself out like that?! You did want kids and you\u2019ve convinced yourself that the stringing along and lies your husband told you was a thought out joint decision. It wasn\u2019t. Stop lying to yourself and then maybe you can be more authentic with others.", "While I agree she could have left and don\u2019t think she doesn\u2019t take some responsibility for staying. However, what I am saying is he groomed and manipulated her at a vulnerable age. Often when getting involved with someone who uses these tactics they come to believe them to be right because they are older and have more experience. It\u2019s a power dynamic. Also what experiences she\u2019s had since turning 18 which would allow for growth outside this relationship which could help her realize what he was doing.\n\nIt\u2019s not like at 18, and \u201cbecoming an adult\u201d people are granted with relationship knowledge and experience to help them navigate relationships, especially with someone like Bob. \n\nIt\u2019s similar to why people who are physically abused stay. They are manipulated into believing things will change with the lies they are told. What he did was manipulate her by waffling on his decision to have kids. She thought he change his mind. You are right, she chose to stay and now she suffers the consequences of his manipulations.", "I absolutely agree with you that everyone is forgotten, but I thought even without kids my funeral would be more than a blip. I thought I had closer relationships with people than to just be forgotten the minute I\u2019m gone. It just kind of bummed me out and I pointed my resentment at the wrong person. I accept that I am TA for sure.", "I guess I\u2019ve always felt that since I\u2019ve gone with the no kids life I needed to show everyone it was a joint decision.
