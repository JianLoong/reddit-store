I feel especially bad because I really do love my life with him and the freedom of not having kids, I just think I have some fomo when I see people with especially cute babies.

Then he promised he would have kids as a ruse to get you to agree to his proposal. \n\nAnd then the night before the wedding you guys did the whole argument again, with you threatening to jilt him at the altar unless he capitulated and agreed to have kids he clearly didn't want to have.\n\nHis father's off hand comment around the time of  the 2008 financial crash \"I don't know who would want kids in this economy\" has zero bearing on any of this.\n\nBob never wanted kids. You married someone who told you he didn't want kids and then only agreed through gritted teeth right before the wedding, and who then went back on the agreement. All the signs were there that the guy you were marrying didn't want kids. He told you so. \n\nYou marrying him and ending up childless is your fault, and Bob's.

You should have left or adopted if having kids meant that much to you.", "There's a lot of points in this story that make me pause. Red flags waving from the start.\n\nHowever, I don't think your FIL is the problem. He didn't poison Bob against having kids. Bob never wanted them. It appears that he only said he changed his mind to get you to marry him. And you accepted his lies for all these years. You allowed the narrative that Bob created (your mental health being the reason). \n\nThis all feels like a very unhealthy dynamic from the start, but that's not on your FIL. \n\nSo yeah, ywbta, if you tried to blame him.", "Why in the world did you stay with someone who lied to you so you'd marry them?", "YTA \n\nYour FIL is NOT the reason you don't have kids. You and your husband are. He lied to you so you would marry him and you stayed married to him knowing he lied.", "ESH. The real issue is Bob (and not any offhand comments that other people make.) He waffled and strung you along, not wanting kids himself but kinda acting on the fence to get your much-younger booty into the marriage. But you also needed to be honest (with yourself) much sooner than this. It\u2019s been 14 years of marriage, and surely you haven\u2019t been 25 yrs old and naive this whole time. At this point, If you still want kids at 39, it\u2019s possible (my mom had my youngest sister at 42) but you need to get a new partner fast and be utterly honest with them about the timeline. Sorry Bob was such a weasel. I really don\u2019t understand why you married him if you wanted kids and he was pretty clearly not really on board, unless it was for money or something? Just seems obvious from the engagement and even literal wedding-day debates about this that you weren\u2019t compatible. I really hope it all works out", "YTA. If I took to heart every little comment I heard about not having kids, I\u2019d have - 1,000 kids, not +3.\n\nPeople who want actually kids aren\u2019t dissuaded by one-off meaningless comments. Your problem is that your husband didn\u2019t want them.", "YTA. when you eventually married him (regardless of the ultimatum) and after a while there was still no indication of babies, you should have left.

You were and are old enough to know better.", "YWBTA\n\nYour FIL is not the reason why you don't have kids. Your husband is. Your husband didn't want kids but he wanted to marry you. I'm not saying he lied or deceived you, I think he honestly thought he'd eventually be ok with it. Turns out he wasn't. But again, you have no one but your husband to blame. Your FIL is not the reason you don't have kids.", "NTA. Your husband lied to you about his willingness to have children. Whether or not his father \"poisoned\" your husband on that point is irrelevant. It's still our husband who lied.\n\nIf the topic of children comes up, simply say that your husband did not want any; and be done with it. You don't need to blame his father; it was his decision.\n\nThis post makes me think that you still resent his lie and that you have not made your peace with not having had children. For your sake, I hope that you get some therapy to help you come to terms with your decision to remain with him.", "ESH-\n\nFirst I hope I am not the only one grossed out about the 18 year old and 33 year old.  And that is assuming you were actually 18 when you got together.\n\nYour fil had no right to even talk about you and your spouse having children, it was none of his business.\n\nYour husband likely groomed you AND manipulated you into marriage\n\nYou should have left when you realized he was never going to give you what you wanted", "That\u2019s fair.

A 30yo had no business getting involved with a TEENAGER. Now she is suffering due to his manipulations and control.\n\nOften those dating someone with a significantly younger than them are doing it for several specific reasons. They chose someone so young on purpose. I\u2019m by no means putting the blame on the younger person, I\u2019m just saying that they most likely fit those reasons.\n- someone without the wisdom/experience that tends to come with age won\u2019t see the red flags of their partner\n- someone younger is easier to manipulate and control\u2026 well look at that lied and manipulated you into marriage and continues to manipulate you to stay\n- they want to mold the younger partner into the partner they want them to be - again guess what he did\u2026 molded you into a partner who accepts his lies & excuses and doesn\u2019t protest. \n- someone their age won\u2019t deal with their bs and see the red flags.\n\nConsider this, OP\u2026. You are older than he was when you met, do you really think when you were 30, you\u2019d have wanted to date an 18 yo? Or do you find it creepy?\n\nDon\u2019t use the girls mature faster than boys excuse either, because that is literally the excuse predators and groomers use to explain away why they are with someone so young.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you sacrificed having children for a man who is manipulative and a liar. Sadly you have gotten to an age where pregnancy might be difficult to happen, and this is what Bob wanted. To hold you off on it until it might be too late. His dad\u2019s off hand comment about the economy was shitty timing, he probably thought you were so young and had time to wait, not realizing that Bob didn\u2019t truly want them. His parents making comments about getting old could have probably meant \u201chave kids soon, we\u2019re not getting any younger\u201d. \n\nYou want to blame anyone for not having kids, blame Bob! Kids are not something you compromise on because all it does is build resentment. In all honesty you probably shouldn\u2019t have married him, but his lies led to this.

Don't mess around though this is the time to get on that if it's really what you want. Don't let anyone tell you to freeze now so you can decide later, that is terrible advice at your age. I'm not saying everyone needs to have children but don't spend another 30 years with someone while resenting them the whole time from preventing you from living the life you wanted.", "I\u2019m so glad I posted on here before saying anything. I will absolutely keep my mouth shut about FIL. It is hard because I rotate between feeling like I\u2019m missing out on kids and absolutely loving being child free. My life is my own. I will continue our united\u201cwe don\u2019t want kids\u201d front and get some therapy to process. \n\nI would like to add I may be extra sensitive right now.

That coupled with the story you told about your pre-wedding conversations. He lies to a teenager to get her to marry him and all these years later you seem conditioned to accept his way and blame others. I have resentment for Bob, and you, under his manipulation since you were a child, do not even see how you have been played. In an above comment you say you\u2019ll stick to your united \u201cwe don\u2019t want kids\u201d talking point. But\u2026 it\u2019s not true. Why would you tell ppl WE don\u2019t want kids if you maybe perhaps did? Why sell yourself out like that?! You did want kids and you\u2019ve convinced yourself that the stringing along and lies your husband told you was a thought out joint decision. It wasn\u2019t. Stop lying to yourself and then maybe you can be more authentic with others.", "While I agree she could have left and don\u2019t think she doesn\u2019t take some responsibility for staying. However, what I am saying is he groomed and manipulated her at a vulnerable age. Often when getting involved with someone who uses these tactics they come to believe them to be right because they are older and have more experience. It\u2019s a power dynamic. Also what experiences she\u2019s had since turning 18 which would allow for growth outside this relationship which could help her realize what he was doing.\n\nIt\u2019s not like at 18, and \u201cbecoming an adult\u201d people are granted with relationship knowledge and experience to help them navigate relationships, especially with someone like Bob. \n\nIt\u2019s similar to why people who are physically abused stay. They are manipulated into believing things will change with the lies they are told. What he did was manipulate her by waffling on his decision to have kids. She thought he change his mind. You are right, she chose to stay and now she suffers the consequences of his manipulations.", "I absolutely agree with you that everyone is forgotten, but I thought even without kids my funeral would be more than a blip. I thought I had closer relationships with people than to just be forgotten the minute I\u2019m gone. It just kind of bummed me out and I pointed my resentment at the wrong person. I accept that I am TA for sure.", "I guess I\u2019ve always felt that since I\u2019ve gone with the no kids life I needed to show everyone it was a joint decision.

Many people say that only an idiot would have kids in this economy or the way the world is these days, but they don't really mean it and they have kids anyway. Bob does not want kids and he never did. Don't blame FIL for a flippant remark. \n\nIn any case, this is between you and Bob and you don't owe explanations to anyone.", "YWBTA, you don't have children because your husband conned you into marriage  by lying about having kids and you fell for it and continued to fall for it until your near the end of your fertility. It's not FILs fault.", "I'm sorry the new family situation is bringing up the resentment again.  I feel bad for you and your FIL.  What you've missed out on and what he has missed out on.. that hurts, I get it.  \nHas fostering ever been a compromise you and hubby have discussed?  Now that you're older and more established.  It would be a big commitment but fulfilling as well.", "HONEY YOU NEED TO DIVORCE THIS CREEPY MAN THAT ROBBED YOU OF YOUR DREAMS. They should print this story out and use it in schools to teach about predatory older men", "NTA. Don't take the blame for this.", "NTA.  Bob never intended to have children.  He lied to you on the night before your wedding, and he\u2019s been lying ever since.  Bob is the problem, not your FIL.", "NTA - Tell them and serve divorce papers. This isn't what you wanted in life, it's not going to happen with him, and even if you're too old to have kids at this point, do you want to live the rest of your life with the person that held you back?", ">because he\u2019s the one who poisoned my husband against kids.\n\nHoney, your husband played you. This doesn't have anything to do with your FIL.", "I mean yta in this situation. \n\nBut Bob and FIL don't sound like they're too fun at parties either. My guy straight lied to you to get you to marry him... plus he was 30 when you were 18. Legally, an adult, sure. I work with 18 year Olds, though. They're kids. Kids with legal rights, sure. But kids.", "YTA, and this is why wanting vs not wanting children is the dealbreaker of dealbreakers. No matter which side capitulates in the end, one person always ends up miserable and resentful, trapped in a life they didn\u2019t want.\n\nBob doesn\u2019t want kids, and you do\u2014it has always been this way and has nothing to do with your FIL. You two are fundamentally incompatible. If you still want kids, I suggest leaving him sooner rather than later so you both may lead the lives you desire.", "Esh..  FIL made those comments, but your husband was  never onboard with having kids and just used dad's excuses to avoid owning it.  Place the blame where it is due.  On husband for lying and you for wearing blinders \n\nIf you want kids, you deserve to have kids and be a mom.  If your husband doesn't support that, please rethink this marriage that he tricked you into originally anyway....", "Your husband freaking lied to you and manipulated you. Leave him and have kids on your own or with someone else, you claim that you've realized you actually totally enjoy being childless but you clearly don't.", "Your husband is THA and sounds abusive. I would bet there is more under the surface here. OP get out, go to clinic and have the baby you want.", "NTA. If they bring it up you ask your FIL if he wants the litter or the truth repeated out loud. \n\nReally, you are the one that decided not to have kids not him and not your husband. Even at 39 if the parts work you can still have a kid or two or three. \n\nI like that, he\u2019s too old to be a grandfather. So what happens if you had kids immediately do you have to get rid of them when your in-laws\u2019 get old?", "How exactly did you meet your husband", "NTA for thinking of saying tbe truth. \n\nYTA however for staying with a man that didn't have the same goals as you and therefore wasting your life as it is clear as day you still want kids.", "The truth of the answer would be \"Bob didn't want any\"", "Yeah, I don't want my children's father to be somebody who's only having kids to appease me.  I wanted a family, so I married a man who loves me *and* has wanted to be a father his whole life.", "> And then the night before the wedding you guys did the whole argument again, with you threatening to jilt him at the altar unless he capitulated and agreed to have kids he clearly didn't want to have.\n\nHow dare the 18 year old want assurance from her 30 year old groom to be that he wasn't manipulatively lying to her about their future?  How could she have been so immature?!?", "I will check that out, thank you", "He doesn\u2019t even like to help babysit my niece and nephew for an evening. He is overtly anti-baby/kid at this point. I feel terrible for FIL, none of his kids had kids so this is literally like his first grandkid (technically great grandkid).", "Jesus.. I didn\u2019t even do the math. Sounds like OP was groomed.", "Thank you for doing the math!! I suck at math and couldn\u2019t figure it out. Man do I feel bad for OP :-(", "That was the worst part!! He blamed her and now she\u2019s thinking she\u2019ll be the a-hole if she actually tells the truth!!", "She was 25 when they got married. She was groomed (I believe) for 7 years.", "She was 25 when they got married", "Totally! After reading her comments I\u2019m like wow he really took advantage of her and made it seem like she was the issue. He was a predator. You are 30 don\u2019t want any kids. You preyed on an eighteen year old TEEN and then made her sacrifice something she wanted to have in her life. He\u2019s a monster", "Yea Bob is an asshole. Really she should run for the hills still like she should have did when she was 18, but she WBTA if she brought this up now you had all these years to do it. Don\u2019t do it now cause your tired and feeling petty", "I am late 20\u2019s and the thought of getting with an 18 yo makes my skin crawl", "You sound much younger than you claim to be. Your husband is a predator who took advantage of you and continues to do so. He's eroded your personality down to the point where you're not yourself anymore and have given up. \n\nIt's going to take a lot of time to get yourself healthy, and you can't do it if you stay with your husband. It took a long time for you to get this way and it takes time to fix. \n\nYou're going to need a good therapist and divorce lawyer.", "My heart breaks for you that you feel this way. I had my last one at almost 38 and, other than some morning sickness, it was my easiest pregnancy. 39 is not too old if that's what you want.", "I understand feeling that way, but trust me you\u2019re not too old. My mom was 37 when she had me and I have several friends who were early 40s when they had them. Things are so much more advanced medically then they used to be, it would also be a lot safer for you than it would have been decades ago. Don\u2019t give up on kids if that\u2019s what you truly want in your heart.", "Why do you have to present a united front? Why not say your husband didn\u2019t want kids?  He lied to you and  you\u2019ve been covering for him while hurting.  Let him take on the questions!", "Wow...what an incredibly hurtful and ultimately untrue thing to say.  Sure, eventually every one of us will be forgotten.  But, you can still have deep and impactful relationships with other family members (nieces and nephews, cousins, etc.) and friends.  And, I guarantee they will not forget you \"like a blip\".\n\nIt sounds like your mom also has some resentment of her own , but it's not fair to take this out on you.  Just as your FIL shouldn't be the target of your own resentment.", "My mom was a SAHM, us children were well into adulthood when she died and even though it was me doing her eulogy (because I wanted to), her funeral was so full of people that her SIL thought the people outside of the church were just people waiting for public transports LOL. My mom touched so many lives during her time that the fact that she had two kids was honestly meaningless. Your legacy is not linked to offsprings but to what you do during your life. Don\u2019t listen to mean comments, but think really hard if you want to remain child free or not, not because of when you are dead, but because you want to experience motherhood in your life. There\u2019s nothing wrong in wanting or not wanting children, it\u2019s important it\u2019s your choice so you won\u2019t have regrets. Good luck!", "Oi.  I was getting those vibes...\n\nYou are due for some serious self-reflection.  Start therapy if you can, if for no other reason than to guide you through your thoughts and feelings.", "Put the blame where it belongs. Husband for lying and you for wearing blinders", "yes, a barely legal and extremely young in comparison woman is definitely the adult in the relationship with a 30 year old and should be the responsible one", "You\u2019re so smart dude, can I be you?", "Oh god you\u2019ve just wrecked my life! I think I just gave up. I have always felt stuck and dependent and thought it\u2019s not worth the fight. I think I just waited way too long to have this realization. I should\u2019ve joined Reddit sooner lol", "You are getting down voted for a reason dude. Stop saying this everywhere. Doesn\u2019t make it more true.", "Oh my god, I wish I had the balls", "I agree completely. I have an awesome and very close relationship with my niblings. I get to see them all the time so that really helps. I just think her identity has always been \u201cmom\u201d so to her it\u2019s the most important thing because it\u2019s what she did (so it\u2019s the best, if that makes sense).", "I\u2019m sorry, I missed where op has the magical ability to stay 18 and never learn anything and/or where she is kept in a box.", "I made plenty of dum choices, still do, I just acknowledge that it\u2019s my responsibility not anyone\u2019s else\u2019s.", "Um you're 39, not 69. You still have options either with Bob or without him. I'm 38 and in my 2nd trimester. One close friend just had her first at 41, 100% by herself after getting out of an abusive situation where she was \"convinced\" she would be okay without having her own. Another friend had her first at 40 and is trying for her second at 43. \n\nBob groomed and gaslit you repeatedly over the last 14 years. You deserve more.", "i mean, it's not too late to adopt right? live your dream while u still can with or without ur husband, imo.", "I've had friends who didn't have their first kids until they were 40. It's doable.", "Who lie that it's a joint decision when the truth is you were manipulated but a man 10+ yrs older then you?\n\nI'm missing the joint decision part?", "You need to leave him and rediscover yourself and live our the rest of your youth before he sucks it all up. \nHe reminds me of those creepy old men in pop culture who require young bodies to absorb their youth. Like perverted mosquitos. \n\nHe\u2019s a disgusting creep you wasted your most fertile years and if you genuinely want kids, adoption is an option - BUT if you stay with him please don\u2019t adopt a daughter, you will have another Woody Allen situation. \nYou do not want your husband to raise his next wife. \n\nIf I was in your shoes I would be so angry that this gross old man stole my best years.", "Look, my mother had an aunt who got her second child in her late 40's, there was 18 years between her two children.", "Why do you need to show everyone it was a joint decision when he literally lied to your face several times about not wanting kids? You also realize that it's really not too late to have them, right? Maybe you should start thinking about what *you* actually want for your life for once!", "Grow some balls then. You give your husband way too much leeway. He lied to you to make you stay. \nGet some therapy.", "Sigh she was 18 and when they were talking about marriage was groomed for 7 years. Not to mention she was probably financially dependent on him as well. Stop being so obtuse.", "The best of us!", "Or foster! You can be a safe haven for kids that are going through hell.", ">hubby\n\n\ud83e\udd22", "She\u2019s not 18 anymore. She\u2019s not imprisoned.

She can still have kids and she can leave.", "Most places don\u2019t allow fostering after 35. We looked into this.", "Only if shes not with the husband\u2026 we don\u2019t want another Woody Allen.", "Not judging, but honestly, if you are jealous that your FIL has grandkids, then maybe you should really think about (and explore in therapy) whether or not you are truly OK with never having children. You're 39 and could still have a child or two if you really want them. You're husband is really the only AH in this tale since he since he lied about being willing to have children to get you to marry him.", "Most of uz become stronger with age.\nHaving kids is avsolutely meaningful but it also is you pouring your energy into a black hole 24/7 for years . With a man not wanting kids it is very likely you will be the only one doing all the work.\n\nEverybody need to make tgeiriwn desicion. \nI am happily childfree and knew from the age of 11 I do not want kids. I have siblings with kids and am involved with those kids.", "This is not true in the US at least. in fact the majority of foster parents are in the 40-60 age range. It\u2019s actually quite the issue and many FFY are attempting the lobby for upper age limits", "Wow, that seems strange, given how tough it is to find foster parents.  What's the thinking?", "I do wonder if it was for the best because I do really enjoy my life and who knows what it could\u2019ve been like with kids. I\u2019ll definitely explore this with a therapist."]}
