{"id": 5905, "submission_id": "zxv6q7", "title": "AITA for not treating my children the same?", "selftext": "I (51m) have 3 kids: Oldest (30f) from a previous relationship and two more (18f) and (21m) with my now wife. Oldest was three when I broke up with her mother who was ten years older than me. Her mother stalked me, caused problems, and was more than I could handle. I showed up sometimes when Oldest was a kid and even more after I had my youngest children when I felt like I was really ready to be a father. Recently, Oldest said she\u2019s still hurt that my wife and I didn\u2019t allow her to move in with us when she was 14 (her mom had to go abroad for an unknown amount of time). Told my daughter it was up to my wife. My wife said no. So, Oldest moved in with her mom\u2019s ex-husband for her high school years. Oldest was a straight A student. At Uni she had a part-time job but still left school with 60k in debt (I didn't help her with education costs though I'd give her some money now and then if she expressed not having money to eat). I do help my younger children with school costs. My youngest daughter may have to take out student loans, but my wife and I are going to try to cover her education. Oldest doesn\u2019t have a car (she can\u2019t afford one). This past year my wife and I bought cars for our children. They needed them to get to their jobs and classes, and it made our lives easier not having to drive them around. Oldest hasn\u2019t had a car since she was 22. She paid for her first and only car by herself and used it until it broke down. I think she should be fully independent (she\u2019s a 30-year-old adult). I don\u2019t want her to expect financial help from my wife and me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOldest says she feels like I don\u2019t take her feelings seriously. She\u2019s still mad about an old bio of mine where I mentioned having two children and not three which I thought was ridiculous. She was also angry that my youngest daughter didn\u2019t realize they were sisters until the youngest was about ten (youngest thought they were aunt-niece).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I feel pretty satisfied with my relationship with my oldest. I love her. I appreciate our phone calls. When she returns to the state, I make the time to take her out to eat. Recently, Oldest said she doesn't feel loved by me, and while she appreciates our phone calls too, she says I don't feel like a father to her and she wonders if the relationship is more hurtful than loving. I don't know what she wants me to do. I tell her to focus on the present. The past is over. I did my best. I was a young father. I don\u2019t regret anything. I know I don't treat my oldest daughter the same as my youngest children, but they came out of totally different situations. My parents never did much for me as an adult, so my oldest daughter shouldn't expect that from me, and it bothers me that she has those expectations about our relationship. If she just focused on the present, she could appreciate the good relationship we now have. She said I should post on here, and see if she's the one being unreasonable, or: AITA for not exactly treating my children the same?", "created_utc": 1672286781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxv6q7/aita_for_not_treating_my_children_the_same/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your new family meant more to you than her. She needed you and you should be ashamed of yourself. Everything else just piles on the assholeishness. You owe this girl so much. You have repeatedly abandoned her and let her know you love her less than her siblings. You are a terrible father and an asshole.", "YTA. \n\nYour other kids sound like they are adults so why are you still helping them? Why pay for school, cars etc? Shouldn't they be independent? Your parents didn't help you, why are you helping them? \n\nYour DAUGHTER literally had to go live with a former stepfather as a young teenager because your wife decided she wasn't good enough to have in your home. You have gifted her siblings schooling, cars, I am assuming more than an equitable amount of birthday and Christmas gifts, a roof over their heads, love, attention, and on and on. You did none of that for your oldest child. \n\nAnd you were an adult when your daughter was born. The argument of \"I was young\" holds no water.", "YTA, and I honestly cannot imagine why you\u2019re so smug and satisfied with the half-hearted parenting you did and are still doing with your oldest. You think it\u2019s ridiculous she got upset when you didn\u2019t even acknowledge her existence on a bio?? You have consistently throughout the entirety of her life treated your younger children much much better, both emotionally and physically. You\u2019ve provided for them and helped them out, and yet your oldest who somehow managed to do well for herself in high school despite being abandoned by both of her parents is struggling to make it now and is 60K in debt, and you think phone calls and the occasional meal is good enough for her???\n\nI will never understand some of the people on this sub. Like, seriously, I hope you\u2019re a troll. Also I wish your poor oldest had some kind of crowdfunding account. I\u2019d donate right now.", "YTA for not taking her in when she was 14. You actually allowed some ex-stepfather to step up? You let her finances get so bad in college that sometimes she didn't have enough to eat? Aren't you embarrassed? Why should she feel loved by you when you have never done the work? You've done the bare minimum, if that. She's been so sidelined, her own sister didn't know who she was!!!", "Can\u2019t tell is this is real. YTA", "Wow, YTA. That poor girl. \n\nWhat exactly is the reason for not treating this child like your offspring? \n\nThe fact that you dumped her mom and it led to her stalking you? That wasn\u2019t her fault. \n\nShe  got straight A\u2019s and put herself through school in her own.\n\nYou think you did something special by keeping her from starving when she was hungry? That\u2019s literally the bare minimum. Literally. \n\nYou want her to be independent so you won\u2019t help her with a car.\n\nShe is.\n\nIf she\u2019s reading this I hope she does see that this relationship is doing more harm than good. She\u2019s been fine in her own and will continue to be fine. OP has done nothing constructive to be parent in her life. \n\nI\u2019d tell OP to do better, but he doesn\u2019t deserve her.\n\nEdited for length and clarity.", "Yta and it isnt even close. You've never done a single thing to show her she is a priority, never made her feel included.", "YTA\n\nAre you the daughter, writing this from what you think is your dad's perspective? I ask because I can't imagine someone this lacking in empathy and self-awareness to even think of asking others for advice.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter was at least 12 when you decided you were \"ready to be a father\". Enough said before we even address the cascade of AH things you've done since then.", "Your definition and mine of \u201cnot exactly treating the kids the same\u201d are vastly different.  Think about the concept of compounding interest. Every $ invested now (bank, transportation, education) pays off 10x about every 12 years. Your first daughter never got your help with a car/college and will be disadvantaged for the rest of her life as a result. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour current wife is an AH too. \n\nIt seems like all the other comments have already hit the nail on the head.", "You SUCK. Not just as a parent but as a human being. You had/have a responsibility to your daughter. One that you never fulfilled. Instead you just keep coming up with excuses as to why you didn't help her. And in the end, when she rightfully drops your sorry ass and refuses to communicate with you on any level, think back to how you treated her all your life. You'll be whining and regretting to the last, you arrogant prick.\n\nYTA!!!!!", "YTA. Did you read what you wrote? Better yet, can you comprehend what you wrote? I\u2019m surprised she talks to you at all.", "Yeah, this is pretty wild to read. You had a kid, were a terrible dad, treat your new family better and think she should just be over it (even though you still actively do it) because you call her on the phone? Yikes.", "So, so much YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re doing what neglectful and abusive and generally crappy parents do, trying to pretend the past doesn\u2019t matter, that years and years of treating your children badly can just be waved away like none of it counts. If only she would ignore the first 20 years of her life! If she\u2019d just forget what a shitty, shitty parent you were for her childhood and young adult years, everything would be fine and you wouldn\u2019t have to face the fact that you chose to treat her badly.\n\nYou weren\u2019t ready to be a father at 21? Then you should have kept it in your pants or been responsible about birth control. You chose to be a father or, at the very least, to take the chance of being a father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She\u2019s still mad about an old bio of mine where I mentioned having two children and not three which I thought was ridiculous.\n\nRidiculous? You think it\u2019s ridiculous that she\u2019s angry and probably very hurt that you just pretended she didn\u2019t exist? You really think that\u2019s nbd? You didn\u2019t make clear to your youngest that your oldest was her sister? And you don\u2019t even have the decency to feel badly? To apologize? You have no regrets? You can\u2019t think of anything you wish you had done differently with respect to your oldest child? \n\nDid you think that when you divorced your wife, you also divorced your child? You didn\u2019t help her with uni costs except to throw a little money her way when she was in danger of actually going hungry? But you\u2019re happy to help your younger kids? What the hell is wrong with you?   \n\n\nYes, I generally expect competent 30 year olds to be independent, but can you not see that by giving your younger 2 so much more than you gave your oldest at the same age in terms of both attention and material things that you have sent the message that you love her less, that she matters less?", "YTA and treated her like absolute shit. I can see why she thinks this relationship is hurtful. Don't be surprised if she goes NC with you, and I wouldn't blame her for that.\n\nShe couldn't move in with you because your wife said no? She's your child and she was 14. That's an absolute disgusting decision to have made. I would be ashamed to know someone like you who is very clearly favouring their younger 2 children.", "YTA. Everything you described makes it clear you do not really love your first daughter. She would be better off by cutting all contact with you and leaving what is a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship. To be quite frank, you should be ashamed of what you\u2019ve done to her.", ">\u00a0I don't know what she wants me to do.\n\nI don't know, it seems pretty clear to me. YTA", "YTA - Is this real? Are you really that horrible of a dad?", "YTA In fact probably one of the biggest AHs I\u2019ve read in this forum. You are despicable and deplorable. Also your wife is an absolute AH. You deserve whatever karma comes your way. Disgusting.", "YTA\n\nMy wife has a situation almost exactly like you explained. To this day they don\u2019t get along. He still does it to his grandkids of said children.\n\nIf it was genuinely about money, as in you simply didn\u2019t have the means, you could have explained that in great depth considering she\u2019s an adult. But instead just deflected to the \u201cpresent\u201d.\n\nAnd your line about my parents didn\u2019t do XYZ so why should I is such a lame excuse. Maybe you didn\u2019t see it as wrong, but she brought it to your attention and this is how you excuse it. Handing out money is one thing, but I\u2019m sure this is just the tip of the iceberg of things she\u2019s feeling.", "YTA bro you basically threw your oldest to the wolves not cool", "YTA. You were a terrible father. You abandoned in so many ways and wouldn\u2019t stand up for her and no, it wasn\u2019t just up to your wife. You were supposed to be a father.  You choose not to.  She\u2019s going to struggle her whole life because of you. With abandonment issues and insecurities and with finances and a million other little wounds you created when you turned a blind eye. You are a thousand times over TA and she\u2019s watching as you treat two other kids as a real daughter and son that you love and have compassion for wondering why you deal with her like an acquaintance. The past is very much an open wound to her that you can\u2019t look away from  without being heartless. You should be trying way harder, but you\u2019ve really let yourself of the hook. I feel so sad for her. YTA", "YTA. Especially that middle paragraph. It's like she doesn't really exist to you.\n\nAnd you are making so many bullshit excuses for yourself. The past doesn't matter bevause its in the past.

Do know what terrible things can happen to a 14 year old in that position", "YTA - whatever your ex-wife did to you has NOTHING to do with your eldest daughter. The fact that you are fine treating her as less than and not providing for her equally is awful. She\u2019s struggling because she\u2019s had to go without while your younger children have not had those same difficulties.

Being young is the stupidest excuse I've ever heard. While I don't condone teen pregnancies, my mum was 17 when she had me and she did everything she could to raise me and I love my mum. I'm 19 years old and if I had a son or daughter right now, regardless of age, I'd work my damn ass off to provide for them. \n\nKids don't ask to be born, they're made whether they like it or not. You created this human and gave her the shittiest life because of your own incompetence. Age isn't an excuse... Hell even if I was 16 and accidentally knocked a girl up I'd still make an effort. \n\nThe worst part is, she isn't young anymore. She's lived a long time asking \"Does my dad even love me\". And from the sounds of it, she's still dealing with that trauma 30 years later. Good job. Again, not to be that guy, but I'm 19 and even if I somehow had a daughter older than me - I'd still make an effort because she's my *daughter*. People struggle at all ages, and it's just a dick move to just *not* help. Even if my kid was 120 years old and wanted a Happy Meal at McDonalds, they're getting a McDonalds.", "YTA. You treat your first child awfully. It is very true that the children suffer the most when the father no longer loves their mother. You let an ex-husband raise your child when her mother left her alone at 14. The lengths you have gone to not support your daughter in any way is astounding. Please explain what is good about the lack of relationship you have with your oldest daughter. By your own words, you have failed as a father, man and a decent human being.  Again, you have earned TA crown.", "Yta. Are your adult kids now out on their own? You abandoned your daughter since she was 14. You are favoring your new kids way better than your daughter.

Your not taking her when her mother left her alone, your not telling her sister she was part of your family, your paying for your other children\u2019s education and cars, your not acknowledging responsibility for the child you created - however her mother behaved, she bore no responsibility, you did - were truly hurtful and deeply horrible acts. Your behavior to her and mindset about this situation are despicable. It doesn\u2019t matter you were young. You were old enough to have sex and create a child. You did it twice more - and sent this child the message she didn\u2019t matter enough for you.

Leaving her off of your bio. What makes this one so worth throwing back at you is that it didn\u2019t need to appear here. That could have been an apology & a rewrite. But no, you doubled down on PUBLICLY REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR OWN CHILD. \n\nExhibit 3.  Never giving her one single, bloody thing beyond the charity that one might show an acquaintance (money for food), and then turning around and judging her for not being financially independent. Your parents didn\u2019t help you as an adult?

Oldest was three when I broke up with her mother who was ten years older than me. Her mother stalked me, caused problems, and was more than I could handle. I showed up sometimes when Oldest was a kid and even more after I had my youngest children when I felt like I was really ready to be a father. Recently, Oldest said she\u2019s still hurt that my wife and I didn\u2019t allow her to move in with us when she was 14 (her mom had to go abroad for an unknown amount of time). Told my daughter it was up to my wife. My wife said no. So, Oldest moved in with her mom\u2019s ex-husband for her high school years. Oldest was a straight A student. At Uni she had a part-time job but still left school with 60k in debt (I didn't help her with education costs though I'd give her some money now and then if she expressed not having money to eat). I do help my younger children with school costs. My youngest daughter may have to take out student loans, but my wife and I are going to try to cover her education. Oldest doesn\u2019t have a car (she can\u2019t afford one). This past year my wife and I bought cars for our children. They needed them to get to their jobs and classes, and it made our lives easier not having to drive them around. Oldest hasn\u2019t had a car since she was 22. She paid for her first and only car by herself and used it until it broke down. I think she should be fully independent (she\u2019s a 30-year-old adult). I don\u2019t want her to expect financial help from my wife and me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOldest says she feels like I don\u2019t take her feelings seriously. She\u2019s still mad about an old bio of mine where I mentioned having two children and not three which I thought was ridiculous. She was also angry that my youngest daughter didn\u2019t realize they were sisters until the youngest was about ten (youngest thought they were aunt-niece).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I feel pretty satisfied with my relationship with my oldest. I love her. I appreciate our phone calls. When she returns to the state, I make the time to take her out to eat. Recently, Oldest said she doesn't feel loved by me, and while she appreciates our phone calls too, she says I don't feel like a father to her and she wonders if the relationship is more hurtful than loving. I don't know what she wants me to do. I tell her to focus on the present. The past is over. I did my best. I was a young father. I don\u2019t regret anything. I know I don't treat my oldest daughter the same as my youngest children, but they came out of totally different situations. My parents never did much for me as an adult, so my oldest daughter shouldn't expect that from me, and it bothers me that she has those expectations about our relationship. If she just focused on the present, she could appreciate the good relationship we now have. She said I should post on here, and see if she's the one being unreasonable, or: AITA for not exactly treating my children the same?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And now she\u2019s 30 and wants you to step up and show her you really are her father by more then just DNA and you \u201cthink she should be independent\u201d even though your other adult children who had a much better start to life, thanks to having an actual father around, are still being supported by you into adult hood?

And may I just add, when I was over 30 I lost my job and had a very difficult time mentally and financially.

He and my mum paid for my education abroad before that and when my student job couldn't cover all my expenses, they were there for me, ALWAYS! Even though they didn't have a lot of money themselves. My dad even told me once he would be angry if I DIDN'T tell him I had difficulties of any kind. That's a father. \n\nOP is, well... I honestly can't find a proper word to describe him. It hurts me for his oldest daughter how he treated her.

It doesn't matter how old your child is, they are still your child who didn't choose to be born, you and your ex decided that. Would you help a friend in need or tell them they are old enough to help themselves? You gave your other children everything and that poor girl NOTHING but coldness.
