It\u2019s often a large amount of money, people may not be able to get the time off work, people may not be able to face flying, people may have absolutely no interest in flying and staying in the destination you choose with a bunch of people they don\u2019t know well or don\u2019t like or family that are hard work. Whether your friend or family, no one should ever feel like an asshole for saying they can\u2019t make it, ultimately it\u2019s a big ask and anyone who try\u2019s to make people feel shitty for saying no are the only assholes. \n\nNTA - your sister is welcome to feel disappointed but she made her choice and needs to understand there are consequences to that choice. Unless she\u2019s willing to pay for you then she really has no place guilting you. It\u2019s a lot of money and your reasons are fair.

If you can\u2019t afford it there\u2019s not really much you can do here.", "NTA Emily made it about money when she chose this as her wedding location.

They rented a large Airbnb for their guests so that nobody had to cover the cost for accommodation, rented a large suv for picking up from airport and arranged transportation to the wedding venue only had to pay for the flights and eating out.  To me this is the only acceptable way to plan a destination wedding unless you just don\u2019t care if people attend or not, expecting people to come on their own dime, pay for expensive wedding events, food, gifts, hotels, etc is just rude and inappropriate in today\u2019s economy.

Pay check to paycheck living is no joke.", "NTA about the financial part. The drama part is easy, don't talk.

I mean, I typically agree with the bride when she is defending herself against a bossy mother in law, or something like that, but \"her day\" should mean that she gets to control the planning for her own wedding.

I was the only member of my side of the family to attend.  My cousin understood since she chose the venue.\n\nBut people choose those venues, especially in Mexico from Texas where I am from, because they are actually significantly cheaper, for the bride and groom, than getting married in even modest venues here in the state.\n\nHere they also have to cater, expensive floral arrangements, rent equipment.  Where a resort in Mexico will provide all of that for a tiny fraction of the cost.  Why?  Because they profit off your guests.\n\nMy cousin comes from a family of five where their mother regularly emptied accounts and maxed credit over the decades with her on and off gambling problems.  So despite my uncles lucrative career, because of this they cannot afford to finance a lavish wedding and my cousin\u2019s new husband\u2019s family isn\u2019t in any better a position.  \n\n_So I would say your sister chose this venue precisely because they have so little to put into their wedding and she wants it to be as good as possible with what they have.

I don't need any context to call you the asshole here.  Drama that comes from you attending your sisters wedding?  How is that less drama than telling your sister you aren't attending a wedding due to potential family drama.  If my best friend, who has basically been a brother to me for 18 years, told me he can't come because it would cause drama, then that is going to cause a lot of drama between us and he'd be lucky to see me much in the future before he finds a way to make that up to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut obviously finances need to be considered.

Not to mention the cost to us to host that many people at a wedding in Canada would likely put our wedding costs to like $30000+ (average for Canada).\n\nBut, while we haven't talked about it, the cost of a wedding over there would be around $5000-$6000.  and the only people from Canada that absolutely have to be there are my best friend (and his girlfriend), and her best friend.  So for all 5 of us, the round trip air fare, plus wedding costs, plus everything else, would still likely save us at least $10000 from the total cost and we can just put that towards a honeymoon while we are already in a cheaper part of the world.  \n\nUnfortunately we haven't talked about this yet since I haven't even proposed yet, but since our friends aren't as well off financially and it would be cheaper for us to get married closer to her family, I am going to suggest we just fly out the important people.
