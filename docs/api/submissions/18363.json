After about a week, I deemed it clean, and went out to my boyfriend\u2019s. After my first night, my Dad texted in our groupchat between me, him, and Helen, asking when I was coming home.

Says Helen is on his ass, calling me disrespectful, rude, ungrateful. He understood where I was coming from, and said all I did was answer her question and ask a question. He mentioned she was drunk (which she\u2019s been a lot lately). I had problems with her going in my room while I\u2019m not home, she had messed up my altar and taken down some of my tapestries before, so I was pretty upset to know she was in there. A few days later, Dad and I got a chance to talk alone.\n\n\n\nHe said that Helen was threatening to kick me out, she told him to give me 30 days to pack up and go. She felt so enraged and disrespected that she was ready to kick me out, but couldn\u2019t even come talk to me? Dad offered to help me get my own place, but I can\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m getting pushed out.

You can keep in messy if you want as long as the home isn't being damaged. (edit: and she should not enter it)\n\nIt's awfully childish of her not to be able to speak to you directly, but maybe it's for the best considering her demands can be unreasonable. But she sounds like she's making no effort to get along with you and only wants you gone. Ask your father if he's really okay with this.\n\nIf she's been getting drunk a lot lately, it's possible their relationship is on the rocks and she's acting out against you in the general tension. Again, talk to your father.", "NTA. I'm sorry, I've basically been in a similar situation. Except my Dad's GF made it very clear from the start that she didn't like me. She would flat out ignore me and then send my Dad to complain about absolutely everything I did. Bearing in mind this was my Dad's house that she moved into, I paid rent, she didn't contribute financially at all. \n\nThe biggest issue was apparently if I was cooking when she wanted to, so I had to change times I cooked to accommodate her (we never had family meals because she didn't want me in the same room as them) she would flip out and send my dad to scold me if I didn't clean dishes the second I finished cooking, I wasn't allowed to leave a pot of pan uncleaned while I ate, so I started eating my meals cold so I could clean first. \n\nAnyhow. In the whole situation I was angry at my Dad. He often disagreed with her (like your Dad seems to do) but rather than tell her, he would tell me the issue, tell me he didn't agree, tell me to do what she said anyhow, for an \"easy life\" \n\nIf I pushed back and asked him to vocalise his disagreement with her, he would get mad at me. \n\nUltimately in the end I decided it would be easier to move out. The girlfriend is now nicer to me, but honestly I have next to no relationship with him anymore, which sucks, but he chose what he chose.", "NTA - she needs to learn her place that she\u2019s your dad\u2019s wife and not your mother.", "NTA. You pay rent. That\u2019s your space.", "NTA. Why is your dad picking some woman over his own child? WTF?", "NTA\n\nBut I do think it's a bit odd how you're all approaching things. Maybe Helen doesn't approach you directly because normally advice is for step parents to defer to biological parents and she wanted to respect that. Which I don't think is unreasonable. But then the one time she directly speaks to you about your room, you kind of got a bit snarky. So I'm not sure what you want.\n\nI said NTA though because she shouldn't be wishing to kick you out over this, so she's definitely worse. But I do think you should reflect on your approach. Plus it's a bit much to turn it into a 'personal space' thing, when it's not hard to see the state of a room when passing by. There's no proof of snooping or anything like that.\n\nBut that's just my two cents and I'll sure it won't be popular. But if you want actual constructive views rather than everyone telling you you're right, that's mine.", "NTA you pay rent . She was looking for a reason to get rid of you, but it\u2019s a toxic environment so you are better off somewhere else", "NTA", "Yet another post of a dad choosing his new squeeze over his child. Great. NTA", "NTA - This is 100% your dad\u2019s fault. He chose a woman who hates his kid and is now going along with whatever she says. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA.

OP needs to get her in place.", "YTA.\n\nGiven your age and the length of their relationship you\u2019d have been about 16 when they got together. I think common wisdom for a step parent with kids that age is to let the bio parent deal with any issues so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that she goes through your dad.\n\nAnd yeah, it\u2019s your room but it\u2019s their house which mean your choices have consequences to them. If your room took several days to clean without vacuuming or doing the laundry it was probably in pretty bad shape. My kids rooms get pretty bad but it doesn\u2019t take that long to clean them including vacuuming. \n\nThen, despite all your complaining that she always goes through your dad, when she does ask you directly you snapped at her.", "NTA \n\nYou pay rent and entitled to privacy. On your way home, pick u p a lock for your door.", "Idk\u2026 it\u2019s a bit in the middle for me. You\u2019re an adult living at home with your parents, in their home. You don\u2019t get the full adult-privilege of 100% privacy then. I would never be okay with someone telling me I can\u2019t go into a room in my house that I paid for.", "Tbf, she didn't have to go inside to see if it's clean. Your answer had so much sass I could see why she thinks you hate her. However, she doesnt act like an adult if she can't talk directly to another adult living with her. Do you think her unreasonable behaviour has something to do with you being NB? Or simply usually stepmom hating on husband's kids from the previously marriage? Either way, i'd take on Your father's offer, I wouldnt want to stay under one roof with someone who has alcohol problems and hates me. For your own safety. NTA.", "YTA. Seriously your room is such a mess. that it takes a week to clean? If you want to live like that get your own place. \n\nYour right to privacy pretty much evaporated when you can\u2019t even keep your room clean. \n\nHelen talks to your dad because she\u2019s in the awkward position of you living in her house - but you are not her kid. \n\nYou are being pushed out - but you are an adult who is not pulling your weight around the house. It\u2019s time for you to get your own share house and fight things out with a flatmate.  The whole stepparent part is irrelevant. You can\u2019t keep your room clean - then time to be responsible to only yourself and get your own place. \n\nAnd I say this kicking around online instead of cleaning my house - but it\u2019s my place, so unless there\u2019s a routine inspection it can be as untidy as I\u2019m happy in.", "ESH - You don\u2019t know Helen went into your room at all. It\u2019s perfectly possible to just stick her head around the door and see if it had been done or not.\n\nDespite saying your room wasn\u2019t that horrid, you\u2019ve manage to take over a week to clean it, and you still have to hoover and do the laundry, so it must have been in a pretty terrible state to take that long given that you haven\u2019t even done two of the main parts of the chore.\n\nExcessively dirty rooms can cause hygiene issues for the house as a whole, keeping rooms clean is a basic adult task and it shouldn\u2019t need to take over a week to do it.\n\nYou also seem to lack any empathy for Helen. If she\u2019s thinking you hate her and started drinking, it sounds like she is in a bad place at the moment. Have either you or your Dad spoken to her and tried to find out what\u2019s wrong with her?", "Paying some rent doesn't mean it's okay to trash someone's new home.", "Probably not. She likely pays board not rent. She\u2019s also living with her father - not a landlord.", "This!! It's what my Dad did with a girlfriend who put us in a very similar situation that OP is in. \nMy Dad would tell me what she was unhappy with, say he didn't agree, but insist I just do as she wanted for an \"easy life\", rather than stick up for me and tell her he didn't agree. \n\nWell they are still together. I moved out and I have next to no relationship with him, so I guess he's got that easy life he wanted.", "What?! He remarried. What\u2019s that got to do w his kid? Dad is caught in the middle of essentially two roommates and a wife who has poor emotional maturity when it comes to confrontation, which is tough when it\u2019s w your partner\u2019s kid. Dad isn\u2019t trying to take sides. Reddit has a weird zero notion of relationships.", "Agreed, the family needs some space from Helen while she sorts out her drinking issue and why she can't communicate clearly.", "I don't disagree with what you're saying, but it doesn't really apply to OP since he pays rent. They are paying to live there and should get tenant rights.", "Yeah I think this is an ESH. This is a family relationship, not a true landlord/tenant (plus when you have a live in landlord your rights look very different). OP absolutely has a right to privacy but not even sticking your head around the door of your stepchild's room seems a lot. \n\nFurthermore, how bad was it that it needed a whole week to clean up and OP still hadn't vacuumed and done the laundry. My house is a bombsite right now but I could get the whole thing spotless in three or four hours, including laundry. Vacuuming would seem to be a fundamental. \n\nMess does cause issues for the rest of the house, it's not unreasonable for the owners to want to know there isn't any risk of attracting vermin, or that they don't have to hunt down all the crap that might have disappeared into OP's bedroom. \n\nAs for the not coming directly, this is one that needs to be hashed out as a family. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think if OP wants a room that no one is allowed to even open the door of and wants to keep as they want, then they need to move out and get their own place or one with respectful roommates - again noting that in a lot of places a live in landlord fundamentally changes your rights and not in your favour.", "Not her parents. Her father and his wife. In this case, it is different.\n\nOP is paying rent, which means they have certain rights. Privacy being one of them.\n\nHonestly, I don't think you read the full comment. As your post is only superficially relevant to this discussion.", "Paying rent isn\u2019t paying a couple hundred for a room. Op is helping contribute to a home they live in, that doesn\u2019t give her all 100% rights to that room. It\u2019s still their home. Many stepchildren (myself included) would consider their stepPARENT their parent. If they don\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine.", "So you would be ok with a landlord making impromptu inspections then? OP pays for their room, therefore the owners are landlords and need to respect their tenant's right to privacy.", "Rent is any amount paid in exchange for temporary access", "Depends on local laws. That\u2019s not the case here - there\u2019sa legal difference between board and rent. And substantially different legal rights to whole occupancy and shared living. Living with family is also seen differently than living with friends. \n\nThere\u2019s also a practical difference - if you aren\u2019t willing to put up with the family dynamics of living at home - you pay retail rates and live elsewhere."]}
