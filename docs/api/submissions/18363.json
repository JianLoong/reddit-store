But she sounds like she's making no effort to get along with you and only wants you gone.

She would flat out ignore me and then send my Dad to complain about absolutely everything I did. Bearing in mind this was my Dad's house that she moved into, I paid rent, she didn't contribute financially at all. \n\nThe biggest issue was apparently if I was cooking when she wanted to, so I had to change times I cooked to accommodate her (we never had family meals because she didn't want me in the same room as them) she would flip out and send my dad to scold me if I didn't clean dishes the second I finished cooking, I wasn't allowed to leave a pot of pan uncleaned while I ate, so I started eating my meals cold so I could clean first. \n\nAnyhow. In the whole situation I was angry at my Dad. He often disagreed with her (like your Dad seems to do) but rather than tell her, he would tell me the issue, tell me he didn't agree, tell me to do what she said anyhow, for an \"easy life\" \n\nIf I pushed back and asked him to vocalise his disagreement with her, he would get mad at me. \n\nUltimately in the end I decided it would be easier to move out.

Maybe Helen doesn't approach you directly because normally advice is for step parents to defer to biological parents and she wanted to respect that. Which I don't think is unreasonable. But then the one time she directly speaks to you about your room, you kind of got a bit snarky. So I'm not sure what you want.\n\nI said NTA though because she shouldn't be wishing to kick you out over this, so she's definitely worse. But I do think you should reflect on your approach. Plus it's a bit much to turn it into a 'personal space' thing, when it's not hard to see the state of a room when passing by. There's no proof of snooping or anything like that.\n\nBut that's just my two cents and I'll sure it won't be popular.

If your room took several days to clean without vacuuming or doing the laundry it was probably in pretty bad shape.

They are paying to live there and should get tenant rights.", "Yeah I think this is an ESH. This is a family relationship, not a true landlord/tenant (plus when you have a live in landlord your rights look very different). OP absolutely has a right to privacy but not even sticking your head around the door of your stepchild's room seems a lot. \n\nFurthermore, how bad was it that it needed a whole week to clean up and OP still hadn't vacuumed and done the laundry. My house is a bombsite right now but I could get the whole thing spotless in three or four hours, including laundry. Vacuuming would seem to be a fundamental. \n\nMess does cause issues for the rest of the house, it's not unreasonable for the owners to want to know there isn't any risk of attracting vermin, or that they don't have to hunt down all the crap that might have disappeared into OP's bedroom. \n\nAs for the not coming directly, this is one that needs to be hashed out as a family. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think if OP wants a room that no one is allowed to even open the door of and wants to keep as they want, then they need to move out and get their own place or one with respectful roommates - again noting that in a lot of places a live in landlord fundamentally changes your rights and not in your favour.", "Not her parents.

Your family dynamic seems a little toxic. More open communication between all of you might help. It's difficult for everyone to have adult children still living at home.

NTA but you should move out and stay in touch with your dad.", "NTA, your dad isn't really being straight. Yes, he's talking to you, telling you what Helen is saying, then he's telling you his opinion, but what he's really doing is trying to be the good guy on both sides. His spine is made of marshmallow. He's allowing his (drunk) wife to bully you, and he's chosen her over you by allowing her to decide you have to move. \nTell your dad that you know he's picking her over you and move. Then, spend some time out of contact to give yourself some space and for him to live with his choices. \n\nThis from a mom, if it takes you more than a day to clean your room.... yikes!", "Sad situation. Sounds like Helen has problems which are likely to be your Dad\u2019s problems sooner rather than later. It may be best to get out of there early, you\u2019ll dodge the bullet of being further entangled in their problems, and Helen can feel vindicated. I don\u2019t usually advocate being deceitful, but if your Dad is offering you support, maintain your relationship; I reckon he may need your shoulder to cry on later?", "You pay rent and have a right to privacy. On your way home, pick a lock for your door.", "Yeah, I understand you don\u2019t want to leave and you want to still live with your dad, but things will probably only get worse from here. You need to think about your mental health and having a safe space, from which you can later watch their relationship fall apart once you\u2019re gone and she no longer can use you as an excuse for her unpleasant behavior. Don\u2019t talk crap about her to your dad and stay polite to her; you need to do zero work to break them up, and even if she\u2019s unpleasant and the result of the break up would be good I\u2019m sure your dad would probably not be too thankful of your efforts. No, just stand back and stay on the moral high ground - their relationship is on shaky ground so you likely won\u2019t have long to wait. Also, if you\u2019ve got your own apartment your dad has someplace to seek refuge from the drunken unreasonableness\n\nGood luck! NTA", "I agree completely. take the money and run!", "Yeah. Sounds like an excuse to pick a fight", "I don\u2019t know of any room that takes a week to clean. It must have been pretty bad. Stepmother does not sound great though.", "This is a strong possibility.  I wonder if half of the stepmom\u2019s issues are really the dad\u2019s, and he\u2019s just like \u201coh Helen said\u2026\u201d when it\u2019s really him.", "His kid* OP is nonbinary, so not a man or a woman, which is why they said \"19NB\"", "Found the stepmother", "Op pays rent, op is an adult, ops dads girlfriend has no right to go through ops things. Op PAYS to live there. \n\nThis isn\u2019t on op here.", "What specifically makes you think OP was trashing the home?", "Who trashed what? I think you replied to the wrong post my friend.", "How would she know if she didn\u2019t open the door herself and invite herself into her stepkid\u2019s space? Also what did she do to trash it? It\u2019s messy sure, but OP cleaned her room. She\u2019s busy life happens and it seems like a pretty toxic environment will be wearing her down. It\u2019s bound to get dirty, but it\u2019s again a space that OP pays for. There\u2019s not permanent damage. I have no clue where you got this idea homeboy", "His kid isn\u2019t a roommate. His wife isn\u2019t a roommate. It\u2019s a family. The dad is a spineless coward who is letting his new wife bully his barely adult child.", "True, you have zero notion on relationships redditer. You don't know what you say. He chose his wife over his daughter. Calling a child 'roommate' proves it, you have no children either.", "Roommates don't go into each other's rooms and demand they be cleaned. If that's the approach you're taking, stepmom is still in the wrong.", "Drunkenness is never unable to find \u201creasons\u201d to start a fight", "They", "They, not she. (They could be either assigned male at birth or assigned female at birth. You don\u2019t know which, and neither is actually relevant when they\u2019ve said they don\u2019t apply the gender binary to themselves).\n\nAnd the minute they started paying rent their relationship with the house changed.", "OP also lives with their parents.\n\nIt also never says the step mom went through their stuff. You can open a door a crack and see that a room is not clean. Maybe she didn\u2019t even do that, maybe she took a wild guess that it wasn\u2019t done.\n\nEdit: correcting pronouns", "Their father* but yes", "Stepchild, since OP identifies as NB", "Thanks!"]}
