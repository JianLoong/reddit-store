But she sounds like she's making no effort to get along with you and only wants you gone.

She would flat out ignore me and then send my Dad to complain about absolutely everything I did. Bearing in mind this was my Dad's house that she moved into, I paid rent, she didn't contribute financially at all. \n\nThe biggest issue was apparently if I was cooking when she wanted to, so I had to change times I cooked to accommodate her (we never had family meals because she didn't want me in the same room as them) she would flip out and send my dad to scold me if I didn't clean dishes the second I finished cooking, I wasn't allowed to leave a pot of pan uncleaned while I ate, so I started eating my meals cold so I could clean first. \n\nAnyhow. In the whole situation I was angry at my Dad.

But then the one time she directly speaks to you about your room, you kind of got a bit snarky. So I'm not sure what you want.\n\nI said NTA though because she shouldn't be wishing to kick you out over this, so she's definitely worse. But I do think you should reflect on your approach. Plus it's a bit much to turn it into a 'personal space' thing, when it's not hard to see the state of a room when passing by. There's no proof of snooping or anything like that.\n\nBut that's just my two cents and I'll sure it won't be popular.

If your room took several days to clean without vacuuming or doing the laundry it was probably in pretty bad shape.

They are paying to live there and should get tenant rights.", "Yeah I think this is an ESH. This is a family relationship, not a true landlord/tenant (plus when you have a live in landlord your rights look very different). OP absolutely has a right to privacy but not even sticking your head around the door of your stepchild's room seems a lot. \n\nFurthermore, how bad was it that it needed a whole week to clean up and OP still hadn't vacuumed and done the laundry. My house is a bombsite right now but I could get the whole thing spotless in three or four hours, including laundry. Vacuuming would seem to be a fundamental. \n\nMess does cause issues for the rest of the house, it's not unreasonable for the owners to want to know there isn't any risk of attracting vermin, or that they don't have to hunt down all the crap that might have disappeared into OP's bedroom. \n\nAs for the not coming directly, this is one that needs to be hashed out as a family. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think if OP wants a room that no one is allowed to even open the door of and wants to keep as they want, then they need to move out and get their own place or one with respectful roommates - again noting that in a lot of places a live in landlord fundamentally changes your rights and not in your favour.", "Not her parents.

Your family dynamic seems a little toxic. More open communication between all of you might help. It's difficult for everyone to have adult children still living at home.

Helen is showing her true colors and this doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with you, you\u2019re just her excuse for being an ass. She\u2019s drinking more and becoming more contentious. If you move out I predict that your dad will begin to bear the brunt of her behavior much more directly. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't know how dirty your room is. Your standards maybe disgusting too. But...\n\nOP it sounds like Helen is jealous that your dad had a life aka you by another woman, before her. She got along with you in the beginning...because she had to in order to get your dad. She got him and kept playing nice. Until they got a house together. Now, she feels that she has full ownership over your dad. So, she can finally get you out of the picture.\n\nBut guess what, if you do move out, she'll probably have issues with you because as your dad's wife she'll still want to control you.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tricky situation, and it won't have good outcomes for anyone involved.

I couldn't tell you which it is, but you have a better perspective than I do.\n\nAlso, ask him how many bedrooms you should be looking for in an apartment. Don't sugar coat it, but don't try to twist the knife. Ask it face to face, DO NOT PUT IT IN A TEXT.", "NTA, also it sounds like your stepmom has some issues to work through on her own.

Because that's my breaking point with houseguests.", "On the one hand, it\u2019s a tumultuous relationship at best. Sounds to me like you\u2019re responsible enough to have a place of your own (or with roommates, whatever you gotta do) and maybe you\u2019ll be happier if you move out. \n\nOn the other hand, you parents are newly-weds(ish) and if you\u2019ve been living with them this long then they really haven\u2019t had any time to themselves as a married couple. Yes they are parents/step-parents and should be able to navigate such relationships more gracefully and patiently, but if you\u2019re able to pay rent and hold a job and do chores with them then maybe you\u2019re ready to do those things on your own and they could use the time to just be married. \n\nYour dad will continue to see her for who she is, but honestly it seems to me like the best way to resolve this is to move out. Yea it hurts and it\u2019ll be stressful to secure your own life, but you\u2019ll be proud when you do it and you\u2019ll be happy knowing you did it yourself. They\u2019ll be happy not having to deal with kids, and it sounds to me like it\u2019s time to move on. \n\nI\u2019ve been in a similar situation and was thankful when my stepdad pressured me to move out. It sucked at first and felt unfair but really it needed to happen and his assholeishness in the process just helped me to hurry it up. I needed to move out and didn\u2019t really realize I had overstayed my welcome, so what seemed like a curse was actually a blessing. Sometimes life will push you into a corner and bully you a bit before you find a desperate and creative solution that you wouldn\u2019t have found otherwise, and all of a sudden you\u2019re headed in a direction you didn\u2019t plan for but ultimately you really needed. Life has a funny way about it. Lean into this one and embrace it and see where you end up.

I'm so sorry you're going through this! Why? Because your father is spineless and he's choosing a relationship with a drunk over a relationship with his child.

If someone doesn\u2019t want to deal with that, it\u2019s not the right relationship or time in my life for that. It\u2019s shitty that Helen was fine with dating a man who had two teenagers right up until the new house. Feels pretty fucked up to me. You\u2019re 19. Still a teen, and you only have a high school diploma I presume? In the post pandemic modern world with the housing crisis what it is, there\u2019s zero chance you are going to be able to earn enough to be fully self supporting at this point in your life. So by kicking your kid this age out, you put them at high risk of having to enmesh with a romantic partner they may not be best suited for, or having them end up in other shady situations to survive. \n\nSo many people in the world are still living in the late 1960\u2019s and think a magic spell enters a 17 year olds brain the night of their 18th birthday and they are now a 100% capable and high functioning adult even if their parents were abusive or neglectful or didn\u2019t teach them anything about being an adult. What\u2019s worse is they encourage the \u201ctough love\u201d approach and boot these kids out believing they will swim rather than sink. They swim right into our youth shelters and into drug dens. It\u2019s ridiculous. Not saying that\u2019s the deal with your dad who is at least offering to help you, but it sounds like Helen was laboring under the delusion that you would have a high enough paying job in an established career the year after high school and could be out of her hair. And you have a neurodivergent condition which directly impacts your planning functions so it was an even more absurd assumption on her part. \n\nAs for asking her why she was in your room, she didn\u2019t just open the door to check for hazards. She has come in a violated your privacy, taken down tapestries and messed with your altar. That\u2019s a lot more than opening the door.
