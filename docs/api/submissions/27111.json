He cheated, but it was my decision to end it. We have one 13 year old daughter (Emma) together. \n\nEmma struggled a lot with the split, she\u2019s always been a bit of a daddy\u2019s girl so him moving out was very difficult for her. He has her one night per week at his request - he\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d to see her more.\n\nEx met his new girlfriend within a few months of us separating. They don\u2019t live together currently. Gf has 4 kids of her own, aged between 3 and 10. He introduced Emma to his Gf approx. 6 months ago. They all seemed to get along fine, everyone was happy. \n\nThe problem is that since then, every single time Emma has contact with her dad, Gf and her kids are present. Emma has no issue with the Gf or the kids in general, she likes them and wouldn\u2019t mind seeing them occasionally but she does find the other children \u201ca bit much sometimes\u201d as she is used to being an only child. They do all activities as a family unit because any one on one time would be unfair on the other kids. On top of this, they all stay at his (2 bedroom) place when Emma is there, meaning 5 kids are sleeping in one bedroom. Emma has complained about a lack of privacy, and expressed frustration at having to \u201cshare\u201d her dad, when she only gets to see him for just a few hours a week.\n\nI tried to discuss this with my Ex and suggested a gradual transition might be better for everyone, because at the moment all he\u2019s doing is damaging his relationship with Emma and breeding resentment long term. He basically said Emma is spoiled, and I\u2019m bitter and jealous because he has a new family now. He says Emma is the problem because she doesn\u2019t engage in their family life and that she needs to learn she can\u2019t have all of his attention. She will have to fit in with his new family eventually, so the sooner she gets used to it the better. My argument is that he sees his daughter one night per week, which means he has 6 free nights to spend with his \u201cnew family\u201d and they\u2019ve been dating 6 months ish, they don\u2019t live together yet so no need to force family time. Plus it\u2019s been less than a year since we split and I think Emma just needs a bit more time to adjust to such a massive life change. \n\nIt\u2019s now at the point where Emma doesn\u2019t want to go to his at all, and to be honest I don\u2019t want to make her. Obviously if her dad was willing to listen to her concerns/consider her feelings then I would encourage her to go but he\u2019s made it clear he\u2019s not going to. We don\u2019t have any formal custody agreement in place but Ex will most definitely blame me if she doesn\u2019t go and I know he\u2019ll say she\u2019s too young to make this decision, it\u2019s my responsibility to ensure she sees him etc. So AITA?", "created_utc": 1695033665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ls137/aita_for_allowing_my_13yo_to_decide_not_to_see/", "score": 2379, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you know him, so you know the best way to deliver the message - maybe boost his ego, saying how much she misses him, he is her hero and she went from continuous contact to 1 shared night a week.\n\nI know a dad like this - he got so focused on his new family that he saw his kid as spoiled and entitled because she wanted quality time with him. Ex wife did what you are doing and the combo led to irreparable damage to the relationship. There are 3 things that went wrong in this situation:\n1) father got preoccupied and couldn't see there are more viewpoints than just his. His new partner managed him better because she tied seeing his new family to boosting his ego (kids really miss you, you are so important to them, if they don't get quality time with you they are missing out, ...)\n2) mother gave in to the kid. Sometimes we all need to do things we don't want to and just because the kid doesn't want to go there, doesn't mean they should get to choose. Kids of married parents don't get to choose to stay away from mom or dad if they do something they don't like. They work through it and for that, proximity is important. Mother should have insisted on contact as much reasonable.\n3) Kid was an only child and used to unlimited access to parent and getting their way most of the time. With a new family dynamic that changed. The kid refused to adapt because what they had before was more convenient for them. If they were more consciously transitioned and taught to adapt, it would have been different.\n\nThing is, in this situation it looks like everyone is trying to do what is most convenient for them: mom, dad, new girlfriend and kid. Even though it might seem like not making her go is the better solution, in the end the kid will lose out the most.

And that's a lot of people (regardless of size) to be crammed into one room. It could be an evacuation concern as well depending on how the room is configured. Yes, if ex and the GF have their relationship last longterm then she would need to be 'comfortable' with the family unit. But it's still new. Anything could happen.

A fair compromise would be no overnights temporarily and he takes her for some exclusive time either before or after hanging out as a group and then returns her home for bedtime. If you already have lawyers involved, please ask them what her options are. It might be an option for her to have her own representative in these discussions who is a neutral third party who's exclusive job is to here her side of things and present them to each of your lawyers and/or judge. But. You need to try to remain the bigger person and impartial. Hear her needs. Help her advocate for what she wants. And try super super hard to not color her judgement either way.

She\u2019s old enough that the communication can come from her. If he declines these things and tells her he\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d that\u2019s on him.\n\nIn other words, when you talk to him, in writing, focus on not making her spend the night somewhere where she has to share a room with 4 kids. She\u2019s a teenager, she deserves privacy. Let him know you\u2019re happy to revisit when you both can be certain she has her own space. Then let her know you\u2019ll never make her sleep somewhere uncomfortable but also have an age appropriate discussion with her about still seeing him occasionally and tell her you\u2019d like her to try to maintain a relationship with him if she\u2019s open to that. So the next step might be her going over there for a meal or to hang out and then you getting her before bedtime. \n\nThis makes it clear to her that you aren\u2019t interfering with their relationship (however he may try to spin it) and sets a precedent for what it might be like when she\u2019s older.\n\nAssuming you live somewhere where she can drive in just a few years, if you can afford a car that\u2019s just in your name, it may be good to plan for that. This stops him from trying to use her as a driver for those other kids and it means she can come and go from her dad\u2019s house on her own time as she wants.\n\nHelp her brainstorm a list of things she can invite her dad to do with her instead if he gets mad that she isn\u2019t coming.

Mom\u2019s happy to come get me if it\u2019s too much to do that and drop-off.\u201d or \u201cDad, I\u2019m not sleeping over. There simply isn\u2019t private space for me.

Be aware child support can sometimes affect benefits; Citizens Advice can tell you more on that if it\u2019s relevant.\n\nOf course, you should talk to a lawyer to get legal advice on custody, etc but you might want to talk to Citizens Advice first just to get an idea of how things work and what you might want to talk about with the lawyer.\n\nAlso, if you haven\u2019t already, may I suggest you send your concerns in an email to Emma\u2019s father? Something polite and calm of course! That way, you can be sure that he knows exactly what her issues are, and it gives him the opportunity to do something about it if he doesn\u2019t, she decides not to see him, and he decides to challenge it, it could be very useful to have a written response from him, which you could use to prove he is dismissing her concerns and forcing her to share a bedroom with these other children.

I have an older brother and I'm female so growing up there was always just the two of us so our house was fairly calm and quiet as we got older and did our own things in our own room however our auntie had 5 kids, 4 boys and a girl we loved our cousins we loved going over for sleepovers but I was always kinda glad to get back home because I just couldn't deal with the chaos and constant noise which is probably how your daughter is feeling having not experienced that until now when she's 13 so she knows how she likes things now she knows her boundaries.

It just feels to her like dad's forgotten her and he's not even trying to make more effort and time for her when she says that, all he has to do is take her out to the cinema or for food or something on her own every now and then and I'm sure she'll feel better because she's getting that alone dad time back.

You get the attention and affection that children developmentally need in order to thrive. All of a sudden that changes and there's a divorce and then a few months after that your dad is in a new relationship and there are other children involved, ones that you like enough but are different from what you're used to as an only child. Your dad makes a sudden 180 in how he acts towards you and tells your other parent that you'll eventually have to \"play nice\" with the other children and this new girlfriend that you barely know but you're also still trying to process not having your dad everyday. Only 4 days a month and within six months that's only 24 times.

Would the way Emma's being treated be considered at least some type of abuse? Neglect maybe? He's neglecting her needs as his child. He's berating the kid to the other parent. What form of abuse would warrant a custody lawyer? Abuse is more than just physical.\n\nWhy would the father need a parental rights lawyer when he isn't doing anything in the best interests of the child? The courts would take side of the other parent to be quite honest. If there is no form of abuse and no parental concerns in regards to the mother, the courts will typically place the kid(s) with their mother unless in extreme circumstances.

If she doesn\u2019t want to be forced into a family situation with his GF and her litter, then that\u2019s her choice. She\u2019s deserves better from him.", "NTA. He\u2019s never going to consider her feelings, he isn\u2019t going to set aside special time to spend with her alone (without the gf). This is how men are. I\u2019m going through the same thing with my ex & my 10 year old. He won\u2019t do shit for her, he won\u2019t spend any time with her. \n\nContact a lawyer & see about arranging a custody case where she can testify to the judge how she feels about her fathers lack of relationship with her. That\u2019s my suggestion but you do what you see as best.", "NTA My mother worked as a caseworker in foster care and custody cases, and 13 is about when their opinions/wants are taken more seriously into account.", "NTA but he may come to regret this not from court side of things but from Emma she will no longer want to stay with him or connect with him", "NTA. Older a kid gets, the more their opinion counts. at 13, her opinion counts a lot.", "NTA: It honestly sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to see her but wants the title of being her dad.", "NTA. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be forced to sleep in the same room as people who are essentially strangers, it doesn\u2019t matter if they are children or not. And why doesn\u2019t your ex want to spend one on one time with his daughter?? Your daughter is old enough to make this decision. I was 14 when I cut my dad out of my life, I knew it was the best choice for me, so I am actually speaking from experience.", "NTA\n\nToo many kids in one bedroom.", "NTA.  \"He basically said Emma is spoiled, and I\u2019m bitter and jealous because he has a new family now. \"  What is with , let's say men here, who leave their wife and child and then when he finds his \"new family\" they expect the first child to be so happy when all those people are forced into her life while trying to dictate the child's feelings?  Sorry to say, he has deserted his first child.  \n\nIt's time to play THE BRADY BUNCH!", "YTA\n\nNot your decision.

See how fast he has to kick her out or get evicted.", "I\u2019ve been in a similar situation, although I think my dad did it without realizing it. It\u2019s not your daughters job to \u201cget used to it\u201d. He should be doing everything to make her comfortable with the transition. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t have time for her, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t want to make time for her. She will be better off without him, and imo it\u2019s good for her to realize that she doesn\u2019t want to do this at this age cause it took me a long time and it damages your mental health and future relationships. Just from personal experience.\n\nNTA, dad is a complete asshole.", "My dad used to do this and I hated it. Every year he had a new relationship and a new family.

You are not the AH.", "Question, what does he drive to hold 7 people including car seats? What danger is he putting her in?", "This is true, though on the flip side of this: If he tried to do so, the courts would speak with Emma and hear that she wants to see her dad but he won't spend more than one day a week with her, where the new girlfriend and kids MUST be included and also that she is being forced to share a bedroom with **FOUR** unrelated children she hasn't known long even though she has asked not to. \n\nNone of what he is doing is appropriate, whereas Emma is telling OP she doesn't want to go to his due to discomfort when there is no binding custodial time, and OP is respecting that.", "Emma is old enough that the court would listen to who she wanted to live with and see.", "You don\u2019t sound like you have much experience with American custody cases.  Courts really don\u2019t like it when kids don\u2019t have a room or have a room that is full of unrelated people (especially if any of them are the opposite sex), in the US.  It\u2019s likely different in other countries where kids having their own room is less common.  5 kids in 1 bedroom with a teenage girl will very reasonably make most family court judges very uncomfortable.\n\nAnd once you hit the age threshold for the state you\u2019re in (which is between 10 and 12 in most places), the opinion of the child is a factor in the \u201cwelfare of the child\u201d analysis, which is how the courts determine who the child goes to and when.  There are many factors that go into that analysis, but big problems with 2 factors is often enough to decide no custody.", "Firstly, trust nothing that comes out of his mouth. \n\nHe is being a selfish dick. \n\nAs others have noted, if you don\u2019t have any formal custody arrangement, your daughter doesn\u2019t have to go to his place. \n\nBe prepared for him to drag you to court though just to mess with you. Lawyer up now.", "Make sure you either record the conversation about family counseling or text it.  Should this go to court you want proof that you were trying to help them have a better relationship not hinder it.", "Are your courts privatized?
