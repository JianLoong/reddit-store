He cheated, but it was my decision to end it. We have one 13 year old daughter (Emma) together. \n\nEmma struggled a lot with the split, she\u2019s always been a bit of a daddy\u2019s girl so him moving out was very difficult for her. He has her one night per week at his request - he\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d to see her more.\n\nEx met his new girlfriend within a few months of us separating. They don\u2019t live together currently. Gf has 4 kids of her own, aged between 3 and 10. He introduced Emma to his Gf approx. 6 months ago. They all seemed to get along fine, everyone was happy. \n\nThe problem is that since then, every single time Emma has contact with her dad, Gf and her kids are present. Emma has no issue with the Gf or the kids in general, she likes them and wouldn\u2019t mind seeing them occasionally but she does find the other children \u201ca bit much sometimes\u201d as she is used to being an only child. They do all activities as a family unit because any one on one time would be unfair on the other kids. On top of this, they all stay at his (2 bedroom) place when Emma is there, meaning 5 kids are sleeping in one bedroom. Emma has complained about a lack of privacy, and expressed frustration at having to \u201cshare\u201d her dad, when she only gets to see him for just a few hours a week.\n\nI tried to discuss this with my Ex and suggested a gradual transition might be better for everyone, because at the moment all he\u2019s doing is damaging his relationship with Emma and breeding resentment long term. He basically said Emma is spoiled, and I\u2019m bitter and jealous because he has a new family now. He says Emma is the problem because she doesn\u2019t engage in their family life and that she needs to learn she can\u2019t have all of his attention. She will have to fit in with his new family eventually, so the sooner she gets used to it the better. My argument is that he sees his daughter one night per week, which means he has 6 free nights to spend with his \u201cnew family\u201d and they\u2019ve been dating 6 months ish, they don\u2019t live together yet so no need to force family time. Plus it\u2019s been less than a year since we split and I think Emma just needs a bit more time to adjust to such a massive life change. \n\nIt\u2019s now at the point where Emma doesn\u2019t want to go to his at all, and to be honest I don\u2019t want to make her. Obviously if her dad was willing to listen to her concerns/consider her feelings then I would encourage her to go but he\u2019s made it clear he\u2019s not going to. We don\u2019t have any formal custody agreement in place but Ex will most definitely blame me if she doesn\u2019t go and I know he\u2019ll say she\u2019s too young to make this decision, it\u2019s my responsibility to ensure she sees him etc. So AITA?", "created_utc": 1695033665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ls137/aita_for_allowing_my_13yo_to_decide_not_to_see/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know of judges who will ask teens for their preference and reasons in custody, but it should be formal to hold water (but I would definitely do the same...because love is above every law).\n\nYou ex on the other hand is a major tool and super AH for making it so hard on his daughter. I understand his need to make everything smooth for his new family, but doing it on the expense oh his first daughter, and shamelessly accusing you for the current situation is an AH move.\n\nI don't know anything about custody decisions in your locations, so you probably want to discuss it with a lawyer, ands see if you have a ground to get full custody - having a two room apartment for 2 adults and 4 kids sounds like a good start.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There were other reasons but for now ill just say that with my dad i had more educational opportunities and more social interaction. In America you can choose who you want to live with at 12. I'm not sure about you or where op lives, but that was what I was told when I chose who I wanted to live with.", "It\u2019s actually worse. I don\u2019t think dad and gf live together, but they are together in dads apartment on his days with daughter. To build a new family\u2026\nDad could easily not spend time with new family on his days with daughter.", "He clearly doesn\u2019t, he even requested to see her just once per week. Spending time with your parent when you don\u2019t want to already sucks; spending time with your parent when neither one of you wants to just hurts.\n\nETA: NTA", "It\u2019s not about age in the uk but two siblings of different sex can not share a room especially once one is a teenager.\n\nWhats worse about this is the gf doesn\u2019t live With him so they deliberately inflict this on his daughter and make it so they always all stay on her day with him.\n\nOp no matter what your husband says he is in the wrong and is causing all this. Ignore him and if he gets abusive with name calling etc. photo all texts and record the calls with a voice app on your phone. Then once you have proof. Also the ones showing you trying to reason with him and fix the issue right at the start. Then block him on everything. If he needs to talk about daughter he\u2019s to give the information to one of your family members so he can\u2019t abuse you.If he does take it to court you have all the proof of why you blocked him and that it was him dismissing and treating your daughter badly. I hope you can get a text or recording of him saying daughter is spoiled and she\u2019s the one ant fault for everything etc.\n\nOP you need to protect your daughter and to raise her in a nurturing environment and that includes teacher her she shouldn\u2019t ever put up with being abused or treated badly by someone she loves. Don\u2019t force her just because you\u2019re worried what a bully say and calls you. It\u2019s clear he is a bad father no matter if he was good before as it seems it was your presence and actions that made that so previously. You need to show her she can trust you to do what\u2019s right for her and protect her. If he does go to court she is old enough to have a say. You can also show he was forcing her to share with different sex children she doesn\u2019t even know, 5 to a room. That any problems he blamed her.", "It\u2019s not that cut and dried.  Different states choose different ages, and between about age 10 and about 15-16, the kid\u2019s opinion is a factor but not the only factor.  In your case, the constant moving around would\u2019ve weighed against your mom, for example, and those 2 factors together were enough.  In OP\u2019s case, the daughter being forced to share a bedroom with 4 unrelated kids will weigh against her ex.", "I grew up hearing that at 12, you can choose which parent you want to live with and if you want to see the other parent. Turns out, it was an urban legend.\n\nThe reality is that until you're 18, if your parents can't agree, a judge will make the decision and might take into consideration the opinion of the teenager. But the reality is also that it's harder to make a teenager go to see someone they don't want to see and that cops are not going to come and get the kid for you everytime it's your custody time.", "But your parents lived in separate states. If the Dad is local and is only asking 1 day a week, will that definitely be denied based on what the kid wants? I'm not a lawyer, but I would assume it's a bit more nuanced than \"At 12, you have 100% say.\" Also, if Dad goes to a lawyer first, would he have a case that he was being denied visitation?\n\n\nOP should also talk to the lawyer about child support in relation to all possible scenarios. \n\n\nAnd, even within the US, I'm sure laws vary by state or jurisdiction.", "Not everywhere in America. In Maryland, kids have NO say even if they are almost 18.", "This is what fascinated me when I arrived in Britain, it's not actually illegal. \n\nIt's not illegal for them to share but it's recommended that they don't. If it was illegal, they would have to provide people with a means to actually deal with it, the housing crisis would make it impossible to make that illegal. \n\n\n\"As kids grow up they might want more privacy and need their own space, especially if they're sharing a bedroom with a brother or sister. While it's not illegal for them to share, it's recommended that children over the age of 10 should have their own bedrooms \u2013 even if they're siblings or step-siblings\"\n\nhttps://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/in-the-home/sharing-a-bedroom/\n\nThere's also no legal youngest age for children to be left alone. It's all on a base by base basis. Just illegal for them to be left at risk.", "That many kids in one room would give me the worst anxiety. 12 was just was I was told. Definitely needs a lawyer tho.", "Well there was nothing my mom could really do to make me go back. I said I don't want to go back and we fought until she agreed. There was no legal court or whatever that she could do. We live in different states so it would have been more expensive for her to travel and my dad would need to be there because I'm under age so two plane tickets to another state is also expensive. And I'm 18 now, so technically she can't force me to do anything anymore. Really it was a crappy situation but I chose where I wanted to be and my mom couldn't really do anything about it.", "Agreed", "That might\u2019ve been the age where the state the custody agreement was made started considering kid\u2019s opinions as part of their inquiry into the welfare of the child; 10 and 12 are the most common ages for state legislation to officially require considering the child\u2019s opinions, though most states don\u2019t have legislation that specifies, they just have case law, which is more flexible and more easily changed.", "Some states are 18, and parents are expected to make their reluctant teens obey."]}
