I had a few shirts and pairs of shorts scattered across our bedroom, so I asked my wife to just throw my clothes in a closet, or bedroom- just somewhere the cat couldn\u2019t get to them. \n\nI come home from work a few hours later and our apartment reeks of cat pee. I go into our bedroom to look at where the car peed on our bed and I see my clothes in a pile in the corner\u2026 and they were wet with cat pee. \n\nI was furious. I asked my wife to put my clothes somewhere where they wouldn\u2019t get peed on. But she just put everything in a corner.

Your wife is not your mother.  Your cat needs to see the vet to be sure that it doesn\u2019t have a UTI or other urinary tract issue.  Get a waterproof cover for the mattress.

It is critical to get the scent out of those items.  Just washing them will not do it.  If the vet rules out a UTI, Prozac is used for inappropriate urination.  If you are unable to pill your cat, it can be made into a transdermal form which is just rubbed on the cats ear.  And, the litter box should be cleaned at least once daily.", "YTA.

If it were the litterbox being dirty, why assume it was OP's turn to clean it? I don't think it's called for to assume fault.\n\nNonetheless if the wife doesn't mind him dropping his clothes on his side of the bed that's fine, but when you do that there's always the chance the cat will throw up on them, something will get spilled on the floor, etc. and it's not unreasonable for your partner to fail to help you with that. It's still good she apologized as she did make a mistake, but mistakes are not asshole material and I don't think it's OK that OP got angry, so I say YTA here.", "Hijacking top comment so hopefully it will be seen. NTA for being upset but there are options out there. 1. It\u2019s expensive as heck but a Literobot saved us. I have a cat that has to have a spotless litter box every time or he won\u2019t use it. With three cats that\u2019s hard to always do. If you can\u2019t afford a Litter Robot right off they do make cheaper versions you can find online that automatically clean the liter box. 2. Make sure your cat is healthy. UTIs can cause a change in behavior. 3. Make sure your cat isn\u2019t bored. Cats are pricks. They will push buttons and do things to upset us when they are bored. Make sure the cat has interactive toys. 4. Get him fixed. It may not be pee. It make be him marking his territory.\n\nEdit: adding one more thing. 5. Did you recently change his litter?

Pick up your own clothes. \n\nYTA.", "Lifelong cat owner here, some advice:\n\nOnce a week is not enough.  Daily is necessary if you have one cat.  Morning and evening if you have two.\n\nConventional liter box wisdom says one for each cat plus one extra.  This gives each cat their own territory plus a neutral box.  Some cats won't poop and pee in the same box, which is another reason for having one more than the number of cats in the house.  If your pet is peeing outside of the box, but pooping in it, you may have one of those.\n\nI know this seems excessive, but this the advice you will get from pet experts or searching online for information.  And honestly, if every time you had to use the bathroom you needed to wade through you and your wife's old turds, you'd probably start peeing elsewhere too.\n\nEven if you don't get the extra boxes, you're going to need to clean *at least* every other day.  Daily, or twice so would be ideal though.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, boxes should be spread out in the home, and placed in multiple rooms.  In my house, they're in the garage (accessible by a cat door), bathroom and basement.  This prevents cats from feeling the need to mark their territory by scratching or other means (spraying if not neutered).\n\nKitty might also be stressed if she's new to the home and there's an existing cat.  This can mean you do everything right and she still pees outside the box.  For this you may want to look into calming treats, plug-in pheromone misters/collars or talk to your vet.  Cats should be introduced to new environments and other animals very slowly and rushing that can result in this sort of behavior.\n\nGood luck!", "Those poor cats. Imagine peeing in a toilet that was only flushed once a week. Boxes should be scooped twice a day, minimum. A third box would be ideal.
