Odette planned to wear great-great grandma Mary's veil, which has a distinct lace pattern and is passed to only the eldest daughter. In our family it's considered good luck, heavily sentimental, and we have multiple bridal pictures of eldest daughters in the veil while standing with their mom and grandma.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe bridal party and family met at Odette's house before driving to the venue. The veil had been in a garment bag, hung up in front of a closet door, but the door had been opened, the hanger fell off, and none of us missed it when we packed up. We made it to the venue by noon for the 4pm wedding. Odette realized the veil was missing and ran to me in a panic, insisting I needed to be the one to go find it: mom wouldn't drive fast enough, middle sister Constance was her MOH, and dad was dealing with setup.  I didn't think I could make it there and back, but Odette insisted and said that if needed we could stall the ceremony a little.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI floored it but sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic for almost two hours, Waze estimating I wouldn't be at her house until at least 2:45pm. I texted Odette that if I didn't turn around *now*, I wasn't going to make it. She texted back \"JUST GET IT HERE.\" When I emphasized that I wouldn't make it for her wedding ceremony or reception if I didn't turn around, she said \"The photographer doesn't leave until 7, just get it here before then so mom, grandma, and I can take pictures.\" I made it to her house on adrenaline, but it took me forever to find the veil and get on the road again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOdette's texts continued after the wedding ceremony and pictures. I was already exhausted, sitting in rush hour traffic, and upset that I'd missed the entire thing. After re-reading our texts they were all about Mary's veil. I realized that she didn't care at all about me being there, which upset me enough to turn around at 5:30pm, with an estimated arrival of 6:30pm and getting later. I texted Odette that I was sorry, but the veil was put up and the house key was in the flower pot. I woke up to a ton of angry texts from her accusing me of ruining her wedding and not trying hard enough to get back.

I cannot imagine having my sibling miss my entire wedding for a veil, even if it is sentimental. She could have easily picked a day after the wedding to recreate some pictures with it, that's what it would have been by the point you got there anyway since she didn't have it all day. She shouldn't have asked you to go in the first place.", "NTA.\n\nDon't worry though. Just make sure to bring the viel to her second wedding cause lord knows if this is how she treats people theres gonna be a divorce.", "Info: To clarify \u2014 you were in traffic at 5:30 on the way back to the wedding venue and then you turned around and went back home and got there at 6:30? I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the final events and times (might just be me)", "NTA, you hit your breaking point. You need to take a step back from your sister though, when you're both calm then you can maybe try and talk it out, but I'd really be reevaluating your place in her life, I know weddings make people crazy but not even remotely caring that your little sister missed your entire wedding is a bridge too far, it's made even worse by the fact that the day after she was still only focused on your failure to bring the veil, not the fact that YOU never made it. You are a much better person than me because I would've given up way sooner honestly, and then given sis a piece of my mind about her priorities.\n\nFrankly her anger about the veil  should be directed towards the MOH, it's their responsibility to make sure everything's good/ready, plus as your sister she knows the importance of the veil and still didn't double check that it was packed.\n\nAny feeling towards you should be guilt/regret for having you miss the ceremony, but don't worry, given her attitude, you can bring the veil to her next wedding.

Truly if this were such a once in a lifetime tradition for the bride, she should have assigned someone to be responsible for the veil. As it was, it was just a series of unfortunate events that became your problem. Don't let it. I've known brides who have taken their wedding photos a week or two after the wedding.

I get that the veil had a very important sentimental value, but I would never never be ok with my sister missing my wedding because of a veil.

Screw that.", "NTA if the veil was so fucking important, she would've assigned someone to hold the damn thing at all times.", "NTA. Too many people have this idealized version of what their wedding will be like, and the truth is that a thousand things can go wrong. The idea of having the fairytale wedding is exactly that, a fairytale. Your sister needs to learn to take things as they come in life, or she's going to be miserable.", "NTA. Wow,  im so sorry you went through that.\n\nDon't be surprised if she turns around and blames you for not getting the veil to her when her marriage falls apart. Please know that it won't be your fault. It'll be because she is a selfish and inconsiderate person.", "NTA Jeez she wasn't even nice about any of this. She cared more about an object than her sibling, probably spent the whole wedding and reception thinking about the dang veil too, which sounds miserable, but she did that to herself.", "NTA if the veil was SO important it would have been checked that it was in the car prior to leaving for a venue that far away.", "NTA - I can understand your reasoning for turning around at that point.   Some people can drive all day.  Some can't.  I do not think that your sister realized or cared that she was asking you to drive more than 9 hours (not including stops) in one day.  That is a big ask, especially in traffic that slows the driving down.\n\nIMO, your sister should have driven closer to the ceremony the day before, and then there would have been time for the last minute \"I forgot this item\" stuff.\n\nNot that it really matters in this situation, but do you and your sister get along well, or is something like this request typical of your sister and how she treats you?

Why did you agree to go get the veil and bring it back if you weren\u2019t going to follow through?\n\nIt seems like bride was clear from the beginning that she was okay with you missing the ceremony - she wanted the veil there at least to get photos.  If you were not okay with this, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it.", "Constance is TA. Isn't it the responsibility of the maid of honor to make sure the wedding party has everything, especially before relocating to a not nearby venue?

Literally one of her most important duties.\n\nYou wouldn't have been as much an AH if you hadn't given up *after* retrieving the veil. You were literally on your way back & would have been there in time for her to at least get the photos. \n\nOf course,  her priorities suck rocks and I seldom support Bridezilla-level demands but very few people are thinking straight *on their wedding day* .  Emotions are running high, everything feels very exaggerated...it's not a good *excuse* for bad behavior but it is a good reason to let shit slide more than you would on another day. \nI understand why you were hurt, angry and frustrated, but I would have let her have this one (and held it over her head forever, because I am not without pettiness)", "NTA, you tried your best despite time is against you.\n\nI'm sorry that your family lacks of empathy and understanding.", "NTA, but your sister sure as hell is.", "NTA!!! My chuppah didn\u2019t work out. Multiple issues, mostly on the part of the venue, and we ended up just saying fuck it and moving on. The chuppah, by the way, is a critical symbolic aspect of the Jewish ceremony as it delineates the home you are making with your spouse. It\u2019s also absolutely jarringly absent from my wedding photos. And it\u2019s extra sad because we had a fantastic specialty chuppah made by a close friend entirely of beautiful twinkly lights, it would\u2019ve been utterly magical. \nNow let me tell you all about how we had an incredible wedding that embodied every Jewish tradition we could muster and felt perfectly suited for us, and I barely even think about the chuppah or the other things that didn\u2019t go perfectly. And no chance in hell I\u2019d have sent anyone, anyone, from our guests to go get a chuppah even if it were infinitely doable. A wedding is a fucking party, it should be tailored for your guests to enjoy themselves while sharing in your happiness. Anything else is a mockery of the institution.", "EFF her and that veil , NTA. You went above and beyond to try to make an impossible task happen. If she cared that much about it she would have made sure she had it before she left the house.

It was obvious you were going to miss the ceremony if you went for the veil so Odette was an ah for asking you to do it and for not caring about your presence as much as the veil.

I can\u2019t believe she asked you to do that.  That was very nice of you to do, and she never should have asked it of you.", "NTA. If the veil was that important she should have specifically assigned someone to make sure it was in the car or done it herself. You tried and she was shitty to you while you were actively trying and it sounds like you very likely weren't going to make it before the photographer left anyway.\n\nAlso, what is this \"first daughter\" shit? Are children who are not born first not worthy of being included in a supposedly treasured family tradition? I'm the oldest of 4 sisters and if my family pulled that I'd have refused to wear it.", "NTA. Sorry that she didn\u2019t get the veil, but it Was unreasonable to expect you to be able to get it back in time.", "Wait, so you could have gotten it there before the photographer left and been the hero, but decided to turn around and go home instead?

I'm sorry you got crapped on, as you're absolutely NTA.", "Oh I see. The venue is 2:15 from the house\u2026 so you were already more than half way to the venue and then you turned around and went home and actually drove a longer time to get home than if you\u2019d just pressed on to the venue? Interesting", "A cousin can be completely trustworthy and they could have made it for photos and probably would be happy to miss the wedding anyway.", "You still have a responsibility to say no or do what you promise to do.", "Not necessisarily. Gridlock usually gets longer that time of day, so she might not have even made it by 7 when the photographer was supposed to leave. She was stuck in traffic all the way there and back, and all her sister was concerned about was the stupid veil, not that her sister missed the entire thing.", "Her sister was more concerned about having the damned veil at her wedding than having her sister at the wedding.", "The point is the OP \"gave up\" because of how SHE felt treated on someone else's wedding day.  \n\nEven if the OP got there too late for the official photographer, she would have still looked like the hero for trying and the bride still could have gotten pictures from someone's cell phone of her in the veil on her wedding day.\n\nInstead, OP decided to make it about her and robbed the bride of the opportunity to get some sort of pictures in the treasured veil.", "Lmao if I had an award to give you for this, I would.", "LOL", "Personally, I would have made my sister a priority. My wedding wouldn\u2019t be the same without her there. In fact, I would be devastated if she wasn\u2019t present. It\u2019s not like the bride sent some random person to go get her veil.", "You really would be okay getting married without your sister there as long as you had good photos of you in costume after the ceremony? A veil you didn\u2019t even actually wear to get married in, so it\u2019s a fake, staged photo?", "Just because it\u2019s your wedding day it\u2019s no excuse for being an asshole.", "Exactly.", "The venue is 2 hours and 15 minutes away if there's no traffic. Traffic was gridlocked, so I sat watching my estimated time get later and later, then turned around and went back against the flow of traffic to get to Odette's house, which didn't take as long.", "You also have the choice to back out of a potentially toxic situation. There are times in life when a plan or promise can't be followed through on due to variables well beyond your control. She went into this whole thing intending to do as she promised, with the bridezilla toxically and frantically requesting a piece of garment adamantly be at present at her wedding without regards to the time or capabilities of the OP then the OP had it within her right to take herself out of the situation. She kept a clear line of open communication, even if the bride didn't care or bother to respect it.", "The bride picked having the veil there over her own sister.\n\nTo recap: the bride insisted that OP leave and drive for hours to go get an item. OP wasn\u2019t even at the house by 2:45, when she realised she\u2019d miss the wedding if she didn\u2019t turn around. The bridge then picked the veil, an inanimate object, over her real life sisters presence. \n\nSo OP gets the veil, and isn\u2019t going to make it in time for the photographer, has been diriving for at least 5 hours round trip at this point, and her sister is still hung up on the veil. So OP says \u201cfuck you\u201d and goes home after an exhausting and upsetting day. \n\nThe sister bit the hand she wanted to feed her here. She showed several times she valued a veil over her sister. OP just decided to value herself instead.", "Ok, that explanation I can agree with.  Thanks for the response.", "Ok. But if it was showing you as an hour out at any point you were (logically) over halfway there, but I get the point about the time and traffic.\n\nIn any event, it\u2019s a tough one. You were already exhausted, going way above and beyond, and getting inconsiderate texts from your sister while doing everything possible to help her\u2026 I\u2019d be pretty angry about that too. You deserved a lot better than how you were treated, that is for sure.\n\nBut boy, turning around after all that is an asshole move even if it is a *highly understandable* one. \n\nI am going to say ESH\u2026 barely so.\n\nAs crappy as your sister was, you could have gotten it there and and let her carry on your family tradition, and then dealt with her behavior after. \n\nI would hope she would have been ashamed of how she acted and given you a big apology and a big thank you\u2026obviously you know her and I don\u2019t so you can asses how likely you think that is (weddings seem to turn even normal people into monsters sometimes). \n\nHonestly tough one to rate though. Could be N T A.\n\nOr put differently\u2026 sometimes being an asshole is justified, even if that is still what it is.", "You have a fair take.  But it wasn't when the bride said just get it here by 7 that she bailed.  It was when she thought about it and got pissed off at it that she bailed.  Honestly, if she would have bailed earlier and turned around then I would respect the decision more than to miss the whole thing and also not bring the veil just feels like a pissed off f off to the bride for something she could have just said no to originally.  \n\nShe should not have agreed to do it.  I take promises more seriously than that.  I would have brought it back and then cut her off if I was offended.  But I probably wouldnt have cared if I were there or not anyway.  I suppose I am the cousin with the lead foot so I will be the dissenting opinion.", "I could better understand the OPs actions if she would have bailed on the wedding party the moment they effectively said they would rather the veil be late to the wedding than the sister be on time for the ceremony.\n\nPast that point, everyone seemed to buy into the idea of sacrificing the sister's attendance for the veil.  From that point, it became something of the classic \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" scenario.  \n\nBut instead, the OP didn't decide to bail until the journey was nearly complete.\n\nBesides, I don't see it being the \"right thing to do\" to intentionally hurt someone just because they hurt you... especially when the bride (and likely under pressure from the rest of the family) likely unintentionally hurt the OP."]}
