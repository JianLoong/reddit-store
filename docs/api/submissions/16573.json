Odette planned to wear great-great grandma Mary's veil, which has a distinct lace pattern and is passed to only the eldest daughter. In our family it's considered good luck, heavily sentimental, and we have multiple bridal pictures of eldest daughters in the veil while standing with their mom and grandma.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe bridal party and family met at Odette's house before driving to the venue. The veil had been in a garment bag, hung up in front of a closet door, but the door had been opened, the hanger fell off, and none of us missed it when we packed up. We made it to the venue by noon for the 4pm wedding. Odette realized the veil was missing and ran to me in a panic, insisting I needed to be the one to go find it: mom wouldn't drive fast enough, middle sister Constance was her MOH, and dad was dealing with setup.  I didn't think I could make it there and back, but Odette insisted and said that if needed we could stall the ceremony a little.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI floored it but sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic for almost two hours, Waze estimating I wouldn't be at her house until at least 2:45pm. I texted Odette that if I didn't turn around *now*, I wasn't going to make it. She texted back \"JUST GET IT HERE.\" When I emphasized that I wouldn't make it for her wedding ceremony or reception if I didn't turn around, she said \"The photographer doesn't leave until 7, just get it here before then so mom, grandma, and I can take pictures.\" I made it to her house on adrenaline, but it took me forever to find the veil and get on the road again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOdette's texts continued after the wedding ceremony and pictures. I was already exhausted, sitting in rush hour traffic, and upset that I'd missed the entire thing. After re-reading our texts they were all about Mary's veil. I realized that she didn't care at all about me being there, which upset me enough to turn around at 5:30pm, with an estimated arrival of 6:30pm and getting later. I texted Odette that I was sorry, but the veil was put up and the house key was in the flower pot. I woke up to a ton of angry texts from her accusing me of ruining her wedding and not trying hard enough to get back.

I cannot imagine having my sibling miss my entire wedding for a veil, even if it is sentimental. She could have easily picked a day after the wedding to recreate some pictures with it, that's what it would have been by the point you got there anyway since she didn't have it all day. She shouldn't have asked you to go in the first place.", "NTA.\n\nDon't worry though. Just make sure to bring the viel to her second wedding cause lord knows if this is how she treats people theres gonna be a divorce.", "Info: To clarify \u2014 you were in traffic at 5:30 on the way back to the wedding venue and then you turned around and went back home and got there at 6:30? I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the final events and times (might just be me)", "NTA, you hit your breaking point. You need to take a step back from your sister though, when you're both calm then you can maybe try and talk it out, but I'd really be reevaluating your place in her life, I know weddings make people crazy but not even remotely caring that your little sister missed your entire wedding is a bridge too far, it's made even worse by the fact that the day after she was still only focused on your failure to bring the veil, not the fact that YOU never made it. You are a much better person than me because I would've given up way sooner honestly, and then given sis a piece of my mind about her priorities.\n\nFrankly her anger about the veil  should be directed towards the MOH, it's their responsibility to make sure everything's good/ready, plus as your sister she knows the importance of the veil and still didn't double check that it was packed.\n\nAny feeling towards you should be guilt/regret for having you miss the ceremony, but don't worry, given her attitude, you can bring the veil to her next wedding.

Truly if this were such a once in a lifetime tradition for the bride, she should have assigned someone to be responsible for the veil. As it was, it was just a series of unfortunate events that became your problem. Don't let it. I've known brides who have taken their wedding photos a week or two after the wedding.

I get that the veil had a very important sentimental value, but I would never never be ok with my sister missing my wedding because of a veil.

Screw that.", "NTA if the veil was so fucking important, she would've assigned someone to hold the damn thing at all times.", "NTA. Too many people have this idealized version of what their wedding will be like, and the truth is that a thousand things can go wrong. The idea of having the fairytale wedding is exactly that, a fairytale. Your sister needs to learn to take things as they come in life, or she's going to be miserable.", "NTA. Wow,  im so sorry you went through that.\n\nDon't be surprised if she turns around and blames you for not getting the veil to her when her marriage falls apart. Please know that it won't be your fault. It'll be because she is a selfish and inconsiderate person.", "NTA Jeez she wasn't even nice about any of this. She cared more about an object than her sibling, probably spent the whole wedding and reception thinking about the dang veil too, which sounds miserable, but she did that to herself.", "NTA if the veil was SO important it would have been checked that it was in the car prior to leaving for a venue that far away.", "NTA - I can understand your reasoning for turning around at that point.   Some people can drive all day.  Some can't.  I do not think that your sister realized or cared that she was asking you to drive more than 9 hours (not including stops) in one day.  That is a big ask, especially in traffic that slows the driving down.\n\nIMO, your sister should have driven closer to the ceremony the day before, and then there would have been time for the last minute \"I forgot this item\" stuff.\n\nNot that it really matters in this situation, but do you and your sister get along well, or is something like this request typical of your sister and how she treats you?

Why did you agree to go get the veil and bring it back if you weren\u2019t going to follow through?\n\nIt seems like bride was clear from the beginning that she was okay with you missing the ceremony - she wanted the veil there at least to get photos.  If you were not okay with this, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it.", "Constance is TA. Isn't it the responsibility of the maid of honor to make sure the wedding party has everything, especially before relocating to a not nearby venue? She should have been the one to retrieve the veil.", "ESH- including the MOH for not triple-checking that all of the accessories were accounted for. Literally one of her most important duties.\n\nYou wouldn't have been as much an AH if you hadn't given up *after* retrieving the veil. You were literally on your way back & would have been there in time for her to at least get the photos. \n\nOf course,  her priorities suck rocks and I seldom support Bridezilla-level demands but very few people are thinking straight *on their wedding day* .  Emotions are running high, everything feels very exaggerated...it's not a good *excuse* for bad behavior but it is a good reason to let shit slide more than you would on another day. \nI understand why you were hurt, angry and frustrated, but I would have let her have this one (and held it over her head forever, because I am not without pettiness)", "NTA, you tried your best despite time is against you.\n\nI'm sorry that your family lacks of empathy and understanding.", "NTA, but your sister sure as hell is.", "NTA!!! My chuppah didn\u2019t work out. Multiple issues, mostly on the part of the venue, and we ended up just saying fuck it and moving on. The chuppah, by the way, is a critical symbolic aspect of the Jewish ceremony as it delineates the home you are making with your spouse. It\u2019s also absolutely jarringly absent from my wedding photos. And it\u2019s extra sad because we had a fantastic specialty chuppah made by a close friend entirely of beautiful twinkly lights, it would\u2019ve been utterly magical. \nNow let me tell you all about how we had an incredible wedding that embodied every Jewish tradition we could muster and felt perfectly suited for us, and I barely even think about the chuppah or the other things that didn\u2019t go perfectly. And no chance in hell I\u2019d have sent anyone, anyone, from our guests to go get a chuppah even if it were infinitely doable. A wedding is a fucking party, it should be tailored for your guests to enjoy themselves while sharing in your happiness. Anything else is a mockery of the institution.", "EFF her and that veil , NTA. You went above and beyond to try to make an impossible task happen. If she cared that much about it she would have made sure she had it before she left the house.

It was obvious you were going to miss the ceremony if you went for the veil so Odette was an ah for asking you to do it and for not caring about your presence as much as the veil.

I can\u2019t believe she asked you to do that.  That was very nice of you to do, and she never should have asked it of you.", "NTA. If the veil was that important she should have specifically assigned someone to make sure it was in the car or done it herself. You tried and she was shitty to you while you were actively trying and it sounds like you very likely weren't going to make it before the photographer left anyway.\n\nAlso, what is this \"first daughter\" shit? Are children who are not born first not worthy of being included in a supposedly treasured family tradition? I'm the oldest of 4 sisters and if my family pulled that I'd have refused to wear it.", "NTA. Sorry that she didn\u2019t get the veil, but it Was unreasonable to expect you to be able to get it back in time.", "Wait, so you could have gotten it there before the photographer left and been the hero, but decided to turn around and go home instead?

No, you totally are, and you can 100% feel hurt because you feel like you\u2019re less important than the veil.

The mere existence of hollow knives baffles me.", "I definitely do.  The lighter weight flatware forks feel like I should be using it them to tack something to a bulletin board rather than eating with them.", "I have a feeling you haven\u2019t lived in a high traffic area and know how bad gridlock can be. Yeah he was more than halfway there but it was an hour assuming more gridlock didn\u2019t happen so it was possibly another 1/2 a trip in horrendous traffic.", "If it\u2019s something as important as the veil how does that slip your mind. Just keep it with your wedding dress, it\u2019s still not on OP at all to be berated for something that the sister and MOH were responsible for. \nSure I\u2019ve forgotten things, but the difference is I don\u2019t blame and push my frustration on someone else.", "Compared to a living breathing human who was at risk of an accident by driving while exhausted, that veil was worth less than used toilet paper.", "Bridezilla was sure to accept a no I'm sure.\n\n  \n\n\nProbably would have told op to leave anyway not like she cared about her siblings being present the big day anyway", "I don't know that! Thank you", "I had spreadsheets galore for the wedding preparation. And one for the day itself. With multiple times where I had to tick things off as having been done it still having with me if they were that important. \nBasically by being so lackadaisical about it beforehand the bride has shown how little the veil meant to her. My guess is she just didn't want to be the one without it when she found out where it was.", "Totally get that, I have a preferred yogurt eating spoon and different forks that I choose for pasta, roast dinner, curries etc", "Yea its obvious from reading that everyone in this family is fairly shitty.", "Have you never done long driving?  She didn't say she was falling asleep", "Point still stands, and that\u2019s assuming the worst.", "Yes, I have. Apparently you haven't,  nor did you read what she said. She said she was exhausted.  Do you know what exhausted people do? They fall asleep. Whether its physical exhaustion or mental exhaustion,  the result is the same and both reduce awareness and response time. \n\nTired driving is as dangerous as drunk driving. A piece of fabric is not worth a life. Not even a super special veil that an entitled brat bride really wants to have for pictures that, realistically,  she could schedule for another time instead of endangering OP and treating her like crap.", "Yea but you talk about honor in your word.\n\n  \n\n\nSelf respect should be be higher then honor in your word.", "And?", "It is actually a tough call for me because I have flaked out of attending parties when I couldn't find parking after an hour of looking.  I have flaked out of a family event when traffic was an extra two hours and then I was looking at an extra two hours on top of that making a normally 1.5 hr drive going to be 5.5 hours, bailing at the 3.5 hour in mark.  And we had committed to be there.  \n\nI think the reason I see this as different is that I feel like she didn't leave because the drive took too long.  She left because she felt disrespected by the texts and attitude from the bride.  I guess to me it feels like you are bringing the birthday cake to the party and on the way the birthday kid is rude so you nope out and don't deliver it.  I guess maybe it is more valid than I felt.  Maybe it is ok to not give them the cake if they are rude.  But it feels like whining about something you agreed to do which is just a bad idea and something I see a lot.  \n\nI am wavering.", "They could have declined, that was OPs mistake. I\u2019m not gonna keep banging my head against the wall here.\n\nSome people don\u2019t value honor as much as me here, that\u2019s perfectly clear. I have enough honor and self-respect that I would either\nA: decline (personal choice)\nB: accept and follow through\n\nThis really shouldn\u2019t be complicated.", "Hope you are never in a situation where you accept to do something then get treated like shit because you will have to follow through even though doing so shows you have no self respect if you follow though.\n\n  \n\n\nGood luck in life."]}
