She has 3 kids(13F, 6F, and 4M) and upon living here I have helped babysit them a few times already which I don\u2019t mind at all and they\u2019re all pretty easy to hang out with. \n\nBut yesterday, I was in the city with the eldest daughter and remembered I ran out of shampoo and headed on over to target. I pick out my shampoo and head over to self checkout and as I was scanning my items, she scanned an item of her own? I was honestly really confused, but i decide to brush past it and continue on to get KBBQ for lunch. She then asked if we should invite her mom. Which I said i dont care, and she promptly said something along the lines of \u201cwell i don\u2019t want her to waste gas so you would have to go pick her up and come back to the city\u201d which left me kind of baffled? Because am I not wasting MY gas to go get her? Her mom ends up being busy so it didn\u2019t play out, but i was pretty upset with how inconsiderate that request was. \n\nToday, I opted to head out and explore LA alone after the incident that happened yesterday. As I began to head home from having dinner with a friend. Her daughter texts me and asks if I could pick up boba for her and her mom. I really did not want to so I just said if i see any i\u2019ll stop and get, but again I was on the highway the whole way home so it didnt play out. I arrive at their house and her mom isnt even home? I walk through the door and she had the gall to ask me \u201cDid u not get boba?\u201d I\u2019m just afraid this will become a pattern as I am still undergrad and trying to save money. \n\nI think my question is AITA for being stingy about things like this given that her mom is letting me live in their house for free? Granted her mom has never asked me for anything besides a few hours of my time to watch her younger children so I think it\u2019s strange that her daughter assumes I will buy her anything she wants. \n\nI paid for her starbucks one time willingly, but as someone older I just felt that that was the right thing to do.\n\nedit: hi! i see a lot of comments asking abt my contributions to my family friend\u2019s expenses! and just want to mass answer here, i have been living with them for less than a week so i havent really settled in quite yet but i do plan on doing groceries runs for her because with 3 kids, she is pretty busy herself.\n\nedit2: the item she scanned has been sitting in the target bag with my shampoo and its been 2 days since we went. just feels really inconsiderate and kind of disrespectful as it wasnt a cheap item", "created_utc": 1688564802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rb5sm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_paybuy_things_for_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The girl is only 13 and probably don\u2019t understand the whole arrangement.\n\nAnd of course, sometimes you should definitely buy some stuff for them and offer to help to show appreciation. But again, the mother should explain to the child how everything works.", "NTA. You have to nip this in the bud quick. She's 13 and knows exactly what she is doing. Trying to take advantage of you as someone a bit older than her and she thinks you have the money. I'd ignore texts with requests to buy her stuff and if you do ever take her out again, and she trys to pull that, I'd say, sorry, I'm really on a budget and can't purchase.\n\neDIT: Also, as far as you being there free, have you offered to chip in with any expenses? If not, you should.", "NTA, but talk to the mom.\n\nThe kid may may realize you have limited finances. She may be able to provide some finances to pay for the crap her kids want and try to get you to buy for them.", "NTA\n\nEldest daughter is trying to play you. Discuss this with the adult, you can't trust the child.", "NTA, someone is trying to take advantage, nip it in the bud!\n\nThat being said, you should probably be paying something to the household expenses or some food in the house.", "Kids will ask for stuff. They will always gladly let you pay for everything.  So until you say no, they will always ask because you never say no. \n\nShe is also using her mom as a way to get what she wants. So, tell her no, and if mom brings it up, then you can tell her what her daughter has been asking for and using her as an excuse to get stuff.", "NTA. \n\nYou and your friend- the mom- need to be on the same page about what her expectations are of staying in her home, and also the expectations of babysitting. \n\nTypically a babysitter wouldn't pay for things the kids needs/food or entertainment while you have the kids. But you aren't a typical babysitter, so if you take the kids for ice cream or to the zoo or something, I do think you should offer to pay since you are staying for free. But that is something you should figure out as you volunteer to take the kids places, or you are asked to take the kids somewhere. \n\nI think if you take a 13 year old out socially, there is an expectation that you pay. She doesn't have a job, she is likely used to adults just paying, and even if she gets an allowance she certainly isn't paying for dinner. So you should be thoughtful of when you take her with you to things, the expectation of paying and not taking her places like Target where, like any kid, she will want something. You can certainly decline to pay for things where she just reaches out and asks you to (boba for example), but if you don't want to pay for her lunch, for example, you shouldn't take her out to one unless you talk to her mom first and clarify who will pay.", "NTA You are definatly not her personal bank.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, you should have a chat with the mom about what expectations she has of you and what you are willing to do to pitch in. \n\nI\u2019d treat the daughter\u2019s greed as a separate issue. You have an agreement with her mom, but that has nothing to do with the daughter. \n\nIf the daughter asks for something again, ask her how she\u2019d like to pay. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll get you boba. I\u2019ll go grab it after you Venmo me.\u201d Or \u201cOops! If you want to buy something, you need to use your own checkout kiosk.\u201d \n\nKid knows what she\u2019s doing. Don\u2019t let her near your wallet. (Seriously, hide your valuables).", "Sounds like the daughter is being very entitled, where did she get the idea she could treat you as if you\u2019re her servant/ other parent?\n\nMight be time to start looking for your own place / different accommodation sooner rather than later before this friendship potentially turns sour.", "Nta. The teen is out of line and the mom is the only one you should be talking to in order to clarify expectations. What the child is assuming is very different from contributing to the household costs directly to the mom and/or providing childcare.", "NTA but...Kids are kids. She seems like an entitled brat, however, and you need to fix this now. From now on, next time she tries to invite herself to your wallet, advise her \"Yes, I will get you xyz IF you wash my car for me\" or something equivalent. Nothing is free in this world...Not boba's (?) or Starbucks burnt up coffee. \"You want it? You work for it\". Watch how fast that shit is shut down...", "NTA for not wanting to pay for a bunch of stuff. The 13 yo sees you as another wallet and is seems like she's trying to get what she can out of you. It's nice to be able to do something nice for your friend's family every once in a while, but you're under no obligation other than what you've agreed upon with your friend.", "ESH. I do think you should make an effort to do more for the family friend. Maybe offer to do grocery shopping and errands, as well as give a grocery gift card. They are sharing their space with you. I don't think the teenager has a right to demand anything.", "NTA. Your family friend\u2019s daughter is an enterprising little miss.", "NTA . The 13y/o is taking you for a ride. Unless the Mom specifically asks for money from you, you don't have to buy anything for them.", "NTA - The daughter is taking advantage of you.  She is old enough to know what she is doing and is playing on the fact that you are living there for free to get things from you.  Talk with her mom to make sure that your being there without paying is working out the way the mother is expecting. She is the one providing the home.  If you can contribute more, you should, but you should do it in the context of your friend's expectations, not because the daughter sees you as a personal piggybank.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She may be used to adults indulging her, but honestly who knows? If anyone has a leg to stand on regarding expectations, it's the family friend who is housing you, not her children. Nothing in your post refers to domestic labor or financial contributions for things like utilities and grocery because that's not what's being discussed here. This is a teen randomly expecting an adult to purchase her frivolous things (boba, whatever she got at Target) and volunteering your time and expenses (picking her mother up and driving back for kbbq, also the bill). Even if you were her mother, she's still grossly presumptuous. NTA", "And let the mother know what the 13 y.o. is doing.", "Exactly this. If I were OP, I'd just leave her messages unopened/unread and then feign ignorance. She'll get the message after she's been ignored a few times.", "I am baffled on why you said Esh, as yes Opie has stated that she is already babysitting and watching over the kids", "I would respond to the message with one word: No. This will get the message across more quickly and efficiently. I also would talk with the girls mother and hash out a plan for your contribution toward the household so there is no misunderstanding. The 13 yr is taking advantage of the current new status of your move in. Whether she knows the whole story or not is unknown at this point. That's why you need to work out a plan with her mother and implement it accordingly. Talk with her soon. In the meantime, say no to the requests.", "I think she could kick in for groceries once, too. I personally, think it's a burden to have someone stay in my house for an extended visit. She's still ahead of the game because she doesn't have to pay for accommodation. I'm baffled at your bafflement.", "Exactly. The mum is obviously happy with the arrangement. I can't understand this attitude people have to their house guests, like they have to bow and scrape for the privilege of being there.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Then don't invite people to stay or if you do, you work out the ground rules first. I'm sure that if this family friend wanted groceries, she would've asked for them. I was almost in the same situation last year with my friend's daughter (she need a place to stay) and I insisted on her staying with us rent free and not paying for anything because I don't need to take money from a student so I wouldn't. She didn't end up needing to stay but if she had I wouldn't have accepted anything from her. Maybe the family friend in OPs post is the same."]}
