She\u2019s not \u201cthrowing away their marriage\u201d she\u2019s reflecting on if she wants to be with a man who dismisses her valid concerns and doesn\u2019t stand by her", ">It\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest the brother is actually just socially awkward and doesn\u2019t necessarily realise what he is doing - \n\nThen why isn't the husband taking him aside and TALKING to him? If the brother genuinely doesn't know, the husband should be leaping at the chance to educate him. Instead, the husband made excuses and refused to address his brother's behavior. Which, by the way, is *escalating*. He's gone from comments to actually barging in on her in the shower. What's next? Do we need to wait for the brother to actually start putting hands on her for the husband to start taking this seriously, or will he make excuses for that too? OP's husband has already shown he cannot be trusted to have her back, so she's right to remove herself from a situation that is increasingly unsafe.  \n\n>though the shower incident seems a bit of a step too far (but why she didn\u2019t lock the door is beyond me).\n\nSHE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LOCK THE DOOR IN HER OWN FUCKING HOME. Jesus Christ.\n\nThe other side of the coin of the \"Reddit always jumps to divorce!\" trope is that there are always *these* comments that advise people to put up with truly toxic and unsafe shit in the name of preserving the relationship at all costs.", "Unwanted flirting, especially after being told to stop, is literally sexual harassment.", "To me, it's strange not to lock a bathroom door when in it.  Although I do appreciate there were reasons,  which is why I asked. \n\nOf course, I prefaced with unpopular opinion, I always do when it's not something I would automatically do (like lock a bathroom door)\n\nI believe in getting all the facts or as many as possible.  Is BIL socially awkward? Does he not get social cues?  There *could* be other reasons than he's a perv/predator.    It does NOT dismiss OPs safety.", "Landlines?  To me that's a house phone", "I agree they're barely plausible.  Without knowing if BIL is socially awkward or doesn\u2019t get social cues, it means questions for clarification are required. \n\nObviously OPs safety is paramount", ">The husband didn\u2019t care about the BIL walking in on her in the shower and made excuses for him.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I agree with OP getting out of there. \n\nHer safety is the important thing in this whole situation.  \n\nYes, I  ask questions for clarification, but at no point do I say she should have shrugged it off.\n\nYou absolutely have the right to be and feel safe in your own home.", "Don\u2019t be such a prude", "No one\u2019s diminishing your experience, but DV is way different than what OP is going through. She probably took many showers without locking the door with the BIL there and this was the first instance he felt enough gall to walk in on her which is why she packed up and left. She also said in other comments the door has an old key that they don\u2019t use. It\u2019s not on her to lock the door, it\u2019s on the BIL to not go in in the first place. Normal BILs wouldn\u2019t dream of crossing that boundary", "[deleted]", "If BIL is *genuinely* socially awkward, the husband's response should have been to immediately sit him down and educate him on why his actions weren't OK. Instead, he casts OP as the \"unreasonable\" one who is \"destroying the marriage\" for not wanting to be around someone perving on her.\n\nThis screams of a [missing stair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair) dynamic where everyone just manages around the brother instead of actually addressing his behavior head-on. Asking \"why didn't OP lock the door\" is just perpetuating the expectation that the responsibility lies with everyone else to do damage control.", "It is, so knowing she was in the shower, he walked in on her to look for the house phone? Are there other house phones or only one? Does he have a cell phone?", "It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s socially awkward or doesn\u2019t get social cues, His actions are making her uncomfortable in her own home. He doesn\u2019t get a free pass here, he\u2019s not entitled to stay there. \n\nBesides he claims to have gotten tons of women so either he\u2019s lying or the socially awkward claim is false", "Well he hadn\u2019t actually pulled a stunt like that until that point and her husband was blowing off her concerns. And what if she just forgot to lock it and he took his chance? She should be crucified for that one little detail? I don\u2019t lock my door when I shower either", "BIL was being creepy! Stop trying to jump through all these hypothetical hoops to justify this crap. A door locked, a landline, jesus leave the lady alone this isn\u2019t freaking clue.", "Like guys, don't exaggerate their \" pulling power\"?\n\nI asked if he's social awkward, he hasn't claimed it.", "What the hell? We have the right to ask questions. I am simply trying to figure out just how creepy or possibly predatory this guy is", "He\u2019s clearly socially inept for continuing to pursue his brothers wife when she clearly doesn\u2019t like it. The fact that he\u2019s brought up his \u201cpulling power\u201d at all to her in an attempt to make him more desirable and put down his brother (her husband) is weird.", "If anyone is any amount of creepy or predatory and living in someone\u2019s home for free the person living there is totally valid to want them out! There is a clear pattern of creepy behavior from BIL.", ">The fact that he\u2019s brought up his \u201cpulling power\u201d at all to her in an attempt to make him more desirable and put down his brother (her husband) is weird.\n\nAbsolutely.
