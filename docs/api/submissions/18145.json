If you didn't bring one how are you eating a cake that you didn't ask for?? Seems like out of both parties only one had organized a cake and if your table wasn't actually meant to get one then you all took advantage of the restaurants mistake and intentionally ate someone else's cake, I also highly doubt they would ask you to stop eating it after their mistake, it makes no sense to ask you too stop but they'd now have to pay out those customers because they gave the cake to people that didn't pay for it, this whole thing sounds more intentional then \"accidental' and if so that is stealing since you didn't pay them for the cake you ate\n\n\n>The waiter came over and asked us to stop eating the cake as it wasn\u2019t for us. We laughed as we thought it was a joke\n\nHow is this a joke? It does sound stupid but do you really think a random waiter would interrupt you, saying they have given you the wrong food, as a joke? You should have apologized and stated that you already started eating it and the responsibility falls on them\n\n\nThere are too many holes in this story, I'm pretty sure it's BS\n\nEdit: everyone is forgetting that the other party had balloons And presents on their table so unless the ops table set up looked the same, it's pretty clear which birthday table it was and if they looked the same they would have asked who brought the chocolate cake, they have to make sure because they now have to pay out that cake\n\n\nwho organized your get-together? They should have been confused and started asking questions since you all know that the shop doesn't sell cakes but nope all of you just shrugged your shoulders and dug in\n\n\nYes they may have awkwardly laughed but the actual point that they thought she was joking is stupid, no waiter would do that as a joke so they shouldn't be assuming that she said it as a joke\n\n\nThey had plenty of moments to see that wasn't theirs, seriously how would this post go if it was written from the other party's perspective? They'd be pretty pissed off that they ate their cake out of assumption and that is bs\n\n\nYou can ASSUME all you want but you need to take some bloody responsibility not just say \"i assumed this and that but I'm not going to actually make sure, not my fault \u270c\ufe0f\" but she's not the AH oh no\n\n\nI'm allowed to have my view and this is it, I don't need convincing", "YTA  You didn't apologize.

She delivered the cake to the restaurant on the day of the shower.\n\n**ETA** corrected details since I asked my friend:  The waitstaff taking care of the baby shower literally whisked the cake out and began cutting it before anyone could really get wind of whatever happened.  However, the condition of smushed areas and smeared icing *did* catch the attention of the guests, including the mom-to-be, so you can imagine how upsetting this was!  The manager claimed that the cake arrived without a box and already damaged.  The thing is, my friend's friend did not deliver the cake **minus** its box to an event as important as her own sister's baby shower.  \n\nThe relatives who planned, not to mention, and were **paying** for the shower asked point blank if the cake was dropped or knocked over.  The manager totally sidestepped the question.  Next, one of these family members asked how it could be made right, like a dessert tray to make up for the condition of the cake since it was obvious that the staff mishandled it.  The manager basically said there was nothing that they could contribute.  \n\nNow, the mom-to-be called B.S. because her wedding was there the year before, and there was a chocolate cheesecake she chose of the restaurant's to be served in addition to the wedding cake.  This is where the staff messed up yet again.  Instead of leveling that they didn't make the cheesecake since the restaurant was closed for two private events which both brought desserts, the waitstaff tried pulling the other cake...Yeah.  You can put together how pleased as punch this made *both* parties.\n\nIt's the end of the shower and it's time for the bill to be settled.  The mom-to-be asked for what remained of her cake and if the restaurant had a big box, plus any individual boxes to send home with guests.  The manager and waitstaff said no, so the next logical idea was aluminum foil because what restaurant doesn't have foil?\n\nNot this one.  They ended up finding those kinds of takeaway containers with the foil bottom and plastic top.\n\n[And you can see the result here](https://imgur.com/a/NxR9Tw4).\n\nPost-shower, the mom-to-be wrote the review and attached the picture.  According to my friend, the mom-to-be really wanted to keep out the other details since the restaurant hosted her reception a year prior, nor did she want to tear down a local business.\n\nIn defense of the restaurant, they have since turned themselves around and made up for that screw up.", "I think in this situation the other party brought their own cake, and the place doesn't have full cakes on hand for birthdays.\n\nAnyways that's the way it works where I work, if the customer wants a cake from us we have to know in advance to keep a full cake aside for them, other wise all cake are precut for the desert menu.", "This is also the lesson I\u2019ll be taking away from this post lmao", "Isn't this a health code violation anyways?

Who accepts an entire birthday cake, when no one at the table can confirm who bought it, thinking it was a joke or gift from a restaurant (which apparently does not even serve cake)? A single slice for the birthday person I can understand, but a whole cake? \n\nAnd on top of that you have the gall to laugh at the people whose cake you consumed. \n\nRestaurant made a mistake, for which they are liable, but they aren't TA just for that - you are.", "YTA", "Yes.", "Tim was having a birthday and a birthday cake came out to our table. You wouldn\u2019t assume it was meant for you table?", "We didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t organise the party. Tim\u2019s girlfriend did. So at the time, I thought may be she did.", "I like that a lot\u2026 No argument about them taking your cake or not\u2026 \u201cOh you want to take back my half eaten cake and give it to the other table sure here you go\u2026 Siri, how do you report a restaurant to the board of health.\u201d", "INFO: I\u2019m super confused on one key detail, what happened to the cake that was actually meant for Tim? Could the other table not have had that one instead?", " Nta. It\u2019s funny. Annoying for the other people but funny. No idea why they blamed you all? It\u2019s the restaurants fault clearly.", "I was celebrating my birthday alone last year in this place that is known for the waiters\u2019 hospitality, by that I mean they will just all gather around your table and sing Happy Birthday and wave LED signs and send fruit plate if your reservation mentioned it\u2019s your birthday. And the table next to me are a couple who were also celebrating birthday, after all the extravaganza at my table, they cut me a piece of their cake to celebrate. It was such a nice gesture and heartwarming and i\u2019m very grateful but I haven\u2019t the heart to tell them I\u2019m way too full to have another bite so I just stuff that large piece of cake right in my stomach lol.", "Tim didn\u2019t actually have one. Tim\u2019s girlfriend didn\u2019t organise one when she organised the dinner. Assumed everyone would be okay with just the dinner. I can only speak for myself when I assumed Tim\u2019s girlfriend DID organise the cake and didn\u2019t ask her because I never had done that in the past when a birthday cake came out at a birthday", "NTA as soon the people start to eat it was to late. No one can expect you to wait 10 minutes to make sure it's really for you.", "the waiter probably realized their mistake and tried doing damage control to cover their own ass, but it is still half eaten cake at that point.", "You think restaurants just give away whole birthday cakes?\n\nIt never dawned on you to ask who was responsible? \n\nYour story doesn\u2019t track dude.", "No, I assumed Tim\u2019s girlfriend brought it beforehand and gave it to the restaurant. A pretty normal custom where I\u2019m from. So normal that it\u2019s exactly what happened on the table next to us. Unfortunately the restaurant gave that cake to the wrong birthday table.", "Right, so Tim\u2019s girlfriend didn\u2019t think it was weird that some random cake she didn\u2019t order just showed up?\n\nI just don\u2019t believe your story.", "That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get why she didn\u2019t comment.", "Yes, and even at restaurants that have staff celebrate customers' birthdays, just the birthday person gets a slice of cake or a cupcake. They don't bring out an entire cake for everyone at the table.", "A whole cake? A slice for the birthday person, sure. But iveneverheard of them giving a whole cake away"]}
