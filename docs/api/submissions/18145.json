Seems like out of both parties only one had organized a cake and if your table wasn't actually meant to get one then you all took advantage of the restaurants mistake and intentionally ate someone else's cake, I also highly doubt they would ask you to stop eating it after their mistake, it makes no sense to ask you too stop but they'd now have to pay out those customers because they gave the cake to people that didn't pay for it, this whole thing sounds more intentional then \"accidental' and if so that is stealing since you didn't pay them for the cake you ate\n\n\n>The waiter came over and asked us to stop eating the cake as it wasn\u2019t for us.
