The dinner went by normally, and when it came for desert, some waiters came out with cake for Tim and sang happy birthday. We divided up the cake and began eating. \n\nTurns out the cake wasn\u2019t for Tim, and was meant for the table next to ours. The waiter came over and asked us to stop eating the cake as it wasn\u2019t for us. We laughed as we thought it was a joke and we were half way through at this point. We noticed the other table staring daggers at us. We stopped eating and didn\u2019t outright apologise, but said to the other table we didn\u2019t know. Who checks to make sure someone organised this cake specifically for Tim? You\u2019re at a birthday and you see cake so you eat it. \n\nAfter dinner the other table yelled at us in the car park calling us assholes for eating their cake and for laughing when asked to give it back.

This is the restaurant\u2019s problem not yours. The other group\u2019s anger was misplaced.

And once people were eating it, it was too late to just stop and give it back.", "Surly the restaurant gave the other table a new cake?", "NAH\n\nYou didn't know, the restaurant made an honest mistake, and other party was upset because you sort of stole from them. They shouldn't have yelled at you but it's understandable", "NAH. This was a mistake by the restaurant, not you. Unless the cake said \u201cHappy Birthday, Jeffrey\u201d or something, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that someone in your party provided or bought the cake for the group. \n\nAnyone blaming you for eating a cake you were handed is misdirecting the anger. And the other group does have the right to be upset about the mixup, but not at you.", "NTA. I am totally confused. The restaurant screwed up, you were already eating the cake which you naturally assumed was meant for Tim, and they expected you to hand it back? After you had been eating part of it? \n\nThe other birthday party's anger was misdirected and the restaurant manager should have bent over backwards to apologize to both parties. He/she should have apologized profusely to the people who paid for their cake, given them the dessert of their choice, and given them the  entire meal for free.", "NTA\n\nLots of restaurants bring out a free dessert, though usually just for the birthday person.", "NTA\nThe restaurant staff made the mistake. The other group should have understood that your group thought the cake was for your friend. It was not intentional on your group\u2019s part to take their cake.", "If the restaurant cut and served the cake and wasn't aware you weren't with the party, it's not your fault. You would have thought the table that brought the cake would have noticed it was being served to a different table, and gotten the waiter's immediate attention so they stopped distributing it to the wrong table. Once you guys started to eat it tho, I wouldn't want it back. But you could have apologized and explained you thought it was a joke!", "I mean why would you want a cake that other peoples germs have touched and possibly eaten from. They shoulda just accepted the restaurant made a mistake and moved on with it maybe swap around the money or whatever. Mistakes happen there should calm their fat ol farms and move on. Nta I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let the cake go to waste", "YTA and so are your friends. Did none of you have courtesy to ask which friend bought the cake n thank them? Was there no name written/tagged on the birthday cake? You personally may not be involved in planning this birthday but someone in your group must be.", "YTA - people don't just get given cake for birthdays at restaurants, they bring it with them and the restaurant just hands it out.

And no, definitely didn\u2019t say any names or have other identifying features on the cake. Just a regular ol\u2019 tasty chocolate cake", "It wasn\u2019t an exactly unique looking cake. Just chocolate with a bit decoration. The other table maybe saw the cake and thought we got a chocolate cake as well. Not the craziest coincidence to happen. So maybe that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t immediately let the waiter know.", "It was nice cake lol. At least, the half I had.", "We did not ask nor have I ever asked specifically who brought a cake to a party.

I assume his Girlfriend bought it earlier and gave it to the staff.", "Hmmm yes you took a different approach to this than I did on my comment. I agree with what your saying but maybe they also ordered a cake and the restaurant made a mistake on who to gone which one or they accidentally only made one of them also how would op know that they didn\u2019t order a cake until after they had the other party getting mad.", "How long did it take for the waiter to come back? You said about halfway through but no one at the table it belonged to noticed?", "YTA then. If it wasn\u2019t your cake and the other table actually wanted it back even after you started eating, you\u2019re the asshole.", "definitely misdirected, it\u2019s literally the restaurants fault. Even if you gave it back immediately it was already cut into and partially eaten. I wouldn\u2019t want it back at that point. The restaurant owes the party for their mistake.", "I\u2019d say it took about 5 minutes or so? \nI said in another comment, but it was just a fairly regular looking chocolate cake. So the other table definitely saw us get A cake (due to the happy birthday song) but maybe waited a bit to ask the staff where there cake was? I\u2019m not sure.", "If that\u2019s your judgement, fair enough.

Happy birthday was sung to a child there I sort of sang along clapped. Not long after a drink arrived. The waiter told me the grandpa saw me smiling poured out some sangria from their pitcher and sent it to me. I lifted the glass in a toast kind of way. Then suddenly a piece of the cake arrives. Grandpa waved. It was adorable. \nNTA yours was an honest mistake. Everybody loves cake especially if handed to them.", "NTA\n\n\n\nRestaurants tend to give out all sorts of desserts when it's someone's birthday (depending on what kind of restaurant and how big the bill is ig, etc.), so it's understandable that you didn't realise it wasn't meant for y'all.\n\n\nThe restaurant made the mistake. The other table should address their displeasure towards them, not your table.", "NTA.\n\nThe restaurant are assholes for making the mistake and asking for the half eaten cake back. Surely they're not going to serve that to the other party? \n\nThe other party have a right to be upset but they're assholes for directing it at you and not the restaurant.  They should have given up the cake as a bad lot and asked for free desserts and a discount. \n\nYou're not psychic or the organiser, how were you to know a generic cake wasn't intended for your table? It's understandable to incredulously laugh when you're asked to return a half eaten cake - that's ridiculous.  \n\nThe restaurant handled this badly and the other party reacted badly.

Obviously the restaurant's fault. The other party must be delusional to think that your party is at fault", "It\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s fault.

The restaurant didn\u2019t sell cakes. They had small desert items that I believe they tried to give to the other table to make up for it\n\nINFO since they don't sell cakes did you bring your own? If you didn't bring one how are you eating a cake that you didn't ask for?? Seems like out of both parties only one had organized a cake and if your table wasn't actually meant to get one then you all took advantage of the restaurants mistake and intentionally ate someone else's cake, I also highly doubt they would ask you to stop eating it after their mistake, it makes no sense to ask you too stop but they'd now have to pay out those customers because they gave the cake to people that didn't pay for it, this whole thing sounds more intentional then \"accidental' and if so that is stealing since you didn't pay them for the cake you ate\n\n\n>The waiter came over and asked us to stop eating the cake as it wasn\u2019t for us. We laughed as we thought it was a joke\n\nHow is this a joke? It does sound stupid but do you really think a random waiter would interrupt you, saying they have given you the wrong food, as a joke? You should have apologized and stated that you already started eating it and the responsibility falls on them\n\n\nThere are too many holes in this story, I'm pretty sure it's BS", "YTA  You didn't apologize. Doesn't sound like you probably offered another dessert to replace it. It was understandable that you ate what was served to you but all of you were jerks about it afterwards.", "Yta and the restaurant did you ask a question to the restaurant or your friends who brought a cake?", "NTA\n\nWait staff dropped the ball. If the other party wants to be mad be mad at them not you guys.", "NTA. This was the restaurants doing. It was not your tables fault in any way shape or form. What was the server planning to do when they told you to stop eating the cake? Serve what was left to the other table? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a health code violation.", "You're definitely NTA for starting to eat it, who wouldn't? But once you know it's not yours, if there's any left, you're kind of obligated to give it back. Not to say the other people would want it, but you're certainly obligated to offer it, which according to your edit, you did.\n\nNTA\n\nI do wonder if it's possible your group was less than diplomatic about it. Were there any profuse apologies?", "NTA- it was an honest mistake, and the people who brought the cake should have been mad at the restaurant, who should have paid to replace the cake. The fact that anyone was mad at you is ridiculous- it was a party of independent people, and literally no one is going to stop and verify that someone else at the table arranged for a cake at a birthday party.", "NTA.

That's very interesting.", "Exactly!\n\nHonestly I don't see why the restaurant didn't just apologize profusely to the other table, and bring out everyone's desert of choice on the house since the waiter is the one who brought the desert to the wrong table.", "I think everyone at the table assumed someone else had organised it, not that no one had.", "Each person knew that they themselves didn't bring a cake.  No one has knowledge about if anyone else ordered a cake in advance.\n\nIf you got to a table and people there had an appetizer, are you going to stop and ask \"which of you ordered this in case this was delivered by mistake\" before grabbing one?", "OP said they were celebrating a birthday so probably all the people in their group assumed someone else in their group ordered cake for everyone, it was someones birthday after all. It is not unreasonable to assume someone got the cake for the birthday.\n\nHaving cake when celebrating a birthday is not out of the ordinary, that's why no one questioned it, they just all assumed someone else had ordered it for the table. A very reasonable mistake.", "If it's a nicer restaurant, a complimentary dessert/cake is quite common for birthdays/anniversaries/etc. I've had this happen at least two-dozen times in my life, and I don't eat at fancy places all that often (\\~4 times a year)."]}
