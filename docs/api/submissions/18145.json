The dinner went by normally, and when it came for desert, some waiters came out with cake for Tim and sang happy birthday. We divided up the cake and began eating. \n\nTurns out the cake wasn\u2019t for Tim, and was meant for the table next to ours. The waiter came over and asked us to stop eating the cake as it wasn\u2019t for us. We laughed as we thought it was a joke and we were half way through at this point. We noticed the other table staring daggers at us. We stopped eating and didn\u2019t outright apologise, but said to the other table we didn\u2019t know. Who checks to make sure someone organised this cake specifically for Tim? You\u2019re at a birthday and you see cake so you eat it. \n\nAfter dinner the other table yelled at us in the car park calling us assholes for eating their cake and for laughing when asked to give it back. I assume if anyone are assholes, it\u2019s the restaurant. But what does reddit think? AITA\n\n****EDIT to add things addressed in comments: \n-the cake was a regular chocolate cake so maybe why the other table didn\u2019t notice it as there\u2019s straight away. \n\n-the waiter took about 5 minutes after serving us the cake to come back. \n\n-we did give the cake back after we realised it wasn\u2019t a joke and wasn\u2019t organised by someone at our table", "created_utc": 1685021712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rhzkt/aita_for_eating_someone_elses_birthday_cake/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the restaurant\u2019s problem not yours. The other group\u2019s anger was misplaced. You obviously didn\u2019t know the cake wasn\u2019t yours so what exactly is it they expected you to do?", "NTA, the restaurant fucked up by delivering the cake to your group. And once people were eating it, it was too late to just stop and give it back.", "Surly the restaurant gave the other table a new cake?", "NAH\n\nYou didn't know, the restaurant made an honest mistake, and other party was upset because you sort of stole from them. They shouldn't have yelled at you but it's understandable", "NAH. This was a mistake by the restaurant, not you. Unless the cake said \u201cHappy Birthday, Jeffrey\u201d or something, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that someone in your party provided or bought the cake for the group. \n\nAnyone blaming you for eating a cake you were handed is misdirecting the anger. And the other group does have the right to be upset about the mixup, but not at you.", "NTA. I am totally confused. The restaurant screwed up, you were already eating the cake which you naturally assumed was meant for Tim, and they expected you to hand it back? After you had been eating part of it? \n\nThe other birthday party's anger was misdirected and the restaurant manager should have bent over backwards to apologize to both parties. He/she should have apologized profusely to the people who paid for their cake, given them the dessert of their choice, and given them the  entire meal for free.", "NTA\n\nLots of restaurants bring out a free dessert, though usually just for the birthday person.", "NTA\nThe restaurant staff made the mistake. The other group should have understood that your group thought the cake was for your friend. It was not intentional on your group\u2019s part to take their cake.", "If the restaurant cut and served the cake and wasn't aware you weren't with the party, it's not your fault. You would have thought the table that brought the cake would have noticed it was being served to a different table, and gotten the waiter's immediate attention so they stopped distributing it to the wrong table. Once you guys started to eat it tho, I wouldn't want it back. But you could have apologized and explained you thought it was a joke!", "I mean why would you want a cake that other peoples germs have touched and possibly eaten from. They shoulda just accepted the restaurant made a mistake and moved on with it maybe swap around the money or whatever. Mistakes happen there should calm their fat ol farms and move on. Nta I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let the cake go to waste", "YTA and so are your friends. Did none of you have courtesy to ask which friend bought the cake n thank them? Was there no name written/tagged on the birthday cake? You personally may not be involved in planning this birthday but someone in your group must be.", "YTA - people don't just get given cake for birthdays at restaurants, they bring it with them and the restaurant just hands it out. You would have known it wasn't yours and should have immediately apologised when you were told it wasn't yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The  restaurant should have gotten another cake.", "The cake was given to the restaurant to give to their table. The restaurant didn\u2019t sell cakes. They had small desert items that I believe they tried to give to the other table to make up for it", "I totally understand them being upset. They paid for that cake and gave it to the staff to deliver to their birthday person. And we got it. But I just felt their anger was misdirected.", "OP's table didn't steal anything and the table it belonged to were wrong for yelling. The restaurant was at fault!!!!!!", "Thank you. And no, definitely didn\u2019t say any names or have other identifying features on the cake. Just a regular ol\u2019 tasty chocolate cake", "It wasn\u2019t an exactly unique looking cake. Just chocolate with a bit decoration. The other table maybe saw the cake and thought we got a chocolate cake as well. Not the craziest coincidence to happen. So maybe that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t immediately let the waiter know.", "It was nice cake lol. At least, the half I had.", "We did not ask nor have I ever asked specifically who brought a cake to a party. The party was organised by Tim\u2019s girlfriend so I assumed it was her and we of course thanked her for organising the party as a whole. \nThere was no name or tag on the cake when we received it.", "All I knew was I didn\u2019t bring it for Tim. I assume his Girlfriend bought it earlier and gave it to the staff.", "Hmmm yes you took a different approach to this than I did on my comment. I agree with what your saying but maybe they also ordered a cake and the restaurant made a mistake on who to gone which one or they accidentally only made one of them also how would op know that they didn\u2019t order a cake until after they had the other party getting mad.", "How long did it take for the waiter to come back? You said about halfway through but no one at the table it belonged to noticed?", "YTA then. If it wasn\u2019t your cake and the other table actually wanted it back even after you started eating, you\u2019re the asshole.", "definitely misdirected, it\u2019s literally the restaurants fault. Even if you gave it back immediately it was already cut into and partially eaten. I wouldn\u2019t want it back at that point. The restaurant owes the party for their mistake.", "I\u2019d say it took about 5 minutes or so? \nI said in another comment, but it was just a fairly regular looking chocolate cake. So the other table definitely saw us get A cake (due to the happy birthday song) but maybe waited a bit to ask the staff where there cake was? I\u2019m not sure.", "If that\u2019s your judgement, fair enough. But we did give it back after we found out it wasn\u2019t brought by someone at our table.", "I can\u2019t give a judgment if you don\u2019t put the information in the post", "Apologies, that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to answer any questions as they come up", "Others are going to say the same, you should edit your post", "Will do. I\u2019ll add in we gave it back. Anything else?"]}
