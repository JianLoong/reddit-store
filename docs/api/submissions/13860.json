AND then you\u2019re saying you fell in love with her personality? That may be true but come on, that\u2019s damaging her confidence too!\nYou\u2019re supposed to support her, but that was a bad misstep. Do you even like her physically? Try to enforce it in small areas and be subtle, rather than posting edited photos of her and blasting them onto social media of all places.", "YTA.\n\nShe's insecure about her body type, and what do you do? Alter her body in the photo, essentially telling her that she *should* be insecure about it.", "YTA you shouldn't do that without her permission.  It comes off like you're ashamed of her, think she's overweight etc, even if not the case.", "Yeah, YTA. 1. for not asking her if she is ok for you to post her pictures online 2. for taking liberties  to change these pics and make them look like what you THOUGHT she would like, essentially body shaming her. If you really didn\u2019t mind you wouldn\u2019t have changed them.", "Oh my goodness do you even have to ask? YTA, you've just fed into all her insecurities and made her think you prefer her like that. ESPECIALLY describing it as a \"hot hourglass body\", implying that her figure isn't - its no wonder the poor girl has hang ups.", "YTA. Why would you edit her pictures like that? Yes, you explained it, but that makes no sense. You gave her a body that she wants but doesn't have! The message *to her* is that you wished she looked like that.\n\nYou don't make people **more** confident by editing them to remove the \"problem\". That actually draws their attention TO the problem, and reminds them it \"is\" a problem.\n\nIf *she* wants to edit her own pictures to sculpt her image, she can do that. If you love her just the way she is, post her just the way she is! Posting anything else shows her that you wish she looked different.

YTA big time. Guarantee you just made her 1000%x more self conscious. You knew she was comparing herself, but instead of confirming that she is beautiful and there are SO MANY types of beauty, or uploading the pics as is and showing off how gorgeous you think she is... you decided to introduce her to your online world by drastically changing her appearance, knowing her weak spot. \n\nGood chance you're about to be single again.. and deservedly so.", "YTA. \n\nYou just confirmed her worst fears. If she edited the photos then that is one thing, but you doing it without speaking to her and then posting them online was a terrible plan.\n\nImagine if she pushed a pic online but she altered you features so you were a more attractive, fake version of yourself.

What you should have been saying all along is that you love her body and think she's beautiful.

Your GF needs to know you love her and find her attractive.

It's not ok.", "You are the asshole. \nYou say you fell in love with your girlfriend for her personality which sounds like you don\u2019t find her attractive, if my partner told me that I\u2019d be deeply hurt. For someone who is already insecure about her appearance I\u2019m sure it sounds to her like you are confirming what she believes. \n\nFor someone who states he loves her for how she is you go into a lot of detail describing how her waist isn\u2019t defined and you yourself compare her to your ex by stating your ex had a nice figure. No one wants to be compared to anyone and especially not an ex girlfriend, I don\u2019t believe that you can\u2019t see that and it seems you are using it to put her down. If she\u2019s comparing herself to your ex as well as you then that\u2019s because you\u2019ve led her to believe you find your ex girlfriends body more appealing to you and that level of insecurity can be emotionally damaging. \n\nYou mentioned you haven\u2019t posted any pictures of your girlfriend on your account and so you edited pictures so that people (including your ex?) who haven\u2019t met her don\u2019t see the real her. You make it look like you are so unhappy with her appearance that you have to change it in order to post pictures of her. \nYou are highlighting her insecurities not reassuring her like you claim you are to excuse why you are doing this. \n\nIf you posted pictures showing exactly how she is then she would believe that you really love her, instead you are making it seem that you have to change her in order for people to see you both together. With you saying you gave her \u201ca hot hourglass figure\u201d in these pictures it shows you don\u2019t find her figure hot. I hope you didn\u2019t say that to her face? if you did then you are one of the biggest assholes to post on here. \n\nIf you truly love her as she is then why do YOU need to edit pictures? If she had suggested it then this would have been the opportunity to say you are proud of her and find her beautiful and don\u2019t want her to change. \nCan you imagine if she edited the first pictures she had taken of you before she posted them on her social media pages? If she made you taller or changed your body shape, would that make you feel like she accepts you as you are?\n\nWhen people meet her in real life and compare her to those photographs that will make her more insecure as you\u2019ve changed the parts of her appearance she\u2019s unhappy with and drawn attention to them. \nI think you need to admit that you are the one who is making your girlfriend insecure. Just by this post alone you have proved you would prefer her to have a curvier figure. Does she compare herself to your ex because you compliment your ex\u2019s body? Has she met your ex girlfriend in order for her to make a comparison, or is it just based what you say and the comments you make? \n\nIf you want to stay in this relationship then you need to change your behaviour and decide if your girlfriend is enough for you. Your behaviour is abusive by constantly putting her down but then making her feel like it\u2019s she who has the problem with her body and not your. You lied to her when you said you don\u2019t care about how she looks and then proved exactly that you do by changing her appearance in photographs for mainly people you know to see. \n\nI think she should walk away now and find someone better who loves her exactly how she is. If she does choose to stay with you then you need to stop hurting her and really work on showing her you find her beautiful inside and out. Stop comparing her to ex girlfriends and stop focusing on her body shape.

She now believes that you don't find her attractive as she is. \n\nYou said \"I fell in love with you because of your personality,\" and you did not say, \"And you're incredibly beautiful as you are!\" Has anyone tried to set you up with a girl by saying, \"she's got a great personality.\" Men say that because they can't say, \"she's ugly man, but she's nice.\" \n\nYTA \n\nAnd now you're probably the ex. Learn from this or end up with someone horrible because no high-quality woman is going to put up with misogyny.", "YTA by editing her photos your telling her you don't like her body and wish she had an hour glass..\nIf you wanted to edit her photo you should have asked her about it first instead of being an asshole  and jumping to edit it before she could even see or know about it.\nHonestly you broke the trust and she probably will never forgive you and will probably break up with you.\n\nI'm female so I am talking from a female view.\nYou need to smarten up before you do something else", "Wow\u2026YTA\u2026literally body shame your girlfriend\u2026and posted it for the whole world to see how you would like her body to be.", "YTA!!!!!!!! You've just confirmed what your gf was afraid of. Her insecurities are her own issues to deal with but you have set her way back. If someone who claimed to like me edited a photo like this I would truly be devastated.", "YTA.\n\nAlso:\n\n>My new girlfriend\n\n> I fell in love with her\n\nBounding around the word love with a new girlfriend... \n\nThe photo editing... \n\nI think you should work on your own emotional maturity.", "YTA - she needs to just throw this whole man away.", "Duuuude come on.... you have to know you effed up here.

Your girlfriend is demonstrating that for you.", "I mean can you take one fucking second to put yourself in her shoes. She\u2019s obviously concerned about her body shape and your \u201chelpful\u201d editing reinforces that.

I don't believe you either.\n\nYTA", "YTA.", "YTA  You only reinforced her bias against herself.  And publicly.   Way to go in reassuring her your there for her personality.", "Yup. \"Gave her a hot hourglass body\".", "I get that I'm in the wrong but no matter what I do, she's complaining. I tell her that I don't care about her waist and she's still complaining. I think she needs therapy because I can't help her with those insecurities", "She's not overweight. She's thin and she's not insecure about her weight. She's insecure because her waist is shaped like a square. Her ex boyfriend told her she was built like spongebob and I think that's why she's insecure now. Even though I think her ex was just joking, it's kinda funny lol but I get why this made her insecure. I will apologize after she reaches out to me", "Here's a fun tip for OP\u2026 Body shaming people never makes them feel better about themselves!", "Because haven't you ever had a guy try to set you up with a girl by saying, \"She has a great personality.\" You know damn well what that means.", "Why not?", "Well it gets annoying hearing her complain about the same things 600 times a week. I'm willing to listen but even I have my limits", "Yeah that's what I was thinking too.

Because there's a big difference between the two. Saying you don't care implies that she's not attractive to you, but you're choosing to ignore it. Saying she's beautiful as she is... Well, that's self-explanatory.", "By saying you don't care, you're reinforcing that her waist is still a flaw, and that a \"hot hourglass\" is still superior. What you should be saying is that her body is hot just the way it is.", "You tell her you don't care about her waist, but then you describe it in an unappealing way, call your ex's shape hot, and photoshop her to look like the ex.

I\u2019m sure you have insecurities too. Think of the feature you\u2019re most insecure about on yourself. Now imagine your ex-girlfriend made jokes about it constantly. Other people laughed at these jokes, making ridiculing comparisons.", "She's complaining because you are still failing to take responsibility for your harmful choices. \n\nIf you cannot take responsibility for your behavior, then you do not deserve her forgiveness.", "Saying you don't care is telling her it IS a problem, just one you don't care about and can look past", "She doesn't need you to help her, and she doesn't need you to reinforce them how you did.

You're really telling on yourself here, OP.", "Okay, have an adult conversation about it -- that you need to set some limits on this conversation bc you're getting burned out.
