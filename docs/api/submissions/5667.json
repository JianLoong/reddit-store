Your mom sucks. Showing your sister love and acceptance is totally worth getting grounded for. Too bad your mom can't find it in herself to do the same for her own daughter. Keep prioritizing your sister.", "NTA, you gave a gift from the heart that your sister likes and that validates her interests. Your mom was out of line to try to dictate what you could and couldn't give. She is also blind as a bat that she can't see how cool it is, or how harmful it is to put down her daughter's interests! But she clearly has some sort of aversion to...cool science, and doesn't want it in her house. She does have a right to not lok at stuff in her home that disturbs her.

I would not go so far to say your mom doesn\u2019t care for your sister, I don\u2019t have enough info. To determine that.  She may care for her deeply but have this one blind spot.  Maybe her fear is irrational.  That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real to her.  But she definitely needs to explain her issue much better to both you and your sister, because neither of you are children.\n\nBecause you are not a child, when you get back from your dads if she sticks to her grounding threat, try and have an adult conversation with her.  I\u2019d apologize for the only single thing you might have done wrong - not for going against her wishes and buying a gift your sister appreciates, but by not telling her you were going against her wishes anyway and your plan B about your dads house upfront.  But tell her you and your sister can\u2019t develop a good adult relationship if your mom is throwing irrational wrenches into your relationship.  Tell her you will respect her wishes - when it makes sense to you, but she can\u2019t do thinks like pre-approve gifts you and your sister give to each other paid for with your own money.  Hopefully your mom will be as rational and mature about this as you are.", "NTA but you could probably learn a few things about keeping the peace. Maybe you could have given your sister the gift another time?", "NAH. Agree with your Dad.", "This brought a smile to my face. You are a good person.\n\nNTA\n\nIt sounds like your sister is not deeply into the spectrum, is pleasant to be around and helpful. Sure her interests might be seen as odd by your mother but in a different family (say biologists that take trips to catalogue new species) it would be perfectly normal. You have done well by your sister, and your mother is being unreasonable. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I know how to best deal with the fallout, as I think it takes more details than you should share here. However I think your best approach is to take a little time off (a day or two) then discuss it with your father, as he seems more sympathetic. You could emphasize how much you sister helps you, and how that makes you want to support her in her interests.\n\nEdit: I somehow missed that these are separate households\u2026 perhaps consult with your father about how to placate your mother, but ask him not to bring it up to her himself. Another idea would be to have the whole collection at your fathers house who endorses it, but that\u2019s a discussion for the two of you to have with your sister. She may not like this idea, this is more difficult than I thought.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But once I read that the gift could go on your dads house and not BE in your moms house, this became a no-brainer.

Though the rest of my family (aunts and such) are not and we do Christmas with them too so I can understand the strife a bit. I saw your comments about how you do one gift at your mom's and the other at your dad's... Maybe you can do something like what my parents and siblings do (since your dad seems more supportive of the interest)? What my parents and siblings do is at the family gathering with my aunts and such, they will gift me more low-key-but-still-within-the-interest items. For example, I also collect pins and patches for my denim jacket, so they will get pins and patches that are things like animal skulls, bugs, etc.. Once my sibling got *super* creative and got me a necklace where the pendant is a horse head carved from elk bone. It doesn't look like bone to the naked eye and it resembles other common jewelry materials like ivory or white quartz. When we do our strictly-just-ourselves gift exchange at home that is when I'll get gifted things like actual animal skulls, pinned bugs, and animals in jars.", "Other parents are worried about their 16 year olds getting drunk, doing drugs, or messing their lives up in some way.
