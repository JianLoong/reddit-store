My mom was married with three kids when she started an affair with another married man. I was born 2 years into the affair. My mom's ex-husband (husband at the time) found out I wasn't his kid and he filed for divorce and with the courts to establish he wasn't my father so he wouldn't be on the hook for child support for me. I'm biracial and my mom and her ex-husband were completely white while I have always looked like I was born to two black parents. So there was no denying that her husband was not my father.\n\nMy half siblings from my mom were all 8 and older when I was born. They were perfectly aware of the fact I was someone else's kid and not their dads and they hated me for it. I think to them if mom had just been cheating and I hadn't been born, their parents could have stayed together.\n\nDuring my childhood mom exposed me to her hypocritical religious family who despised me for being a child born out of wedlock, they treated it like a curse. I was exposed to her other kids who would tell me to my face I was repulsive and disgusting. To her ex-husband during their kids school events or games, etc. He would glare at me or curse at me and he called me names when I was around him. His family were there sometimes and they also hated me. Mom would also make sure we sat as close to them as we could and she would also grocery shop at the same time and place as them. She never supported me. Sometimes I feel like she brought me around these people because they hated me more than her and she could just sit there while I took all of their vocalized hatred. Mom did it way too often to not be something she was doing to make herself feel better in my opinion.\n\nShe also tried to bring me around my father's family and that went as well as it did with her own. They would shut the door in our face, I was called a bastard and affair baby, I was reminded every time we showed up that not one of them wanted me, not even him, and also not her family, either her kids or her parents and siblings.\n\nMy childhood was miserable and mom never cared to protect me. So when I went to college a few years ago I started distancing myself slowly until I no longer reached out to my mom. I never told her either. But she would call sometimes and I would ignore her.\n\nI have been with my girlfriend for more than 3 years now and we're expecting a baby. My mom found out through social media and tracked me down and showed up at my place and demanded to know why I shut her out and why I didn't even tell her about her grandchild. I told her she gave me a shitty childhood and she never seemed to care. She told me I couldn't expect her to toss away everyone else she loved just for me. That's when I told her she should have placed me for adoption then because it would have been better than growing up hated. She told me I would never understand the sacrifices she made for me and I should be ashamed to wish for that when I have a child on the way.\n\nAITA?

The reason I might be the asshole is I know my mom did keep me when many others would not have and because of that at least I know the truth about my biological parents and I don't have questions with no answers. Keeping me meant her kids hated her more. It meant she was always faced with what she did.

I'm guessing you made it clear she's not allowed around you or your family, ever, yes?", "NTA\n\nShe didn't protect you, she didn't advocate for you, she failed you.  She and your bio-dad are the guilty parties.  She should've shouted that from the rooftops.  You didn't choose how you were born or to whom.  You only had her to rely on and she failed you.  She chose everyone else over you who had no one", "NTA.  You made an honest and correct observation\n  She used you as a meat shield to try and protect the remnants of her destroyed life.  \n\nAdoption would have been kinder, or ya know, actually shielding her kid from stuff like that....", "NTA\n\nYou grew up in an environment where your emotional and mental health weren't protected and you were the figurative whipping boy for the anger and resentment felt toward your mother for her infidelity. She allowed you to endure the abuse so that she didn't have to, and that's abuse in and of itself. You not wanting her to have anything to do with you or your child is what a good parent would do and obviously an act your mother simply cannot recognize as it is a foreign concept to her.", "NTA. You spoke your truth to her. \n\nCongratulations on your coming baby and best wishes for the family you're building", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that, you most definitely did not deserve it. \n\nFor your sanity, stay NC with any and all of them. \n\nYou\u2019re about to have your own little family, cherish that.", "NTA. I'm really heartbroken for you. You mom failed you on every level. You are an adult now, living your own life, and should absolutely speak your mind to your egg donor. You may consider making the no contact permanent. There is really nothing she could offer you except more hurt and narcissism. Congratulations on your baby, I hope they feel all the love and support you deserved.", ">She told me I couldn't expect her to toss away everyone else she loved just for me.\n\nYea, you could have. You never asked to be born and dragged into her family drama from the get go. You were the only innocent in all this and she should have prioritized protecting you from the vitriol. She didn't have to toss away anyone she loved, just accept that everyone she loved tossed her away instead of forcing herself in their lives. What an ass.\n\nNTA go back to NC OP, you don't need this crap. And congrats to the baby.", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cmom\u201d is no better than all those she let abuse you. \n\nShe\u2019s a full blown narcissist and to make herself feel better about what she did, she made you the villain/pariah to exempt herself from taking accountability. \n\n\u201cIf I jump on the \u2018attack OP\u2019 bandwagon then the heat won\u2019t be on me\u201d \n\nYou have every right to keep her away from and protect yourself and your family, being subjected to her venom, her racism and prejudice. \n\nI wish you the best of luck moving forward and with your new baby!", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry OP. I hope you and your partner and baby have every happiness together.", "NTA. \n\nShe made no sacrifice. Don\u2019t let her even try that shit. \n\nShe failed you, epically and completely. She failed to protect you. She allowed you to take all the hate from everyone that should have been directed at her. She allowed her ex, his family, and her family to verbally abuse you - a child who had zero control of the situation. This was all her doing. \n\nCongratulations on your baby!", "NTA. It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t let you have a better family growing up. I\u2019m sure there were families out there who would have loved to adopt you and would have loved and protected you. Your mom sounds selfish and awful. She didn\u2019t sacrifice anything for you, she just was dealing with the repercussions of her own actions.", "NTA. She sounds like a shitty parent. She made sacrifices because SHE cheated. Her husband left her because SHE cheated. She never defended you, I'm so sorry for what you went through. Take care of your kid. Be the parent you never had. And your mom, if she wants to be in your child's life she should at least show some remorse and change her attitude towards you. Unless that happens, NC would be a viable option. Don't subject your kid to the same treatment.", "NTA.\n\nShe says she made sacrifices for you, but she didn't really. Her husband left because she chose to cheat. Her family, his family and your dad's family all hated her for her choices. Any hate her kids had for her, came from her own choices. She didn't move, change her shopping habits or try to build a community of trusted people for you to rely on despite her mistakes. She didn't leave you with friends or let you visit friends while SHE visited her family or saw her other kids.\n\nShe didn't discipline her kids for their misplaced anger at you. She didn't tell off ex-husband for what a dick he was for picking on an innocent child.  She didn't act like a MOTHER to you. She acted like someone glad to have a meat shield to take some of the anger and hatred for her so that she had someone to suffer with her.\n\nThere was a lot she could have ACTUALLY sacrificed and changed for you, but she never did.\n\nIt sounds like she was fine destroying as many lives as she could quite honestly, so why would you ever want her near you, your girlfriend or your child with how destructive she is and how miserable she seems to try to make absolutely everyone? \n\nShe got a LOT of adults to literally hate and pick on a child for an entire childhood. Giving you up for adoption would have been a lot kinder than purposefully exposing you to people that hated you repeatedly.\n\nKeeping you would have been selfless if she then ACTUALLY made sacrifices and took actions to protect you. But in not doing that, it was entirely selfish and involved a lot of needless suffering on your part so she could keep trying to be around people that hate her.\n\nYOU sacrificed YOUR entire childhood against your will so she could be the second most hated person in the room instead of the most hated.", "NTA  IF you don't want her in your life then that's how it is and she'll just have to deal with it!", "NTA.  My goodness what a wretched mother, and family in general.  \n\nGood job growing that shiny steel spine, despite their abuse.  \n\nEnjoy your happiness and give none of them any more or your time or energy!", "NTA.  I hope to goodness you get some therapy and put up some boundaries between you and your mother.  Said boundaries should probably include a moat.", "I do want to add that op this is because your mom is a bad mom. Being the product of an affair doesn\u2019t mean you get a shitty childhood based just on that. She didn\u2019t protect you. That has nothing to do with the affair", "NTA.\n\n'Sacrifices'.  I do not think that word means what you think it means...\n\nShe abused & abandoned you.\n\nWant to bet that without hacing YOU to kick around, your older half-sibs have ostracized & shunned her, maybe even deciding to NOT have kids just to spite her?", "NTA. Sorry you had to endure that kind of childhood. It sounds like you have a good life now and there is no reason these people have to be part of it.", "Your mother is a vile human being. NTA", "Your mother is  a narc and I am proud of you for standing up to her.  I get where you are coming from, I too was beaten repeatedly for being born.  \n\nYour mother all of a sudden wants to be included, don't include her, as she does not deserve it.  Protect your little family from that abuse, and let your little one grow up happy without all the hate and ignorance.  I would block her on social media too, so she gets nothing.  \n\nAdoption would have been easier and better on so many different levels.  Imagine being adopted by a family that wants you.  People that care and love you, and want you to succeed.  I have thought about that too, and how much better life would have been.\n\nUnfortunately, that did not happen.  But you have the chance to make your life great now, so do it, and don't ever look back.", "NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry they all treated you so badly :(.

And I hope you are happy with your partner and future child. \n\nYour mother did not protect you -she used you to shield her when her job was to protect you.  She does not deserve your consideration. You were right in what you said. None of this was on you and you bore the brunt. \n\nNTA.", "what 'sacrifices'? you said it yourself. she was almost certainly using you to take the heat off of her and her choices. she deliberately brought you around people who made it clear they hated you, time and time again. why would she expect you to be thankful for that?

Everyone else in this, though, except you and your gf... Oof.\n\nBe clear that you have severed this relationship, and with no relationship to you, she has no relationship with your child.  She is not going to be a grandmother to your children.\n\nDo what you need to for your own protection and to protect your family.", "NTA\n\nHer actions subjected you to all this and she doesn\u2019t care. Two and a half decades later she\u2019s still only worrying about how it effects her. All the other adults are ah too- your mom is the one who had the affair.", "I don't know what to say here. It is painful to read how an innocent child, with no control over the situation, became the punching bag for a pack of AHS. \n\nYour mother was the worst. I can't believe how she can go on with her life and be okay with herself\n\nKeep this toxic AH far far far away from you, your family and your child\n\nFocus on your amazing progress and your beautiful family\n\nso N.T.A.", "NTA, but everyone else was.

When you're a child your life is created by those around you. You've grown up. Now you are the one to take care of you. YOU create the life you want now. Is there room in your life - and upcoming child's life - for the hatred you experienced? \nDefinitely NTA. Go on to garden a beautiful life for yourself and your child. Congratulations!!! \ud83c\udf8a", "NTA. Block her and go NC.", "NTA. And she wasn\u2019t a mother, she birthed you and then used you as a shield to absorb everyone\u2019s hate for her/her actions.

She cheated and wanted you to be punished for being the undeniable proof. I\u2019m sorry you had that childhood. Don\u2019t be tricked by your mom, she\u2019s selfish and will continue to punish you", "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this \ud83d\udc94", "She made sacrifices? you're the one who got sacrificed!", "NTA. All those adults failed you. I cant imagine the racism you faced. I wish poc would stop procreating with racist people and subjecting/leaving their kids with the racist white families. \n\nStay no contact!", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ll be blunt. That lady who carried you is a flaming pile of sh*t. That is not a mother at all, to any of you kids.", "NTA so sorry for how things were but look forward to the things that are happening now. Also don't have much contact. Especially alone ever you know?", "NTA\n\nYou are speaking from your heart and standing up for what you deserve. I am so proud of you for that. I know trauma can linger when you're around the person who abused you, and it's completely understandable to not want to be around the abuser. You know your worth and that's something so important. And you said it in a rational and justified place. Honestly, she never fulfilled her role as a mother to you and therefore she does not deserve your time and she definitely doesn't deserve your family's time. You put your girlfriend and child first, and kept them from having to possibly face trauma themselves.", "NTA but your mom is, and she lacks any kind of moral fiber.\n\nShe had an affair, had the baby, and kept expositing you to her ex-family, who hated you and let her know it.  That's HORRIBLE.  \n\nShe didn't \"sacriffice\" for you.  YOU WERE THE SACRIFICE.  Tell her that.", "> She told me I couldn't expect her to toss away everyone else she loved just for me. \n\nThe way she tossed her marriage down the drain? \n\nNTA first of all. You were selfishly used as a meat shield by your mother because she couldn\u2019t handle facing and confronting what she did.\n\nI am so sorry about all the vitriol and hatred spewed at you, and I genuinely wish you the best. You are enough and you are loved by your girlfriend and you will be loved by your future child. You don\u2019t need that toxic family in your life.", "NTA.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t know the definition of \u201csacrifice,\u201d even if it walked up to her and smacked her in the face. I\u2019m sooo sorry for what you had to endure from those people as a child. You deserved to be happy, loved, respected, and cherished. You deserved a home that provided you with emotional and mental fortitude. At the very least, your mother should have protected you from her and your father\u2019s side of the family\u2019s vitriol. \n\nJust focus on your girlfriend and the baby you\u2019re about to welcome in a few months. Just be the best parent you could possibly to your future child(ren).", "NTA I would get a restraining order. She and all the people surrounding her and your bio-dad and her ex are all vile.", "NTA.  I\u2019m so sorry.  I wish you\u2019d had the childhood you deserved.\n\nI hope your give your own child love and security and joy.  Best wishes.", "NTA.  Unfortunately, you were your mom's meat shield that she hid behind like a coward.  You would've had a better shot at a decent childhood if you had been given up for adoption.", "NTA \n\nShe wanted to get back with her family so bad she ignored their comments. Sounds like she was trying to force forgiveness so she wouldn\u2019t be shunned. She was trying to make them accept you. She was so delusional, she thought she could get her family back. At least that what it sounds like. Sometimes it does work, but she should have been a mother first.  \n\nThe families are wrong, even if the disapproved they should have kept quiet. No child deserves this. They were so angry at her and because you are black, black kids are seen as adults. As a black women I see how black little boys are treated vs little white boys. I\u2019m so sorry you went through that. \n\nI just read a post that the brother adopted the affair baby and his mother whom was cheated on cut contact with. I think that\u2019s the wisest move because if she can\u2019t accept his half sister then she should stay away. Know who you are and distance yourself. The child is innocent. At least keep your mouth shut.\n\nI\u2019m so glad you found and made your own family. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all.  Your mother, your half siblings, your mother's family. your bio father, bio father's family, your mother's ex husband are ALL Assholes.  They failed miserably to provide any kind of care or concern for you.  Good for you for getting them out of your life.  All the best to you, your girlfriend and your baby.", "Absolutely NTA, and you're right, she should have.", "I'm so sorry you went through that.", "NTA. She wasn't a mom.", "NTA. Almost everyone else is, though. I get that your presence is a trigger that reminds them of painful history, but taking it out on a child who had no control over those events is difficult to forgive. Them making it your problem and abusing you ... the heights of hypocrisy.\n\nCongratulations on the baby! \u2665\ufe0f", "This is such a sad way to grow up. I'm so sorry you had to go through this. If there's any bright side to find in this horrible situation, I know you'll be an amazing parent. You grew up with a family of assholes and now you get to create your own family filled with love. Wishing you all the best! You made the right decision", "She made zero sacrifices. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t even call her mom. She did nothing an actual mother would do. \n\nI\u2019m sorry everyone was so shitty. \n\nI hope you and your girlfriend have a happy and healthy family. \n\nScrew your mom. She doesn\u2019t get to play grandma. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Whatever sacrifices she had to make were not because of you, but because of the choices she made\u2026", "NTA. I\u2019m proud of you, actually.  I think you\u2019ll be a good, loving dad.", "NTA block ker her and all the awful people. So sorry you went through that. Congratulations on the baby.", "NTA \n\nReading this made me so sad. I wish you weren\u2019t right\u2026but you\u2019re completely right that she should have placed you up for adoption to give you a better life. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had such a hard life, and you weren\u2019t given the love you deserved by\u2026*anyone*. I really hope your girlfriend and child are the family you\u2019ve always needed. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think just ignoring her calls, not saying why, and then telling her she was the worst was the best way to go about things with your mom. She probably reacted the way she did because she was hurt and shocked. You have every right to cut her out of your life, and to say what you said. But I understand why it was probably very jarring for her.\n\nThe weird thing is, though\u2026she *did* give up everyone else she loved for you. She lost her husband and your father. And then used you so she\u2019d get insulted less. So what does she mean you can\u2019t expect her to give up everyone she loved for you? Like, you\u2019re unfortunately right on her side too\u2014if she gave you up for adoption she might still be with her husband. I *hope* she lashed out because she still loves you and is afraid to lose you. Because you\u2019re all she has left. But it\u2019s hard to tell at this point, and it\u2019s valid you don\u2019t want her in your life.", "Your story is heartbreaking. I'm so sorry. Happy you've found a loving relationship to counter all the other shitty ones \n\nNTA of course, don't let your moms bs get to you. She made the decision to have an affair, whatever sacrifices she made she was supposed to make and none of it was your responsibility. You were an innocent child and are still innocent to this day. Surprised you didn't cut anyone out earlier and that not a single person realised the child was not to blame", "Nta", "What sacrifices? Is she calling the consequences of her own actions \"sacrifices\"? Laughable.", "nta. you dealt with it your whole life. block her from everything. tell her to get out of your life because she treated you like dirt.", "NTA. And [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UGhwxsIZg8)...", "I came here ready to be like adoption can be quite hard but sheesh, you didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. Congrats on the kid! You\u2019ll be a good parent", "She made no sacrifices. Sounds like she's created a completely new role for herself in the narrative in her head. Instead your childhood was plagued by cruelty and ignorance. I completely understand your desire for NC. If you wish to connect again, it needs to be on your terms and not hers and when/if you're ready.", "You are correct. It would have been better to be adopted by a loving family then to be around all those vile and hateful people. NTA and I'm sorry they made you go through this.", "NTA she actively put you in situations where you had to constantly face the resentment that all these people felt, when none of it was your fault. I think you\u2019re completely right, she knew that you would be seen as a physical manifestation of the break up of the family and all the vitriol would be directed at you. \n\nIt sounds like she would almost use you as a lure for that resentment so she could feel less guilty about her own actions. A child should never be put in that position and as a parent, she should have absolutely cut those people off if they were going to treat you like that. Part of parenting is putting your child\u2019s needs above your own and she clearly refused to do that, so not sure what sacrifices she made tbh.\n\nIdk if adoption would have been better though, not knowing you\u2019re biological parents can come with it\u2019s own issues and who knows what the adopted parents would be like.", "I am sorry you went through that. People should have protected you. YOU did nothing wrong. People taking out their anger and frustration on you was completely wrong. Your mother was wrong in not defending you. I hope you can have a good life now with your partner and child.", "NTA. Narcissistic mother if you ask me\u2026 I have one too. I\u2019m so sorry. Please remember your story is true and your emotions around it are healthy, valid, and make sense.", " NTA. I read a very similar story to yours a while back. The \u2018mother\u2019 made the same remark about \u2018making sacrifices\u2019 for that OP. I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing they told her. That woman gave up everything she had to open her legs for another man. And she used YOU as a meat shield to hide from her actions.", "No. NTA. Mom's TA. And yes, she definitely should have chosen you over everybody else. I can't imagine the pain you have gone through with the life you had, but you are far better off enjoying the little family you are having now.  Delete her out of your life. She never deserved you.", "NTA. In fact, you and your GF are the ONLY non-AH'S in this whole damned story. I am so sorry you were abused so badly and bore the brunt of your egg donor's actions. This is entirely on every single adult. Every one of them selfishly placed the blame on you- a child- rather than on the adults where it belonged. I would LOVE to know what 'sacrifices' that woman made for your sake, because it sounds like she's a coward who refused to take responsibility for her selfishness. \n\nYou and your GF be well. Be the parent you needed as a kid.", "NTA obviously. I'm so sorry for everything you went through. Keep your \"mom\" away from your gf and child.", "Preach!! This is so true - everything you said was spot on.\n\nI was born out of >!rape and incest!< and I cannot IMAGINE how I would be today if I was blamed for my fathers actions. This mother should be ashamed for leaving her child to take the fall for her.", "Ironic, considering that having an affair is basically tossing away your family and everyone around you for one new person.", "What would she have had to give up, anyway?  The charming families of herself and your father?", "She\u2019s objectively worse than lose she let abuse him. She repeatedly brought OP into these situations with no regard for OPs treatment so she could try and act like she never destroyed a family.", "I second this. You'll get to give your baby the childhood you never had!", "I'd give the 8 year old siblings a pass too. A child listening to their father blame another kid for a divorce is going to emulate that behaviour.", "Hey, OP, you're very much NTA.  And I'm so sorry your childhood was so bad.  I wish, as a mom, I could hug you.  I wish for you and your girlfriend and soon-to-be child all the love and support possible.  Congratulations on your family.  You're doing great.  <3", "NTA OP and I am truly sorry to read what you went through. Hear this from the internet stranger: you didn't choose to be born as a result of a relationship built on lies, betrayal and cheating. Don't let anyone tell you that you are a bad person because of two people who chose to cheat. If I am your neighbour or your boss, I'd judge you for your character not because of your past and origins\n\nOP, don't let your egg donor/mother guilt or manipulate you for establishing boundaries. You are not a bad person doing this but you also protecting your future child from whatever toxicity she may bring. As for your half siblings, your egg donor's family and your bio dad/sperm donor and his family, if they ever come looking for you, you have every divine right to slam the door on them and tell them they ain't welcome in your life\n\nMoving forward, you do your revenge by becoming the best person, spouse and dad you are, surround yourself with kind people, build your own family with people you trust in life and do better than your egg and sperm donors. Don't forget to seek therapy and I hope you find peace and healing\n\nGive us an update about you and I wish you all the best\n\nEdit PS: OP, may I suggest you put all your social media to private and block your egg donor or anyone associated/related to her so that she cannot know what you and your new family are up to. \n\nDo make sure you create a will to ensure that if anything untoward happens to you and your girlfriend, your future child/children would be raised by your girlfriend's family and the future child's appointed godparents so that your child/children will not end up in the custody of your egg donor in case your egg donor suddenly shows up demanding to raise the child/children\n\nWhen your future child/children are much older e.g. 18 years old, when you are ready to talk about your past, be honest with them and assure them that the misdeeds of your egg and sperm donors do not define you and them", "I think everyone else has established your NTA. So I don\u2019t need to go into that. But I wanted to say: this is a lot to process all at once, and it\u2019s perfectly normal if all of this has stirred up some old pain you thought you had moved on from. I think both expecting your own child and imagining the future you want to give them and your mother getting back in touch but not offering any apology would be a lot to process individually, but both at the same time is such a double whammy.\n\nEven if you think you\u2019re doing fine, I think that\u2019s a lot to go through all at once, especially since they\u2019re such interconnected topics. If you can swing it, I\u2019d encourage you to consider finding a therapist. It doesn\u2019t have to be a long term commitment and you don\u2019t have to feel like you\u2019re in crisis to seek out a professional. \n\nI know there\u2019s a stigma around seeking mental health resources, so I always tell people to think of their mental health the same way we think of our physical health. Some people think you only see a therapist when you\u2019re in serious crisis. That is a valid way to seek resources, but it\u2019s kinda like seeing an OT/PT after an injury. But you don\u2019t have to wait til you\u2019re injured to get health or strong! You can preventively work out and if you\u2019re not reaching your goals alone, you might seek out a personal trainer to create a plan! So too should we all be practicing good habits for mental health. And when we run into a bump in the road, it\u2019s best to find a coach *before* we\u2019re hospitalized and need emergency intervention. I will get off my soapbox now, but I just want to be clear: you\u2019re going through a lot and it\u2019s a really good idea to get some help to make sure you not only get through it, but are able to come back healthier and stronger. If not for yourself, than for your budding family, that you clearly love.\n\nI think you\u2019re going to be a great parent. I can already tell you want to protect your baby and give them everything you deserved but didn\u2019t get. Congrats on building a lovely family, and wishing you good fortune in welcoming them to the world!", "Same", "Right. She literally brought prey into the den\u2026 A sorry excuse for a woman!", "Being cheated on sucks but it\u2019s not an excuse to bully an innocent child.", "He said they're white, presumably in the US, I don't know a lot of white Hindus and Muslims, I'm sure they exist but come on, this screams Christian.  There's really good chance that that's what they are.  Get down off that high horse ok guy", "From the clues in OPs text, it's a fairly safe bet that they *are* Christian. But you make a fair point that it wasn't proven or specified.\n\nGenerally, there's a (statistically correct) assumption that when talking about 'religious' and conservative in the US, especially in the centre or South, there's a bible involved.\n\nUsually, on Reddit and other platforms, if it's something other than Christian, it's specified as such. \n\nGiven that's people's lived experience, I'd argue the 'very' in your 'biased'.\n\nETA: I didn't downvote you. Might I suggest that if you'd posed your comment as a question rather than a statement, it might have been taken better and actually thought about more? Do you see what I'm saying?", "I have Irish Catholic family one side and a long lost cousin who found us, 40+ years after my aunt and gave her up.(who is actually the only extended family who we regularly talk to as we're also black sheep)\nI don't think a single Catholic family lacks a tragic story like that if you go back enough.", "Most religious families will act like this to children born from those circumstances. Hell, most secular families probably would as well.", "Are you serious?  Roman Catholics are the ORIGINAL Christians!  We aren't \"Evangelical\" Christians, but we certainly are Christians.  How do you not know that?", "Much like people can be racist towards their own race, phobic towards their own identity, or sexist towards their own gender, being Catholic doesn't make you exempt from making anti Christian statements, especially given the fact that there's quite a few denominations under the Christian umbrella. \n\n\"And on the whole it tends to be Christians who react badly like this child family did. So sorry no\"\n\nThis is literally anti Christian. It's your own opinion, and still hasn't been validated by the OP.", "Cursing at the kid and calling him names is out of line and absolutely AH behavior", "Yeah, unfortunately the world is full of hypocrites", "I think you're misunderstanding the comment. They said they are not discriminating against Christians as they are Christian themself.", "Bahaha, as someone who was raised Catholic and had a child young and 'out-of-wedlock', as did my aunt (I kept mine, she adopted hers - we found him eventually), I can absolutely confirm there is a wide stripe of Catholics who condemned me and treated me badly for it. Not all, but many. My aunt was outcast by parts of the family for years (not by my folks, but definitely her parents, some siblings, and extended family - repairs were made, eventually). My immediate family copped it as well for supporting me. From other Christians!\n\nSome walk the talk. Some don't. Some misunderstand the talk entirely.\n\nAcknowledging that doesn't make someone inherently 'anti-Christian'."]}
