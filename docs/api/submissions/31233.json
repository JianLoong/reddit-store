My mom was married with three kids when she started an affair with another married man. I was born 2 years into the affair. My mom's ex-husband (husband at the time) found out I wasn't his kid and he filed for divorce and with the courts to establish he wasn't my father so he wouldn't be on the hook for child support for me. I'm biracial and my mom and her ex-husband were completely white while I have always looked like I was born to two black parents. So there was no denying that her husband was not my father.\n\nMy half siblings from my mom were all 8 and older when I was born. They were perfectly aware of the fact I was someone else's kid and not their dads and they hated me for it. I think to them if mom had just been cheating and I hadn't been born, their parents could have stayed together.\n\nDuring my childhood mom exposed me to her hypocritical religious family who despised me for being a child born out of wedlock, they treated it like a curse. I was exposed to her other kids who would tell me to my face I was repulsive and disgusting. To her ex-husband during their kids school events or games, etc. He would glare at me or curse at me and he called me names when I was around him. His family were there sometimes and they also hated me. Mom would also make sure we sat as close to them as we could and she would also grocery shop at the same time and place as them. She never supported me. Sometimes I feel like she brought me around these people because they hated me more than her and she could just sit there while I took all of their vocalized hatred. Mom did it way too often to not be something she was doing to make herself feel better in my opinion.\n\nShe also tried to bring me around my father's family and that went as well as it did with her own. They would shut the door in our face, I was called a bastard and affair baby, I was reminded every time we showed up that not one of them wanted me, not even him, and also not her family, either her kids or her parents and siblings.\n\nMy childhood was miserable and mom never cared to protect me. So when I went to college a few years ago I started distancing myself slowly until I no longer reached out to my mom. I never told her either. But she would call sometimes and I would ignore her.\n\nI have been with my girlfriend for more than 3 years now and we're expecting a baby. My mom found out through social media and tracked me down and showed up at my place and demanded to know why I shut her out and why I didn't even tell her about her grandchild. I told her she gave me a shitty childhood and she never seemed to care. She told me I couldn't expect her to toss away everyone else she loved just for me. That's when I told her she should have placed me for adoption then because it would have been better than growing up hated. She told me I would never understand the sacrifices she made for me and I should be ashamed to wish for that when I have a child on the way.\n\nAITA?

The reason I might be the asshole is I know my mom did keep me when many others would not have and because of that at least I know the truth about my biological parents and I don't have questions with no answers. Keeping me meant her kids hated her more. It meant she was always faced with what she did.

I'm guessing you made it clear she's not allowed around you or your family, ever, yes?", "NTA\n\nShe didn't protect you, she didn't advocate for you, she failed you.  She and your bio-dad are the guilty parties.  She should've shouted that from the rooftops.  You didn't choose how you were born or to whom.  You only had her to rely on and she failed you.  She chose everyone else over you who had no one", "NTA.  You made an honest and correct observation\n  She used you as a meat shield to try and protect the remnants of her destroyed life.  \n\nAdoption would have been kinder, or ya know, actually shielding her kid from stuff like that....", "NTA\n\nYou grew up in an environment where your emotional and mental health weren't protected and you were the figurative whipping boy for the anger and resentment felt toward your mother for her infidelity. She allowed you to endure the abuse so that she didn't have to, and that's abuse in and of itself. You not wanting her to have anything to do with you or your child is what a good parent would do and obviously an act your mother simply cannot recognize as it is a foreign concept to her.", "NTA. You spoke your truth to her. \n\nCongratulations on your coming baby and best wishes for the family you're building", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that, you most definitely did not deserve it. \n\nFor your sanity, stay NC with any and all of them. \n\nYou\u2019re about to have your own little family, cherish that.", "NTA. I'm really heartbroken for you. You mom failed you on every level. You are an adult now, living your own life, and should absolutely speak your mind to your egg donor. You may consider making the no contact permanent. There is really nothing she could offer you except more hurt and narcissism. Congratulations on your baby, I hope they feel all the love and support you deserved.", ">She told me I couldn't expect her to toss away everyone else she loved just for me.\n\nYea, you could have. You never asked to be born and dragged into her family drama from the get go. You were the only innocent in all this and she should have prioritized protecting you from the vitriol. She didn't have to toss away anyone she loved, just accept that everyone she loved tossed her away instead of forcing herself in their lives. What an ass.\n\nNTA go back to NC OP, you don't need this crap. And congrats to the baby.", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cmom\u201d is no better than all those she let abuse you. \n\nShe\u2019s a full blown narcissist and to make herself feel better about what she did, she made you the villain/pariah to exempt herself from taking accountability. \n\n\u201cIf I jump on the \u2018attack OP\u2019 bandwagon then the heat won\u2019t be on me\u201d \n\nYou have every right to keep her away from and protect yourself and your family, being subjected to her venom, her racism and prejudice. \n\nI wish you the best of luck moving forward and with your new baby!", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry OP. I hope you and your partner and baby have every happiness together.", "NTA. \n\nShe made no sacrifice. Don\u2019t let her even try that shit. \n\nShe failed you, epically and completely. She failed to protect you. She allowed you to take all the hate from everyone that should have been directed at her. She allowed her ex, his family, and her family to verbally abuse you - a child who had zero control of the situation. This was all her doing. \n\nCongratulations on your baby!", "NTA. It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t let you have a better family growing up. I\u2019m sure there were families out there who would have loved to adopt you and would have loved and protected you. Your mom sounds selfish and awful. She didn\u2019t sacrifice anything for you, she just was dealing with the repercussions of her own actions.", "NTA. She sounds like a shitty parent. She made sacrifices because SHE cheated. Her husband left her because SHE cheated. She never defended you, I'm so sorry for what you went through. Take care of your kid. Be the parent you never had. And your mom, if she wants to be in your child's life she should at least show some remorse and change her attitude towards you. Unless that happens, NC would be a viable option. Don't subject your kid to the same treatment.", "NTA.\n\nShe says she made sacrifices for you, but she didn't really. Her husband left because she chose to cheat. Her family, his family and your dad's family all hated her for her choices. Any hate her kids had for her, came from her own choices. She didn't move, change her shopping habits or try to build a community of trusted people for you to rely on despite her mistakes. She didn't leave you with friends or let you visit friends while SHE visited her family or saw her other kids.\n\nShe didn't discipline her kids for their misplaced anger at you. She didn't tell off ex-husband for what a dick he was for picking on an innocent child.  She didn't act like a MOTHER to you. She acted like someone glad to have a meat shield to take some of the anger and hatred for her so that she had someone to suffer with her.\n\nThere was a lot she could have ACTUALLY sacrificed and changed for you, but she never did.\n\nIt sounds like she was fine destroying as many lives as she could quite honestly, so why would you ever want her near you, your girlfriend or your child with how destructive she is and how miserable she seems to try to make absolutely everyone? \n\nShe got a LOT of adults to literally hate and pick on a child for an entire childhood. Giving you up for adoption would have been a lot kinder than purposefully exposing you to people that hated you repeatedly.\n\nKeeping you would have been selfless if she then ACTUALLY made sacrifices and took actions to protect you. But in not doing that, it was entirely selfish and involved a lot of needless suffering on your part so she could keep trying to be around people that hate her.\n\nYOU sacrificed YOUR entire childhood against your will so she could be the second most hated person in the room instead of the most hated.", "NTA  IF you don't want her in your life then that's how it is and she'll just have to deal with it!", "NTA.  My goodness what a wretched mother, and family in general.  \n\nGood job growing that shiny steel spine, despite their abuse.  \n\nEnjoy your happiness and give none of them any more or your time or energy!", "NTA.  I hope to goodness you get some therapy and put up some boundaries between you and your mother.  Said boundaries should probably include a moat.", "I do want to add that op this is because your mom is a bad mom. Being the product of an affair doesn\u2019t mean you get a shitty childhood based just on that. She didn\u2019t protect you. That has nothing to do with the affair", "NTA.\n\n'Sacrifices'.  I do not think that word means what you think it means...\n\nShe abused & abandoned you.\n\nWant to bet that without hacing YOU to kick around, your older half-sibs have ostracized & shunned her, maybe even deciding to NOT have kids just to spite her?", "NTA. Sorry you had to endure that kind of childhood. It sounds like you have a good life now and there is no reason these people have to be part of it.", "Your mother is a vile human being. NTA", "Your mother is  a narc and I am proud of you for standing up to her.  I get where you are coming from, I too was beaten repeatedly for being born.  \n\nYour mother all of a sudden wants to be included, don't include her, as she does not deserve it.  Protect your little family from that abuse, and let your little one grow up happy without all the hate and ignorance.  I would block her on social media too, so she gets nothing.  \n\nAdoption would have been easier and better on so many different levels.  Imagine being adopted by a family that wants you.  People that care and love you, and want you to succeed.  I have thought about that too, and how much better life would have been.\n\nUnfortunately, that did not happen.  But you have the chance to make your life great now, so do it, and don't ever look back.", "NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry they all treated you so badly :(.

And I hope you are happy with your partner and future child. \n\nYour mother did not protect you -she used you to shield her when her job was to protect you.  She does not deserve your consideration. You were right in what you said. None of this was on you and you bore the brunt. \n\nNTA.", "what 'sacrifices'? you said it yourself. she was almost certainly using you to take the heat off of her and her choices. she deliberately brought you around people who made it clear they hated you, time and time again. why would she expect you to be thankful for that?

Everyone else in this, though, except you and your gf... Oof.\n\nBe clear that you have severed this relationship, and with no relationship to you, she has no relationship with your child.  She is not going to be a grandmother to your children.\n\nDo what you need to for your own protection and to protect your family.", "NTA\n\nHer actions subjected you to all this and she doesn\u2019t care. Two and a half decades later she\u2019s still only worrying about how it effects her. All the other adults are ah too- your mom is the one who had the affair.", "I don't know what to say here. It is painful to read how an innocent child, with no control over the situation, became the punching bag for a pack of AHS. \n\nYour mother was the worst. I can't believe how she can go on with her life and be okay with herself\n\nKeep this toxic AH far far far away from you, your family and your child\n\nFocus on your amazing progress and your beautiful family\n\nso N.T.A.", "NTA, but everyone else was.

You deserved better.", "Maybe it's true, that you won't ever understand or see the sacrifices she made for you. That doesn't mean that you didn't experience what you experienced though.\n\nIt sounds like there is a lot of hurt, and a lot of healing that needs to be done.\n\nYou didn't make the choices here, except to say what you said, which is a response to all of the hurt you felt.

If you're not going to give your baby every ounce of love you can muster, either get an abortion or give up the child for adoption", "YTA for exactly the reason you mentioned in your explanation for why you think you might be TA.
