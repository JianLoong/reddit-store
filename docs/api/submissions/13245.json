While I don't generally think about intelligence because it's an easy way to end up placing people or yourself as inferior and cause confidence issues I would agree that I do see him as unintelligent because while he knows maths and physics, he only knows maths and physics. To be truly intelligent I think you should have a well rounded knowledge of important topics that you will come across in daily life, not just one single in depth topic, because everything interconnects. Part of that is exactly what you said, human connection is important especially when we go forward and look for work: connections will be almost everything in finding good work and someone who's intelligent, can apply themselves, is resourceful and personable will be favoured. This is what our school is teaching us, they are preparing us to be intelligent and go into good jobs and they teach us that how we carry ourselves and are perceived by others is crucial", "Exactly! I didn't think it was that important to my previous comment, so I didn't include it, but overall intelligence is more complex and devided into multpiple categories: trivia, emotional, artistic, linguistic, mathematic, ... It's not as black and white your \"friend\" makes it out to be.", "I'll definitely be showing our group your comments, it's so well put! They all understand but as a gaggle of linguists we appreciate a well put together point. We would argue that we are an intelligent group, because we value almost everything there is and desire to better ourselves in all the categories you listed, curious minds y'know", "Honestly looking at its history, it did do a better job than most of picking relatively insightful things to say. Maybe theoretically AI-driven copy bots could be constructive to discussions like this, if they weren\u2019t eventually also going to be used by their controllers to steer opinion from behind the scenes.", "I'm trying to reply to most of the comments so I noticed! But I couldn't find the original comments and it's definitely a comment that stuck with me", "You\u2019re asking if you\u2019re an AH for not allowing an actual AH to come to your party and insult everyone he talks to? No. You\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re a good friend because you want to do what\u2019s best for those you care about (those who aren\u2019t d*cks to everyone, anyway). Also, *thank you* for being one of the few autistic people who post on this sub to actually acknowledge that autism isn\u2019t an excuse to be an AH. (Maybe more do than I think, I just mostly see posts by those who use it as an excuse then have the gall to ask if they were an AH.) Keep being a good person and don\u2019t let anyone influence you into changing what you\u2019re doing.", "Mother of one neurodivergent person, and aunt to another.   I 100% agree with this sentiment.  Autism is a thing you have, not who you are.  Autism doesn't make you an asshole.  Being an asshole makes you an asshole.\n\nYou NEVER owe anyone an invite to your party.  It's literally a party for you, by you, to celebrate your life.  The real asshole can go sit in his corner and cry while you party down OP.\n\nOf course, NTA.", "Thank you! I'm glad to know I acted appropriately in the situation, and I agree he's a pretty big jerk", "Thanks for your vote! \n\nAnother commenter put it right, he isn't a friend he's an acquaintance. I dislike him and its no secret that the rest of the group doesn't like him either. I won't speak for the whole group, but I will tell him when he's out of order and he doesn't usually want to attend my activities (im quite outdoorsy and enjoy art and fashion exhibitions, he doesn't care for any of that) so I've never had to tell him he isn't welcome at anything I'm planning and I'm not his friend before, it isn't lost in me how silly of an argument \"your not coming to my birthday party!\" Is", "Thank you for your vote! \n\nI try my best to look after my friends! I care for these people and the ones I've invited are the ones who also care for me and will be respectful of other guests.\nI'm not a major reddit user, I love reading drama and gossip so gravitate towards twitter and Instagram more but I assume the terminally online people from twitter also come over here and act as though every autistic needs babied. Some of us are also taught its a free pass, as a child I was a terror because everything was met with \"he's autistic! He doesn't know any better\" until I lived with my granny who taught me that I do, in fact, know better. And thank you, I won't let anyone who's an asshole tell me how to be a good person (that's like taking advice on flying from a goldfish lol ) :)", "My kid (20NB) is most definitely on the spectrum and although an introvert, they're incredibly kind in social situations, and can definitely hold their own when engaging in conversation with others without being a dick. They might not be as comfortable or in their element perse, but most people wouldn't have a clue that they're on the spectrum.", "I have definitely met some extroverted Autistic people. That\u2019s definitely a bad stereotype.", "Thank you! I'm happy to here that most people who parent ND kids agree, since I don't have my own mum to ask anymore, and my dad is reliable to say \"you do what you want and don't care about others\". \n\nIt's such a silly fight to have, \"you're not invited to my birthday party!\" Last time I had it I might have been like 6 or something. I feel like my autism is only really relevant in two situations: when I'm meeting either other NDs to talk about how it's affecting us and when I'm saying Xs \"you can't disagree I'm autistic\" argument doesn't work on me because 1. I don't care and 2. I'm also autistic.\n\nI only felt somewhat unsure about banning one person when the whole thing was open to 100s of people I like", "Youre welcome! :)", "Good for your granny! Sounds like a woman who knows what\u2019s up.", "From my experience, im great at conversation but sometimes I'm accidentally a little mean and I don't mean it and i think i was being appropriately honest, my friends will tell me when I miss a social cue or am a dick and I can apologise and we move one but X just won't admit any wrongdoing which is what annoys me about him, he always has an excuse such as \"but art is useless\" or \"she was wearing something revealing\" which aren't even valid excuses! Wishing you and your kid the best!!", "There's tons of us! And we all seem to have the same experience of our experiences being invalidated because we don't fit the stereotype. Stereotypes are so bad! (Except white people liking cheese, because we all do love cheese haha my Chinese friend thinks its hilarious to offer us cheese because we always get so excited about it)", "She definitely did, one of the best people I've ever met! I just wish everyone had a granny like her", "Thank you! I hope so too :)", "I\u2019m not Autistic but when I could work I didn\u2019t always catch I was being really harsh with people. The difference is when someone corrected me, I apologized. There were times I knew I was being harsh because I did it purposely when people refused to listen and work (I was an Assistant Manager). Those are the few times I refused to apologize and the boss usually backed me up!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. I have to agree about cheese. I love cheese and I am white! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "And that's a reasonable way to be harsh! You're doing your job and apologising when wrong, very respectable things", "It's just a true fact \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "> Autism is a thing you have, not who you are\n\nHard disagree. I don\u2019t *have* autism. I *am* autistic. It\u2019s not something I live with, it\u2019s part of who I am. However, that doesn\u2019t excuse me from behaving like an asshole.", "I think you hit the nail on the head. Unfortunately, in the current \u201cwoke\u201d climate, people are to scared to speak up for fear of backlash or being labeled with ableism. They don\u2019t realize the harm it actually does to the ND communities. \n\nHe absolutely needs to be called out by everyone, though I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help his behavior or not.", "It might help to frame it as a safety issue. If a guy stares at my chest, I'm going to feel threatened. I'm going to play it safe and assume he's willing to do more if he gets the chance. If his friends also appear to be okay with him staring at my chest, I'm going to assume they also aren't safe to be around. Even if they never catch him in the act, I'm going to assume that someone who is a creep around women also talks to his friends about women in a creepy way; so by being his friend, again, they're showing me they condone that kind of behavior and may be unsafe for me too.", "NTA. by denying him entry you're actually protecting your friends. If I were your friend, especially as a female, I would give you a big hug for looking out.", "X 6", "Absolutely NTA!! He's using the autism as an excuse to be horrid and guilt trip you! Bin him i hope he doesn't show!!", "NTA he sounds mean and grubby, I wouldn't want him at the party either. He just doesn't sound like a positive person all around. Thinks he's smarter than everyone else, biased against people with popularity like they're out to get him specifically, leers at girls, blames problems on neurodivergency and he's an incel. Nope, he doesn't need to be at the party, he needs to go touch grass.", "YTA. Just tell him you hate him and get it over with. Must be hard for you being so popular.", "Since it's your birthday you get to decide on how this party goes. If you decide you don't want to have someone who uses excuses just so they can freely be a huge a-hole come that's your call.\n\nYou're totally NTA\n\nHe has clearly shown he can't play well with others.\n\nEnjoy your birthday! Happy birthday!"]}
