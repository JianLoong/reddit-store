Being 19, I would advise you to learn from now something that has helped me into adulthood and that is letting go of those who are weighing you down. If a friend can\u2019t be behind you pushing forward and uplifting you, they can at least be by your side. This individual isn\u2019t doing either. Time to learn to let them go\u2026", "Thank you, its just so unnecessary like just admit you're an asshole! He doesn't believe I'm autistic because I'm not a socially awkward introvert, he just believes all of us should be like him or the stereotype of autistic people or were fakers", "Same here dude those people are the worst. I dont like people knowing I'm neurodivergent or queer cause they always put me in a box or assume I subscribe to the typical mob mentality. The worst is being lumped in with Tiktok self-diagnosers", "Thank you, and he truly is. If it was up to just me I'd kick him out the group, thankfully I'm not the one looking to live with him next year though: I will not have that behaviour in my house, I was raised better", "Thank you, I feel like claiming ableism works on too many of my friends here and they don't want to call him out like I will", "Thank you, I wish I wasn't and I've been on the receiving end from him before. He'd put me down as stupid until I consistently proved myself as better than him at trivia (trivia! I just do so much I know all the answers). \n\nMost people at our uni are afraid of being irl cancelled if they stand up, I am not like that and even if I wasn't also autistic I still wouldn't stand for this. My mum didn't raise me to facilitate the bullying of my friends if I can intervene in a non-violent way. \n\nAnd if he does make a scene that won't bother me, ill handle it when it happens, he absolutely cannot be a bigger drama queen than me about it", "Thank you, I definitely agree. And if he thinks being a misogynistic jerk is staying true to himself, I'll stay true to myself and continue to not invite misogynistic jerks to things!", "Thank you, I'll definitely consider that. It already seems to be affecting other people in the group, I've already established a reputation for being a safe guy to be friends with for girls but other friends say girls are hesitant to befriend them or go out with them in case they're creeps. The last thing I want is this guy making people feel like I'm not a safe person to befriend", "Thank you, I think the same way about it. I can stand the idea of someone making my friends uncomfortable and not doing anything.", "Thanks for your vote and proximity mostly, I say \"friend\" because he's in one of my groups but I don't know another word to call him. I really wish he was not part of this group though", "At first I tried to be nice and accommodating, starting uni in a new place is hard and I know people struggle especially when they're introverts but serious sexism isn't autism and like 99% of our problems with each other are the fact I won't see that as a free pass to be an ass like others do. But he won't change if he doesn't want to, and he certainly doesn't", "Thank you, I agree! I'm very good at masking so most people don't realise I'm also autistic, same with quite a few people I know and the amount of NTs who talk about good and bad autistics is shocking, its just good or bad people nothing to do with the autism. Currently the autism card works too well though on people who are afraid it'll get them cancelled or whatever so I'm the only one who will tell him he's an asshole, which is better than no one imo. Just wish our NT friends would say that to his face rather than bitch behind his back", "Another commenter put it better, he's an acquaintance not a friend. And the introvert thing was relevant to a point that I removed, about why I have more friends. Removed it because I, being a stem major, know the introverted stem majors who have lots of friends because they aren't assholes.", "Thanks for your vote, Im pretty sure hell try to come but I live in a flat and I'll let the security guy know I might need him to kick someone out but I think everyone will be watching since it was a public convo", "Thank you, that is the way I see it. I am confident enough in myself that his attempts to bully me didn't do anything however I don't want anyone that his bullying would affect to have a bad day on my birthday! Telling him he's a bully has been ineffective because he views me as one, which I'm sure is because I won't let myself or my friends be bullied and I am a fan to the \"taste of your own medicine\" method of dealing with him, he makes fun of me for a mistake I'll make fun of him right back when he makes one. That does kind of make me an asshole but I know that already and it makes him leave me and my friends alone", "It's only cruel to 1 person if you don't invite him it's cruel to literally everyone else if you do.", "Good for you for not inflicting this dude on your friends to avoid the awkwardness with him. \n\nAlso, if being your \u201ctrue to yourself\u201d involves staring at women\u2019s chests and treating non-STEM majors like idiots, then don\u2019t be true to yourself.", "That's ridiculous; being autistic does not give you license to be a complete ass. \n\nNTA; it's your birthday party, and as such, you don't have to invite anyone you don't want to, and it sounds like this guy has given you plenty of reasons to not want him around.", "Acquaintance. That\u2019s what this person is to you. Friends are the people you seek out to spend your time with. Acquaintances are on the periphery. Regardless, if the presence of this one person will throw off the vibe of the night, it\u2019s best they aren\u2019t present. Have a good time and be safe out there!", "I wonder what he'd say if you sent him this post and he saw the comments. Maybe from now on rather than give him a taste of his own medicine just look at him like he's an asshole for all and any of his behavior and say geez dude you're a dick this is why I don't want you around.", "Underrated comment here", "Thank you! I'm glad most people think I was fair", "Thank you, that is a better way to tell them apart I think. And I will!"]}
