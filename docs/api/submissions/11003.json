My three sisters (aged 26, 22, and 35) and I (30F) are planning a family trip on a Disney Cruise. We're all very excited about it, and we've been planning for weeks to make sure everything goes smoothly.\n\nOne of the main shore excursions we had planned was a tropical helicopter tour, which I was really looking forward to. Unfortunately, my oldest sister is extremely overweight and cannot fit into the helicopter. We contacted the tour company, and they informed us that the weight limit was non-negotiable for safety reasons. It's a bummer, but we can't risk anyone's safety.\n\nMy sister is now upset and saying that I should have chosen a shore excursion that we could all participate in, instead of excluding her. However, I don't think it's my responsibility to make sure everyone can participate in every activity. I didn't intentionally leave her out, and I can't control her weight. I feel terrible that she can't join us, but it's not my fault.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for not accommodating my overweight sister on our family Disney Cruise trip?", "created_utc": 1677460300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cyogb/aita_for_excluding_my_obese_sister_from_our/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think it's fair to you that you should be prevented from doing things you want to do because of someone else's disability - and let's be clear, in this context, that's what obesity is. But that said, you needed to do better at setting things up in a way which were not obviously exclusionary. Sometimes, we accept that things are unfair for the benefit of those we care about.\n\nConsider this: If your sister was blind, rather than obese, would you have scheduled the helicopter tour for her? No, because she wouldn't have been able to enjoy it, right? So why is it any different in this situation? The point of the vacation is to do things you can *all* enjoy. If you wanted to do something extracurricular that was just for you, that's fine, but it shouldn't be the main attraction of a whole day.\n\nI think you need to find something else to do with the time, and eat the fact that you won't get to do the helicopter tour this time around. Maybe find a time when you can leave, be the odd one out, and go do it, if it is really important to you - but don't make the rest of the family suffer, and certainly not your sister.\n\n(Note: Lots of people are gonna show up being \"well, obesity is a choice and blindness isn't.\" First of all, no, it's not a \"choice\" in the way people think. Second of all, even if it was, that doesn't change the situation on the ground.

It makes sense on a family trip to at least try to do things everyone can do, or at least have it be a general consensus, so I do kind of think it IS the person planning responsibility to at least try to accommodate everyone. Because being together is the whole point, isn\u2019t it? That being said if you all really want to go on a helicopter ride and she can\u2019t go I think she should try to be gracious about it since it is a shame to hold others back.

Enjoy yourself, and let her pick the next outing.", "You're N T A for wanting to go on a helicopter tour, but yes, ultimately YTA because you're doing the planning. I was recently on a group trip in which an excursion was planned that had a weight limit. Three of us were at or over the limit, so we were automatically out. Plus, it involved heights, and there were a few others who didn't go because they are afraid of heights. \n\nIt sucked. It was a large group, so you can't please everyone, but also, to have it be something where you're automatically excluded from something that you want to do but can't because of your size really sucks.

It wouldn't be excluding her to go because she's still going with you, she would just have to skip some activities.

So long as you aren\u2019t excluding the same people repeatedly (especially intentionally), it\u2019s simply the nature of varied interests and abilities vacationing together.", "If that's correct, it's on the edge. I see your perspective. But I think, as OP's sister, it would suck a lot to be alone on an island for three hours without the people I'm ostensibly spending time with. Plus there's travel time, etc.", "Again, if it\u2019s one freaking activity then why can\u2019t they decide to donsomething equally as exciting for everyone? It\u2019d be a little different if 2 people were excluded, they could go do something together. But no, 1 person will be left out and not get to experience something they also wanted to because they physically unable.  \n\nThat\u2019s the equivalency of having 4 friends go out, one is under 21 and can\u2019t go into the club so they just get left outside because everyone else really wanted to try the mixed drinks?? Pretty fucked.", "Yes. OP really wants to do this so there shouldn\u2019t be an issue with sister figuring out something else to do for half a day because she\u2019s physically unable to do that ONE excursion. When you\u2019re the one with limitations, it\u2019s selfish to expect everyone else to only do things you\u2019re capable of doing.", "And none of those are the equivalent- we\u2019re not talking about the sister wandering off for 10 minutes, she\u2019s not allowed into the theme park and they\u2019re all happy to leave her at the gate.", "Not condescending. Been in the same boat (get it, wink wink) as OP's sister. I knew to a degree, but it snuck up on me all the same and it took a confronting moment for me to start working on myself.\n\nAs for your assertion that she \"knows\" how much she's missing, why is she so upset? Surely she'd just shrug it off and let her sisters pursue something they have expressed as a really big want?", "she\u2019s not obese to spite them. jesus fucking christ. would you feel the same if they invited grandma but then insisted on going snorkeling even though grandma can\u2019t and there are alternative options that wouldn\u2019t exclude her? what if the sister was in a wheelchair instead of fat, would it be okay if they chose an exclusionary activity? i really don\u2019t get it. i would have trouble enjoying myself if i knew someone i love feeling left out.", "They are not excluding her the whole trip or even the whole day. Who says when you go on trips with family members that you have to spend every moment together? Her weight is not their problem and they are paying for the trip so they should get to enjoy the activities that they want to do. If I was told I couldn't do something because of my weight, I wouldn't stop others from enjoying stuff. There are other things the sister can do.", "it\u2019s one activity on a cruise vacation. they have plenty of time to hang. she\u2019ll be fine sitting one activity out \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "The best part of family trips as adults is that you don't have to be together all the time. They are traveling as a family, that's what makes it a family trip. It's a couple hours out of a cruise that the one sister will have to find something to do.", "The overweight sister isn't on here, so no one's eyes are being opened by rude comments.", "Piggybacking another question in the same vein, how many chances does OP get to make priceless memories with all the siblings in one place? How many chances does OP get to truly be a person of character and stick up for everyone when at the helm of a family experience? Idk. I absolutely would not let this happen to my loved one. In fact, I\u2019d go out of my way to make sure they never knew it was an issue.", "Then why do you think there\u2019s a difference between the limitation being obesity vs. wheelchair user?", "Yeah I don't care about that blame game stuff, that wasn't what I was getting at. My point was that weight combined with aircraft is a completely different thing since weight and harnesses are things to be considered in aircraft, especially light ones. Ergo I don't see the relevance of the comparison", "You can\u2019t gain weight without eating. So they were either sneaking or were not counting food. \n\nBariatric surgery literally just limits the amount of food you can eat (or absorb). It\u2019s not magic.", "my understanding is that they went ahead and booked it without talking to her.\n\nfrom my point of view: my sister doesn't eat meat. let's say I was booking things for a family trip, and when calling a restaurant to make a reservation (even one I was really excited to go to), if I realized that they didn't have any meatless options, I would hang up & call my sister. I'd ask her how she felt about the rest of us going to this restaurant one night without her, and if that would make her sad. if she was fine with it, I'd call back and book the table. if she said it would bum her out, I'd figure out a plan B because our family only gets limited time together, and her feeling sad and excluded during said trip isn't worth it to me. \n\nIn OP's case: I could be swayed if the helicopter trip is a lifelong dream, and/or classifies as a meaningful once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for OP.", "Life sucks. Three people having to miss out on the adventure of a lifetime in order to accommodate one person for a few hours over the course of a long vacation sucks way more.\n\nThere are people who backpack around the world solo for months at a time and see some amazing shit. The sister can have an incredible tour of her own or simply chill on the beach for a few hours, whatever. She doesn't need to hold her siblings' hands for the entire trip in order to have a great experience.", "Except this is a whole trip with multiple activities that will be done, not a one night club run. They will be doing plenty of other activities together, just that this one she will have to sit out. Using your analogy, that\u2019s like going to the club every night for a week and your friend doesn\u2019t go for one of the nights. Pretty doable.", "Simply because it\u2019s one activity that all three of them really want to do. It\u2019s unfair for all three sisters to miss out on an activity that takes a few hours because one sister can\u2019t go. Again all three sisters really want to go. I\u2019d feel worse being the reason I held people back from doing something they really wanted to do rather than being left to my own devices on a cruise where there\u2019s plenty to entertain me. When I\u2019m pregnant I don\u2019t demand no one eats sushi, or drinks around me, or ride roller coasters etc. It just seems really unfair to me that three out of four sisters should miss out on something they really want to do because one sister can\u2019t. It\u2019s also not their fault she can\u2019t go, it\u2019s literally a safety issue", "We don't know what else is planned so can't say this is the one excursion sister will be left out of.", "Your analogy doesn't make sense. They are traveling in the theme park. The 3 sisters are going on a ride. The remaining sister has the entire port and the cruise ship to explore, and she could look into other excursions she could do during that time. It's not as if she's being left out of the entire trip or has nothing to do while her sisters are gone.\n\n\nAlso, you are funny if you think lines at Disneyland are 10 minutes.", "People can\u2019t be upset about their sister abandoning them if they\u2019re aware it\u2019s happening? That makes zero sense.", "It's at least half a day with travel time that sister will be left alone. It's mean.", "Half a day is a long time to be alone on a family trip.", "Very selfless of you, but completely unnecessary. Sister can be a grown up and do something else while they do the tour. Very likely a once in a lifetime event for them.", "Obese people usually don't have a condition making them fat . So I sympathize more with a person in wheel chair but ill do what i want either way", "i think it\u2019s a remarkable lack of empathy to consider weight to not be a \u201cphysical, fixed limitation well out of any form of control.\u201d\n\nfor one thing, that\u2019s definitely not the case for all wheelchair users, nor for all obese people. for another, regardless of your personal opinion on whether or not obesity is \u201ccontrollable,\u201d her sister is not going to be able to make serious changes before the trip. ergo, the OP\u2019s comparison holds, except, again, i think the world is *more* hostile to fat people (particularly fat women) than wheelchair users, and that your comments illustrate that fairly well.", "Here let me make it a little better for you then \n\nThat\u2019s the equivalency of 4 friends going on a cruise and when they get to their shore excursion 3 friends wanna go out to a club because they really want to try the mixed drinks. But 1 is under 21 and can\u2019t go in. There are plenty of activities though, so it\u2019s okay that they\u2019re excluded and didn\u2019t get to enjoy something everyone else did.", "Based on OP struggling with this one excursion I think we can assume it\u2019s the only time. IF it\u2019s a regular thing on the trip it\u2019s an issue, but there is no indication that\u2019s the situation and that\u2019s not what OP asked AITA for judgement. The question is whether she\u2019s the ahole for one excursion that sister can\u2019t do due to her weight. On that narrow issue, she is NTA.", "Omg...she is the oldest sister at 35, she will be fine. I have traveled with family and gone out on my own, or they did their own thing. Seriously, they shouldn't have to plan all activities around the sister and her weight. Again, they are paying for this trip and have a say on what they want to do also.", "The trip is a cruise trip, which is long already. Half a day is nothing. Go take a nap or something\nEdit: the sister should go nap is what I\u2019m implying", "Well, I guess I'm just a cold, evil person for not agreeing with the concern troll who thinks obese people have zero agency, who plucks a handful of weak anecdotes to try and speak for all obese people. Move along if you're only here to make thinly veiled stabs at me.", "But they're still jerks", "Ya, no. They can't control her weight. Only the sister can. And if you are overweight to the point that you can't do some activities, that isn't anyone else's fault. So why should others have to lose out just because someone who is overweight can't do something?"]}
