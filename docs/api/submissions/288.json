This could lead to the controlling bf lashing out at your bf or you for that matter thinking that they have something going on.  Now, you can certainly tell him  you are uncomfortable with their relationship and that you would prefer he stop. It's ultimately up to him as to whether he will or not.  Depending on his choice you will need to make a decision  regarding your relationship.", "Regardless of what Reddit's verdict is, you have a bigger problem.  It is your BF that is enabling her behavior, and he wants to be there for her.  The two of you will need to  come up with a compromise that you both can live with.    \n\n\nEither way - NTA.", "Yta. Not necessarily for the way you feel, but for trying to dictate his life. It's HIS choice whether or not he wants to speak to the mother of his kids. It's HIS choice to decide the boundaries of their conversation, not yours. If you plan on a future with this man, YOU need to grow up and encourage him to have a healthy and positive relationship with her for the sake of their kids. If your own insecurities or drama is a barrier to that, stay out of it completely. Keep this up and you're gonna either lose him or put unnecessary road blocks between him and his children. (Yes, causing tension between mom and dad is harmful to the kids.) When you decide to pursue a relationship with someone who is a parent, you gotta wear your big girl pants and be ready for everything that comes with that.", "INFO:\n\nHow long ago did they date and how old is their child?", "I don't think anyone is TA. \n\nYour feelings are valid especially because of her poor treatment of you during the past year and that fact that they haven't been broken up very long and your relationship is still new. You want to feel like the priority.\n\nHowever, your BF has a very small child with this woman who is exposing that child to a possibly violent/unsafe situation. Due to that, your BF should keep contact with this woman to determine if he needs to remove his child from her house.  Just think of his contact with her as a way to keep his child safe. If she is already pregnant with another man's baby, I don't think there is any chance of him going back to her.", "Sorry, but yes, YTA. For one very specific reason...you are his GF, not his owner. You absolutely do not get to dictate how he spends his time or his emotional efforts.", "YTA. \n\nBF is 30.

I don't think I'd have as strong feelings if SHE was wanting to be there for HIM.

I should have worded it better that I've told him these are my feelings instead of making it sound like \"do as I say.\"", "That's fair. He is an adult. Best I can do is tell him how I feel and let him decide from there?", "The issue still remains that your BF seems okay with it.  He's allowing it to happen. I think some people said it kind of harshly here. I don't think you're controlling, I can see your concern. Maybe your heart is in the right place, but he's a grown man. If it doesn't bother him, the only question you have to ask yourself is are you willing to let this be the status quo for the rest of your life?", "I dunno, man. I think it's weird for someone in their late 20s to date someone in their early 20s. There's a big difference in maturity, brain development and life experiences in those few years. I also think if my ex was caring for my child that I'd have a vested interest in making sure she is safe.\n\nThere's also a big difference between not caring about your ex's current partner of less than a year and caring about your partner who is in a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nSo I guess ESH", "Meh don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.
