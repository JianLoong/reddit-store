This was our first, and likely only, trip here.\n\nOn the fifth night we went to Hollywood Studios and at the end of the day we sat on the front row (barring some short extra rows for disabled folks) to watch the evening show, Fantasmic.\n\nAfter we sat down as a family, two women and a young girl (I'd guess around 8 years old) sat behind us. Despite only being 5' 8\", I'm always conscious of blocking someone's view, and since the child was behind me, I spent the entire show bent over to keep put of the way, grinning and swapping the odd word with my 6 year old.\n\nThe problem began when the young girl behind me began to sing along very loudly. She actually had a decent voice for a child and I thought to myself \"loud, but fair enough.\"\n\nThen the women with her started going \"you go girl\" and \"get it girl\" to her, and she really began to bellow. It will seem rediculous, but she hit a volume I could never achieve at my angriest. As it was a bit much, and my little one was being forced to sit with his fingers in his ears, I began to turn to speak to them and ask that they tone it down a little. \n\nHowever, just as I turned, this little girl screamed her head off to the point that it made my ear drums react with a weird zipping noise and I said, quite loudly (to be heard over the music) \"oh, hey! Bit loud!\" I said as I spun around, to find the little girl less than a foot from the back of my head. She shot back into her seat, and I turned back to my children, still bent over to keep out of the way.\n\nOnce the show ended I received a frantic tapping on my shoulder, accompanied with \"Sir, sir, sir...\" I turned around and the mother of the child demanded to know if I'd shouted at her child. I repeated the words I'd said and she informed me that no one has the right to talk to her child but her, and that I'd ruined her little girls night.\n\nI feel shit. I had intended to speak to the women when I turned, but the sudden scream in my face just caused my to speak directly at the little girl.

If her kid can go full volume a foot away from your ear, you get to speak up at a volume necessary to be heard. My guess is that the kid got over it in .03 seconds but 'my baby can do anything she wants' mamma got her feathers ruffled.", "NTA that was inappropriate and obnoxious. I have misophonia, and I would have yelled too. You didn\u2019t curse or lunge at her. If mom had been parenting instead of acting like a pageant mom, none of that would\u2019ve happened.", "NTA.  In general, I don't think it's appropriate to yell at someone else's kids.  But I make an exception in this case for three reasons:\n\n1)  This kid was yelling less than a foot from your head, to the point that it was affecting your own sense of hearing.  When something is at that level, I think you **have** to say something to the kid direclty rather than wait for their parent to do something.  \n\n2)  The kid was (again) yelling.  You probably had to raise your own voice just to be heard.  \n\n3)  You didn't go on an extended tirade against the kid.  \"Oh, hey! Bit loud!\" is a rather mild rebuke.", "NTA. The other kids mom is TA. There\u2019s a fine line between letting your kid be a kid and letting them \u2018run wild\u2019 and even encouraging that. Sucks that you were in that position and had to say something. But don\u2019t give it another thought, most of us would\u2019ve done the same thing. Probably helps the other kid understand boundaries that they are clearly not given at home.", "NTA. You didn't wait for good seats at that show to hear some kid scream sing behind your head. It was rude of her parents to allow that. Light singing is fine, kids are excited. But that was beyond the pale. And the only reason you raised your voice was to match hers.", "NTA. \n\nThe proper response would be \u201cIf you don\u2019t want people speaking to your kid like that, then try parenting them and teaching them some manners.\u201d", "NTA. As someone who has really sensitive hearing I completely understand your anger. Parents need to teach their kids to behave even at loud places because their kids can still be too loud. When you said what you yelled out it seemed like the most polite way of putting it and that mother should get some sense instead of cheering on their kid for everything. That\u2019s how ungrateful personalities start.", "I would say No Assholes here. \n\nIt did sound super annoying but you did, unintentionally or not, yell at a child when you could have just spoken to her guardian. Her guardian was just looking out for her kid. You were just rightfully annoyed. We all have bad moments both you and the guardian. I wouldn't lose sleep over this.", "you know there\u2019s kids at Disney right? You have your own, so you should know how to be patient with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sometimes interactions don\u2019t go the way we planned but you didn\u2019t mean it to happen like that. And as a regular Disney goer, there are some really entitled people and they don\u2019t care how they affect others and they don\u2019t teach their children to be mindful of others either. Unfortunate, but true", "The other parent is an AH no one should be screaming a foot from someones head at a show", "He was pretty patient for a while. Don\u2019t confuse patience with being a doormat. \n\nAlso the kids old enough to understand reasonable public behavior. It wasn\u2019t a 2 year old. If they can\u2019t deal with a stranger reacting to ridiculous screaming, they\u2019re really going to struggle as they get older. That\u2019s peak undisciplined child behavior, as evidenced by the woman tell her to \u201cget it girl\u201d despite being the loudest person in the vicinity.", "NTA. What an obnoxious kid and mom.", "NTA. The kid was screaming in your ear, you stopped it. Nobody has the right to yell in your ear, even that woman's spawn.", "And thats when you tell her, her little spawn ruined you night as well. Even Elsa and Arieal knew to keep the volume down\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \nI've been to the very same situation. We've been visiting a show and a child and his parents were sitting right behind us. The child was screaming loudly and it was kicking at the backs of our chairs. The child was quite young (around 6-8 years i'd guess) and the show was late in the evening.\n\nI tried talking to the adults which accompanied the kid. However, the just snapped and bawled out at me. \"It's just a small child.\"  \"Don't say anything more or I'll come after you.\"\n\nI guess entitled parents do not care and are not open to any kind of criticism. \n\nAnd: \n\nThe child did ruin your night. Is a little child's night more valuable than yours?\\`", "Nta. That woman had no right to aggressively tap on your shoulder for that ridiculous reason. Tbh kids shouldnt sing out loud especially if it\u2019s a performance anyway. Like sing softly why dont you? Isnt there such thing as theater etiquette? Her mom didnt teach her that and that\u2019s how they become rude entitled people", "NTA of course venues that cater to children are expected to be a bit louder, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok for kids to just go around shrieking, shouting, screaming, or yelling all the time.", "No one has the right to talk to her child but her? Well you\u2019re letting her scream in my ear so do your job. \n\n\nDon\u2019t feel shit, parents get super entitled about their kids.", "Very slight and accidental YTA\n\nThe mum is right: you should have spoken to her about her child\u2019s behaviour and it seems like that was your intention but you\u2019ve still terrified a little kid at Disneyland", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46100%\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46"]}
