Included is her bf (23M)\n\nI know being a new mom is hard (I've had many sleepless nights myself, taking her at least 3 nights a week) and one of the reasons I moved in was to help with all the extra things like cleaning and taking care of my niece\n\nFor the 1st month, I did all chores and house work (including cleaning up after them after they left a pack of trulys and wine bottles scattered around the living room 5/7 days), dishes, baby's laundry, trash, cleaning kitchen, bathroom etc\n\nI asked for simple things; not using my dishes (they did, then asked to use them but not cleaning them like agreed) or breaking down recycling instead of tossing it near the corner, not putting dirty dishes on drying mat, etc\n\nEverything a bad roommate could do, they did. I clean the litter box for my 2 cats plus their 2 cats, neither of them have touched it. They got a kitten a week before my niece was born and they've done nothing but feed it once in awhile\n\nI stopped doing the majority, hand washing my dishes and not cleaning their bathroom or the kitchen unless I used it, etc. I still did anything baby for another 2 months, occasionally bulk cleaning the house. My sister helped now and then, but her bf has rarely done any chores\n\nI finally stopped doing baby chores 2 weeks ago; her bottles sit dirty for days-weeks (her tummy issues have been so bad. She only has a clean bottle when I wash one, all 4 months) in a sink so full that I have to do jenga to wash my own. Her laundry has sat, and she only has clean clothes bc I pulled the next size up out of her storage. Her nursery is unusable. The diaper genie ran out of refills, they used it anyway and I had to clean it and put a trash bag in. The kitchen trash was so overfilled that chicken bones were scattered around the kitchen.\n\nMy sister was badgering me what was wrong (I've been closed off, and despite my best efforts, she could tell), and I let my complaints out. It turned into a fight, where she (again, like every time I've brought up concerns) claimed I was berating a new mother and she had 2 years  before she could be held to chores. Her bf never bothers her about it (he's dirtier then she is, my missing cup is turned up a month later in his car) and that I was rude and exaggerating. I've tried helping but am met with disrespect. I take care of my niece a lot, her bedtime routine is up to me most nights. Sister swears drinking out of days-old bottles is ok and she's happy/healthy so I need to calm down.\n\nI'm moving out soon, applying to places right now. I'll miss my niece so much and it's already killing me, but I just want to know. AITA for expecting chores to be done and for a certain level of cleanliness to exist, even though my sister is only 4 months postpartum?

I've bought good flea meds for my cats, but she swears that a flea collar and vacuuming (which she doesn't do) will fix the problem. I can't afford the good meds for her cats too, I already have to feed them and take care of the litter box. My cats will be happy when I move out", "I've spent all 4 months trying to get advice from my friends and family, and my family's been telling me that it's fine and I'm not her mother. I feel like I've been gaslit, which makes it harder to argue my concerns when I'm only her aunt\n\nI did take it seriously, which is why I did my best to make sure only clean bottles were available. But this post has helped a lot and validated my concerns, I have more decisions to make on my nieces behalf now", "Meh, not her child.", "One of mine was a ditch kitten, and one was an abandoned foster fail \ud83d\ude05 I've had many fosters throughout my adulthood as well and litterbox cleanliness is something I've had to learn", "Then it's time when you have moved out or before. Depending on how safe you feel, to straight up ask if you should call cps and check if all this is fine. \nAnd if she dont get scared into treating her baby better. It would be tome to actually call them. \n\nI know it's harsh to say, perhaps. And will be even harder to actually do. \nBut she's endangering her child. Both her and the bf. \nDocument silently how things are now. So it won't be easy to brush you off if needed.", "Unless you treat all the cats your cats will still be getting bitten and the house will be infested.  I'd be trying to take all the cats and let them think they got out when you were moving.\n\nYou can use the dog size of many meds and split them up.  You just have to be SUPER careful.  But that's what most rescue folks do.  For instance Advantage II is the same formulation and can be split up using another container and a 1 ml syringe.  But AdvanTIX is poisonous for cats and only for dogs.  I buy the XL dog size of Advantage II and split it up.  But I've done rescue for many years and worked with various groups.  If you have a helpful vet they MAY work with you on this.\n\nFYI Advantage Multi is the same ingredients but different percentages so don't try to split the dog one up for that either.  \n\nThere are some Frontline that you can split.  But seriously, get in touch with rescue groups and learn.\n\nFYI for oral meds of any kind you have to be very careful with cats.  They have really sensitive livers and can't handle a lot of meds dogs and people can.  Tylenol kills cats.  I'd be worried about your environment just because if these idiots drop some pills they won't bother to even try to find them.", "Even if CPS does not take appropriate action, at least there will be documentation of the situation. CPS is a bunch of people, not a monolith of identical decisions and competence or lack thereof. It doesn't matter what your dumb friends and family say or think.", "Foster failures are a fact of life. :) I currently have two of them."]}
