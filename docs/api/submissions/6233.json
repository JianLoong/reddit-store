He was upset that he didn't get a car just like his stepbrother but I already explained the circumstance to him.\n\n\nDays before christmas, I recieved a call from my husband freaking out saying my son took my stepson's car and got in an accident. I almost had a stroke but thankfully my son came out of it with only a broken arm. The car however was totalled. My stepson was going nuts and my husband and his ex started demanding I write them a check of 10 thousand dollars since my son damaged the car they bought. I explained it was an accident but my husband said that it wasn't since my son took it without permission. He advised me to write that check or else he will let his ex file a police report against my son. We had a big argument over this and I was given a \"timeline\" to pay. I refused and insisted it was an accident. My husband said my son might end up being charged but I sternly told him it was unfair and that if he let that happen then his relationship with my son will be damaged. I called him shallow to do this to his stepson over money but he kept presisting.\n\n\nWe've on horrible terms about it since then and I keep refusing to pay because it's not my fault they chose to buy a 12k car and also, like I said it was an accident and my son was hurt.", "created_utc": 1672611489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100v6tf/aita_for_refusing_to_write_my_husband_and_his_ex/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess alternately you could do nothing and let the law run its course but it seems like you don't want your son to have any consequences for this so I'm guessing you are shelling out money either way.

But they're both wealthy (I'm not) and they were in agreement so that's that.\n\n\nMy 19 yo son took it badly. He was upset that he didn't get a car just like his stepbrother but I already explained the circumstance to him.\n\n\nDays before christmas, I recieved a call from my husband freaking out saying my son took my stepson's car and got in an accident. I almost had a stroke but thankfully my son came out of it with only a broken arm. The car however was totalled. My stepson was going nuts and my husband and his ex started demanding I write them a check of 10 thousand dollars since my son damaged the car they bought. I explained it was an accident but my husband said that it wasn't since my son took it without permission. He advised me to write that check or else he will let his ex file a police report against my son. We had a big argument over this and I was givdn a \"timeline\" to psy. I refused and insisted it was an accident. My husband said my son might end up being charged but I sternly told him it was unfair and that if he let that happen then his relationship with my son will be damaged. I called him shallow to do this to his stepson over money but he kept presisting.\n\n\nWe've on horrible terms about it since thrn and I keep refusing yo pay.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They will have to go through insurance and it will come out who the driver was, etc. Their premium will skyrocket. \n\nYou can also try asking your own insurance policy if they will cover your son's damage to another vehicle not on your policy.
