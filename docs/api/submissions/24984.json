My friend (more like a childhood friend) has a small dog who, and I'm saying that as the proud owner of two beautiful pups and an absolute dog lover, is a nightmare. He's not trained and he's not neutered, so he constantly tries to mount my two boys, try being the key because mine are 30 and 40 kg, but he's an annoying little shit. We don't meet up with them anymore because my friend refuses to leash him, and while my dogs don't mind it if they're running around the forest, they hate it when they're leashed when we're on the way there. \n\nMy friend's dog is also an experienced escape artist and is often wandering around town. The other day just as we were leaving for a walk the dog was on my street and followed us around our usual trail. Well, we endured it, and I called my friend and told her we could meet up later so she could come get her dog. Another testament of how awfully trained he is: as soon as my friend showed up and the dog saw her, he immediately ran away again, and my friend told me that he always does that, and not to worry because he was running towards their home already. I was baffled, but anyway, not my problem anymore, I had found the dog, called her and brought him to her, so whatever. \n\nBefore I could leave she mentioned how last year an \"awful\" couple had stolen her poor baby and how traumatic that was, that they kept him for a month but she thankfully found the thieves thanks to a Facebook post. Turns out they had found him, thought him abandoned even though he was wearing a collar, and took him home with them into a city two hours away. I was surprised they caught the dog (I actually tried to leash him so he wouldn't run off again but the little shit almost bit my hand), but I noticed she doesn't have her phone on a plaque or anything on his collar, and I know for a fact that he's not chipped because it \"costs too much money\". So I guess that couple found a collared dog but without any way to contact the owner, and they did what I would do: take him to a vet to read the chip.  When he wasn't chipped, they decided to keep him. But still my friend told the story as if they were villains, when they had returned him straight away when she contacted them.\n\nWell, I told her what I though. If she doesn't make an effort to chip and neuter her dog, or leash him, or train him a bit, or at least keep him from escaping, then she deserved to have her dog stolen, and he probably would have been better off with that nice couple.\n\nShe called me an asshole and left, and my mother also says I was too harsh and it's not my business.
