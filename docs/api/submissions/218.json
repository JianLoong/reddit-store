Your Grandpa's actions almost cost the wedding party their suits for the wedding. As you said the store was busy due to probably homecoming, since it's that time. The job was just to make sure all the parts to the suits were there and in the right size not harass the staff over something that you guys can fix yourself.", "NTA. Grandpa can dish it out but he can't take it when the tables are turned. \n\nHe absolutely deserved to have the store manager and you shut him down.

You shouldn\u2019t let someone get away with treating people like that, especially a teenager who\u2019s working her first year in the customer service/ retail industry. That\u2019s really fu\u00e7king shitty.\n\nGood on you for throwing that back in his face and showing how unappreciated what he did was, regardless of him being your elder. Even parents and grandparents need to be called out when and if they do something wrong.", "NTA gramps should stop being so sensitive", "NTA that girl did not deserve to get yelled at to the point where she cried and ran off. Just because of his age, it doesn\u2019t give him the right to treat people like shit. It\u2019s a level of entitlement to me, like you have the right to completely ruin somebody\u2019s day to the point where they threaten police, but then get upset that there are repercussions for your actions?", "NTA.  Your grandfather has reached that stage some old men reach where it's best to just pretend you can't hear them and ignore them (ironically, they're probably doing that to you a lot too).", "NTA in the slightest bit. Grandpa sure is for treating others like garbage.", "NTA and please call and apologize to the store on your family's behalf. Or send an apology card with a coffee gift card for the girl he made cry. Absolutely right in telling your sister.", "NTA.\n\ngrandpa complained about teens today being too sensitive. yet he complains about how a tie hasn\u2019t been tied properly? hypocritical 100", "NTA.

What problem could he possibly have? They would all get untied and retied as soon as the groomsmen got dressed. Unless they were clip-ons (lol), the way the store prepared the ties couldn't possibly have any impact on the final look.", "NTA. If I found out someone with any connection to my wedding did something like that I'd publicly throw them out. Having been on the other side of that, I have no tolerance for bullying.\n\nI've spent a couple minutes now thinking carefully about that, going through the most beloved people in my life one by one. Unequivocally stand by what I said. No one is immune from the consequences of tarnishing a great day with cruelty to others. \n\nOld mate there needs to do something better with the last 5% of his time sucking air than being an asshole to customer service.", "NTA.

Your sister deserved to know because her and her fiancee's names are attached to those suits - they are owed the opportunity to go back to that business and try to make amends via apology, if only so they're not blacklisted of they need to use them again in future!", "YTA.

Maybe the irony will sink in for the grandpa at some point?", "That's not even a good explanation. My grandpa calls service workers sir and ma'am, regardless of age, says please and thank you, and has never been impolite, even when something went wrong. \n\nAnd I mean egregiously wrong. A while back, some twit decided my grandma's regular hospital carer of a decade was \"too scary\" for children and tiny old women, my family found out about the decision, and my grandpa very politely ripped them a new one about giving my grandma substandard care because the man, while giant and covered in tattoos, was fantastic with all his patients and knew my medically fragile grandma's various conditions inside and out as well as how to best handle her when she had a high CO2 episode at night when there wasn't a relative there. \n\nUnless OP's grandpa has some sort of dementia, he has no excuse to behave so poorly because that certainly was not how his generation was raised to behave.", "Lol", "How? All I said was his age isn\u2019t an excuse, I never said what he did was okay. \nI said OP could have handled the situation better, didn\u2019t say OP was wrong, in fact I said they were NTA. \nIf this was a groomsman acting like the grandfather everyone wouldn\u2019t care about calling him TA because he is. \nAnd again, I was saying his age isn\u2019t an excuse, most people will try and say it is, not all.", "Oh, I was specifically referring to-\n\n>And I don\u2019t believe in giving them a pass because they grew up in a different time.\n\nI just meant there's no possible pass to be given based on time period born anyways because they were taught better than that. \n\nI wasn't disagreeing with you, I was reinforcing what you said by pointing out that regardless of time period born, we were all taught to use basic manners, him included."]}
