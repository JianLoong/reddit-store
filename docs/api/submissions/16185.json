You are dating a real person, not a prop. You deeply want him to do this thing because other people have done it, even though it\u2019s an empty charade. You have already discussed that you want to go to the prom together. Why do you feel so strongly that he should perform a public gesture?", "YTA. If a promposal is so important for you to experience, prompose to him. This crap is getting out of hand.", "A whole ass ESH issue. He called your wants stupid and overrated, you\u2019re coming off as pushy and entitled. Also you can him to prom, doesn\u2019t always have to be the man asking the woman.", "Why don\u2019t you ask him?", "YTA. It's 2023.  Why don't **you** ask **him**?", "YTA. \n\nYou can ask him. Don\u2019t be sexist. And if you want to ignore his wishes give him a promposal. Your obviously more concerned about appearances than actuality and competing with other people in your class.", "You told him what you wanted he told you that he\u2019s not willing to do it for you. Your allowed to be upset but you can\u2019t force him. If it a big deal to you ask him. It\u2019s 2023 be that boss. But he might get upset if you ask.", "INFO: This could go one or two ways. Either Y-T-A over a promposal. Or, this isn't about the promposal. You even said at the very least you want flowers. Maybe the issue is you just don't feel appreciated and based on the way he talks to you I can see why. In that case you would be N-T-A. The issue is we only have this one situation to know. So ig which is it op? Is it just the promposal, or is it something deeper like feeling appreciated?", "ESH. This is obviously important to you and he is being hurtful and disrespectful, and that's unacceptable. At the same time, it sounds like you're really trying to bully him into doing something he doesn't want to do - even to the point of writing it for him? Surely you can see how that would feel like a charade to him. \n\nYou're not wrong for wanting what you want, but he isn't wrong for not wanting it. You guys might just not be compatible like that.\nEdit typo", "NTA.  I've never understood the big promposal thing so I see his point there, but not even flowers?  That's a \"normal\" prom thing.  Guys have been bringing their dates flowers when they pick them up for prom pretty much for as long as prom has been a thing.  \n\nMaybe try explaining to him that you realize it's not important to him but that it's something you've been imagining and looking forward to for years (if that's true) and ask for a compromise.  Maybe no big gesture or fanfare, but that flowers are traditional and it's something that is important to you.  Maybe also ask him if there's anything that's important to him, too.  Also take into consideration his financial circumstances.  Prom is expensive enough as it is, is it possible that money is playing a factor in his reluctance?  \n\nTalk to him.  Don't say it's fine if it isn't, that's dishonest.", "I dunno what label to use for this. Promposals are dumb, yeah, but at the same time times VERY valid to want him to ask you in general. And wanting flowers really isn\u2019t selfish. Lowkey I feel like this is more about you not feeling wanted by him than it is abt the promposal. Maybe he just needs to put more effort in. But at the same time, if the promposal was THAT important, you should\u2019ve just done one yourself. ESH, I guess.", "NAH. You both have different tastes in how prom should work, and in how being asked to go to prom should work. It's really just differences of opinion.\n\nIt's okay that you feel a bit upset. We can't control feelings. But you have to realize that your boyfriend just isn't the type of person that enjoys promposals. Maybe he doesn't want to do that in front of a lot of people. Idk what his personality is, but maybe he prefers things to be more private.\n\nRegardless, you both had the chance to state your opinions, and talked it out. You still disagree. Thing is, for a promposal, he'd have to be the one to make himself vulnerable in front of your peers. You can stand and watch while he spills his heart out or does some elaborate thing. So in the end, it should be his decision. YWBTA if you forced him to prompose to you, but as it stands, no one is an asshole here.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s plenty of reasons he might be uncomfortable doing the big promposal thing. It\u2019s often very public, posted about on IG/other socials. If he doesn\u2019t want to be the centre of attention that\u2019s *his* choice. Someone else said he\u2019s not a prop and I agree. Partners aren\u2019t there simply to please us. He has set a boundary, respect it. He still wants to go with you and spend time with you. He just doesn\u2019t need the fanfare and I can respect it.", "NAH\n\nFor some people, flowers are their love language. I think you just want something to show you're appreciated and valued. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that.\n\nBut he's also not into the premise of a promposal and that's also understandable.\n\nTalk to him about what you really want, the meaning behind it and how you feel. Also listen to his own concerns/finance related things. At the end of the day you should both be able to listen and actually compromise. Otherwise you might not be compatible.", "NTA When I was a senior in hs my bf was a freshman in college and he still agreed to go to my prom because it was special to me. Neither of us were into the whole promposal thingy because it seemed very social media like which we don't use. Now as prom was starting to get closer and I saw all my friends with their promposals I realized I actually really wanted one. I didn't want it for the clout or whatever I just wanted that intimate moment with him. \n\nSo you know what I did? I told him that day that I wanted one, even tho we had dated for over a year at that point and he didn't like them. You know what he did? He said ok and didn't mention anything about it until 2 weeks later when he promposed in private to me.\n\nWhen your in a relationship you sometimes have to make sacrifices and do things you don't like because you want you partner to be happy. Obviously there are exceptions to this tho but not this situation. The amount of time he would have to put in and sacrifice to make you happy is really little and honestly he just seems kinda mean. \n\nIf the roles were reversed and he wanted you to prompose you would right? Even tho that isn't really what you want but you would still do it to make him happy because he's your bf.\n\nI think people are forgetting that promposal shit doesn't always have to be about the public aspect. It's a once I'm a lifetime thing thats really sweet. It can be especially painful seeing all your friends getting to experience it while you can't not because you don't have anyone, but because the one you do have is overally stubborn.\n\nAlso, nowadays \"normal\" prom stuff is a promposal but when past that flowers are a hugeeeeee must and honestly the bare minimum.\n\nYour bf has to realize that it's not only his prom. If he hates having to be nice to his date then he should just go alone.", "ESH. You had these grand plans in your head and didn\u2019t take into account that your BF didn\u2019t want any part of it. And he can\u2019t take a frickin\u2019 hint that he was hit over the head with! I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get the public display of affection you were hoping for. Im sure you\u2019ll have a wonderful time as long as you put this behind you.", "Oh high school drama. Just go with your boyfriend and have a good time. Don't throw a big fit over flowers and other crap you won't even remember a year after you've graduated. Don't focus on what everyone else's boyfriends are doing or you'll end up being one of those adults always trying to keep up with the neighbors.\n\nAnd it's not a marriage proposal. Your boyfriend shouldn't have to ask you to prom, it should simply be implied.", "Going to go against the grain and say NTA. I also think promposals are stupid but it's a small thing that's important to you. I would do it to make my girlfriend happy.", "INFO: I\u2019m not 100% sure what a promposal is. What\u2019s different between that and asking someone to go to prom?\n\nHe should get you flowers.", "Yes. YTA. \n\nThis is the sort of thing that lets him know what you will be like long term.", "Oh she wants it to be able to post it on social media.\n\nYTA.", "I honestly think NAH and that you just aren\u2019t compatible in these types of things. Just know that this will be everything. He\u2019s going to propose to his wife at home with a ring, etc. So if you can\u2019t deal with these types of things, then I would suggest reconsidering your relationship.", "ESH\n\nYeah Canadian here, promposals aren\u2019t a thing here so I don\u2019t get what the big deal is about this. \n\nWhy do you need him to put on a show for prom? He\u2019s already going with you so you at least have a date. \n\nMaybe have a conversation with him and both try to see each others points of view. At the end of the day is this a deal breaker for you? Will you look back in 30 years and still be upset your high school boyfriend didn\u2019t do a big promposal? You won\u2019t, trust me", "NTA. It isn't about the \"promposal.\" It's about the fact that something was important to you and you wanted to feel special, and he was totally dismissive of that.", "ESH\n\nBro won\u2019t even get you flowers for prom.\n\nBut also you sound very entitled wanting an entire promposal. Why didn\u2019t you prompose to him?", "NTA what are you all talking about in the comments. They want their bf to do a sweet thing for them. Thats it. He can just get some flowers thats a totally normal thing to ask for.", "YTA Kid need to run now you have absolute bridezilla energy.", "NTA. You have different expectations of a relationship. He already feels that romance isn't necessary because he's already obtained you as a partner. If you can accept that he's not, as far as we can see, a romantic person then you should adjust your expectations accordingly. Asking someone to do an elaborate promposal when it's not in his nature is too much. But his refusal to compromise by the simple act of getting you flowers means you are always going to be disappointed if you expect him to be demonstrative or romantic or concerned with your feelings in that regard.", "NTA\n\nTell him that \u201cit\u2019s stupid and overrated\u201d but it matters to me.\n\nAnd if he doesn\u2019t budge then he clearly doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you but himself", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying NAH. \n\nForget all these people shaming promposals. If you think it\u2019s a nice gesture and want someone to do it, you\u2019re allowed to have that. But your boyfriend doesn\u2019t have to do it if he doesn\u2019t want to. But I understand you being upset that he isn\u2019t willing to do this for you. It\u2019s just a nice gesture, what is so wrong about that??\n\nSome people have suggested you do the promposal, but I think that\u2019s missing the point. You want to feel important and special. I\u2019m sure a fair number of friends and other students at school are getting them, so you feel left out. And your boyfriend clearly doesn\u2019t like them, so he would probably feel uncomfortable if you did one for him. \n\nY\u2019all can downvote this all you want, but maybe don\u2019t shame the teenager for wanting to indulge in a fun experience that you just happen to think is cringe?\n\nETA: so many people are judging this by saying \u201cyou just want this for instagram\u201d but like, where does OP say that?? She might enjoy the social media attention, but maybe she also wants the memory of her boyfriend making a loving gesture? Promposals don\u2019t even have to be public. Dude won\u2019t even get her flowers!", "NAH You want it one way and he wants it another. Either way you're going to prom so just enjoy it. You're a couple so no need to ask officially unless you're into the fanfare. You seem to be but he doesn't.  Maybe he'll get you a corsage on the night of the event. You'll get a proposal later in life by him or another for a wedding. Remember to enjoy the dance rather than sulking and ruining it for him & yourself.", "YTA", "Yes you don't even need to ask YTA. Stop expecting these grand over the top gestures especially for prom.. \nIf you wanted a big grand gesture then you could have planned it out for yourself months ago. And spend the money on it yourself. \nHe asked you you said yes move on.\n\n\nAnd FYI you get flowers on the day of prom not when your own boyfriend asks you to go.", "If you want something, communicate that. You need to practice now for the future of this relationship and/or others in the future. Don\u2019t expect stuff without asking and don\u2019t assume everyone knows what you\u2019re thinking if you don\u2019t tell them. Most people aren\u2019t mind readers", "YTA", "Your love language is acts of service, his is different.", "Soft YTA\n\nWhen you\u2019re in a romantic relationship with someone, it\u2019s generally expected that you go to social events together. There\u2019s no fanfare, nothing like that because it\u2019s generally not considered necessary. Just wanted to point that out so in the future you\u2019ll have more realistic expectations.\n\nSome people aren\u2019t into large or flashy displays like you described. Just as it was fine for you to ask, it was fine for him to say no & why he didn\u2019t want to do it. The soft YTA is for expecting a promposal without discussing it beforehand. Ideally, you would tell him that you respect his opinion but you were disappointed because you saw your friends getting promposals. Then have an honest discussion about your respective viewpoints on demonstrative acts so you can both better understand your viewpoints going forward.", "NTA for wanting, but after you say \"Hey ask me to prom\" you might get a soft YTA for repeated \"this is how you are supposed to do it\" The fact of the matter is - let your boyfriend be himself.  When you're older you'll find gratitude in a partner being honest vs lying to you.\n\nNow you get to decide if you would rather have a partner who finds romance and flowery stuff annoying but will tell you so, or want to break up with him and find somebody who likes giving flowers or will do it because you prompted him to.\n\nIt's totally OK to want flowers, and to want to feel courted.  Feeling like your boyfriend is excited about an event and wants to romance you is reasonable. It's not so OK to tell somebody what to write and put your words and ideas in their mouths, it's inauthentic and fake, and often leads to resentment on both sides.\n\nI will say that if your boyfriend doesn't see the appeal in it after you clearly told him that you wanted it, then instead of hoping he will change, accept he is who he says he is or accept the relationship isn't for you.  You will save yourselves years of trouble if you learn that and don't try to get somebody to act in a way they don't really want to, to meet YOUR wants.", "NTA\n\neither you ask him or dump him???", "ESH, it sounds like you only want him to \"prompose\" so that you can have your friends video it and take pictures just to post on social media for attention and he doesn't want to do it. You went so far as to suggesting what he can write etc...if you care about a promposal so much why don't you prompose to him? Anyways, I think he would also be an AH for not trying to compromise and give you flowers (if you meant you want him to give you flowers publicly and ask you out to prom then I'd say YTA)\nOverall imo the whole situation is dumb to be arguing about, you're a couple so it's pretty obvious you guys would be going together, what's the big need for a promposal?", "YTA.  Yes you are over reacting.  What is this 'promposal' nonsense?   Don't live your life as if you are permanently on instagram.  Clearly its not his style, so you take him as he is or not.  Your call I guess.", "YTA- You and your BF have been together for 2 years and You have been talking about prom for a while now and  Your  already \"obviously\" going together. This isn't a complete stranger asking you to prom.", "NTA at all and I do not understand the y t a comments. It takes no effort to do a promposal that\u2019s cute or just buy you flowers and ask. It sucks that he doesn\u2019t want to even try and make you feel special when you have to constantly see everyone around you being made to feel special by their S/Os. We might need some info tho, does he just not like being the center of attention? Does he make you feel special regularly? Does he put in the same amount of effort as you? Do you put in effort to make him feel good?", "YTA \n\n\u201cDo the trick in public. Do it. DO IT.

He might feel like it\u2019s showy and impersonal although to you it might mean something.

You guys are teens and this will blow over.", "Nta. Why is everyone acting like it\u2019s such a big ask for OP wanting her boyfriend to get her flowers for an event she sees as important. You can get cheap flowers and markers/a poster board from the grocery store for less than $20. Also nowhere does she say he can\u2019t do this privately like asking her at her house, and has said it\u2019s not for social media reasons. Part of a relationship is doing things you know would make the other person happy, especially if it\u2019s not something hard.", "NAH. You're not an ah for wanting to experience a fun, romantic gesture. And your bf isn't an ah for not being interested in that sort of thing. If you're happy together in other ways, this might be something to let go of. However, it's also possible that this situation is revealing that you express and appreciate feeling loved in different ways that aren't ultimately compatible. There's no harm in having a conversation about what kind of things make each of you feel loved and appreciated, and perhaps you can come to some sort of compromise (or prompromise?). However, you can also think up some fun stuff you can do to make planning for prom special and exciting even without a promposal. Dress shopping with your friends? Manicures? A party to practice different kinds of makeup, or to make jewellery or corsages? A sleepover with your friends after prom, or meeting up for brunch with a group the next morning? Life isn't a romcom or a teen movie, which can be frustrating sometimes but ultimately is probably a good thing. It does mean that you might miss out on some fun moments that are talked up as major teen/high school/college experiences. But it also means that you are free to create joy however you want to, without needing to wait around for someone else to do it for you! \n\nI hope you have a fabulous time at your prom, and that it's even better than on movies or Instagram, because it's real, and it's yours. \ud83c\udf37", "Oh FFS!

You are excited for prom, which is a major milestone for many people, and a major event. It's one that you plan on sharing with your partner.  \nAnd it would be validating, sentimental and special to you if he asked you to prom and expressed his love for you and his acknowledgement and appreciation for how much this event and moment matters to you, and that you want this to be shared with him as someone you love and care about.  \n\nThis, to me, is similar to a partner being upset that their partner refuses to participate in Valentine's Day. They express that it's important to them, and it means a lot, and that it's a day they care about and that they want to have their feelings about this heard and reciprocated.  \n\nWhen you love someone, you don't have to love everything they do. But if something matters to them, if something brings them happiness, joy, is sentimental to them, and is something that they share with you because they want to express \"hey, I care about you, this matters to me and I want you to be part of my inner world because I trust you and want to share my joy with you\", shutting that down because you don't care about that thing is pretty heartbreaking.  \nIf your partner is absolutely wild about football, or loves Christmas, or wants to have a really special wedding, even if it doesn't matter to you, does your partner's joy not bring you joy? A night of watching a game with them, or buying them a thoughtful gift, or asking them to prom seem like such small efforts to make to see them light up with happiness, to see them radiate with love and joy, to be able to say \"hey, I love you, and I will support the things you love, even if I don't find joy in them, because you and your interests matter to me\".  \n\nAnd I bet that's what it feels like- \"It doesn't matter to me. *You* don't matter to me\".  \n\nInstead of doing a simple act expressing love for you, he would rather make you feel like your interests, and something that is important to you, doesn't matter. Because he doesn't see value in it.  \n\nI can't help but ask, does this happen in other areas of your relationship? Does he refuse to participate in activities that you enjoy, if he finds them uninteresting? Will he watch movies you like, even if they're not his type? Music he doesn't prefer? Foods that aren't his favourite?  \nOr does he disengage when you do things you enjoy that he doesn't?  \nAnd similarly, does he expect you to be there while he does what he wants to- movies/music/food/activities he enjoys, is there an unspoken expectation that you enjoy them with him, or not say anything neutral/negative about them?  \n\nAt best, this is an incompatibility between you. At worst, this is your partner not caring about something that is important to you, and that will cause hurt for you. It doesn't matter what it is, if it matters to you, it matters.  \nPlease don't let him ruin prom for you. If he is miserable when you go together, then don't dedicate your wonderful event to trying to make him enjoy it.

Yes she could do it herself, but now she knows he does not care at all about something she likes so it makes no sense to do it to him. \nIts like if she wanted him to do a romantic gesture on valentines day.

Both sides should put in effort, so it\u2019s giving *and* receiving.\n\nAm I saying he should never get her flowers or do grand gestures? No. I\u2019m saying she should do it *for* him. She\u2019s communicating what she wants but he clearly hates it.\n\nPeople are jumping on her because this gesture feels so fake and forced, like it\u2019s just for show. Everyone has different wants and needs, I\u2019d prefer a small \u201cdo you want to go to prom\u201d than something that feels like a forced gesture to me. Everyone has different feelings on the matter, and if he\u2019s invalidating her feelings you\u2019re invalidating his own feelings.\n\nFrankly, I found promposals cute but then it blew up on social media (I am in no way saying she\u2019s doing this for social media, just listing my own reasoning), and it became like an obligation. I despise promposals.\n\nThat said, if my gf would want one, I\u2019d give it to her to make her happy, it barely effects me. Some people have stronger feelings about it though, and he clearly doesn\u2019t want to do this.\n\nIt\u2019s a major event in her life, but it\u2019s also a \u201cminor thing\u201d, please pick one. It\u2019s either a major event or a minor thing lmfao", "Prom - A high school dance\n\nEngagement - A commitment to get married, and to spend the rest of your lives together.\n\nThere\u2019s a significant difference between the two of them", "It's absolutely disrespectful to think op is in the wrong for wanting her bf, her partner, to show some effort and care for her. There's nothing wrong with that at all. He clearly doesn't care so why should she put in effort for him when he'll just brush it off and call it stupid? Also, your argument doesn't fit here at all. She wants the flowers and him to ask. So if she wanted him to do that for her why would she do it for him? Unless they both did it for each other. Which, again, he obviously doesn't care and thinks it's stupid.", "No idea why you were getting down voted so much for everything you said. Like the poor girl isn\u2019t wrong for wanting a sweet gesture from her boyfriend when getting asked to prom. Especially when you see them on TikTok or other socials. Just the other day I saw one where a guy got his friends to act like his noble steed and his footmen/announcers and he was a king asking his lady to a grand event. Super cute. I can\u2019t fault young girls seeing things like that and wanting it too. A partner should want to do nice things for their SO and make them feel loved. I agree there should be a compromise or should split because she deserves someone to make her feel special somehow.", "Exactly. I find these grand gestures so over the top and fake. I\u2019d much rather just ask my girlfriend to prom in an intimate moment between the two of us, give her flowers and kiss her. That\u2019s so much cuter to me than a full blown promposal.\n\nThis is just a difference of what people like, and so many are saying he should do something he\u2019s not comfortable doing.", "Shocker but not everyone likes oral. Personally I'm not a fan of recieving. He thinks it's stupid. So why would she give him something he doesn't like? \n\nI do like giving oral. I love making my partner happy. It fills me with warm fuzzy feelings when I can do things I know he enjoys, and not just sexually. \n\nMinor things can. Be major events. I'm approaching 50. Some of my most important and fondest memories are the little things someone did for me. \n\nAs an example. When I had my son (very major event) I was in the hospital the day after. It was early morning and no one was visiting and I was feeling a bit alone. A good friends dad who was working in the hospital that day stopped by to give me and my new son good wishes from their family. It meant so much to me. I still remember how that made me feel and it's been over 20 years. Such a small gesture (minor thing heck he was already there for work) on his part but I felt so supported and loved.", "Don't blame your age... View this situation more in terms of feeling loved and being shown that you're special to your partner.\n\nFor e.g., I know my friends love me, but it still makes me feel special and reaffirms their love and care towards me when they surprise me with a happy birthday slice of cake at my birthday dinner at a restaurant. \n\nIt's good to be shown love and care by those around you. And it's ok to want that from others - especially at social events which sort of make or break your identity/life at that particular moment in time. If you want to argue that these things shouldn't have so much power in a person's identity, and their identity in their microsociety - I agree. But at the end of the day, it *does* matter and we can't change that societal expectation at the moment. \n\nAlso, if he's saying no to these things, how can we be so sure that he will be flowers when he actually comes to pick her up for the date?", "I think in part it's odd to dread giving your partner a card or a few flowers and asking them on a date to prom. It's such a small gesture that means a lot to the op. \n\nNo he should have to do things he doesn't want to. But I married someone like this. Never got birthday cards, presents. Anything from him at Christmas let alone random nice gestures. \n\nI will never date anyone who doesn't delight in making me smile. I delight in making partner happy, especially when it's usually the little things that mean the most in the long run.", "Except if both are meaningful to your partner, you put in effort. \n\nA birthday happens every year, but if OP\u2019s boyfriend stopped giving her a gift for her birthday, or never ever did anything special to celebrate with her he\u2019d be an asshole. \n\nAlso, a high school dance literally happens once or twice for most people. You can get engaged as many times as you want.", "> She wants the flowers and him to ask\n\nThis right there is my *entire* point. She wants a grand gesture, but can\u2019t instead do it for her boyfriend? She wants it, but if she isn\u2019t willing to do it for him then why does she deserve it? Relationships are a two way street.\n\nI despise promposals so much. I found them cute before, but it\u2019s so bloated on social media it just feels like it\u2019s for show now (Note: I am not saying she\u2019s doing this for social media, just listing why I hate it). I also generally just don\u2019t like grand gestures and prefer simplicity.\n\nIf my gf wanted this I would oblige to make her happy, but it would feel so forced and fake for me. He clearly has strong issues on the matter, and y\u2019all are dog piling on him for not doing something he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing.", "Yep. That's the main thing here a partner should WANT to do these things even if it makes them uncomfortable. And if it does and they voice these concerns, then the other person should recalibrate what they want so that both needs are being met as best as possible. If not, it's ok to say bye.\n\nI think persons just aren't able to view a multifaceted situation for what it is, nor read/ask for all the information before making a judgement.", "Did you miss the part where OP asked for just flowers and something sweet said to ask her? It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s asking for anything public or a big gesture at all.", "I know not everyone likes receiving oral, but on the flip side some people don\u2019t like giving oral.\n\nThat\u2019s my entire point here. He doesn\u2019t like this, but according to everyone he should because it would make her happy. \n\nI agree with your small gestures point, though I\u2019m much younger than you (18). I love giving and receiving small gestures, and for prom I personally would ask her to go with me, give her flowers and a kiss. A small intimate moment feels so much cuter to me than a bigger gesture.\n\nAt the end of the day this feels like a difference of opinion and emotion, and there\u2019s NAH.\n\nI also don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to agree on a point, so agree to disagrew", "But what if *you* don\u2019t find it meaningful like the BF? I hate promposals so much, for reasons I\u2019ve listed multiple times in this thread. I would do it if my gf asked, but I\u2019d hate every second of it and it would feel so forced to me, because it would feel like I\u2019m faking it.\n\nGiving gifts and celebrating is different than proper grand gestures? \n\nEngagements happen many times sure, but engagements usually mean a commitment for the rest of your lives, and that is a much bigger deal than a high school dance", "Grand gesture? That's the bare minimum.\n\n>despise promposals so much\n\nSo you're biased. op also specified that it's not a sm clout thing and, if I recall correctly, that it doesn't need to be public. It's what she wants to make her happy. That's perfectly fine. She's communicating her wants like anyone in a healthy relationship does. She didn't push it either. She asked, made some suggestions then dropped it.\nWe're not dog piling on him, we're letting op know that she's not in the wrong for wanting her bf to show affection. There's a difference.\n\nWe're clearly not going to agree so I'll end it here with you. Have a day."]}
