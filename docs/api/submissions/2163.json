It's admirable for you to take time out of your schedule to give him a well deserved break but that doesn't give SIL the right to add more work to your plate. If she wants her daughter to spend time with her mother then I'd tell her to take the week off & spend it taking care of your mother.

I hope your BIL eventually has a nice week to himself. Is there any form of official respite care he can access?

Hopefully you & BIL will be able to work out another time to give him a break; I'm sure he appreciates the offer & is uber pissed at his sister for fudging this up for him.\n\nIf you're in the USA & MIL is on Medicaid, check out this website to see if BIL can apply for a caretaker stipend for the inhome* care he provides (if he hasn't already done so). \nhttps://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/getting-paid-as-caregiver/", "Sounds like sister just wants a break herself and figured you could watch both at once. \n\nNTA.

Bathe herself, dress herself, feed herself. At least that\u2019s how it is if they are in a nursing home. I would think to keep in home care might be a little less able.", "There are other options for getting BIL more permanent help as well. Call Adult Services at the social service office and see if they have any suggestions. And he could call her doctor or her insurance company directly and ask about his options.", "NTA.  I hate hate hate when I agree to do something, the something suddenly become bigger.  \n\nI used to volunteer for an organization where every volunteer job I agreed to do became something entirely different, requiring more personal resources and time.  Agree to address and mail a newsletter with another volunteer at the office would become buy the envelopes and stamps and take the original to the printer and fold and stuff envelopes at home...  \n\nPeople who do that suck.  Your SIL sucks.  What a user.  Stay clear of that one.", "NTA. If you are in the US, there are most likely programs that can help your brother-in-law provide care to your MIL. If your MIL has Medicaid, she will qualify for many \u201chome and community based services\u201d depending on her abilities and needs. However, many counties also offer programs for people who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid due to them having too much income or assets. You won\u2019t know until you check it out. The eligibility waits may be long and the process to enroll full of hoops to jump through, but it\u2019s worth it and you can check it out from anywhere. \n\nEach state\u2019s program is a little different, but every state has something to help keep people out of nursing homes. \n\nCheck with her county\u2019s or State\u2019s Division of Aging office. \n\nAgain, NTA. However, I wonder with clear guidance if niece may be an asset. I bet she probably would want to get away from her mom.", "If you are in the usa you can talk to social workers and hospice they can help find resources for you.

My caregiver is to help me with getting groceries, and helping me get my laundry and garbage up to street level where the laundry room and dumpsters are located. I don't need more help than that so I don't get more hours. If your MIL is in a county where they have that, check with them. The info may be found on the county's webpage. Just my $.02.", "NTA. Good for you", "You have every right to be annoyed with SIL. Sounds like she wanted time off of dealing with her grumpy teen daughter. I don't think you're an asshole for postponing your trip but a better solution would have been to have BIL call SIL to come get her daughter. \n\nSorry your trip got ruined. Totally okay not to go to take care of a teenager you weren't expecting.", "So wait, Brian didn't even know the niece was there? Does that mean SIL left a minor alone with MIL? If that is true, the first step after informing Brian should have been to call SIL and tell she better be picking the niece up or CPS was going to be called. Sure, 16 is old enough to leave at home or a safe location, at the home of an elderly person with neurological problems is not one of those two. You don't just leave a minor basically alone like that! MIL is in no position to do anything and could have even been hurt or worse.\n\nThough even if the niece wasn't left alone without proper supervision, NTA and SIL should be forced to go and take the niece back.", "NTA \n\nSIL needs to pick her kid p asap!", "NTA", "NTA. Someone heard \"Free babysitter!\" for a week. \n\nGood for you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA you volunteered to take care of MIL not your niece and your niece doesn\u2019t sound to great to be around either. Your SIL took advantage of MIL knowing she makes poor decisions (I\u2019m guessing SIL was tired of her own child too which is why she wanted her gone for a week as well).", "NTA, your sister in law is an awfull person! What a mooch! I'm sorry for everyone involved. It is clear your MIL couldn't comprehend the situation because of her brain damage. Your SIL deliberately exploited her!", "NTA \n\nAlso info pls: what\u2019s your spouse\u2019s role in all of this? What are their reasons for not staying with & looking after their mother?", "NTA. That's a pretty big assumption SIL made, that since you would be taking care of MIL, you'd be fine taking care of the niece. Not to mention that she didn't get this approved by BIL, first! She's being extremely entitled and I don't blame you one bit for refusing to be a part of it!\n\nKeep us updated. I'm curious how this turns out.", "NTA also why isn't your spouse pitching in to help with THEIR mother? Why is it on you?", "NTA. You're doing a wonderful thing by helping out your BIL, especially when his own sister refuses to.\n\nDumping your child alone in a house with someone who is not capable of looking after her is cruel to everyone involved! Maybe the niece spends so much time on her phone because the other option is interacting with her mum?\n\nIt's tough caring for someone who's in decline, especially when they insist on trying to carry on as normal. Is MIL's cognitive impairment bad enough to have someone else make medical decisions for her? My Nan had dementia and was *very* stubborn. The first few weeks of living in a nursing home were hard for her, she was angry, scared, and didn't fully understand what was going on. A couple of months on and she was happy as could be! She started to help the staff there clean the kitchen, they did gardening, went on day trips, she was making friends!\n\nI've seen a couple of people calling MIL an AH for being 'happy with the situation', and for letting niece be dropped off. To those people: Cognitive Impairment means her mind is suffering. Op states that she has trouble making sensible decisions. Stop trying to paint a severely ill elderly woman as the villain here.\n\nOp, reschedule without telling SIL, let your poor BIL get his week away. I think MIL's children need to have some difficult conversations about MIL's continuing care. Consider reaching out to your niece, too. Maybe offer to take her for a weekend? Work out if she's okay at home. I wish you all the best.", "Jesus Christ that sounds so ominous lol", "This is called child abandonment. I\u2019d have called cps.", "Next time, on Dateline...", "Perfect, indeed! Do THIS, OP!", "Yay, week long sleepover for SIL and niece!", "She is for expecting OP to watch her teenager but not for refusing to take on any of her mother's care. Not everyone can handle the emotion involved in caring for a decling parent, even for brief periods. SIL may just be lazy and selfish but it's also possible she's not ready to face the reality of her mother's condition or cope with the role reversal in caring for her mother when their relationship was already troubled. Elder abuse is sadly not uncommon and IMHO when someone refuses to be a carer for an elderly family member they shouldn't be judged for it.", "NTA \n\nAlso, anyone with a 16 YO who hasn't taught the child even rudimentary life skills ought to be charged with neglect. Not your problem, but it just posses me off when alleged parents don't think their kids need to know basic life skills.", "NTA.  But you two need to get  MIL accessed  so she can  get the right care and help and Brian can get  his life back.", "NTA and your SIL is a stone cold asshole. I feel for your BIL. Do you know what he's going to do if they can't afford groceries for her? Not your issue to solve, I just hope he sends the niece home immediately before you all have bigger problems.", "NTA. Your SIL is though.", "Yeah, the time for SiL to call was way before she dropped off her daughter and then she should have asked, not told. NTA. SiL is simply upset someone called her out on her bad behavior in trying to make her daughter staying there a fait accompli. \n\nWhere is the niece in all this? Did she even want to go? Did she understand it was a respite care situation? What was she bringing to the visit in terms of helping out?", "I almost want to have you drive down, pick up MIL and niece drive them to SIL and drop them off so they can spend time together.\n\nBut on a more serious note,  since your BIL works part time, and MIL probably has no income they may be eligible for different care programs for elder care or temp nurses to come and help provide support to BIL and give him small breaks during the week.", "Definitely. All I read was \"sil dumped 16yo she didn't want to deal with off on elderly woman and unwitting aunt/uncle\". It was never about helping and shouldn't the 16yo be in school anyway?", "NTA. OP volunteered to give BIL time off. Very kind of you OP :)  Not babysit a 16 year old.", "NTA. No wonder Brian can\u2019t get a break! At the first sign of some done time, you have vultures dropping off more responsibilities. \n\nOP, it doesn\u2019t really matter what your relationship with your niece is (although not having one makes this all worse), your plate would already be full. You don\u2019t (neither does Brian) need additional duties especially when you weren\u2019t consulted. SIL can keep her teenager. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA \n\nBrian should just take his niece home.\n\nSpeaking from experience, care giver burn out is a real problem, and Brian is the one who needs additional support. Just because mom dropped her off doesn't mean she has to stay", "NTA.  Your husband and his children need to sit down and have a discussion about your MIL's future.  It isn't fair for Brian to be doing all of that for MIL.  I understand that she needs help, but instead of requiring a family member to give up their lives for care, they need to think about getting MIL either home health care (can be arranged through a local welfare agency) or MIL needs to be in a residential facility.  Once all of the family are onboard, your husband's family needs to have a frank discussion with MIl, explaining that the current situation can't continue and give her the two alternatives.  Let her choose.  Hope your husband's family make the tough decisions for everyone's sanity.", "YTA.  What SIL did was wrong, but you handled this poorly.  BIL was probably really looking forward to the break and you let him down.  You could've sucked it up with niece for the sake of peace or told SIL to take niece back and been in the right.  By backing out of your promise YTA.", "INFO: Was Brian going to take the week off from work, and if so, can he now push that out to when you visit? Or will this be an issue for him to realign so that he is off from both work and domestic care?", "NTA. You are incredibly generous and empathetic to offer this to your BIL, as well as your well prepared planning to ensure your MIL will be comfortable.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this has been asked and answered, but did SIL end up coming back to pick up her daughter?"]}
