It's admirable for you to take time out of your schedule to give him a well deserved break but that doesn't give SIL the right to add more work to your plate. If she wants her daughter to spend time with her mother then I'd tell her to take the week off & spend it taking care of your mother. This is a working vacation for you, not a social visit that warrants unnecessary visitors who won't contribute/assist with help.", "NTA  You didn't volunteer to babysit niece, only MIL.", "I like how fast you think, absolutely NTA for handling that so cleanly.  Just don't go.  \n\nGive it a little time though, your BIL may be able to make the niece disappear within the next few days.", "NTA. SIL sucks. MIL also for being \u2018happy with her current situation\u2019 when that situation is that her son is burnt out and frustrated. \n\nI\u2019m glad your BIL is upset with the right person. And I hope you get to do the week helping out soon.\n\nBut that\u2019s a temporary reprieve. Your husband, BIL and SIL need to talk seriously about this entire situation. If MIL needs to go into care, it\u2019s time to start the ball rolling, and they ALL need to be part of it.", "Absolutely NTA. I am in a situation similar to your BIL, - looking after my dad with the same issues. Your offer help him and your MIL was lovely and I wish my siblings would take that initiative. I don\u2019t have many nieces and nephews, but if they were dumped here for free babysitting while another sibling was taking the load off me for a week, I would rip their parents a new one. I hope your BIL eventually has a nice week to himself. Is there any form of official respite care he can access? Because as someone who hasn\u2019t had time off for 6 years except a brief but disastrous 4 day holiday and a few times where dad has been in hospital (which is stressful to the max), more time off, even for a day, would be beneficial.", "Info why isn\u2019t sil taking care of her mom for a week \n\nEther way you\u2019re nta", "NTA.  I think you handled the situation perfectly.", "Talk to your BIL to check into getting home health. Let her doctor know at least.", "What an incredible gall she has! NTA at all. I'd react the same, a hearty NO is the appropriate response. \n\nI would check in daily to ensure the elder is cared for well at the hands of a niece who was just dumped off by her mother.", "NTA - SIL tried to get away with a thing. I hope you are asking your spouse to find out why SIL thought that would be ok.", "NTA. Sounds like it\u2019s time for your partner and his siblings to make some tough love choices. MIL can get some home care, or get into assisted living. It sounds like she and Brian need it. It is an unfair arrangement to BOTH of them. MIL is not being cared for properly and Brian cannot care for her properly and is making huge personal sacrifices in an attempt to do so.", "Tricky because your solution now in turn screws over your BIL but NTA.  Another solution might have been better, like telling SIL \"No\" and, if that doesn't work, threatening to call child protective services.", "NTA", "NTA, she fundamentally altered the agreement. You agreed to watch mother-in-law, not the 16-year-old", "NTA. The only AH in the situation is the one who dumped her. If you'll let me read too much into this, retreating into the phone that much can be a sign that the kid is being overwhelmed or even abused. The phone becomes the only source of safety and comfort.
