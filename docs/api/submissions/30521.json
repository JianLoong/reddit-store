My husband\u2019s sister, my SIL, Kelly (40sF) also has two twin boys (12M). All three of our boys are in the same grade at the same school.\n\nMy son is very kind and overall an extroverted kid who\u2019s involved in lots of extracurriculars so he has been making lots of new friends and is getting invited to a lot of the other boys\u2019 events and whatnot. To put it bluntly, Kelly\u2019s sons are obnoxious and entitled. This is because of her behavior. She\u2019s absolutely obsessed with them and has no life outside of being a helicopter parent. For example, one of my nephews had a crush on a girl at school and when the girl\u2019s mom jokingly brought it up to Kelly, she freaked out saying the girl is \u201ckinda weird\u201d so her son \u201cobviously wouldn\u2019t have a crush on a girl like that\u201d. Who bullies a 12 year old girl or her mother?!? She has raised her boys to think they\u2019re above all the other kids and they definitely act that way, even towards my own son, their cousin.\n\nNaturally, her boys are not getting invited to much and a lot of the mom groups of the boys in their grade aren\u2019t including her. So she has just been inviting herself to events she hears of with the boys. Last week, there was a bday party for a girl in our kiddos class that Kelly\u2019s sons weren\u2019t invited to, but she just dropped them off at bday party and left without even checking in with the bday girl\u2019s family. The girl\u2019s mom called me asking me to speak to Kelly bc a lot of the moms are absolutely sick of her inviting herself and her boys to things.\n\nSo when I talked to her, she immediately flipped the script calling me an \u201cenabler\u201d of the other mom\u2019s exclusion and bullying towards her and her boys. Basically accusing me of having an agenda to make her boys seem like \u201closers\u201d for not being invited so that my son has more friends. I just told her that if her kids are \u201closers\u201d, it\u2019s because she raised them to be entitled and mean and it reflects directly from how she treats the other mothers. Now my MIL is calling me saying I should be vouching for my nephews to join my son\u2019s friend group because \u201cfamily\u201d and all that bs.

I don't know where these people live, but where I grew up (and it wasn't like a super poor area or anything) CPS didn't do shit unless kids were literally starving or were black and blue.  I had so many friends get sent home with their abusive parents.", "Seriously. Just tell the moms to call Kelly and have her come pick her kids back up. If it keeps up, start just driving the boys back home yourself. If it escalates, keep the parties on the down low and just make sure Kelly doesn\u2019t find out. Block her socials, etc. This is an insane reason to call CPS and/or the cops.", "Because THAT would work /s", "Seriously. This is such aggressive advice :/", "Yep. I can hear SIL now: \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just jealous of you boys because you have such a wonderful mother who devotes herself totally to her wonderful amazing handsome boys! If they ignore you it\u2019s because they wish they had your looks & brains. So tell them they\u2019re losers & help yourself to a birthday gift or two on your way out\u201d.", "Sure they will.  You can\u2019t get the cops to show up to a bar fight, but they\u2019ll break their necks to get to a kid\u2019s birthday party to deal with uninvited guests.  No doubt they\u2019ll make that their highest priority.  \n\nSuch a great use of tax payer\u2019s resources too.", "You\u2019re joking, right?  Show me a kid who\u2019s never blown off a party they were dropped off at and lied to their parents.  No, that\u2019s not a valid use of CPS\u2019s incredibly limited resources.  Kids have done that since the opportunity existed with practically zero negative impact. \n\n\n\nHelicopter parenting like this is a big part of why today\u2019s children suffer from such low self esteem and struggle to become independent and should be considered abuse.", "I know!  You can tell these people have never actually had to call the cops or seen how lax CPS can be.", "So all the other kids should hide their birthday parties and events because of this one walking headache that happened to reproduce?\n\nUm\u2026no.\n\nWhy should op have to try and manage all the crap for this woman? How is it her responsibility? Why is everyone else expected to alter their behavior because of one crappy parent?\n\nNo. She\u2019s the one making the mess, she\u2019s the one who needs to deal with it. If she\u2019s leaving her kids on other people\u2019s doorsteps without talking to them or clearing it she is abandoning her children.\n\nYou call the cops for child abandonment.\n\nShe\u2019s putting these kids in danger- those kids know they\u2019re not wanted at the parties, they may go just to feel like they\u2019re included or get the free food and gift bags or whatever but that\u2019s gotta be a toll on them.\n\nHow long before they leave the party they\u2019re not wanted at not expected at and not even welcome at and end up getting into real trouble or getting hurt?\n\nHow long before their mom abandoning them at a place they\u2019re neither wanted nor welcome starts to do damage to their self worth?\n\nYou abandon you child somewhere you deserve the cops called on you. Got the feeling one call from the cops about her behavior and it\u2019d embarrass her enough she wouldn\u2019t do it again. \n\nIf the kids want to be invited to things maybe they can take a page from their cousin and learn how to actually be tolerable and then they\u2019d be included.\n\nOp is NTA- this woman is not your responsibility.", "Child abandonment is a *serious* issue! And cops generally do take that seriously. It\u2019s parents doing this stupid shit that gets kids taken and sold into sex slavery. Sex trafficking is real for both males and females!", "It\u2019s happened before that cops will show up for child abandonment.", "They will show up. It\u2019s a serious issue.   \n\n\nWild speculation, but this mom sounds like the type that would let her sons in a neighbor\u2019s yard to use the pool. Because they waaaaant to swim.", "I\u2019m trying to imagine calling the cops in my town for this.", "Just as likely as this post", "They weren't invited, she's not checking in with the parents, and she's literally abandoning her children without permission. It's trespass and child abandonment. Kids have been removed for less, ffs.", "But if the parents know the kid is supposed to be there, they can follow up with the other parents, like, \"hey,I thought Jimmy was going to be at this party. Oh, you dropped him off here? Yeah, he never came in.\" But if the host parents have no idea Jimmy got dropped off (because he hasn't been invited) no one would know Jimmy wandered off.", "Not sure where you live but here a lot of birthday parties are at activity centers & trampoline parks, which around here are all standalones on the highway. If a kid fucked off from there, he\u2019s likely to become roadkill, not to mention the worse things that can happen to an unattended child on the shoulder of a highway.\n\n\nI grew up in the city where we could wander off to a playground, fast food joint, arcade or whatever so I\u2019ve done it. But in suburban & rural areas it\u2019s not an option. Not dumping my kids on the side of the highway isn\u2019t helicopter parenting, it\u2019s the absolute least I should do as their mom.", "Kids are not being sex trafficked because they crash a birthday party or a playdate they weren't invited to. Sex trafficking happens to kids who runaway from home, flee abuse or are groomed by untrustworthy romantic partners. We've got to stop with the myth that suburbs are just crawling with sex traffickers and focus the attention and resources on the people who truly are vulnerable and exploited.", "This is the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever read", "Of course the cops will show up for child abandonment.  That\u2019s not child abandonment, it\u2019s a rude violation of social norms.", "That\u2019s not child abandonment, it\u2019s a rude violation of social norms.  Given police response times, odds are the mom returns before the cops show up, if they actually do show up.\n\nHave you ever actually called the cops?  It takes them FOREVER, especially in cases like this because they consider it a nuisance call and they know if they take their time the \u201cproblem\u201d will fix itself before they show up.", "The area I live in would most definitely be considered rural.  Somehow kids survive looking out for themselves.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t check in, that\u2019s just good manners, but most people wouldn\u2019t think twice about dropping their kids that age off at the park or at a party.", "My 18 year old niece was taken from her small town, drugged up and was on the way to Mexico Asshole! These kids are dropped off and nobody watching out for them has a much higher chance of being taken and sold into the sex trafficking. Just because you\u2019re too fucking stupid to see it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening!", "Nah, disagree with you.", "Dropping your kids off at a place they do not have permission to be and then driving away is literally abandoning the child. That doesn't change just because it's a place other kids live.", "They are children. But the adults at the house did not agree to watch their children and did not invite the children to the party. The cops would respond to the call and it is considered child abandonment as the mother just left.", "That\u2019s your right."]}
