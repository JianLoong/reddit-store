Now you\u2019re not.", "You didn't burn the bridge- they did.

But is that a bridge to anywhere you want to go? Sounds like it\u2019s not, so burning it sounds like a good idea. The only way to change the trajectory of bigotry and hate in this country is the be outspoken about distancing ourselves from the bigoted people.

Small-minded people who think it's cool to trash LGBTQ and impose their morals on others suck.

I would cut off the person who told you to mend fences too, because that just shows they agree with the bigotry. It's really easy for a politician to just *not* mention a hot-button topic and focus on the ways they're the right person for the job instead, but this one chose hate as a \"benefit\" of having them in office.", "Lol ok sure. They\u2019ve provided no proof our district schools have done that.
