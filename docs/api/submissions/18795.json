Since he got his new girlfriend he wanted there to be the boundary between girlfriend and friends, which the whole group agreed too because there were so many issues when he split with his ex because we all were besties with her.\n\nOver time he's basically threw the boundary out the window with his current and wanted us all to be close and besties, I have never been keen, but I've been their as support sometimes if his current girl is having issues that he can't really be bothered to deal with (like petty girl drama at work etc, he thinks cos I'm a girl, I like dealing with that stuff... So wrong lol I hate it but he's my boy, I'll help where I can). \n\nRecently I've bought it to his attention that she's not my best friend and I don't feel comfortable becoming besties with her just cos I'm a girl myself. I'm gay, I'm a lads lad. I stressed that i still think shes lovely and it would still be nice to see her on these occasions when we have our socials out and have a catch up, but just like you would with anyones partner. My dad loves my mums friends and really gets along with them at socials, but he ain't besties with them outside of that. He was offended and she was offended. \n\nThe reason why I bought it to his attention is because previously I had him and her corner me for something that wasn't even warranted.\n\nwe arranged to have a social but the month prior to it we were all busy so hadn't spoke, until we went for our social, and they admitted to crucifying me behind my back for not reaching out and that I should've and I was wrong that I didn't basically... But not once did they reach out to me lol so I was just doing life knowing I'll be seeing them at our social anyway so I was none the wiser, didn't even know there was an issue until they cornered me, and that made it clear, she was getting way too close to me because that shouldn't of even affected her enough to let wind her up and say those things with him. \n\nIt also made it clear that my boy had changed, cos hes never been like that, were all pushing 30 (except his girl who isn't mid 20's yet I don't think) and have busy work lives and lives in general, but that's a separate issue. \n\nAnyway, she's majorly offended and so is he, am I the a hole?", "created_utc": 1685706367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yadnk/aita_for_telling_my_best_friends_girlfriend_i/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think I even had this situation when I was a teenager. This is the first time I've had this sort of thing even be an issue, so I was just totally thrown!", "Thanks god!

This is only one part of the crap I had to deal with.

He is playing into those insecurities rather than advising she try and just create relationships organically. I think you've done everything perfectly and it will likely take some time for him to actually understand what you are experiencing now. People in my friend group who have gotten partners often bring them to meetup, but rarely to they become part of the 'core' gang, not for any reason just its an exclusive club with high standards for entry. (joke we are just insufferable to the rest of the world ;) )", "Ya it's difficult situation. I think they just assumed girls get on well with girls and boys get on well with boys but this isn't the case. His gf probably saw you as a potential best friend from the group as ye have something in common. It's understandable why she is a bit hurt but at the same time it's not your responsibility. Responsibility aside, you may be tempted to be the nice person but down the line it would make things difficult so I myself always try not to get too personal with friends partners as it forces you to take a side instead of staying out of any issue.", "He is pushing **himself** on you, dear. They come as a pair now so yes she will support him and you do need to accept that, but the basis of the protest was from him, right?\n\nWhat you said was indeed out of order. Maybe or maybe not not for content, but definitely for the audience. Your issue is with him, not her, and and attacking her was an insult to them both\u2026..but directed at her, not him. That wasn\u2019t right. Aim, then shoot, not the other way around.", "Good shout! I didn't even think of that, no doubt they'll tell me AGAIN how hurt they are, so I'll say that actually. Thanks man!", "It is! Proper sticky one! I understand her hurt too, cos no one every wants to hear something like that. I think that's where I probably acknowledge I went wrong, being nice a couple time cos he wouldn't deal with her on certain things and pointed her my way, has probably given her and even him the impression we could be besties. That's why I was so keen to nip it in bud now before it gets worse!", "I told him first and when she messaged after he told her, I just repeated the same thing to her. I accept she supports him 100% which is why I didn't attack in a horrible way, tried to do it as nicely as possible. I told him that I didn't appreciate him getting her to message me on his behalf etc as it isn't her place to do that. If he wants to tell me, ask, or say something to me himself he has to do that, not get her to do it.", "No they're 2 separate people, they don't become one, when you do relationships like that youll constantly encouter problems. OP said she had it out with her boy first then the girlfriend messaged saying how she was also hurt by what OP said to the actual best friend so they just told them the same thing. \n\nBoyfriend and girlfriend came at OP for a pathetic reason then got annoyed when OP set a boundary to avoid it from happening again. \n\nOP's boy mate is just being lazy in my opinion and his girlfriend seems to be his voice because he heard something he didn't like? I could be wrong with that last statement but that's how it comes accross.", "You don't need reddit for that kinda comebacks.

Not one person see's it how you do so I would like to know how you came to that conclusion cos I am truly baffled by this odd take on this situation.", "Why are you talking to the op so condescendingly in all your replies ?", "That's fair, I'll accept that view on it", "That isn't what it says. Read the whole post, the boundary was originally set up and so on and so on\n\nIt literally says that they had an up and coming meet up and everyone was busy so no one spoke until that meet up, not even the BF and GF reached out either or gave any idea they were pissed and then they admitted to \"crucifying\" OP behind their back? Where did you get your script from? Are you the OP's friends by any chance?\n\nEDIT: I'm gonna actually be serious about my last question now.. I was originally kidding but I'm actually suspicious... OP didn't really state what was said, more the nature of the conversation, so how do you know what was said was \"Nasty\" cos I see nothing nasty in this --\n\n \"Recently I've bought it to his attention that she's not my best friend and I don't feel comfortable becoming\nbesties with her just cos I'm a girl myself.

And he did act an AH.\n\nBut I\u2019d not turn it into some twisted attack on this girl. This girl is just supporting her boyfriend and his being (incorrectly) upset. She\u2019s not the focus of the conflict, they boy and the OP are, and the OP should be addressing the issue with her \u201cbestie\u201d and not his current date.", "Well geez I didn\u2019t think I was! And wasn\u2019t intending to.", "What on earth are you going on about?\n\nThe boy set the boundary. Not the OP. *And the boundary has shit all to do with this post.*\n\nAnyhow\u2026. They have a \u201csocial\u201d. They get together face to face.\n\nHer friend, the boy, was upset. He thought the OP\u2019s communication was crap. (I don\u2019t agree with him, by the way. He could have called himself.) The boy\u2019s girlfriend was upset with and for him. The boy speak his mind, and his gf is there and supports his (incorrect) stance.\n\nThe response? \u201cI\u2019m not her fricking best friend, she\u2019s nothing to me.\u201d\n\nWhat?\n\nCall **the boy** out. Call him a one way AH. Totally. 100% on board. But the BS spin of not addressing him **and instead going after his GF is wrong.** Period. And that\u2019s the end of that."]}
