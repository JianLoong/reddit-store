{"id": 27771, "submission_id": "16tvh1y", "title": "AITA for telling my extended family about how my family treats me?", "selftext": "So I 25 m am the oldest of 3 siblings my sister 20 f and brother 18 m is my parents favorite. \n\nMy parents pretty much let me fend for my self. They told me that I won\u2019t make it far in life and that I should just become my siblings care taker. They also told my siblings how much they loved them and that they should just ignore me as they would kick me out at 18.\n\nMy siblings were awful towards me until they got to their teens and after that they treated me with respect and love, we are all close now. They have stood up for  me against my parents multiple times and have had my back. \n\nI recently graduated from law school (not in the US) and have started working for a law firm. I think I have done good for my self as I have a lovely partner and have a wonderful extended family. \n\nYesterday I hosted a family get together and didn\u2019t invite my parents (haven\u2019t talked to them since I turned 18) and my extended family asked where they were as they have talked about how proud they are of me. I told them that I didn\u2019t invite them. When they asked why I told them about their treatment of me thru out my whole life. My grandparents on both sides, uncles, aunts and cousins said nothing. \n\nWhen the party was over I got a text from my siblings saying everyone went over to my parents house and cussed them out. I head from my brother who still lives at home that both of my parents were crying and made up excuses but they didn\u2019t get away with it as my brother confirmed everything I said. \n\nMy parents basically got disinherited from the family and I was told by my grandparents that my parents where humiliated. They also apologized for having their eyes closed for so long. \n\nI know I should feel happy that my parents got the karma they deserved but I\u2019m feeling guilty and think that I should have just told them that they were sick and couldn\u2019t attend.

You've been treated like crap for years and were just honest about your experiences. Your parents had it coming; you didn't concoct a lie, you told the truth. Yeah, it's uncomfortable now, but maybe this is the wake-up call they needed. Your family had a right to know, and it's not your fault that your parents had to face the music for their actions.", "You have a wonderful extended family and siblings. You were just honest and honestly your parents the deserved to get chewed out for their actions. You ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE. Live your life and forget about them", "NTA  they FAFO. They abused you and you told your extended family.", "NTA\n\nWell well well, if it isn\u2019t the consequence of your parent\u2019s actions. \n\nAlso well done on all your achievements", "That guilt your feeling is because of the TRAMA they put on you. You did the right thing OP.", "You have nothing to feel guilty about.  You were asked a question; you responded with the truth.  If that truth was uncomfortable for your parents, too bad.  They could have avoided this discomfort by treating you with the kindness and love you deserve as their daughter.  \n\nGood for your extended family for listening to the truth, hearing it, and standing up for you.  Too often families like to pretend that abuse never happened.  Your extended family faced the truth and dealt with it in what seems to me to be an appropriate, angry way.  \n\nWhat your parents did to your should make your extended family angry.  \n\nFurthermore, there is simply no comparison between the sustained pain of 18 years of being mistreated by your parents versus the pain your parents are experiencing now that the whole family knows the truth about what they did to you.  \n\nWarmest congratulations for not letting the negative things you were told about yourself and your future keep you down and pursuing a loving relationship with your partner, connection with your siblings and extended family, challenging university studies, and a rewarding, prestigious career.\n\nAs the poet George Herbert put it, \"To live well is the best revenge.\"\n\nKeep living well and don't look back, your future is so much more beautiful and fulfilling than your past, thanks to your own intelligence and diligence.  Bravo!\n\nNTA", "NTA!! Never lie, as a lawyer you should know the truth always comes out.", "NTA.  You told the truth in a situation where the truth was absolutely called for.", "Don't feel bad, you told the truth, your brother who probably didn't raise a fuss when younger backed you up.   \nYour parents should feel the shame they feel.", "NTA. You feel guilty because you're a person who was forced to learn empathy. Your siblings treated you poorly until they were old enough to understand and realize for themselves what happened. The extended family wasn't there like your siblings were. Now they know. \n\nI'm curious whether your parents have reached out, either since you've left or recently? Have they expressed any remorse? Have they begun to try to make amends?\n\nHonestly, the answer to those questions doesn't matter to me. You've thrived despite them. Wish you the best life possible!", "NTA - it was bound to come out at some time, OP.  You did what you felt was needed.  That was to no longer sugar coat the abuse.", "you didn't DO anything you only spoke truth sorry they thought they got away with it NTA", "NTA\n\nYou told the truth. \n\nThey're not bothered about how they treated you. They're just bothered that they got exposed and chastised.", "That you don\u2019t feel happy about this is even more evidence you are NTA. Go easy on yourself.", "Nah. The only possible reason that your parents are ashamed is because they knew they were wrong.   \nAll you did was tell the truth.   \nNTA", "NTA . I\u2019m happy that you have a family that treats you right and with respect and love. Your parents and siblings sound horrific and toxic . Block them and never talk to them ."]}
