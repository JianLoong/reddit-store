My daughter (Molly, not her name) and I had already had dinner at a restaurant after Christmas shopping but he hadn\u2019t. So I offered to make him dinner. Ron wanted to prepare something on his own, so I told him he could use our kitchen. He\u2019s done this before, is responsible and uses our equipment with care. BTW they are both 17.      \n\n\nWe get home and he walks into the kitchen\u2026 which was a mess and that\u2019s my fault. I hadn\u2019t had time to clean it up after cooking dinner the night before.      \n\n\nRon says he can\u2019t work like this and proceeds to clean up the kitchen with my daughter\u2019s help. I left the kitchen to do something else. A few minutes later I walk into the kitchen to make tea and hear my daughter say the mess is due to my procrastination. So I explain that I had been up since 3am (I work the early shift) and hadn\u2019t had time to clean the kitchen because I had other things to take care of *and* I had taken her Christmas shopping after work. She asked if I was done. I went to the living room to watch TV.      \n\n\nMinutes later Ron goes outside with the small compost bucket for kitchen scraps to dump in the large bin provided by the city. He walks back in complaining about the gunk stuck in the bottom which did not fall out. It\u2019s a mixture of coffee grounds and bacon fat so it\u2019s hard to shake out. He tells me he\u2019s going to hose it off outside. As he\u2019s leaving I remember that the outdoor hose is off because it\u2019s winter, so I yell, \u201cCome back! The hose won\u2019t work it\u2019s turned off!\u201d My daughter tells me not to yell and I tell her to tell him the hose won\u2019t work, it\u2019s winter.      \n\n\nNote: This is the second time in a week that he\u2019s expressed disgust at our kitchen scraps bucket so I\u2019m getting irked about it because I take it as a criticism whether he means it that way or not. Also the fact of his parents\u2019 kitchen always being clean is a something that he and my daughter have made a point of mentioning a few times.        \n\n\nRon returns with the bucket and Molly washes it out in the sink. When she\u2019s done washing it he comes to the living room holding the bucket explaining that he\u2019s going to put parchment (baking paper) in the bottom to prevent the gunk from sticking to the bottom again. I interrupt him and ask him to please not tell me about it because I\u2019m not interested. He continues and I ask him again not to tell me, I don\u2019t want to know. He has a puzzled expression on his face and starts again. I tell him to stop talking about it and if he cannot stop to go home because I don\u2019t want to hear about it. He stops and leaves the living room to join Molly in her room.      \n\n\nAbout 15 minutes later Ron says goodnight and leaves.      \n\nMolly has asked me to apologies to Ron and I\u2019m having a hard time convincing myself I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1702918165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ldaw3/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_boyfriend_to_go_home/", "score": 925, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You allowed him to clean up your mess, and he just tried to offer a suggestion to the compost bin issue. If you didn\u2019t want him to, then maybe you should have cleaned it yourself.

Your response clearly baffled him, and he did not pick up on needing to \"drop it\", either due to age/inexperience, or trying to show he was only being helpful. He believed he was doing a good thing, offering an easy solution to a clear problem. I would do the same thing (to my wife) if she was letting bacon grease and coffee grinds congeal in our bin. Then again, you had already turned the other cheek and perhaps were out of good cheer...and 17 year old's are dicks sometimes, whether they mean to be or not, let's not kid ourselves :P\n\nSounds like your graciousness ran out, and he was overbearing, but both of you meant well in your respective intents.", "You got into a fight with a child who was cleaning your kitchen for you.

He didn't have to rub it in your face that your kitchen is filthy and how he's having to clean it. Him also being condescending and telling you how he's doing something a certain way like he's teaching you was also rude.

Also, OP claims they dropped several hints that they didn't want to hear about the messy kitchen, and the one time they did defend themself, they were blown off (\"are you done?\").\n\nOPs daughter is being performative here. If the kitchen is always dirty, why isn't she pitching in to clean? Why is it solely OPs responsibility? Why is the daughter ONLY cleaning when her bf is over?

I understand being busy and tired and sometimes cleanup gets delayed but you let a teenager who doesn\u2019t live there clean up your mess. That\u2019s not his job. Also, you taking his comments as an insult whether or not he meant it that way is basically admitting that you\u2019re going to get offended regardless. This seems like an internal issue you need to sort out yourself. Do you carry a lot of shame around the cleanliness of your home? \n\nYour daughter saying you procrastinate may have hurt your feelings but it\u2019s not necessarily untrue. And that\u2019s not necessarily something you need to be ashamed about. I procrastinate on cleaning sometimes. Life gets busy and we all have different thresholds of how much less we can tolerate. It\u2019s not nice of them to constantly be comparing you to his family and their clean kitchen but they\u2019re teens and sometimes teens are AH. \n\nIf it bothers you so much just say that he can\u2019t use your kitchen anymore.

Yes, he should have stopped talking. I'm guessing you were pissed off at your kid for calling you a procrastinater when you really hadn't had the opportunity to clean, but then you should have taken that up with her. \n\nApologize to the BF.

Ron is probably in actual fact a pretty cool kid with a good work ethic - cleaning up at your place was a nice thing to do, he just came across as a jackass in trying to \u201ceducate\u201d you as to how to organise your own house.  Likewise with Molly, she probably just felt a bit of that teenage social pressure to look good in front of her boyfriend and ended up acting unappreciative as a result.  \n\nIf Ron and Molly can be made to understand that they\u2019re welcome to keep hanging out at your place as they have done, but they need to respect your hospitality and not take these passive-aggressive little jabs any time you leave a few pans out, then I\u2019m fairly sure this will work itself out.
