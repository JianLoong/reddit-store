My daughter (Molly, not her name) and I had already had dinner at a restaurant after Christmas shopping but he hadn\u2019t. So I offered to make him dinner. Ron wanted to prepare something on his own, so I told him he could use our kitchen. He\u2019s done this before, is responsible and uses our equipment with care. BTW they are both 17.      \n\n\nWe get home and he walks into the kitchen\u2026 which was a mess and that\u2019s my fault. I hadn\u2019t had time to clean it up after cooking dinner the night before.      \n\n\nRon says he can\u2019t work like this and proceeds to clean up the kitchen with my daughter\u2019s help. I left the kitchen to do something else. A few minutes later I walk into the kitchen to make tea and hear my daughter say the mess is due to my procrastination. So I explain that I had been up since 3am (I work the early shift) and hadn\u2019t had time to clean the kitchen because I had other things to take care of *and* I had taken her Christmas shopping after work. She asked if I was done. I went to the living room to watch TV.      \n\n\nMinutes later Ron goes outside with the small compost bucket for kitchen scraps to dump in the large bin provided by the city. He walks back in complaining about the gunk stuck in the bottom which did not fall out. It\u2019s a mixture of coffee grounds and bacon fat so it\u2019s hard to shake out. He tells me he\u2019s going to hose it off outside. As he\u2019s leaving I remember that the outdoor hose is off because it\u2019s winter, so I yell, \u201cCome back! The hose won\u2019t work it\u2019s turned off!\u201d My daughter tells me not to yell and I tell her to tell him the hose won\u2019t work, it\u2019s winter.      \n\n\nNote: This is the second time in a week that he\u2019s expressed disgust at our kitchen scraps bucket so I\u2019m getting irked about it because I take it as a criticism whether he means it that way or not. Also the fact of his parents\u2019 kitchen always being clean is a something that he and my daughter have made a point of mentioning a few times.        \n\n\nRon returns with the bucket and Molly washes it out in the sink. When she\u2019s done washing it he comes to the living room holding the bucket explaining that he\u2019s going to put parchment (baking paper) in the bottom to prevent the gunk from sticking to the bottom again. I interrupt him and ask him to please not tell me about it because I\u2019m not interested. He continues and I ask him again not to tell me, I don\u2019t want to know. He has a puzzled expression on his face and starts again. I tell him to stop talking about it and if he cannot stop to go home because I don\u2019t want to hear about it. He stops and leaves the living room to join Molly in her room.      \n\n\nAbout 15 minutes later Ron says goodnight and leaves.      \n\nMolly has asked me to apologies to Ron and I\u2019m having a hard time convincing myself I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1702918165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ldaw3/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_boyfriend_to_go_home/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you blew up at him with some passive aggressive BS.\n\nHe was trying to help, and you didn't want to hear it because I presume you feel belittled/threatened/insulted by someone thinking you're not being clean enough.\n\nSounds to me like your kitchen really is worse than you think, and they're trying to give you nudges in the right direction, and you're getting defensive over it.\n\nI think you owe them both an apology.", "YTA. You allowed him to clean up your mess, and he just tried to offer a suggestion to the compost bin issue. If you didn\u2019t want him to, then maybe you should have cleaned it yourself.

If your daughter wants to, as she lives there, fair game and you have your own relationship with her.\n\n> I interrupt him and ask him to please not tell me about it because I\u2019m not interested.\n\nThis was just rude, I think, when you could have simply said \"Makes sense!\" or something equally noncommittal, but not overtly negative. Your response clearly baffled him, and he did not pick up on needing to \"drop it\", either due to age/inexperience, or trying to show he was only being helpful. He believed he was doing a good thing, offering an easy solution to a clear problem. I would do the same thing (to my wife) if she was letting bacon grease and coffee grinds congeal in our bin. Then again, you had already turned the other cheek and perhaps were out of good cheer...and 17 year old's are dicks sometimes, whether they mean to be or not, let's not kid ourselves :P\n\nSounds like your graciousness ran out, and he was overbearing, but both of you meant well in your respective intents.", "You got into a fight with a child who was cleaning your kitchen for you.

The guy is old enough to know when he should let things go. You don't keep your kitchen as clean as his, ok he can work around it, or just quietly clean it up. He didn't have to rub it in your face that your kitchen is filthy and how he's having to clean it. Him also being condescending and telling you how he's doing something a certain way like he's teaching you was also rude. You are only human, and you already went out of your way to pick him up for your daughter after you already were doing a lot for her too.", "It\u2019s a fun age, eh?

This is his gf's mom's house. Not his. Cleaning the kitchen is super nice, but acting the way he did was, frankly, rude (\"I can't work like this!\"). Also, OP claims they dropped several hints that they didn't want to hear about the messy kitchen, and the one time they did defend themself, they were blown off (\"are you done?\").\n\nOPs daughter is being performative here. If the kitchen is always dirty, why isn't she pitching in to clean? Why is it solely OPs responsibility? Why is the daughter ONLY cleaning when her bf is over? Because she doesn't care, clearly.\n\nAlso, being a single parent of a teen with a job is hard enough without other people walking into your house and judging you. \n\nEveryone saying Y T A has no idea what they're talking about.

I understand being busy and tired and sometimes cleanup gets delayed but you let a teenager who doesn\u2019t live there clean up your mess. That\u2019s not his job. Also, you taking his comments as an insult whether or not he meant it that way is basically admitting that you\u2019re going to get offended regardless. This seems like an internal issue you need to sort out yourself. Do you carry a lot of shame around the cleanliness of your home? \n\nYour daughter saying you procrastinate may have hurt your feelings but it\u2019s not necessarily untrue. And that\u2019s not necessarily something you need to be ashamed about. I procrastinate on cleaning sometimes. Life gets busy and we all have different thresholds of how much less we can tolerate. It\u2019s not nice of them to constantly be comparing you to his family and their clean kitchen but they\u2019re teens and sometimes teens are AH. \n\nIf it bothers you so much just say that he can\u2019t use your kitchen anymore. He has a clean one at home he can use.", "You and your daughter , YTA. BF is literally trying to help. \n\nAt 17, your kid is old enough to do chores. If you get up at 3am to work and she wants her bf to come over before you've had a chance to tidy,  she should make sure the kitchen is clean. \n\nBF was trying to make a helpful suggestion.  Yes, he should have stopped talking. I'm guessing you were pissed off at your kid for calling you a procrastinater when you really hadn't had the opportunity to clean, but then you should have taken that up with her. \n\nApologize to the BF. Then tell your kid that there are new ground rules.  On days where you start wirk at 3am and then are busy, either she makes sure the house is presentable to guests, or she can't have people over.", "You told Ron to stop and he persisted.  If he doesn't like using your kitchen then he should have eaten at home.  He and your daughter are entitled and ill mannered.

You don\u2019t owe Ron an explanation as to why cleaning standards might occasionally slip at your home, and even if you did, working full time and taking care of other family business is a perfectly valid reason.\n\nI definitely don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH or that you in any way whatsoever owe Ron an apology, however I do think this is something that can probably be resolved with an honest conversation.  Ron is probably in actual fact a pretty cool kid with a good work ethic - cleaning up at your place was a nice thing to do, he just came across as a jackass in trying to \u201ceducate\u201d you as to how to organise your own house.  Likewise with Molly, she probably just felt a bit of that teenage social pressure to look good in front of her boyfriend and ended up acting unappreciative as a result.  \n\nIf Ron and Molly can be made to understand that they\u2019re welcome to keep hanging out at your place as they have done, but they need to respect your hospitality and not take these passive-aggressive little jabs any time you leave a few pans out, then I\u2019m fairly sure this will work itself out.  If not, then screw Ron, kick his ass out and don\u2019t feel bad about it!", "YTA and super rude. What was the issue with him telling you he was going to use parchment paper?

All, of course, while working full time.\n\nOf course you don't want the kitchen to be dirty, but there's a limit to your time.

Or at least be one of the cleaning. \n\nLet me guess, you expected Ron to clean up after himself had he stayed right?\n\nYTA", ">Who's the adult here?      \nNot I it would appear. Thanks for setting me straight.", "No trying to help is just doing what needs to be done without parading a compost can I to the lounge and demonstrating how to line it.  This was snotty and rude and after being told to drop it he continued the lecture then stomped off in a huff. He got off easy in my house he would have been asked to leave and banned from returning", "I am feeling threatened by it. Good point.", "I went to sit down because I had been up since 3 am. It was 7:30pm. I didn't mind cooking him something but he wanted to cook.", "After the OP had taken her out shopping instead of getting valuable sleep!", "He's really a terrific guy. His only \"fault\" is youth. Mine is a short temper and a brittle ego.      \nEDIT: What is ESH?", "Parchment paper may or may not be compostable at home, but it's commonly accepted by municipal green bin programs (and I can't imagine why it wouldn't be). Great alternative to tin foil.", "She didn't put the parchment paper in the compost though, the boyfriend did.", "I keep junk mail circulars for lining my bins, including my trash bin. Just lay down a few sheets and it keeps the bottom of the bin pretty tidy. Soaks up any leaks that might happen, and it's compostable/recyclable. It was destined for the trash anyway, might as well use it first.", "Ron is a really good guy and I'm glad for my daughter that they are together. You're right the, \"I can't work like this\" did sting. His only flaw is being a little tone deaf. However I think he is the kind of person who would probably be cool with an honest conversation. I'll give it a try. Thanks, just what I needed to get over my pride.", "Agree! I can't believe all the comments saying she's the asshole...this kid is being rude. If he politely and kindly offered to clean the kitchen or take out the bin, that would be one thing, but he's being totally passive aggressive. You're not entitled to someone else's kitchen -- if you don't like how it's kept, leave and use your own damn kitchen. No way my mom would have let a teenager criticize her housekeeping.", "Bacon grease lives in a jar on the stove, but I'm southern. We use that shit to christen babies.", "I know what you man about compost if I was putting it in my garden but my city accepts all kitchen scraps including meats. They take it all away and make compost with it.", "Just to be clear he was just cooking for himself. Molly and I had already eaten which is why I offered to cook him something. But I will put my ego aside. I'm glad I didn't get an overwhelming NTA because that would have made me even more hard hearted.", "How was he doing her a \"favor\"?  Read the post.  Ron was cooking for himself not OP or her daughter.  If the kitchen is a problem for Ron he could have eaten at home -- OR OP could have let Ron walk to their house and she could have cleaned the  kitchen with that time she spent driving him.", "Maybe the OP could use some advice on how to get their own teen to do some chores since the OP has been working the night shift.", "No she doesn\u2019t. Thats the point.", "They could have gone to his house and let the OP sleep after working since 3am and taking the teen shopping. The OP was under no obligation to provide the boyfriend with food and a kitchen. Teens don\u2019t get to choose the rules for adults, especially when it\u2019s not their own house. People who work from 3am are fucking tired. The OP did not ask for Ron or whatever his name is to come in and condescendingly try to lecture them about the food bin. That\u2019s the kind of crap you pull when you want to control someone else\u2019s space. OP, if you\u2019ve read this far, the phrase you\u2019re looking for is \u201cthank you for the advice, which I absolutely did not ask for.\u201d Op, you should ask your kid to make sure her boyfriend is fed before he comes over and for him to stay in his own lane!", "Correct. You do not seem to be much of an adult at all. You acted the most childish out of all 3 in this story.", "Ron is a gift and your daughter is lucky. Be nicer to him. I don't think the kids were assholes at all, just you.\n\n\nDon't be so filthy. Don't use 3am as an excuse. Don't let children clean up after you. Don't be so rude when someone is offering you a solution to fix the problem you created that they're cleaning up.\n\nAnd finally, FUCKING APOLOGISE TO RON.", "It\u2019s your house. You did nothing wrong. Screw these idiots who think this 17 year old little dick is your boss and owns the house. He\u2019s made tons of comments that are rude. When you said you didn\u2019t want to hear what he had to say for his 100000 criticism he didn\u2019t want to listen. Proceeded to mansplain something. You were totally in the right to tell him that. People are wild here. Imagine trying to boss others around in there house. Sure you could have handled it better. But you didn\u2019t start it. I would demand an apology from him and your daughter and lay down some rules. O and of coarse his mothers kitchen is spotless.

Both in resolving the current situation, and in helping demonstrate to the kids the proper way they should go about conflict resolution in the future.\n\nSet the example you want them to live up to.\n\nSwallow your pride, and say something to them along the lines of \"I'm sorry I blew up.  Bottom line is he's right, and I know it, but its something I've been trying to ignore and the fact that it got put out in the open when I wasn't prepared for it got me defensive.  I blew up because its something I don't like about myself but I haven't been able to bring myself to fix on my own.  I appreciate that he tried to come up with an answer that would make everyone happy, I really do.  I just wasn't prepared for it and felt put on the spot.  Maybe we can all sit down and come up with a better way to handle all of this?\"", "I wouldn\u2019t let someone use my messy kitchen. If someone wanted to use it and I was too tired to clean it up, I would have said \u2018no\u2019 when he asked to cook. It\u2019s weird that you allowed a 17 non family member  to clean everything  up", "That\u2019s kind but I\u2019d put the shutdown on it from now on. He seems to think he has a say on what and when you do things in your own house. No more kindness, he can cook for himself at home.", "It\u2019s not about cooking for him, it\u2019s about not cleaning for or with him.", "But you didn\u2019t just let him cook you let him clean up your mess", "So why would you be rude to him about the compost bucket? He was trying to be helpful.", "\"Everyone sucks here\"...sometimes people put \"NAH\" (no assholes here). \n\nI.e. it's an unfortunate situation, no one probably intended to be an asshole, but feelings were hurt all around.\n\nNo offense intended, just wanted to pick the middle ground lol!", "Nah, you are ok.  You can see that.  Don't let it ruin a good thing - talk about it.", "My green bin program won\u2019t take it. Also\u2026 tin foil isn\u2019t compostable either\u2026 what?

Like don\u2019t take the suggestion as a good one and make it a habit", "Sounds good - teenagers can be that way, wanting to do the right thing but just coming across as rude in the process, hopefully not a big deal.  Also I\u2019m glad you saw this comment, it looks like I\u2019m in the minority here but I\u2019ve never been more confident that I\u2019m right in my assessment of an AITA, so I\u2019m happy that the OP sees the sense in my points, even if the community mostly doesn\u2019t \ud83e\udd23", "You are also tone deaf you were allowed  children to clean up a mess which you admit is yours and then got mad at their frustration for cleaning your mess and then continued to get mad when presented with a solution that would help your mess not be so messy", "[deleted]", "As a fellow Canadian. Same.", "Huh. I've never heard of anything like that. Since it's winter our compost scraps are going straight into the garden and tilled in on a weekly basis.", "Do they redistribute the compost to you annually? \n\nIf not, they\u2019re not composting ish, just making the residents feel good.", "You can also tell him - \"Hey, I get your parents' house is different, but I don't like it when you complain about the state of my house.\"  I get feeling defensive if the house is messy, I do.  But also a guest should keep their mouth shut - if they want to be a guest again.", "she clearly does though... it's standard practice to put something in the compost to avoid sludge collecting at the bottom. He says he's going to do that (which she should already be doing in the first place), and is literally doing her a favour but she gets rude with him and says she doesn't want to hear about it? Like what?", "Nah, kids were extreme assholes tbh. And getting home and not having time at 3AM is a reason imho.", "He demanded to cook in the OP\u2019s kitchen and then tried to complain about their systems.

Look up cedar grove in seattle", "Look up cedar grove. They give away compost once a year and sell it otherwise to folks in the seattle area", "Agree with this take.  Going to someone else's house and complaining about the state of cleanliness is not ok.  It seems OP wouldn't have reacted badly to the whole parchment paper \"tutorial\" if he hadn't made a string of remarks (together with OP's daughter) about the fact that the kitchen was so messy.  \n\nI keep a very clean kitchen myself and have been in the same situation at friend's houses (having to clean before I could work) but wouldn't dream of saying that to them, let alone repeatedly...it's totally not necessary to embarrass them and prove how beneath my standards it is.

It happens. Your patience was already tested, and it's your house, and taking care of kids is constant work with no downtime. You're def. not the A-hole, by any stretch LOL! You also speak well of him, during and after. You clearly like the kid. If he wasn't doing it to be smarmy, or a know it all, it's probably inexperience on his part and something that will blow over :)", "A number of misconceptions here, so let's go point by point:\n\n- a kitchen crammed with dirty dishes is tough to cook in. I've said that exact phrase walking into my own kitchen after not doing my dishes. Briefly mentioning that doesn't make him an AH.\n\n-OP didn't just \"not do a few dishes,\" there was crusted on food and greasy messes that required a hose to clean. That's pretty rough to cook in.\n\n- there's no indication the kid was ungrateful. He didn't complain non-stop about the kitchen or demand something be done: he rolled up his sleeves and cleaned it himself. He even tried to share some hot tips for keeping it clean, which to me is a nice thing. \n\nSo yeah, I would and have been just fine with this behavior. A little blunt maybe, but genuinely helpful. Plus, I've been trying to grow past my childish sensitivities to neutral comments. Perhaps OP should speak to a therapist about that.", "I\u2019m not saying these services don\u2019t exist, they do.

Personally if I allowed some kid to have the run of my place, then I don\u2019t care if the entire house is smeared floor-to-ceiling in festering month old horse shit with carrion birds picking roadkill corpses clean on my lawn - the options are to be cool about it or leave.", "How are the kids AHs? For cleaning up OPs mess? For making it easier for OP to clean in the future? I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s something I missed..? OP sounds like they snapped at Ron out of embarrassment.", "Why? For making their own meals, for cleaning up a mess they didn't make, for offering solutions to prevent the mess from happening again?\n\n\nI WISH I knew teenagers like those. Helpful. Responsible. Polite. If Ron needs a job, I'm hiring.", "I'm confused how offering to clean it all up for you isn't being cool, but you do you too I guess."]}
