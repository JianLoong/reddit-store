She then got mad and told me she was already using the name. (I had no idea she was using the name) I told her I was sorry and I\u2019ll change it back. But also you need to remember that for some apps once you change your name you have to wait a couple of days to change it back, some apps are different because it could take 2 days or 30 days until you can change it back. But anyway the apps I could change my name back I did. After a couple of days she asked again to change it back and I told her that I have to wait, she got mad and I told her sorry and I\u2019ll change it back as soon as I can. But ever since that she had been asking nonstop and has been getting so mad at me. she told me that she came up with the username and that\u2019s why she was so mad, but I know she didn\u2019t because I\u2019d seen other users with the same username before. So I\u2019m thinking of just not changing the name back, I know that sounds so bad but it\u2019s just a username and she has been getting so mad at me and began to talk bad about me to other people just because of a username.\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667342570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjntcr/aita_for_using_the_the_same_username_as_my_friend/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA for lying to your friend\n\nYou knew it was her name on one app, you deliberately took it to use on a different app, and then when she confronted you, you claim that you had no idea that she was using it?\n\nPeople try to use the same username across multiple different apps... By deliberately using the same name as someone else in your social circle, you are basically impersonating your friend. It's a total AH move", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
