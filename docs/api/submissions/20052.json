All three girls are 11 and go to the same school. \n\nBella and Maddie have always been close, so close that our family jokingly calls them 'the twins'. They do the same extracurriculars at school and often have sleepovers, etc. I wasn't really surprised that when I picked the two girls up a few days ago, Maddie asked if we could have Bella come travelling with us for the summer. We always go away for pretty much the whole summer, this year will be to three countries in continental Europe. I had no problem with Bella coming along, so said I would talk to Jason about it. We agreed that Bella could come, Jason (and his ex) would cover the cost of her flights, a subsidised contribution to accommodation and give her a credit card for any expenses (obviously I will pay for most things but this is for souvenirs or emergencies). The girls are thrilled.\n\nOver the weekend I got a call from Tracy, who is upset that I didn't invite Sarah on the trip. She said it was cruel of me not to offer to take Sarah as well, since I know she has trouble socially at school as well as trouble getting along with Bella. She said me not inviting Sarah on the trip showed that we didn't think of her as family. Tracy said Sarah is devastated over this. I explained that I didn't invite anyone on this trip, Maddie did. To me, her inviting Bella is like her inviting a friend, it's not a \"family\" trip, the girls are just also friends.\n\nJason is now getting pressure from Tracy not to let Bella go on the trip if Sarah isn't going, and he says he does see the point about it being unfair and exclusionary. His ex is now arguing saying Bella should go anyway, and I agree. I think not allowing Bella to go because of Sarah is going to cause more problems between them. Jason asked if I would consider bringing Sarah on the trip as well, and I said no. This is my holiday, too, and I don't want to spend it refereeing bickering between girls who are forced to spend time together. I also don't want to be footing the bill for Sarah's trip, as Tracy has a long history of not giving Sarah a reasonable amount of money to do things and expecting whoever is around to just make up the difference.\n\nI would feel bad if Bella doesn't get to come because of this, but I don't think it's fair to anyone to take Sarah on this trip.", "created_utc": 1687174685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dc7n5/aita_for_agreeing_to_take_my_niece_on_holiday_but/", "score": 380, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As her mum, Tracy should be encouraging her in activities she enjoys and finding friends that way.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are right. Bella is invited as Maddie's particular friend\u2014something these two girls  have with each other\u2014and the invitation was Maddie's to make. Stacy is hurt but it should be explained to her that she doesn't have the same friendship with Maddie, that this will give her time to develop new friends separately from her stepsister Bella, who she has trouble getting along with, and that it is unreasonable for her to expect to go. This is what your SIL should do, but instead she wants everyone to work around her daughter's feelings for an entire summer, when she would be ruining the whole dynamic for your family. Her mom should shoulder this situation and do something special with her daughter\u2014your brother could be part of that too\u2014so that everyone wins.", "NTA. It is your trip, you take your daughter, your niece, and you don't HAVE to take anybody else.\n\nTracy doesn't get to punish your daughter because she asks to bring her cousin, especially since she knew her all her life and we don't know how long they both knew Sarah.\n\nBy the way, bringing two 11 years old on holiday is already quite a hassle, i do not even imagine having one more ! It won't be holidays anymore but babysitting all the way..BTW i wonder if it is not EXACTLY the aim of Tracy by asking you to take sarah !", "I am perplexed why Sarah would even want to go??? Agree to not punish Bella for her stepsister being awkward, this will improve with time and maturity. Tracy needs to tend to her own housekeeping and help her daughter get through an awkward time in life. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou nailed it with, \"our family jokingly calls them 'the twins'\".  Sorry Tracy, their relationship was established deep long ago and you being the way you are does not help.", "NTA. It is an unreasonable expectation for you to take on the responsibility of another child especially since the girls don\u2019t even get along.  Being together 24/7 in hotels and while touring where no one can go their own way will be a disaster.  Sarah\u2019s social issues are not your problem. And Bella was invited because she and Maddie have a friendship aside from family ties.\n\nETA: The situation will play out in one of three ways\u2026 (1) Bella will be told she can\u2019t go and both she will resent Sarah and their relationship will be worse in the end.  (2) Bella goes and Sarah is upset. But in this scenario the resentment will be towards you since you are the one who said no. (3) You agree to take Sarah. It doesn\u2019t sound like this is an option but it will not help Sarah at all to be a third wheel as the cousins\u2019 close friendship is well established.  She will feel emotionally left out.\n\nJason and Tracy need to realize that resentment between the step sisters is the worse scenario because they need to live together and be civil.", "NTA - youre exactly right, your daughter is inviting a friend with her on the trip.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that Sarah feels left out but you don\u2019t have any obligation to Sarah. As you said, your daughter wanted to bring her friend who happens to be her cousin.

Go and enjoy the trip.", "NTA. Not even IF Tracy had a good track record of paying for her daughter's expenses.  Three 11 year old's would be a total nightmare.  Also - how is Sarah going to feel when Maddie and Bella don't treat her the way they do each other?  11 year old's aren't known for their tact and I'm almost certain that Sarah is going to feel the rejection. \n\nWhat Sarah really needs is therapy to help her with her social anxiety and to teach her how to get along with others.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to deal with the fighting and footing the bill either. That puts more stress on you. It would be different if the kids actually got along.", "NTA.  If Sarah were a sibling (full or step) of a different age or gender, this wouldn't be an issue.  Would there be an assumption that an 8yr old brother must be included? Or a 16yr old sister?  Most likely not.  There is an opportunity here for your brother and wife to lean into providing some great opportunities for Sarah this summer instead of forcing her presence on this particular trip.", "NTA sucks for Sarah but it's up to the parents to make the vacation a great experience for her anyway. Not your responsibility at all, and forcing Bella to stay home too because of this would be horrible for everyone involved and everyone ends up being mad at each other", "Nta.\n I don't think bring Sarah will do any good for her. Your daughter and niece don't get along with Sarah they will not gonna be best buddy with Sarah in trip which will make Sarah feel more left out. and about money if Sarah mom don't give her enough money what she will feel when other girls bought souvenir for family and friends. I might pay for her necessary things like food and room but not for snacks or souvenir .", "nta  if Jason would have planned a trip and only took his bio daugter i would understand, but on this case nta all the way.", "NTA. it is unfortunate for sarah, i know how it is to be the odd one out. that\u2019s not your problem though, it would be miserable for everyone if they were fighting the whole time.", "NTA , but this is an unwinable situation, either way, one of the two siblings will get hurt and blame the other one.", "NTA.  Even if Bella and Tracy were twins, some times some activities are just for one.", "At the end of the day if they do not want Bella going without Sarah, that\u2019s a decision that her father is allowed to make. It\u2019ll likely cause issues, but that\u2019s their call. \n\nYou are well within reason to not want the three of them together with just you when there\u2019s already a history of not getting along. Anything done from her on out is a parental decision by Bella\u2019s parent(s). \n\nI can understand every POV and don\u2019t really see an outcome where everyone is happy here. Depending on Sarah\u2019s mental health, it may be the best decision for Jason to pull Bella from the trip. But it could also be a good lesson in being happy for other people and understanding that you will not always be invited. I have good friends that are twins and growing up they both went to most things, but learned how to handle not be invited when the other was or forking different friendships. I imagine having the same age children in the household is like this, except without that same connection.

This cutting off any mention of Sarah. \n\nTracy even said Sarah doesn\u2019t get along with Bella. So that would suck for both being away the whole summer if that\u2019s not figured out. Tracy and your brother are the ones who need to work with the girls on their relationship and try to figure out why they don\u2019t get along.\n\nI wonder if Sarah really wants to go, or if Sarah is pushing this? Have you asked your brother?\n\nTracy probably wants to be child free for the summer too? \n\nMention no to this big of a trip but if there was a smaller (one day trip) then maybe you would consider taking Sarah in the future.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNo judgement here.", "NAH\n\nThey face a dynamic you do not. They aren\u2019t wrong for a desire to have their girls treated as sisters, you aren\u2019t wrong for not for accommodating your daughter\u2019s ask. \n\nIt would be a good idea to try and work on improving relationships between the step siblings and cousin, but a vacation trip with only one parent there probably isn\u2019t the right place to do it.", "I think there are no assholes here but at the same time, everybody sucks here. \n\nI understand why you don't want to bring your step-niece along.\n\nI understand why your niece's mother wants her daughter to go.\n\nI understand why your step-niece's mother wants her daughter to go.\n\nI understand why Jason is asking you to bring both girls.\n\nBut I also think that this all sucks for the girls.", "I'm going to say NTA, you can determine who comes on a trip however you like but you certainly understand that a little girl's feelings are hurt because she feels like she's being excluded. The mother should have explained things to her but for you to act like this isn't a family trip and is just a \"friends\" trip is really ignoring the optics on your part. Being a kid is hard, being a socially awkward kid is harder and trying to fit into a blended family is even harder. The kid having to do all three is a struggle and you should, as someone who is going to have to deal with her whether you think of her as family or not which is totally on you, keep that in mind.", "I would say NAH. This seems like a case where really no one is truly in the wrong. I understand Tracy wanting Sarah to be included as she is jealous of the relationship that your daughter and Bella have. But OP, it sounds like you have a history of including Sarah in trips or outings with Maddie and Bella, and it hasn't gone well. It is your vacation, and you should be able to enjoy it without having to referee 3 11 year old girls that don't fully get along just so that one feels included. If I were Jason and Tracy, I would take Sarah on her own trip somewhere. I would also put Bella and Sarah in therapy to work out their issues.\n\nI get why Tracy is fighting to get her child included, especially because of her social struggles. I also do believe that this could hurt Sarah's feelings pretty harshly. However, it is not your responsibility to mediate this relationship and fork up additional funds. I would suggest trying to organize some time for Sarah and Maddie to hang out just the two fo them to try and nurture that relationship.", "NAH. \n\nYou really have very few options and different people will be annoyed at you depending on what option you choose. Choose the one where you think you will receive the least grief. For me, I\u2019d just stick to the your daughter and her cousin and take the crap that comes with it.", "NAH.  You had your reasons for limiting the invitation to just Bella.  Your reasons weren\u2019t inclusive, but they aren\u2019t invalid.  But Jason and Tracy have the right to make their own parenting decisions, and there is nothing wrong with the choice they made here either", "The real AH is Jason.\n\nWhy did he not discuss this with Tracy before saying OK? (also you're slightly TA if you didn't discuss it with him before inviting Bella, because you got her hopes up) Because now someone has to be the bad guy and ruin Bella's plans that were already OK'd, and she'll know the reason why, which will fundamentally damage any hope of a good relationship between her and her stepsister. Honestly, all the adults should have considered how inviting Bella would have made ~~Maddie~~ (EDIT: I meant Sarah) feel. Could you imagine being 11, and watching your sister go on an amazing vacation toruing all over Europe for the entire summer, while you're sat at home?\n\nBut also, he should be paying for his stepdaughter as well. It shouldn't only be on Tracy to give Sarah money for everything. Her bio-dad and stepdad should be stepping up more.\n\nAnd Jason hasn't come up with any alternative: he could go on a separate holiday with Tracy and Sarah to make up for her not going to Europe. Did he even think of a compromise between \"my daughter gets everything, and my stepdaughter gets nothing\"?", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. This is a tricky one, because you are perfectly justified in your reasons for wanting to take Bella, as well as your reasons for not taking Sarah as well. But, Sarah is also justified to be disappointed to be left behind while her sister goes on a trip of this magnitude, and your brother and his wife are absolutely correct that Bella going while Sarah stays behind will have a negative effect on both their relationship as step-sisters, and on Sarah\u2019s relationship with your family. So it is justifiable that they are worried about it when those relationships are already not going the way they hoped.  \n\nFrankly, there probably isn\u2019t a way to salvage it at this point. If Sarah gets left behind, she is going to be justifiably jealous and upset, and the same for Bella if she has to stay behind after being told she could go. I will say that the only opportunity for a positive outcome is if you did agree to take them both, since there\u2019s a chance all three girls could build more of a bond on a trip like this, but that isn\u2019t a guarantee either, and there\u2019s a more likely chance that they still won\u2019t like each other and Bella and Maddie could end up feeling like they had to include Sarah.  \n\nSo basically, no matter what happens, it\u2019s probably going to suck for somebody, even if that wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s intention.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her parents need to teach her now how to cope with the situation.", "YTA.  They aren't 'friends,' they are relatives.  You need to include Sarah, but with the proviso that Sarah has adequate funds for her spending.  Lay out EXACTLY what Tracy needs to provide as far as funds go.

And this is why. Is this because you are excluding the step-sister OR is it because they are friends?  \n\nIt feels exclusionary of course. All the feelings here on that side of valid.

They went on We had lots of separate friends, some mutual friends and some friends who switched between us. My best friend, that I've been friends with since we were ten started off as my twins best friend. They grew apart as teenagers and we grew closer. \n\nKids tend to invite a friend on holiday. Preferably their best friend. Family can be friends and sometimes even a best friend. Kids need to learn that just because they are (step)siblings of the same/similar age they don't automatically get an invite by the others friends.

Does Tracy expect OP to comfort her daughter at that point? Bc that's an AH move right there. \n\nIf Tracy wants Sarah to go, she needs to take her separately. Maybe the groups can meet up for some things, and then Tracy can take Sarah to do their own thing when she starts feeling left out.

The niece has two parents her MOM a and her Dad. The step mom has no right to make a choice for op\u2019s niece when the mom has no issues and wants her to go. Step mom is giving off vibes if my child can\u2019t have something nice then neither can my step child! Bio mom has every right to tell step mom to stay in her lane. \n\n\nThis a coparent decision not a step mom decision.", "I suppose Jason thought the decision was between him and his ex-wife, and honestly I\u2019d agree with that. \n\nI didn\u2019t invite Bella. I picked Maddie and Bella up from ice skating, they get in the car and Maddie says \u201ccan Bella come on holiday with us over the summer?\u201d, and they were already excited. I didn\u2019t commit to anything, I said, I\u2019ll speak to Jason, and all of us parents will discuss it. \n\nTracy and Jason share household expenses, but each take care of their own kid financially. That\u2019s how their relationship has always worked. \n\nJason is not taking any holiday time over the summer as he has recently started a business and it is very hectic, that is why Bella was not going anywhere during the summer. Her mother already took her away for Easter.", "I didn\u2019t pick and choose, my daughter invited Bella. Neither of them want Sarah to come. I don\u2019t want to spoil their holiday and my own trying to force a friendship, especially when we can\u2019t get away from each other. I think it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.", "The point is all the girls are not friends and would you expect one of Bella\u2019s friends that weren\u2019t related to take Sarah along? Do you expect that they both have the same circle of friends? Be realistic not all kids get along and life isn\u2019t fair. They would do better to teach Sarah coping skills and how to socialize with her peers. You don\u2019t always get invited not on trips, parties or anything else. How you deal with these things can increase your resiliency but if mom and dad always fix things for you the opposite happens. You don\u2019t learn to face challenges.", "I look at this as op is. If your child has a best friend. A friend that if you see your child the friend is there. (This seems to be the relationship op\u2019s daughter and neice have). Your child wants to take the best friend on holiday. However the best friend also has a twin sister that neither of the girls like. You don\u2019t really have a relationship with the twin. Are you going to tell the daughter and best friend suck it up the twin comes too? Are you going to tell your daughter and the best friend they are wrong to have a bond?  Because I wouldn\u2019t. Sorry. I am not a babysitter for one. But second that child doesn\u2019t have the same relationship with my child or my family that the best friend does.\n\n\nThis is the same situation op is in. The only difference is the best friend are cousins. I don\u2019t know about you but my sibling got to go places with my aunt and uncle with out me being invited because their child and my sibling where best friends. I want invited. I survived! I had my own group of friends. Plus me and the cousin four like cats and dogs (like in this situation) no one wanted to put us together. \n\nMy point is blended families or bio families with 2 kids have the same issue. You do not force the uninvited child on to the best friends family. It\u2019s rude and it just builds more resentment between siblings. The siblings have the right to have different friends and opportunities.", "Also, could a compromise be made?  Could Sarah come for a shorter part of the time?  And if OP agrees to take her for say a week or two of the total summer long trip, could Tracy and Jason agree to take all 3 kids for a portion of the summer so OP could have a week or two of kid free time?  This would allow the two cousins to have a good deal of time together, allow the stepsister to be partially included, allow OP to have some downtime when she\u2019s not watching kids, as well as allow Jason & Tracy to experience the joy of refereeing the 3 girls and get a taste of reality/ pragmatism OP believes they are lacking.\n\nBlended family dynamics are hard, and no one is in the wrong at this point, but there is an opportunity to meet everyone\u2019s needs if the adults act with a little grace and creativity.  OP plays a role in contributing to the stepchild\u2019s integration into the extended family, and while I understand the dilemma and wouldn\u2019t expect her to take her step-niece for the whole summer, she would be best served by exercising some empathy and compassion and modeling that as an expectation of her daughter and nieces as well (within moderation.)\n\nFinally, the two blood-related cousins are close and will likely have a great time OVERALL, but it is unrealistic to believe they won\u2019t have some spats over the course of the WHOLE summer, and that excluding the stepchild is justifiable on the basis that things will be more peaceful.  I see this in my own family.  Two of the cousins are thick as thieves for the first 3 days of our annual family camping trips.  By the 4th or 5th day, they\u2019ve had enough togetherness and start to gravitate towards other family members for some much needed space from one another.  A whole summer stuck together is a lot different from occasional weekends/ family trips.", "Maddie had already invited Bella when they got in the car when I picked them up. I said \u201cI will speak to Jason about it\u201d.", ">Maddie asked if we could have Bella come travelling with us for the summer. We always go away for pretty much the whole summer, this year will be to three countries in continental Europe. I had no problem with Bella coming along, so said I would talk to Jason about it.\n\n\n\nMaddie asked OP, who asked Jason, before inviting Tracy. Jason said yes, and made plans with his ex on how they would pay for the accommodations. I don\u2019t know where you are getting that Tracy was just invited first.", "But Jason did say yes to begin with, and also offered to pay for flights, etc. Tracy didn't call until a few days later. So it is really Tracy that put Jason in this weird position.", "OP's daughter invited her cousin on a trip they're taking.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is more Mom wants free time.", "I don't either. If anything, I can see where it can be harmful to Bella's mental health, as well as the relationships among the three. They are not just overlapping as family members. These girls not only go to the same school now (and there is no indication that is changing), but are reaching ages where their independences develop and cliques and bullying become a bigger part of their school days. Does Tracy not see she could potentially be putting a target on Sarah if the girls finally get to do what they want without parents present? Sarah has enough trouble already in the social aspect. I'm not saying Bella and Maddie will be mean, but simply excluding Sarah in front of others can snowball into bigger problems of isolation and rejecting peers (this would probably feel like school anyway). This trip would allow Bella to really let go (Maddie will always be on her side and even if invited as a friend, Bella's on a trip with family and has that security) and treat Sarah however she wants (again, not necessarily meanly, but ignoring, etc.). When they get back and Sarah talks about how miserable she was, what do we think Tracy is going to do? Even if Sarah wasn't miserable, there would be comments on how she wasn't included in enough pictures or social media posts... basically mental gymnastics to play the victim of not being treated as part of the family, not being related by blood working against Sarah, etc.\n\nMaybe they can arrange a separate trip for all three girls, not an all summer long trip. It would show the (in)compatibility if there is any and let all three feel included/equal/fairly treated. It could even become a tradition for all three if it's a feasible enough situation. And then Tracy can make sure Sarah gets her own special thing as well (she is supposedly willing to pay a bit for this trip so that money can be used to do something special) that Bella isn't a part of (Bella will be gone all summer so they have time to sort finances, time off, etc.). This could be an opportunity to show life isn't fair but how we react to it counts, as well as how it's okay to use our resources for what works for us (ask Sarah if she'd rather be a sole princess for a day or a third wheel all summer?).\n\nAlso, as Tracy has trouble paying up, OP can make sure the brother pays OP/gives Sarah enough money (same as Bella) and settles finances with his partner privately. If Bella and Sarah are supposed to be equal for fairness by OP and their family, I'm sure the money can't be \"my kid your kid\" in the brother's household. If it is, then the family can follow the example set by their own family member/connection to the people involved. \n\nJust my two cents.", "NTA- This sounds like a perfect opportunity for Sarah to learn about social boundaries, and  develop a bit of independence! Her parents should find a summer camp or something similar that suits her interests so she has something to look forward to apart from her step sister.  Then when Bella returns they both have an adventure to talk about.", "If it has been four years and the girls do still not get along I personally would consider that a problem and I would recommend family counseling to your brother. At that age the girls do not need to be instant friends and don\u2019t even need to be friends necessarily but if Sarah has not made friends of her own and is being further excluded by your niece there are likely some play ground politics happening / bad behavior on both sides and I don\u2019t think Bella should necessarily be rewarded for excluding Sarah by taking her away for the entire summer. Obviously none of this is your problem unless Maddie is contributing to personal bullying. Again not saying any of these girls are bad or that you are an asshole but four years is a long time for a joined family to still have animosity, at that age, in my opinion. Is Sarah going to get to do anything special with her side of the family? Is your brother going to take her anywhere nice? Have you considered only having Bella join for part of the trip?", "[Or a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH0Qda32IKM)", "I would like to add them when Tracy doesn\u2019t get her way she throws a tantrum and puts pressure on the niece dad to not let niece go causing a fight between coparents.
