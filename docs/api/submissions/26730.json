I'm a 35F with two kids (8M and 6F). My husband (37M) and I have been married for 10 years. My mother-in-law (62F) has always been a bit of a handful, but recently she's been downright rude to my kids, and I finally snapped. I need to know if I'm the asshole here.\r  \n\r  \nSo, my MIL comes over every other weekend to spend time with the family. Lately, she's been making snide comments to my kids that I can't ignore. For example, my son loves drawing and is really proud of his artwork. Last weekend, he showed his grandma one of his latest pieces, and she said, \"Well, it's not like you're going to be an artist or anything.\" My son was crushed.\r  \n\r  \nThen there's my daughter, who's in a \"princess phase.\" She loves wearing dresses and tiaras, and my MIL told her, \"You know, not everyone likes a girl who's too girly. Maybe try being more normal.\" My daughter was confused and asked me later what \"normal\" meant.\r  \n\r  \nI've talked to my husband about this, and he says that's just how his mom is and that she doesn't mean any harm. But I can't stand seeing my kids' faces fall when their grandma belittles them.\r  \n\r  \nSo, this past weekend, I finally had enough. My MIL made another comment, this time about my son's interest in cooking, saying, \"Boys shouldn't be in the kitchen. That's a woman's job.\" I lost it. I told her that her comments were rude, outdated, and hurting the kids. I said if she can't be supportive or at least keep her opinions to herself, she's not welcome in our home.\r  \n\r  \nNow, my husband is mad at me for \"disrespecting\" his mom and causing family drama. My MIL is telling everyone how \"ungrateful\" I am and that I'm trying to keep her away from her grandkids. I'm starting to wonder if I went too far.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for telling my mother-in-law to stop being rude to my kids?", "created_utc": 1694540039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gxkxr/aita_for_telling_my_motherinlaw_to_stop_being/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And BTW, it\u2019s funny that your husband considers you disrespectful while you\u2019re protecting your kids, when he doesn\u2019t see the malice she\u2019s causing on to them, deliberately. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re standing up against this bully called grandma. \n\nPS\nSorry that your husband was born without a spine.", "Your husband is mad that you\u2019ve allegedly disrespected his mom (you did not; you only drew your boundaries clearer and protected your kids from MIL\u2019s abusive behavior), but he\u2019s perfectly fine that his mom is disrespecting your children. \n\nThere are a very few things I detest more than older people believing they deserve higher respect because of their age. Any hierarchy, especially based on age, has to end.\n\nNTA", "Her comments are hurtful and honestly abusive. It is clear she is purposefully saying these awful things to  hurt your children. It is absolutely your responsibility as their parent to protect them from this woman. Having no grandma in their life (or only one if your mother is around) is far better and safer than having a toxic, abusive grandmother. And she's only likely to get worse towards your children, especially since your husband has not been setting any boundaries with her. \n\nHonestly your husband is TA and YWBTA if you didn't stand up for your children, prioritize their safety and wellbeing, and remove her from their lives. His lack of concern for his own children is alarming and apalling. If he's always been like this it may honestly be time to start considering separation. If there is a chance he could be reasoned with you could try explaining that by endorsing or permitting her behavior, and defending her, he is sending his children the direct message that their needs and feelings don't matter and that it is absolutely okay with him for them to be hurt. If he's okay sending that message, maybe he shouldn't be in their lives either, honestly. He could be an abusive father, just as his mother is an abusive grandmother.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If she is actively causing self-esteem issues in your children, she should not be allowed near them. Period.   \nThat's how my grandmothers were to my siblings and I, and it caused lasting issues that all of us are still battling with in our 20's. Do not let this fully grown woman bully your children. Let them draw and cook! Let them wear dresses and tiaras! Who cares if they aren't their best selves yet? They're kids!", "NTA.  Your MiL is a grown woman, and if she doesn't know how to interact with children in a nurturing and loving manner she doesn't need to be around them. It's your job to keep your children away from unhealthy influences.", "NTA\n\nShe is a bigot", "Your MIL absolutely means harm. She is being intentionally mean to little kids who are pre-programmed by instinct and familial bonds to adore her, because they don't fit her outdated views on gender. What shitty behavior. She should be ashamed of herself. \n\nAbsolutely NTA and your husband needs to wake the fuck up. This isn't going to get better by ignoring the problem. In fact, it's only going to get worse if he doesn't stand up to his mother now.", "NTA. What she's saying is rude and old-fashioned and uncalled for. The kitchen comment would have done me in too and I also would have called her out on it. Keep that sexist crap to yourself, Boomer. It also sounds like she made sure to spread her lies before the truth got out and made her look bad. \n\nStand your ground. And I would be having a serious discussion with my husband about the words his mother is saying and if that's really the messages he wants his kids to be hearing. If he can't get onboard, you have a bigger issue on your hands than just a meddling MIL.", "NTA. Your MIL is bullying your kids and your husband is allowing it. Did you have these kids before marrying him? If so, she probably thinks they don\u2019t deserve any kind words from her because they are her step grandchildren. I would document all these words and situations for future reference. Your MIL and husband are toxic", "INFO\n\nHave you had a discussion with her prior to this incident, stating how you feel and what you would like to do address the issue?\n\nI 100% understand why you would be upset with the things she says to your kids, but if you haven't communicated that to her already, you're part of the issue. And blowing up on someone, regardless of whether or not it's justified, is going to illicit a negative reaction. I suggest you sit down with your mother-in-law and have a discussion about your own actions as well as hers. This is the only way to move forward.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
