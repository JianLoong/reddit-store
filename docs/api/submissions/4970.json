I said that had he asked, I would\u2019ve let him.

Like damn I get he had a bad tone, but it was because of her bad attitude. Was he supposed to ask to take a dump too so he wouldn\u2019t use up the flush and toilet paper?

I think he just didn\u2019t want to ask to not bother her because it is a common courtesy after something like that, he didn\u2019t expect her to react that way and was just annoyed. Also he can hold last nights things over her because that is probably the reason he wanted to shower. He didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal since she let him in and trusted him enough with her body, to be mad about a shower just blew it out of proportion and got him hostile because it was a hostile situation to him.", "But why do you need to ask?

It is absolutely standard procedure to let your hookup shower at your place even if they don't spend the night, but ESPECIALLY if they do.

YTA, I get you feel like your space was invaded, but you invited him into it, and his behavior is socially acceptable considering the situation.", "How is it not good manners that a shower is part of the hosting of sex? Even without the overnight stay imo. \n\nIt's a shower. It's not like he asked to trim his pubes with her razor. He asked to stand under some running water to wash off the sex dirt. It's not like it could have been anything other than a simple wash since he had to put on the same clothes. If he had an overnight bag because the stay over was pre-planned then op hopefully wouldn't be here...\n\nOp, if you're going to host people to come have sex with you from a ways away then make sure you have guest bodywash if that's what irritated you.
