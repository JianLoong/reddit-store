{"id": 21833, "submission_id": "14vrryf", "title": "AITA M/21 for telling my older brother M/34 that his Wife F/28 is not my responsibility?", "selftext": "\nI (M 21 college student) and my twin brother live in an Apartment Building together with my parents. My older brother (34M) lives in the same building but in a different apartment.\n\nI actually have an okay relationship with my older brother, me and my twin brother go to his place to play some games hang out or simply just have takeout together.\n\nMy older brother didn\u2019t have a real relationship ever and just this February he introduced her Girlfriend (28F) to us. They were dating for 8 months and already decided their whole future. She lives an hour and a half drive away making my brother driver to her place almost everyday even after work.\n\nHer parents didn\u2019t want them to live together unless they are married which might also explain why they married so quickly. \n\nNow what was a little strange to me is that my brother always asked me to come over and hang out with them. I didn\u2019t want to always interfere in their relationship and wanted them to live together, figure out their own routines and daily lives without me. Even one time when I said I don\u2019t want to hang out right now, he found that strange because I used to always come to his place when he called me but he wasn\u2019t married and living with another person back then.\nHe says that this is his way to relax and unwind when me and my twin brother come over and play video games together.\n\nJust yesterday they brought me and my brother over to have a talk and told us that she is feeling left out by us. He talked for her and said that maybe if I go for a walk or something that I could also take her with me. I told him that this is not really my responsibility and that you as a husband should do that. I told him that we can hang out in the weekend or stuff all together but not just alone with her and almost everyday because that would just be draining for me. \n\nHe said that they don\u2019t really know what to do together because it seems like they don\u2019t really have a common hobby that they can pursue together. When he is playing video games she doesn\u2019t know what to do and how to entertain herself. \nNote that she doesn\u2019t work because she said that she is currently unable to work. (Even though they are in desperate need for money now after the wedding)\n\nWe don\u2019t really know that well each other and she makes me feel like we are besties and that we are sooo alike and that she already misses me after a couple of days of not seeing each other, even though we don\u2019t even really know each other?!!\n\nAlso I don\u2019t see my brother happy. \n\nAfter setting all these boundaries and telling them that I don\u2019t want to hang out with them all the time and need time for myself he told me afterwards that my reaction towards her was very rude and off and that I am responsible too of keeping the family together. Aita in this situation for setting my boundaries and telling him that she is not my responsibility?", "created_utc": 1688989687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vrryf/aita_m21_for_telling_my_older_brother_m34_that/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They need to find things they can do together.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry to say it and hopefully not overstepping a line but it sounds like they rushed a relationship without having set up solid foundations in the first place an now you are being used a resource to distract from the fact they just aren't correctly aligned to each other.\n\nI may be reading between the lines too much but it feels like you are aware of this too.\n\nJust do what makes you comfortable but by no means feel guilt for not spending massive amounts of time with them.", "NTA. This sounds really messed up. You have no obligation or responsibility to keep the family together or entertain or engage with HIS wife. Why did your brother marry this woman who he doesn't know what to do with?", "NTA. His expectations are very unreasonable.", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to appease your SIL. It is an unfortunate mess your older brother got himself into. You should not have to worry about his wife's needs, that's his responsibility. Tell your brother how you feel if you haven't already.", "NTA - you don't have to besties with his wife, and it makes sense you hang out a bit less now that he is married.\n\nHe needs to figure out things to do with his wife, she also needs to figure out how to keep herself busy at least some of the time without relying on you and your brother. \n\nHowever, she has just moved, and it makes sense she is struggling a bit, so do have some compassion. But encourage your brother to encourage her to find a sports club, workout group, gaming group, birdwatching club, book club, idk what she's into, but he should try to help her find something to do in a community.", "NTA\nYou're being very reasonable with the boundaries you have set and I wouldn't back down when its going to make you uncomfortable. It seems like your brother is using you and your twin brother as a buffer in their relationship which isn't the best sign in a marriage especially in the first part where usually newlyweds would be want alone. Couples therapy sounds needed. Also, I understand she wants to get to know the family better but she need go to family gatherings and get to know everyone gradually rather the pressure of one to ones. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA, you didn't refuse to hang out with her entirely and simply asked to not always be there with them. you have no responsibility to keep HIS family together nor to make sure his wife is constantly happy and relaxed, that's his responsibility only.", "That's a weird sitch man. You're not wrong, it's not your responsibility to stabilise his marriage. Like hanging out with her, go out on a walk with her ... wtf? Weird.\n\nMost you can do is get a multiplayer game that can accommodate 4 that's easy for a new player like Smash. \n\nNTA", "This is weird - did she not have friends before they got together? You set a pretty reasonable boundary and they are upset about it anyway. That shows a lack of maturity on their part in being unable to respect a no.\n\nIt sounds like she has attachment issues (as someone with BPD looking it up might help - even if she doesn't have BPD it sounds like she might have some of the behaviours of the disorder and it might help in understanding some of her attachment behaviours)\n\nNTA", "Brother is 34 and didn't have the spine to tell his patents to butt out. Marry in haste, repent at leisure. Are his parents also going to insist he can't get a divorce because they don't approve of that either? \n\nHis relationship with her is his problem, and boy is it a problem if they have nothing in common, she is unable or unwilling to entertain herself, and neither is trying very hard to find common ground. \n\nNTA, and besides being polite and trying to get to know her *IN A GROUP SETTING, NOT ALONE*, the rest is your brother's problem. Maybe I've been on reddit too long, lol, but alarm bells started blaring when I read:\n\n>We don\u2019t really know that well each other and she makes me feel like we are besties and that we are sooo alike and that she already misses me after a couple of days of not seeing each other, even though we don\u2019t even really know each other?!!", "> When he is playing video games she doesn\u2019t know what to do and how to entertain herself\n\nPerhaps she could try whatever she's been doing for the past 28 years. \n\nNTA your brother married someone who needs a babysitter. That's his problem.", "NTA, but I feel like you are using \"Time to yourself\" as a cover for something else, possibly you not liking her, or resentment towards them getting married/living together or whatever.  If you were always down for hanging before, and now you need \"Time to yourself\" it does seem very sus.  Perhaps you have changed, and if thats the case that is a conversation that could be had, but I am guessing your brother is getting the same feeling I am (That you do not like his wife, and dont want to hang out because of that) and is trying to get you to spend time together in an effort to build that relationship so he can go back to hanging with his brothers like he used to.", "NTA, but you could try to build the relationship for your brothers sake. It sort of reads that your punishing your brother for marrying quickly by isolating him and denying him time with you. At the end of the day, your boundaries are reasonable, but it might be worth looking at the bigger picture (yours and your brothers long term relationship) and prioritise that", "YTA Asking you to hang out with her isn't asking you to be responsible for her. He wants to still spend time with you, and you are pushing him away.", "NTA. She sounds like she has no friends or interests but that isn\u2019t your problem.", "My theory is they had great sex but now that they live together the novelty has worn off.", ">Time to yourself\" it does seem very sus\n\n\nExactly why? That is what Op wants. It isn't on him to explain further for a couple. THEY should figure themselves out. \n\nAlso, ever heard of introverts? Yeah. We exist. \nWe may tolerate immediate family but new relationships... It really does take time and a whole lot of SMALL doses.\n\nDoes not always have anything to do with liking or not liking a person so maybe check your assumptions", "This. Like OP isn't obligated to hang out but it seems odd to me that him being married means OP won't go over there despite being invited. \n\nOP saying they won't go over when invited because they need to figure there stuff out as a couple is taking responsibility for their relationship in a way nobody asked him to do but then acts like being asked to get to know the wife some is somehow taking responsibility for her? Idk I find the take of OP and those on this post weird.\n\nI do think the brothers relationship sounds sus too but it doesn't even seem relevant to this post.", ">but you could try to build the relationship for your brothers sake. It sort of reads that your punishing your brother for marrying quickly by isolating him and denying him time with you\n\n\nDoesn't read that way at all. \n\nOp is saying he doesn't have much in common with his brother's wife and brother is trying to make him her entertainment. \n\nThe fact that Op likes hanging out with his brother maybe more down to having known him far longer and it doesn't sap his energy as much especially because brother isn't using him for entertainment. New relationships take energy and Op is not an A H for not having the bandwidth. \n\nBrother's wife is 28. She can and should entertain herself or seek means to do so. Her husband can also work with her on it. \n\nExpecting someone to include you all the time just because you are married to their brother is absurd. Op is 21. A male. What much in commonality should he have with his brother's wife that she now feels \"excluded\" And misses him if he doesn't see her in 2 days? \n\nWeird shit and none on Op", "This screams: they're gonna have a baby to save the marriage.", "My theory is they had sex. Not necessarily great sex, but the first sex either had had, at least on the regular basis.\n\nOtherwise it seems they have nothing in common.", "I understand introvert status, this post just did not scream \"Introvert\" to me.  This statement:  \n\"My older brother didn\u2019t have a real relationship ever and just this February he introduced her Girlfriend (28F) to us. They were dating for 8 months and already decided their whole future. She lives an hour and a half drive away making my brother driver to her place almost everyday even after work.\"\n\nScreamed resentment.  This is not a relevant point to someone wanting \"time alone\" because they are an introvert.  This statement is needed to position the now-wife in bad light by \"**Making** my brother drive to her place\".", "I said he\u2019s NTA and that his boundaries were reasonable. \n\nBut also gave an opinion on building relationships with his new family member."]}
