My older brother (34M) lives in the same building but in a different apartment.\n\nI actually have an okay relationship with my older brother, me and my twin brother go to his place to play some games hang out or simply just have takeout together.\n\nMy older brother didn\u2019t have a real relationship ever and just this February he introduced her Girlfriend (28F) to us. They were dating for 8 months and already decided their whole future. She lives an hour and a half drive away making my brother driver to her place almost everyday even after work.\n\nHer parents didn\u2019t want them to live together unless they are married which might also explain why they married so quickly. \n\nNow what was a little strange to me is that my brother always asked me to come over and hang out with them. I didn\u2019t want to always interfere in their relationship and wanted them to live together, figure out their own routines and daily lives without me. Even one time when I said I don\u2019t want to hang out right now, he found that strange because I used to always come to his place when he called me but he wasn\u2019t married and living with another person back then.\nHe says that this is his way to relax and unwind when me and my twin brother come over and play video games together.\n\nJust yesterday they brought me and my brother over to have a talk and told us that she is feeling left out by us. He talked for her and said that maybe if I go for a walk or something that I could also take her with me. I told him that this is not really my responsibility and that you as a husband should do that. I told him that we can hang out in the weekend or stuff all together but not just alone with her and almost everyday because that would just be draining for me. \n\nHe said that they don\u2019t really know what to do together because it seems like they don\u2019t really have a common hobby that they can pursue together. When he is playing video games she doesn\u2019t know what to do and how to entertain herself. \nNote that she doesn\u2019t work because she said that she is currently unable to work. (Even though they are in desperate need for money now after the wedding)\n\nWe don\u2019t really know that well each other and she makes me feel like we are besties and that we are sooo alike and that she already misses me after a couple of days of not seeing each other, even though we don\u2019t even really know each other?!!\n\nAlso I don\u2019t see my brother happy. \n\nAfter setting all these boundaries and telling them that I don\u2019t want to hang out with them all the time and need time for myself he told me afterwards that my reaction towards her was very rude and off and that I am responsible too of keeping the family together. Aita in this situation for setting my boundaries and telling him that she is not my responsibility?", "created_utc": 1688989687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vrryf/aita_m21_for_telling_my_older_brother_m34_that/", "score": 825, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is an unfortunate mess your older brother got himself into. You should not have to worry about his wife's needs, that's his responsibility. Tell your brother how you feel if you haven't already.", "NTA - you don't have to besties with his wife, and it makes sense you hang out a bit less now that he is married.\n\nHe needs to figure out things to do with his wife, she also needs to figure out how to keep herself busy at least some of the time without relying on you and your brother. \n\nHowever, she has just moved, and it makes sense she is struggling a bit, so do have some compassion. But encourage your brother to encourage her to find a sports club, workout group, gaming group, birdwatching club, book club, idk what she's into, but he should try to help her find something to do in a community.", "NTA\nYou're being very reasonable with the boundaries you have set and I wouldn't back down when its going to make you uncomfortable. It seems like your brother is using you and your twin brother as a buffer in their relationship which isn't the best sign in a marriage especially in the first part where usually newlyweds would be want alone. Couples therapy sounds needed. Also, I understand she wants to get to know the family better but she need go to family gatherings and get to know everyone gradually rather the pressure of one to ones. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA, you didn't refuse to hang out with her entirely and simply asked to not always be there with them. you have no responsibility to keep HIS family together nor to make sure his wife is constantly happy and relaxed, that's his responsibility only.", "That's a weird sitch man.

You set a pretty reasonable boundary and they are upset about it anyway. That shows a lack of maturity on their part in being unable to respect a no.\n\nIt sounds like she has attachment issues (as someone with BPD looking it up might help - even if she doesn't have BPD it sounds like she might have some of the behaviours of the disorder and it might help in understanding some of her attachment behaviours)\n\nNTA", "EDIT: oops, it was the wife's parents, so edited to fix that. \n\nWife is 28 and didn't have the spine to tell her patents to butt out. Marry in haste, repent at leisure.

If you were always down for hanging before, and now you need \"Time to yourself\" it does seem very sus.  Perhaps you have changed, and if thats the case that is a conversation that could be had, but I am guessing your brother is getting the same feeling I am (That you do not like his wife, and dont want to hang out because of that) and is trying to get you to spend time together in an effort to build that relationship so he can go back to hanging with his brothers like he used to.", "NTA, but you could try to build the relationship for your brothers sake.

That is what Op wants. It isn't on him to explain further for a couple. THEY should figure themselves out. \n\nAlso, ever heard of introverts? Yeah. We exist. \nWe may tolerate immediate family but new relationships... It really does take time and a whole lot of SMALL doses.\n\nDoes not always have anything to do with liking or not liking a person so maybe check your assumptions", "This. Like OP isn't obligated to hang out but it seems odd to me that him being married means OP won't go over there despite being invited. \n\nOP saying they won't go over when invited because they need to figure there stuff out as a couple is taking responsibility for their relationship in a way nobody asked him to do but then acts like being asked to get to know the wife some is somehow taking responsibility for her? Idk I find the take of OP and those on this post weird.\n\nI do think the brothers relationship sounds sus too but it doesn't even seem relevant to this post.", ">but you could try to build the relationship for your brothers sake. It sort of reads that your punishing your brother for marrying quickly by isolating him and denying him time with you\n\n\nDoesn't read that way at all. \n\nOp is saying he doesn't have much in common with his brother's wife and brother is trying to make him her entertainment. \n\nThe fact that Op likes hanging out with his brother maybe more down to having known him far longer and it doesn't sap his energy as much especially because brother isn't using him for entertainment. New relationships take energy and Op is not an A H for not having the bandwidth. \n\nBrother's wife is 28. She can and should entertain herself or seek means to do so. Her husband can also work with her on it. \n\nExpecting someone to include you all the time just because you are married to their brother is absurd. Op is 21. A male. What much in commonality should he have with his brother's wife that she now feels \"excluded\" And misses him if he doesn't see her in 2 days? \n\nWeird shit and none on Op", "This screams: they're gonna have a baby to save the marriage.", "My theory is they had sex.

Was it rushed?", "It sounds like she has been extremely sheltered her entire life.  28 and doesn\u2019t know how to entertain herself?  What would she have done if she still lived at home?  I can see it being hard to entertain herself all day and wanting to spend time with people. \nYour NTA, and see if you can\u2019t find/suggest things she might like doing. Help your brother out a little as it seems like they may not have known each other as well as they should have. Or maybe she needs to be told that you\u2019re still you and we are still us. But you didn\u2019t loose you to become an us. Your hobbies are still important. She needs to find herself again in a new city. But cut her some slack because it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s had a lot of time to explore and be comfortable with living there before they married and she moved.", "[removed]", "Why does she miss her husband's little brother so much?", "NTA. Take a 2-3 week from going over to their home or hanging out. Let them be alone long enough to discover their interest and not hide behind you, let him step up and go out and make friends or find hobbies, let her step up and get a job or go do some classes or volunteering. By completely disappearing you will force them to deal with this. Also you are not their entertainment nor her boyfriend.", "NTA!  \nThey both need to grow up. You, as a 21 y.o. student have more maturity in your little finger than they have.   \nSeriously, is it too late to get an annulment? Not only do they admit to having nothing in common they don't seem capable of navigating any kind of an adult friendship with each other. You are not her nanny.  \nI don't know why she can't work but if that's legit maybe she could at least take a class or 2 to occupy herself.", "NTA - seeing them at the weekend is more than enough if that is what you want. I would suggest to them to try new things together to see if they find anything in common. And/or suggest to her that she needs to find something to do when he\u2019s gaming. What would she like to do for a hobby? Reading, exercising alone or class, arts and crafts, etc. it\u2019s not up to you to entertain them or fill the void in their relationship. At 8 months if marriage things should be different. It seems they rushed it for the wrong reasons. Her finding a job could also be a good thing. Looks like she\u2019s bored at home and has no friends around her. She needs to go out and make friends in the area.", "NTA. Don\u2019t hang out with her alone. OP, sounds like she has a crush on you. Also, go low contact with them while they sort out their doomed relationship", "NTA. Your brother's new wife is an adult. She can find ways of entertaining herself. It also just sounds so weird to me that they were dating for 8 months, got married and then find out they don't have anything in common. What did they do for 8 months?", ">that I am responsible too of keeping the family together\n\nYes she is family.  HIS FAMILY.\n\nHE married her. Not you.\n\nHE needs to figure out how to make her happy.\n\nSHE needs to figure out what makes her happy in her marriage to him.\n\nTHEY need to figure out common interests.\n\nTHEIR relationship has NOTHING to do with you.\n\nYou are not an entertainment, nor a prop, nor an emotional substitute for their lack of knowledge on what they failed to do regarding their own marriage. Yeesh\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey rushed into a marriage with nothing in common by the sound of it.", "It looks like they got married before they really knew each other.  Best wishes to them.\n\nYou are NOT responsible foe keeping the family together.  He just doesn't want to spend time with her as he prefers to play his games.  Not your circus, not your monkeys.", "NTA. If they don\u2019t know how to interact with each other is not your responsibility to act as a buffer or entertainment.", "NTA. You seem to be more aware of their dynamics than they are. It's not your responsibility to entertain your unemployed SIL. Your brother married a woman he doesn't know as he can't seem to figure out what to do without his younger brothers. Neither of them knows each other. Not your problem. You weren't rude or off-putting at all. She needs to get a job so she can make some friends. They need to talk about their likes and dislikes to find common ground to do things together. All of which are not your problem. NTA at all.", "It sounds like your brother is in over his head in his marriage.  You do not need to be the social lubricant with his wife and him.\n\nThy need to work out their own marriage and if they need a third party, going to a therapist would be a wise choice.  NTA", "Nta. You aren't there for her entertainment. Sje needs to do her own thing", "NTA, big red flag that they cannot find a hobby to do together\u2026", "Well this is odd. What did they do together when he had to drive that far to see her (besides the obvious)? \n\nNTA, and maybe for the next holiday you could buy them a cooking class or dance lessons or something. But no, spending time with her is not your responsibility and certainly not on you to \u201chold the family together.\u201d", "His wife is his responsibility. He thinks that since he had to follow the rules of the family and not live with her prior to marriage, he thinks then that the family will follow the rules of helping with his family. This is all that \"family\" crap that is leveraged to get people to follow their rules. You are not responsible for his wife and it's not expected of siblings to become besties with in-laws. This is weird and it's not on you. Especially at your age. NTA", "Encourage Big Brother to spend less time on video games and more time on getting to know the woman he married. Tell them to try to find some common interests, go for walks and introduce the wife to her new neighborhood. Maybe try to make some friends their own age--there's a 13 year old age gap between the brothers and the younger ones shouldn't be responsible for babysitting their older sister-in-law.  OP is definitely NTA. Big Bro & Wifey need to start building a life of their own among their peers.", ">He said that they don\u2019t really know what to do together because it seems like they don\u2019t really have a common hobby that they can pursue together. When he is playing video games she doesn\u2019t know what to do and how to entertain herself.\n\nWhy does it sound like the entire brainstorming session for this was just like: \n\nBrother: \"I like video games\"\n\nWife: \"I don't ...\"\n\nBrother: \"Whelp, I guess we have nothing in common!\"", "I mean, seriously, SIL is sounding flirty and brother is trying to throw her at OP to get her out of his hair so he can play video games? This is terrible family drama in the making and OP has very good instincts telling him to stay clear of the whole mess.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "And look into moving out of that building and create more space away from them.", " As for you, bottom line, you have no obligation to hang out with your brother, you did it on your own because you had fun and were comfortable, but the moment that changed you don't have to go if you don't want to.", "It seems like she has nothing in common with her husband but feels like she does with you. You don't want any opportunity for her to try and dump your brother because she's in love with you.", "She lived 90 minutes away.  3 hours round trip to hang out while the brother is playing video games is probably a bit much for people in their late 20's with their own lives and families.", "[removed]", "Your brother made the mistake of marrying someone that he doesn't know so he has to deal with that", "She's moved away from all her friends and family and upended her life to marry the brother. That isn't OP's doing or responsibility and the brother needs to do far more than just play video games and shrug but it would be a kindness to help her settle in and feel welcomed by his family.", "I had to look at the ages again. Like, how the fuck do you not have your own personality at 28?", "My alarm bells went off too! It\u2019s like she\u2019s bored with her now husband and probably had those same feelings of infatuation for OP\u2019s brother that she now has for OP. \n\nInfatuation does not bode well for a long-term relationship, let alone a marriage.", "Puzzles make good gifts. js", "Her friends and interests are a 90 minute car ride away.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
