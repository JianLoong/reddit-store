{"id": 23857, "submission_id": "15hz8y4", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for refusing to split half of the check for dinner with my best friend like we usually do.", "selftext": "Firstly, thank you for all the advice and understanding from my first post, which can be found on my profile. \n\nBut to quickly recap, Vanessa, my best friend, and I have agreed to always split the check in half no matter how much we ordered. She recently got promoted and took us to a trending spot to which I've never gone to before. The check ended up being a total $560, out of which I had only ordered around $145. \nThis has always been the ratio in almost every dinner, brunch, or lunch because she not only has a bigger appetite, she will also sometimes order the more expensive items while I have a smaller appetite. BEFORE we ordered, I had told her that I will be paying for my own food only, to which she had said \"okay\". But after we had eaten and she saw that I actually was paying for my food only, she said she thought I was joking about paying for my own food only and said \"she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew I was being serious\". \nEnded up with her saying \"fine then, I'll pay for my own food\" and then she left without me. \nI felt like I was an asshole for doing that on her promotion day instead of having a conversation about it some time before, but honestly I never had a chance to bring it up and after my sister had mentioned that I shouldn't be paying half when our orders were so unbalanced I couldn't continue to do it anymore.\n\nAnyway, Vanessa has apologized for being mad and abandoning me at the restaurant because of the fight that we had, knowing that she had picked me up since my car was being fixed and I had to Uber home. \nI told her that since she had the promotion, she had to treat me to dinner and pay for the both of us like other friends do, to which she agreed and said that in order to make up for it she will take me out to dinner and pay for the entire meal. Which she did last night and she stayed true to her word and even told me that I can order whatever I want no matter the price. \nWe also had a long conversation about future dinners and stuff and we agreed to pay for our own food and get separate checks unless either one of us wants to pay for the entire dinner in the case of a promotion, celebration, or et cetera. \n\nI also want to address the male comments claiming that she's fat and we eat too much as women. First, we're both very fit and stromg. I'm 5'7 and she's 5'9. Second, the $560 was because it was an expensive place, so if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant. \n\nAnyway, the conclusion is, we resolved the problem and I greatly appreciate all the good advice and comments.", "created_utc": 1691153475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hz8y4/update_aita_for_refusing_to_split_half_of_the/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Good to hear that she apologized to you.\n\nBut just keep in mind that she was deliberately taking advantage of you. Your split-agreement was made based on convenience, but she directly admitted that she was taking advantage of the agreement and ordered more food than she would if she had to pay for it herself. You paying for more than your share was therefore not a coincidence. It was an active choice by her.\n\nSo my question is: Has she apologized for taking advantage of you? Because that's no way to treat a friend.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a657l/aita_for_refusing_to_split_half_of_the_check_for/)", "Good to hear you two aorked it out and the friendship continued :) \n\nAnd dont Listen to the mean comments. It is the Internet, it is way to easy for people to be nasty for no reason other than being nasty. I think even addressing them and their commeents is a waste of time ;) Focus on tue productive parts.", "NTA obviously, and glad she apologized.  The main issue I have with is:  I never would have ordered so much if I knew we weren't splitting the bill.\n\nWhat?  So basically she just expects you to subsidize her meals?  That is obnoxious.", "Or has she taken advantage of OP in other ways as well?", "I know it's a typo, but now I picture two birds aorking it out with vigorous squawks.", "I commented on your first post saying that Vanessa was not a good person for using you. I'm very happy that level heads and open communication won out, and that Vanessa recognised her behaviour. \n\nI'm glad you're both taking steps to deal with your conflict and continue your friendship. Congratulations!", "Glad you worked it out. And you don\u2019t owe AH men any explanation of your food intake, ever.", "The power of communication. Great update. Thanks for sharing.", "As someone who has waited tables I\u2019ve never had a problem splitting checks for small groups, especially if I was given a heads up beforehand.\n\nAlso, everyone I\u2019ve known who has insisted on splitting checks evenly has proceeded to order significantly more than everyone else. I budget and try to be as thrifty as possible. In the age of Venmo there is no good reason to split checks down the middle.\n\nLastly:\n\n>we\u2019re both fit and strong. I\u2019m 5\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u20199.\n\nI assume OP intended to expand on this, but using height as the sole indicator of someone\u2019s health and strength made me laugh.", "Congratulations! Good work.", "Okay but is those so called friends that came at you have apologized already? That shouldn\u2019t even have happened to begin with. While this is a great update, her first reaction is act like that need to be cautious with. Especially running to your other friends to make you out to be the bad person. Don\u2019t be all too rainbows and sunshine yet.", "She specifically mentioned that had she known that you were each paying for your own food, she would have ordered differently. Why do still want to be friends with her. The fact that she apologized is moot. It is the thought process behind it that is disgusting.", "I kind find any reference to calories of your meals, making the guys commenting you eat too much really funny. what a bunch of twats.", "I had a friend like that and cutting her off has been such a blessing.", "Honestly YTA for putting yourself in a position you can't afford, and she is also TA for assuming someone would pay for her food. Girl that is 8 course meal with wine pairing Michelin restaurant price! If you are fighting over a bill you should financially not be going to those places, period. I go out to fine dining with my partner often and gets apps, multiple drink, and entrees plus a hefty tip and NEVER has it EVER come close to $500! Even if it's an outrageously expensive restaurant and two people have THREE $20 drinks, a $30 app each, and say somehow entrees are $50, and you tip 20% and meal tax, you still arent reaching even $400! This story doesn't add up. Please link where in the world you are ordering a la carte at those prices. A $500+ meal for two people should be impossible unless it is a tasting menu/ multi course prixe fix meal.", "Absolutely I'd love to see OP do some basic maths on how much she has subsidised her friend over the years.\n\nThe friend is getting off light if one meal is enough to make up for years of taking advantage of her generousity.", "I don\u2019t think the height was meant to indicate health or strength, only size, which usually also adds to a person\u2019s appetite."]}
