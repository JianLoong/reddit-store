{"id": 23857, "submission_id": "15hz8y4", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for refusing to split half of the check for dinner with my best friend like we usually do.", "selftext": "Firstly, thank you for all the advice and understanding from my first post, which can be found on my profile. \n\nBut to quickly recap, Vanessa, my best friend, and I have agreed to always split the check in half no matter how much we ordered. She recently got promoted and took us to a trending spot to which I've never gone to before. The check ended up being a total $560, out of which I had only ordered around $145. \nThis has always been the ratio in almost every dinner, brunch, or lunch because she not only has a bigger appetite, she will also sometimes order the more expensive items while I have a smaller appetite. BEFORE we ordered, I had told her that I will be paying for my own food only, to which she had said \"okay\". But after we had eaten and she saw that I actually was paying for my food only, she said she thought I was joking about paying for my own food only and said \"she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew I was being serious\". \nEnded up with her saying \"fine then, I'll pay for my own food\" and then she left without me. \nI felt like I was an asshole for doing that on her promotion day instead of having a conversation about it some time before, but honestly I never had a chance to bring it up and after my sister had mentioned that I shouldn't be paying half when our orders were so unbalanced I couldn't continue to do it anymore.\n\nAnyway, Vanessa has apologized for being mad and abandoning me at the restaurant because of the fight that we had, knowing that she had picked me up since my car was being fixed and I had to Uber home. \nI told her that since she had the promotion, she had to treat me to dinner and pay for the both of us like other friends do, to which she agreed and said that in order to make up for it she will take me out to dinner and pay for the entire meal. Which she did last night and she stayed true to her word and even told me that I can order whatever I want no matter the price. \nWe also had a long conversation about future dinners and stuff and we agreed to pay for our own food and get separate checks unless either one of us wants to pay for the entire dinner in the case of a promotion, celebration, or et cetera. \n\nI also want to address the male comments claiming that she's fat and we eat too much as women. First, we're both very fit and stromg. I'm 5'7 and she's 5'9. Second, the $560 was because it was an expensive place, so if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant. \n\nAnyway, the conclusion is, we resolved the problem and I greatly appreciate all the good advice and comments.", "created_utc": 1691153475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hz8y4/update_aita_for_refusing_to_split_half_of_the/", "score": 926, "replies": ["Good to hear that she apologized to you.\n\nBut just keep in mind that she was deliberately taking advantage of you. Your split-agreement was made based on convenience, but she directly admitted that she was taking advantage of the agreement and ordered more food than she would if she had to pay for it herself. You paying for more than your share was therefore not a coincidence. It was an active choice by her.\n\nSo my question is: Has she apologized for taking advantage of you?

The main issue I have with is:  I never would have ordered so much if I knew we weren't splitting the bill.\n\nWhat?  So basically she just expects you to subsidize her meals?  That is obnoxious.", "Or has she taken advantage of OP in other ways as well?", "I know it's a typo, but now I picture two birds aorking it out with vigorous squawks.", "I commented on your first post saying that Vanessa was not a good person for using you. I'm very happy that level heads and open communication won out, and that Vanessa recognised her behaviour. \n\nI'm glad you're both taking steps to deal with your conflict and continue your friendship. Congratulations!", "Glad you worked it out. And you don\u2019t owe AH men any explanation of your food intake, ever.", "The power of communication. Great update. Thanks for sharing.", "As someone who has waited tables I\u2019ve never had a problem splitting checks for small groups, especially if I was given a heads up beforehand.\n\nAlso, everyone I\u2019ve known who has insisted on splitting checks evenly has proceeded to order significantly more than everyone else. I budget and try to be as thrifty as possible. In the age of Venmo there is no good reason to split checks down the middle.\n\nLastly:\n\n>we\u2019re both fit and strong.

Good work.", "Okay but is those so called friends that came at you have apologized already? That shouldn\u2019t even have happened to begin with. While this is a great update, her first reaction is act like that need to be cautious with. Especially running to your other friends to make you out to be the bad person. Don\u2019t be all too rainbows and sunshine yet.", "She specifically mentioned that had she known that you were each paying for your own food, she would have ordered differently.

Girl that is 6 course meal Michelin restaurant price! If you are fighting over a bill you should financially not be going to those places, period. I go out to fine dining with my partner often and gets apps, multiple drink, and entrees plus a hefty tip and NEVER has it EVER come close to $500! Even if it's an outrageously expensive restaurant and two people have THREE $20 drinks, a $30 app each, and say entrees are $50, and you tip 20% and meal tax, you still arent reaching even $400! This story doesn't add up. Please link where in the world you are ordering a la carte at those prices. A $500+ meal for two people should be impossible unless it is a tasting menu/ multi course prixe fix meal.", "Absolutely I'd love to see OP do some basic maths on how much she has subsidised her friend over the years.\n\nThe friend is getting off light if one meal is enough to make up for years of taking advantage of her generousity.", "I don\u2019t think the height was meant to indicate health or strength, only size, which usually also adds to a person\u2019s appetite.", "Glad it worked out.  \nMy first thought when I read your original post (just now) was - wait, SHE got a promotion, and she expects YOU to pay for dinner.   \nThat's just a weird vibe altogether.   \nGood to see she came to her senses.", "\ud83d\ude02", "That's great that you and your friend worked it out, and that she listened to you.

I can't imagine that because whenever I go out to eat with friends, each person's meal is $20 or less.  Where are you ladies eating?  Does she specifically invite you to expensive places so she can eat there while have a portion of her bill covered by you?", "I'm glad everything worked out.\n\n>I also want to address the male comments claiming that she's fat and we eat too much as women.\n\nUmmm, someone is AH, and it isn't you ladies....", "I am glad to hear you and your friend managed to work through your argument.

So Vanessa knowing took advantage of you for years, didn't believe you when you said you weren't paying, and then abandoned you at a restaurant when called out?

Can\u2019t believe it was so bad she even commented about it.

This was not a Michelin restaurant either and is always packed. \n\n\n\nSo these restaurants do exist", "[removed]", "Genuinely, where?! I have worked at places that sell wagyu, I have been in the fine dining industry for 10 years, both front of house and in chef positions, and even working on a private island that was #1 restaurant in the state, never have I seen $200 for one steak. The wagyu at CUT in las vegas which is claimed to be the most expensive steakhouse in the US is $120. So even if they ordered that, an app each, and drinks, I just cannot fathom a $500+ check for two people! Edit to add: the 6 course meal after tax at the #1 restaurant in america (EMP) is $285. So somehow they spent just slightly less than that?! It doesn't add up.", "Not sure if the OP mentioned if they were American or not but here in Canada this is the restaurant I went to. \n\nI was mistaken before though. It was actually kobe for the steak at $50+ per Oz.\n\nWhile this is in the pricier side for our city, there are other restaurants where the main dish is $100+ each. \n\n\nMy point is that a $500 bill for 2 is possible. \n\n\nhttps://blackandbluesteakhouse.ca/van-menu/", "I don\u2019t think your prices are right. As an example since you\u2019re asking for links to restaurants: here in the Bay Area, Alexander\u2019s is one of the most popular steakhouses. They\u2019re so popular that they have two locations here alone and are usually decently full. Their wagyus range from $145-$255 for 3 oz increments (the smallest portion they\u2019ll sell). Sides are not included with any of their steaks and most people will order at least a few of their appetizers (you can\u2019t go and not get their $42 hamachi shooter appetizers). The last time my boyfriend and I went there, we easily spent over $500 after drinks without even getting the wagyu. That\u2019s not even close to what some of the most expensive restaurants in the Bay cost.\n\nAlso Eleven Madison Park\u2019s 6 course tasting menu is $310/pp after taxes. Add in some drinks and a 20% tip and that\u2019s over $400/pp compared to OP\u2019s $285/pp.", "I hear you but even if they each got the most expensive entree on this menu and the most expensive app it would be $200 total, unless they ordered an insane amount off the per ounce steak menu, and they'd have to spend the same on food as drinks to get the bill over $500. If people are fighting over the bill they don't belong ordering in an establishment with absolutely outrageous prices. If two people are racking up a bill that high, that is near the price of two to dine a 6 course meal at the Eleven Madison Park lol, they are both TA in my opinion!", "\"Second, the $560 was because it was an expensive place, so if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant.\" had me in stitches. Well played", "NTA, but from woman to woman your comment \"if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant\" was in bad taste and sexist. Some people spend $500 on food for the month, you definitely have some privilege. If my partner offered an expensive place like that to gift me I would say \"he'll no, let's get <item> instead. I love food, but I've tried expensive food and it's not worth it for me.\n\nOnto the next part, as a woman I also gawked at the price. Unless their partner is a foodie like you, then why waste the money there when you can gift them something that they like more? I love my partner and if he loved food then that would be his gift, but if he wants a console then he'll yeah I'm going for that. I expect the same treatment. Not all of us woman expect diamonds and fancy restaurants. I make decent money, but I'd rather spend my money on the entertainment that my partner and I enjoy together. \n\nMoney spent doesn't equal love. You may push to get treated like a princess, but that just ends in quiet resentment and less interest in you. You are seen as another upkeep. Treat him as he treats you and it won't be a problem, if anything guys will be pretty impressed. I'm very independent, fix my own vehicle, pay my own shit ontop of other people's. It's been a charm for hooking up as half the women get them to pay for shit and then ask them for help to figure out any little problem. Be comfortable with yourself first, then look for a partner.
