{"id": 23857, "submission_id": "15hz8y4", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for refusing to split half of the check for dinner with my best friend like we usually do.", "selftext": "Firstly, thank you for all the advice and understanding from my first post, which can be found on my profile. \n\nBut to quickly recap, Vanessa, my best friend, and I have agreed to always split the check in half no matter how much we ordered. She recently got promoted and took us to a trending spot to which I've never gone to before. The check ended up being a total $560, out of which I had only ordered around $145. \nThis has always been the ratio in almost every dinner, brunch, or lunch because she not only has a bigger appetite, she will also sometimes order the more expensive items while I have a smaller appetite. BEFORE we ordered, I had told her that I will be paying for my own food only, to which she had said \"okay\". But after we had eaten and she saw that I actually was paying for my food only, she said she thought I was joking about paying for my own food only and said \"she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew I was being serious\". \nEnded up with her saying \"fine then, I'll pay for my own food\" and then she left without me. \nI felt like I was an asshole for doing that on her promotion day instead of having a conversation about it some time before, but honestly I never had a chance to bring it up and after my sister had mentioned that I shouldn't be paying half when our orders were so unbalanced I couldn't continue to do it anymore.\n\nAnyway, Vanessa has apologized for being mad and abandoning me at the restaurant because of the fight that we had, knowing that she had picked me up since my car was being fixed and I had to Uber home. \nI told her that since she had the promotion, she had to treat me to dinner and pay for the both of us like other friends do, to which she agreed and said that in order to make up for it she will take me out to dinner and pay for the entire meal. Which she did last night and she stayed true to her word and even told me that I can order whatever I want no matter the price. \nWe also had a long conversation about future dinners and stuff and we agreed to pay for our own food and get separate checks unless either one of us wants to pay for the entire dinner in the case of a promotion, celebration, or et cetera. \n\nI also want to address the male comments claiming that she's fat and we eat too much as women. First, we're both very fit and stromg. I'm 5'7 and she's 5'9. Second, the $560 was because it was an expensive place, so if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant. \n\nAnyway, the conclusion is, we resolved the problem and I greatly appreciate all the good advice and comments.", "created_utc": 1691153475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hz8y4/update_aita_for_refusing_to_split_half_of_the/", "score": 2117, "replies": ["Good to hear that she apologized to you.\n\nBut just keep in mind that she was deliberately taking advantage of you.

The wagyu at CUT in las vegas which is claimed to be the most expensive steakhouse in the US is $120. So even if they ordered that, an app each, and drinks, I just cannot fathom a $500+ check for two people! Edit to add: the 6 course meal after tax at the #1 restaurant in america (EMP) is $285.

Sides are not included with any of their steaks and most people will order at least a few of their appetizers (you can\u2019t go and not get their $42 hamachi shooter appetizers). The last time my boyfriend and I went there, we easily spent over $500 after drinks without even getting the wagyu. That\u2019s not even close to what some of the most expensive restaurants in the Bay cost.\n\nAlso Eleven Madison Park\u2019s 6 course tasting menu is $310/pp after taxes.

If people are fighting over the bill they don't belong ordering in an establishment with absolutely outrageous prices. If two people are racking up a bill that high, that is near the price of two to dine a 6 course meal at the Eleven Madison Park lol, they are both TA in my opinion!", "\"Second, the $560 was because it was an expensive place, so if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant.\" had me in stitches. Well played", "NTA, but from woman to woman your comment \"if you think we \"ate too much\", then you've never taken a girl out to a fine dining restaurant\" was in bad taste and sexist.

I love food, but I've tried expensive food and it's not worth it for me.\n\nOnto the next part, as a woman I also gawked at the price. Unless their partner is a foodie like you, then why waste the money there when you can gift them something that they like more? I love my partner and if he loved food then that would be his gift, but if he wants a console then he'll yeah I'm going for that. I expect the same treatment. Not all of us woman expect diamonds and fancy restaurants. I make decent money, but I'd rather spend my money on the entertainment that my partner and I enjoy together. \n\nMoney spent doesn't equal love. You may push to get treated like a princess, but that just ends in quiet resentment and less interest in you. You are seen as another upkeep. Treat him as he treats you and it won't be a problem, if anything guys will be pretty impressed. I'm very independent, fix my own vehicle, pay my own shit ontop of other people's. It's been a charm for hooking up as half the women get them to pay for shit and then ask them for help to figure out any little problem. Be comfortable with yourself first, then look for a partner.

Part of it is that the ingredients are of very high quality and might be less common (i.e., rare local organic microgreens versus a bag of shredded iceberg lettuce, expensive and time consuming food prep like molecular gastronomy techniques).  Part of it is that staff are probably going to be paid better due to their expertise (sommelier backgrounds and shit).  Part of it is that chefs of that caliber, like any expert in any arena, will charge more for their time.\n\nI've been to fine dining places a couple times and it really is a different experience than heading to the local restaurant.  They charge a ton accordingly.  It's not just the food, it's the whole experience. \n\nI personally wouldn't spend that much on a meal unless I won like $50,000 bucks or something, but some people are a lot richer than I am.  And some people are just dedicated foodies and save up money to go to those places as a rare treat, like how you'd save up for a vacation or a new gaming PC or whatever.", "Sounds like you where getting the short end of the stick the whole time. Glad you guys put the split bill no matter what crap behind you.", "One thing I\u2019m confused about, don\u2019t your friends usually treat YOU when you get promoted?", "Fine dining for two people is in the $350 range in Los Angeles. That's with me ordering at least five cocktails, too\n\nOP, where the fuck did your friend take you? That's like some Michelin bullshit", "My sister wanted to go to one of these swanky expensive places. She said she would pay for me and my wife.  My wife and I ended up splitting the cheapest meal we could find while my sister and her husband each ate a piece of meat which could flip the Flintstones car. \n\nAfterwords, my sister asked why we didn\u2019t enjoy it because the dinner was to honor me and my wife. \n\nI said, \u201cif you wanted to honor me, let\u2019s go to Sonny\u2019s and you can pay my car payment this month. And you would have saved money.\u201d", "It's nice to hear it all worked out. But was it really 560 american dollars?", "Same. I was the first one to clock her behavior and as a trauma response to it (coupled with years of subtle bullying and gaslighting), I ended up deleting most of our mutual friends because I was in full anxiety mode and unsure who was a true friend and who was \u201cpoisoned\u201d by her manipulation and backstabbing. Years later, all those mutual friends figured out she IS actually an asshole who takes advantage of people\u2019s kindness and money. \n\nStill haven\u2019t repaired those relationships that got caught in my explosive (over)reaction to years of passive aggressive bullying and emotional and financial manipulation, but I\u2019m still super glad I cut her out of my life, even if the blowback was immense."]}
