Ive seen reddit go full out you should go no contact. And theres also a lot of reddit saying to support your friend. This looks like it\u2019s going to be the defining moment of your adult friendship. Relationships are so complex i see both a reason to go being there to support you friend as, When the relationship fails you want to be her safe place to fall.

She's absolutely right that you're being unsupportive and judgmental, in that you don't support her choice of partner, are judging him for his poor character and, by extension, judging her for her willingness to overlook serious character flaws. IMO those are sound judgments on your part.\n\nJudging someone for making life choices or engaging in behaviors that you personally find not to your taste, but which objectively don't hurt anybody, is wrong. By contrast, judging somebody for being a misogynist, a bigot, and an overall tool is, arguably, a moral imperative. You're doing the right thing by calling out shitty behavior and refusing to accept your friend's regrettable handwaving of said behavior.\n\nSorry that you might end up losing a friend over this.

Now they\u2019re on the mend - but I wanted to be there for my sib regardless of how it played out. \n\nPlease please be there for Sarah, if you can. However you can.

So those few off putting comments that John makes now could become a flood of racist or misogynistic comments that are worse.  \n\nWith deciding not to attend the wedding (which IMO was the right choice) however John has indicated he felt about you will likely be expressed in a not lovely way that may surprise Sarah. \n\nYou can send a gift if you like though I sadly doubt it will change anything. \n\nGoing forward you might text Sarah on her birthday or anniversary of something you did together.

He seems the type to use you not going to the wedding as a means to break a friendship. Sarah is blind to his faults and she will need someone there for her if and when the marriage goes south.\n\nGoing would be supporting your friend. Not him. Not the marriage, but her. You can show her that you will be there for her. And show John that he cannot drive you away.\n\nSo if and when she leaves, she knows that you are there to help because he hasn't poisoned her against you.", "Sarah is in for a rude awakening - all the problematic behaviors of anyone will only get more exaggerated at marriage and people actually change.

Stand up for your beliefs. Honestly, if he\u2019s a misogynistic racist, they\u2019re not going to have a long lasting marriage. Either that, or your friend is a racist and you never realized it.

She believes that she can change him or that his negative traits don't outweigh the positive aspects of their relationship\n\nI hate this. Accepting people as they are does not include accepting blatantly toxic people into your life. \"I can fix him/her\" is also a really bad mindset to have.

However, we decided against it as we knew it wouldn't go well so we figured we will support her and allow her to make her own mistakes. \n\nThe difference with our friend though was that her relationship issues were more about the guy being a leech, the wedding happening suddenly, other things that didn't make sense and not so much that he was outwardly an asshole. So it was easier to step aside and allow her to make her own mistakes, which she swiftly learned and have since gotten divorced. \n\nIn your friend's case, the big difference is that her partner is loudly, proudly and publicly spouting misogynistic, racist, sexist behaviors and your friend's response is you should just accept him and she herself  doesn't seem to find it objectionable.

It would be the same for me if my bestfriend became super close friends with someone else who was also this way and was happy as a clam to be their friend and wanted them to hang out with us, I would begin to question her sanity and also if we shared the same values at all.", "You did the hardest but best thing, I have been there from both sides.

Trust me, even if you went through with the wedding, it does not guarantee it would save your friendship.\n\nI say that because I went through a similar heartbreak with my maid of honor, who was my longtime best friend. We got married about 8 months apart, and we were each other's MOH. I went through with being in the wedding, even though I had major reservations. I saw not only problematic behavior from her fiance, but problematic behavior beginning & increasing in her the longer she was with him. But I was caught up in the joys of each of our upcoming marriages and didn't want to admit it to myself how bad it was.\n\nI noticed similar issues -- discriminatory \"jokes,\" rudeness to service staff, misogynistic comments, rude comments about my own wedding compared to theirs, rude comments toward my husband. (My least favorite was probably the >!rape !<\"*joke*\" he and his friends made the night of the rehearsal dinner. My husband sat with the guys and told me about it because he was appalled.) I excused a lot until the days leading up to the wedding when I couldn't take it anymore, but it was too late. So I went through with the ceremony and went home in tears. We literally never spoke again after her wedding. There had been some awkward moments revealing our differences, and I think it was an unspoken understanding that I no longer supported her husband, their marriage or the person she had become around him. I needed some space and fully intended to reach out to her eventually, but as time passed, I kept putting it off, she never reached out and we just never spoke again.\n\nSo, the moral of that story is... I truly believe you should follow your morals. If your instincts and your values tell you this guy is bad news, pretending you support him/the relationship out of loyalty to her won't likely be worth it in the end. It's hard to keep up that kind of facade and, sadly, this is the person she has chosen. I hope your outcome is better than mine. I hope you can maintain your friendship, or that your friend realizes what kind of person she's marrying. But I truly recommend following your heart and your morals.

I appreciate that she never stopped being a supportive friend. All three ladies that stood with me are still my close friends and they stood at my wedding AND where there for me through the abuse and the divorce. I love them and I appreciate them.", "YTA - From your description, it sounds like John fits the profile of a possible abuser. You're doing his work for him by isolating your friend from support networks. Declining to be Maid of Honour for this mess makes sense, but not going to the wedding at all is not how to play it. \n\nSuck it up - go to the wedding with the framing \"I'm supporting you, I love you and I always will be here for you - any day, including your wedding day\" and ignore John as much as possible on the day. \n\nIn general, when he does shitty stuff in front of you, or she tells you about shitty stuff that he says or does, confirm for her that it is in fact shitty, as he attempts to warp her perception of reality. \n\nWith any luck, your friendship will outlive their marriage.

Younger generations (I'm gen x, so younger to me) seem to experience enormous pressure to shun people whose politics or behavior or whatever they do not agree with. You can't be seen consuming problematic pop culture like Harry Potter or else you are anti-trans, you can't attend a Louis CK show or you are sanctioning a sex offender, someone sang along to rap lyrics as a teen on video so anyone who is friends with them a decade later is a white supremacist. \n\nY'all have it hard. I frankly do not know what to make of all the intolerance and judgment these days, it's so normal for younger people, it's gross to those of us raised to be less judgmental, but it isn't your fault society went that way. I don't think it's healthy for anyone to try to maintain relationships with such severe restrictions in place, and it sucks that you have to navigate it.\n\nBut let's be clear here: this is a step that will permanently damage your friendship, if not end it. I assume that is obvious to you. Best friends do not come along easily as you get older. You profess to being concerned about your principles, but if you want this friendship to continue, suck it up, this is only a problem inside your head. You are making this wedding about you, and you need to stop centering yourself here, and be a supportive friend. Certainly nobody believes the MOH participates in a wedding bc of how much she agrees with what the groom has to say about the world or the people in it - nobody will associate you with anything he says, they will know you are there because you are a person who stands up for her friends even when they are making mistakes, because that is PRECISELY when we need our friends the most. \n\nRemember, friends show up for friends, they stand with friends, even when they disagree with some of their decisions. This is arguably the most essential quality of friendship. If they don't show up, they lose those friends, esp in this sort of situation, bc friends do not stay close to people who punish them bc they fall in love with someone the friend doesn't like (or even finds loathesome).\n\nYou need to decide whether or not you are a good enough friend to stop making your best friend's wedding all about you, and this \"problem\" you have decided to indulge at your bff's expense.

Her current boyfriend has an almost 10 year age gap forward from her, no license, no car, 2 kids that aren't hers, and routinely bring drugs into her home.

When she eventually pulls her head out of her ass she's going to need a soft place to land and I always let her know in my messages that she can come to me for anything (while not mentioning the blatant abuse and using). Someday, she's going to need to get out, and while I won't be party to that relationship they have together, she still knows I'm a soft place to land if she ever chooses herself. Sometimes, that's the most you can do. \n\nHer dad and I have had several conversations about this because he's my 2nd papa bear, and I love him and her mother to absolute pieces.

I try to let her know I understand, and he does as well... but if we (Papa bear and I) could telaport this dude to another planet with her not knowing using our powers combined, I'm fairly sure we would also telaport a bomb there.\n\nKeep the lifeline alive because one day, she might really, truly need someone. It sucks to lose your best friend for days or months or even close to a decade... but if you love her keep her close in your heart and make sure she knows she can land softly with you... if she's truly your best friend, you can do that for her. Have the hard talks and tell her you want to meet for coffee or at her place (like if he doesn't like her going out, which I've recently adapted to). Fine, he doesn't want her going out, he can't say shit if I'm in the home she pays for before he gets there.\n\nBe the strong silent wall that is reinforcing your friend unless it limits your own mental strength.
