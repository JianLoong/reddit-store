But I guess you have to decide if your friendship is worth sacrificing for your principles. At this point you have made it clear how you feel. Not attending won\u2019t change her mind about him but it might about you. Is this the hill you\u2019re willing to die on?", "Hot take but NAH. This sounds like a friendship-ending situation, but friendships end in the real world all the time. If you have an honest-to-god objection to this marriage, then so be it. But you also lose the right to claim Sarah as a friend, and she has every right to cut you off.", "NTA. Unfortunately not being the asshole doesn't mean you'll get to keep your friend. I wouldn't be surprised if she cuts off the friendship if you don't go to the wedding", "NTA but your actions will have consequences. you can only do what\u2019s right for you, but don\u2019t necessarily expect her to be here on the sunny side of it.", "At what point do we end friendships because we are who we surround ourselves with. Ive seen reddit go full out you should go no contact. And theres also a lot of reddit saying to support your friend. This looks like it\u2019s going to be the defining moment of your adult friendship. Relationships are so complex i see both a reason to go being there to support you friend as, When the relationship fails you want to be her safe place to fall. But on the flip side you hang out in public with a racist your racist by extension.  Right now this is a NAH right now well except for toxic man. Look at what you can be comfortable with but know this conversation may end the friendship.", "NTA. She's absolutely right that you're being unsupportive and judgmental, in that you don't support her choice of partner, are judging him for his poor character and, by extension, judging her for her willingness to overlook serious character flaws. IMO those are sound judgments on your part.\n\nJudging someone for making life choices or engaging in behaviors that you personally find not to your taste, but which objectively don't hurt anybody, is wrong. By contrast, judging somebody for being a misogynist, a bigot, and an overall tool is, arguably, a moral imperative. You're doing the right thing by calling out shitty behavior and refusing to accept your friend's regrettable handwaving of said behavior.\n\nSorry that you might end up losing a friend over this. With any luck, eventually she might come around, dump his ass, and apologize to you.", "NAH - I don't think I can call you an asshole for not supporting your friend's marriage to someone that you understandably don't like, but your friend isn't wrong to feel unsupported here and you're asking because you know the blowback will be rough.\n\nThe real question is how willing are you to tolerate your friend's asshole husband?", "NTA but also not being the friend she needs. Say your peace and then move on in whatever way she asks you to support her. Set boundaries that reinforce your unwavering support of her, if that means no double dates, avoiding discussing him, whatever you can live with. She will know what you think of him (and won\u2019t need reminders so don\u2019t) and when/if she sees it too she\u2019ll know she can rely on you to help her move on.", "NTA.

I guarantee you that man does not give a single fuck whether you're the MOH or not.  The only person who suffers here is someone you call a friend.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nThis was tough, and John sounds like an ass, but ultimately, Sarah is the only person hurt by you refusing to be her maid of honour. I guarantee John doesn\u2019t give one, so you not showing up isn\u2019t \u201cstanding against John\u2019s toxic behaviour\u201d\n\nWhilst I do understand your reasoning, I don\u2019t think Sarah is entirely off target when she said you were unsupportive. Ultimately you have to decide which is more important to you; your love for your friend or your hatred for John", "Hey OP\n\nYou\u2019re NTA - but let\u2019s also highlight someone else here who isn\u2019t an AH - Sarah\n\nPlease hear me out. You care about her. That much is obvious from your very short post. She\u2019s caught up with this guy. I suspect there\u2019s probably already abuse of some sort happening, but she won\u2019t fully admit it \n\nGuys like him count on friends like you walking away. Please don\u2019t let him win. \n\nI understand your emotions, and your feelings. I\u2019d be pissed too. But - even if she doesn\u2019t see it yet - Sarah needs you. Please read the bestofRedditorpdates sub sometime, to see exactly how many are either Sarah or the you - and both sides glad they didn\u2019t let the other go\n\nWhen hell breaks loose - as you can see coming a mile away, it will - Sarah will need you. Please ask yourself if you\u2019re willing to deal with your own emotions and frustrations to be there for her. If yes - then there could be a way to attend the wedding, decline being an MOH but still support your friend. Without pushing, making sure she knows you\u2019re her judgement-free port in a storm. \n\nI have a sibling I had to grit and do this for, with their partner for years. Now they\u2019re on the mend - but I wanted to be there for my sib regardless of how it played out. \n\nPlease please be there for Sarah, if you can. However you can.

It would not be endorsing him or the relationship to be there for her, it would be supporting your friend. If he is as bad as you believe, chances are time will prove you're right and your friend is going to need you. If you are wrong, then you lost a friendship over nothing. What's more important? Your friendship with Sarah, or taking a stand against a man who Sarah is going to marry regardless of your opinion; and who likely doesn't care if you are there or not.", "Soft YTA, sometimes it's better to be kind than right.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you're TA if you don't go.  But you may want to think about the best way to support Sarah.  If her chosen partner is as bad as you describe, one day she's going to see that (since marriage usually magnifies these issues rather than cures them).  If I were in your shoes and Sarah's friendship meant a lot to me, I'd go.  Not in support of the marriage but to show Sarah, it doesn't matter, you're still there.  So when she needs to get out.

And that\u2019s a toxic human to be around. My best friend could call me at any time but when she got with someone who believes in physical fighting between adults and drinking to black out.

As much as it sucks, you may do more good by showing her that you are always there for her. I do a lot of work with abuse survivors and isolation is a common factor holding people back from getting away.", "Wtf NTA not sure you should be sad about ending the friendship either", "NTA, the only thing you've done wrong is cling to a friendship just because of how long it has existed. Look into the sunk cost fallacy and then think about why you're so concerned about losing someone willing to marry a racist. Chances are she agrees with him. Even the best case scenario is that your best friend is not willing to stand up for you, which I think makes her a pretty awful best friend.", "you need to separate the Y T A like this otherwise the bot will count that as judgment", "There are many instances, but I decided to not attend their wedding or have anything to do with him when he made a racist comment at a dinner party I went to. He was going off about how black people \u201cpiss him off \u201c because of their victim mentality and that systematic racism was made up by POC to justify being lazy and having someone else to blame.

Although I love her, I find it quite difficult to support this.
