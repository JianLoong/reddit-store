They also have a son, Adam, who is 5.\n\nA couple of weeks ago my parents, Jason, and the kids all came to visit me.

She said I should have known how hurtful this would be to her since she has always tried so hard to be a mother to Lucy and she feels like she\u2019s been looked over. She said it was my fault for letting Lucy use me for the project rather than steering her to ask Maggie.

Jason obviously knew the deal. Shouldn't Jason be the one who should've known that his WIFE would be upset?\n\nHow lovely for Lucy that she has women in her life that inspire her. Maybe it's simply that her natural interests are more in line with yours than Maggies? It doesn't mean she doesn't love Maggie.\nIn any case, this is Maggies insecurity, no amount of steering from you or love from Lucy can change that; Maggie needs to learn to deal with her feelings herself rather than trying to make others responsible for them.", "NTA  You should feel honored, your niece obviously loves you and finds you interesting. \n\nMaggie is having a lot of feelings about this and none of them are wrong, but her reaction is. She has a right to have hurt feelings. It's better than you telling Lucy no and her having hurt feelings though, right? Did you ask Lucy when she mentioned most people were doing on their mothers how she ended up choosing  you?", "NTA - Maggie is showing exactly why Lucy didn't choose her as an inspiring woman. She is jealous for not being chosen, instead of encouraging of her daughter's work. At no point did Lucy get told \"this is about mothers\"; it's just an implication because a kid is more likely to be the most comfortable to do this work with their mom than anyone else. \n\nLucy is comfortable with you, and that should be a great achievement for a step child to feel fully integrated into a family.", "NTA all that Lucy told you was that the project was about interviewing a woman she found inspiring. It was neither yours nor Lucy's fault that her mother reacted like a petulant child. She should introspect about why she wasn't asked rather than take it out on you.", "INFO: Do you know why your niece was making the project about you and not her birth mother or Maggie? Is it because you do something especially interesting or inspiring or is it because there is friction at home? Were you surprised that Maggie was upset or was that something you were expecting?", "NTA, I can see how Maggie could be disappointed; but her reaction is over the top. Maggie SHOULD be happy that Lucy has trusted adults in her life that are inspiring Lucy and helping her grow into a good human. Maggie needs to stop acting like a spoiled child and gain some perspective.", "NTA - Lucy's project, Lucy's choice.  The fact that you had friends that were willing to help show her how to edit the video's was a plus for Lucy, but had nothing to with her choosing you for her project.", "NTA - Lucy asked you and not Maggie. There is probably a reason for that. You are a inspiration for Lucy. Why should Lucy lie in her project? \n\nYour sister is jealous of your relationship with Lucy. I do understand that but there is no reason why she should lash off at you. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. You have a nice relationship with your step-niece and that\u2018s beautiful. Don\u2018t feel bad because your sister is jealous.", "NTA\n\nYou were asked. It would be rude to refuse. At 10 years old Lucy is starting to realise the world is bigger than her immediate family and that's just her developing as a person.\n\nI'm sure there will be more opportunities for this mother step daughter bond to flourish but forcing it will not help.", "NTA, your sister is just jealous", "NAH - I think you did the right thing. You agreed to help your niece with her project. I also don't think Maggie did anything wrong. She's just feeling hurt and expressed her emotions to you.", "NTA. Your sister is hurt and is lashing out at you because she can't realistically take this out on Lucy. It's understandable why she's upset about the bigger issue of feeling overlooked, but being upset with you about the project in particular is petty, especially because you didn't know it was supposed to be about mothers (if that's even true) and because Lucy approached you about it (it's not like you asked to be featured in her video). There are bigger issues in your sisters family that she needs to work through with them, and she is the AH for dragging you into them.", "NTA. Don't be crazy hard on your sister. She is projecting all of her emotions at you because it's her safest option. Your sister needs a hug and a good cry. \n\nBTW, no, you shouldn't have encouraged Lucy to do the project on your sister. And this has literally nothing to do with her relationship with her stepdaughter. Lucy was thinking about her assignment and it struck her. If anything, this shows she IS a good *mother. Lucy felt confident to see and admire women outside of her closest group. I think all of you are lucky to have each other.

Too bad.", "NTA. Your sister is jealous because her daughter chose you and not her. The problem is all hers not yours.", "YTA. I mean... what did you THINK Maggie would say? Both you and Jason figured she'd be pumped that (according to Lucy herself) this project was meant to be a love letter to the kids' moms, and she was jettisoned for the aunt?\n\nReally? How thoughtless ARE you guys?", "NTA. I get your sister being hurt. She\u2019s only human.  But she needs to deal with whatever is going on with her husband.", "NTA. Was Lucy supposed to fail since she wasn\u2019t even around during the time she worked on the project? I say that confidently because she only approached you when it was completed.", "Read last line again louder for OP", "NTA I just want to say that as a parent, if either of my kids had a project like this, I would really hope that they would choose someone other than me. It's okay to be inspired by your parents. It's okay to love your parents, but sometimes doing the project only on your parents is simply the easy way out. If this had happened with my oldest, I would have been honored if he had chosen my sister over me. Obviously I have no clue what sort of relationship your niece has with your sister. I feel that part of being a good parent is letting your kids spread their wings, let them fly and being that safe space that they need.", "NTA. Maggie clearly isn't inspirational. Not your fault.", "NTA.  How were you supposed to know the project was about mothers.  That was never specifically said to you, AND Lucy's dad was involved in the project, if it was such a big deal, why didn't he say something?  This is not on you.  You had no idea that this was going to happen.  Your niece asked for help with a project & you obliged.  You haven't done anything wrong.  Maggie is TA.", "NTA, but you should've seen this coming.", "I really don't think it is Jason's job.  Maggie is a grownup, not a child, and should be managing herself and behaving without the need for her husband's guidance and coddling.", ">Both you and Jason figured she'd be pumped that (according to Lucy herself) this project was meant to be a love letter to the kids' moms\n\nI'm not sure what you're talking about. Maggie is the only one insisting this project is supposed to be about moms; Jason and OP made no mention of Maggie's feelings about the project, and all Lucy said about the project regarding moms was that everyone else in her class chose their moms as the subjuct. \n\nJust bc the rest of the class is doing the project on their moms doesn't mean Lucy has to do the same. When the guideline just stipulates that it has to be about women that inspire them, then that means it's open to *all* women. Most 10 year olds just aren't going to be inspired by many women other than their moms-they may not be close to other female relatives and a lot of children that age wouldn't be interested in picking a historical figure they don't personally know. \n\nIt sounds like Maggie's projecting her insecurities onto the project, bc it's clearly *not* meant only for mothers or mother-figures. Maggie's argument about them being subtle about it being for moms discounts the possibility of a kid with a single dad, or 2 dads, or whatever other option results in kids not having a mom.", "NTA and it's real rich for Maggie to be mad at you instead of her husband, who obviously facilitated this whole thing.", "I'm gonna say soft NTA, because the project was not specifically for mums it's for inspiring women. However when she said everyone else was doing their mum, I would have asked if she'd spoken to her stepmum/considered her at all as I can see how that could be hurtful.", " Tell Maggie  you will stop being inspiring, just for her. Is there a rule about there being only one inspiring woman per family?", "NTA you were just trying to help and as Jason was part of this your sister should be talking to him over this.", "NTA, she wanted to do it on you. Its not like you forced Lucy to do anything.", "Ew. YTA.", "NTA and that was my take. jason-the dad-was a part of the shadowing,  that seems to give it the stamp of parental approval.", "I agree with you NTA you couldn't said it better than you did. Also, does Jason coddle Maggie all the time", "Might just be me, but I personally don't find a grown woman who throws hissy fits and trashes on her own relatives to be particularly inspiring.", "I doubt it was about mothers, as the school could have said a family member who inspires you.  They want kids to pick someone who is in their circle, who inspires them.  That can be a relative, a friend's family member, a neighbor.  The sister is over-reacting by thinking she must be the only female inspiration of her step daughter.", ">She said the project was meant to be about mothers, and while the school can\u2019t really say that because some kids are raised by other relatives, that\u2019s what is meant.\n\nThis also feels like faulty reasoning. The assignment was for the students go go out and interview a woman who inspired them. It had no limitation that the woman in question had to be family at all ... but doesn't Lucy considering OP as her aunt inherently validate that she sees Maggie as a mother? \n\nAlso, \\*of course\\* a 10yo is going to hop on the chance to interview her \"cool\" aunt from out of town to impress her friends. Following around someone who you love but don't see that often is going to be way more fun and interesting than following around your mom who you see every day.", "I\u2019m only 11 years older than my niece and she thought I was the coolest because I had my own mini fridge full of Diet Coke in my room during high school.

I\u2019d just grey rock her, she\u2019ll get over it", "NTA Her mom doesn't inspire her because she's often absent for work", "NTA. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. I get why she\u2019s hurt about it but it doesn\u2019t mean she can lash out at you like this. Besides, her dad was there the whole time so he could have said something too", "NTA. You sound like a great aunt. Maggie is being childish.", "Nta. Lucy is 10, an age where she is more likely to start viewing her parents as embarrassing, rather than inspiring. Maggie seems like she is wanting to keep the same dynamic with Lucy that she had with her when she was younger, but she needs to realize that the dynamic is going to change as Lucy grows up.", "Exactly this!\n\nNTA, OP. You went above and beyond and Lucy learned a lot from this assignment. Sorry it turned sideways on you.", ">Maybe it's simply that her natural interests are more in line with yours than Maggies\n\nThis. I love my mom more than anything, but when I was 10, I would have picked my aunt (her little sister) over her for a project like this.

My aunt is only 15 years older and listened to rock music, drove a convertible and was studying photojournalism.\n\nAs an adult, I feel like a total asshole typing that out even though my mom will never see it.", "It may be helpful to point out to your sister that everyone else doing theirs about their moms could be very painful for Lucy and that she could feel like she's betraying her mom in some way if she did it on Maggie. So it's a less emotional situation if she does it about you. Your sister shouldn't take it as a slight, even if it hurts a bit, but understand that it's not Lucy rejecting her as a stepmom, it's a child trying to navigate difficult emotions and finding the safest way to do so.\n\nAnd she should recognize that using you really means that Lucy sees Maggie's family as her own too.\n\nEdit:word", "NTA for doing the project but you could have handled your sister\u2019s disappointment better. \n\nYou say your niece interviewed you because she thinks your pretty, grandparents say you\u2019re smart, and her dad says your special. \n\nEven if it\u2019s just jealousy you haven\u2019t said anything to indicate she\u2019s a bad parent and it\u2019s natural to be disappointed when a child you raise says she looks up to the fun aunt instead of the woman who is raising her. \n\nInstead of being supportive you come off as gloating. I hope your sister never sees this post or she\u2019ll be even angrier than she is now and you might not see your niece as often unless her father tries to leave for the special person.", "NTA", "> Maybe it's simply that her natural interests are more in line with yours than Maggies\n\n> This.

Our regular fridge sucks and drinks are my storage issue", "I need one too for the same reason!", "NTA", "NTA, I can understand how your sister might feel a little stung if she\u2019s the only mother who wasn\u2019t covered in the class but that\u2019s frankly very unlikely. It\u2019s really great that your niece sees you as family and is comfortable with you. Ultimately her happiness is what matters most here. Sometimes parents put more significance on these events or their child\u2019s choices than is really warranted.\n\nI really love my mum and even as a little kid we had a lot of interests in common and I looked up to her. I wasn\u2019t very interested in fashion and hated changing my clothes but I remember being extremely proud of this one shirt I had that was very similar to one of her office shirts. I would insist on packing it to wear to formal events after school. But when I had a similar assignment I picked my grandmother. Not because I preferred her, not because my mum was too busy, I just thought it would be interesting. And my mum thought it was a lovely idea. \n\nIt sounds like your sister works a lot and maybe worries about how this affects her relationship with her kids. But kids are smarter than we think and can often tell when their parents are trying their best.

You did nothing wrong, and your sister is taking her disappointment out on you.", "It\u2019s not about moms, though. Lucy says other people are focusing on moms, not that that\u2019s what the point is.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d expect another adult to be jealous of something like this, rather than happy that their kid has people in their life they look up to."]}
