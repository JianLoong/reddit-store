I wanted the occasion to be memorable for Zoe, so I went all out with decorations, a bounce house, and a huge cake. However, I made the decision to not invite my husband, Marc (34M), to the party.\n\nNow for the context, Marc and I have been having some issues in our marriage lately. It's not going very well for him at work and it rubs off on us, he's always grumpy and seems to have little interest in spending time with me and my daugther when he comes back home. I've been juggling my part-time job, taking care of Zoe, and managing the household all by myself while he does little to nothing to help me. I've been feeling overwhelmed and underappreciated lately and I've talked to my husband about this, but he hasn't shown much understanding or support about the situation. We also had a lot of arguments and I know it upsets my daugther to see us like this, but she's still fond of her father.\n\nSo, when it came time to plan Zoe's birthday party, I decided to exclude Marc from the guest list. I just invited my parents, my sister, and a few friends. I wanted me and Zoe to have a happy and stress-free birthday celebration without any tension or drama that could arise if Marc was here. The party was a huge success and Zoe had a blast.\n\nBut Marc found out about it later and he was furious at me and yelled how I was horrible that I didn't even tell him about the birthday party of his own daugther. He accused me of deliberately excluding him and making him feel like a bad father. He said he couldnt believe I would do something like that to him. I told him that I did what I thought was best for me and Zoe and that it wasn't a big deal anyway, that we could arrange something later together but he didn't want to hear anything more and stormed off.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT : To be more specific, my husband knew that I was having a birthday party, I just didn't tell him when, I didn't go into details and I didn't invite the in-laws either. We just had the birthday party on our side me and my daughter. I thought that doing something just the three of us later would be a good compromise and my daughter could spend some time with her father but maybe I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1677767670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g499d/aita_for_not_inviting_my_husband_to_our_daugthers/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or at least notified that one was happening!!!\n\nYou're using Zoe to punish Marc and make him look bad. That's toxic and abusive, well beyond AH territory. If you at any point told Zoe that her father couldn't make it, or didn't want to be there, or in any way implied that his absence was not 100% your choice, that's parental alienation. If you're in the US, and Marc can prove this, that can be used to limit the amount of time you have custody of Zoe.\n\nStop wasting Marc's time and get a divorce. You aren't treating him like a husband, or a partner, or even someone you have any affection for at all. If you just need his money to provide for Zoe, that can be done via a child support payment without all the drama.", "YTA. You keep saying what\u2019s best for YOU and Zoey. Zoey is your child.

She should be the centre of attention, not you. Your daughter is a human child, not a stick to beat your husband with when he's  down. Do better", "YTA but how tf did he not know the birthday party was happening and did he not plan to do anything with his daughter for her birthday??? I love how everyone is overlooking how OP put so much love and time into planning a birthday party for her daughter and he hadn't talked to her at all about planning anything whatsoever. OP, were you being sneaky with the planning or is he just that checked out?\n\nAnyway, you should probably look into marriage counseling or divorce. I don't know the extent of how bad it is in the house, if you think he's just burnt out from work or if this is him giving up on working with you, but this isn't the way to go about it.", "YTA. It\u2019s his daughter and y\u2019all are married. Get divorced if this is the kind of situation you want.", "YTA. I can see why your marriage is on the rocks.", "YTA the problems between you and your husband are just that between you and your husband! That being said, don\u2019t be a trash, panda mother and put your child in between  y\u2019all\u2019s problems. Do better as a mother. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "YTA\u2026 by the way, did you pay for this party from your part time funds or from money his work provides for you??? Lord, I hope he divorces you and uses this party as a reason to get full custody.", "\u201cHe accused me of deliberately excluding him\u201d\u2026 well you did so lol \nYTA. I absolutely cannot imagine not inviting my husband to our child\u2019s party? It\u2019s not even like you are separated? How even?", "YTA obviously. There is absolutely no way in any world that you won't be a gigantic steaming pile of crap.\n\nWith the attitude you just displayed here it's no wonder he doesn't want to spend any time with you. \n\nShe's \"still fond of her father\" are you kidding me?? Just because yall are fighting doesn't mean he's fighting with his child. You want her to hate him and be mad at him because you are. You weaponized and used your child to deliberately hurt him. You're an extra asshole for that \n\nSeems to me you want things your way or no way. Continue down this road and eventually it will be you who's getting left out because  ZOE the person whose needs you don't put first will not want you around", "YTA. I got to the second paragraph and the first thought that came to my mind is that your husband is depressed and needs the loving support of his wife. Also, the fact that you refer to your daughter as \u201cmy daughter\u201d instead of \u201cour daughterI\u201d is pretty telling. I\u2019m not even going to address your toxic behavior regarding the party.", "yta wow you are extremely selfish. its about your daughter not you. no wonder you are having trouble in your marriage try being supportive of your childs relationship with her father or else she eventually going to see how selfish you are and resent you.", "ESH. You had to know how this was going to go.  At the same time, didn\u2019t he think it was weird that there were apparently no plans to celebrate her birthday?", "YTA, you're basically telling your daughter that her father is not an important figure in her life. This was for your benefit, not your daughter's benefit. If you want him to step up more you have to work through that, not eliminate him from your daughter's life.", "YTA. \n\nIf you were looking for a way to break your relationship down further,  congratulations, you found it.", "YTA. You NEVER bring children into marital disputes. You suck it up, put on a happy face and invite her damn FATHER.", "Nta. He forgot his own child birthday. He doesn\u2019t spend time with his child when he\u2019s home & he would go out with his friends while ignoring his child", "YTA. You didn't actually make this decision for your daughter. You made it for you. \n\nYou stated your husband is struggling at work, but you didn't specify how. Is he having to put in extra hours to make ends meet? Is he at risk of losing his job? \n\nYou gloss over what he's going through to highlight what you're going through.  Is it possible that the reason he hasn't been understanding of what you're going through because you haven't been understanding of what he's going through? \n\nYou left out his side to this, which either means you don't know it, you don't care, or you know it makes you look bad. \n\nEnd of the day, it sounds like you guys should get divorced", "YTA. It sounds like Zoe would rather have her father at her birthday. It\u2019s on you to behave and not fight with him at the party so that she doesn\u2019t get stressed out. Not inviting him was selfish.", "YTA woooooow. Are you sure none of the issues are stemming from how you treat the relationship?", "ESH. You are going to have to coparent with him whether you stay together or divorced.  This just leads to petty back and forth.  You could have had a conversation where you told him you wanted to do separate parties because your kid just knows her dad don\u2019t come to the party.\n\nHe\u2019s an AH for having no part of planning his child\u2019s party.  It\u2019s obvious that his expectation was for you to do all the work and he just shows up.  I can\u2019t grasp that before he found out, he just thought you weren\u2019t doing anything and didn\u2019t step up to even get his kid a birthday present.", "My ex is a complete whopper, but is still invited to our children\u2019s birthday parties. \nYTA", "Wow. Just wow.\n\nYTA. But you knew this already.", "NTA Sounds like you were doing your best to think about your daughter and keep any stress out of her day.\n\nWas it the right decision?  I don't know but I'm sure it was a tricky one to make.  I suspect you made the right call, for your daughters sake, if only because the grumpy man wasn't at her birthday party.", "I am going to say NTA.  There is one reason for this.  He doesn't have interest in spending time with your daughter on normal days.  You don't get to pass on the day to day, then get invited to the special occasions.  He should be stepping up every single day if he wants a relationship with his kid.", "I agree  with this", "Second this!", "OP , so much YTA you call him your husband not your kids father.", "Right!  I wondered about that too.", "It's cause this is probably all fake and just a karma farm. Just someone who doesn't get attention in real life, so they are trying to get some kind of attention online even if it's bad.", "You didn't read very well.  She didn't exclude him because they are not on good terms.  She excluded him because he doesn't want to spend time with his daughter.  He comes home and wants no part of her.  Why would he get an invite to a special event when he makes the CHOICE to not be there and spend time with his kid when he gets home from work?  Why would she do even MORE work, and put up with even MORE stress, when daily he is showing that she and their daughter are not priorities in his life?  Also, who would want him there if he is going to fight or be more of a burden to the parent who IS there every day?", "Many people are accusing the OP of using her daughter to hurt her husband because of their crumbling marriage, but she was in fact keeping her daughter out of their marital problems.  She was protecting her daughter from what would almost certainly have been a tense and volatile situation on her birthday.  \n\nPerhaps she should have told the husband the day, but he may have made a point of showing up for the wrong reasons, seeing as he doesn\u2019t seem to care about his daughter otherwise.\n\nFor the husband not to realise any of this, to make it all about himself and to react aggressively, tells us a lot about him.", "Unfortunately petty drama will likely continue. Coparenting will be a disaster with this lady.", "You can order and plan all that stuff online to be picked up or delivered on the day of the party. So unless she shared details, I could understand why he might not know.", "I was wondering this too. Did husband never ask when/where the party is? Is this one of those things that he just expects her to do. I would say it would completely absolve the OP but it would definitely make me understand why the OP would think it\u2019s reasonable. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with a husband who was miserable because of work and took it out on everyone else. I can see how repeated hurt can lead to this.", "I agree. Did he ask or ever bring up a birthday party before he found out about it? I agree with everyone that excluding him is pretty far into Y T A. However, didn't he ask or wonder how they were going to celebrate?", "Because he is so busy with his work that he didn't realize it. He's hardly ever at home, he goes out a lot with his friends and we've hardly spoken lately.", "Yeah, I can't imagine anyone being dense enough to not realize that a father excluded from his daughter's birthday party is going to be mad about it.", "She's supporting him by taking care of everything else in the house tbh. Him not wanting to spend time with daughter when he comes home means mom gets no individual time on top of everything else she's doing. Didn't even seem like he was concerned with putting something together for his daughter's birthday, just thought he'd coast and enjoy her hard work ig? \n\nShe's definitely in the wrong here but as a parent, you don't get to just retreat from everything and then neglect your partner's concerns. You have to communicate and show appreciation when your partner steps up where you're falling back.", "Everyone does not suck here. Read her wording. She is actively working to alienate this poor little girl from her father that OP admits her daughter \u201cis fond of\u201d. That is evil behavior and the father is absolutely correct to be livid with the predatory mother.", "I agree. Unless she blatantly lied to him, I don\u2019t see how he couldn\u2019t have bothered to ask about plans?", "Right.  I do think it\u2019s an AH move to the daughter, but no one is picking up on the fact that since he thought there wasn\u2019t a party, he didn\u2019t do anything to make sure his kid had a good birthday.  He was ok with it not getting celebrated and only got mad when he found out it was.", "The way OP worded it, their problems only started to occur once her husband started having difficulty at work. Rather than trying to support him and help him get through this rough patch, she has instead decided to make his life even more difficult by saying he's not supporting her enough. Support is a two-way street, but OP's words come off as though she is the only one entitled to it.\n\nI'm not saying the husband is absolved of any wrongdoing either - he has a duty to be caring and supportive of both his wife and daughter. What I am saying though, is that OP is not displaying any support toward her husband during a difficult time and excluding him from their daughter's birthday party is just kicking him when he's already down.", "While I agree that sometimes a man and father can be clueless sometimes (admittedly i'm such a kind of idiot), it's still extremely hurtful if you're deliberately excluded though.\n\nYes, maybe he should have been more involved in that birthday, and the planning and everything.\n\nBut the question: \"Did he even want to come\" is pretty insulting. They are not divorced, and I guess they still live together as well. I don't think he forgot about her birthday or something like this. I guess he didn't even consider for a second he would possibly be excluded without being informed at all. Yes he IS  offended at not being included. And rightfully so.\n\nIs he a stupid moron? Of course. Is it okay to hurt him that way though? Hell no.", "Love this answer. I'm glad somebody spoke up and said NTA.", "Sorry but everything outside of this situation at hand is irrelevant\u2026 the only AH here is OP. I don\u2019t see how their child\u2019s father not being invited and then being upset about it makes him the AH.", "Judgement aside, I don\u2019t think that specific point makes any sense?", "But it\u2019s his kid! Shouldn\u2019t he have asked? \u201cLittle Judy\u2019s birthday is coming up, should we plan her a party?\u201d", "RIGHT?! \n\n100% he didn\u2019t bc he fully expected her to handle it to the extent that all he had to do was show up when and where she told him to. This is very telling of who he is as a husband and father. \n\nI agree she was wrong to not invite him and I would never bc the party is about the child, not me. But I could definitely see being tempted to do what she did and in a space of being depressed or something following through with making the wrong decision.", "YTA in this situation and he definitely sucks. Sorry OP, but your marriage is cooked. GGs and GLHF to both of you in single life", "He forgot his kids birthday?", "Fair -  But is she listening to what's going on with him or only telling him her complaints", "I was going off OP saying he was doing little to nothing to help and them fighting in front of the kid. But I understand your perspective and fully acknowledge that I might be underestimating the situation. Best of luck to you", "I too was wondering when reading if he's her father or not. Her text is so much \"MY daughter\" and HER dream party as if she was the only parent in this family. That attitude is really annoying as we got no information about their f-d-relationship.\n\nYTA for excluding him for no good reason. \nYou haven't mentioned anything to indicate that he didn't pull himself together for YOUR (=both of you)  daughter on this special occasion."]}
