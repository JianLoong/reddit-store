I wanted the occasion to be memorable for Zoe, so I went all out with decorations, a bounce house, and a huge cake. However, I made the decision to not invite my husband, Marc (34M), to the party.\n\nNow for the context, Marc and I have been having some issues in our marriage lately. It's not going very well for him at work and it rubs off on us, he's always grumpy and seems to have little interest in spending time with me and my daugther when he comes back home. I've been juggling my part-time job, taking care of Zoe, and managing the household all by myself while he does little to nothing to help me. I've been feeling overwhelmed and underappreciated lately and I've talked to my husband about this, but he hasn't shown much understanding or support about the situation. We also had a lot of arguments and I know it upsets my daugther to see us like this, but she's still fond of her father.\n\nSo, when it came time to plan Zoe's birthday party, I decided to exclude Marc from the guest list. I just invited my parents, my sister, and a few friends. I wanted me and Zoe to have a happy and stress-free birthday celebration without any tension or drama that could arise if Marc was here. The party was a huge success and Zoe had a blast.\n\nBut Marc found out about it later and he was furious at me and yelled how I was horrible that I didn't even tell him about the birthday party of his own daugther. He accused me of deliberately excluding him and making him feel like a bad father. He said he couldnt believe I would do something like that to him. I told him that I did what I thought was best for me and Zoe and that it wasn't a big deal anyway, that we could arrange something later together but he didn't want to hear anything more and stormed off.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT : To be more specific, my husband knew that I was having a birthday party, I just didn't tell him when, I didn't go into details and I didn't invite the in-laws either. We just had the birthday party on our side me and my daughter. I thought that doing something just the three of us later would be a good compromise and my daughter could spend some time with her father but maybe I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1677767670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g499d/aita_for_not_inviting_my_husband_to_our_daugthers/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Except you're married, so Marc doesn't have specified custody time and would rightfully assume that he'd be included in a singular birthday party. Or at least notified that one was happening!!!\n\nYou're using Zoe to punish Marc and make him look bad. That's toxic and abusive, well beyond AH territory. If you at any point told Zoe that her father couldn't make it, or didn't want to be there, or in any way implied that his absence was not 100% your choice, that's parental alienation. If you're in the US, and Marc can prove this, that can be used to limit the amount of time you have custody of Zoe.\n\nStop wasting Marc's time and get a divorce. You aren't treating him like a husband, or a partner, or even someone you have any affection for at all. If you just need his money to provide for Zoe, that can be done via a child support payment without all the drama.", "YTA. You keep saying what\u2019s best for YOU and Zoey. Zoey is your child.

They are not divorced, and I guess they still live together as well. I don't think he forgot about her birthday or something like this.

My mother and father had plenty of arguments back when I was younger, and it troubled me a lot. I still harbored a great deal of love for them though, and ultimately, they always put their differences aside to put my brother and I first. You know full well she loves him very much despite your two's quibbles, yet in the exact same breath you decide not to invite him. Where's the logic? I've got a simple solution that would have easily worked: how about you two just *not* get into an argument at her birthday and save whatever issues you may have for later. Judging by his reaction to finding out you didn't invite him - where he was completely in the right by the way - I'd say he's smart enough to know that there is a time and place for everything, to save the drama for later and be all smiles for your daughter.\n\nI may not know what your husband's exact situation is, but I can almost guarantee that the love your daughter has for him is reciprocated by him. Stuff happens working a full-time job like he does. It's only natural that he'd have several days where he'd come home stressed, tired, moody, or whatnot and not have as much time for your kid. Doesn't mean he isn't thinking about her: otherwise, he wouldn't still be here with you as the bread winner.\n\nConsidering the fact that you even thought about doing what you did, and still thinking so nonchalantly that it was perfectly fine and, in your own words when he confronted you over it, not a big deal, doesn't speak well of you at all. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if you're part of the reason why your husband often comes back the way he does and you two get into arguments.\n\nIf you were so worried about not stressing out your child, you should have invited him to the party. He's her father and has every right to be first in line to be there for his baby girl's special day. There would be no argument of this sort between you and him after the fact, and there would be no chance your daughter would perk up about what's going on, and upon realizing the situation, potentially get upset. This is the kind of stuff that causes divorces to happen, and in turn, ruining a young child's mind. Should've thought about this, but judging by everything I've read and heard, it seems you're only ever thinking about yourself.\n\nYou're not just an asshole, you're also stupid.

Your job as a parent is to be there for the kid.  That means tea parties, playing in the sand box with them, dress up, dolls, ect...  It also means that the work to make sure they are healthy and well adjusted is needed.  Baths, cooking, cleaning, play dates, homework, etc...  You are a failure of a parent if you opt out.\n\nThe mom has, at least a part time job.  She is also a full time maid, chef, chauffeur, home health aid, parent,  and social worker.  You add up all the unpaid labor the mom does, that goes into being the main provider of childcare and person who does the majority of the housework, she is putting in more hours with less thanks.  Any job that you get to go home from is easier and less stressful than all that.  \n\nPlus, you have to be WAY out of touch if your spouse CAN plan a party and you not know about it.  It is his daughter.  He knew her birthday.  (Or if he didn't, again he fails)  He never once thought to ask who, what, when, where, how much?  He assumed that he can come home from work, not take care of his daughter, not spend time with his wife and daughter, but somehow be told about it?  Doesn't work that way.  How little work to be part of a family are you going to side with him for?  \n\nOr do you honestly expect his wife to stand in between him and whatever he is choosing to do that ISN'T taking time with his wife and daughter, and ISN'T doing housework, and ISN'T showing ANY interest in his family, and fill him in on all the details?", "He knew there was going to be a party but he didn\u2019t care to find out when it was.", "I edited to \u2018their\u2019 moments after posting, I noticed that too.

These are not the actions of a very nice person.", "YTA, like massively the AH.\n\nEverything you\u2019ve wrote is you, you, you. This entire post is about how things make you feel.

Your frustration is understandable, but you crossed a major line by weaponizing your daughter's birthday party.

Major AH move.", "YTA", "Sometimes I'm so shocked how people can't see that they're the AH.

Also question why the hell your family also didn't tell you what you were doing was wrong.", "YTA and if you arent careful, you could be done for parental alienation if this ended up in divorce. You dont invite a childs father to their birthday party, thats kind of standard that they will be there. This is one of those times where you put your big girl pants on regardless of the issues in your marriage and celebrate your daughters birthday together. Of course it was a big deal! The best thing for Zoe would have been to have both her parents there. Awful thing to have done. Why are your side of the family more important than the paternal side of the family too?", "YTA. I would have divorce papers in your hand by the end of the week if it were me. That was just low of you. Absolutely low.", "Well when they get a divorce, because she didn't just not invite husband, she didn't invite any one from good side of the family.
