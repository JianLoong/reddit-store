I  suppose I am worried it's just the petty side of myself and the fact  that I may simply have teenage angst going on. My father married his  wife precovid, bringing three step-children into his life. My father has  been pushing for me to meet them, though I have no desire. It is mostly  because I have bad social anxiety. I have gotten way better around my  mothers side of the family, but I think the factor that I grew up around  those people definitely helps, but even if I am feeling anxious I have  people that I am very comfortable with to stick by. When it comes to  possibly meeting these people I do not know, I would have nobody to go  to. I am not comfortable around my father or my stepmother, so for me  that would basically mean I am alone.\n\nMy  father was in town a bit ago, and he texted me to make plans to get  together. I have had no desire to see him for a while, but I agreed  regardless. We made plans, and when the day came he told me his  step-children would be coming over to his wife's house for a barbecue. I  was not told about this the day we made plans. So learning that, I told  him I would not like to come. I was not comfortable with not being told  beforehand, and I war certainly not comfortable going for the reasons I  mentioned prior. It was asked if I wanted to see him the day after, and  I told him we would need to play it by ear. I had plans the next day,  and I was not sure if I wanted to cancel them.\n\nAt  8 something in the morning, I text him that I was free and asked what  time he might be around. He said him and his wife had plans so it might  be in the afternoon, to which I said if they could not make it that it  was okay. Long story short, he basically told me telling him we'd have  to play it by ear was wrong, and regarding not wanting to see his  step-children? I was called selfish and arrogant.\n\nI  myself have not put in a lot of effort to have a relationship with him,  but that is because at this point I do not want one. I grew up without  my father, and the damage has already been done. Another thing is I am  the one who gets blamed for it, at least that is how it seems. His wife  used to text me saying to contact him, or he himself has blamed me as of  late with this drama. I am the child, it should not rely solely on me. I  am tired of it. Another thing to mention is that he sees his wife's  children more than he sees me, and it seems as though he makes a bigger  effort with them than he does with me. This makes me feel as if I am  being replaced, and it hurts but sadly I am used to it. I cannot bring  myself to proofread this, so I am highly aware it will most likely make  little to no sense. I suppose I'm just looking for a place to express my  feelings on this with people who aren't my family as they are bound to  be a bit biased.

That\u2019s perfectly acceptable.", "Nta. Dad taught you not to want him in your life. You don't owe anyone anything here except yourself and your own well being.", "OK I think NTA. You're all making choices here about who you want in your life, but your father is calling you names about it. He's not just expressing disappointment, he's trying to bully you.\n\nBe aware though that by not meeting your stepsiblings you're burning a bridge. You're rejecting his new family just as much as you feel he's rejecting yours. Do you want that?", "NAH, but you really need to work through this, because you keep contradicting yourself. You say that you hate how they keep pressuring you, but then you complain about them not spending time with you, when you keep pushing them back. I think you need some professional therapy to find out what you actually want.", "NTA\n\nYour father sounds a lot like mine (That\u2019s not a compliment).\n\nYour father is the one who needs to step up here. You are a child! He is the one that needs to be making the bigger effort to fix things. However, it sounds like he doesn\u2019t truly understand what all of the issues really are. You could always try writing him a letter, and lay it all out for him. Tell him everything you feel. Tell him that you are willing to attempt to mend your relationship, but only through therapy (don\u2019t try to do this one on one). And if he is serious about fixing things, he will set up and pay for the appointments, and go as many times as is necessary. \n\nOnce you establish a relationship with him and feel comfortable with him, then you can worry about meeting your step-siblings. \n\nBest wishes to you sweetheart! Virtual hugs!!", "He is the father, and the parent - altho it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s not been doing well at fulfilling those roles. But that means it\u2019s HIS responsibility to make sure that you feel safe and comfortable with any situations where you need to interact, and be the one who makes concessions to allow you to feel confident in his understanding and support, and not place that responsibility on you. It might help as someone else said to put your feelings down in writing, and for him to respond in the same way, so you have a non-confrontational way to understand each other\u2019s feelings. He\u2019s the parent and he needs to step up if he\u2019s going to have any chance at a relationship with you. You could even show him this thread. You\u2019ve expressed yourself really well. Good luck and NTA.", "NTA. You said you grew up without your father and you also said that you do not feel comfortable around him. That doesn't sound like a good father-daughter-relationship and - you being the child here - it's probably his fault that things turned that way.\n\nYour father knows - or at least should know - about your social anxiety. So when you declined meeting his whole family when you only had agreed to meet him alone he should have accepted it instead of calling you selfish and arrogant. You have no obligation at all to meet his stepchilden. Of course it would be nice if could meet them one day and you all got along just fine, but if he can't respect your needs how to approach this than it's better not to meet at all.\n\nI wish you all the best and hope things will get better with your social anxiety.", "NTA in this instance, since he sprung it on you last minute.\n\nAnd I agree it's up to him to make the effort.\n\nBut you really do need to meet them at some point, so think about how you *would* be willing to meet them , and have your father bring those circumstances about. (Maybe have dinner, or go to a museum or something, with your dad and one step-sibling at a time?)", "Info:  Have you met his wife before?  Why have you not met her children already eg at their wedding, are her kids older and have left home?\n\nUltimately, NTA. Does this man make any positive contribution to your life or contribute finanially? It sounds like your dad has no custody or visitation rights so you have no obligation to continue the relationship. His wife shouldn't be contacting you either.  Maybe you should block their numbers and get on with your life.", "NTA. I have been in a similar boat for years with my mom.\n\nIt took my parents years to realize I wasn't avoiding social situations and niceties out of rudeness but social and physical anxiety. \n\nA few years ago after too many \"I'll call you back\" responses from my Mom, no surprise most of the time she never did, I decided if she didn't see check in calls with me to be a priority for her like they were with her and my siblings then the contact ball is in her court. I know she would have conversations with my siblings when they'd call because sometimes I would be at the house talking to my  mom when they would call and she never said \"hey I'm busy with talking to your sibling I'll call you back\"\n\nAnd as a side note my check ins were mostly along the lines of \"Hey I\u2019m still alive. Just letting you know verbally so you don't think some random person is answering texts\" calls since I hate talking on the phone that would have been less than 5 minutes. \n\nSometimes I think parents avoid the realization that their communication with kids should be treated the same way as their communication with best friends or co workers... it's a two way street and it takes work and commitment on both sides.", "NTA. My dad is getting married later this year. My mum is dating her boyfriend. Both have kids.\n\nStep-kids are awkward. Meeting them is even worse.\n\nHowever, I would try and get meeting them over and done with. Your dad will nag you less. Now after meeting them I can at least say I don't like them and don't want to go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad calls you when he's in town to maybe see you. He yells when you disagree with him. He hasn't spoken to you since January. \n\n>Long story short, he basically told me telling him we'd have to play it by ear was wrong, and regarding not wanting to see his step-children? I was called selfish and arrogant.\n\n>I grew up without my father, and the damage has already been done.\n\nI think you can be done with bothering with dad. You don't even have a relationship with him and he wants to take you to his wife's parents' house to meet his step kids? That's an emotional trap environment because it's difficult to leave. NTA. You don't actually have to meet your dad's step kids.", "NTA  -your father doesn't really bother to make family arrangements.  In most families its the wife and if the wife doesn't do it, then the husband has to go out of his way.  there is certainly only evidence of that in your account\n\nYour father didn't build a relationship with you because that would have taken effort on his part.  His relationship with the step children is only because his wife arranges things.  They were willing to slot you in at that time but when you said no, the considered the obligation satisfied.  If you want to meet your father, it will only be on his and his wife's terms", "NTA - And even if you were, so what? Your feelings are your feelings. He's your father and he hasn't been much of a father to you, so if you want to reject him, do it. He'll just have to learn to deal with it. I think a 15 year old has a right to their own feelings.", "It has also been said by my mother that his family was told she wasn't allowing him to see me when I was younger. I think soon after one of his friends local to my city told my mom he was in town around the same time he told his family that, but he was out drinking with buddies", "I do not want that kind of father. If this is how our relationship would be, I would rather not have a father at all", "I suppose I didn't really make that clear, huh? I'm sorry about that, I was a bit frantic trying to get it all out. I didn't mean for it to come off as complaining, I suppose I was just trying to explain the situation? At this point I'm used to it all, and I posted this because I really just needed to know if I was being brat. I know that I don't want him in my life, though. This all goes much deeper than what I was able to put in the post, but regardless is would just be completely trauma dumping", "At this point, I think it goes beyond that y'know? I don't think I can handle being around him after being called those things by my own father. I hope that makes sense?", "I have met her multiple time, yes. I've only bet one out of her three children, who was at the wedding. That was the only time we met.\n\nHe sends child support.", "He hasn't contacted me since January after we had this conversation, and I feel like I would be going against myself by reaching out to make that happen. Is that wrong?", "I'm always going to be wary of getting all your info from one source on issues like this. She might well be a saint, but your mum has her biases too.\n\nMaybe you would benefit from having a written discussion with your father where you can lay out your feelings and give him an opportunity to respond. \nWritten because being in the room with him and having that discussion isn't going to be great for anxiety.", "My real father was like this. I lost very little by staying away from him.", "I don't think you're a brat, I think you're going thorough a lot and I think you would benefit from talking to somebody a bit better equipped to helping you than strangers on the internet. Because while there's nothing wrong with going NC for the rest of your life, I also sense a lot of hurt and grief and you better work on it now. Not in order to mend things with your father, but in order for yourself to move on and grow. You're still young, so you got the chance to do it before it fucks up the next 20 years of your life.", "Thanks for your reply. Sounds like your dad doesn't know you very well and is only interested in having a relationship on his terms. \n\nHe has close local contacts so you could invite him someday to meet him on your terms? Then explain to him that you need to have advance notice to meet his step children and make a plan to meet them at a neutral location where you can have friends there to support you \n\nI have step siblings that I've never met, even though my dad has been married to my step mother for over 20 years. She's lovely but so painfully shy and private.", "That really sucks. I'm sorry. Im not sure if you should reach out to him or not, as you know your relationships best i guess but that probably doesn't help :/", "Sometimes we just have to test the waters to see if the other person or even ourselves have changed in opinionor feelings. It's one on the reasons I sometimes just text my dad and say either 'I'm still alive' or what makes people laugh when I tell them I texted my dad 'I'm not dead'", "I should have mentioned this in the post, but I reached the word limit. I have never spoken my true feelings to my father because I was afraid of being yelled at. I told him why I didn't wish to meet his step-children, and I was yelled at. I always get turned into the bad guy whenever I share my true feelings, so now the thought kind of scares me", "Don't you dare apologize! This is not your problem <3 I appreciate your kind words", "Honestly, I'm probably not the best person to give advice.\nBut in your position I'd refuse to communicate unless it's in writing. \nI'd be clear about why too \"your physical expression of anger intimidates me and makes it impossible for me to communicate with you. I refuse to be shouted at, it will not change my mind. All it does is push me further away from you. You don't need to agree with everything I say or feel, but those feelings won't improve by adding more negative interactions with you.\"\nThe alternative is just not talking with him at all.", "You don't know how much this helps me, thank you so much!", "One last thing.\nParents are just human beings, as flawed and fucked up and desperate for love as anyone.\nYou obviously don't have him on a pedestal, but also understand that there is room for him to change and do better. \nSet your terms and stick to them, but don't expect people to read your mind, be clear about how you feel and what you want.", "Tell him before you start attempting to build a relationship with his new wife and children doesn\u2019t he think it would be better if the two of you had some kind of relationship. That you feel you both would need to meet together alone to work things out before being forced to play happy families just for his egos sake.", "I'm not sure I'd take a pop at his ego, he doesn't seem very capable of emotional regulation or introspection. \nBut this, yes.", "NTA.\n\nYour father is a bully, so of course you're uncomfortable about the whole relationship.\n\nAn idea: Don't try to reach out to him anymore. Don't try to please him. Don't feel guilty. He can't be pleased and you're not guilty of anything.\n\nAnd what reason is there for you to meet your step-siblings? Maybe you'd like them, maybe not. But so what? You can leave things as they are. Maybe some time in the future there will be a big wedding and you can meet them then if you want.\n\nBut only if you want. Don't let anyone bully into something using cliches of \"family\" etc. If you feel uncomfortable about something, go with that feeling and say no.\n\nNo is a beautiful word, especially when family want something. On my tombstone, let them engrave, \"This was the only time he couldn't say no.\"", "NTA. He's the parent in this situation but he hasn't acted like one to you.  You don't owe him anything and should not be expected to sacrifice your own comfort to appease him. It's his responsibility to work on his relationship with you and figure out a way to make you feel comfortable meeting his stepchildren. He shouldn't just force it on you. I do think it could be beneficial for you to have a conversation with him and explain the way you've been feeling, but only if you feel up to it.", "NTA for not wanting to make a connection with your steps when you don\u2019t have one with your father. But you are doing a disservice to yourself if your social anxiety stops you from participating with others in your life. Please find help with a counselor or psychiatrist"]}
