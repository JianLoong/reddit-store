She was definitely a daddy's girl growing up. The issue is that I always questioned in the back of my head if she was truly mine as my ex has never been loyal but the younger 2 look identical to me. 9yro looks like neither of us.\n\nMy ex and I got a divorce 2 months after my youngest was born as the marriage wasn't healthy, she kept being unfaithful but we stayed together for the kids till it got too much.\n\nRecently, something itched me recently to get a paternity test done to see if my worries were correct. A friend suggested it as he pointed out how my 9yro looks nothing like me and that there was only one way to know.\n\nSurprisingly my ex didn't even fight me on this and let me get the test done. Turns out that the little two are mine but the 9 year old isn't. My ex claims she agreed as she really was confident all 3 where mine.\n\nAs ashamed of it as I am, I can't bring myself to look at her. It hurts everytime I see her face. I care about her still but it's weird, like out of nowhere all that love I had for her disappeared and I cant see her as my own.\n\nI went to come get my kids for the week I have with them. I get the little two in the car and my 9 year old comes out and says she's ready to go to my house. But I couldn't do it. I felt nothing looking at her. I want to spend time with my kids not another person's kid. \n\nSo I told her she isn't coming and I told her that she had a daddy out there but it isn't me anymore. I'm not paying child support for her anymore. Only for the 2 I made. \n\nKid has been sending me messages on her phone (she had it due to living in two homes). She sent me voice messages crying. But honestly it doesn't make me feel anything. She keeps saying \"but your my daddy.\"\n\nI told my mom about the situation as she questioned where the girl was but she blew up in my face and told me I was an asshole for abandoning a child.\n\nBut she isn't my child, and I can't even look at her. Why is it my fault for my wife's actions?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682708501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1326nql/aita_for_not_seeing_my_kid_after_finding_out_she/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I\u2019m sitting here as a 24yr old woman nearly in tears over the thought of my dad walking out on me at 9 years old. And before you try to reiterate that you\u2019re not her dad, in that little girls eyes, YES YOU ARE. Nobody else ever will be. \n\nI truly hope you can pull your head out of your ass before you completely ruin her, but if you\u2019re truly willing to treat a child like shit over this, don\u2019t even bother. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t abundantly clear, YTA.", "YTA and heartless that child did nothing to you it was her mother who couldn\u2019t help but spread her legs for someone else but that little girl did nothing to you to deserve now your treating her", "Huge YTA\n\nWtf? She's 9. She's still your kid. If the only thing that made you care about her in the first place was your shared DNA, then you didn't really love her in the first place. \n\nShe's a child. Tf did she do? Why take your anger out on her? \n\nGod forbid you found out the other 2 weren't yours. Would you be out of their lives for good too?\n\n>Why is it my fault for my wife's actions?\n\nIt's not. It's your fault for being a bad father.\n\nYou're not a father. A father wouldn't abandon a kid because they aren't theirs. You never deserved these kids.", "I can't believe I'm reading something so awful. You're hurt and taking it out on a child. A child whose dad suddenly doesn't want her anymore, through no fault of her own. She's crushed, and probably will be for the rest of her life. What an utterly vile, despicable thing you did. You say you're ashamed. You should be. If you ever cared for her, fix this. Do the right thing for YOUR daughter. She's yours because you raised her and she loves you. YTA.", "YTA. You don't have to pay child support, but that poor girl has just lost her father. She doesn't care about whether or not you share DNA. She loves her Daddy. The person who has been her dad every day for her whole life. It is not her fault that her mother cheated on you, and it isn't fair to punish her for something she had no control over. You were needlessly cruel to a child who just wants her dad.", "I get that you\u2019re hurt and feel like you\u2019ve been lied to all this time by your wife. Notice the two key words in that sentence? Your. Wife. Your daughter had nothing to do with your wife\u2019s transgressions and shouldn\u2019t be shunned because of it. You chose to stay with your wife knowing she\u2019s cheated in the past. Punish your wife but not your little girl. If you were as close to your daughter as you claim then that bond should be thicker than blood. She\u2019s gonna be hurt by enough people in her life, you don\u2019t need to be the one that starts it. If a father\u2019s love is conditional then you\u2019re just not a father in my opinion. Not even to the other two. YTA. Work through these emotions. Realize it\u2019s your ex\u2019s fault and that\u2019s who your issue is with. Get over yourself. Then make it up to that little girl who couldn\u2019t care less if you\u2019re her biological father or not.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, if you are on the birth certificate, you are LEGALLY the dad. \n\nSecond, as someone who found out later in life that my dad is not my dad.....it is an absolutely mindblowing lifechanging disorienting thing. I cannot IMAGINE being a CHILD and not only dealing with that but also being abandoned by the only father I'd ever known.\n\nI do truly understand this has been a shock for you too. But YOU ARE THE ADULT. YOU ARE THE ADULT. YOU ARE THE ADULT. \n\nPlease call that child up right now and tell her you are sorry, that you will make it up to her, that you will always be HER dad, and then beat feet and both of you get into counselling STAT before you do any more damage. \n\nBecause you are doing real measurable damage to that child, right now, that will have lifetime ramifications. \n\nI'm sorry you were lied to by your wife, I'm sorry you are having to deal with this, but that innocent child should not pay the price for what ADULTS did.", "YTA for abandoning a little girl who has only known you has her father for 9 years. She's clearly old enough to feel heartbroken. How can you listen to a child that you raised for 9 years crying on the phone and not feel anything?\n\nTo be clear, your wife is an AH and her infidelity is not excusable, but please don't take it out on an innocent kid. Your child did *nothing* wrong. I suggest going to therapy, if you haven't already, to find a way to not project your negative emotions on and blame your daughter.", "YTA, holy crap... that poor girl...    \n\n\nIf you ever get remarried and that person has a kid, are you just gonna ignore them too?  \n\n\nThis whole, I didn't make you, so it's not possible for me to love you thing is so fucked in the head.", "YTA supermarket makes you a father but comforting her when she is sick, cheering her on when she tries new things, teaching her how to grow up to be a good person, taking her to the park, dealing with nightmares, knowing what her favorite dessert is, these things are what make a daddy. Abandoning her for this or treating her any differently than you have her whole life is one of the biggest asshole moves I have seen on here. You are not just an asshole you are king of the assholes. You are an adult, act like it", "Do you want the girl that loved you her entire life to hate you? That every happy moment she had in her life with you to turn sour and be replaced with sadness, self-loathing, anger, and abandonment?\n\nThis will affect your other two children as well. Even if you treat them well they will see that you are willing to hurt an innocent little girl and may grow to see you as a monster rather than as a good man.\n\nYour wife screwed up and now this little girl is paying the price.", "YTA. And so is your wife. Get therapy for you and not-your-daughter. She is going to need it.", "YTA and you need to get yourself into therapy stat before you hurt her any more than you have already done.  This is NOT her fault and you are treating her like it is.", "YTA. She's your daughter because you raised her for 9 years. Why are you punishing this child for something the mother did? Yeah, it was f***ed up. But, my god, bring yourself to treat her better because your other daughters still have her as a sister and they will judge you for this when they're older.", ">I told my mom about the situation as she questioned where the girl was but she blew up in my face and told me I was an asshole for abandoning a child.\n\nYTA, I mean, if your mom told you she doesn't love you and can't look at you and doesn't want to be around you ever again, how would you feel?", "YTA at a heartbreaking breath taking level. Dude you just ruined a kids life - forever", "YTA\n\nYou raised her for 9 whole years. I cannot even begin to imagine the hurt this little girl is feeling.", "100% YTA\n\nYou are punishing an innocent little girl you have cared for her entire life. To her, you *are* daddy. She doesn't want some stranger she's never met before. She wants the person who raised her.\n\nAlthough, if this is how you are going to act, then maybe she dodged a bullet. I wouldn't want to be raised by someone so heartless.", "YTA.\n\nYou raised her for 9 years and all she's ever known is that you are her daddy. To immediately change and tell her you aren't and leave her must have been so devastating to her. What your ex wife did is not this childs fault. I can understand not wanting to pay child support but to just abandon her like that is cruel.", "YTA. You are maybe the biggest asshole I've ever seen on this sub. You will fuck this 3rd grader up forever if you continue this way.", "YTA, at least as in not seeing that child anymore.\n\nYour ex-wife was shit but the child sees you as her parent. Hear my plead and be a better divorced parent by being there for her. Be a father\n\n\nOH, and NTa for not paying child support tho", "YTA - How can you punish this kid like this? Yes, she is not yours but that doesnt erase the years of bonding that she had. This is cruel beyond words to someone who did nothing wrong to you.", "Wow, YTA in a big way. She still thinks of you as her daddy. How could you destroy a child\u2019s world like that? She doesn\u2019t understand why daddy doesn\u2019t love her anymore, and she will need a lifetime of therapy to get over you abandoning her. You knew your wife was cheating, why are you surprised the child isn\u2019t yours? I agree you shouldn\u2019t pay child support, but she can\u2019t turn her feelings off like you apparently can.", "YTA. No matter what your ex did, that child is innocent. You\u2019re fucked in the head", "YTA. \n\nI was going to write some lines about how you could have sucked it up for the time it took for  to get the 9 year old some counseling and manage a transition to you not treating her like your daughter.\n\nThen, I read comments by you answering other posts which were so dismissive and ignorant of how children think and the mental damage the adults they trust can do to them. Now, I am not sorry for the 9 year old but feel horrible for the other two kids who are still stuck with you as their father.", "YTA doesn't even come close to describing it.  You're that little girl's dad in her eyes, and now you've walked out of her life.  She's still the daughter you loved, she hasn't changed.  finding out she wasn't yours didn't change her from the little girl that you loved.  You need help, and some counseling for sure, but that little girl needs her dad.  She needs you to show her what a man and dad should be so that she doesn't end up with the same issues your ex seems to have with infidelity.", "Total and complete ass. Instead of seeking therapy to help you process and work through this, you\u2019ve caused major, deep cutting trauma to a young child whom this will have lasting effects on as she grows. Do better", "Wow. YTA. This 9 year old has known you as her father her whole life. My parents divorced when I was very young and on top of having a loving father, my stepfather also treats me as his own daughter. I cannot imagine throwing away love for any child after 9 years of loving them. This breaks my heart for the little girl and will probably cause your biological kids to view you differently when they are old enough to understand your actions.", "Sure, it's not your fault, but YTA. Both can be true, hope that helps", "How do you raise a child for 9 years and turn your back on them at the drop of a hat?\n\nYOU ARE HER FATHER regardless of DNA.  Get your head out of your ass, seek therapy, and stop punishing an innocent child. JFC", "Yes YTA\n\nHolding the sins of the mother against a child that you said essentially was the one you were closest to.\n\nThere is a WHOLE lot more to family than DNA.", "You have 2 options. Get therapy for yourself now... Or pay for her therapy. Because you are going to be responsible for her trauma.\n\nYTA.\n\nFine, you are not the father. But you are hurting a 9 years old for whom you ARE HER FATHER.", "I hope you realize you have created life long trauma and abandonment for this innocent child. I understand being distraught over her not being yours. I even understand not continuing child support to the mother for her, but you can't simply stop being her dad. She grew up with you as her father. You are her father, blood relation or not. \n\nI seriously cannot imagine the pain she is in. I can't imagine going out to my dad and him turning his back on me Lome that because I turned out to not be his. \n\nAs I've said, you have every right to your anger towards your ex and every right to be hurt. However, you are hurting the innocent child mixed into all of this. She didn't make her mom cheat. She didn't ask to be born. Now her father has rejected her and is actively punishing her for being born. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nHow do you look at a child you raised for 9 years crying for you and feel nothing? That's a major deficit on your part.", "YTA. Yes your ex\u2019s behaviour is appalling and you\u2019re right to feel betrayed. But its not the child\u2019s fault and you just handled this in the cruelest way possible. You\u2019ve just destroyed the world of an innocent child for your own ego. Your mother was right to blow up at you.", "You're a monster. Not just an AH. She is 9 years old. What's wrong with people?\n\nDon't matter how you feel, you don't go and mistreat a 9 years old. You have caused irreparable damage to a child you say you loved. YTA x10000000\n\nEdit: for the comments you're also trying to alienate her brother. Gesss", "YTA - and you might be in the running for AH of the century.  You raised this 9 YEAR OLD GIRL  for 9 YEARS and you can drop her like a rock?  The girl loves you, and you're the only dad she knows.  You have no love for the girl you raised as you own for almost a decade because there is proof you don't share DNA?  Her two siblings go to HER DAD'S HOUSE while she stays at home because you stopped loving her over something completely out of her control.  In what world do you think that destroying a girls life is justified by you being cheated on?", "YTA. That little girl will have considerable trauma from you abandoning her. As far as she's concerned you are her dad. Seems like your punishing a child for something that isn't her fault. I do not understand how you can raise a child for 9 years and then throw her aside. Stop taking your pain out on a child", "YTA you have hurt a child that had nothing to do with the nonsense... I had a bond with her and this is what u do... total AH... you will regret your actions...", "YTA. If you can spend 9 years being this girl's father and turn it off like a switch and feel absolutely nothing that she's crying, upset, and her world is shattered, there's something wrong with you. I feel bad for those other 2 kids--one day they'll probably do something that will turn that switch, too, and you'll abandon them.", "YTA. Jesus that was heartless.", "Jesus christ, when the younger 2 grow up and realise what kind of man you are, you can kiss them goodbye. YTA", "Jesus fuck OP\n\nAssholes not enough. There should be a higher sub called am I Satan?", "YTA, if you have a hard time processing the fact that she isn\u2019t biologically yours, go for counselling. This innocent child considers you her father and after nine years of raising her it\u2019s mind boggling you can\u2019t look past biology.", "Asshole is way to nice a word for a monster like you. My god this actually brought tears to my eyes, your poor daughter. YTA", "Yta sorry dude, you're her dad. Legally and emotionally. To make it worse, you're still taking her siblings and nor her. You're punishing *a child* for your wife's choices.  She is still the same person she was before you found out.", "YTA. It isn't her fault. You've raised her and the only father she knows. I get not paying child support but you shouldn't abandon her.", "I agree with not paying child support for her, but YTA for abandoning this child who thinks of you as her father. How could you hear voice messages of her crying for her dad and feel nothing! It breaks my heart just hearing about it.", "Jesus Christ, I cannot fathom being this fucking heartless to a child. YTA and you need to remember THAT GIRL\u2019S ENTIRELY LIFE YOU HAVE BEEN HER DAD, your emotions? They are yours to work through, you\u2019re going through something, but my god, why did you need to be such an asshole to that poor kid.", "Oh dude - please stop trying to defend yourself. Every comment I read makes you a bigger AH then the last.\n\nLook, I know you are hurt but you are hurting this innocent child even more.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Blood related or not, you have been her father for the past 9 years. She IS your child. Sure, you don't have to pay child support for her anymore. But she still deserves better than you abandoning her because your ego is bruised.", "YTA. Please seek some therapy to deal with your feelings of betrayal so you don't make your so-called \"daddy's girl\" suffer any more.", "YTA get fucked, you\u2019re abandoning a girl that you were raising as your own and punishing her for your ex\u2019s shitheaded-ness. Does that sound fucking FAIR to you? To hurt a fucking 9-YEAR-OLD that way???", "YTA. \n\nIf you're so heartless that you can just start ignoring a child you raised for 9 years in an instant, then I doubt you ever felt any real love for her. That's still your daughter, regardlessof who donated thei DNA. If this had been a 3-month old, it would be different, but it's been almost a decade. You're not the sperm donor, boo hoo, but you're STILL her father. Don't punish your daughter for what your ex did.", "YTA. \nI lived through this myself. I was that nine year old girl. \nPlease do not punish the daughter. I know you must be hurt but you are the adult. This is going to be hard no matter what. You need family therapy.\nYou say you've always been close to her. You raised her. Surely you can feel something for this child, you don't have to punish her. Be the adult and work it out with your wife.", "Your daughter didn't ask nor choose who her father was. You are blaming her for your ex's actions. Stop unfairly punishing her for this, and think about the 9 great years you've had with her so far.\n\nYour ex is to blame for all of this. Don't make your daughter collateral damage.", "YTA a giant one at that.  \nFirst of all I totally understand how you feel, right now you're numb, this is self-preservation on your brain's part. You have a right to be upset.   \nNow on the part why I think you're a huge asshole. You're punishing a kid for the actions in which she didn't partake and were completely out of her control. You wrecked her whole world, you isolated her and singled her out from her siblings, she grew up knowing one and only one dad, and you completely shattered that. How would your 9 year old self have felt if your dad just one day told you are not his son and he isn't your dad anymore. It's like a slap in the face, you rescinded your love for her and totally spat in her face. You also took a big dump on your own effort to build a loving parent child relationship for the 9 years you had her. What makes us a family is not blood relations but love and relationships. Sharing DNA does not define a what a family is, the relationship does. OP I seriously advise you to take a step back and do some soul searching. You wronged a child in a very cruel way, because of your insecurities.   \n\n\n>Why is it my fault for my wife's actions?   \n\n\nYour wife is at fault for cheating, she isn't at fault for you abandoning the child you were a father to for 9 years and for that you are a huge asshole, and a selfish one at that.", "YTA.

Oh my god this makes my chest hurt, that poor little girl.  What a vile, evil thing you have done to her.  She will not recover from this, its too late.  She may learn some coping strategies to deal with this as she gets older but the damage you have done is monstrous and permanent.  I don't even know what would be best for her at this point, because there is no chance that this can be repaired.", "YTA. So you never actually loved her. You viewed her as an extension of yourself and now that you no longer see her that way, she holds no value to you as a human being deserving of love and care. \n\nYou\u2019re the only father she\u2019s ever known and you\u2019ve abandoned her.

Feel free to be \u201cscorched earth\u201d pissed at your STBX, but the kid is blameless.\n\nLet me tell you something, Karma is a bitch with a 14 inch strap on and you WILL get fucked.\n\nOne way or another, this is gonna come back on you, and it\u2019s not gonna be pretty.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re punishing a child you\u2019ve raised for 9 years, for the mistakes her mother made. And you\u2019re doing it in front of her siblings too. \n\nYour pain is understandable, but your actions are unforgivable.", "YTA. Reading this broke my heart for that little girl. You're the only dad she's ever had and she loves you. None of this is her fault. I guess legally you have no obligation but she is still a person....", "Are you out of your mind? OF COURSE YTA! Man you are cruel and heartless. I have no words. Utter crap behaviour on your part. Did you ever love her? \n\nJust going to repeat you are the bloody arse here! Cause what I really want to say will get me banned.", "YTA - Being the sperm donor doesn't make you a real father.  I really hope you get over the betrayal you feel toward your ex-wife, but this is clearly not your daughter's problem.", "YTA. Your wife hurt you, so now you lash out at the 9 year old child that you raised? The cruelty speaks volumes of the type of person you are.", "YTA. You are honestly so pathetic. If your name is on the cert and you\u2019ve been her father for 9 years, you\u2019re her father. You don\u2019t get to just stop paying child support. You don\u2019t get to throw her out like trash. She is a human being. Get therapy.", "YTA - This is horrible.", "YTA. Blood doesn't equal family, you raised this kid for nine years. Why does her not being biologically yours make a difference? My step-dad has raised me since I was two years old, he's the only father figure I've had. He's my dad. You pushing away that little girl is incredibly cruel. Get over it. She's your kid, regardless of whether or not she shares your genes.", "As straightforward as the vast majority of the responses here are. I will say that this is a gutwrenching situation for you and all 3 children.\n\nI don't think you're an AH for no longer wanting to pay child support for the eldest. There's another person out there that your wife knows that needs to step up for that imo.\n\nI acknowledge how difficult it must be to pretend that nothings wrong for the same of the children. Especially when having to look at the eldests face. There's very few people that can say for sure they wouldn't be hurt in that position.\n\nWhat makes you an AH is how you went about breaking this news. You just showed up one day and told a child \"Hey I'm not your Daddy anymore. Go kick rocks.\" That is horrible, and I will be shocked if any of your loved ones can look at you the same way again.\n\nYou and your equally AH (ex)wife needed to sit down and figure this out. She needs to get it touch with the biodad and figure out how involved he's going to be in that little girls life. Until that, and the divorce and custody gets sorted. If you can't bring yourself to look at that little girl, then you should have stayed away from all of them. For there own good, and perhaps yours.\n\nESH (Not including the kids obviously)", "W.O.W\n\nForget being an asshole....you are an epically horrible human being.\n\nGet a soul", "I feel your pain and struggle, but YTA for destroying that little kid's trust and love for you.", "YTA. Stop being a baby. What are you thinking\n The poor child doesn't deserve you. Is it her fault what her mother did?", "You Are A HUGE Asshole! \n\nTHIS IS A CHILD.", "YTA YTA YTA!!!!! What a horrible thing to do to that little girl! You should be ashamed of yourself!", "YTA and heartless. You can't change how you feel but the fact that \"all that love\" disappeared when you found out she wasn't biologically yours makes me wonder if you actually know how to love at all. I'm not the type to condone cheating ever but I can understand why your wife didn't want to be loyal to you. I hope your daughter gets some therapy and learns quickly that she's better off without you.", "YTA. You raised that kid. For her you are her father, no matter how you see it. It was shit that your ex cheated, I truly empathise, but you cannot blame your ex for your behaviour towards the child. You are abandoning a kid that did nothing wrong. You are deciding genetics are worth more than love or actions. You are fucking with a child's emotions who is losing her father overnight. Weak sauce. Seriously. Your behaviour towards that child is on you.", "YTA. I agree with the therapy comments, it sounds like it would be beneficial. I understand you\u2019re upset but don\u2019t take it out on a little girl. There\u2019s no good reason to punish her for her mother\u2019s infidelity", "You\u2019re disgusting! What a monster. That poor girl. My heart breaks for her. YTA", "YTA, disgusting.", "YTA. I don\u2019t blame you for your feelings. This situation really sucks and your wife absolutely has a lot of responsibility to take for this, but so do you. \n\nYou questioned the child\u2019s paternity and didn\u2019t do anything about it for years. You say that you only want to be a dad to the ones that you \u201cmade\u201d, but is your sperm contribution all it takes to be a father? Step fathers are fathers too because they contribute to being there for the child, which you have done for 9 years. \n\nThis child loves you, related or not. She can see past the genetics, why can\u2019t you?\n\nIf you feel nothing when you look at her, you should seek mental health counseling. It sounds like you have a lot of emotions to deal with and you could benefit with some help doing this.

Good lord, wtf is wrong with you!  \nYou know something, it's not what happens to us that defines us, it's how we react to what happens to us. And you're showing the world right now what kind of person you truly are.", "Huge, massive, glaring YTA!! I get that you're upset at your now ex wife's betrayal but hope on earth is that your daughters fault??? Why is she being punished for her mums infidelity.  Absolutely despicable behaviour and I'm not surprised your mum chewed you out!", "YTA......as is your ex.  However, that poor child should not suffer because you're both assholes.  You are her father, the only one that she knows...donating sperm and egg doesn't make you a parent.......it's a real shame you don't realize that.  I have a cousin, who isn't my uncle's biological child.  His wife cheated, he knew the kid wasn't his but raised it anyway.  Our entire family knew, but the child was never treated differently, this child is my uncle's child, my uncle is the father, and nobody would have it any other way.", "YTA Jesus Christy you raised that child for nine years. To just look her in the face and say you don\u2019t want her is absolutely heartless, how do you sleep at night?", "First of all your ex is an huge asshole. I understand that you're hurt, but who talks to a kid that way. Saying that she's got another father, but it's not you anymore is just cruel. Also in the comments you're trying to diminish her trauma by saying that she's just 9 and won't remember anything. Can't believe you have to even ask this, but YTA.", "Impossible to really judge a situation like this. You can't really help how you feel and probably feel betrayed all over again. You probably need time to process the information.", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. Everyone saying YTA for damaging your (ex?)

I understand you are hurt, but you are destroying that child. You are the adult here. You are the one that should have to deal with the hurt of this situation, not a 9 year old child. Children don\u2019t fully understand the complex context of situations like this, so to her you\u2019ve just decided she isn\u2019t worth being loved by you. Get a therapist. Apologize to that poor little girl. And grow tf up.", "Ok I am not justifying what you did but as much as I can say about what you did it\u2019s not 100 percent your fault. Her mom has a lot of the blame for this situation too. I see a lot of people racking you over the fire but not her.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with them moms blame in this shit show. Mom cheated there is no way she had no idea she may not have been yours. She let you raise a child knowing damn well it wasn\u2019t yours then proceeds to have two more kids with you and cheats some more. Seriously who does this. \n\nMom has destroyed her daughters, your kids life  and your  life with her lies. Not to mention there is a man out there that doesn\u2019t know \nhe has a child. How cruel and heartless can you be. She needs to own up to her part in all this.\n\nWith that being said. Let\u2019s start off with how you told your daughter. I get your hurt. I get you are mad. I get you are a victim of the mothers lies. But you are taking your anger out on the one other victim in this and that is a innocent 9 year old child. \n\nI think a lot of us get on her and say I would not walk away. You raised her for 9 years how could you. And I hope I would do exactly step up. But none of us know how we would react to this kind of betrayal. This is not giving you a free pass at all! I am just playing devils advocate. \n\nBut as bad as you are hurt right now. As confused with your feelings and emotions right now your a grown ass man and can\u2019t proceed this what do you think this 9 year old girl is going through.\n\nHonestly I seen where some one recommended you get therapy. I would definitely do that immediately. Or the anger and resentment is going to affect your children. I would also get your children in therapy too because their mother had burned their life to the ground and dance on the ashes.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about not paying child support. I would suggest talking to a lawyer because truthfully I think your still legally responsible for this child. Is that a screwed up system where a woman can lie and you believe her then be on the Hooke to legally be responsible for the kid? Yes I know I am going to get hate for that but it\u2019s true. The courts will not let you be takin off the birth certificate or child support because they side what is best for the child. \n\nLike I said I don\u2019t agree with what you have done. And I am by no means patting you on your back. And I could not fantom raising a child and just walk away. I honestly think you emotionally disconnected from this child years ago. I don\u2019t think you cared for like a father or like you do for your other children because quite honestly if you loved her you would have never taken the test because the results would not have mater and you would have never risked loosing a child you truly loved.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what would have been more emotionally damaging. Growing up with you in her life treating her differently then the other kids. Because after this let\u2019s face it you would have. Or growing up with out you. But I do know with out a fact the way you spoke to her that dad you did absolutely the maximum damage.\n\n\nI hope your happy because you destroyed a child for no reason. This is not going to benefit you any you will still have to pay child support. You don\u2019t have to take her for visit however when this goes in from of the judge a judge could reduce the time with the other two kids. But child support will remain the same and you will have to pay for the next 9 years.", "ESH, she is worse but you also suspected for 9 years and didn\u2019t do anything and now you know have totally broke that child\u2019s heart.", "Totally YTA\n\nThis kid has known no other father her entire life and you're punishing her for your ex's actions. There are times an adults just sucks it up and does what's right and you failed that test on every level.", "Wow! I am genuinely in tears reading how your 9yo is trying to contact you.\n\nShe must be devastated. \n\nHaving a parent (which you are to her) turn their back on you is like a bereavement.\n\nYTA\n\nI can't even... wow. Simply, wow!", "I know it hurts\u2026 looking at her and knowing that she is evidence of your (ex)wife\u2019s infidelity must break your heart.\n\nYou are currently closing her off to protect your own mental health. I understand. I do. I really, really do.\n\nBut you are the only father she has ever known. To her, you are her sunshine, her protector, her daddy. You are breaking HER heart - for something that is in no way her fault.\n\nI am begging you, on her behalf, take her into your arms and love her as much as she loves you. \n\nShe is as much your daughter as if you and your wife KNOWINGLY used a sperm donor. Think of her bio father that way, and think about how many men KNOWINGLY bring up sperm donors daughters as theirs despite the lack of DNA.\n\nShe loves you, you are her daddy and her heart is broken.\n\nVoting ESH. But you suck less than your STBex", "YTA. You are ridiculously cruel.", "YTA i don't really have words for this, you're awful. your ex is awful. i feel horrible for her.\n\nedit: and stop referring to a child you've raised for 9 years as \"the kid/girl\" you just sound passive-aggressive towards a 9 yr old who did nothing to contribute to your problems.", "You're a little bit an AH and not an AH \n\nNo need to pay child support. Definitely makes sense to be hurt. The YTA part comes in because you have very severely damaged that poor girl's attachment and trust.", "OP's TA. But maybe OP has to be. Nobody can make OP feel what OP doesn't feel. Maybe OPs feelings will change. It sucks for that poor girl. It sucks for OP.\n\nOP is not the father, but he can still be a friend and compassionate parent and role model for the child. Hopefully they can find some common ground for a new relationship.", "What did YOUR DAUGHTER do to deserve this rejection. You are a disgusting piece of s*it. How in hell can you be so cruel?", "YTA, but you knew that. Why did confirmation that she was not yours hit you so hard? That is the question you need to get answered for yourself first. Maybe with counseling or whatever ... \n\nBut you were hers for 9 years. She does not deserve the abandonment - and you know it. So go figure out **why** this hit you so hard that you cannot but crush an innocent 9-year old ....", "This is above reddits paygrade since you very very obviously need some deep therapy here. I understand how your initial feeling about this is, but you also need to realise that the 9yo never ever saw you as anything else than dad, because you never saw her as anything else than your kid. It would be easy to go the YTA route, and i kind of will. But realise its just objective. You first and foremost need therapy. Im rooting for you, and your relationship to Your child.", "YTA. This child asked for nothing. You are her dad, you have always been her dad, and now you've decided she is worthless to you just because she doesn't share your DNA? Do you have ANY idea of the trauma you are inflicting on this innocent child? I don't even want to say you're an asshole. You give assholes a bad name.", "NTA. I can\u2019t call you TA. Your ex-wife is TA for cheating and not revealing there was a chance the child wasn\u2019t yours up front. You\u2019re in an impossible situation where there\u2019s really no winning. It really sucks for the child who has done nothing wrong to lose a father overnight. It would have been nice if you could have found it in your heart to maintain that relationship. However, I can\u2019t rip you apart for not wanting to.", "The situation could have been handled better on both your side and your ex-wife\u2019s. You should have discussed your feelings with her and she should have listened. Then some kind of arrangement could have been made that is less traumatic for the 9 year old. \n\nYou NTA because you don\u2019t want to take care of a kid that\u2019s not yours; but YTA for telling a 9 year old in the way you did. \n\nIt would have been a hard conversation no matter what, but the situation could have been handled better if you and your ex-wife were able to communicate better.", "I'm not going to say you're an AH. I can't imagine what you must be feeling. But do try to think about the little person who loves you and doesn't know you as anything except Dad.", "EHS  Look I get the fact that you were betrayed, that your wife is absolutely awful, the legal says you have no responsibility but really? You just love your children because have your DNA? Get therapy in order to clarify your ideas and don't take a decision that you might regret later.", "So NTA for not wanting to pay child support. You're also NTA for looking at the girl and feeling nothing. You can't help how you feel. Your ex did you very dirty and you're allowed to feel emotions because of that. Where you are TA is how you communicated to the poor child. You just crushed her world without regard. I would try to make things right with her and maintain a relationship. if she ends up finding her bio dad and having a relationship with him? Great.

She should get therapy but I don\u2019t think you should stay in her life. She\u2019s going to know you don\u2019t feel the same.

Don\u2019t cut her off like this. Do you really wanna be the reason she ends up running away, doing drugs\u2026 or worse. Even if you feel hurt, try to act as normal as possible with her, meanwhile let her asshole of a mother explain the situation for her. Let her slowly process what happened.

She was definitely a daddy's girl growing up. The issue is that I always questioned in the back of my head if she was truly mine as my ex has never been loyal but the younger 2 look identical to me. 9yro looks like either of us.\n\nMy ex and I got a divorce 2 months after my youngest was born as the marriage wasn't healthy, she kept being unfaithful but we stayed together for the kids till it got too much.\n\nRecently, something itched me recently to get a paternity test done to see if my worried were correct. A friend suggested it as he pointed out how my 9yro looks nothing like me and that there was only one way to know.\n\nSurprisingly my ex didn't even fight me on this and let me get the test done.

I get the little two in the car and my 9 year old comes out and says she's ready to go to my house. But I couldn't do it. I felt nothing looking at her. I want to spend time with my kids not another person's kid. \n\nSo I told her she isn't coming and I told her that she had a daddy out there but it isn't me anymore. I'm not paying child support for her anymore. Only for the 2 I made. \n\nKid has been sending me messages on her phone (she had it due to living in two homes). She sent me voice messages crying. But honestly it doesn't make me feel anything. She keeps saying \"but your my daddy.\"\n\nI told my mom about the situation as she questioned where the girl was but she blew up in my face and told me I was an asshole for abandoning a child.\n\nBut she isn't my child, and I can't even look at her.
