She calls out sick constantly. Most recently, she called out on a Friday with the excuse that she \"pushed herself too hard this week at work and just can't do it today\". Very unprofessional. Also, our daily activity logs are public so I can see that she disappears around 1PM every day and does literally nothing until it's time to clock out.\n\nShe has used the fact that she has a child to get a custom schedule that allows her to do less work and has a lower monthly quota. Her work volume is significantly less than everyone else who works here, including others who have children so I'm not really understanding why this is allowed.\n\nEvery time there is a difficult task, she says she can't do it because her focus is \"divided\", which means I have to do it instead. Everyone keeps expressing pity for her \"circumstances\" but I honestly don't think it's a valid excuse.  For the record, her child is 10yrs old, is very independent and goes to school full time so I'm not really understanding why this is being treated as some kind of disadvantage. \n\nLast week, she was complaining during a team meeting about how she can't do live chat support in the morning because as a mother, her brain needs more time to \"warm up\" and that it \"doesn't function\" that early in the day. She said that a reasonable accommodation should be made for her well being. \n\nAs a disabled person myself, I could tell she was reading direct quotes from the employee handbook about your rights to workplace accommodations from The Americans with Disabilities Act, which really pissed me off. I didn't appreciate hearing someone try to twist a human rights issue to give herself an easier workload.\n\nI said \"I'm sorry but having a child or not being a morning person does not qualify as a disability so asking for those accommodations is inappropriate and unfair to the rest of us\".\n\nNow, I feel like the whole team is holding a grudge against me for it even though they know it's the truth. My manager agreed with me when we spoke privately but said that she has no idea how to handle that situation.\n\nThe other employees are now following in her footsteps and trying to do less work for ridiculous reasons and calling out sick nonstop. They keep saying ridiculous things like that their \"brain hurts\" or that they \"overpoured their inner cup\" and get excused from their assignments.\n\nAITA for calling her out for trying to use her child as an excuse to be a poor worker and get disability accommodations?\n\nEditing to clarify some things that are being taken out of context -\n\n1. Yes, I do know for a fact that there is NO accommodation in place behind the scenes. This person and I were quite close for a long time. She has explicitly stated that this job is too much for her and that she didn't realize it would be this difficult. \n\n2. If she actually qualified for a workplace accommodation then, this would have been handled privately rather than said awkwardly to a group of co-workers. \n\n3. Also, None of this was said during a formal work meeting. It is a casual zoom call that they keep open all day to gossip. I have to hear them cursing and complaining all day long about how much they hate working here.

I believe the employer is allowed to ask for a doctors note, verifying that this is a required accommodation. It's also the law that only **reasonable** accommodations must be made. If she's taking advantage, feel free to consult with legal.", "NTA - using \"disability\" like this makes that much harder for people who are actually disabled to be taken seriously and get the accommodations they need. It also dilutes what disability is and means. It takes a special kind of entitlement to ask for stuff like this when you don't need it. \n\nIf she really can't do this job with a 10 year old in school full time she needs to find a different job.

Her conduct is impacting you and others on the team in a negative way.  \n\nHer excuses are just that.  If you have a legitimate disability, you're probably not going to say things like your brain needs more time to warm up or that you aren't a morning person.  You can get away with saying those things once in humor, but a functional workplace with people who actually act like adults would consider those comments to be coming from someone lazy and unprofessional.  I don't consider myself a morning person, and sometimes it takes me a while to get going, but you know what, I still get to work on time and put the effort in.  To claim that you need an accommodation for that is just taking a p\\*\\*\\* out of everyone around you.", "NTA.  She shouldn\u2019t get special privileges because she has a child.  Most people have children.  If she took a pay cut so she could have more relaxed hours and a lower quota that\u2019s fair.  Still, she shouldn\u2019t be acting like a child is such an impediment to her life.  Children are difficult, yes, but guess what?  Most people deal with them.  She needs to grow up.  You might get in a bit of trouble with HR for what you said but I would\u2019ve loved to be able to say that to an entitled person.", "NTA, sounds like she\u2019s just lazy and needed a telling off anyway.

Perhaps that will help everyone see your perspective.", "NTA but your manager is.

What I don\u2019t get is this:\n\n>   My manager agreed with me when we spoke privately but that she has no idea how to handle the situation \n\nWell, her not handling this now has caused her to have other goldbrickers on staff, to the detriment of everyone\n\nHow is it that your jobs are peripherally related to HR and you have this problem?!?\n\nYou need to go over your very ineffective manager\u2019s head.", "NTA. It's gross that she's attempting to use the *ADA* to get away with being a crappy employee. I am taking you on your word here that you know for sure that she isn't covered by it. But you have to stop talking with your coworker about this. It's time to get management involved. Create a problem they need to solve, the same way your coworker has.\n\nYou need to focus on you, not on her. \"I have a massive workload that I am unable to hand off because everyone else says their plate is already full.

If they are unable to help with my workload, what tasks can wait and what is a priority. To be clear, I am telling you that I *cannot* complete this work myself. If you can't reassign work then you need to tell me priorities. Put them in writing and I will refer to them.\"\n\nIf *they* bring up your problem coworker: \"Discrimination based on family status is illegal. This means that you can't treat people differently just because they have children. It *also* means that you can't unfairly *disadvantage* someone who does *not* have children. If we have different workloads and are not allowed the same leeway and the only *difference* is that she has a child then you are discriminating against me based on a legally protected category. I would also like to work part days. Can this be arranged with the same agreement that she has?\"\n\nStick to your guns. You cannot make this a *coworker* issue, but you can make this a *workload* issue. Plus, if the managers do nothing? Guess what, you work in a toxic workplace and it's time to find a new job.", "NTA. Why the hell does she get disability accommodations? That's not how it works. She's invalidating those with honest disabilities by pulling this crap. Your manager better get a handle on it otherwise, night owls might start using your very example to pull this.", "This is tough given that you\u2019re really just an individual contributor and not a manager yourself and kinda lashed out before understanding the context.  There could\u2019ve been arrangements you didn\u2019t know about, a lower pay rate or something, but given your manager agreed, you are right about the points you\u2019re making.  But it should be on your manager, and their boss if needed, to handle.  And it seems like the manager should be involving their own boss since they don\u2019t know what to do.  \nNTA but there was a better way to go about this I\u2019m sure", "NTA. That\u2019s annoying as hell. But there seems to be a larger management issue here. Why, if the logs are public, is your boss (who I assume is also your boss) so at a loss about how to address this? Or unwilling to involve someone higher up? This certainly seems like an issue HR should be aware of, particularly if she\u2019s hinting at disability and needing further accomodations.\n\nI\u2019d sit down with your boss and go over the logs/hours/projects you and others are doing versus what she\u2019s doing. If she can\u2019t keep up with others on the team, that\u2019s a performance concern.\n\nAll this being said: I do wonder from the way you describe her if there is something going on with her mental health-wise. Not that this excuses her behavior, but being unable to concentrate and not being able to complete work can certainly be a symptom of that. That *could* be a disability, however, that\u2019s a conversation and judgement that\u2019s beyond your role.\n\nWith this in mind, you could even frame your conversation to your boss from a place of concern: while she may or may not be \u201cdisabled\u201d from a legal standpoint, a leave of absence of some kind could help diffuse tension as well as give her an excuse to rest and/or quit if she really can\u2019t handle the job. Even just having upper management or HR offer her some support could go a long way.\n\nNot trying to be overly sympathetic towards her here, plus you\u2019re not in a supervisor role. Don\u2019t go overboard getting involved. But there\u2019s a compassionate yet firm way to make a case to your boss about why they need to escalate the situation further.\n\nEdit: clarity", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's one thing for you to bring your concerns to your manager, and they respond by acknowledging the issue at hand and telling you that they will work on a solution. This manager is leaving both you and the company open to a lawsuit. For your personal protection, tread carefully. \n\nThe other thing is just because you were once close to the coworker does not mean they old you everything about themselves. I had a coworker I was very close to and now I consider her my BFF. Her 1 year old is my god daughter. Even as close as we were when we worked together, it wasn't until after she left the company that I shared my struggles with my mental health. I have general anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, depression, and ADHD. After 32 years, I have perfected masking. None of my current coworkers know, and there are a few that I consider friends and do spend time with outside of the office. I can tell you, there are days where I do feel like I've overfilled my cup, and my productivity suffers for it. I always make up for it by happily taking on extra projects to help lighten my coworkers' loads though, so its not quite the same. \n\nThe point I'm making is you are NTA, but be careful about the manner in which you discuss your concerns.You don't always have all the facts, and you don't want to find yourself named in a lawsuit if one gets filed in the future for an ADA violation surrounding the unauthorized release of confidential medical information.", "NTA for not seeing her issue as an ADA one, finding her annoying, or not wanting to personally pick up her slack, but if others are following her lead, perhaps you\u2019re all overworked for the pay and should pull back a little. Perhaps your company like many others is understaffed for volume etc. \n\nAre you paid appropriately for the work? Do you all have work/life balance? I would draw boundaries to taking on extra work, sure, but let the managers worry about productivity, unless you have amazing profit sharing or get paid to worry about that. The fact that you mention others are following her lead suggests to me that maybe the job should be more chill than you think (pay to effort). If others are following her lead, why don\u2019t you and drop doing extra to cover?", "You are worrying too much about another coworker. Most of what you know is hearsay. Focus on you and make your day happy. Talk to your manger about expectations and make it clear you work x number of hours doing the job they want. Do not do the workload of others unless asked to by your manager. In writing. Even an as per our conversation email clarifing expectations verbally given. \n\nLet the system fail and let your manager do their job. \n\nSave your sanity as your coworker is clearly trying to save theirs.", "This comment made my day. Thank you LOLOL", "Don\u2019t do the extra work. Can\u2019t you refuse that, set your own boundaries and capacity, and let your manager sort it out?", "this is best advice OP, CYA and refuse to take on their work unless 1) it is required by your manager 2) you can actually take on the extra work within work hours(not extra time)", "Her scripts are actually quite bad."]}
