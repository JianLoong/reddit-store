Are your parents are OK with your sisters and your BIL dumb thinking?  Plus haven't they heard of reviews and getting a walk around the day care? Those days you can find a review on everything and everyone and I'm sure there are reviews of day cares on trusted review places such as trustpilot nit sure about websites for day care reviews. Their thinking makes 0 sense especially their insecurities as most parents look through reviews and do loads of research on a places like day care and ask those places billion questions before signing up for things. \n\nSorry for such long ramble but I don't understand how they think. Anyways you are NTA because you knew your weaknesses and you lack of training and understanding on how to correctly take care of a baby, your sister and BIL should have accepted your no and looked for someone else. Also anything can happen when looking after a baby and if anything happened then the blame would have been put on your and not on them for leaving their baby with you. You did 100% a good thing for saying no to them.

When my kids were little my sister had little ones at home too and was living rent free with my parents. I had a very good job when I got pregnant and my ex worked at Walmart so it was important to keep my job to keep us afloat. But I had the same fear of others caring for my son, besides I couldn\u2019t afford it even on my income. So my folks told my sister that if she was going to keep living there rent free (and job free both her and her shit husband) she had to watch my son for a few hours that my ex and I overlapped shifts. I didn\u2019t ask for it I only told my mom I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. My sister has resented me forever for it. She was amazing with him don\u2019t get me wrong, but now that kiddo is 15 and she\u2019s had my blocked for several years.\n\nIt comes down to whether you are willing to overlook her demanding behavior to salvage your relationship. But no way you can do it long term so their best bet is to find a nanny through an agency.\n\nChild abuse can come from anywhere, including family. They might be strangers but if it\u2019s what they do for a living you can assume that they know more than most family. Big things like first aid, feeding dos and donts etc.", "NTA. Is she also screaming at her in-laws and husband too?", "NTA you owe her nothing. She\u2019s the AH for yelling at you to what? Become her slave? She had the baby, she can deal with it. Not your baby, not your problem. I take that very seriously.", "NTA she needs to use daycare just like everyone else does.", "NTA your sister probably has her hormones all out of control because after having a baby it takes a while (a year) to become more balanced. So hopefully she\u2019ll settle soon but her husband needs to be ok with different options too.", "NTA. She should have worked this out ahead of time. She should not assume family is just ready-made babysitters.

I don\u2019t always get paid, only when they have some money spare. Watching him when he was a baby was stressful, as he\u2019s gotten older? Still stressful but at least there\u2019s no vomiting or milk bottles anymore.\n\nMy sister had him when she was still living at home and I offered to watch him so she could have nights out with her friends and enjoy a break every few weeks or so, and looking after a newborn is terrifying. To this day I still fear that I somehow did something wrong when he was a baby and he\u2019s now over 4 years old. \n\nWhy do I watch my nephew so much? Because both his parents were students in university, one with a job and the other having to do countless hours of unpaid placements. So I knew it was only going to be until they\u2019d graduated that I\u2019d find myself needing to watch him regularly. Whereas your situation sounds a lot more long term. \n\nSo, no, you are not the asshole. Looking after a baby is draining, you deserve to live your own life. Childcare is something they should have planned out before they had the baby. You are not their default nanny just because you\u2019re the aunt (assuming F from situation). Babies are also messy, whiny and can get injured if you turn your back for a few seconds. You deserve to rest between studying for exams.\n\nFrom the sounds of it they also would probably be hounding you constantly about the baby and wouldn\u2019t fully trust the baby with you either. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty about it, if she is mad that you have set a very common and very basic boundary then that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA - so she doesn't trust professional caregivers who have probably cared for more babies then she's ever seen in her entire life but is willing to trust a sibling with no baby experience who doesn't want the job?\n\nYes bad things can happen at daycares.  But I don't think it is nearly as common as made out to be. Most child abuse is perpetrated by family members", "Nta\n\"Now I feel super guilty about it and don\u2019t know how to approach her, I need some advice.\" Her plan is working, you are doubting yourself. Shes being ridiculous", "Nta. Not your baby. Not your problem to find a solution for.\n\nIt's quite telling that no one will nanny for her/them.", "Childcare professionals who are trained to look after infants: not good enough.\nYoung person with neither the skills or inclination to look after an infant: perfect choice for my baby!\n\nNTA. Your sister and her husband need to sort out this problem. Either they spend less money so your one of them can quit their job or they use childcare. You have a life you are living and important things you need to be doing.", "NTA\n\nYou told her no. You're neither obligated or trained to be a nanny", "NTA \nProblem solved", "NTA that baby isn't yours and is not your responsibility to take of. The fact she is basically pawning her child off to everyone else to care for says alot about her. So don't you worry about it.", "My sister is like this, all is great until you disagree with her then she throws everything in your face and guilt trips and manipulates, don't fall for it. Take care of your own life.", "NTA. You're not exactly free, here, you're studying, which means not watching the baby all the time. On top of that, you have zero experience with babies and are scared of doing something wrong. It's not your job to look after her baby.\n\nChildcare should have been figured out before baby was born, not after. She's now got the choice of being a stay at home parent or paying for childcare, no matter her opinions on that. She can't expect you to take care of her baby just because she's too lazy to sort anything else out.", "I\u2019m surprised by the surprise new parents have with what to do with the baby when they have to go back to work. How did you not think about this part.", "Not to mention unreasonable. They would rather a younger sibling with no experience with an infant care for their child rather than people who are trained to do so and do it for a living? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. They should thoroughly vet daycare providers and get references like all normal people would and leave OP alone.", "With how hard it is to find a good daycare these days.. they should have had it figured out BEFORE the baby was ever even conceived.", "That and acting like it's the siblings responsibility to watch their kid. The entitlement of people is astonishing.", "Unreasonable but cheaper.\n\nOp nta.", "Like the moment you find out you're pregnant, is when you look for daycare. Sometimes waitlists are a year or more."]}
