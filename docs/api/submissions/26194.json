She did not take this well. \n\nShe screamed at me this morning when she brought her baby because I asked her if she\u2019d find a daycare. I am so shocked of the words came out of her mouth. She told me that I do not care about her baby and that she doesn\u2019t trust strangers to take care of her baby.

Are your parents are OK with your sisters and your BIL dumb thinking?  Plus haven't they heard of reviews and getting a walk around the day care? Those days you can find a review on everything and everyone and I'm sure there are reviews of day cares on trusted review places such as trustpilot nit sure about websites for day care reviews. Their thinking makes 0 sense especially their insecurities as most parents look through reviews and do loads of research on a places like day care and ask those places billion questions before signing up for things. \n\nSorry for such long ramble but I don't understand how they think. Anyways you are NTA because you knew your weaknesses and you lack of training and understanding on how to correctly take care of a baby, your sister and BIL should have accepted your no and looked for someone else. Also anything can happen when looking after a baby and if anything happened then the blame would have been put on your and not on them for leaving their baby with you.

When my kids were little my sister had little ones at home too and was living rent free with my parents. I had a very good job when I got pregnant and my ex worked at Walmart so it was important to keep my job to keep us afloat. But I had the same fear of others caring for my son, besides I couldn\u2019t afford it even on my income. So my folks told my sister that if she was going to keep living there rent free (and job free both her and her shit husband) she had to watch my son for a few hours that my ex and I overlapped shifts. I didn\u2019t ask for it I only told my mom I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. My sister has resented me forever for it. She was amazing with him don\u2019t get me wrong, but now that kiddo is 15 and she\u2019s had my blocked for several years.\n\nIt comes down to whether you are willing to overlook her demanding behavior to salvage your relationship. But no way you can do it long term so their best bet is to find a nanny through an agency.\n\nChild abuse can come from anywhere, including family. They might be strangers but if it\u2019s what they do for a living you can assume that they know more than most family. Big things like first aid, feeding dos and donts etc.", "NTA. Is she also screaming at her in-laws and husband too?", "NTA you owe her nothing. She\u2019s the AH for yelling at you to what? Become her slave? She had the baby, she can deal with it. Not your baby, not your problem. I take that very seriously.", "NTA she needs to use daycare just like everyone else does.", "NTA your sister probably has her hormones all out of control because after having a baby it takes a while (a year) to become more balanced. So hopefully she\u2019ll settle soon but her husband needs to be ok with different options too.", "NTA. She should have worked this out ahead of time. She should not assume family is just ready-made babysitters.

I don\u2019t always get paid, only when they have some money spare. Watching him when he was a baby was stressful, as he\u2019s gotten older? Still stressful but at least there\u2019s no vomiting or milk bottles anymore.\n\nMy sister had him when she was still living at home and I offered to watch him so she could have nights out with her friends and enjoy a break every few weeks or so, and looking after a newborn is terrifying. To this day I still fear that I somehow did something wrong when he was a baby and he\u2019s now over 4 years old. \n\nWhy do I watch my nephew so much? Because both his parents were students in university, one with a job and the other having to do countless hours of unpaid placements. So I knew it was only going to be until they\u2019d graduated that I\u2019d find myself needing to watch him regularly. Whereas your situation sounds a lot more long term. \n\nSo, no, you are not the asshole. Looking after a baby is draining, you deserve to live your own life. Childcare is something they should have planned out before they had the baby. You are not their default nanny just because you\u2019re the aunt (assuming F from situation).

The hormonal imbalance we experience post partum is very real. It can make one feel like not themselves and combine that with no sleep, it\u2019s really a recipe for disaster. I would stand strong on your decision to not be their nanny but maybe take into consideration she is probably going through some stuff too. Again, not excusing it, child rearing is no one\u2019s responsibility but the parents and they should have discussed this beforehand, but there could be more to it. I hope you guys find some resolve.
