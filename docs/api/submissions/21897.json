What do you and this dude have in common besides sex and him getting to act like a big, mature guy? He's with you because you're too young to know better. Run.", "You're focusing on the wrong thing here. Until you arrived, your boyfriend was alone with his toddler daughter high as a kite on benzos and alcohol (can be a lethal combination). He's not fit to be taking care of the child.\n\nDo you know the child's mother? Can you contact her? How often is his daughter with him? This is clear neglect. If you can't get in contact with the mother, you'll need to contact social services/child services.\n\nYou also need to get away from him, OP. He's almost twice your age and clearly taking advantage of you. He's abusing one of the worst drugs that can be abused. Benzodiazepines are highly addictive and notoriously difficult to quit. Adding alcohol into the mix is adding fuel to the fire and is actually quite dangerous. He's bad news. You don't need this in your life.", "He\u2019s nearly twice your age, gets zonked out of his mind while watching his toddler and then leaves said toddler with someone he\u2019s only recently started dating.\n\nGirl, you are too young to be involved in this mess.

This will be nothing but a high-drama mindf*ck fest. \n\nEnjoy your youth and go have fun with men who have their ish together.", "Oh hon, find your self respect and leave\n\nNTA but you\u2019re in for nothing but misery if you continue to date him.", "NTA\n\nThis man is 16 years your senior and behaving this way.

The whole situation is fucked. \n\nHe is 37 and that's how he behaves...yikes. I think it would be very wise to become unexclusive with this guy. In fact just tell him to lose your number all together. \n\nNTA.", "Girl why are you dealing with this? The age difference alone is a red flag and his behavior is unacceptable. Dump him!!", "NTA there is MANY problems here.  It will only get worse \n\nFor one, who the fuck invited their brand new partner over while obliterated?\n\nFor two, who the fuck does he think he is snatching your phone. The disrespect is HIGH and it\u2019s a new relationship?

As he can't be getting hammered while he's supposed to be caring for his daughter, that's not to mention the drunk driving. The thought of him getting in the car like that with his little girl, is absolutely terrifying.", "Nta this is huge red flag. Your guy age gap is too much for my comfortable. I think he want to test if you suit for babysitting his child or not so he can ask you to move in with him to be live in maid babysitter and bed partner for free. Run while you can you still young don't waste your time with him.", "\"something doesn't seem right here\" \n\nLmao no shit. Where to start? Large age gap with a young woman, drunk and high while caring for his kid, not respecting boundaries, (driving?) to go get food while hammered, asking you to do child minding on DAY ONE of the relationship...\n\nHoney this isn't going to get better. Dump his ass.", "NTA. Run from him. I lost count of all the red flags here.\nFYI, if your relationship has now hit this point, more of this will be forthcoming.

I was excited to see him as we had just recently begun dating.\r  \n\r  \nI got there and I noticed he was behaving strangely. Then, moments later it became clear to me he was barred out and also, very, very drunk (his admission). He was stumbling all over the place making a fool of himself and slurring every time he talked. I had to help him from falling several times. He was not listening to anything I was saying. I also had the added \"bonus\" of having to look out for his daughter.\r  \n\r  \nLater, he got so handsy and touchy and snatched my phone right out of my hands as I was texting someone important. I was shocked he would do something like that and I felt embarrassed and my feelings were hurt.\r  \n\r  \nThen he left me home alone with her while he was out getting us food, which I thought wasn't smart at all but he wasn't listening to me. I felt lowkey uncomfortable watching his kid by myself as he and I had just started exclusively dating that day.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for getting upset at my boyfriend for being drunk and high of Klonopin and being forced to care for his kid? I normally wouldn't mind but something doesn't seem right here.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

FFS, this is a child death waiting to happen.", "NTA - Nothing seems right here. Everything feels quite dysfunctional and wrong. He chose to get to this poor state of mind while he was responsible for his baby, a 3 yrs old. If you had not arrived this kid would be in his obliterated presence. This is incredibly negligent and potentially dangerous\n\nPerhaps he asked you over so go watch his kid since he was trashed. Then he insists on securing food which makes no sense. Are you a safe and free baby sitting service? Have you asked him to explain what occurred; assuming time has past and he's sober?", "NTA\nthere are so many red flags here OP. He\u2019s way too old, alcoholic and possible druggy? And that\u2019s neglect. What if you hadn\u2019t been there? He\u2019s putting his daughter in danger AND you", "NTA. Don\u2019t stay with this irresponsible old man and please contact CPS. He is a danger to that toddler and she clearly should not be left in his care. He is stumbling around drunk and high. He could easily hurt his daughter. Toddlers are always getting under foot. There are so many possibilities in how she could get hurt. She could accidentally get into his stash and OD. He could OD in front of her. He could behave erratically towards her and neglect her care. I mean he already is. You should never have had to watch this man\u2019s daughter because he was so out of it and behaving erratically. A little girl isn\u2019t going to understand why he is behaving that way, it\u2019s going to scare her. Ideally get him to confess to being high and drunk while watching his kid via text and then turn it over to the authorities. Then yeet that man into the sun and don\u2019t look back.", "Uhhh NTA. Get the fuck away from this loser. His daughter needs to be in child services", "Definitely NTA this guy sounds like an absolutely catastrophe, poor kid.

Someone who's 21 is definitely old enough to see this for the parade of red banners that it is if she just thinks about it fur more than 5 minutes", "He confessed to me he had a DUI.
