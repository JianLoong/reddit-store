If he just blurted this out in the middle of a get together, I would think that's kind of an asshole thing to just throw out there about someone, but it seems like the perfect answer to the question asked if he wasn't aware he wasn't supposed to talk about it.", "YTA no one, and I mean no one, short of a stalker, is paying as much attention to you as you think they are. No it would not be obvious to anyone that the necklace was secret or even that it always stayed under your shirt. The fact that he noticed you always wear is already a pretty big observation.

Wearing something under your clothes means nothing.", "YTA, your partner is not a mind reader. How were they to know you kept that secret?", "Yta, how would he know you keep it secret?

That being said, I also feel that you BF too is in the wrong for bringing up the topic of religion during a GAME!
