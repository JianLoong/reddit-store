Adults can still be parentified, it just is a bit different in how it affects someone. Like a 14 year old is going to have different experiences with parentification than someone who is 22 and being parentified just because they are at different stages in life. A 14 year old could be missing out on childhood and a 22 year old could be struggling with going out to live their own life because they worry the younger siblings may not be cared for if they leave.\n\nHell, you can be an only child and be parentified as well. Say your parents fight a lot, then after those fights your mom or dad will talk about it with you. They\u2019ll tell you all their heavy feelings, you\u2019ll feel the need to comfort them, maybe give advice. That\u2019s parentification too, it is putting the \u201cchild\u201d (minor or adult) in a position where they are taking care of the emotional needs of their parents. It\u2019s especially bad if the parents don\u2019t take care of the child\u2019s emotional needs and well-being. Personally I experienced this kind, I\u2019m the youngest in my family and spent so much time constantly worrying about my parents emotional well-being and taking care of theirs while mine was ignored. If I showed big emotions, or any other than happy, it was an issue and I learned that showing emotion wasn\u2019t okay for me specifically. I never had to take care of younger siblings, I had to take care of my parents emotions and be responsible for them. Both kinds of situations count as parentification, they just happen differently.
