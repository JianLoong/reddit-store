If i remember correctly this is called parentification, but I dont know if that counts once youre over 18.\n\nEither way, you didnt choose to have a child, you are not responsible in any way, shape or form to raise her.\n\nHelping out when youre needed sometimes is a good and normal thing to do. But you should be focusing on yourself and tell your mum out right that shes her daughter and her responsibility, you cant work, go to school and raise a sibling", "YWNBTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're 19, live your life, make your money, do your studies. Your baby sister is not your child or your responsibility, its a great thing that you dedicated so much time whilst your mum was recovering and you should be proud of that BUT your mum shouldn't allow that to now be the normal. \n\nIn the nicest way, you are still some what of a kid too at 19 and you shouldn't feel guilty for not wanting to be acting mum of your baby sister.", "NTA\n\nFrom what you have written, it sounds like you are being taken advantage of and taken for granted. It's a tough world out there and it's lovely that your mother had you to rely on while she was in hospital, but now she is better she should be looking after the child that it is her responsibility to look after.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour parents chose to have a large family, it's on them to care for their kids. Of course, family help family when needed such as recovery from surgery etc. But this seems far far more than that.\n\nThe surgery recovery period is done now. Longer term, it's not ok for your mum to hand over shower the entirety of parenting for your youngest sibling to you. Parentification is the term I see used to describe this. If she didn't want to care for them she should not have had them. \n\nI would have a conversation before simply stopping cold turkey and warn your mum that she will need to make other arrangements by X date (keeping this to a short notice period) at which time you'll be handing those responsibilities back to her, where they belong. This in order to ensure there no neglect in care from your siblings' perspective.\n\nThat said, I assume you are living with your parents, and they are therefore financially providing you with accommodation, food, toiletries and so on. \n\nYou may need to compromise and either agree to a fixed limited amount of care for your sibling in exchange for all of that. Or that you contribute appropriately financially to the household instead.\n\nWishing you best!", "YWNBTA at all. I find it completely baffling when people have kids and are constantly trying to palm them off onto somebody else. Like, why have them if you don't want to look after them? Anyway, I think it's time to have another talk with your mum. Is the the kind of person to pull the \"If you're living under my roof, you'll do as I say\" card?", "YWNBTA. You have a job and are getting ready for school starting. You do not have time to be the primary care-giver to anyone. Especially someone else who has a dedicated primary care-giver, that person's mother. Who, from you reply to a comment, is a SAHM.\n\nAnd you offered to help when able. You have been a good big-sister and a good daughter. Now focus on your life.", "Nta not your kid not your responsibility", "Parentification, plain and simple", "Is your father in the picture?", "NTA.\n\nWhen talking to your mom about this, focus on the fact that your job and school will take up too much time and you want to focus on school now. Even though it's not OK your mom 'gave up', mentioning this is a confrontation you can probably avoid. She might just be going through a mental dip after being inactive for a while, picking up the slack might actually make her feel better.", "INFO: You're an adult. Why don't you move out?", "NTA.

Mention your willingness to help when able. Sounds like your mom just needs a little push to get back into her daughter's life and free you up to live yours.", "NTA. Time to spread your wings and act like someone who doesn't have a kid. That's your mom's job not yours", "thanks for your comment and i really like your idea.\nas of right now, we are on vacation and i'm left in the hotel taking care of my siblings while my parents are going out and exploring, i really think it's gotten out of hand. its like they brought me to travel with them as a maid, not as their daughter. i'm considering telling her i will be stopping taking care of my sister around the time my summer ends since i really wont have free time anymore. i don't think she'll try to use the surgery card since we both know it's been so long since she had it and its fully healed right now. i have nothing against my mother and i am always glad to help but i seriously think this is too much now.", "not really, shes not that type of person, I just think she believes I have all the free time in the world so she just gives my sister to me.", "Well said.", "yes, but he has a full-time job and rarely has time to spend with us, but I don't blame him since he works really hard for all of us. my mom however is a stay at home mom", "that's not how things go where I'm from, I stay in the house with my family until I get married.", "I'm so sorry they are treating you like an unpaid maid through the vacation. Can you talk to them about that now and request that you go out and do activities together, sharing the care for THEIR child?", "Where you're from, are you expected to help with the house and family until you're married?\n\nWhat are the cultural expectations?", "i actually just talked to my mother, she just said she'll be taking my sister for the rest of the day so I feel like she'll be pretty open to the conversation later on", "yes but to some extent, mothers are expected to \"teach\" their daughters these life skills: how to cook and things to know about raising kids and stuff like that but not completely raising a kid.", "What percentage of support do your parents currently provide you? Do they pay for your housing? Food? Education? Transport? Vacations? Clothing? Entertainment? etc? Or do you pay for these things?\n\nI don't need you to answer. But if the answer is they pay for everything it's something quite different then you paying for a large percentage of your expenses.\n\nIf you choose not to contribute to the household by providing childcare, what would you contribute instead? You mentioned getting a job. Would you be willing to contribute your earnings from your job?", "my education is free, and housing/vacations are paid for by my father. anything personal to me like food and clothing is paid for by me, most of the time I pay for food for my siblings as well. I am extremely thankful to my family for providing things like that for me and I know I am extremely lucky, but since university is starting up soon and I just recently started my job, it would be really difficult to manage all of that including having to care for my sister.", "Can't you live on campus or at least get up early to go study elsewhere most of the day?", "NTA. I recommend studying/ doing homework at the library so your schoolwork is not interrupted by your mom's demands! Absolutely fine for you to help out a reasonable amount like any household member but getting out of the house will be key.", "NTA\n\nPlease google 'parentification'. It is considered a form of abuse for a parent to force an older child to raise a younger sibling. If you can, please look into moving out. It's often the only thing that will prevent a parent from foisting their child off on you (and even then, it doesn't always work). The guilt you feel has been manufactured by your mother to keep you subserviant and doing her job for her. Try to shake it off. This is *not* your responsibility and you have *nothing* to feel guilty for. Don't let your mother ruin your future by stealing these years from you.", "The family relationships are the same, OP is at home, and she's been roped into lots of care for a while. 18 is not a magical transformation. The parentification continues and is now literal.\nIt was not so bad when it was pitching in occasionally, and it helps that OP likes caring. It even was tolerable after surgery when OP has the time. But now she needs her time to be hers and Mom has admitted that she has checked out", "Even though it's not OK your mom 'gave up', mentioning this is a confrontation you can probably avoid.

They provide bare minimum they're obligated to do by the law. Actually you have zero reason to be thankful. You're not lucky, you're exploited, and fuck the culture (I come from the similar culture, I can say this), no one should live like this.\n\nIt's 21 century. Get out. If you won't pay for the food of your parents kids, you'll probably be able to rent. Or move with the studies to another city to get a housing through your school, if you have this system.", "it\u2019s not the bare minimum im actually getting pretty spoiled by my parents with extremely expensive things (it\u2019s the normal lifestyle here) i just started paying for these things because i feel bad having my parents pay for everything especially since i make my own money now. (my mom gets her own money from other sources like investments and such and my father works full time) but they usually won\u2019t let me pay if they knew i paid for these things (i just don\u2019t tell them so they don\u2019t have to feel like they\u2019re not doing enough)"]}
