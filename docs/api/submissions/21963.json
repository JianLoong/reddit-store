I drove back, and saw she was still unable pick him up. I gave her an ultimatum that she learns how to help him up right now without my help, because what would happen if I was hours away?

Leaving your elderly and vulnerable dad in the floor so you can give baby sis an education in how to leave you alone to party? Nope.\n\nYou need to do some soul searching and see about either getting them help so you don't have to do it, or taking some responsibility.", "YTA. \n\nYou are 35 and out partying instead of being helpful in the home you choose to live in? When does your sister get to see friends, be social, have hobbies etc? It's tiring to have to help your father? Seriously? \n\nYou need to help at home. There are tasks your sister will need assistance with and you should do it for your father as well. She is on the spectrum and doing the best she can and won't be able to do all of the physical tasks.", "YTA your sister is a decade and a half younger than you with autism. You should be helping her to take care of *your* father.", "He needs to be in elder housing that can deal with his basic care\n\nShe should find a group with people like herself where maybe she can make friends.\n\nYTA that should live alone, as apparently you're the only one that matters", "YTA. Hard one. I did not seen such selfish and self centered bully as you for a Long time. Did even cross your mind that she  may not even have strenght to lift him up? You were Just awful to her and obviously, your partying is more important for u than your sister and your dad. Awfull.", "You definitely are TA also you don\u2019t seem like you care about your dad at all", "YTA\n\nShe probably doesn't have as much muscle strength as you, and it's unfair to expect her to lift him by herself. \n\nI suggest you  cut down on your partying and step up on sharing the work of caring for your father. That or arrange for a home health aide to come by daily to help your sister.", "YTA  Double triple quadruple\n\nHopefully this isnt real \n\nIf it is YOU are commiting elder abuse by leaving your father with someone incapable of properly caring for him.  Doesnt matter why she is incapable.  \n\nWhy are you even living there is you are unwilling to help?  Hopefully you are not mooching off him for a place to live.  It is very very difficult to get people up when they have fallen down, you are probably able to do so because you are physically stronger .\n\nYiu need to put your father in a home where he can get the medical care he needs and deserves.

Your sister made that choice in theory and now it's failing in practice. It's not working, and you know it isn't working. You aren't ignorant, so you aren't innocent.\n\nYou can see that your sister isn't capable, but dealing with it would be inconvenient so you are pretending your sister is the only one in the wrong.

It\u2019s very dangerous to leave your dad with someone who wouldn\u2019t call 911 in an emergency!

I can't be reading this right. Are you incompetent somehow? \n\nYour father does not deserve to be abused because you are unable to recognize everyone's limitations.
