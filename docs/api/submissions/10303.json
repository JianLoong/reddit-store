He was my first boyfriend ever and he showed me care I've never received from a man before. Long story short, I've left him after almost 10 years of being together, because I started questioning *why* I've fallen in love with him. I had an emotionally abusive father growing up and I never went to therapy and never tried to process that. I just tucked it away and got married to a man, who was the complete opposite of him and a people pleaser.\n\nUpon leaving my husband, I moved back in with my mother (father is dead now) and my little brother and now I hate my life and miss my husband terribly. I have to commute 3 hours a day to work and my mother and brother are much more difficult roommates than my husband was. My brother especially is frustrated by my presence and constantly picks up fights. \n\nYesterday he was yelling at me through the door about taking too long in the bathroom and I told him to calm down and don't be such an asshole. He asked when will I finally move out, because I'm always in the way and told me I was an idiot for leaving my husband and I should go and beg him to take me back, but he probably won't, because I'm impossible to live with.\n\nI snapped and I yelled at him asking him to have some fucking emphaty for me, I'm going through a hard time and I really don't need him to be such an asshole to me. He replied that it's not his problem, I created this situation for myself and it's not fair that he has to suffer the consequences of my actions too and I don't deserve his empathy.\n\nHe is right that it's all my fault, I created this situation, I only got myself to blame. AITA for yelling at him?\n\n\nEdit for info:\n\nMy brother is 22 and his problem is basically just me being there. Not that I'm messy, or loud, just that I'm present. He likes to send our mother away for the night to her boyfriend when he wants to have company over and it really bothers him that he can't really send me away like that. \n\nAlso, I didn't leave my husband for the other guy, I stopped talking to that man as soon as I realized I have a crush.

I also grew up in an abusive household and end up marrying the first person to show me any sort of kindness and respect. People without childhood trauma don't get just how difficult basic human relationships can be when you enter adulthood. I wasn't mature enough to realize there is alot more to compatibility than the bare minimum of not abusing your partner. The older I got and more maturity I gained, more I realized something was missing. I would also get the grass is greener syndrome when seeing other couples or get innocent little crushes. Needless to say after 10 years and lots of individual and couples therapy, we wised up and divorced. Did I create this situation myself and hurt him? Yes. Was it my responsibility to own up to my faults and heal my traumas? Yes. Was divorce the right call? Yes. Did I miss him alot early on even though I knew it was the right call? Also yes. \n\nI think it'd be smart to go to therapy and to make it a priority to figure out an alternative living situation as soon as reasonably, possible. \n\nSometimes we're the villains in someone else's story (or our own) and we're giant messes, but that doesn't mean you aren't deserving of empathy or understanding, either.", "[deleted]", "YTA, your brother is right.", "you sound very immature. i think that you\u2019d benefit a lot from therapy", "Ok I am going to be really harsh here.

We all subconsciously pick a partner that either is the exact opposite of our abusive parent, or (in my case) the same as our abusive parent to win love from someone we couldn\u2019t win it from as a child. But it definitely influences who we choose to love, don\u2019t get freaked out by that aspect of it. It\u2019s natural. \n\n2) You don\u2019t have to leave your relationship while you navigate this in therapy. You can stand on your own, in your relationship. That\u2019s actually the healthiest goal. I get wanting to leave so you can define yourself more clearly, but this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the wrong person for you and you may not want to lose them forever over this.

Listen to yourself. Ask yourself what's missing? What do you think you need? (Which...I think we're terrible at knowing what it is we really need, but).

Being unlovable or unworthy? Of being judged.... And on and on. (All the lies our brains tell us). If you can see a therapist it might be very beneficial. And either way, pull the brakes.

So often, people's reactions to stuff like this resort to CHEATING=BAD and like, for the most part, sure (dishonesty is usually bad, and cheating is an extreme form of dishonesty and breaking trust), but you didn't cheat. You had feelings, like all humans do, and felt the need to question your marriage. Which makes sense.\n\nUnrelated, but the same thing happened to me when I was engaged. I had a crush, didn't act on it, but told my fianc\u00e9 what I was going through, and we had one of the toughest conversations we'd ever had as a result. We ended up staying together and even admitting that we might both be a little polyamorous (although we haven't actually dated any people outside our marriage).

The brother is beimg purposefully hurtful", "[removed]", "Or rather... \"I may have made a mistake, which I'm trying to process to decide on the way forward, and while I was hoping for family support, I'm getting abuse from my perfectly adult brother - who by the way still lives with our mum\".\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You can miss someone and still be better off not being in a relationship with them. From OPs other comments, husband has a bunch of issues of his own and has been unwilling to address the issues in their relationship. She\u2019s doing the right thing by taking some space to think about what she wants.", "This getting downvoted is a clear sign you're totally right.", "Exactly! There's nothing wrong with ending a relationship even if the other party isn't abusive. The brother is an ass for basically terrorising everyone so he can get his way. OP did nothing wrong. NTA", "They mean that there isn't enough information to assume that the husband is abusive. Because AITA loves bashing husbands for no good reason", "I think OP just didn't leave her husband because she had a crush on another man, i think it was more than a crust perhaps, perhaps she acted out \non the crush, because she could have just gone back to her husband who she misses a lot.", "Sons learn from their father. Father is abusive. Given the limited information, it doesn't seem like a far reach at all.", "It\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s going on here after she\u2019s explained in the comments so I\u2019m not sure why people are so confused", "...and daughters learn from their mothers and sons learn from their mothers and daughters learn from their fathers. If OP recognized the abuse there isn't any reason to assume her brother is modeling behavior after his father as opposed to just being a run of the mill self centered jerk who isn't used to having \"his\" space occupied", "Brushing her issues aside and insisting his were the only valid ones? Did you even read her comments?", "Being unhappy is not neutral.", "She's 5 years older than him and only just recognized it. It wasn't until I was mid 20s I recognized how much of an abusive ass hole my father was. Sometimes you need to step back from a situation for a few years before you can see things clearly. If your trying to argue that parents don't have an influence on their kids behavior i think you're going to have a very uphill battle.", "Not necessarily my ex husband was a people pleaser. He made a great friend and boyfriend but a losy husband because once he \"got\" me and thought I was \"stuck\" with him he walked all over me in order to please other people. \n\nFor instance, we had the party house and on the rare occasion I got the house to myself I liked to get a bottle of wine and deep clean one of the rooms. I would pull rverything out of the room top to bottm and scrub all the furniture before moving it back to the room. My exhusband wasn't capable of telling people no so he would tell to go right over. They wouldn't even bother to knock. They would literally just walk right inn sit in the middle of the room I was trying to clean, and make themselves right at home including changing the television channel I was watching. Of couse when I put my foot down and said no I was the bitch. \n\nBeing married to people pleasers sucks so bad. They will let people walk over you and if you try and set boundaries at all you will always be framed as the bad guy. Also when you leave everyone sees you as being the big meanie for hurting such a nice person.", "Haha I used to be a people pleaser myself and we can still absolutely be an AH. It's thanks to my current partner that I don't still let people walk all over me and put myself and my family (partner and children) 1st. No one's perfect and some psychological issues can run bloody deep."]}
