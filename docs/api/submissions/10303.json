I left my husband 2 months ago and I've been miserable since. I left him, because I had a crush on another man and that made me question our entire relationship and myself too.\n\nI started dating my husband when I was 17 and I fell in love with his kindness. He was my first boyfriend ever and he showed me care I've never received from a man before. Long story short, I've left him after almost 10 years of being together, because I started questioning *why* I've fallen in love with him. I had an emotionally abusive father growing up and I never went to therapy and never tried to process that. I just tucked it away and got married to a man, who was the complete opposite of him and a people pleaser.\n\nUpon leaving my husband, I moved back in with my mother (father is dead now) and my little brother and now I hate my life and miss my husband terribly. I have to commute 3 hours a day to work and my mother and brother are much more difficult roommates than my husband was. My brother especially is frustrated by my presence and constantly picks up fights. \n\nYesterday he was yelling at me through the door about taking too long in the bathroom and I told him to calm down and don't be such an asshole. He asked when will I finally move out, because I'm always in the way and told me I was an idiot for leaving my husband and I should go and beg him to take me back, but he probably won't, because I'm impossible to live with.\n\nI snapped and I yelled at him asking him to have some fucking emphaty for me, I'm going through a hard time and I really don't need him to be such an asshole to me. He replied that it's not his problem, I created this situation for myself and it's not fair that he has to suffer the consequences of my actions too and I don't deserve his empathy.\n\nHe is right that it's all my fault, I created this situation, I only got myself to blame. AITA for yelling at him?\n\n\nEdit for info:\n\nMy brother is 22 and his problem is basically just me being there. Not that I'm messy, or loud, just that I'm present. He likes to send our mother away for the night to her boyfriend when he wants to have company over and it really bothers him that he can't really send me away like that. \n\nAlso, I didn't leave my husband for the other guy, I stopped talking to that man as soon as I realized I have a crush.

I also grew up in an abusive household and end up marrying the first person to show me any sort of kindness and respect. People without childhood trauma don't get just how difficult basic human relationships can be when you enter adulthood. I wasn't mature enough to realize there is alot more to compatibility than the bare minimum of not abusing your partner. The older I got and more maturity I gained, more I realized something was missing. I would also get the grass is greener syndrome when seeing other couples or get innocent little crushes. Needless to say after 10 years and lots of individual and couples therapy, we wised up and divorced. Did I create this situation myself and hurt him? Yes. Was it my responsibility to own up to my faults and heal my traumas? Yes. Was divorce the right call? Yes. Did I miss him alot early on even though I knew it was the right call? Also yes. \n\nI think it'd be smart to go to therapy and to make it a priority to figure out an alternative living situation as soon as reasonably, possible. \n\nSometimes we're the villains in someone else's story (or our own) and we're giant messes, but that doesn't mean you aren't deserving of empathy or understanding, either.", "You just admitted he's right, it's all your fault, you created this situation, and you only have yourself to blame.

We all subconsciously pick a partner that either is the exact opposite of our abusive parent, or (in my case) the same as our abusive parent to win love from someone we couldn\u2019t win it from as a child. But it definitely influences who we choose to love, don\u2019t get freaked out by that aspect of it. It\u2019s natural. \n\n2) You don\u2019t have to leave your relationship while you navigate this in therapy. You can stand on your own, in your relationship. That\u2019s actually the healthiest goal.

This is just coming from a kind internet stranger who has been in a similar position. Think how it would make you feel to be in your husband's position right now. Your marriage means so little to you that you discarded the moment you had a shred of doubt. Even the happiest couples doubt each other at times. That's why relationships are work.\n\nWhy not just be honest with your husband tell him exactly how you're feeling? See what he says? Try couples counseling? Or maybe agree to a trial separation while you each seek individual therapy? \n\nYou're not TA for examining your feelings, *but you are 100% TA for making a unilateral decision that affects two people*.

So I proposed I move out and we try to figure things out separately. He didn't like the idea, so no, it wasn't a mutual decision.\n\nEdit: I also suggested couple's therapy multiple times, but he didn't want that, he said he only needs individual therapy, because it's only his personal problems that are causing trouble - which I don't agree with.", "It\u2019s so easy to sit there and judge her, isn\u2019t it? But then I read her other comments and realize she had suggested couple therapy and he refused, which made me an asshole for judging her.

That's cool you don't have to agree on everything. In what world though is straight up leaving a decade long marriage a better idea than getting any type of therapy though? Now you're 100% solo and you don't have a therapist fixing your issues. Would that compromise have killed you?", "That's \n\nThat's completely different from you described in the post.", "I didn't see the couple's therapy comment earlier, so that actually shifts my perspective. I see your point. \n\nOf course she's entitled to her own choices, but I'll maintain that making a unilateral decision that affects two people is AH behavior. You owe it to each other to try first. However, if she made the effort and he won't cooperate, then I wouldn't call it a unilateral decision anymore.", "I'm a mess. It felt like a good idea back when I made the decision, but now I'm questioning even that. I really miss my husband and in one moment, I feel like this is what I have to do and in another, I feel like an idiot.", "Only quibble: she states that she is seeing a therapist. \n\nNot disagreeing, though", "Hey. It is totally to miss your ex in a breakup and feel totally divided in whether you did the right thing. \n\n\nIt sounds like your ex had a lot of baggage and wasn\u2019t interested in also shouldering any of yours, while you made efforts to help him with his. That makes for an emotionally lopsided relationship, which IS a good reason to end it and especially if your partner refuses to talk it out either in couples therapy or even just with you.\n\n\nRemember, breaks up are fucking hard. It\u2019s why so many people stay in broken relationships well past their expiration date. It\u2019s normal to long for even the imperfect state of your relationship because it\u2019s easier than coping with the break up. But that doesn\u2019t make the relationship better than doing the hard work on yourself and on recovering from a break up and mourning the death of a 10 year relationship. \n\n\nIMO, get out of your mother\u2019s house. It\u2019s not a safe space for you and it will make recovery harder. You\u2019re almost better off with a stranger as a roommate (so long as the stranger respects your space), then you are with your brother\u2019s hostility and your mother\u2019s passivity. Don\u2019t let them drag you deeper into the muck.\n\n\nNTA."]}
