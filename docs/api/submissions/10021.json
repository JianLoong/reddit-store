Your wedding, your way. \n\nWe skipped all the traditional stuff too, just wanted a nice day to share with a small group of family and friends.

Everyone has \u201cvision\u201d for what a proper wedding ceremony looks like. Your vision does not match your mother\u2019s. Explain it to her with all the details & why it\u2019s so important for you. If she truly wants to participate, she needs to start by helping you achieve your goals for your day. It\u2019s the greatest gift all parents can give their children on their wedding day. \n\nIf there\u2019s a place she can help you, AND you trust her to not go off the rails, let her take that off your plate. Boutonni\u00e8res, your bouquet, flowers for centerpieces will not change anything about your day. If you\u2019re willing... AND she can be trusted to follow directions. Let her. Most parents just want what\u2019s best for the children, sometimes it\u2019s a tough pill to swallow when their kids don\u2019t want their input.\n\neta \u2014 weddings are about 2 people. Your vision is the only thing that truly matters. However, your wedding day is about celebrating together with all the people who love & support the both of you. Whoever is paying, is the host for your event, so providing for your guests should be included in your plan. Allowing other people to take control your event, is not part of the plan.", "NTA Your mother (I'm sure) had her wedding she needs to let you have yours. Stick to your guns.", "They are all just making it about themselves, when it's really about you and your husband.\n\nYou already changed plans once, you shouldn't need to change again.\n\nMaybe drill it into their heads that any changes would make you and your husband very unhappy, maybe to the point that you and him will end up cancelling the venue, caterers, etc and make separate arrangements to get married (just the two of you) and not show up to anything that THEY'VE wanted all along.\n\nOr perhaps, if they don't step back, they would not be able to enjoy being present at the wedding at all.", "NTA, this is YOUR wedding. I understand that your mother wants to be involved, but she shouldn't make this about what she wants. You already changed your plans by having a ceremony and small reception instead of eloping. You do you.", "NTA - I had similar issues with my MIL. My advice is just expect your mom to try to get one past you. Don't let it ruin your day. \n\nYou might have your fiance mention to his mom that your mom might be planning some undesired surprises so that she is aware & doesn't get caught up in it. Set expectations with staff - so they'll know  if a cake appears, have staff immediately slice it up to serve so you don't get pressured into \"cutting the cake\" with your hubs if you don't want to. & even if you happen to notice surprise cake, just let it go. It's your day. Enjoy it. \n\nI had a surprise guest & surprise wedding decor with my MIL. I ignored all 3 & had a great day. When the venue's planner came to me about it, I pointed to MIL & asked them to tell MIL what she owed them. (Venue charged per person & tacked on cleaning fees for outside decor. MIL owed them $250!)", "NTA - is she maybe trying to live vicariously through you? Maybe you need to sit her down and explain what your perfect wedding looks like to you and ask her how she can help you have YOUR perfect day and not her perfect day.

There's literally no way to choose food, flowers, outfits to match every single guests personal preferences. A reception does give your guests a chance to celebrate vs. an elopement. But again, even if you bowed down and did it your mom's vision, it's not going to align with your partners mom's and your dad's and uncles and friends.
