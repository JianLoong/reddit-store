She agreed, then asked me if her boyfriend(20 M) could also come I said sure because I knew him, they started dating in 11th grade so he became close with me and my family. They arrive and I tell them that my apartment is only a 1 bed 1 bath so they would have to share my couch they didn't have a problem with it. So then a hour a later I take them to get pizza for dinner. Once we get back and we eat I told them that I have to go to bed early because I had work early in the morning. I told them that it was pillows and blankets in the closet and feel free to eat whatever they want. So then while I'm sleeping I hear like a banging/bumping sound but I just ignored it because my apartment complex is in the hood so it's a lot of loud neighbors and sirens in the area. So then I get up to get some water and it was like 3 AM. When I walked out of my room my sister and her boyfriend were out of breath and sweaty, and just staring be down until I walked back into my room. I was just a bit weirded out but didn't really think anything of it since I was half sleep. Then like around 4:15 I hear loud ass screaming so I run out of my room and my sister and her boyfriend are having sex. They were butterball naked, cheeks all on my couch. So then I curse both of them out and tell them to put some clothes on and get out. I got them a uber because neither of them had a car and they took the bus here.\n\nI don't really think I'm the asshole because I told them that I had work early in the morning and they still didn't give a fuck.", "created_utc": 1691191383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ifd2u/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_and_her_boyfriend_out/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I still think kicking them out is a bit harsh but having sex at all is a bit sus and doing it loud enough to wake op is def not cool.  \n\nWhat is the living situation with sister and bf?

As when I read it and as it to share it did not say invited. It said the words came over. There for I did not know if it was a tenant.

Still my option she a grown adult and by letting them know it was a single night the sister should have known sexy time was gonna happen."]}
