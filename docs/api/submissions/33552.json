Having a night nanny does not make you a bad mother.", "NTA\nThey're just jealous that they can't afford a night nanny, so they get mad.

She and Derek are making the best choices for their family with the resources they have.  That not everyone has those resources is sad, but in no way make Lily a bad mom.  \n\nI can understand Lily\u2019s concern though.

They needed to be called out. NTA.", "NTA if we have been able to afford a nighttime nanny, then I might not have had such severe postpartum depression. People have to do what is best for them.

It\u2019s from a place of jealousy. Good on you for sticking up for her, motherhood is isolating no matter your circumstances, we all think we need to \u2018do better\u2019.

What matters is someone is there for the baby, and that baby\u2019s parents are healthy and sane for the kid.", "NTA and their jealous asses need to STFU before Lily has an epiphany/discovers she can disown their asses for being rude to her.", "NTA. I doubt any parent \"wants\" to be sleep deprived and wake up a few times a night to take care if their kid. They do it because it has to be done. If Lucy can afford a childcare, it is just great.", "Please if they could, they would do the same. They just trying to make themselves feel better because they couldn\u2019t have what Lilly have.

And they actually support mothers throughout it!!! In the US this concept is finally gaining traction and night nurses are steadily becoming more popular and utilized because people understand that recovering from that level of trauma while remaining fully active and on all day caring for that newborn is PSYCHOTIC! And depending on the extremity of the labor and delivery at times that postnatal support is even more vital for the wellbeing and safety of mom and baby.\n\nGood for Lily that she has a husband that recognizes her need for help, and amazing that they have the resources to get it. She went thru severe birth related trauma per what you said and her own family members are acting that way because they have bitter hearts. I hope her husband will be able to help her understand she\u2019s doing nothing wrong by getting the extra help and support. At the end of the day the best thing she can do for that little one is get and accept any and all help she needs/can.

I come from Mexico and I live in the south, here they are more sexist than in the center.

Having a night nurse/nanny does not make someone a bad parent, and it doesn\u2019t magically make a parent less competent when the nanny isn\u2019t there. They\u2019re only there for an allotted amount of time, and your SIL is taking care of the baby the rest of the time. Those other women were being mean, likely out of jealousy that your SIL gets more sleep than they do. Keep encouraging your SIL to not worry so much and keep supporting her when women tell her she\u2019s a bad mom. She\u2019s doing just fine.", "NTA\n\nLily is struggling. You wrote that her health is not the best atm. I doubt that staying awake at night would improve her health...\n\nLily's relatives can kick rocks.", "Hahaha. NTA\n\nYou are right. Those women said that because they are jealous. \n\nI have a son and I would love to have a nighttime nanny. I got a SNOO instead. \n\nIn Asian culture, if you have spare money, the first month with the baby you can go to a daycare centre full or nurses and doctors and the my will take care of you. If you really have money, you hire a full time postpartum nanny to take of you and the baby at night. Asian culture really put this big must do for mom to get their health back on track. If you are poor, family will step in to help you. \n\nOne of my co-worker got lucky too. Her mother hired a full time postpartum nanny. She told us it cost $8000 for the whole month. We just told her we don\u2019t have the money and can only be jealous and that is so cool. \n\nLily\u2019s female relatives are jealous. And want to make her feel bad. They want to feel their lack of sleep has other benefits. That their sacrifice was not all to waste. Calling her a bad mom was totally out of line. They want to say I am so jealous and I hate you have advantage that I don\u2019t. It won\u2019t make them look good so they call her a bad mother. \n\nIt will probably only get worst for her. When she can send her kids to top schools, they go get more vicious. She should get ready to fight and defend herself before they take liberties on her and her family. It\u2019s best she start strong, once they get an inch, they will take an arm.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Lily has a really good friend and SIL in you. It also sounds like Lily has some health issues, and quite possibly getting up with the baby at night might not be good for her. However, I do have to ask, how often IS your nephew still getting up at night? At a year old he should be sleeping through the night. Maybe the Nanny needs to start working on getting him to sleep through the night instead of constantly getting up with him.", "Nta. But i'm worried about her. I hope she brings her husband or you the next time. They are so mean to her. And she's to nice to stand up for herself.", "NTA.\n\nLily's cousins sound jealous and bitter.

They\u2019re exhausted because their babies are keeping them up at night, and they console themselves by telling themselves that it\u2019s really a positive.\n\nThey\u2019re also taking what Lily told them to extremes \u2014 Lily just has a night nanny, so she\u2019s still doing lots of childcare and bonding, but with adequate sleep and taking care of her health. Some parents get super lucky and their kids sleep through the night early; that\u2019s not \u201cmissing out on bonding\u201d either. Nor would sharing care of the child with the other parent be missing out.", "Currently have a new born, if I could afford a night nanny, even for one day a week, I would do it.

I don\u2019t know what health issues she has but they were an issue because she no longer worked.", "I\u2019d label myself as a bad mom if I did that. But what works for other people doesn\u2019t affect my life.", "Yes, it sometimes feels like women can't win no matter what they do.", "She has enough health problems that she had to stop working, this sounds less like a luxury and more like an adjustment they had to make so she can have some energy at least.", "As someone who had a live in nanny, who did a lot of feeds and wake-up care. It hasn\u2019t impacted my bonding with my parents at all. My mom is my best friend, she\u2019s awesome and I love her. I love my dad, and I love our former nanny. She\u2019s still a huge part of my life in my 40s. \n\nI was just fortunate enough to have THREE wonderful and amazing parental figures. Each played a different role in my life, but my mom is and always has been my mom.", "I mean do you say the same thing about the dad? Is he not a parent because he doesn't handle the kid at night?", "not every can be as perfect as you. \n\nDid you not read the part where Lily's health took a turn after the birth. Maybe hiring a night nanny was so Lily can rest and be a more active parent during the day, instead of her struggling. Being sleep deprived and being ill sucks major ass even without a child to look after. I'm sure a lot more parents would have help if they can afford it.", "Just because they have a night nanny, it doesn't mean she doesn't engage with the child. This idea that people who have nannies don't actively parent is absurd. There is no information about how she spends her day, only that she doesn't have to wake in the night. \n\nSource - a close friend has a nanny  and a full time job and still spends more time actively parenting than a truck load of men i know put together.", "She stays with the baby during the day. The nanny is only at nighttime. And what's wrong with having help? Especially since lily has health issues. You sound like a jealous troll. Let me guess : you spend all your time looking after your kids and resent this so you want others to be just as miserable as you... grow up", "I\u2019m jealous of Lily and I don\u2019t have kids.", "I would have loved a night nanny when my children were younger. If anything, it will help lily be a better mother than she would be, because she's well rested. Family are jealous, as am I, but I think most of us would have better manners and just be happy for her.", "I\u2019m not jealous of Lily, I\u2019m envious. Wishing I could have a nighttime nanny but not wishing Lily ill.", "They're jealous and dumb. Plenty of partners take on some or all night feeds so their partner can get a decent night's rest and be up with the baby all day. This doesn't affect the mother's bond to the child at all. They're jealous and spiteful. Lily just needs more reassurance from other mums her age. Maybe she needs to find a local mother and baby group or to spend more time with husband's family.", ">Nor would sharing care of the child with the other parent be missing out.\n\nAgreed. If Lily's husband (instead of the nanny) was the one getting up with the baby, would they still think Lily was a bad mom for missing out on that bonding time? \n\nThat reeks of misogyny in addition to the jealousy", "When our kiddo was young, I handled every night time incident, because my wife has a much more difficult time going back to sleep.  Working on 4-5 hrs sleep became the norm.  That doesn't mean in the slightest that my wife failed to bond though.  \n  \nIt was different when the baby was a newborn, because she had to nurse, but every wake-up-crying or diaper change was mine.", "Also currently have a newborn. Can\u2019t imagine wanting some random person to be caring for her this early. It is hell but I wouldn\u2019t have a night nanny even if it was free. \n\nNot sure why people care what other people do though. Their kid, their life.", "They also want Lily's hubby, who loves her and supports her by making sure she has all this support around her.", "If I could be a better mom during the day to my child by getting more rest, I\u2019d appreciate the help but I raised 2 kids without that kind of luxury, most of us do. I agree if it works for her, not my business. I just felt people were hard on her and judgmental for their own reasons, which they should have kept to themselves.", "Amen!", "Seems so. And she probably worries enough on her own about not bonding without others saying it to her.", "That\u2019s wonderful.  I mean I wouldn\u2019t have minded the occasion help at night from a nanny so we could sleep. But I did enjoy those night time snuggles. A balance is good.", "yes? why have a kid if you\u2019re just going to delegate the tedious tasks to a caretaker?", "Yea.

We\u2019d all definitely be better mothers if we were better rested as would have more energy to play with our kids for hours on end, read same book ten times in a row, take them to new places that stimulate them well, cook nice new meals etc. We\u2019d also have more energy for self-care activities like working out that would make us feel good etc. The list is endless!", "yeah, that's essentially a major role that my parents played for my sister and BIL when my nieces were infants. For the 1st year, my BIL would do the midnight feeding, than he'd go to bed. My mom would do the next feeding (or 2 depending), until my dad woke up at 6 to help my mom with that feeding.\n\nIf my sister woke for any of them great, but my mom was fine handling it. The babies nursery was right next to her and my dad's bedroom for a reason. \n\nAnd it made it much easier both for my sister and BIL to parent, but also my BIL was working and my sister was in school. If you have someone who can do that for you? It's an amazing gift.", "They were. None of it is any of their business. If the help works for her, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s her kid and her life. If they don\u2019t want the nanny, they don\u2019t have to have one. Just like I wouldn\u2019t want one and wouldn\u2019t get one. But her getting one is what works for her family. Why can\u2019t people figure out that people are different and different things work for different people?\n\nLove how I got downvoted for having an opinion on my own parenting though.", "Would you say the same thing to a working parent? Why have kids if you\u2019re going to work and they spend all day in daycare. At least a night nurse is there for the time the child will be mostly asleep, working parents miss out on time where their child is awake and can be interacted with.  \n\nLily has health problems, I doubt they were planned for. She has a night nurse so she can get good sleep and be a good mom when the child is awake. It\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t spend any time with her child, she most likely spends a lot more time with her child than most working fathers.", "So why didn't you say she'd regard the nanny as a paternal figure? You specifically said maternal, indicating you had zero problem at all with the absence of the father.\n\nAnd in your world in that case, no parent could ever have a job, daycares wouldn't exist, nannies would be obsolete. Every parent would be full time engaged in child care. Somehow, I really don't think that's what you thought when you shat on a woman for having help.", "And you know that how?\n\nOr are you just some jealous troll who is shitting on others because they can afford what you can't?", "What's happening her is you being a frustrated troll... too bad your life sucks, but it's no one's fault that you don't have any friends", "I have a kid and 2 needy cats and I\u2019m pretty sure they agreed on a schedule to be sure at least one wakes us up every night!\n\nI\u2019m certainly jealous of Lily, and I\u2019m sure she has a lot of occasions to bond with her baby during the day. And the best thing is that she is well rested and probably in a good state of mind to really take care of and enjoy her baby during the day. I can definitely say there were some days I was so exhausted my goal was just to keep the baby and me alive until the end of day.", "I totally need that one too, my cat loves to wake me up at 2a.m. to go out and 5a.m. to get in xD", "I remember my mom tried to shame me because I said I didn't want to have a baby until I could pile up the money for night nurse for the first few weeks. I shut it down. \n\nI know it's expensive but I also who I become when I am exhausted. I don't want to subject my newborn or my husband to that person.", "InJapan, the mothers physical, spiritual and mental health after birth and for the first 6 weeks or so is paramount. It's such an accepted part of their society that women who pair with a new Mother can be booked  as soon as a couple find out they're expecting meaning they have actual wait lists! These women help with everything. Night time care  house care, food prep. They help Mother and child bathe, meditate. I watched a video series by a new Mum in Japan go through her post partum time and it was all about healing and learning about her baby and herself as a Mother. We could learn a lot from Japan!", "I will say the mommy hormones helped a bit with the sleepless nights. Like I was still exhausted but wasn't a bear like I'd usually be with no sleep. A night nurse would have been a godsend though. My husband and I took turns doing the nightly wakeup so at least one of us would get a good night's sleep at a time. We were both pretty out of it the first two months though."]}
