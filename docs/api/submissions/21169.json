For example, you don\u2019t easily cave under pressure and you aren\u2019t easily gaslit (you came here to ask questions instead of just immediately kowtowing to your family).", "I get it. I have a friend who has beautiful hair and she feels that it\u2019s 100% her sex appeal. Short hair has been attempted, it\u2019s a no go. I\u2019m glad you love your hair, you do NOT have to cut it for anyone. \n\nNTA.", "Preach!  That sentence was tough to read.  OP might have some magnificent locks, but I don\u2019t doubt there are many good things about who she is beyond that.", "Agreed- I was coming to say just that- it\u2019s obviously NTA but reading OP saying \u201cthe only good thing about her\u201d is her hair was rough.

And of course, being a 17 year old isn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park for body imagine either"]}
