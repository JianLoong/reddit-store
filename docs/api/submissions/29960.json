He is micro managing your research, but at the same time too divorced from it to understand how it works. His professional rivalry is also getting in the way. He has been rude. If he did not understand these things would drive you away, then he is an idiot. His project funding problem is of his own making. It is possible to drag someone else in mid semester, but his range and quality of candidates will be lower.\n\nA smart person would learn from this experience. They would request (someone other than him) to give you an exit interview to clarify why you have abandoned your research. But he won't. Go live your life and forget about him. No longer your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA. Many people in academia cannot be reasoned with, especially if they are in a position of power such as a tenured professor. They will most likely not change course even if a graduate student tries to express their concerns and grievances in a diplomatic manner. This is a difficult situation and your solution - quitting and finding a new job - seems very reasonable. \n\nIt is unfortunate that your supervisor lost his grant money. But, it is not your fault that someone else failed to anticipate the consequences of their own condescending behavior.

Before a career switch, I was a tenured university professor.  Your professor sounds quite rude but not out of the bounds of what I've heard of from former colleagues.\n\nYour refusal to give live tutorials could be seen as problematic, but it's not really unreasonable--you're treating your professor in the same way he treated you.\n\nMost importantly, if your professor has tenure, he's had five or six years to learn how to mentor graduate students, successfully execute on research grants, and build up a robust research program.  Apparently he's failed on all of these fronts.  So all this is on him.  You've done nothing wrong.  As a side note, if you care about the department you're leaving, you might schedule an interview with the department chair or the director of the graduate program to explain why you're leaving.  They may take steps (not that there's much they can do that's really serious) to improve your professor's treatment of his students.", "True. There is no end to the level of petty vindictiveness.

I met enough of those in my own academic career. The document is a proper solution of OP. Who is definitely NTA", "If you had a six year career you should know how to communicate then.

His grant management is not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nJust because he is tenured doesn\u2019t mean he is not responsible for treating his graduate assistants at least well enough to keep them around.", "NTA\n\nAcademia is known to be populated with egomaniacs and narcissists. He sounds insufferable and I don't blame you for leaving. You can't treat people like crap and expect them to just stay there in take it. He sounds like the type of guy who would have probably not given you the proper credit for your work anyway.", "Edited to add judgement: hardcore NTA. \n\nYour advisor was terrible and you were right to GTFO, but there were better initial options available. \n\nGoing to the department head or (if necessary) dean and asking to change advisors would have been a good first step. You aren\u2019t stuck with a bad advisor. \n\nGetting a job and dropping out mid-semester may limit your options in the future, if you decide you want to complete your degree or otherwise continue your education. I would probably advise going back and documenting with the school what went wrong and why you felt you had to run as a protection against future issues. \n\nIf you don\u2019t trust the school to listen - which unfortunately happens far too often, even when students are being harmed - it would still be good to document everything and stick it into a \u201cjust in case\u201d file so you have proof should you ever need it. \n\nBut you owe nothing to your former advisor. If he wanted to keep his status and grant money he should have done his fucking job, and without mistreating his student. \n\nYou never owe anyone the opportunity to harm you, no matter how much it may benefit them. Bad advisors - like bad bosses and bad parents - get to face the consequences of their shitty actions.", "And depending on when the withdraw period for OP's university is, they might be tanking their GPA by leaving mid-semester. That might not seem like a big deal now since they've got a job lined up but it could bite them in the ass if they ever want to go back to school (or to get a job that will look at academic transcripts).", "He has told me before that he has only worked in academics.\n\nIn any case, the job is out of state.", "Why is it her job to teach the tenured professor the basics of how to handle a student researcher?      Hint - it's not.    I can't see how this is an ESH situation in any way.", ">Your professor sounds quite rude but not out of the bounds of what I've heard of from former colleagues\n\nMy cousin had the same experience, except she went nuclear and complained directly to the dean during the course of her research LOL", ">NTA, I hope he learns from it (but probably not)\n\nSpoiler: He won't.", "Sure, if the prof pays OP a hourly wage of OP's choice. \n\nNever work for free, especially for a-holes", "I've completed my coursework section. We're all good on that front.", "I am moving out of state for this new job.\n\nAlso the prof has told me that he has no work experience and everything he has done is all purely academic research.", "NTA.

Sucks that I have to move, but it's a great opportunity and it gets me the hell away from this guy.", "Eh, it is not OP's job.\n\nAnd as someone else who bailed on grad school, I can tell you that the professors with the biggest attitude problems and bad social skills will not give a rat's ass about OP's feedback.  \n\nOp should quietly go about their new job and pray that the professor forgets that they even exist.   Telling the professor that they suck will only make the prof more likely to impact OPs career prospects", "It's not anybody's job to teach a grown man how to treat people with respect.", "It sounds from this comment like you did give him feedback several times without him ever showing that he listened and respected you.\n\nAs much as it is your responsibility to give feedback, it\u2019s also as much his responsibility to create an environment of trust to make you comfortable giving said feedback. Especially since he\u2019s in a position of power over you.\n\nAt the end of the day, him risking losing this grant is the result of his actions. NTA", "NTA. It also sounds like you're in a pretty strong position to give honest feedback to the department about why you are leaving part way through. So many grad students aren't able to do this (reliant on references) or don't have the confidence to do this, but it would really benefit academia if they did.", "Also documentation is one of my stronger skills. I've had students over my TA'ing time that did their work terms with my old team. The first set of documentation they got? My documentation for maintaining systems. That's how they knew my name.", "Honestly, someone talking that way to me is a new experience.\n\nI've made mistakes at work and received a reprimand (it was deserved) but they never used that tone or those words with me.", "It's not OPs job to address their supervisor's shortcomings. That's how you get screwed by some egotistical academia asshole.", "Not knowing how to magically stop someone else\u2019s misbehavior never makes the victim an asshole. \n\nYes, there were other options that would useful to try first in terms of protecting the OP, but not handling abusive behavior perfectly is never a problem. \n\nThe person acting wrongly is always the asshole. Demanding victims be perfect to get empathy and support is common, but still terrible. OP is NTA."]}
