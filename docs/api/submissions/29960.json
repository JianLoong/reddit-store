He's a tenured prof, and likely knows many people in the civilian sector. That, and you now have almost two years of research time without a viable reference to, and you'll get asked about this.", "NTA. He is micro managing your research, but at the same time too divorced from it to understand how it works. His professional rivalry is also getting in the way. He has been rude. If he did not understand these things would drive you away, then he is an idiot. His project funding problem is of his own making. It is possible to drag someone else in mid semester, but his range and quality of candidates will be lower.\n\nA smart person would learn from this experience. They would request (someone other than him) to give you an exit interview to clarify why you have abandoned your research. But he won't. Go live your life and forget about him. No longer your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA. Many people in academia cannot be reasoned with, especially if they are in a position of power such as a tenured professor. They will most likely not change course even if a graduate student tries to express their concerns and grievances in a diplomatic manner. This is a difficult situation and your solution - quitting and finding a new job - seems very reasonable. \n\nIt is unfortunate that your supervisor lost his grant money. But, it is not your fault that someone else failed to anticipate the consequences of their own condescending behavior. If the tables are turned, a professor (or an employer) wouldn't think twice about sidelining you.", "NTA, as long as you are comfortable having burned this bridge.

Before a career switch, I was a tenured university professor.  Your professor sounds quite rude but not out of the bounds of what I've heard of from former colleagues.\n\nYour refusal to give live tutorials could be seen as problematic, but it's not really unreasonable--you're treating your professor in the same way he treated you.\n\nMost importantly, if your professor has tenure, he's had five or six years to learn how to mentor graduate students, successfully execute on research grants, and build up a robust research program.  Apparently he's failed on all of these fronts.  So all this is on him.  You've done nothing wrong.  As a side note, if you care about the department you're leaving, you might schedule an interview with the department chair or the director of the graduate program to explain why you're leaving.
