Now all the money goes into our joint account, but we still have our other accounts open. We have used that money as emergency funds for bad income times (like now, my husband has been affected by the writers/actors strikes). So we have been accessing that money to make sure that our bills are still being paid. My husband 100% trusts me with our money, I\u2019m the one who budgets and pays the bills. I have never once asked him to transfer all of his money into my accounts, I just tell him how much is needed in the joint account and he does it then.

I read some of your answers to questions in the comments and it's highly suspicious. \n\nAlso, still don't understand why your credit score has anything to do with having savings account or having your name on a savings account. Also, you don't need to transfer all your money to her account every month. You need to have funds available for not only emergencies but general everyday spending.", "NTA. \n\nThis entire situation feels really odd. I can only think of 3 possible explanations. \n\n1) I am either misunderstanding your situation or you explained it in a way that is not accurate. \n\n2) You are both just fumbling around with your finances and are making weird decisions/requests out of ignorance. \n\n3) she knows exactly what she is doing and is taking advantage of your ignorance. Her request is super suspicious. Puts your life savings in risk and doesn\u2019t provide you with any benefits or protections. \n\nIf you two tried to open the account together, but you were rejected but the account was still made, then that is her account. It is not a joint account and even with good credit, you would now need her approval to be added as an account holder. \n\nBased on how sketchy this entire situation makes me feel, I would suggest that you two keep your personal savings separate and have a joint checking account for shared expenses.", "NTA.
