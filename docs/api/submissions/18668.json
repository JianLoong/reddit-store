One of my neighbors told me to call animal control after they went online for help, so thats what I did. I called animal control once, twice, and finally a third time. Nothing ever changes, so thats why I've now resorted to a megaphone. They live across the street from me, and our street is rather busy and large, so I wasnt able to yell far enough.\n\nI finally got to use my new toy after 30 minutes of their annoying dogs, and I told them to \"take their damn dogs inside. I told them that if they want to take their stupid annoying dogs outside, they can use the back yard they have. Not the front yard. Nobody in this neighborhood wants to hear your dogs. We have dealt with this shit since March, and were fucking done.\" I will continue to use this megaphone until they take their dogs inside. **I took about 2 minutes for them to take their stupid dogs inside. (EDIT: This is bolded since you guys think I spent like 3 hours on the megaphone)**\n\nA few hours later one of my neighbors knocked on my door and told me that I went to far and that I was TA for disturbing the whole neighborhood just so I can complain. I told him that if he wants to complain about a disturbance, then he can look no further then that fucking dog ridden house. I told them that my house has no AC and I want to open my windows to let the air in. I told him that the world doesnt revolve around him and that hes not the only person on this neighboorhood. I basically told him to pound stand\n\nThe day later one of his fuckbuddies came by and told me I was TA for blowing up in his face, and that it wasnt his fault that my house is old and rickity. I slammed my 1800's door in his face. So, I think I'm in the right, but was a too rude and far?

No one person is the only person in this neighborhood and the world doesn't revolve around any of them, so everyone in the neighborhood has to put up with the bad behavior of one neighbor so that one neighbor can have what they want.

You were so bothered by your neighbors\u2019 dogs barking that you passive aggressively bought a megaphone to shame them into resolving the barking problem. And for you, that was the obvious and correct solution to resolve am issue that was bothering you. \n\nBut when your neighbor comes to your door like an adult to tell you that you\u2019ve annoyed him with your megaphone antics, that is absolutely unacceptable, egocentric behavior.\n\n\nLOL.
