We share literally everything except for underwear and bras. My other two sisters are so close and they share everything with each other. But the get so defensive whenever I use one of their stuff. And whenever I buy something I really like, lip balm, mascara or anything. They take it away from me and use it until it\u2019s over (I didn\u2019t use it). Whenever I tell my dad that they used it and finish it he gets angry because \u201cthey are your sisters if you don\u2019t love them now and share everything with them, when are you going to??\u201d. I tried explaining to him that I do love my sister and that I just don\u2019t like when people use my stuff and they can use my stuff if they asked my nicely and return it after using it. Anyways nevertheless, whenever I get a gift (perfumes and lotions or makeup) or when I buy stuff, I hide them in my hiding spot. No one knew where my hiding spot is, except for one person. My bff (16 f). One day dad told us that he\u2019ll be taking us to the swimming pool. I prepared everything and since our body spray is done I had to get mine which was pretty expensive. After I finished swimming we were about to leave so I took a shower dried myself and went to get my backpack. I saw my body spray on the floor next to the pool. It appeared to me that my sisters saw it, used it, throw it, kids played with it. I hate my ducking life. Days later I took a shower and was about to change, but one of my sisters were in the room sleeping so I was like \u201cduck it she can\u2019t see I\u2019ll take it out use it and return it without noises.i was wrong. my sister was awake she was only in a sleeping position. And that\u2019s the thing I hate for my sisters. they always stay in bed for an hour after they woke up. A week pass by, and I keep noticing that my body sprays, lotions and make up place. Keep changing, even though it\u2019s only slightly different angles. I confronted my sisters, and they said that I am a selfish person and stingy for keeping my stuff for ME! On the same day, I changed the hiding spot and they thought just because I allowed them for a couple of days to use my stuff that I will always allow them to. So they tried searching for my stuff all over the house. and to be honest, I didn\u2019t change the place a lot. My sisters are quite stupid. today one of my sisters came to me, asking for a perfume I have. This perfume my best friend bought it for me. It was from Dior. pretty expensive, I know. I told my sister is that I had enough of them taking my stuff and then I will never ever allow them to take my stuff again from me. They got so mad calling me names and saying that I\u2019m a very mean person and that if I love my sisters, I should share my things with them. but I definitely don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. and they even threatened to h!t me if I didn\u2019t give them the perfume.

Entitled and mean, that's what they are.\n\nMove out when you have the chance, and I pray you'll make it big one day, so that you can flaunt things in their faces that they can never have, and if they try to be funny - your tall and/or muscular friend, or bestie, or boyfriend, or husband, will get in their faces and thunder at them to BACK.

Your father is enabling your sisters to act and treat you very poorly. There is a difference between happily sharing and basically being threatened with violence if you don't. If they hit you press charges! Keep any evidence of abuse and threats in a diary and report it. I would say move out but that's very difficult at your age", "NTA. Sisters or not, you're allowed to set boundaries on what you do and do not share -- especially when they're clearly taking advantage and taking more than their \"fair share\" to the point where you don't even get to use some of the things you bought for yourself. And especially give that all of you are essentially adults (maybe not you officially, but 17 is frankly close enough for this purpose).\n\nActually that's probably the biggest red flag here in all of this -- your adult sisters are literally acting like little kids. Seriously, threatening physical violence over not letting someone borrow your perfume is immature at best,... but let's face it, they're being abusive and your dad is enabling them by not stepping in and by encouraging you to let them continue to cross your boundaries.\n\nFor your sake, I hope you can move out and away from this toxic family dynamic soon.", "NTA presuming you dont take liberties with your sisters stuff", "NTA\n\nYour fully grown adult sisters are acting like entitled little brats.

If it continues then there's no reason you shouldn't also feel entitled to using their products, and treat them with just as much carelessness as they treat yours.\n\nIf they run to your parents then whip out the same \"oh but we're sisters they have to share with me\" that they've been using this whole time.", "NTA some people are so selfish, it\u2019s maddening. Ask your bff if you can keep your most treasured things at their house for a while. \n\nThen start using your sister\u2019s things ALL THE TIME.

If you don\u2019t love me now and share everything with me now, when are you going to?\u201d Said in a very sweet, innocent way. \n\nHave your phone recording even if it\u2019s just to get their response. Then you can go to your father and show how unsisterly and unloving they behave towards you. \n\nYou are your own person. You should be able to have possessions that are yours alone. You are not 1/3 of a person, to expect you to share everything is so disrespectful of your parents. If it was given to you, or you bought it, it\u2019s yours. \n\nYou say some perfumes are gifts. Is there a person or relatives that tend to buy you these type of gifts? Do any of them live close enough and are sympathetic that you could chat with them? Like I say how much you love the present they\u2019ve given you, would you be able to keep it at their house and come over to use it? Otherwise, your sisters will use it all on you. \n\nIf none of these things work, ask your friend if they could keep a couple of things at their house. Then only have generic lotions.", "Your father sounds like TA using that line will only get worse as time goes on. Soon it will be not only about your sisters it'll be other family members, partners etc. This sounds very toxic.\n\nIf you don't want to share your things then no should mean no. What next your sister will steal your partner and your father turns around like \"if you love your sister you can share your partner with her too right\" \n\nLove is not a good reason to overstep boundaries and try and guilt you into saying yes otherwise it'll look like you hate them. They are over 20 and should be acting like adults, instead they sound like spoiled teenagers always being told yes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was A CHRISTIAN, mind you - yet my parents didn't care - all they cared about was that she wasn't my race.\n\nSo I went the full nine miles. Cut contact, moved out (still in the same city though), and even switched churches. THAT was when they knew that perhaps they'd gone too far. We managed to fix things, but they spoke to me with much more respect and much less parental-dictator attitude.\n\nBe brave, OP. If you need to move when it's time, do so.

You choose to defy all societal norms, take the bravest route, and flee, flee far from it all - perhaps to another country in Europe or North America - and build a new life. It will be rough, there will be many sacrifices - but for the first time, you can be free, and you can define yourself for who you are.\n2. You choose to continue to use tactics and subtle avoidance to make your life bearable. It will suck, and you'll have to spend your life always making back-up plans and thinking of how to sneak around barriers. The good thing about it, though, is that you'll stay in a place where you are familiar, and you get some degree of freedom. A balance.\n3. You just cave to the pressure and hope that your husband will be, as you said, \"A good one\". No guarantee of that. You may have no freedom, you may be prevented from defining yourself in some ways that could've built up your confidence. But - you will be well-accepted by your family, and maybe your husband's family, as someone who \"sticks to the rules\".\n\nConsider these choices, and if there's anyone you can trust to not rat you out to people that you don't want to know about this... talk to that person.

One thing to do to hide stuff effectively is not to hide all of it. Leave a few of your least favorite items out as \u201csacrificial\u201d so your sisters will find them and not look for the rest.

Good luck!", "NTA, sounds like a pretty bad situation. See if you can keep this stuff at your friend's house.", "I don't think that would do anything.
