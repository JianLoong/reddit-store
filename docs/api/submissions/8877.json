If you felt like doing them a favor, you could tell them that they could drive to you and give you $120, for the rice cooker, gas, and 2 hours that it took to drive there to get it.

Fuck that lol. \n\nIf they said they would pick it up and pay for extras. Sure, take that deal.", "NTA\nIt's yours now.  They screwed up, by not getting their new rice cooker first.

You did nothing wrong you deal was fair.", "NTA, you owe them nothing- a deal is a deal, and this is frankly a ridiculous ask from them.\n\nIf you think they might keep bothering you if you say no, you could always tell them, oh sorry, already gave it as a gift so I don't have it anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You bought it and can say no to give it back.", "It belongs to you so you should be able to keep it.", "This could be a win-win since you don\u2019t want it anyway.  You get your  money back.  But it\u2019s on them to pick it up.\n\nEdit - my mistake. You do like it.  A sale is a sale.", "NTA\n\nYou bought it.

That they later changed their mind isn't your fault.", "NTA.\n\nEven if THEY offer to drive over and make the hour-long trip, you don't need to return it. They can still buy another rice cooker. Next time, maybe they'll purchase the larger model (or whatever) first, and THEN sell the unneeded item.", "NTA just say no. Not your problem that they didnt get to buy another one. Besides the cost of petrol to collect and if you where to return it. They're having a laugh", "NTA.  There is no contingency here.  The deal is done.  \n\nYou can sell it back to them (not return it), but what's in it for you?  The price is not $80.  You also spent time driving and gas money.  That should be included in the price.  And you will have to spend more time and effort looking for another one.  Who is paying you for all that?", "UPDATE: He tried to sell me another rice cooker that he was trying to off-load which dispels any notion of him not having one.

Enjoy your new rice cooker and ignore the seller who planned poorly.", "It could be an old style fancy large cooker\n\nAlso not sure what the currency is, i assume CAD?", "Giving you a full refund is mot even a fair deal considering you would\u2019ve driven 4 hours in total for it and all the money 4 hours of driving costs in gas", "NTA No! They can just buy another rise cooker. That they sold the old one before havind a new one was stupid and should be a life lesson. But rise cooker aren't rare items. They can go in a store and get one. \n\nAnd what if they come with \"you have damaged it!\". This could also be a scam. Just block them and enjoy your rice cooker.", "NTA. You bought it it, it's yours.  What the seller wanted to do with the money, or them having buyer's regret, are not your problem.", "NTA. Caveat emptor.", "NTA it's your rice cooker now.  (LOL and they want YOU to make the hour long trip to return it to them, LOL.  That's is some nerve, LOL.)  The IRS uses 62.5 cents per mile as the current standard so they'd need to pay you $162.50 for the rice cooker and mileage AND drive down themselves to pick it up.", "NTA. Not your problem anymore.", "NTA- find the block button", "NTA, and you're not obligated to respond: the agreement is fully executed, anything after that is simply not your problem.", "Lol nope NTA. The deal is done. That\u2019s like quitting your job before you get your next job.", "I wouldn't take that deal. You purchased something that you wanted and liked.
