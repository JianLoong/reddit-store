I used to be a healthy weight but I\u2019ve lost alot. The lowest weight I\u2019ve been was 93 lbs and the most I\u2019ve been during this situation was 103 lbs. I lose my appetite a lot. My sister (25F) however has the opposite issue. We\u2019ll call her V. V used to have an amazing figure, similar to a VS model. But she started eating more than she can burn off and went from being 120 to now 240. Ever since then she\u2019s became extremely insecure and also rather mean, but especially to me. She\u2019s always bullied and body shamed me, or just purposely been cruel to me in general ever since she\u2019s gained weight. I always kept my mouth shut because I know she just hates herself, but this time she went too far. I met this guy (21M) who we\u2019ll call C. My family invited C over for dinner. While we were at the dinner table, I didn\u2019t finish my food but I was full which is a common occurrence for me. V points this out and says I should really finish my food. I politely told her I\u2019m done and then she says in front of C \u201cIf you want to keep a boyfriend, you really should add a few pounds to you because boys want something they can actually grab\u201d. This was so embarrassing for me. C was kinda silent and my mom tried to change the subject, but I was so hurt that I kinda just snapped back at my sister and told her \u201cSo why don\u2019t boys like you? You have more than enough to grab\u201d. Atp she got embarrassed and left the table crying. My mom tried to tell me how wrong I was for mentioning her weight when I know she\u2019s self conscious about it. But I told my mom that she takes any chance she can to make fun of my body while also knowing how I feel about it and I\u2019m not gonna sit here and be her punching bag so she can feel better about herself. My family just kept saying I was wrong but tried to change the subject. The rest of the dinner went fine, and C went home. C told me he doesn\u2019t blame me for standing up for myself but my family\u2019s still convinced I was out of line. V also hasn\u2019t spoken to me in 2 days. Maybe I was mean, but this is the first time I said something back to her when she\u2019s purposely tried to hurt my feelings or embarrass me about my body for years. I feel guilty but also justified.

It's uncomfortable, painful, and can make you self concious.  No one should want to be under weight.  It's painful in a lot of ways because we don't have anything protecting your joints.  You feel cold worse than others.  You're more suseptable to the cold.  It's hard to find clothes that fight right, and comfortable, as well as cost effective.  Being told that you just need to eat a cheeseburger, or more is awful, especially when you know damn well that doesn't work.  I spent years being told that when I hit 40 I would balloon up, but let me just tell you, I'm 42, but guess what hasn't happened?  Yup, still too skinny.  It sucks having doctors consistently asking if you have an eating disorder when you know you don't.  Making it worse when you really are sick, and they still think you have an ED being sick just proves that in their minds.  Also they don't tell you that getting pregnant may not be easy if you're too under weight because your body prevents periods because it can't afford to blood/iron loss to have consistent periods.  No one considers these things when they make comments about being under weight.\n\nWere you comments right?  No, as no one should use another person's weight as an insult, but I understand why you finally snapped.  I'm not sure what to tell you to do here though.  Just know you're not alone in how you feel.", "ESH, but mostly sister. People are finally understanding that it's not okay to ridicule people for being overweight, but there's still a massive disconnect with bodyshaming for being underweight. Probably because many see it as a sort of backwards compliment, wishing they could be that thin. Your sister was completely out of line and cruel, especially in front of your boyfriend. But you let yourself sink to her level by lashing back. I can understand, though, the frustration of constant belittling.", "ESH.

Keep standing up for yourself", "NTA - Your family is saying it's wrong to body shame your overweight sister, but not when you're being body shamed because you're underweight. Body shaming is body shaming, it shouldn't be treated differently because one person is overweight and the other is underweight. You're not the asshole for standing up for yourself after constant  bullying from your sister. Your family is just saying that because they probably think it's a worse problem to be overweight than underweight, they don't understand that being too underweight is just as bad as being too overweight.", "NTA.

The fact your parents haven't been trying to nip your sisters behavior in the bud is a red flag, but something tells me you and her are likely more alike than either of you wants to admit. I'd really suggest looking into a therapist if you're able to, specifically an eating disorder therapist if you can.\n\nYour sister being shitty to you is 100% in the wrong, and you aren't obligated to try to reach out to her, but at the very least you will be better off if you learn how to ignore her or, ideally, establish firm boundaries with her that let her know what won't be tolerated from her. \n\nYour comment back at her isn't great either and won't help you.

While I do think years of frustration and shaming caused you to say such a thing, she was asking for it and to me it seems you were just taking it for a long time. I might have said the same thing.

(5\u20192\u201d, 120lbs) My doctor told me to eat small meals even if I\u2019m not hungry and Icecream ( not a crazy amount lol). You may also have a thyroid issue which can cause fast/slow metabolism.  Overall, you can\u2019t cure her insecurities and I\u2019m sorry that she treats you this way.
