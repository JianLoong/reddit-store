It wasn\u2019t her fault, company was doing mass layoffs and I saw it coming months ago when they purposefully started raising their goal requirements little by little every week until it was impossible. I was working part time, but then had to go full time because she lost her job.\n\nMy job was already difficult due to having to work from 9am-6pm and then work after hours to make sure our contractors are doing their jobs correctly (this was when I was part-time). Sometimes my schedule really looks like 9am-3am, but then they still expect me to come into work at 9am the next day. Weekends are no exception. Moving to full time only gave me more operations to be in charge of which means a lot less sleep and a lot more work.\n\nSince losing her job about a month ago she\u2019s been the one that\u2019s cleaning while also job hunting online. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help her, I\u2019m just too mentally and physically tired to move. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that I\u2019m getting around 2-4 hours of sleep daily, including weekends. On workdays, as said before, despite pulling all nighters i\u2019m still expected to drive an hour out to the office to work.\n\nShe\u2019s been getting angrier with me for not cleaning up the house, cooking, or taking the pets out with her. Shes upset that as soon as I get home all I want to do is sleep or relax until my operations for the day start. She\u2019s even been leaving chores for me to do and when I don\u2019t do them she gets pretty heated with me. I understand that I\u2019ve been lazier around the house and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s frustrating, but I\u2019m also the only one working a job that\u2019s very demanding.\n\nAs I write this, it\u2019s Saturday and I was put on an operation yesterday that spans a week. Because of time zones I have to be up until 3am and wake up at 6:45am daily to make sure the job is done correctly. Fianc\u00e9 is upset as of this moment because I haven\u2019t done any chores in the past three days. I can excuse Friday and today because work, but Thursday I slept all day because my previous op finished while I was at work, allowing me to sleep all day and night when I got home. \n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unfair that she\u2019s been the only one cleaning and has also said that I can\u2019t expect her to clean up alone because she\u2019s going to have a job soon. And I told her that because I\u2019m working full time and she isn\u2019t working that I absolutely expect her to clean while I\u2019m at work because I pay for every bill in the house.\n\nThat turned into an argument and within minutes and without my knowledge both sides of the family know now about our fight. I\u2019m being told by both sides that I should apologize, but I don\u2019t think I said anything wrong.

You literally cannot maintain this unless you have super soldier serum or something. And even then, emotionally, it's gonna kick your ass. I'm not actually sure your fiance is mad about the chores specifically. I'm betting it's way broader than that. You're telling her you EXPECT her to clean because you're the breadwinner and that's ugly, do you usually act like that? Or are you so dead on your feet that it's messing with your personality?

She never gets to see you, and when she does you can't move, you both must be miserable, no wonder you're fighting!\n\nIf you keep going like this, you might lose your fiance, sure.

She should not be getting other people to come after you about this either. This behavior is reprehensible. Furthermore, if she is out of work, she should be doing the majority of the work around the house. (Not all the work though. I'm guessing the pets are on you.)\n\nYou, on the other hand, should not be getting between 2 to 4 hours sleep per night. Your job schedule is ridiculous. Unless you are pulling in 200k or more, you should be looking for a new position somewhere else. You are leaning very heavily on her and would be regardless of her employment status.", "OK - you are working a full-time job with what seems to be insane hours. I hope they pay you well, 'cause it sounds like you're being exploited here. Your fiancee got laid off from her job. She is applying for new jobs.\n\nSo the starting point should be that each member of the household owes equal time in labor towards the common good - whether that it paid work that generates income, or domestic labor, or whatever. \n\nThe time she spends applying for jobs counts as work.

The way to fix this is to make a spreadsheet putting in how much work either of you guys do, chores + jobs included and see who has more. If hers is less, she does every single chore and you do zero chores.", "NAH but sounds like you need to find a job that doesn't drain the life out of you. Your partner might be mad about the chores, but I bet she'd like to not only have equal partnership in the household, but to spend more time with you, preferably when you're not in a zombie state. \nEdit: Also, when she finds a new job and starts contributing to the bills again, will you then magically be able to contribute 50/50 to the household with the same shift pattern? Because that's your whole argument.\nEdit 2: Don't be mad at her for bringing this up either, because in my (and countless other women's) experience, men oybwait for an excuse, whatever it is, to dump aaaaaall the household chores on a woman, and if it's not because she's at home all day, it's because of something else.", "The chore division isn't your major problem, it's your job.

See if she'll understand that.", "ESH.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should be more understanding and appreciative of your hard work and long hours, and not expect you to do chores when you are exhausted and sleep-deprived. She should also not involve your families in your argument, that is immature and disrespectful. \n\nYou should not tell her that you expect her to clean because you pay for every bill, that is demeaning and dismissive of her contributions and efforts. She is also job hunting and taking care of the pets, which are not easy tasks. \n\nYou should apologize for saying that, and also try to help out a little bit when you can, even if it's something small like washing the dishes or taking out the trash.

I\u2019d be cognizant that we are both stressed out, and she\u2019s worried about being out of work, so I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t hold money over her head in that situation.
