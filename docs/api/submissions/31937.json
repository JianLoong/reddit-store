People should be allowed to express themselves however they want, bullying is always wrong.\n\nNot saying people who are weird shouldn't think about how others will react, I am often called to do so myself, but it's not their fault if someone is harassing their child, imo.\n\nBut he's the asshole for blaming you daughter, who is a child, when he should have had an honest discussion with the school and their own children.

The first ones who should be putting an end to the bullying is the adults but no,the solution the adults have is to ignore the bullies and tell someone to just throw a hoodie on as if that\u2019s going to stop the bullying. \n\nEHS except for the child being bullied. Your brother for not going to the school and doing something about the bullying and you for suggesting your brother changes his identity so appeal to the bullies, you\u2019re doing exactly what the bullies want you to do which is be ashamed to the point of changing to what they feel is appropriate and it gives them power.", "~~YT A~~    ^(Mostly,) EHS except the kids, You for legitimizing the cruelty of the other school kids.

It sounds like the easy solution, to just put on a hoodie and not be the weird dad, and the bullying will stop, right?\n\nI'm sorry to say that it doesn't work that way. Kids are jerks, people are jerks, and if people decide to be bullies they can do for whatever reason they see fit. The bullying might have started with your brother looking eccentric, but (and this is horrible to say) if your nephew ever felt as an \"easy target\" for those kids they would have just found something else. Either way, changing now most likely won't have any positive effect. \n\nAs a side note, I do think it is actually important for your brother to not back down on this. This is his identity. He shouldn't be compromising for the sake of assholes, and this could be a good lesson for your nephew, **if he is properly supported at the same time.** \n\nI am split on your brother thinking your daughter should stand up for his son. It is true that showing support from a student from another can sometimes help the situation, and that your daughter withdrawing most likely accentuates the isolation your nephew must feel. However she is also right in thinking it could just come unto her and it's understandable she wants to protect herself. There are really no right answers on that.\n\nIf you really want to improve the situation, stop blaming each other. This won't lead you anywhere. Your brother and yourself are the adults.

The wrong thing here is your brother expecting another child to fight his battles instead of going to the principal and teachers about the bullying problem. \n\nBullies always find a reason to bully someone. They always find a target. If it wasn't this reason and your nephew, it would be another reason and/or someone else. The bullying is the problem, not the criteria the bullies have for choosing a victim.\n\nAlso, what's done is done.

How are people even noticing how this guy is dressed when he's sitting in his car? I don't remember ever bothering to stare into the cars of my classmates while they were being dropped off to evaluate their parents' outfits, that's weird) is a change that can be considered.

It would have been great if you had provided him with resources and directed him to support. It would have been great if you brought this to the principal and gotten administrative support for your nephew and your daughter.  But nope: you simply scapegoated your brother, which speaks to the latent judgment you also carry for him as well as your ability to navigate complex scenarios with multiple parties and needs. There\u2019s a practical conversation to have about ways he can realistically mitigate his son\u2019s vulnerability, but that is NOT the only conversation or solution.

The interest of a child should be paramount over any moral stance or artistic expression so I feel like the uncle should just put on a hoodie as well as pushing the school and other parents for consequences for the bullies.

Yeah, today she doesn't want to stand-up for her cousin because she's afraid she'll get bullied too. OP has supported her in this. All that has shown her is that it's ok to abandon a relative or friend when they're being poorly treated by a group. Does OP want their daughter to do that anytime someone she is close to is being made fun of or bullied?
