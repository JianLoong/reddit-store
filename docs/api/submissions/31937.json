Kids are jerks, people are jerks, and if people decide to be bullies they can do for whatever reason they see fit.

Either way, changing now most likely won't have any positive effect. \n\nAs a side note, I do think it is actually important for your brother to not back down on this. This is his identity. He shouldn't be compromising for the sake of assholes, and this could be a good lesson for your nephew, **if he is properly supported at the same time.** \n\nI am split on your brother thinking your daughter should stand up for his son. It is true that showing support from a student from another can sometimes help the situation, and that your daughter withdrawing most likely accentuates the isolation your nephew must feel. However she is also right in thinking it could just come unto her and it's understandable she wants to protect herself. There are really no right answers on that.\n\nIf you really want to improve the situation, stop blaming each other. This won't lead you anywhere. Your brother and yourself are the adults.

It would have been great if you brought this to the principal and gotten administrative support for your nephew and your daughter.

The interest of a child should be paramount over any moral stance or artistic expression so I feel like the uncle should just put on a hoodie as well as pushing the school and other parents for consequences for the bullies.

Yeah, today she doesn't want to stand-up for her cousin because she's afraid she'll get bullied too. OP has supported her in this. All that has shown her is that it's ok to abandon a relative or friend when they're being poorly treated by a group. Does OP want their daughter to do that anytime someone she is close to is being made fun of or bullied?
