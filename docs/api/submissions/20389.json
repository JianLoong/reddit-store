My wife is 27 weeks pregnant with our first. So, basically there was a fire and our home and 4 other people's homes are gone. We lost everything, including our vehicles. So, we had to go stay with my sister. The deal was that we would pay $250 a month for electric and fuel, and then buy food for the house (roughly $450-$600 a month). But needless to say, we ended up dropping like $900 on food because my sister insisted on doing the shopping. You live and learn I guess.\r  \n\r  \nWell.. my sister made dinner tonight and she didn't make enough for everyone, per usual. My wife keeps insisting on cooking because she's used to cooking for large families but my sister won't let her (her husband and kids are picky). Well.. my wife texted me and said \"I put a plate for you in the microwave before they dish their fucking dogs out another plate and leave nothing for you\". My sister and her husband both have a habit of feeding their dogs full plates of whatever is made, furthering there not being enough to go around, and my wife is definitely infuriated because she bought the food and there's never enough for everyone to get their fill, yet they feed their dogs the food regardless. So I just said \"thanks babe, I appreciate it\" and left it at that because I was absolutely famished after working 12 hrs.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I get home I go to get my food and my niece starts complaining about still being hungry. She had eaten and she's overweight (12yo, 220lbs) so I'm unsure if she was actually hungry but I felt bad and gave her my food regardless. My wife was pissed. She started crying, saying she was \"so fucking sick\" of me not being able to eat because they feed their dogs food she bought and overfeed their kid and she packed her stuff and said she would stay in the vehicle on the side of the street from now on and that I should have eaten instead of giving it away. AITA?\r  \n\r  \nETA: I want to add context.. our insurance hasn't kicked in yet and we currently don't have money for a downpayment on anything because we just lost our vehicles and I needed to purchase a new one for work.

Less stress for u and ur pregnant wife and ur dog.", "I would forever more bbq them the worst, cheapest cube steaks I could buy, extra well done. I really hope you\u2019re going to leave today. NTA, but you BIL is one for sure. $900 in mostly wasted food is a big deal, FYI. That\u2019s a huge FU to you and your wife and just a wasteful crime.", "So either they\u2019re taking advantage of you or don\u2019t really want you there but don\u2019t want to say *that* so are trying to drive you out.", "That is such a childish move. And this guy probably gets emboldened because the SIL seems to have a fear of confrontation...which same, but human food is not good for dogs and the vet bills will not be kind.\n\nShe has to get over her fear of confrontation. Sometimes it is needed.\n\nOP NTA", "You're not responsible for how your wife behaves.", "Definitely childish, but not uncommon. As I said I'd be willing to bet that either she didn't ask him or low balled how long they'd be there. Maybe that's due to a fear of confrontation, or maybe she didn't think he'd mind. \n\nEither way both the sis and bil are definitely TA", "Defiantly fear, SIL was crying when her husband started getting pissed....kinda feel worried for her and their kid, but I might just be a worry wart.\n\nAnd just as you said..they are TA, not OP", "Judging by OPs description she could've been crying just to add to the drama. You may be right, but it wouldn't surprise me if the whole thing was a show to make OP and his wife feel guilty", "NTA. Your BIL doesn't want you staying there", "NTA and they might kill your dog. Because of pancreatitis, among other things. Fatty foods put dogs in danger of pancreatitis, and three pizza slices is enough to do it.\n\nGo to a motel. It probably won't be more expensive.", "$900 in two weeks?  That's absurd.", "NYA eat cereal", "NTA. I would go absolutely FERAL if someone went against my wishes with how I wanted my own pet to be treated. \n\nHigh fat foods are also dangerous for dogs, because it can cause them to get pancreatitis, which may require hospitalization and in serious or complicated cases, can be fatal. \n\nI'm sorry you and your wife have to deal with this.", "NTA, but get the hell out of there and never go back.", "Sadly, it\u2019s OP\u2019s sister and her husband. They need to move out because it seems like his sister is spineless when it comes to standing up to disrespectful people and I personally believe each person should deal with their own family.", "You don't save food for special occasions!?! It goes bad!", "Dogs shouldn't have people food. What the fuck are they thinking?", "NTA\n\nBIL is!\n\nThank God you get to move soon!\n\nYour poor wife!\n\nPersonally? I would have stopped buying food for everyone and only bought food for my spouse and I. After the BIL first started feeding the dogs food and was told to stop.\n\nAfter you get into your new place, buy your sister a gift and thank her for allowing you to stay there. Don't apologize for anything. You didn't do anything wrong.\n\nBecause he's your sister husband? I would let this one go after you move out.\n\nExcept for one thing. He called your pregnant wife psycho. He owes her an apology.", "IMO you did the reasonable thing. You paid for the food. Dogs do not need human food (nor should they eat it because it\u2019s often bad for them). He would NEVER feed them expensive food that he bought. He just did it to provoke/use you. Leave at least him in the dust (if you have a good relationship with your sis try to hold to that). Good luck moving forwards \u2764\ufe0f", "Things dogs can\u2019t eat include tomato, onions and garlic\u2014which sounds like the kinds of things that\u2019d be included on a breakfast pizza. I\u2019d be careful with table scraps.", "Hi! I have a question that you obviously don't have to answer, and no worries if you don't know or don't feel like explaining, but do you know why bots are posting stolen comments on threads like this? I've seen this several times on the last few posts I've been looking at and I don't understand what the point of it is. Like, who is creating bots to repost stolen comments? And why would anyone do that? Lol", "It\u2019s spammers. Some subreddits won\u2019t let you post unless you have a certain amount of karma, so people make bot accounts, let them accumulate a little karma, and then use them to make a bunch of posts advertising fake viagra or whatever. AITA is a great sub for this because it\u2019s so repetitive. Half the comments are some variation of \u201cThey played stupid games, they won stupid prizes. NTA\u201d so bot comments are harder to spot.", "Oh, that makes sense! Thanks for responding! Haha, I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me. (:", "NTA. I\u2019m just shocked.

Hotel time.", "NTA Don\u2019t f with a pregnant person\u2019s food. \n\nSource: I am pregnant.", "NTA\n\nYou'll spend less by renting a furnished apartment for a month than feeding this BIL the way it is going.", "NTA- with the money you\u2019re spending on groceries, you can get an Airbnb.

No AH judgment's involved.\n\nI figure you really had little choice but to back your wife, whatever your take on the matter.\n\nAnd the truth is, you are imposing on *their home*.\n\nIf anyone's at fault, it's your wife for having a short fuse, but I realize she's pregnant. Having had to \"manage\" a wife through two pregnancies, you're definitely in a tough spot.\n\nBest solution that I can figure, if you an swing it, is simply to find other accommodations elsewhere ASAP, and let this whole thing just cool off without anyone else saying anything else about it, pointing fingers, blah blah. I see nothing good possibly coming from that, and you risk making things even worse if you do so. Good luck to you, and congratulations on the new home and the coming little one!", "I thought the same thing. He'll end up missing the good eats and hopefully the dog will get sick.", "Take your money and go stay in a hotel or airbnb, your sister and BIL are taking advantage of you.
