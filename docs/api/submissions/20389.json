Don't buy anything outside of their normal means, just things that are going quicker now because you're there. \n\nAnd good for you for defending your wife.

BIL sounds like an ass.", "NTA.\n\nYou would have been if you hadn't defended your wife.\n\nSome dogs in my family have always been fed table food also - but it was the scraps off everyone's plate.  When we were done, we would all scrape our plates onto one plate and then that would be divided up among the dogs.\n\nSide note:  Our last Thanksgiving as a family had more dogs than people bc everyone brought their pups.  Dogs rule!\n\nBut Your BIL is straight disrespecting you by continuing his actions.", "I hope you were  holding the bag open so she could toss the food in\n\nNTA", "BIL sounds like a full on maniac! \n\nI can just imagine him feeding the dog the steak while maintaining eye contact with you after you told him multiple times not to. \n\nIt\u2019s super bizarre that he\u2019s going out of his way to feed the dogs food you bought to feed yourself. \n\nDo you guys have a history? Animosity? Is he trying to get back at you for something?\n\nListen, I love feeding my dog people food, and she loves eating it. But it\u2019s always leftovers, I don\u2019t serve her full portions of our meal, and any SANE person would respect the request to stop doing so from the person paying for the food!!\n\nWifey losing her shit is understandable, you standing by her is absolutely the right thing to do.\nYup, just get out of there! \n\nDid your sister know you guys would probably pick up most of the food bills? Sounds like she had an ulterior motive inviting you to stay with her?", "NTA and this is so weird.  It sounds like your BIL is doing this intentionally to send a message to you guys - did he not want you to move in? What a bizarre way to handle it though.  \n\nAnd your sister, she thinks your wife is an AH for gathering the food you guys bought but that her husband is normal for throwing giant amounts of human food on the floor for the dogs?  \n\nYou guys need to pack up all of your food and leave now.  And then please update.  I feel like soon your parents will be brought into this.", "NTA. Leave quickly!  The behavior is passive aggressive because BIL doesn\u2019t want you there. You\u2019ve overstayed your welcome.  The stress is going to affect you child and wife.  Leave now!", "Idk about not bright, seems like BIL is crazy like a fox. Likely he wasn't on board having guests and is playing a passive aggressive game to get OP to leave. Wife is trying to placate him as she knew husband didn't want OP in the house in the first place.\n\nStaying elsewhere definitely the right way to go at this point. NTA.", "See, my wife and I would buy less expensive stuff for ourselves because we really aren't all that picky. But since we have been here, these guys have deemed themselves \"food snobs\" and won't eat anything \"cheap\". Hence, why we bought the $60 steaks. My wife and I wanted to BBQ and these guys wouldn't eat cheap end steaks so I just bought the steaks they would eat. I won't be doing that again. That's for sure.", "Her dogs are mixed breeds. Ones an Aussie Shepherd mix, ones a German Shepherd and Pit mix and the other has so many breeds in her that they just call her a mutt. Not sure what mixes she is honestly. Short haired, mid sized, brown and white. Our dog is a small dog. She's a Corgi and Weiner dog mix.", "There was no deal put in place when we moved in, no. She told us to stay here instead of a hotel because it would save us money, but it hasn't saved us anything (just spoke to wife and we will be leaving tonight). My sister and her husband just haven't even attempted to buy food since we have been here. Every time we leave, she calls out to us and says \"can you pick up something for dinner when you're out?\" The one day that we didn't grab anything for dinner, she didn't make anything for her kid to eat until almost 10pm.

You buy cheap, you eat cheap, and they won't touch your food.", "NTA. Honestly i am not sure what i was expecting to hear but the two little dogs will get really unhealthy fast if he keeps that up :( all other issues here aside\u2026", "Jeez. I get that this is your sister, but she sounds like the only reason she told you you could stay is so you'd buy them food all the time. Do they just order out/in all the time? What a waste. \n\nNTA, I'm glad you're leaving. That is ridiculous. $900 on food in 2 weeks is nuts.", "Ohhhh, apparently in your sister's head, food is the cost of you staying there. She just didn't tell you and your wife, lol.\n\nWho waits to feed their kid that late and says I thought we were waiting for you to order food? That should have told you then and there.", "They do order take out a lot, yes. I mean, their cupboards, fridge and freezer is full of food but my sister pulls the \"we are saving that for special occasions\", whatever that means. I remember one day specifically back some months ago she invited us for dinner because she bought a bunch of stuff to make homemade Chinese. She said she spent over $150 on it all, but just ended up ordering take out because come 6pm she decided she didn't feel like cooking.", "This is abhorrent!

Your BIL sounds like he has the mentality of a child.", "INFO: Why are you spending so much on food?  You should acknowledge that you and your wife have an active role in this. You saw what BIL was doing with what he saw as Free Food and yet you *kept on buying too much food that was too expensive*.  You talked to him once.  After that:  cereal, soup, salad, hotdogs, ramen.  Rinse, repeat.  \n\nYou\u2019ve both worn out your welcome.  Move on.", "$900 in food for 2 weeks!? They owe you money for all of the crap they fed the dogs, plus for the forthcoming vet bills!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Do they live with you? You should consider kicking them out/eviction. They sound insufferable.", "NTA - at this rate it would be cheaper to stay in a hotel and order out", "I am irrationally worried about the dogs,", "Not exactly due to the contents of OP's other comments, especially regarding food.", "I would also urge OP to think carefully if they ever want BIL and SIL to visit them at their new house, bc they look like the kind of people that have no boundaries and would end up going through the cupboards and eat (or give to the dogs) everything available, even as a power move.\n\nNTA", "At $900 over two weeks you aren't far off the cost of renting a long stay motel room or Airbnb.
