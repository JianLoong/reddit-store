I had a great time, but I would not have had a great time if there wasn't alcohol.  There's a reason most people drink alcohol in situations like this and that's because alcohol *works*.\n\nIMO a wedding without alcohol is like a graduation - you spend 30 seconds watching the person you came to see walk across the stage and then hours bored.

They weren\u00b4t told in advance, so they were stuck in a dry wedding without their knowledge", "We did not tell in the invitations, as invitations do not contain infos about drinks and food to our knowledge.\nAnd only one person needed a venue to sleep at (came from out of the country to the wedding)", "No. We did not think it necessary.", "> Did you have fun at YOUR wedding? That\u2019s all that matters at the end of the day.\n\nGuests aren't props set up for the amusement of the hosts; they're people who deserve to have fun too.", "You brought the vegan preference up: If we would live vegan we would not serve meat. And I think that\u2019s not wrong, because as a vegan it makes no sense to kill animals for others to eat just because they eat them normally.", "The issue wasn't about that though. The OP knew that some of her guests would over indulge and become rude. She wanted to be comfortable at an event that was about her and her husband. Why should she have to put up with drunk assholes? No one is owed an alcoholic beverage at any event. And if you have to drink in order to be social that's YOUR problem and you should get some better coping mechanisms.", "I agree, NTA for having a dry wedding but kind of the AH for it being a surprise.  A dry wedding would shift my game plan.  I would go, but maybe not get a hotel, or plan to stay for a bit and do something after.", "Invitations do usually contain information about food if there\u2019s a choice of food, or even just requests for dietary requirements. So including it was a dry wedding on there would have been a very good place to include it.", "And did you not speak to the guests more informally about it all? I can't think of anything about our wedding that we didn't chat through with various friends and family, just because. It seems weird that this was completely unknown to every guest... unless it was kept from them purposely?", "So I think having a dry wedding is perfectly OK. But a lot of people plan hotels, ubers, plans the next day based on planning to drink at a wedding. I once booked a $400 a night hotel room until a bridesmaid tipped me off and said hey they're gonna shut the party down early and I was like ok then let me cancel the room and go home \n\nIf you knew your guests were expecting alcohol and you purposefully withheld that info then ya YTA", "They had and they told us they had", "There's more to it though. If you're inviting guests that have a hard time behaving themselves and they get rude when they drink too much, then it isn't about wanting to rob people of having a good time as much as you don't want people ruining a huge event in your life. The OP clearly said that some of the family members invited over do it and get rude.", "Yes, don\u00b4t serve meat. BUT guests should be able to bring their meat or not go at all if there isn\u00b4t going to be served. You didn\u00b4t told them it was dry, such a waste of time/money/everything to go to a wedding and find out it\u00b4s dry! You should have told them about it.", "Ugh", "Have been to more than one. In each case their cake game was on point. I like cake.", "Oh I completely agree that OP should have a dry wedding if that\u2019s what they want. Absolutely no issue with that at all.\n\nI just think they should have told people in advance. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ok in my country it\u2019s not differentiated between Mocktails and cocktails. But I will keep it in mind.", "I prefer weddings with alcohol but wouldn't skip a dry wedding just because it was dry - but if I had to pay a lot of money to travel and then found out only when I got there it was dry, I'd be annoyed since I probably could've spent less.", "We don\u2019t know that and neither does OP. All we know is that 4 people lacked the class and tact to understand that you don\u2019t complain to a bride and groom about their wedding especially over text while they\u2019re on their honeymoon.\n\nSilence does not mean happiness", "She said that she had never been to a wedding before and was simply unaware of some of the procedures involved."]}
