I had a great time, but I would not have had a great time if there wasn't alcohol.  There's a reason most people drink alcohol in situations like this and that's because alcohol *works*.\n\nIMO a wedding without alcohol is like a graduation - you spend 30 seconds watching the person you came to see walk across the stage and then hours bored.

If you're inviting guests that have a hard time behaving themselves and they get rude when they drink too much, then it isn't about wanting to rob people of having a good time as much as you don't want people ruining a huge event in your life. The OP clearly said that some of the family members invited over do it and get rude.", "Yes, don\u00b4t serve meat. BUT guests should be able to bring their meat or not go at all if there isn\u00b4t going to be served.

If you AND your spouse don't drink then it doesn't make sense and it IS expensive.
