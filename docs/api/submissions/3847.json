That you don't matter to them, your marriage and happiness doesn't matter to them, they're just in it for free booze and getting their fix.\n\nThe ones who actually care for you are those who enjoyed the wedding because they had all they needed: being with you and a good time.\n\nEdit: yes I do consume alcohol.

I\u2019ve been to some dry weddings without cash bars (religious reasons) and they were still super fun. If your friends and family can\u2019t go one night without drinking then they don\u2019t care that much about you, or they care about you less than their need to drink for a wedding.

They and some of the family friends were the only ones that were going to care.\n\nIn fact, of the dozen or so weddings I've been in or to, only two had any alcohol. Both for my BIL. All of the others were dry. Indeed,there was no expectation that there would be alcohol at any of them.\n\nAs for the grandfather and the friends who are saying that they wouldn't have come if they realized there wouldn't be alcohol, it says something about their relationship with you. It also says something about their relationship with alcohol, and which they value more.\n\nMaybe use this as a sign that it's time to ponder the future of your relationships with them.", " NTA.

If I know it's a dry wedding I'll come and enjoy it, but I'll save myself money on travel etc. If it's a wet wedding I'll pay to stay at the venue or get a taxi to whenever I'm staying, and I'll expect to stay later. \n\nSome people might choose not to come at all, as for them it would make it not worth coming - having been a bride, my take is that anyone who wouldn't enjoy what I've planned for my wedding shouldn't be there, so good. \n\nSo yeah, did you hide it?

In a place where most people don't know many of the others, and most people would otherwise be quite reserved, alcohol makes it more fun. \n\nIf your family are bad drunks, then wanting to have a dry wedding is totally valid, but it is only fair to let people know so they can decide if they want to come.", "To be honest, I have never cared for weddings because it's a special, social event in which the guests are expected to use their own time, money and energy to attend. In my opinion most weddings are indulgent and the expectations for guests are unreasonable.\n\nAt the very least you can buy me a drink for making me sit through the boring ass ceremony.

With those the couple only really needs to get info on allergies and dietary restrictions in advance to guide them in selecting the menu. The menu itself doesn't have to be broadcast in advance.\n\nAnd thinking about it, it would be hard to do so completely anyway. You're going to be getting the dietary info with the returned rsvps.

Doesn't speak to their happiness level tho. Most poorly orchestrated weddings don't get bad feedback from guests, people just generally keep the comments amongst each other or to themselves.", "They were just being polite.", "As I said in my comment, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a large social gathering. I don\u2019t drink often (once-twice a week maximum) and I can very much talk to people in general without alcohol.

Is it a destination wedding? Would they have to pay for a motel/hotel? The cost of the gift. Do they have pets? Did they need to have someone watch them? What about children? Did they need to get a baby sitter? I could probably think of more reasons if I cared to.\n2. I stopped making a habit of attending weddings by the time I was 15. I went to my sister's because I was walking her down the isle. I am also a legally registered minister and I married two groups of friends this summer. Both weddings had alcohol, both ceremonies lasted less than ten minutes. These people also didn't care what I or any of the guests wore, they were just happy to have everyone there, which is often the complete opposite of how most weddings go. I did it free of charge and just for them.\n\nBy the way, don't bother answering all my \"?\"s in #1, they were just examples. I think the bigger point here is that from your own responses, you lack any sort of consideration for your guests. Like what?
