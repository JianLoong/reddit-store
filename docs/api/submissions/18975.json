On the one hand, she's right that you could leave your cat alone overnight or even for a day and that would be fine, whereas a dog would have toilet issues and potentially tear the place up, but the fact that she insists you stay over at her place instead of just each going your own ways to sleep is... Concerning.", "NTA and your gf is clingy as hell and has what I would describe as an unhealthy attachment to you. Sounds like she wants to be around you 100% of your free time. If you\u2019re cool with that then I guess that\u2019s fine for you but it is not normal and I would say is going too far. Frankly that would drive me insane. No alone time, no time in your own home, that\u2019s ridiculous for her to expect.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t even getting into the hypocrisy and how unfair it is for her to demand you come to her place all the time while never being willing to return the favor. \n\nI don\u2019t know your tolerance for such things, but if I were you I\u2019d be having some conversations with her and setting some boundaries.

Cats are independent is a myth !", "NTA. Your cat is just as important as her dog and needs attention too. As for you to have dinner together every single night, that's a bit much.

Besides that she sounds controlling af", "NTA. She sounds very controlling.", "NTA. It really just sounds like your partner and you aren\u2019t really compatible. That sucks, sure, but better to get that in mind earlier than later.

Big consideration about where your relationship is gonna go but it doesn\u2019t come across well.", "NTA. \n\nAs long as your cat has food and water, it's fine alone.

Run away and don\u2019t look back!", "NTA and sorry but do you really want your whole life to be this exhausting?", "NTA \n\nThis is never going to work. She won't acknowledge your need to spend time with your cat and doesn't want to stay at your place at all. Refusing to leave her dog with her mom once a week to stay over with you is pretty much a dealbreaker, or would be for me. If she can't compromise, there's really no relationship.\n\nPlus, contrary to what she thinks (has she ever had a cat?), cats, while independent, like their people to be around.

You two haven\u2019t been together *that* long and she is telling you that you\u2019re not allowed to have a day apart from each other? How do you ever have time to yourself? Surely resentment of not having your own time will set in and there will be bigger issues down the line. Also, the fact that she is disregarding your cat shows more than you may know. Your cat is something you care about, depends on you and that you want to make time for and she shows she doesn\u2019t care about that. And it\u2019s okay for her to not care about your cat but it sounds like she wants you to also not care. Be with someone who values the same things you do.

While you can't make or force her to change her mind, you sure can stick to your boundaries so leaving your cat for over an hour or two is \" not an option \". Relationships are about compromise and if she is not willing to meet you halfways then you shouldn't either. I also would advise you break up with her because she is selfish, manipulative and won't respect your boundaries. She's going to paint you as the bad guy anyways.", "NTA. My neighbour leaves his cat alone at nights while he either goes out or stays with his girlfriend. I can hear that poor thing screaming all night long, and it hurts my heart so so bad!

Yes, cats are more independent than dogs, but that does not mean they can be left alone all the time. They\u2019re still pets and they should still feel loved and cared for, you can leave dogs alone for longer too and it sounds like she\u2019s putting the dog over you.
