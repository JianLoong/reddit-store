{"id": 16386, "submission_id": "137lgl9", "title": "AITA for Nearly Costing my Co-Worker Her Job After She Kept Making up Rumours About me?", "selftext": "For starters I'm going to give everyone a bit of context, I myself am 16M and the Co-Worker I am talking about is 17F and I will her Katy which is not her real name for obvious privacy reasons. As well as being my Co-Worker, I also go the same school as Katy, which just makes this a whole lot worse.\n\nNow because I go to quite a small school with not many people, words can spread around fast, and this is exactly what happened. I got a bad haircut that day, and I got to say, I really didn't like it. Obviously Katy noticed and pointed it out to me, even going to the extent of calling me gay. Now I have nothing against gay people or the LGBTQ community, but I myself am not gay, so obviously this was being used as an insult, so I just shrugged it off and continued on with my day.\n\nRemember how I said my school was school, well Katy is quite a popular girl in my school and a lot of the people in my school will listen and do what ever she says, so she started telling eveyone that I was gay. Now I am one that is always one for a good joke, but this went as far as the teachers thinking that I was gay. This isnt also the first time that Katy has spead rumours about me. Because we also work together, she has spead many rumours about me being a bad worker, even though this isnt true, but the manager also believed it for a while and I nearly ended up getting fired because of it! I got sick of the insults, so I just straight up ignored her, and I mean this, not a work was said to her by me.\n\nOne day while I was working, Katy came up to me in a worry, and told me this. \"Hey, the manager is mad at me for me spilling milk all over the floor about an hour ago and just then I'm pretty sure that he told me to lift up the roller door for the truck, can you please go and talk to him and see if thats what he said?\" As you guys may of guessed it, I just ignored her. And because of this, the truck that had a lot of our supplies for the supermarket that I work in, drove back to the warehouse because they thought we were closed, because our roller door was closed and no other doors out the back were open.\n\nThe manager yelled at Katy and nearly fired her because of this. After my shift had ended, Katy came up to me and started yelling at me telling me things like, \"Why didn't you tell the manager like I told you too, you almost got me fired!\" Well, I just ignored her and walked home. This was about two weeks ago and now all I do is make small remarks about her whenever she walks past just to make her feel bad, otherwise I don't speak to her. \n\nA lot of her friends came up to me telling me that I was the biggest jerk and I should've told the manager, and apparently she has become \"depressed\" after this incident. So I came on reddit to just ask everyone a simple question, Am I the Asshole in this situation, I didn't retaliate when she was calling me all of these names, I just ignored her, I don't think I am a Asshole, but I also could be because what I did nearly cost her, her own job.", "created_utc": 1683208640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137lgl9/aita_for_nearly_costing_my_coworker_her_job_after/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your manager when Katy says these things to you at work, tell your manager everything regarding Katy at work.\n\nAs for outside of work, tell your principal about the rumors and such that Katy is spreading.

Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it. She didn\u2019t do her job and tried to get you to help. Hard to get someone to  want to help you when they\u2019re nasty to you. I think you should quit with the remarks as she walks by though. That\u2019s beneath you and immature. Either have it out with her and speak your piece or leave it.

You don\u2019t need to be friendly.", "I think she tried to set you up.

I said he's TA for not telling her no and just ignoring her. If you want to be the bigger person here you tell her, \"No I will not go ask, it's your job.\" Ultimately it is still her that needed to make sure that job gets done and she deserves to get punished for it not getting done, but the best way to handle that would have been saying No to her instead of nothing.\n\nNot necessarily an AH for not saying anything, but in my opinion telling her no was a better way to handle that situation.", "She asked him to check with the manager about the roller door.

It\u2019s not the OPs responsibility to respond to the bully, as that potentially opens the door to more bullying.  Assigning TA status to someone who ignores a bully is equivalent to victim blaming, IMHO.", "And what made her unable to talk to the manager herself other than her maybe being chewed out again for being unattentive?

Why is she asking someone else to ask the manager to clarify what they said to *her*?\n\nIf she wasn't in a position to delegate - which it seems these are kids and so she likely doesnt - then OP had no business stopping *their own work* to help out someone who can't be bothered to ask their boss for clarity.\n\nThat being said,  ESH.\n\nOP: when you have an issue its best to say it out loud.
