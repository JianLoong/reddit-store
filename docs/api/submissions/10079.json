The school she picked ended up being too expensive and none of the (private) loans would go through to pay for school (it\u2019s based on her credit and mines) and her federal loans wouldn\u2019t cover enough of it either. She was unable to go back to school for sophomore year as she didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for it. She says she\u2019s been working on trying to transfer to a cheaper school but it\u2019s been almost 2 whole semesters and she\u2019s still not back in school. I had co-signed her lease in august of 2022 thinking she was going back to school and obviously needed housing for it, but she hasn\u2019t been in school for almost 2 semesters and I don\u2019t feel like I should have to pay for her housing anymore because of that. She works 40 hours a week now at some random job in the city and she pays for all her utilities but for some reason still doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay her own rent ($1250 a month) She offered to help pay a portion of her rent but she needs to be in school and not wasting her time. Why should I have to pay for her housing if she\u2019s not even in school? It was her decision to move out of the house and go to this random city for school and school only. If she\u2019s not going to school then i\u2019m not going to pay her rent. If she wants to live out there then she\u2019s old enough to pay for that herself. \nI am a small business owner and my company is worth almost 2 million, so I can afford to pay for it but, I also have 2 other kids to take care of and another one on the way. I didn\u2019t go to college and I didn\u2019t have any help growing up and I had to figure everything out on my own, so if she doesn\u2019t go back to school I should essentially drop her and she\u2019s just going to have to figure out everything on her own.

You promised to pay for her education and the extra expenses. She dropped out not bc of lack of interest or because she was partying too hard, but because you didn't follow through on your end and she couldn't afford tuition by herself. What other recourse does she have but to work full time to try and be able to afford it? Seems like something a pull yourself up by your bootstraps lady like yourself would appreciate. But you seem upset with her for doing so and consider it a waste of time, and annoyed at her not being able to afford rent and tuition simulatenously. This is not something that's going to improve without help, at least not in the short term. If she can't afford rent, how do you think she is doing with saving substantial amounts to be put toward her education?
