The school she picked ended up being too expensive and none of the (private) loans would go through to pay for school (it\u2019s based on her credit and mines) and her federal loans wouldn\u2019t cover enough of it either. She was unable to go back to school for sophomore year as she didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for it. She says she\u2019s been working on trying to transfer to a cheaper school but it\u2019s been almost 2 whole semesters and she\u2019s still not back in school. I had co-signed her lease in august of 2022 thinking she was going back to school and obviously needed housing for it, but she hasn\u2019t been in school for almost 2 semesters and I don\u2019t feel like I should have to pay for her housing anymore because of that. She works 40 hours a week now at some random job in the city and she pays for all her utilities but for some reason still doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay her own rent ($1250 a month) She offered to help pay a portion of her rent but she needs to be in school and not wasting her time. Why should I have to pay for her housing if she\u2019s not even in school? It was her decision to move out of the house and go to this random city for school and school only. If she\u2019s not going to school then i\u2019m not going to pay her rent. If she wants to live out there then she\u2019s old enough to pay for that herself. \nI am a small business owner and my company is worth almost 2 million, so I can afford to pay for it but, I also have 2 other kids to take care of and another one on the way.

You promised to pay for her education and the extra expenses. She dropped out not bc of lack of interest or because she was partying too hard, but because you didn't follow through on your end and she couldn't afford tuition by herself. What other recourse does she have but to work full time to try and be able to afford it? Seems like something a pull yourself up by your bootstraps lady like yourself would appreciate. But you seem upset with her for doing so and consider it a waste of time, and annoyed at her not being able to afford rent and tuition simulatenously. This is not something that's going to improve without help, at least not in the short term. If she can't afford rent, how do you think she is doing with saving substantial amounts to be put toward her education?

Most parents cover college costs for their kids, it's part of being a parent. You have the means to make sure your kids get a head start in life but you just don't want to because YOU had it hard in life growing up. That's horrible. You are delusional in thinking it's easier to get ahead in life now than when you were young. It's not, it's much harder because cost of living has far outpaced minimum wage, corprate greed keeps people poor so owners and ceos get bigger paychecks and bonuses, it's harder to get loans now than 20 hears ago. Things change, opportunities are not as easy to get these days, cost of schooling has more than quadrupled in the past what, 10 years even, so has rent etc etc. Help your child like you promised and stop resenting the person YOU chose to bring into this world! You don't just \"drop your kid\" like their a piece of dog crap. Especially when they're trying and only in this situation because of you. She didn't flunk out, she didn't just drop out, she's not being flighty and out just goofing off and playing around wanting mommy to pay for everything. I feel so bad for her having a mother like you. You're acting like she's in her 30s and expecting you to pay for everything. She's not, she's a 22/23 yr old kid that was promised an education and now you're taking that away from her and then complaining because she has to work full time to cover her expenses instead of going back to school you refuse to pay for now. She doesn't \"just have to cover utilities\", she has to cover food, gas, clothing, hygiene products,etc etc etc and I can guarantee you the pizza place she's working at is barely paying her enough to cover daily living costs,let alone college.", "It is immoral and cruel to not pay for your children's education if you can afford to.", "Holy shit I can\u2019t believe you typed that and sent it. SHE IS YOUR KID. YOU brought her into this world. YOU are responsible for your child.", "she doesnt only depend on you for money, she is working full time.", "Bro she\u2019s working 40 hours a week, probably minimum wage, and paying her utilities. She\u2019s doing her best after you set her up for failure.", "You know how you ensure that? BY HELPING HER NOW! A degree will help her in the long term with financial independence, so time to invest to divest, asshole", "Well they're not depending on you for your empathy or shining personality", "You AGREED to pay for her schooling though? So what's the issue? Why are you backing out now?", "God you\u2019re fucking pathetic.", "OP - YTA. You're not trying to raise a kid - period. The only thing, you're doing, is showing your eldest daughter - and the other kids - that you cannot be trusted.\nBut there are a few holes in this story, that I'd like explained. Does your daughter have another parent in the picture? What about the other kids?\nAnd is there a difference in, how these kids will be provided for based on that? BTW - I'll be 50 next month.. I just borrowed 100 bucks from my dad. You see, in our family, we have a saying, that losely translates to: \"when it rains on the priest, it'll drip on the clergy\". Meaning if good fortune comes to one - we help the ones less fortunate. That's what families do. With any luck, you may just need help from your daughter in the future, and she will tell you, that she was raised not to mooch off relatives, so you're on your own.", "Sorry, but what? You don't want your kid to only depend on your for money, when you promised them money to support them?", "Lmao it's your fault she can't get any federal loans. If you're worth as much as you claim, the government expects the parent to chip in a % amount towards college, and factors that into loan qualification.\n\n Regardless of if the parent helps with school or not, their income is taken into account for federal college loans. So any way you look at it, it's your fault. Either for not managing expectations on how much support you'd give, your income disqualifying her from student loans, or not counseling her on going to community college to save money. She's in this situation because of you.", "Am she will not depend on your for affection either because you clearly don\u2019t have an ounce of affection for your daughter in your body.", "You forgot that you asked her to depend on you in the first place\n\nHad you straight out said that you would not help her she wouldn't have taken a college like that in the first place", "Then you shouldn't have had kids. Your kid is doing her best and you're treating it like she's freeloading.", "No, you're raising a kid who has now learned that you can't be trusted to keep your promises.", "And the plan now is...", "Agreed\nOP is literally backstabbing her daughter when she is at her worse\nShe won't thank OP but would definitely go NC", "Maybe OP's \"small business\" is an MLM or something?", "I fully agree with all this here.\n\nI can guarantee she was turned down because of ops income.\n\nI was turned down for a student loan because my adopted parents income was to high and I was still in contact with them.\n\nThey told myself and my little sister, on separate occasions, that if our parents made over a curtain amount and we still had regular contact with them, it was their responsibility, as our parents to help with school, weather it be high school or university.\n\nThey didn't want to 'waste' their money on uni for us, so we never went.\n\nI'm planing on trying again when my youngest is old enough to go to kindergarten because I've look into it and should get a loan approved this time round.\n\nOp is a major stain.\n\nYTA.", "it still stinks that financial aid is dependent on parents until a certain age. i guess the alternative would also have some downsides, but i also got screwed over by my parents not wanting to provide info for FAFSA, and never ended up finishing college. sucks. \n\neven worse in this situation, OP is making more kids to eventually pull the rug out from under \ud83d\ude44", "This. I go to a public state school, I will admit not the cheapest one but also probably not the most expensive, and my tuition for a semester outweighs my entire year of income. I work two jobs, one full time and one part time, and yet school would still be unattainable for me without loans. On top of that my parents, who aren't contributing, make way too much so I get very very little, if any, FAFSA money. Luckily I have a good credit score so I can get approved for loans without them and be able to go.", "First, stop saying it's been a year. OP keeps saying it's been almost two semesters, because that makes it seem like a longer time in everyone's brain. \n\nHere's the timeline.\n\nIt's been since August 2022. Not even 6 months has this 20 year old been out of school that OP promised to pay for. Not even 6 MONTHS has this 20 year old been working to save money to help pay for a cheaper school, while paying for utilities, while OP brags about being able to pay tuition but not wanting to because they built a 2 million dollar company company from nothing so their kid should sink or swim even though the tuition assistance was promised. \n\nNot a year. Less than 6 months. \n\nTerrible parenting.", "But were you told they'd support you, only to show they were liars?\nDad promised a college education, then reneged.", "damn that's crazy. glad you feel fulfilled and good for you. how did you pay for your AA? who got you to school before you were able to drive yourself there? howd you get that awesome paying job?\n\nnot really much of a comparison of sink or swim when one of you is thrown in the kiddy pool and the other's in the deep end and was lied to about how deep the water is.", ">What does the pandemic have to do with anything?\n\nwere you in a coma all through 2020-2022??  Were you under a rock as THOUSANDS of people lost their jobs, their homes, their LIVES????  \n\nYou screwed your daughter over because of your \"small business\".  She can't qualify for financial aid because of your \"2 million dollar business\"  Which BTW .... How the hell do you have a \"2 million dollar small business\" That obviously would be great collateral, yet BOTH your credit scores were not enough???  I must have read it wrong. \n\nI'm a year younger than you. You seriously can't remember how our lives were like 20-22 years ago?  Our rents were not over a thousand a month for a damn broom closet. Getting loans for school was much much better.  Going to a trade school was great. We could live working minimum wage, Pay 50-100 bucks to go to Doctors on duty for a broken bone or sickness, Car payments were reasonable,   etc etc \n\nYOU set her up to fail. You literally kicked your daughter, a baby bird OUT of the nest when she was no were near ready to fly. Also, if she does go back to school full time, i'm curious as to how do expect baby bird to work 40+ hours a week, plus attend and study for school full time?  Growing up, it was pounded into our brains that we need to \"work work work\" even if its for  freaking pennies.  This new younger generation SERIOULY can NOT make it on their own today with shit pay.  Hell.. many of the people from OUR generation cant make it on their own ether sadly. \n\nBe the bigger person. Play the \"mom\" part and sit your daughter down and explain to her about what you would like to be done with her education. Explain and actually help her look into cheaper colleges. Help her get her credits transfered.  Help her understand all the paperwork. Just freaking HELP HER!!", "When I was applying for financial help for school, I was turned down because my mom made too much money. They look at your parents income until you are 26 (at least here) I moved out when I was 18, and was applying when I was 22. Ended up spending about 6 years for my 2 year degree so I could afford it.", "OP should come clean with her dislike or jealously for her daughter. She never got to go to college, so neither should her daughter, is what she is thinking deep down.", "i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the flippant change of heart or the writing style, but something about this OP sounds like it was written/done by that guy that ruined the bird app. like, same level of general clownery/poor character. \n\n(not naming outright because i don\u2019t want to summon trolls/sycophants; hope they are successfully warded off.)", "Happy Cake Day \ud83c\udf82", "She also might be running into the issue of her credits not transferring. I went to transfer to a different college and like half of my credits weren\u2019t accepted at the new school. Had to search around for one that accepted all my credits", "Man, that *fucked* me over when I went to college. They look at just the last couple years of your parents\u2019 earnings. My dad had gotten a really good paying job about a year and a half before I graduated high school. But he had spent the previous 7 years barely bringing in any money, trying to accrue enough hours as a casual to join his union. So no government aid because they made too much money, and no parental aid because all of that money was going toward paying off old debts. I also never finished.", "That must have been tough. Hope you are doing well. OP doesn\u2019t realize that she is not just refusing to help, but actually that her being the mother is detrimental to the daughter getting a scholarship.", "But she didn\u2019t have any help growing up, don\u2019t you know. When that happens, it\u2019s an obligation of the parents to make all their children miserable too. /s", "Or maybe she looked at the current economy, saw that software engineers and developers at all levels are being laid off in the thousands right now, and simultaneously noticed the horrifying wait lists for mental health services? \n\nOr perhaps she realized what she likes about CS isn\u2019t an area you can easily specialize in for a career and decided she\u2019d be better off doing career choice number two?\n\nOr maybe she took a psych course and fell in love with the subject and believes she\u2019ll find that more fulfilling than CS?\n\nYou seem determined to see the worst in everything your daughter does. If you dislike her so much, why are you worried about whether it\u2019d be an asshole move to break your promise to her?", "No, she isn't. She discovered she didn't like what she went for so decided to go into something she likes better. Many college students change their major after the first year. Stop being so judgmental of your child and actually help her. Jesus. I feel so sorry for your daughter, growing up with tou as a mother must have been so miserable.", "I was undecided, changed majors halfway through, switched careers in my mid twenties, and now I\u2019m about to finish medical school. I\u2019m so glad my parents gave me the space to grow while still supporting all of my decisions, or I truly wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. YTA, big time.", "I've changed majors three times now and am about to change for the fourth and final time. (finally found what I love btw, which I couldn't have done if I just picked a major and stuck with it like you seem to expect). Do you know how many classes I took in my first two years of college, which will end this semester, that won't count towards my degree? 2. I took 2 classes in 2 years that won't count towards my degree, after switching majors four times. The only reason those won't count is because I took them knowing they wouldn't but to take a class in the majors I was considering and see how I felt. She's not wasting time she's doing what most people in college do, but you didn't go to college so you wouldn't know.", "You fail to understand that studying for a degree is not just about learning about that specific subject, as such. It is also about the process of learning. While some fields require specific degrees, i.e. medicine, many employers understand that a degree indicates the character and capacity of a person who can add value to their business. So often the actual degree subject doesn't matter. So to say that the process of achieving a degree is a waste of time is ignorant. Psychology is a useful degree to have in any field that involves dealing with people.", "Yeah, and he approved the one he she picked like he could afford it.", "That is asinine she would not be working and going to school if OP didn\u2019t screw her over and lie, she\u2019d be in school if OP did what they said they would and could do but are not doing", "There is no school that everyone can afford.", "do you not realize that she would likely have to keep paying rent if she moved out mid lease tho? most college area apartments have contracts made my the devil himself-nearly impossible to leave without reason (aka company not following agreement) and not still pay rent on the remainder of the lease.", "By everyone I meant them lol", "That\u2019s a fair point. Don\u2019t have info on that", "He tried to fulfill that promise but situations changed. Either way the post is not about that per se, but the current situation. And I think his daughter does need to take action", "Daughter needs to realize the value of dad's word and realize that, ready or not, she's flown the nest.\n\nDad needs to realize that, if he doesn't change his parenting style, he'll never see his grandkids", "His situation did NOT change. He says he's got the cash, but refuses to part with it"]}
