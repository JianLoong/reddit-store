The school she picked ended up being too expensive and none of the (private) loans would go through to pay for school (it\u2019s based on her credit and mines) and her federal loans wouldn\u2019t cover enough of it either. She was unable to go back to school for sophomore year as she didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for it. She says she\u2019s been working on trying to transfer to a cheaper school but it\u2019s been almost 2 whole semesters and she\u2019s still not back in school. I had co-signed her lease in august of 2022 thinking she was going back to school and obviously needed housing for it, but she hasn\u2019t been in school for almost 2 semesters and I don\u2019t feel like I should have to pay for her housing anymore because of that. She works 40 hours a week now at some random job in the city and she pays for all her utilities but for some reason still doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay her own rent ($1250 a month) She offered to help pay a portion of her rent but she needs to be in school and not wasting her time. Why should I have to pay for her housing if she\u2019s not even in school? It was her decision to move out of the house and go to this random city for school and school only. If she\u2019s not going to school then i\u2019m not going to pay her rent. If she wants to live out there then she\u2019s old enough to pay for that herself. \nI am a small business owner and my company is worth almost 2 million, so I can afford to pay for it but, I also have 2 other kids to take care of and another one on the way. I didn\u2019t go to college and I didn\u2019t have any help growing up and I had to figure everything out on my own, so if she doesn\u2019t go back to school I should essentially drop her and she\u2019s just going to have to figure out everything on her own.

You promised to pay for her education and the extra expenses. She dropped out not bc of lack of interest or because she was partying too hard, but because you didn't follow through on your end and she couldn't afford tuition by herself. What other recourse does she have but to work full time to try and be able to afford it? Seems like something a pull yourself up by your bootstraps lady like yourself would appreciate. But you seem upset with her for doing so and consider it a waste of time, and annoyed at her not being able to afford rent and tuition simulatenously. This is not something that's going to improve without help, at least not in the short term. If she can't afford rent, how do you think she is doing with saving substantial amounts to be put toward her education?

While you shouldn't pay her expenses forever, you need to at least wait till the lease is up to find another college or a cheaper place to live although I doubt she'll find a cheaper place, let her KNOW she has till the lease is up and go from there.

She understood and made her decision accordingly. Now she's about to graduate, with no loans for her or us. Those are conversations  you should have had, especially since she's likely not eligible for aid based on your income/assets.

The guidance counselor from her high school could have even helped you & her on the college process they even have this neat ability to help match students to colleges and universities to apply to based on budget, need of financial assistance, how close or far they\u2019re willing to be from whatever home/living situation left and that\u2019s just the surface. \n\nShe\u2019s damned if she doesn\u2019t damned if she doesn\u2019t with you. \n\n1) \u201cI told her I would pay for everything\u201d whoa it\u2019s was more expensive than what I thought and that falls on me as the parent for not looking further into what to expect before offering what I\u2019d be willing to do.

My daughter learned the school she attended is way more expensive than I thought and I don\u2019t have money to cover it, alternate financial avenues won\u2019t cover it or approve certain loans for it. Realizing now at a young age she\u2019s decided to transfer because it\u2019s more cost effective. While trying to get the transfer process going she got a full time job. Depending on the job there\u2019s a big pay scale gap between degree and non-degree earners. She\u2019s probably making a little more than minimum wage but she also isn\u2019t making a livable wage. She offered to pay a portion of rent and that got shot down. Now you want to stop paying her apartment rent because she needs to learn the way I did.\n\nIf this is your mentality, I can see why she\u2019s choosing to not come home. Poor girl can\u2019t win, she found a very doable solution for her immediate need of earning money while trying to sort out her transfer situation then you\u2019re basically telling her what she is currently doing isn\u2019t acceptable and she needs to get back in school, yet you can\u2019t afford the school and the alternate methods you were relying on failed. \n\nShe seems to have a good head on her shoulders and I have an inkling that she isn\u2019t keeping you up to date on her situation because you\u2019re too obtuse to understand there\u2019s multiple solutions to this problem (one which she\u2019s already found) but since it isn\u2019t your way, you\u2019re sending her off on the highway. \n\nSince you have another child on the way I\u2019d recommend speaking to financial planner or at the minimum getting financial guidance so your other children at least have a much clearer picture of what they\u2019d be working with finance wise on what you \u201cdecide to support them with\u201d unfairly your daughter is having to be your Guinea pig with all of this. \n\nHow as a parent can you \u201cdecide to support\u201d your child on something and not do even the most basic of research to see what you (or they) are getting into, potential things of what you or they could be applying for, signing or legally agreeing to? \n\n\nYou\u2019re failing to see the common denominator in this problem is you. \n\nJust a little statistic for you, according to the national center for educational statistics 80% of college students change their major once. On average, college students change their major at least three times over the course of their college career. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do as her next major, she really is doing herself a huge favor wether realizing it or not, she\u2019s not wasting money on classes that won\u2019t apply to what she switches her major too. If she has to take out different types of loans, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s wanting to wait to make sure she really wants to do whatever major she chooses next versus wasting money on classes that won\u2019t transfer or count as credit towards her major.\n\nEdited to add judgement.", "This is how you create food insecurity and scarcity mindset", "\\> She\u2019ll thank me later.\n\nFor what?

You claim she\u2019s an adult, treat her with some respect.", "Yeah, YTA massively. \n\nHer rent is $1250, which is exactly the same as mine. However, I have a B.S. in engineering and an Engineer in Training Certificate. I make $37.50/hour. I can afford my rent and save some money, but I also have credit card debt that I\u2019m working on slowly paying down because I\u2019ve only had this job for about 9 months (graduated last year). Also, my mom still pays my car insurance. And, I live in a relatively affordable city, so I pay a lot less on food, drink, parking, and entertainment than a lot of my peers who live in more expensive cities. \n\nLet me do some math for you, since you apparently can\u2019t be bothered to ever actually think about the details of your daughters financial situation. As a 20 year old with no college degree, she\u2019s almost definitely making minimum wage. Maybe just above that. I don\u2019t know where you live, but I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the minimum wage where you are is $15/hour, though it could be much lower. Of course, if the minimum wage is that high, it\u2019s likely the overall cost of living is also high in that area - cost of living factors in much more than just rent.\n\n$15/hr x 40 hrs = $600/week. \n$600x52 = $31,200 = annual income\nAnnual Rent = $1250 x 12 = $15000\n\nSo right off the bat, her annual rent is just barely less than half of her annual income.\nMost apartments will not even approve you as a tenant if you make less than 3x your rent. Obviously, the only reason she has this apartment in the first place is because you were paying for it. How on earth could you expect her to just suddenly afford that rent herself?\n\nHere\u2019s a little more math, for fun.\n\nLet\u2019s be generous and assume she\u2019s pretty energy efficient and her apartment is well-insulated. So maybe she pays $100/month in utilities, including gas, water, electricity. Could be a bit less but could also definitely be more. That\u2019s an additional $1200/year. If she\u2019s also paying rent, she now has just $15000 per year for everything else.\n\nFood ALONE can cost about $100/week, if she\u2019s good at meal planning and cooking. She\u2019s 20 years old - meal planning on a budget is a skill that takes most people a long time to learn, and somehow I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve helped her with that. So shes spending AT LEAST \n$400/month x 12 = $4800\n\nnow we\u2019re down to $11200 per year. \nDoes she drive a car? if so, does she pay her insurance? gas? gas of course can vary, and the cost of public transportation/ubers can too, but let\u2019s just assume $50/month for transportation. that\u2019s probably a huge underestimate.\n$50/month x 12 = $600/year\n\nWe\u2019re down to $10600.\n\nPlease find me a school that costs less than that in annual tuition + fees. \n\nEven if you can, you are expecting your daughter to live an extremely frugal life with this budget. I\u2019ve added up the bare essentials. She would never go out to eat with her friends, or go to the movies, or get a coffee every once in a while\u2026 yes, these are \u201cluxuries\u201d, and many people don\u2019t have the option to enjoy them, but you have said you can afford to be helping her out, so she is not one of those people.

YTA", "You need to tell her NOW that when the lease is up you are not going to renew it and she needs to make a plan on how she will live.

It\u2019s that simple.", "Yeah, YTA massively. \n\nHer rent is $1250, which is exactly the same as mine. However, I have a B.S. in engineering and an Engineer in Training Certificate. I make $37.50/hour. I can afford my rent and save some money, but I also have credit card debt that I\u2019m working on slowly paying down because I\u2019ve only had this job for about 9 months (graduated last year). Also, my mom still pays my car insurance. And, I live in a relatively affordable city, so I pay a lot less on food, drink, parking, and entertainment than a lot of my peers who live in more expensive cities. \n\nLet me do some math for you, since you apparently can\u2019t be bothered to ever actually think about the details of your daughters financial situation. As a 20 year old with no college degree, she\u2019s almost definitely making minimum wage. Maybe just above that. I don\u2019t know where you live, but I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the minimum wage where you are is $15/hour, though it could be much lower. Of course, if the minimum wage is that high, it\u2019s likely the overall cost of living is also high in that area - cost of living factors in much more than just rent.\n\n$15/hr x 40 hrs = $600/week. \n$600x52 = $31,200 = annual income\nshe\u2019s getting taxed on that. I don\u2019t know what the tax is where you are but let\u2019s be generous and take out 10%\nsure, she might get some or all of that back in her tax return, but that doesn\u2019t help pay immediate expenses before that. \nSo her effective annual income is $28000.\n\nAnnual Rent = $1250 x 12 = $15000\n\nSo right off the bat, her annual rent is just barely half of her annual income, and more than half of what she has available to spend. \nMost apartments will not even approve you as a tenant if you make less than 3x your rent. Obviously, the only reason she has this apartment in the first place is because you were paying for it. How on earth could you expect her to just suddenly afford that rent herself?\n\nHere\u2019s a little more math, for fun.\n\nLet\u2019s be generous and assume she\u2019s pretty energy efficient and her apartment is well-insulated. So maybe she pays $100/month in utilities, including gas, water, electricity. Could be a bit less but could also definitely be more. That\u2019s an additional $1200/year. If she\u2019s also paying rent, she now has just $11800 per year for everything else.\n\nFood ALONE can cost about $100/week, if she\u2019s good at meal planning and cooking. She\u2019s 20 years old - meal planning on a budget is a skill that takes most people a long time to learn, and somehow I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve helped her with that. So shes spending AT LEAST \n$400/month x 12 = $4800\n\nnow we\u2019re down to $7000 per year. \nDoes she drive a car? if so, does she pay her insurance? gas? gas of course can vary, and the cost of public transportation/ubers can too, but let\u2019s just assume $50/month for transportation. that\u2019s probably a huge underestimate.\n$50/month x 12 = $600/year\n\nWe\u2019re down to $6400.\n\nDo you pay her medical expenses? All of them? Let\u2019s hope you do, or let\u2019s hope she never has any accidents or emergencies ever. \n\nPlease find me a school that costs less than $6400 in annual tuition + fees.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Like, public universities and colleges are cheaper than private school, but a prestigious private college or university, like an Ivy League, is way more likely to have a larger endowment that can contribute to more income-based financial aid and sometimes be cheaper in the long-run because they can provide more grants to students. Basically, the price tag for tuition does not always translate to amount that a student will ultimately owe at the time of payment and/or the amount that the student should need to pay back.\n\nPlus, if you intend to go to graduate school, the prestige of your undergraduate college is less important than the prestige of your graduate program, so saving money on undergraduate college and university makes a lot of sense there.\n\nAnd as others have pointed out, that doesn\u2019t get into the financial calculus of one\u2019s career path and likely income (and lifetime ability to pay back student loans).\n\nIt\u2019s why OP\u2019s handling of the situation is so frustrating.

I got into a lower level school that would have given me a full ride due to academics, but I would have hated it there, I think, based on non-cost factors. Same for the state college that was substantially cheaper than the private ones without the full ride. So I went to a very good, but not great, academic school that offered me decent scholarships and aid, but not as cheap as the other two (full ride and public).  It ended up not being the best choice for me either, because working a lot while trying to go to school full time is rough, so maybe I should have gone to the cheaper ones, but oh well, it worked out for the most part.", "What? \n\n\"If my parent's don't give me money, then they don't love me.\" \n\nUnconditional support does not include financial support once you are an adult.", "IT's a debt system, education is supposed to get you into debt.

This combined with shit like education coming out of local taxes so poor areas have poorly funded schools with higher numbers of people living there (much denser population areas) while people in rich areas have way more money in their schools with far less people so they get far better educations which makes it far easier to get into college and they have the money to afford it.\n\nThe system is rigged.", "Here, you seemed to have gotten a few of the words in your title wrong, I fixed it for you: \u201cAITA for lying to my daughter about being able to financially support her through college and setting her up for failure, and then judging her for how she deals with my own ineptitude as a parent and support system?\u201d YTA.", "Just because the business is worth 2 million doesn\u2019t mean he has extra money laying around. 2 million isn\u2019t even that much when it comes to evaluating a business.
