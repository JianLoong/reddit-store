He has 2 kids 8 and 2 and I have 1 8 yo  in heart failure. These children are from previous relationships.  My 8 year old was born with congenital heart defect and I have always had to be very careful with him. Currently my child is on a heart transplant list the last year and a half. He has a IV 24/7  pumping meds to his heart and has to take blood thinner shots. All the children have other parents we coparent with. He has his kids half the time and I have my child 99% of the time. When I moved in with partner it was a discuss. that if his children were sick they would stay at their other parents to keep my child healthy and ready for a heart. \n Since we moved in his children have been sick many times. His 8 year old has stayed at her moms house from sickness maybe 2x and since she knows she wouldn\u2019t be able to come to our home now has started to lie about not being sick because she wants to be with us. \nNow the Friday before Christmas the 8 year old came home from a road trip she took with her other parent and sounded very horse, bloodshot eyes, coughing, sneezing and congested. I asked her if she was sick and she said no. My partner left after dropping her off. I called him and told him she was sick. He blew me off and said it was probably from being in the car. I knew better and it became a argument bcus 1 she was sick 2 we had a agreement and he wasn\u2019t sticking to it and 3 I am praying to God that we might get a heart this week since we are so high on the list and other kids are sick or traveling so they are what\u2019s called Status 7 which means they are not getting a call if a heart becomes available.  Finally my partner and me calmed down and he said the kids immediately were already side by side and was no point of pulling them apart now. I was still upset and worried and just tried to keep cleaning and do Xmas activities.  \nXmas came and he dropped off the 8 year old and picked up his 2 year old. I went into the living room to see him and he was on the floor with my son coughing in his face and looked very sick! I turned to my partner and said \u201cHe is sick\u201d and he tried to play it off like no he just woke up from a nap and its cold outside. My mommy instincts knew better. I had my child sit next to me and not play with the two year and I texted my partner asking is he could go back him to his mom after opening his presents since he is sick and He refused and said I was crazy. Since we have moved in together he always has some sort of excuse like \u201callergies\u201d or \u201ctheir parents went out of town\u201d which are usually lies. \nI told my partner we are done. After children receive their heart transplants, they have 0 immune systems and can easily be hospitalized or worse. I do not think it\u2019s fair for my child to have to be on a IV all the time, take shots daily, not be able to live a normal life and he risks him getting sick which could stop his chance of receiving a heart if one comes.

In addition your partner loses the chance to see his kids if they are sick, most recently during the holiday season.

And even more so when they know the importance of the situation.\n\nYou're trashing OP because she trusted adult men to make adult decisions?  \nAnd when she saw they didn't she decided to get away. It seems like she made the right choice, even if it could have happened sooner.", "And not to the point, but she's been with him for 3 years and he has a 2 year old with someone else. Unless they're in an open relationship, he's a cheater--either with her or on her. Not someone who's on the up and up.", "This is not it. Way to blame the mother.", "How do people deal with this with more than one child? Seems like children with transplants would have siblings. Weird that they can\u2019t figure this out.", "OP said in another comment that the mom agreed.", "Good luck with your child getting the transplant. I hope all goes well for you. I lost my little girl at one day old (she arrived at 29 weeks)and I would never want anyone to have to go through that. I have my fingers crossed for you both", "Then you need to either stop dating single parents or accept you can't live with an SO until your child is stronger.", "But what would you do? Let\u2019s say hypothetically the one with the heart condition was your second child. How would you navigate that?", "This just was never realistic.  \n\nKids get sick.  That age, they keep colds.  So he was just supposed to drop off his kid whenever they got the sniffles?  What if mom couldn't keep them becuase it wasn't her week?  Then what?", "Seems like this was a rushed decision to move in together otherwise she probably would have know his kids were like this", "Sure, she's not stopping any of it, only complains whenever it happens.\n\nThe partner and kids have done it multiple times, op said so, and she only 'has the talk' with him. Instead of breaking off the relationship or simply not living together. So yes, op is to blame too", "Sure, they do.  They likely limit how much contact the kids have outside of school with other kids, and all sorts of things.  But that isn't really fair to put on his kids either.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "It doesn't matter because she tied her tubes \n\nShould we also ask what she'd do if she became a superhero and could fly and shoot lazer beams?", "It's too much to ask. She puts her kid first, but he puts his first too.", "Perhaps, but that's a honest mistake. And I don't think a honest mistake makes someone an AH.", "It absolutely matters. Because whatever she would do in that situation is what she should do now. Her child will be on immunity suppressing drugs for the rest of his life if gets the transplant so his body doesn\u2019t reject the heart. \n\nShe wants him to treat his own kids like second class citizens. It certainly matters here what she would do if they were all her biological kids. Has she even looked into what other families have done?\n\nEdit - but if I had to make a judgement, it would be NAH if they\u2019re not married. It was a bad and poorly thought out plan from the start and they both want to do what\u2019s best for their children and neither should have to give up time with their young kids for the sake of their partner. Parting ways would be best for all parties.", "It's a good question. because some children who need a heart plant obviously live with siblings and somehow they manage the illness factor.", ">Proctologist \n\nI do not treat his children as \"second class citizens\" Me and SO spoke with the other parents and THEY AGREED to watch their children when they were sick to keep us all safe and healthy and we spoke to SO parents and they agreed as well to keep the kids when they are sick. This was a agreement between ALL parties prior to moving in. SO is just not doing what he said he was going to do, he is not asking his parents for help, and he doesn't have the children go back to their other parents. Unfortunately for me, I have no parents, I have no family, hence why I tied my tubes because I knew I wouldn't have help and didn't want to put myself in a situation like that. I have I guess in a round about way, unaware of the backlash and broken promises.", "You are treating them as second class citizens if you want to boot them out of THEIR home because they have a case of the sniffles. You moved in with him, not the other way around.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by leaving. It was an awful plan to begin with.", "It's easy for people to say they'll help out, because it makes them feel like a good person.  They're helping an ill child. But when the rubber meets the road they don't actually pull through.\n\nIt's really unfortunate. His kids could learn a valuable lesson about caring for other people when you're part of a family. The other parent, the grandparents have an opportunity to do something meaningful in a child's life. \n\nIf you lived closer to me I would help."]}
