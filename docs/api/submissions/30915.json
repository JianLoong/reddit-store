In my 20s I was attractive and yet also very shy and anxious with depression so I feel you. \n\nBottom line is that what he said was out of line and it isn\u2019t your issue any longer. \n\nThe former friend in question may have never experienced depression or maybe he does and can\u2019t fathom why you would - either way, it\u2019s OK to disagree with someone and want to no longer speak with them. \n\nAlso, depression isn\u2019t something to \u201cparade\u201d around lol. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s debilitating. It feels like you can\u2019t get out. Look up the attractiveness bias in medical care. It\u2019s a real thing. Make sure you advocate for yourself and your own healthcare as well. \n\nYou don\u2019t need that noise in your life.", "NTA. As a woman with depression, i hate him. His words was so wrong and he thought he was going somewhere. I\u2019m glad you blocked him and had him gone from your life forever.", "Nta\nHe was doing several sexisms", "NTA. His behavior and rationale was totally unacceptable. He even tried to gaslight you \"you must have just not understood\" ... This isn't mental health olympics. He doesn't have to minimize someone else's struggles so his struggle is worse. That's .. just bonkers. \n\nConsidering your struggles, that you wrote about here, I think you did the right thing to block him and presumably, remove him from your life. You don't need people in your life to tell you that you don't have issues. You need people that provide passive or active emotional support when you need it or are just a stable presence that you can rely on (be your safe harbor in stormy times). A person (man) that tells you that your mental health issues will be fixed if you have sex/relationship with a man is just ... not grown enough to understand what mental health is or what a healthy relationship with yourself or another person is.", "NTA. Ditch the friend who is both ugly on the inside and outside. People who want to compete in the struggle Olympics are never worth it. Dismissing your problems and saying their issues are bigger or more valid gets exhausting. Save your energy and get the help you need.", "What? So just because you look nice you can't get mental health issues? It really is not as shallow as that. It can happen to everyone, as you correctly explained to him. And comparing men vs women's issues gets no one anywhere.. there are different issues for everyone dealing with them.\n\nExtra weird as you were not even talking about relationships.

Yes, woman can get it easier but that does not mean its love, and, in some cases, it can make you feel even worse.

What an utter tool. \nBecause you\u2019re attractive you can\u2019t have depression?!?\nI\u2019m happily married, like my job and my friends and my life most of the time and yet I\u2019ve been diagnosed with severe depression and gad since my early teens.  And when it hits and rolls over me - it\u2019s a freaking nightmare and no amount of but you\u2019re attractive will save me. I have to ride it out. Thankfully I\u2019ve stopped trying to erase myself- I used to say I\u2019m such a failure I even fail at that!

And I (an internet stranger) is rooting for you!  \nLike seriously now - I\u2019m rooting for you! You are trying everyday and making tiny steps forward and even if it takes a lifetime or you go back a few steps or stop entirely- you\u2019ve still crushed it. Each sunrise you see is you crushing life and I\u2019m so bloody chuffed for you. \n\nAlso he\u2019s a tosspot.", "NTA but he sure is. Some of what you quote sounds almost as if he is an incel or absorbing the garbage that they spew out. You did right to block him.", "I don't know if that makes me a bad person, but I laughed at the part that \"men's depression is much worse\". I didn't know it was a competition!

I knew that would be the judgement just from reading the title.", "Yeah that kind of incel bullshit should be blocked everywhere .\n\nIgnore and live your life.", "Both you you are aholes but yta in particular for trying to gatekeeper depression as a medical diagnosis only if it stems from nowhere.

I'm surprised I don't see more comments recognizing that. Two mentally ill people arguing with each other. They both need help. Sounds like both are crying for help in their own way.", "ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s not a contest.  Each of you is unempathetically viewing mental illness through the lense of your own conditions and misery and discounting the other person\u2019s experience and challenges.\n\nGross. \n\nHe started it, sure.
