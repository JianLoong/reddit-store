It just depends on whether you can locally walk in & request a copy, or if you have to have it sent to you.

Didn\u2019t vacuum the floor correctly? Did you not have the lines all running in one direction. Left footprints and didn\u2019t run the vacuum back over it. You ruined his marriage to your mom step mom? Outburst like that lead me to say he likely lost his temper and the gal he was with could sense it was only the beginning.
