It's never been your fault, it's always been his fault.  \n\nHe has a very odd and incorrect way of trying to keep you from making the same mistakes he did.  But deep down I truly believe that is his intent.  When you said you were moving out, it shocked him to the core..... \n\nI hope you can move out and live a full life.  You certainly don't need his toxicity around.  That being said, he does love you and he will be there if you need him.  (Again, I truly believe this based on his reaction).", "NTA How shocking for him to realize his daughter is intelligent enough to recognize an asshole when she sees one.", "NTA ... this is not the treatment a father should offer his daughter.  \n\nOne thing does stick out at me, though.  You'd said father was surprised when you said you wanted to move out.  Could it be that he -- somehow -- doesn't realize how hurtful his words are?  While it's still smart for you to move out, I think there may be something to salvage from all this mess.  Recommend you take your old man aside and talk about how the way he yells at you really hurts your feelings; see how he reacts.", "NTA\n\nyour dad was 14 when he knocked up your mom\n\nnot your fault he's a dumbass", "Your father was hurt? After what he said to you? NTA\u2026 but he is. You should talk, because this situation\u2019s toxic. Is it a typo when you wrote that he\u2019s 31? Where\u2019s your mom? Is she who he\u2019s married to?", "Fathers never grow up my dad is just like yours for my entire life, leave him and never look back", "NTA! he looked hurt? please, care about his feelings as much as he seems to about yours - zilch!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is abusive. I'm so sorry, and hope you can get out of there as fast as possible.", "If you're not there for him to blame for his problems, he'd have to blame himself. He doesn't like that. NTA", "NTA - by \u201cruined his marriage\u201d does that mean your parents are divorced?\n\nIt kind of sounds like your father went quiet when you told him you\u2019d be leaving at 18 because he realized he just lost another \u2018loved\u2019 one due to his abusive behavior. Haha", "NTA. Your dad is abusive and I\u2019d get out even sooner if you can.", "NTA, he is abusive and wishes you gone. So, you're simply fulfilling his wish.\n\nGet all your documents and once you have a place, move things out slowly. Move necessary paperwork first", "A child having a child. That's the first problem.", "Yeah... she ruined his marriage to a woman who was not her bio mom. (Therefore her birth) OP confirmed this in other comments but I didn't think it was this hard to piece together either.", "In a comment OP says, her bio mom left when she was little, her step mom left a year ago. \n\nAnd she responded to a comment where they say the dad was 14 and she did not correct them. So I think it's a good assumption that parents were 14 when she was born and her mom dipped out. The wife he is talking about is not her bio mom.", "My bio mother left and my step mom left a year ago.", "My bio mother left and my step mom left a year ago.", "Well, my bio mother left, and my step mom left a year ago.", "I knew a girl in school who had a kid damn near every year she could starting in 8th grade, she still graduated though.   I can't even imagine graduating with a handful of kids", "I think many people already told you that you need to get a hold of your important documents. I would add that you also need to close your room at night, get your own keys and maybe get ready to defend yourself when things get violent. He knows now that time is running out before you are out, and that could make him even more crazy. \n\nAlso you should spent more and more nights at your friends place. \n\nHow long till you 18?", "The age difference makes MORE sense in this case.  So often do I see folks I grew up with that had kids early and it kind of stunted their emotional growth.  Like you\u2019d think it would make them grow up faster but it sometimes just does the exact opposite.  I have friends who\u2019s parents had them young and some of these parents are the most self-centered folks I\u2019ve ever met.", "But apparently, your assumptions are everyone's rule.", "I turn 18 on September 6th", "I was a teen parent and managed very well and my now adult children are amazing.", "LOL", "Just an FYI, I just loaded the page for the first time a little bit ago and it still says 31 for me.", "I just got here and it says 31.", "That your mom had a kid and got married at 14 does not make it any less odd or problematic.", "It's projection of himself/her mother.  He's pissed that he ruined his life by having a child so young."]}
