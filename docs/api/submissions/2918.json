Your OCD tendencies aside, there is no point in keeping toys around that your kid has outgrown or has never shown much interest in (unless you want to keep it in storage for a future kid). As your kid gets older, this will happen again and again. There's no way to reduce clutter without getting rid of stuff!", "I would have told her that you donated it. She probably thinks you are taking a gift for him, selling it, then keeping the money for yourself, ie, stealing his gift. Maybe tell her that you are putting the money you sold it for into a college fund?", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, it was a gift. You could have turned around and sold it the same day you got it, and MIL*still* wouldn't be entitled to one cent. \n\nSecondly, at 3 years old, your son is much too old for those bouncy chairs. Just how long does MIL expect you to keep hanging on to something your son no longer uses?!\n\nKeep the money.", "NTA.\n\nNo, you don't owe her money. If she had gotten you a new car, you used it for a while, then decided to sell it and buy another one, would you pay her the money? No. Gifts are gifts. Once a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient, to do whatever they please with it.\n\nAs a side note, I'm happy you're in therapy. If you have issues with clutter, having a baby is going to aggravate this issue.", "NTA. Parents accumulate so much shit the first few years from relatives/grandparents for their kids. If she wanted the toy to be appreciated and used, she should have bought something from your recommendations. Likewise, it\u2019s a gift. She chose to give it and cannot demand the money she spent back.\n\nGoing forward, I would let her know that your kid doesn\u2019t need more toys/gifts are not necessary but if she would like to buy your son XYZ, it would be appreciated.", "NTA you are not required to be thankful for gifts you specifically said you didn't want.", "NTA. A gift belongs to you once you receive it. If you choose to sell it then the money is yours to keep.  She won\u2019t learn from this if you give her the money.", "NTA.  That gift belonged to you and your husband.   You were free to sell it if you wanted to.  Tell MIL if she gives a gift it doesn't belong to her anymore.", "NTA. When we gift something to someone, it's no longer ours. The recipient can do what they like with it, including selling it.\n\nEven if you didn't have OCD, it makes sense to sell something you no longer need. It's why we have second-hand shops in the first place.", "You are not obligated to repay someone for a gift they gave you.\n\nKids get gifts they won't use all the time.  It's better it go to someone who will use it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your home, your child, your rules.  Plus, the recipient is always free to do whatever they choose to do with a gift.  The fact that your MIL is incapable of understanding the definition of a such a basic word is not your problem.\n\nYour problem is your husband.  Wanting you to give her money in order \u201cto keep the peace\u201d - excuse me?  No, I\u2019m sorry but HIS mother is completely out of line and HE needs to shut her down.  \n\nIt\u2019s your house, your child, your rules.  He needs to make that crystal clear to his mother and that HER opinions have absolutely zero weight in your home.  So what if she gets upset\u2014her feelings are her own to manage, not yours and not your husbands.", "NTA\n\nShe gave you a gift. Also people who give baby gifts should know that babies outgrow their stuff and parents are going to either give them away or sell them at some point.", "As a mom to a baby under one NTA. I am giving away big ticket items to friends who are pregnant to get rid of big things. I cannot wait until the electric swing is out because my babe's been too big for it for months. It doesn't serve your child to keep things below their developmental level. Ask your MIL if she doesn't want your child to grown and learn. Also  sorry, if someone gives you a gift, what they do with that gift is up to them. That includes selling it. But lean in on the don't you want child to grow? Do you want to stunt their mental growth???", "NTA. With or without OCD, it is your prerogative as the parent to decide what toys stay in your home. A gift is exactly that \u2014 your MIL loses claim to these items the moment she gifts them to you. \n\nI\u2019m hardcore about my boundaries regarding my kid. If someone trampled that boundary over and over, I would just stop engaging with that person completely. Your MIL is lucky you love your husband enough to entertain her.\n\nEdited to add: if your husband has a habit of caving to what his mom wants, you don\u2019t have a MIL problem you actually have a husband problem.", "NTA. it was a gift, you had it for a while and your kid didn\u2019t use it. You don\u2019t owe her the money for a gift.", "NTA. Forget keeping the peace. MIL is a boundary-stomper and is only upset that you didn't keep something she bought. A gift is yours to do with what you will. As long as you use the money you received for selling towards the baby, MIL needs to get over it.", "NTA\n\nIt was a gift, especially one you told her you didn't want. When someone gives you a gift, they are no longer entitled to it.\n\nYou should not have to give the money back. Your husband needs to grow up and stand up to his mom. You have told her what was acceptable to buy, and she refuses to listen and do what she wants. He needs to stand his ground against her and stop giving in to her.\n\nMy suggestion is to take the money and buy something your child needs. And when she comes over with unwanted gifts, simply tell her to take them back, or you will once again sell it. She has a choice to either listen or watch you sell it and buy things the child actually likes and needs. \n\nIt is so disgusting seeing all these men just give in to their mothers, just to keep the peace, and allow their mothers to act that way and get away with it. Why do they do that?", "She is trying to exert dominance with this stuff. Give her the money and tell her the next such item will be thrown away.\n\nSee r/JUSTNOMIL", "NTA for selling the toy but definitely YTA for insulting the quality of the gift. It sounds like there is a lot of tension in your relationship with your MIL.", "NTA but I do think you could maybe be more aware of how something like that comes across. Gifting is a sensitive topic for a lot of people, especially when they feel like they're providing for their family, and a lot of people feel hurt or offended when people sell or throw away gifts.\n\nPersonally I think you had a good reason and you made the right choice, but I do think it's worth recognising that this is a bit of a social faux pas to some people, and may have come across as a deliberate snub to your MIL. It might be true that your MIL has committed her own social faux pas by giving you unwanted gifts, but I don't think fighting fire with fire is really the approach you want for building a family.\n\nAssuming you want your MIL in your life and want to make amends, I think you really need to sit down and talk about this. Acknowledge her hurt feelings, but make sure she acknowledges yours too. Really work out what went wrong here and how it can be avoided in the future, together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
