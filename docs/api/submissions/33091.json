{"id": 33091, "submission_id": "18jbm9w", "title": "WIBTA to let my daughter stay home for the holiday season after she betrayed her sister?", "selftext": "I have two daughters - A (22F) & D (20F). I am 45F (mom). \n\nMy daughter A had been with her boyfriend, L, since she was 18. \n\nIt came out just last week that D had been having an affair with L over the last 6 months or so. This was discovered by A finding messages on D\u2019s iPad of all places and it all came out. Apparently they met once a month or so. \n\nWe have met L, he has been to our house several times. \n\nBoth of my girls have been home for the holidays - A usually lives out. Obviously A has been extremely upset. D has been profusely apologising and attempting to explain herself and stated that nothing has happened between them for over a month and that it was a mistake. \n\nHere comes my issue. Of course I am EXTREMELY angry at what a selfish, disgusting thing D did to her own sister. I can understand why A never wants to speak to D again and how betrayed she feels. \n\nHowever, and I think perhaps other parents will understand this, D is still my daughter. She is very young, immature and seems hugely regretful of her mistake. She also lives at home with us, while A lives out most of the year at college. \n\nA is insisting that I kick D out of the house and ban her from holiday celebrations. This year we are planning to have all extended family stay with us through the festive period, and this has already been planned. However, A has said if I don\u2019t exclude D from the house, she will be leaving and won\u2019t return. Financially, she relies on us so I am not sure how this will work for her. \n(ETA for clarity: I would absolutely continue to support her in every way including financially - I only mentioned this as she threatened walking out on us and having nothing to do with us ever again, despite the above, which made me question it.)\n\nD has been staying with a friend since this all happened as A is threatening to leave and I wanted to communicate that we were supporting her. However, D had been asking to come back and I would like her to prior to the festivities. \n\nWIBTA to do this? Please bear in mind that D would not have a place to go to if we kicked her out, and she is only 20. We could afford to put her up somewhere but that doesn\u2019t seem like a long term plan. It would also be sad to exclude her from the holiday festivities and would no doubt attract a lot of questions from friends and family. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not just the holidays though that is an immediate concern - how long would I have to keep her out for? It can\u2019t go on indefinitely. \n\nOn the other hand I am worried I will lose A forever, which she has threatened, if I do this. \n\n**TLDR:** My youngest daughter had a physical affair with her sisters boyfriend. The eldest is threatening to leave if I don\u2019t kick the younger one or for the holidays and beyond, which I am reluctant to do.", "created_utc": 1702677958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jbm9w/wibta_to_let_my_daughter_stay_home_for_the/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And that that is a fair and reasonable response to her betrayal.\n\nAnd that one of the best ways she could truly show she is remorseful is to clear out for Christmas (if there is somewhere she can stay) and allow A the support of her extended family right now.\n\nYTA if you weren\u2019t at least going to have that conversation, regardless of outcome.\n\nAt the very least, if you do welcome D back (because there\u2019s nowhere else for her to stay), you should help A find somewhere else to stay and cover her costs if you can.\n\nAnd you have to accept that, whatever happens next, one of your daughters will not be spending Christmas with you this year and there will be ongoing ramifications. And know that your family will find out.\n\nThis situation sucks - sorry, OP, but make sure that whatever happens, A feels your support of her and condemnation of D. This post feels like you\u2019re minimising D\u2019s actions and trying to paper over it just a week after it coming to light and that\u2019s simply not going to happen. And shouldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd make sure they both get tested.", "Y T A Don't minimize D's actions she's not 5 yrs old she's 20, she knew what she was doing and getting involved with your sister's boyfriend is not something that \"just happen\".\nThink about how A feels she's the victim no D", "Seriously you have to ask.  Your daughter was cheated on by her bf and sister.  Her mother doesn't know who to defend.  Put yourself in your daughter's position how would you feel? \n\n Your daughter knew there was a possibility she would get caught so about time she dealt with the consequences of her actions.", "As this is all so recent and raw; maybe D shouldn't be allowed home for this Christmas. This of course is a short term solution. But at this point, i think A needs you more and D should have to face the consequences of her despicable actions. Her own sister. Facepalm.\n\nWhen things have cooled; you can work on a rapprochement between the sisters. YTA if you let D come home", "YTA\n\nYour daughter cheated with her sisters boyfriend OF FOUR YEARS!!! \n\nCheating regardless is disgusting, but it\u2019s even more despicable given they were together so long. A was probably imagining marrying her bf and him and D just wrecked her life.\n\nYou need to support A, and tell D that she needs to know the consequences of her actions and that is that she\u2019s now officially broken your family for good.\n\nYou need to understand that A will NEVER EVER FORGIVE D. And you know what, that\u2019s her right. I know it probably feels awful, and one day you\u2019re probably going to want to ask A to forgive her sister- but if you do that would be so so so wrong and you\u2019ll be an awful parent, and A will cut you off. Don\u2019t go down that road.\n\nD has fucked up your family, and she needs to understand that now. If you every want your daughter to actually change for the better, you need to stop giving her a safety net and tell her she can\u2019t come home for what she\u2019s done, because her sister needs her family.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t your daughter will likely continue to think cheating isn\u2019t that bad, because you\u2019re showing her there aren\u2019t consequences. She might get married and cheat, or she might have affairs with married men. \n\nCheating with her sisters boyfriend is one of the worst types of betrayal and she did it anyway- FOR A MONTH. If she can do that, believe me she\u2019ll continue to do a lot more if she doesn\u2019t truly regret this. \n\nSo YTA to both of your daughters if you don\u2019t support A right now. A needs the support, and D needs the fucking reality check.", "YTA - you should be supporting A during this rough time. The family should find out what D did to her own sister. For this holiday season have D miss the festivities. She should suffer immediate consequences.  You can maybe have her move back in after the holidays when A goes back home. \n\nIf I was A and you continued to support D I would absolutely go to the party and make a huge scene about how horrible my family is. I would blare out everything that happened loud and clear. Then I would leave and go NC.", "I think D needs a ticket to go somewhere else this Christmas. A flight away. D needs to learn to live within the mud pit she\u2019s created, and that means missing out on the extended family Christmas fun. A trip somewhere else can be a polite cover for people you don\u2019t want to explain why she\u2019s not there, and a reasonable resolution so A and the rest of the family can move on.\n\nYTA if you push A out this season, to let D stay. Next year is the year you should be trying to broker this peace, but right now, literally 2 weeks before a big interstate family Christmas, is not the time to force this resolution through.\n\nD needs to learn to live with her mess. And she needs to learn to not to do it again. It sucks, but if she\u2019s naive and immature she needs to grow up, she\u2019s an adult now. And not having anything physical in the last month is bollocks. It WAS physical , and timing doesn\u2019t matter. Splitting hairs over a \u2018when\u2019 is irrelevant, the big issue here is your adult daughter slept with her sister\u2019s boyfriend. I assume boyfriend is gone too.\n\nPoor A. She needs support and love, she lives far away at college, her boyfriend has been cheating on her, with her sister no less, and now she has to face \u201cthe other woman\u201d over her main family event of the year, a few weeks after finding out she\u2019s being cheated on?", "As long as you realize that A is not coming home for the holidays, at the very, very least.

She's been betrayed by her 4 years boyfriend and her sister and her mom only is concerned about playing happy family during the festivities and what would you say to relatives and friends is D won't come. And it seems you're less concerned that A would really leave because you finance her, so it's not as if she can really put her off. Wow.", "YTA & so is D.  Way to show A that none of you care about her feelings.", "INFO: Can you clarify for me\u2026 if your daughter who has had her sister and partner *repeatedly* betray her for 6 months walks away because she can\u2019t breast to pretend happy families with the person she loved and trusted who literally fucked her over\u2026. Are you saying you\u2019d stop supporting her (I assume she\u2019s in college still)? \n\nAre you saying you\u2019d tell her either she comes to the holidays and puts on a shoe for your family and keeps coming home and taking to you and pretending like you aren\u2019t now also betraying her *or you\u2019ll cut her off and she\u2019ll have to figure it out*. So you\u2019d continue to support and pay for the child who did the atrocious thing, but cut off the one who reasonably doesn\u2019t want to be around the person who betrayed her. \n\nI just need you to clear up whether I\u2019m reading that right\u2026", "YTA\n\n> A has said if I don\u2019t exclude D from the house, she will be leaving and won\u2019t return.

At this point, you aren't going to have both of them for the holidays this year, accept it. Since D lives with you and you aren't going to kick her out over this (which I do think is an unreasonable ask btw), then let A do what she needs to do and go but don't punish her by withdrawing support.  You're in a terrible position and I do feel for you.  A and D will work it out, you won't lose her forever.

I had already lived on my own for years by the time I was 20.", " YTA. She is 20 years old for goodness sake. She should know better. I bet if she was the one cheated on she wouldn\u2019t show as much grace.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve obviously already chosen bad D over innocent A. That\u2019s pretty clear. And - if you continue down this path - expect A to go no contact for the next 5-6 years. At least.\n\nThe ONLY solution here is to ban D from any and all holiday celebrations that involve A. If you want to sneak out and take D out for dinner, that\u2019s ok as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with your regular Christmas traditions.\n\nIt\u2019s 1 family holiday that takes place 3 weeks after D\u2019s HUGE betrayal. D knows she fucked up and will \ud83d\udcaf% accept being banned for Christmas THIS year and will forgive you. A will not. Nor should she.

As they say, actions speak far louder than words.\n\nThat said, of course they are your kids and they\u2019re young and you\u2019ll always live and forgive them. My own adult kids literally did far, far worse things around that age and we never once turned them away. \n\nD is young. She knows she fucked up. She knows she deserves punishment. Having D around A will only make everyone miserable. Kicking her out (to stay at a friend\u2019s or Airbnb) will send the right message to both of your kids.

Honestly, D was probably jealous A had a relationship and she didn't, and probably secretly felt good about what she was doing. Stop making excuses for her, she's obviously the favorite.

Yes, they feel horrible afterwards but their own actions caused the wreck, the pain, and all the consequences. \n\nAsk D what her immediate needs are for the next few weeks OTHER than attending festivities at your home with her sister THIS YEAR, to feel loved and supported by you.

I am 45F (mom). \n\nMy daughter A has been with her boyfriend, L, since she was 18. \n\nIt came out just last week that D had been having an affair with L over the last 6 months or so. This was discovered by A finding messages on D\u2019s iPad of all places and it all came out. Apparently they met once a month or so. \n\nWe have met L, he has been to our house several times. \n\nBoth of my girls have been home for the holidays - A usually lives out. Obviously A has been extremely upset. D has been profusely apologising and attempting to explain herself and stated that nothing has happened between them for over a month and that it was a mistake. \n\nHere comes my issue. Of course I am EXTREMELY angry at what a selfish, disgusting thing D did to her own sister. I can understand why A never wants to speak to D again and how betrayed. \n\nHowever, and I think perhaps other parents will understand this, it is still my daughter. She is very young, immature and seems hugely regretful of her decision. She also lives at home with us, while A lives out most of the year at college. \n\nA is insisting that I kick D out of the house and ban her from holiday celebrations. This year we are planning to have all extended family stay with us through the festive period, and this has already been decided. However, A has said if I don\u2019t exclude D from the house, she will be leaving and won\u2019t return. Financially, she relies on us so I am not sure how this will work for her. \n\nD has been staying with a friend since this all happened as A threatening to leave and I wanted to communicate that we were supporting A. However, she had been asking to come back and I would like her to prior to the festivities. \n\nWIBTA to do this? Please bear in mind that D would not have a place to go to if we kicked her out, and she is only 20. We could afford to put her up somewhere but that doesn\u2019t seem like an indefinite plan. It would also be sad to exclude her from the holiday festivities and would no doubt attract a lot of questions from friends and family. \n\nOn the other hand I am worried I will lose A forever, which she has threatened, if I do this. \n\n**TLDR:** My youngest daughter had a physical affair with her sisters boyfriend. The eldest is threatening to leave if I don\u2019t kick the younger one or for the holidays and beyond, which I am reluctant to do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There will be tension and arguing if  they both attend and you will get questions if one of them misses. Your oldest has every right to tell everyone what her sister did and I hope you not only respect what she decides and don\u2019t hide it.\n\nAs far as your youngest she needs to learn responsibility.

Your best chance to avoid a disaster is to arrange one of them to stay elsewhere for the holidays and let time difuse the situation a bit.

In my experience, good parenting is about natural consequences. The punishment has to teach a specific lesson related to the crime. \n\nLeaving D out of family Christmas is a really good way to give her time to think about how important family is and what its absence feels like. It gives her time to reflect on how hurt and lost her sister must be to have been betrayed by family in this way. And, it gives her a taste of what it's like to be cut off from a social situation for bad behavior. Most importantly, she needs to learn that affairs have serious, often unfixable consequences.

Tell her that you will encourage D to become more financially independent and move out so that there is less interaction or overlap in visits but both your daughters, A and D, can come home when they need to. For holidays, I suggest you don\u2019t host the family for a while. Go to relative\u2019s house\u2019s for thanksgiving/Christmas next year so the choice is up to each kid on whether they show up. Do meals separately at restaurants on off-holiday dates if you have to for now. Hopefully, that conveys that you aren\u2019t letting giving D a pass without consequences, you aren\u2019t forcing A to be around the person who knowingly betrayed her (and quite frankly, isn\u2019t that young!), but you also aren\u2019t abandoning either of your daughters to appease the other.  But you really should tell D that she needs to get a job that can help defray her living expenses because it\u2019s not right to have her full time at the house if that means her sister can never come home without having to see her.
