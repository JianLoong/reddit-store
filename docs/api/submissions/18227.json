We will be spending the weekend out at the wineries and other activities. My soon to be husbands younger sister is one of my bridesmaids. A few weeks ago when we were discussing the bachelorette party she informed us she wouldn't be coming on it. She gave no real reason other then she didn't know anyone very well and didn't want to take days off work, pretty much she just doesn't want to come. \n\nAfter everything was booking it came to about $600 a person. My maid of honor sent SIL a Venmo request for her portion since she is still party of the wedding party. SIL sent a message to the group text confused as to why she would be expected to pay. We informed her that as part of the wedding party its expected to help pay for the bachelorette. She didn't have a real reason she couldn't come she just doesn't want to. That doesn't get her off the hook for the responsibilities she signed up for.\n\nNow that the trip is tomorrow the other bridesmaids are pissed they had to pull out money to cover SIL portion. I sent her a message explaining what comes along with the being a bridesmaid and asking her to please sent my MOH the money because she is putting a downer on the weekend and ruining it.

YTA.\n\nOn top of that, I don't understand \"responsibilities as a bridesmaid.\" It's not some binding contract that she is obligated to keep.

But if I ever get married, I will be damned if I expect people to pay for these things out of some warped sense of tradition, especially if they don't want to go. She probably can't afford it. A bride is already asking people to buy a gift, clothes, etc. I think adding this amount of money on top is the definition of entitled. You don't need all this stuff.

It looks like you made a big fat unwarranted assumption.", "YTA.  It doesn't seem how you wrote the post that you made sure of the terms prior to her acceptance of being a bridesmaid.

No, this person does not have to subsidize your part of the Bach.  Jesus.  She told you she wasn\u2019t going, she doesn\u2019t have to pay a dime.", "YTA.

That is a reason ffs.", "YTA, it\u2019s not like you booked them she dropped out last minute. She\u2019s allowed to decide not to go, and bachelorette trips are way out of hand financially so it\u2019s a fair decision. You don\u2019t get to charge her when she told you way ahead of time - the entitlement!!", "YTA- if she is NOT going then no she doesnt have to pay for the rest of you to have fun.  These are the types of events that people need to be ASKED about beforehand not expected to pay large sums for.  She said no, you then needed to then go back and redo the amounts everyone was paying.   The only thing she signed up for was wearing a dress at your wedding.", "YTA. She is not coming, why is she expected to pay? What responsibilities? She is not financially responsible for any part of your bridal celebration unless she is actually taking part in it. By being a bridesmaid she is doing YOU a favor, as bridesmaids are expected to buy a matching outfit, do their hair and makeup to a higher standard than a regular guest, and perform certain functions at the actual wedding day. You are being extremely entitled if you expect her to cover for your bachelorette if she isn't even going.", "YTA, never heard of something so ludicrous. Accepting a bridesmaid spot doesn\u2019t automatically \u2018sign you up\u2019 to paying for other people\u2019s trips. $600 is fine for a trip if you\u2019re well off and can drop that kind of money for a one off event, but the average person doesn\u2019t have that kind of money lying around to spend on something they haven\u2019t chosen to do. Also, it\u2019s *not* tradition for the wedding party to pay for the bachelorette, at most the other hens chip in to cover the bride\u2019s portion but *only* if they are also attending the trip.", "How much are you spending on this trip that her portion of your expenses for it is $600?!?  It sounds as though you are expecting her to pay the same portion that the rest of the bridesmaids are paying, which means that she's financing part of all of their expenses, not just her share of the bride's trip.  If that's the case, then YTA.", "YTA. She is under no obligation to pay for other people to party. Very entitled of you and your friends to think otherwise.", "YTA. Do I really have to explain it to you?! Who would ever pay for YOUR trip especially bcs it seems you never specified the details to her when you asked her to be bm?

She gave plenty of notice that she wasn't going, people pay for what they do. I planned a hen do and there were a lot of people (around 20) and it was a full weekend not just a day, so people paid for what they attended, some needed accommodation, some didn't as they lived close by. Part of it we went to a spa and some people weren't comfortable with that so they didn't come, meaning they didn't pay. If you expect people to pay regardless of attendance, then that should have been mentioned at the start of the planning, not just assumed.", "YTA. You don't get to force her to pay for your party, get over your entitled attitude. I can see why she wouldn't want to go.", "YTA you bridezillas really are wild. Your thought process is fascinating. Nobody is paying you. And this whole $600 situation is ridiculous. I hope your husband sees this as his sign to run far away", "YTA\n\nShe's a bridesmaid, not your personal ATM. \n\nThe traditional responsibilities of a bridesmaid are to support the bride as she gets married, which ultimately only absolutely and necessarily includes standing up for her at the actual wedding. More realistically, it also often includes planning and hosting a shower and/or bachelorette party AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE WEDDING PARTY. As the bride, you are not a cruise director. If your bridesmaids want to celebrate you, that is certainly up to them, but to direct them to do so would be shockingly entitled and tacky.\n\nAs to your specific situation: like so many brides we read about here, you went well beyond tradition - which would have been a single party to celebrate the bride - and planned an entire weekend of expensive activities, which you're referring to as your \"bachelorette\" as though it's equivalent, and therefore realistic to demand as the \"responsibility\" of your wedding party. It is not. \n\nYou are a bride, not the Great Goddess Idol of All, to be worshipped on a pedestal for days on end. If the ladies WANTED to plan something fun together before you get married, that's lovely. Suggesting that someone who very reasonably told you that she cannot make it (because your plans are expensive, she'd have to take off work, and she doesn't even know most of the people going) should still send you SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS so that the rest of you . . . most of whom, again, she doesn't even know . . . can have fun with hundreds of dollars of her hard-earned money? Yeah, that's just a WTF.", "Jeese, yes, of course YTA.  \n\nExpecting payment for a party she is not even attending?  You owe her an apology.  You owe your fianc\u00e9 an apology too if they have had to deal with this BS drama. \n\nSecondly, it is very cheap and tacky to expect your bridal party to foot the bill for major expenses.  You are the one that chose to get married AND ASKED THEM to participate.  You should pay the 600 out of pocket that SIL would have paid....had she went.  The bridal party should be mad at you for making them split the 600.\n\nDo the right thing.  Stop reading and make it right.", "YTA. She\u2019s not going, why should she pay? The wedding party are not, in fact, obligated to pay for whatever you think they should pay for.", "YTA. First of all, this isn\u2019t a bachelorette party. A bachelorette party is a one day event. This is a vacation you and your bridesmaids are taking to celebrate your upcoming wedding. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that but it is wrong to expect one of your bridesmaids to pay for part of a vacation they\u2019re not going on. Only the people going should have to pay. Personally I think that when it comes to bachelor or bachelorette vacations, even the the guest of honor should pay at least some of the costs rather than having the attendees cover their share. It\u2019s ridiculous for you to get a free vacation on your bridesmaid\u2019s dime.", "YTA. She's not going, she doesn't need to pay.", "YTA. Money could have been the issue in the first place but she was embarrassed to admit it. \n\nI personally hate bachelor/ette weekends!", "100% yes, you are the asshole. Being a part of a bridal party doesn't mean you have to foot a $600 bill for something your not going to go to. That is absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA - and way to go in getting off on the wrong foot with your soon-to-be husband's family.  Expecting others to pay for your wedding is called being entitled.  Has your fiance given an opinion?  And the rest of his family?  I expect there will be some interesting Thanksgiving dinners in your future.", "YTA and you know it. She is NOT coming. In what world would YOU pay $600 bucks for a trip you aren't going on? What the hell??? The rationale behind this  is absurd as hell. And you know that. Get out the wedding fog. Shake your head a little bit, go touch some grass and then come back with a clear head and justify this. \n\n\nYou are so out of line for this. Also, she has a fucking reason. She doesn't have the time to take off for this trip. So in addition to her paying for a trip she isn't going on, you are also convinced SHE should put her livelihood on the line for your party??!!!! \n\nGo touch some grass!!!!!", "YTA.\n\n\nIf the party is just for one night in town, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect people to make it, but if it\u2019s a trip someone needs to take days off and pay $600, work and financial restrictions are valid reasons not to go.\n\nShe gave you reasons and you just keep saying she doesn\u2019t have any reasons. \n\n\nYou booked the trip after she gave you a notice weeks ago when plan was still in discussion. \n\nWhat is her share of ubers she said she wouldn\u2019t ride, Airbnb she said she wouldn\u2019t stay, wine she said she wouldn\u2019t drink, and activities she said she wouldn\u2019t do?", "YTA.

She said she isn\u2019t coming, then you book and expect her to pay? Get over yourselves", "Wow.  YTA.  The entitlement is shocking.

This is a terrible way to start off your relationship with your SIL.

Covering bachelorette party costs used to mean for a night out or maybe a day of local events. This trend of turning it into a full on vacation and still expecting people to shell out close to a grand just for a place to stay (not even counting activities and food) is absolutely bonkers. Your bridesmaids shouldn't be subsidizing your wedding, that's on you and your partner. I'm guessing they're also paying for their own dresses and hair and makeup. If they are, you're delusional that anyone would pay that much just to see you get married.\n\nHere's a tip, outside of your immediate siblings and parents, nobody really gives a fuck you're getting married. Going to a wedding that isn't your own is a social obligation that you grin and say you loved even though you were probably bored out of your skull for most of it. Even as a guest it's at least $100 for a wedding present and giving up a day's worth of time and effort for someone else to have a happy day.

We will be spending the weekend out at the wineries and other activities. My soon to be husbands younger sister is one of my bridesmaids. A few weeks ago when we were discussing the bachelorette party she informed us she wouldn't be coming on it. She gave no real reason other then she didn't know anyone very well and didn't want to take days off work, pretty much she just doesn't want to come. \n\nAfter everything was booking it came to about $600 a person. My maid of honor sent SIL a Venmo request for her portion since she is still party of the wedding party. SIL sent a message to the group text confused as to why she would be expected to pay. We informed her that as part of the wedding party its expected to help pay for the bachelorette. She didn't have a real reason she couldn't come she just doesn't want to. That doesn't get her off the hook for the responsibilities she signed up for.\n\nNow that the trip is tomorrow the other bridesmaids are pissed they had to pull out money to cover SIL portion. I sent her a message explaining what comes along with the being a bridesmaid and asking her to please sent my MOH the money because she is putting a downer on the weekend and ruining it. I have not heard back and the bridesmaids are super pissed they are out money.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We booked the house the  January before, with me, MIL and SIL agreeing on dates and the costs, which was to be split 3 ways. Well, come then jn May, we were told BIL didn\u2019t request the days off early enough do now they could only do 4 days not the full week. We\u2019re like okay. But then payment comes due in mid June and he doesn\u2019t see why they need to pay for the days they\u2019re not there. We had all agreed and it\u2019s not our fault he didn\u2019t request the days off when we planned in January. Then his argument was that HE (even though SIL ran it all by him) didn\u2019t agree to this so he doesn\u2019t see why he has to do it. So he was the asshole there because everything was agreed upon before booking. We canceled the entire trip (and were able to get the deposit back) because we weren\u2019t going to pick up another $500-600 in unplanned expenses.
