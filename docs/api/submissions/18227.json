We will be spending the weekend out at the wineries and other activities. My soon to be husbands younger sister is one of my bridesmaids.

She gave no real reason other then she didn't know anyone very well and didn't want to take days off work, pretty much she just doesn't want to come. \n\nAfter everything was booking it came to about $600 a person. My maid of honor sent SIL a Venmo request for her portion since she is still party of the wedding party. SIL sent a message to the group text confused as to why she would be expected to pay. We informed her that as part of the wedding party its expected to help pay for the bachelorette. She didn't have a real reason she couldn't come she just doesn't want to. That doesn't get her off the hook for the responsibilities she signed up for.\n\nNow that the trip is tomorrow the other bridesmaids are pissed they had to pull out money to cover SIL portion. I sent her a message explaining what comes along with the being a bridesmaid and asking her to please sent my MOH the money because she is putting a downer on the weekend and ruining it.

But if I ever get married, I will be damned if I expect people to pay for these things out of some warped sense of tradition, especially if they don't want to go. She probably can't afford it. A bride is already asking people to buy a gift, clothes, etc. I think adding this amount of money on top is the definition of entitled. You don't need all this stuff.

It looks like you made a big fat unwarranted assumption.", "YTA.  It doesn't seem how you wrote the post that you made sure of the terms prior to her acceptance of being a bridesmaid.

That is a reason ffs.", "YTA, it\u2019s not like you booked them she dropped out last minute. She\u2019s allowed to decide not to go, and bachelorette trips are way out of hand financially so it\u2019s a fair decision. You don\u2019t get to charge her when she told you way ahead of time - the entitlement!!", "YTA- if she is NOT going then no she doesnt have to pay for the rest of you to have fun.

She said no, you then needed to then go back and redo the amounts everyone was paying.   The only thing she signed up for was wearing a dress at your wedding.", "YTA. She is not coming, why is she expected to pay? What responsibilities? She is not financially responsible for any part of your bridal celebration unless she is actually taking part in it. By being a bridesmaid she is doing YOU a favor, as bridesmaids are expected to buy a matching outfit, do their hair and makeup to a higher standard than a regular guest, and perform certain functions at the actual wedding day. You are being extremely entitled if you expect her to cover for your bachelorette if she isn't even going.", "YTA, never heard of something so ludicrous. Accepting a bridesmaid spot doesn\u2019t automatically \u2018sign you up\u2019 to paying for other people\u2019s trips. $600 is fine for a trip if you\u2019re well off and can drop that kind of money for a one off event, but the average person doesn\u2019t have that kind of money lying around to spend on something they haven\u2019t chosen to do. Also, it\u2019s *not* tradition for the wedding party to pay for the bachelorette, at most the other hens chip in to cover the bride\u2019s portion but *only* if they are also attending the trip.", "How much are you spending on this trip that her portion of your expenses for it is $600?!?  It sounds as though you are expecting her to pay the same portion that the rest of the bridesmaids are paying, which means that she's financing part of all of their expenses, not just her share of the bride's trip.  If that's the case, then YTA.", "YTA. She is under no obligation to pay for other people to party. Very entitled of you and your friends to think otherwise.", "YTA.

She gave plenty of notice that she wasn't going, people pay for what they do. I planned a hen do and there were a lot of people (around 20) and it was a full weekend not just a day, so people paid for what they attended, some needed accommodation, some didn't as they lived close by. Part of it we went to a spa and some people weren't comfortable with that so they didn't come, meaning they didn't pay. If you expect people to pay regardless of attendance, then that should have been mentioned at the start of the planning, not just assumed.", "YTA. You don't get to force her to pay for your party, get over your entitled attitude. I can see why she wouldn't want to go.", "YTA you bridezillas really are wild. Your thought process is fascinating. Nobody is paying you. And this whole $600 situation is ridiculous. I hope your husband sees this as his sign to run far away", "YTA\n\nShe's a bridesmaid, not your personal ATM. \n\nThe traditional responsibilities of a bridesmaid are to support the bride as she gets married, which ultimately only absolutely and necessarily includes standing up for her at the actual wedding. More realistically, it also often includes planning and hosting a shower and/or bachelorette party AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE WEDDING PARTY. As the bride, you are not a cruise director. If your bridesmaids want to celebrate you, that is certainly up to them, but to direct them to do so would be shockingly entitled and tacky.\n\nAs to your specific situation: like so many brides we read about here, you went well beyond tradition - which would have been a single party to celebrate the bride - and planned an entire weekend of expensive activities, which you're referring to as your \"bachelorette\" as though it's equivalent, and therefore realistic to demand as the \"responsibility\" of your wedding party. It is not. \n\nYou are a bride, not the Great Goddess Idol of All, to be worshipped on a pedestal for days on end. If the ladies WANTED to plan something fun together before you get married, that's lovely. Suggesting that someone who very reasonably told you that she cannot make it (because your plans are expensive, she'd have to take off work, and she doesn't even know most of the people going) should still send you SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS so that the rest of you . . . most of whom, again, she doesn't even know . . . can have fun with hundreds of dollars of her hard-earned money? Yeah, that's just a WTF.", "Jeese, yes, of course YTA.  \n\nExpecting payment for a party she is not even attending?  You owe her an apology.  You owe your fianc\u00e9 an apology too if they have had to deal with this BS drama. \n\nSecondly, it is very cheap and tacky to expect your bridal party to foot the bill for major expenses.  You are the one that chose to get married AND ASKED THEM to participate.  You should pay the 600 out of pocket that SIL would have paid....had she went.  The bridal party should be mad at you for making them split the 600.\n\nDo the right thing.  Stop reading and make it right.", "YTA. She\u2019s not going, why should she pay? The wedding party are not, in fact, obligated to pay for whatever you think they should pay for.", "YTA. First of all, this isn\u2019t a bachelorette party. A bachelorette party is a one day event. This is a vacation you and your bridesmaids are taking to celebrate your upcoming wedding. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that but it is wrong to expect one of your bridesmaids to pay for part of a vacation they\u2019re not going on. Only the people going should have to pay. Personally I think that when it comes to bachelor or bachelorette vacations, even the the guest of honor should pay at least some of the costs rather than having the attendees cover their share. It\u2019s ridiculous for you to get a free vacation on your bridesmaid\u2019s dime.", "YTA. She's not going, she doesn't need to pay.", "YTA. Money could have been the issue in the first place but she was embarrassed to admit it. \n\nI personally hate bachelor/ette weekends!", "100% yes, you are the asshole. Being a part of a bridal party doesn't mean you have to foot a $600 bill for something your not going to go to. That is absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA - and way to go in getting off on the wrong foot with your soon-to-be husband's family.  Expecting others to pay for your wedding is called being entitled.  Has your fiance given an opinion?  And the rest of his family?  I expect there will be some interesting Thanksgiving dinners in your future.", "YTA and you know it. She is NOT coming. In what world would YOU pay $600 bucks for a trip you aren't going on? What the hell??? The rationale behind this  is absurd as hell. And you know that. Get out the wedding fog. Shake your head a little bit, go touch some grass and then come back with a clear head and justify this. \n\n\nYou are so out of line for this. Also, she has a fucking reason. She doesn't have the time to take off for this trip.

Covering bachelorette party costs used to mean for a night out or maybe a day of local events. This trend of turning it into a full on vacation and still expecting people to shell out close to a grand just for a place to stay (not even counting activities and food) is absolutely bonkers. Your bridesmaids shouldn't be subsidizing your wedding, that's on you and your partner. I'm guessing they're also paying for their own dresses and hair and makeup. If they are, you're delusional that anyone would pay that much just to see you get married.\n\nHere's a tip, outside of your immediate siblings and parents, nobody really gives a fuck you're getting married. Going to a wedding that isn't your own is a social obligation that you grin and say you loved even though you were probably bored out of your skull for most of it. Even as a guest it's at least $100 for a wedding present and giving up a day's worth of time and effort for someone else to have a happy day.

We will be spending the weekend out at the wineries and other activities. My soon to be husbands younger sister is one of my bridesmaids. A few weeks ago when we were discussing the bachelorette party she informed us she wouldn't be coming on it. She gave no real reason other then she didn't know anyone very well and didn't want to take days off work, pretty much she just doesn't want to come. \n\nAfter everything was booking it came to about $600 a person. My maid of honor sent SIL a Venmo request for her portion since she is still party of the wedding party. SIL sent a message to the group text confused as to why she would be expected to pay. We informed her that as part of the wedding party its expected to help pay for the bachelorette. She didn't have a real reason she couldn't come she just doesn't want to. That doesn't get her off the hook for the responsibilities she signed up for.\n\nNow that the trip is tomorrow the other bridesmaids are pissed they had to pull out money to cover SIL portion. I sent her a message explaining what comes along with the being a bridesmaid and asking her to please sent my MOH the money because she is putting a downer on the weekend and ruining it. I have not heard back and the bridesmaids are super pissed they are out money.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We booked the house the  January before, with me, MIL and SIL agreeing on dates and the costs, which was to be split 3 ways. Well, come then jn May, we were told BIL didn\u2019t request the days off early enough do now they could only do 4 days not the full week. We\u2019re like okay. But then payment comes due in mid June and he doesn\u2019t see why they need to pay for the days they\u2019re not there. We had all agreed and it\u2019s not our fault he didn\u2019t request the days off when we planned in January. Then his argument was that HE (even though SIL ran it all by him) didn\u2019t agree to this so he doesn\u2019t see why he has to do it. So he was the asshole there because everything was agreed upon before booking.

I had to say I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t go. The wedding is already costing me over $1k", "This!! This is extortion!!", "Hahahah thank you for the laugh-such a valid point!!", "I live in a wine region and $600 per person for a nicer than normal yet non-extravagant trip over a holiday weekend is not out of bounds from what I would expect to pay.\n\nStill, SIL should not be expected to put in, especially since she didn\u2019t even back out\u2026 she told everybody before planning began not to include her because she would not be going.", "When (how many years ago) did this $200 dollarpp. event take place? If you say \"2023\" I would love to have you be my event planner from now on.

It\u2019s the groom\u2019s sister, being included in the bridesmaids because the ceremony attendants are being divided on gender lines. Just because the look of the wedding is to have her standing on the bride\u2019s side doesn\u2019t mean she should be expected to give the bride additional \u201cfriend\u201d gifts or want to party with the bride and bride\u2019s friends. I can *maybe* see expecting close friends of the bride to be willing to treat the bride, as long as the expectations are reasonable and the bride reciprocates with her friends. FSIL isn\u2019t one of them.", "I make decent money and could afford the $600, but honestly no.  Just no.  No way in hell.\n\nNot for a bachelorette.  Wouldn\u2019t matter if it were my absolute best friend.  That\u2019s too much PER PERSON.", "My immediate thought as well.", "Yes. Very adroit.", "You know, you didn\u2019t have to, should have said no. I don\u2019t get how anyone could have the audacity to ask for payment for something you didn\u2019t even get to take part in.", "Or in the backyard with a metric fuck-ton of wine, hunch punch and penis shaped everything- including the cake.", "I only get 12 vacation days a year.

I work weekends too. No one considers this when they ask me to travel to visit family, that it is in fact exorbitantly expensive given the loss of income and I have to plan carefully to allow for it. Oh and OP, YTA for even having a huge bachelorette that cost everyone 600 a person that was * not optional *. \nI've never heard that those entirely non wedding parties were required by the party. Smh.", "I did as well. It seems so rude to me. And since I\u2019m not made of money the things I couldn\u2019t afford I didn\u2019t make anyone do.", "Eh, I think it depends on when she cxld vs the cancellation policy for the event. If she said she wouldn\u2019t attend it in time to lower the cost of the event, she should not be liable for it; or if she never agreed to go in the first place and the event cost isn\u2019t based on head count. (YTA) if she agreed to go and then backed out after the cxl policy passed and everything was set, NTA.

No darling. There are no responsibilities. She\u2019s doing you a favor by supporting you at your wedding and in your marriage.

Get over yourself.", "It is extremely tacky to plan your own expensive party and expect others to foot the bill. Demanding someone pay for a party they are not even attending is just nutty. Getting mad because someone doesn't want to cater to your selfish whim and take time off work to pay to attend your party is downright rude. YTA.", "Also saying she \u201csigned up\u201d ignores the fact that OP asked her to be a bridesmaid and as the grooms sister, could SIL really have said \u201cno thanks, I don\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid\u201d? Signing up and fulfilling basically a family obligation are very different.", "I misread thinking it was $600 total like aha okay maybe it's just $100 bucks or something. \n\n$600 a PERSON?! Jesus.", "Right? Who's mad enough to drop $600 to spend days with people you barely know doing things you'd much rather not be doing? Even if you know everyone and want to go? $600?? For only the bachelorette? Who knows what else the wedding party has to pay for. The hardest of nos from me. Like live your best life and live happily ever after, but I'll keep my money thank you.", "OP probably having a cash bar", "Every wedding I have been in, I had to buy my dress.", "\u201cI had to work\u201d should be a valid excuse for basically anything except your own wedding or child being born", "That's the way to do it!", "Yeah for sure. But some people will definitely say other things instead of \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d. I think regardless of the excuse people should mind their business", "That's exactly what I thought. My sister got married when I was 17 and I had a minimum wage, part time job. I was in the bridal party so the gift for her and the dress was tough to pay for. But something like this would have broke me!\n\nYTA", "My BFF's bachelorette party consisted of hanging out in a hotel room for the night, drinking, snacking, and opening up her gifts for her wedding night... cost all of us about $75 each when pitching in for the cost of food and hotel room.", "My sister had a whole weekend with her college friends, who were now scattered across the country, and it was pretty spendy! (My sister paid her own way, tho.) I declined because I was a decade older than they were and 7 months pregnant, and everyone was fine with that! Because they were nearby, I showed up for brunch on Saturday, and I just paid for all of brunch for everybody, because I was a decade older and more established and I could afford a splurge of paying for brunch for 10. They were all really touched.\n\n(I told them I had to pee because of the baby and then I'd head out, bye!, and then I went to the hostess stand and paid everyone's brunch, and then I left, so they were all surprised by having no bill.)\n\nThey all came for a nostalgia college weekend hanging out together, and they all paid their own way. It was incidentally related to my sister's wedding, but mostly about hanging out together.", "Sounds like SIL got rope into being a bridesmaid and just didn't want to do it", "Or maybe she does know OP and her friends \"that well\" which is exactly why she doesn't want to spend an entire weekend with them especially without the mediating presence of her brother.", "Probably!", "We paid for bridal party dresses and tux rentals for our wedding too. I also think it\u2019s rude to expect people to pay for a dress they\u2019ll probably never wear again or a tux rental. If you\u2019re spending thousands of dollars on a wedding, then budget for the bridal party outfits too. It\u2019s ridiculous how much some people expect their friends to spend on THEIR wedding.", "I'm an American, and I always thought bridesmaids paid for their own dresses and stuff for the wedding day... I bought my own dress for a friend's wedding that never happened. Like, are there etiquette books on weddings somewhere?", "Maybe my Mom raised me old-fashioned. But she had said bride pays for the dresses (I paid for both my weddings so I did pay for the dresses.) A search just now says that\u2019s a British thing. \n\nShe also said things like the mother of the bride can\u2019t throw the bridal shower, (so I didn\u2019t get one,) and that the grandmother-to-be can\u2019t host the baby shower and it your kids are close in age that it\u2019s tacky to have a baby shower for the same gender. A quick google search says I was raised very old-fashioned.", "I was told that same thing about the mother of the brides and was informed that it's the MOH and bridesmaids job to plan and host a bridal shower or bachelorette. My church's young adult women threw my bridal party where I got stuff from my registry while my MOH and bridesmaids threw I nice bachelorette party for me that did well for under 21. I also grew up hearing how the bridesmaids all bought their own wedding day clothes and jewelry. Now, the baby shower, I was told, was the job of the grandmothers-to-be on both sides (usually)... it must be different kinds of cultural beliefs all around. \n\nHow about having a boy after 2 girls and the oldest being 5 when the boy comes, on baby showers?", "YTA.  She said she wasn't going before anything was booked.  Why in the holy heck do you think that she would be OK with paying $600 for something she isn't going to take part in.  \n\nI can't say what I think about you as it would be ungentlemanly.", "Not to mention, imagine what being in the wedding, like literally just what she is expected to pay for the actual day of the wedding, is going to cost of this is just the bachelorette? I'd bet the reason is money and she's trying too save face or something. \n\nWell that and specifically spending that much money on someone that entitled, not sure I'd want to be around those people", "Fuck, I would not want to waste precious vacation time to stay with this entitled asshole. Let alone pay money for her share of it.", "And not to mention that even if you believe someone CAN afford it, doesn't mean your entitled for them to spend their money on what you want them to!!!", "My sister\u2019s was in a nice salon for pedis, food, dinner, hotel, booze and brunch the next day at one of the nicer restaurants in town. Five girls including my sister. My mom joined us for the dinner. I think the entire thing for all of us cost a bit more than $600. (My friend owned the salon and cut us a deal and got stuff on sale) $600 a person is highway robbery.", "Not to mention.. SIL probably did not want to spend the money.. cause that sounds miserable. \n\nResponsibilities of a bridal party is a joke. OP, you sound rough and yes, YTA. \nThis should be an inclusive event.. if people cannot afford it.. you don\u2019t charge them anyway.", "This does not sound fun to me at all. It sounds wretched and I would much rather be at work.", " I got married last November and my bachelorette was brunch and games at a friends house\u2026with penis straws. It was exactly what I wanted and it was a fun day. \n\nIt honestly makes me sick to my stomach a little to see so many people that I know in my life both close and by proxy expecting their friends and family to drop tons of money and time for their wedding. Most people are happy and excited to celebrate a wedding but asking so much financially is disrespectful to the people who care about you. Me choosing to get married and have a wedding was not the financial burden of my friends and your wedding should not be causing stress for other people.\n\nBridal and wedding culture has gotten really out of hand and for many people, away from the point of a wedding which is the commitment to another person, not the aesthetic of a wedding or the attention of milking being a bride for as long as possible (I say as I\u2019m going to 1/3 showers for the same person this weekend).", "What about pun the cock on the hunk game \u2026. Anyone remember that one? \n\nOp yta\u2026 you sil to be made her intentions clear you better hope your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t that close to his sister cause his probably gut sine thing to say about your greedy entitled actions."]}
