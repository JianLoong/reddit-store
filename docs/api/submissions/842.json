They will take them if the guy permanently surrenders them, at which point they will be put down for aggression. Or they can starve to death while the guy is in the hospital.\n\nEven rescues that work with aggression are unlikely to work with dogs that aggressive. If you can find any space in a rescue right now.

I think it's more likely that the neighbor asked a buddy to help him intimidate OP into taking care of the dogs for him.  OP, if they call again, then ask the \"cop\" for his name and badge number.  Either he will hang up because he was just busted or he will give you the information you need to report him to his superiors because his repeated requests are extremely inappropriate and unprofessional.\n\nNTA", "Agreed.... sure.

Some operate as emergency shelters to take in pets that have owners but those owners cannot temporarily take care of them.  Like during a natural disaster and the owners are temporarily forced out of their home,  or like this situation where the owner is in the hospital and has no one else who can take the animals.

Few places will take in aggressive dogs. It is very hard to find people willing to work with aggressive dogs, or foster them. They often need to have no other pets, for safety reasons, and no children in the home. They need the skills and know how to be able to do the work.\n\nAre there people who dedicate their lives to this kind of work? Absolutely. But it's not a case of dial up an experienced foster for aggressive dogs. You're looking at a handful in a big city.", "Yikes.  Well, that's what I get for assuming.  I would definitely report him if he keeps bothering you.", "This situation reminds me of a story about a man in Texas who had several acres of land and kept several aggressive dogs. He had a good fence and kept the dogs in the fenced yard all the time.  Mail delivery person realized he had not collected his mail for several days so called authorities for a welfare check. All they found were remnants of clothing and a few of the larger bones. They didn't know if the man died and dogs ate him or if he fell and the dogs attacked him and killed him before they ate him.  Authorities had to put the dogs down because they were so aggressive and dog trainers felt like they couldn't be trusted even with training.", "I'm sorry to say it, but your neighbor shouldn't have these dogs then.

Guilt, pride, misplaced love, being stubborn..?", "Yeah there's a big difference between aggressive and reactive dogs too. Even if it's two ends of one spectrum. My dog is reactive when triggered, but I'm absence of triggers she enjoys meeting new friends, and the triggers are very specific and avoidable. I know they did an initial behavioral eval at the shelter to determine if she was aggressive\n\nIf the triggers are \"anyone besides my owner\" then the dog is aggressive \n\nI feel bad for the dogs in this post. They will likely be put down. And they could have had a good life if properly socialized and cared for.

I work with cats, not dogs, but there's a huge difference between \"cat that will scratch to get you to back tf off when cornered\" and \"cat that will chase you down in order to keep attacking.\"\n\nFor a while we were the only foster family that I know of (and possibly the only one in the city) who took in cats with pursuit aggression. Most rescues it was an immediate put down.\n\nWorking with genuine aggression requires a shitton of time, emotional bandwidth, patience, and protective gear. They cannot be exposed to other animals. They cannot be exposed to children. They require a ton of planning, every single day. There is a reason so few fosters are willing to do it.", "Anyone else get the Suicide Kings reference.\n\nYou have good taste my friend", "One of my absolute favorite Dark Comedies along with Clay Pidgeons.
