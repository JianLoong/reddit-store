She was drunk. Thinking clearly isn't easy when you're drunk.\n\nHave you never meant to say something good and it came out horrible? Have you never known anyone else to do so, in your life?\n\n\"I didn't mean it that way\" are words you've never heard before?\n\nThere's no such thing as miscommunication?\n\nEmotionally mature people understand that whether you meant it that way or not, it hurt. She isn't emotionally mature. She made a mistake she hasn't owned up to yet. She is one of the AH's in the story.\n\nBut she didn't deserve to get treated like that. *Especially* because she wasn't malicious. Innocent until proven guilty, and nothing OP said about her proves she was malicious. If the only reason you treat her as malicious is to *assume* she was, then you're doing it wrong, imo.\n\nOr to put it another way, what OP did to her is worse than what she did to the blind guy.

I could bring that up and there is no way anyone could say anything that would trigger me. That trauma has resolved mostly.\n\nMy next worst is having an ex girlfriend stalk me for two years, and then a jealous and abusive ex wife who completely destroyed me during the virus both financially and mentally.\n\nIf I was to engage in discussion about that at a party it would be insane.  I would almost certainly have responses from sexist guys using my story as an excuse to say bad things and make generalizations about women.  I would almost certainly have comments from sexist women showing very little empathy or even attacking me when I really need empathy as a victim of abuse and stalking that has destroyed me completely.\n\nIf that occurred, I would think that I was an idiot for discussing it when i know I have not recovered from it and maybe never will.  I would think the toxic sexist guys were assholes for their comments, and I would think the toxic sexist women were assholes for their comments.\n\nTherefore, I don't think I would discuss it in that setting with those risks.", "I agree.", "Didn't deserve what? To get what she said thrown back at her? It was literally the exact same insult.\n\nAlso, no. She didn't try to explain. She doubled down on calling friends mom a bad mom.

Why does her being hurt the only thing that matters?\n\nAnd how is it that her insult isn't direct exactly? She literally called friends mom a bad mom. The exact same insult op threw at her. You're giving her every excuse in the book instead of realizing she's a shit person who said something shit about another person's mother.

I view things similarly; in a perfect world, yeah, we should be able to bring up stuff like that and get support for it. The average person isn't equipped for that support, unfortunately, and even if they are it's easy to lean too hard.\n\nSo it ends up being a matter of time and place.

I believe she was trying to demonstrate empathy, and sucked at it.\n\n>Crazy how you have all the empathy in the world for her, but none for the guy who just got told his mom is a \\* mom.\n\nWhat makes you think I don't? What would displaying empathy for him look like, that I'm not doing?\n\nI'm not calling the blind guy an AH.\n\nI literally said she made mistakes and has a lesson to learn. Just because she was wrong doesn't mean she deserves inhumane torture and removal of her arms and legs. Right? There are things such as 'overkill' and 'unwarranted reaction'? You can admit that it's possible that the response is at least *potentially* cruel and unusual punishment, escalated far, far above and beyond the crime itself?\n\nBasically what happened here, even after you remove the exaggeration. She made the blind guy shift uncomfortably. He insulted her repeatedly about things kind of unrelated to this issue (like he'd been bottling it up and it just burst out) and made her cry.\n\nHers was probably an accident. His was *definitely* on purpose.\n\nThe two are not the same.\n\nHe responded inappropriately and escalated it too far.\n\nIf there was any kind of indication that she was faking the crying to put on a show or whatever then that'd be a completely different story. I wonder if some of the people predisposed to think the worst of women are assuming that or something. But anyway.\n\nESH is a pretty clear ruling here even if you want to quibble over who was worse.

Empathy is understanding why the blind person was hurt by her comments. Empathy is understanding that when someone \"tries to explain\" what they said, it means *they didn't intend to be mean*. If they intended to be mean, and upset someone... why would they then go back and explain it?\n\nEmpathy is also understanding that in the world at large, most people really aren't malicious as a starting point. This has nothing to do with gender. There is a phrase in the US called \"innocent until proven guilty.\" The OP has not provided enough evidence to say that this woman *intended* to hurt. There's a small chance: To answer my own question from earlier, sometimes people \"try to explain\" their comment as a way to backtrack. (But in this case she didn't sound like she was trying to backtrack, sounded like she was trying to *clarify*.)\n\nBut without proof that she was malicious, it's generally moral to assume she wasn't. Did she cause harm? Make mistakes? Do something wrong? Absolutely. But it wasn't *on purpose*.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that there's all kinds of people in the world. And perhaps with age comes some awareness of situations that you have seen before. I have seen people mean to say something good and it accidentally comes out really horrible sounding. Haven't you? How long have you lived, if you haven't ever done that yourself or ever seen anyone else make that mistake?\n\n*It's still a mistake* and *she is still wrong for it* but *I never said she wasn't*. Key points.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that good people make mistakes and they're still mistakes. Empathy is understanding that insulting people makes them defensive and defensive people shut down and double down. Insults are not a path to conflict resolution.\n\nYou don't insult someone and then expect them to apologize to you. That like never happens. Empathy is understanding why that never happens.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that insulting is wrong even when you're insulting someone that has done something wrong.\n\nHope some of that helps you understand empathy a little more.

It should have stayed at that even if she tried to argue", "Since we (and her) have no idea about the circumstances of the accident we can't have an opinion on how good a mother was friend's mother. It could be a freakish accident or negligence. Either way it is irrelevant to compare herself (girl in question) with someone else. I even would get the \"I wish adults were more careful so you didn't have to experience something like this\" but putting herself in that unknowing situation and comparing her skills with someone else's is really irrelevant. And it can make friend sad, if it is true because of his mother negligence, if it is fault because he knows it was not his mother fault. So NTA.
