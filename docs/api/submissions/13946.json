Empathy is understanding why the blind person was hurt by her comments. Empathy is understanding that when someone \"tries to explain\" what they said, it means *they didn't intend to be mean*. If they intended to be mean, and upset someone... why would they then go back and explain it?\n\nEmpathy is also understanding that in the world at large, most people really aren't malicious as a starting point. This has nothing to do with gender. There is a phrase in the US called \"innocent until proven guilty.\" The OP has not provided enough evidence to say that this woman *intended* to hurt. There's a small chance: To answer my own question from earlier, sometimes people \"try to explain\" their comment as a way to backtrack. (But in this case she didn't sound like she was trying to backtrack, sounded like she was trying to *clarify*.)\n\nBut without proof that she was malicious, it's generally moral to assume she wasn't. Did she cause harm? Make mistakes? Do something wrong? Absolutely. But it wasn't *on purpose*.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that there's all kinds of people in the world. And perhaps with age comes some awareness of situations that you have seen before. I have seen people mean to say something good and it accidentally comes out really horrible sounding. Haven't you? How long have you lived, if you haven't ever done that yourself or ever seen anyone else make that mistake?\n\n*It's still a mistake* and *she is still wrong for it* but *I never said she wasn't*. Key points.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that good people make mistakes and they're still mistakes. Empathy is understanding that insulting people makes them defensive and defensive people shut down and double down. Insults are not a path to conflict resolution.\n\nYou don't insult someone and then expect them to apologize to you. That like never happens. Empathy is understanding why that never happens.\n\nEmpathy is understanding that insulting is wrong even when you're insulting someone that has done something wrong.\n\nHope some of that helps you understand empathy a little more.

You gave her an out to drop it and she kept pushing, and saw consequences to her actions. I honestly don't understand anyone saying OP should have been nicer, if someone continues to run their mouth as a guest at their house, the door is that way. It makes me think of how a restaurant has the right to refuse service to anyone, a similar vein applies to house parties with the host. Rude and disrespectful behavior has consequences, and I never understood the impulse to take a passive approach to bad behavior, or absolve people by not holding them accountable for their actions. OP wasn't violent or rude, but they were firm in setting a boundary, and of course some people didn't like that. That's life sometimes, you cannot please everyone. Honestly you did right by your friend, people pleasing would have helped no one once she crossed a line.\n\nAlso, criticizing for their disability no matter how it happened also reads as very ableist. I think its easy to forget as able bodied people how difficult it must be to exist in a world that is actively not set up to accomodate your disability, and to constantly field the rude invasive behavior of others. I'm able bodied, but I've seen the stories of enough disabled people on the internet to know how invasive and hostile some people can be towards disabled people.\n\nThe the fact that she went on her public social media to play the victim and farm sympathy tells me exactly what type of a person this woman is.
