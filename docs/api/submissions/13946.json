She was upset and tried to explain what she said, saying it wasn't fair my friend had such a crappy mom and she was being sympathetic. I told her she was an obnoxious lush, and probably would be the crappy mom because she's a meanspirited person.\n\nShe started to cry, and I found her shoes and gave them to her. She left with her DD, and after that the party was basically over and people mostly left. Sunday she called me, saying I was a massive prick for humiliating her and saying I owed her an apology. I told her to learn her limits, because she is an obnoxious drunk. This morning she made a Facebook post about me. People that were at the party commented, some critical of me and some of her.

Just take the L, apologize, and never say anything so awful ever again.\n\nlol", ">You said esh but only\\*ted on Op,you had only excuses for her , public humiliation, drunk , a sweetheart with the wrong words.\n\nMore projection, sigh. My OP is still there if you want to go and re-read what I *actually* said. Key highlights: \"her mistakes,\" \"has a lesson to learn.\"\n\n>You answer me with false superiority because you think you are entitled to be catered to a logic I do not understand why it exists\n\nYour grammar fell apart here, not gonna try to guess what you meant. The superiority tone came after you established the tone you wanted this conversation to have. You picked your tone first, I picked mine in response. How it works.\n\n>someone says to you to not react\n\nDid I say that? No, I did not. *Yet another thing* I didn't say that you want to pretend I did.\n\nTo say someone overreacted is not to say \"don't react at all.\"\n\nYou continue to think in absolute binary \"it can only be this or that, no other options\" thinking.\n\n>you even said you had no empathy for the blind friend even if he cried.\n\nWhen? Quote me. Break out this false imaginary land you have and look at actual reality and **quote me**. I dare you.\n\n>So really look at yourself in the mirror\n\nI wonder how many times you say this to people vs how many times you've done it yourself.\n\n>you can laugh at me and make fun of me\n\nProjection again. Tone of superiority *is* borderline mocking but I'm making the effort to stay civil and still focusing more on the points I'm making than on my tone. Are you?\n\n>but I\u2019m surrounded with love and loyal people at my side .\n\nAnd this matters, why? This kind of completely unnecessary verbiage indicates you have psychological issues. See a therapist.\n\n>You and her will die alone screaming at the unfair world that never understood you\n\nYou really want that to be true, don't you? Your desire to live in a fantasy world and your desperation for that to be reality is quite striking.\n\n>how rotten you are at your core and that\u2019s why no one is there.\n\nI don't think you're rotten. I think you're disturbed. Again: Get help.", "\nOh so the \u201cblind dude\u201d had to cry so you could give him sympathy because he is a man ?\n\nWhat makes you think he's not getting any sympathy at all? \n\nAnd never said what kind of sympathy he gets , just oh yeah I give him some. But the girl was\n\nMy grammar has nothing to do with this ,English isn\u2019t really the only language in the word , I\u2019m Greek so sorry for bad grammar. You continue with this one to show that you are a deeply troubled individual, that just a shitty person with entitlement to hurt others as you see fit and never defend the actual hurt party . \n\nI hope someone can cry for your loss one day but how you talk and treat people , there is not a chance in hell."]}
