He wasn't born blind, but he was young when it happened from an accident. Saturday night several people were at my place, drinking. My friend was drunk and his story came up. One of the other party attendees was also fairly inebriated. She said that she would never let such a thing happened, that she would be a much better mother than that.\n\nMy friend was obviously upset by what she said, but he didn't verbally respond. It was a really mean and unnecessary comment. I told her that she was out of line, had drank too much and needed to leave. She was upset and tried to explain what she said, saying it wasn't fair my friend had such a crappy mom and she was being sympathetic. I told her she was an obnoxious lush, and probably would be the crappy mom because she's a meanspirited person.\n\nShe started to cry, and I found her shoes and gave them to her. She left with her DD, and after that the party was basically over and people mostly left. Sunday she called me, saying I was a massive prick for humiliating her and saying I owed her an apology. I told her to learn her limits, because she is an obnoxious drunk. This morning she made a Facebook post about me. People that were at the party commented, some critical of me and some of her. But it's mostly my close friends criticizing her and her close friends criticizing me.
