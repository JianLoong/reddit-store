Around that time, I told my sister (F30), that we picked the name Lori for a baby girl. But my sister immediately decided she liked the name and wanted it. I dropped the conversation because I didn\u2019t want it to turn into some weird competition.\n\nFast forward two years, my husband and I were dealing with fertility issues and had experienced multiple miscarriages. Based on doctors' suggestions, we decided to start IVF. My family, including my sister, were all aware of these issues.\n\nWhile chatting one day, my sister mentioned that she and her husband were also ready to try for a baby. Lori was still on our baby name list, so I figured I\u2019d bring it up and hopefully avoid an awkward situation later.\u00a0\n\nI said, \u201cI know I brought this up years ago, but we\u2019d still really like to name our baby Lori if it\u2019s a girl.\u201d And my sister basically said, tough luck, I want the name. I tried explaining to her that Lori had been on our list for so long, and after years of doctor's appointments, bad news, miscarriages, and surgeries, it would mean a lot if we could use the name we picked. I pretty much begged her to let us have Lori, and for her to just pick a different name. She responded with, \u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to play that card?\u201d\n\nHer reaction really hurt me. She then told me we\u2019d just figure it out when one of us is pregnant, and essentially left the conversation on the note of \u201cwhoever gets pregnant first gets the name,\u201d which seemed to be another unnecessary competition.\u00a0\n\nWe started IVF, and it went terribly. We found out we were pregnant (again) and that there was a huge chance we were going to miscarry (again). And it was a rough time because we had to wait several weeks for an ultrasound to know if the pregnancy was viable. During that time, my sister called to tell me she was pregnant, and her due date was just a few days away from ours.\u00a0\n\nBy the time we got the ultrasound, our baby was gone, and I needed surgery. I didn\u2019t make any public announcements, but I let the family know about my health issues and that we had lost Lori (yes, we named our baby Lori). My mom told us that my sister respected our name choice and difficult situation and would pick a different name. However, my sister and her husband wouldn\u2019t tell anyone the name until birth.\u00a0\n\nImagine our shock when they announced the birth of their daughter Loriana.\u00a0\n\nWe felt like their name decision was cruel, and we were (and still are) very upset. I didn\u2019t say anything to my sister because I didn\u2019t want to start any drama \u2014 but I confided in my mom how upset we were. She informed me that my sister and her husband were mad I asked them not to use the name Lori. In their opinion, Lori and Loriana were different enough names, and I am overreacting, and was wrong to ask them to pick a different name.\u00a0\n\nSo, tell me, AITA for being upset at their name choice?", "created_utc": 1673041391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1056go0/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_pick_a_different/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This story happens time and time again. If you\u2019re that attached to a name and don\u2019t want anyone else to name their child that never tell anyone the name, it sucks but it\u2019s that simple. I think you both could use the name Lori and that would still be absolutely fine. I think your sister is TA for even starting the argument in the first place.", "OP, I\u2019m sorry for your loss and what sounds like a very difficult fertility journey.", "Bet you anything your sister will nickname the kiddo Lori just to win at the end at the expense of your feelings. \n\nNTA. But I would never do something like that to a sibling that's grieving.", "NTA. and about some comments, yes, nobody OWNS a name. This is just a matter of compassion for a sister. She has said for years that she wanted a baby called Lori, and her sister should have respected that. There are literally MILLIONS of names out there she could have chosen but NO. She wants exactly that one the sister picked. And when she \"cant\" use it, she puts an ANA in the end. To me she was just being incredibly petty and childish. Like I said, it's just a matter of respect. If OP had never shared that name, sister would never have even considered it, it's not like she also loved the same name growing up. It's just because op brought it up.", "I\u2019m surprised by everyone agreeing with your sister here. I would be very upset if my sister did this. It\u2019s true you can\u2019t really claim a name, but I think it\u2019s common decency to respect a loved ones wishes in such a circumstance. How does she not realize that using that name (and she likely will as a nickname) is going to be painful for you? NTA and I\u2019m really sorry for your loss.", "NAH, don\u2019t share names if you don\u2019t want other people putting them on their own lists. No one owns names, and despite your loss, you still used the name you intended and she picked another, while similar, still not the same. Even if she used it, that\u2019s her choice to do so. It isn\u2019t like there\u2019s only one Lori in the world.  She has a right to name her baby whatever she chooses. While your struggle is difficult, that doesn\u2019t mean you get to call names and forbid others from using them. The first child born ultimately gets the name and it\u2019s up to you if you want to use it as well. You\u2019re allowed to be hurt and feel whatever you want to feel, but to let it affect relationships isn\u2019t acceptable.", "NTA. I'm so sorry, what a nasty thing to do.", "You are NTA. But definable don\u2019t share any other names with her.", "Anyone calling OP the AH here must be missing the part where OP lost their baby, whom they named Lori and would have been due at the same time as the sister's baby. \n\nNow their sister has Loriana (likely with nickname Lori) and OP has a niece the same age with practically the same name to forever remind her of the baby she so desperately longed for and lost. It's not about \"claiming a name,\" it's about unnecessary mental anguish, in my opinion. And it's completely heartless of her sister to put her through that. I can't imagine causing that kind of pain to someone I cared about. \n\nOP, you are NTA. Your sister sucks.", "Why do people tell others their future baby names? It never turns out well. Sorry for your loss. You should let it go.", "First of all, I'm so sorry for your loss and all that you have been through. \n\nYou're never the asshole for being upset about things. However,  the way your sister acted is not kind, but I do believe you can't \"claim\" a name. You can request someone not using a name and they can deny that request.", "NTA. And honestly, people have haven't gone through infertility and loss cannot begin to imagine the hurt that comes with other losses like the loss of the name you chose for your baby who didn't make it (we lose so much when we lose a baby and have to do infertility treatment - it's not just the obvious things, but it's also the loss of how you thought your life would look, the loss of knowing that you'll ever get to experience parenthood, the loss of time, money, and energy, often the loss of things like privacy and certain relationships and the ability to be happy for others' pregnancies and children in a totally uncomplicated way). You've had a lot of loss already, and there are so many other forms of loss along the type of journey you're having, and your sister made it all much much worse instead of supporting you. \n\nI really struggle with all the people here saying you can't \"claim\" a name, but I don't see that as what you were doing here. Amidst unimaginable heartache that your sister will never understand, you were attempting to hold onto one little piece of your dream for your child, which is that name. You were trying to prevent losing yet another thing amidst all this. You were hoping that your sister would understand. Instead of responding with compassion, she chose basically the same name as your lost child and pretended it was different enough to not matter. What she did was cruel.\n\nFWIW, when I was in the thick of IVF, I was so terrified of my sister or SIL getting pregnant and using the boy or girl name that my husband and I had picked out before we even started trying, and I talked to both of them about it and shared the names, and they both quickly said something like \"of course we won't use those names.\" For all the people who think you should never share names or that you shouldn't try to \"claim\" a name, I offer up this story. I think that especially within the context of a years-long struggle with infertility and miscarriage, this is a reasonable thing to do and kind people will agree to not use those names.", "While I get your pain I don\u2019t think anyone should get dibs on names. I also think that your sister could have been more sensitive and I suspect that there has always been some rivalry between the two of you.", "NTA. However- If you want to be petty, I'd spin the name choice and be like: \n\"You named your baby in honor of her cousin Lori? That is so sweet that you want to remember my baby in such a way.\" (pour on the sweetness so much that you're in danger of cavities). then, if she decides to show her colors and be nasty about it, it looks 2xs as bad.", "Sister was an intentionally competitive AH.  One assumes that you are no longer close, if you ever were.  She's clearly not trustworthy.\n\nOn the other hand, in my own family, there were two cousins named David, who were very close in age but had different last names so nobody seemed to care.  Nobody \"owns\" a name.", "Loriana ain\u2019t even a name", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019re going through with your fertility. Your sister sucks.", "You are absolutely NTA for being upset about the name choice. Unfortunately, \"dibs\" isn't a very compelling claim and sometimes doesn't work - it doesn't seem like your sister respects you or your struggles very much. Sorry for your obstacles, and good luck with future attempts.\n\n(That said, I encourage you to use the name Lori anyway. Reclaim it. If, as your sister says, Loriana is so much different then she shouldn't have any problem with it.)", "ESH (more your sis though). This is a miserable situation and I'm so sorry for your pain and being accused of \"playing that card.\" But you can't \"claim\" a name for years without even knowing for sure you'll get to use it. I think Loriana is definitely close to Lori, but at least it is a little different.", "NTA, but is this a hill you want to die on? I'm saying this as someone that had a name picked out YEARS in advance, even before I met my partner. \n\nIs what your sister did thoughtless? Absolutely, but try to focus on yourself and your health, and shut the noise out. You have your sweet angel Lori watching over you now, and hopefully, you get to have a beautiful rainbow baby soon. \n\nI have a sister too and I get that things can get competitive, and like everything is a battleground, but there is nothing I wouldn't do for my niece and nephew regardless of what happens between my sister and me.  So if you can, focus on being the best aunt and your health!", "My heart breaks for you OP. I can only imagine the pain you are going through right now. I don't have an answer for you. If your sister genuinely likes the name I don't think she did anything wrong. We form strong connections to names. My partner and I know what we are going to call our kid (we don't have any at this time) and have said we don't care if others use the names this is what our future kid will be called. I think you are hurting and I think your sister seems petty.", "NTA. Idk if any of yall have kids, but once you pick a name that you like, there is no turning back, that name sticks with you and accompanies you throughout the excitement. Sharing that informacion with your family is supposed to be respected, ESPECIALLY if you lose you child. As a sister, how do you expect your sibling to call your baby's name without thinking about the time that possibility was taken away from her? Your sister is selfish, PERIOD.", "Honestly - my personal thoughts are YTA here. I get that you are hurting, but you don't \"own\" a name. Who would have cared if both of your girls were named Lori? And she changed the name to a variant - a beautiful one that also respected your claim on \"Lori\". So let it go. Love Loriana as a niece and when you have your own beautiful baby, if it's a girl, she is Lori - and these 2 cousins can feel connected by the name - unless you make it horrible.", "10000% NTA. People saying otherwise have obviously never been in a similar situation.\n\nIn the simplest terms possible: her sister copied her dead babies name and tacked \u201ciana\u201d onto the end of it. \n\nIn what universe is that acceptable?\n\nAnd it sounds like the sister only picked the name because she knew it was important to OP. Like, oh, you like the name? I\u2019ll race you for it.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the loss you have experienced OP, and that your sister is pouring salt into the wound.", "Soft YTA because I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. But no one owns a name, and lots of family\u2019s share names. On my dad\u2019s side of the family I have several cousins named Mary, on my mom\u2019s side there are several John Henrys- no one cares.", "NTA. I\u2019m really sorry that you and your husband went through miscarriages.", "Every time your sister mentions her daughter just say oh that's so nice of you to name your daughter after our baby that we lost. Say that every time and I bet you she'll stop", "I knew cousins born a few months apart that were given the same name (first and last, don't know about the middle) and who went to the same high school. They survived having the exact same name.\n\nI can't pass judgement because of all you've been through.  Sorry for your loss. I hope you eventually get to a place where you feel good to live your niece.", "NTA", "You are overreacting. Nobody owns a name, so both could've picked Lori if you two wanted to. It was a mistake of you to share the name in the past assuming it was going to be \"respected.\"\n\nI would say NAH but both you and your sister need to stop making a bigger deal out of this unless you're willing to erode your relationship.", "I'm sorry for what you've gone through with your children.  \n\nThat said, YTA.  \n\nYou can't just claim a name in perpetuity.  If you want a name, don't tell anyone, especially when you aren't even pregnant.  \n\nAlso, its not ridiculous that cousins have the same name.  It can happen.   \n\nAnother thing, did your sister ACTUALLY tell your mom she wouldn't name the kid that, or did your mom try commanding her not to, and she just assumed she would listen?", "NAH.\n\nIt's a common name and they modified to not be the same as for yours.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I had relatives have the same name.

It\u2019s important. A manifestation of your little bundle. What do you think everyone will call your sisters daughter? Certainly not Loriana. They\u2019ll shorten it and blame u for being hurt by hearing the name. Sisters can be such entitled cows. I know mine are.", "NAH", "YTA. I am sorry for your loss. Truly. However, you don't lay claim over names. I also think it's doing your future child an injustice. What if you had a boy? Then they could tell your son that all you hoped for was a girl to call Lori. \n\nDon't tell others your baby name choices and you cannot prevent them from choosing names. It's wrong to ask. You're entitled to your feelings but you're in the wrong here.", "ESH. What are you two doing fighting over a name? Multiple people can have the same name, it's not like there's only one of it. Two cousins sharing a name would not have been the end of the world, but your constant competing over \"who could get the name first\" for years has led to this.", "While I have a lot of sympathy for your situation, I have to say YTA here. First, you don't own a name, anyone can use it. Second, you know how many families have like 8 johns? Third, she didn't use the name, she did in fact change it.

But then auntie OP said I couldn't use that name so I added ana to the end of it so I'm technically abiding by her wishes.\"\n\n\"But you call me Lori...\"\n\n\"Well Loriana is a bit of a long name and auntie never said Lori couldn't be a nickname!\"\n\n(NTA by the way and I send best wishes to you & your partner)", "So what!

That\u2019s an incredibly nasty thing to do. The problem here is not OP\u2019s entirely justified reaction to a selfish and cruel action.", "The way OP's post is written, it sounds like there's a few differences from your situation:\n\n1. They knew right away that there was a high probability of losing the baby and that that was the expected outcome.\n2. They knew the sister was also pregnant and would be using the name Lori for it if it were a girl. There was a genuine chance that this would be their last opportunity to use the name.\n3. They didn't name the baby until after they lost it.\n\nI'm also not convinced OP knew the sex of their baby when she named it for the following reasons:\n\n* OP clearly named her baby before her sister could name hers.\n* The sister sounds petty enough to have named her baby the moment she learned its sex, which leads me to believe the miscarriage occurred before an ultrasound could have revealed the sex of the sister's baby.\n* They had similar due dates so the babies would have been at similar stages of development. If it was too early to determine the sister's baby's sex via ultrasound, it was likely also too early to determine OP's baby's sex via ultrasound.\n* OP did not immediately tell her sister that she was pregnant after learning that the sister was also pregnant. While I get that many people don't immediately share this sort of news, especially when there's a high risk of miscarriage, it seems odd that OP wouldn't say anything if she already knew her baby was a girl and had claimed the name. Staying quiet would mean risking the sister taking the name and based on OP's description of the dispute, I don't think she'd take that risk.\n\nIt is possible that they were able to identify the sex of the baby after it had been lost and surgically removed. But in that case, OP is naming her after she's already gone, which is essentially my original point. They chose to name her Lori, at least in part, so that the sister couldn't use that name. Which qualifies as an AH move to me. Not moreso than the sister, but enough to move me from a NTA to an ESH.\n\nI could be wrong, but that's just the way I read the post. Feel free to find any holes in my logic.", "She had a daughter. Her name was Lori.", "If you like the name just go ahead and use it. So you have two Lori\u2019s in your family - big whoop. I wanted to name my second son Tom, but didn\u2019t because my brother named his son Tom. We see each other about twice a year, and the cousins see each other even less. Unless your family are the only people you see and socialise with, it really doesn\u2019t matter.", "YTA, I understand that you wanted the name first, but I don't think you're right to be this angry. You used the name for a miscarried baby (sorry if this sounds harsh, it's truly not meant to be!) but she named her baby something similar.\n\nIt really shouldn't be any difference as if you'd both had girls and named them the same. It's slightly annoying but not an unforgivable thing to do.", "Unfortunately you don't own a name. As painful as it is, you need to let it go.

I get the whole you \u201ccan\u2019t claim names\u201d but I think it\u2019s completely different in closely related families like this.

They\u2019re now currently trying and are deadset on one girl name which we won\u2019t ever use even if they don\u2019t have a girl because thats their name.

So instead, we said: \"Here's Baby T, we love them so much already,\" and that was that. \n\nOP, I'm so sorry for everything you have gone through, and that your sister is so selfish.", "Me neither.

Your baby is my own little girl's name sake and i'm so proud you decided to make sure my daughter is never forgotten!\" Just go over the top and completely ignore  your sister trying to hurt you by lavishing her with praise and thanks. It'll drive her nuts", "<shrug> everyone is entitled to their opinion. My point is that nobody has a monopoly on a name. You can\u2019t go around saying \u201cI\u2019m going to name my baby X and you can\u2019t use that name,\u201d no matter what your reason is for choosing that name. There are going to be other people with that name in the world. Every prospective parent has the right to choose their baby\u2019s name without getting vetoed by someone else.\n\nObviously the dress analogy is less important. But it illustrates how people get stressed about things that aren\u2019t important in the long run. Who cares if someone else\u2019s child has the same or a similar name? Name your own child and let them name theirs.", "and then when niece is old enough and asks why OP calls her ana, they can explain \"Lori\" is the name of her dead cousin, who you had named years before OP was pregnant with and lost her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP I am so sorry for what you're going through. Please know that NOTHING to do with your miscarriage was your fault. NTA.\n\nTBH I think sister just figured if she gave birth first it would force you to change the name, and if you gave first she would have been like \"YOU DONT OWN THE NAME I CAN NAME MY KID WHAT I WANT.\" After what happened she changed the name just enough to be able to argue it was a \"different name\" while still spiting you.\n\nedit: OP you could also argue that Loriana was named after/in rememberance of your little Lori. Always say how her big cousin must be watching over her (just while the baby is a baby, stop before the kid has identity issues.)", "It's not even the name, it's the cruelty. OPs niece was born within a week of when her baby should have been and bears practically the same name as her baby should have had. Her sister doesn't seem to give a shit that this will forever remind her of what she lost. \n\nI hope for your sake that you've never had to experience pregnancy loss either yourself or with a partner, but it is hell and you would hope your own family would show some compassion in that situation. Even if anonymous Redditors won't.", "Three miscarriages and a profoundly disabled child. How\u2019s that for pregnancy loss and fertility issues? Someone choosing the same name as my son wouldn\u2019t even cross my mind as being something worthy of notice.", "As you said, everyone has their own opinions and, obviously their own ways of dealing with grief and loss. I personally have a hard time being around my cousin's daughter who was born the same day as the EDD for my loss. It's painful for me. If that's not an issue for you, I'm glad you've processed your own journey and experiences. \n\nBut imo, by OP making it clear to her sister that this was something extremely important to her and by the sister still moving forward with something so similar after OPs loss of Lori, she has every right to be upset."]}
