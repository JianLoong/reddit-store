Around that time, I told my sister (F30), that we picked the name Lori for a baby girl. But my sister immediately decided she liked the name and wanted it. I dropped the conversation because I didn\u2019t want it to turn into some weird competition.\n\nFast forward two years, my husband and I were dealing with fertility issues and had experienced multiple miscarriages. Based on doctors' suggestions, we decided to start IVF. My family, including my sister, were all aware of these issues.\n\nWhile chatting one day, my sister mentioned that she and her husband were also ready to try for a baby. Lori was still on our baby name list, so I figured I\u2019d bring it up and hopefully avoid an awkward situation later.\u00a0\n\nI said, \u201cI know I brought this up years ago, but we\u2019d still really like to name our baby Lori if it\u2019s a girl.\u201d And my sister basically said, tough luck, I want the name. I tried explaining to her that Lori had been on our list for so long, and after years of doctor's appointments, bad news, miscarriages, and surgeries, it would mean a lot if we could use the name we picked. I pretty much begged her to let us have Lori, and for her to just pick a different name. She responded with, \u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to play that card?\u201d\n\nHer reaction really hurt me. She then told me we\u2019d just figure it out when one of us is pregnant, and essentially left the conversation on the note of \u201cwhoever gets pregnant first gets the name,\u201d which seemed to be another unnecessary competition.\u00a0\n\nWe started IVF, and it went terribly. We found out we were pregnant (again) and that there was a huge chance we were going to miscarry (again). And it was a rough time because we had to wait several weeks for an ultrasound to know if the pregnancy was viable. During that time, my sister called to tell me she was pregnant, and her due date was just a few days away from ours.\u00a0\n\nBy the time we got the ultrasound, our baby was gone, and I needed surgery. I didn\u2019t make any public announcements, but I let the family know about my health issues and that we had lost Lori (yes, we named our baby Lori). My mom told us that my sister respected our name choice and difficult situation and would pick a different name. However, my sister and her husband wouldn\u2019t tell anyone the name until birth.\u00a0\n\nImagine our shock when they announced the birth of their daughter Loriana.\u00a0\n\nWe felt like their name decision was cruel, and we were (and still are) very upset. I didn\u2019t say anything to my sister because I didn\u2019t want to start any drama \u2014 but I confided in my mom how upset we were. She informed me that my sister and her husband were mad I asked them not to use the name Lori. In their opinion, Lori and Loriana were different enough names, and I am overreacting, and was wrong to ask them to pick a different name.\u00a0\n\nSo, tell me, AITA for being upset at their name choice?", "created_utc": 1673041391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1056go0/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_pick_a_different/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This story happens time and time again. If you\u2019re that attached to a name and don\u2019t want anyone else to name their child that never tell anyone the name, it sucks but it\u2019s that simple. I think you both could use the name Lori and that would still be absolutely fine. I think your sister is TA for even starting the argument in the first place.", "OP, I\u2019m sorry for your loss and what sounds like a very difficult fertility journey.", "Bet you anything your sister will nickname the kiddo Lori just to win at the end at the expense of your feelings. \n\nNTA. But I would never do something like that to a sibling that's grieving.", "NTA. and about some comments, yes, nobody OWNS a name. This is just a matter of compassion for a sister. She has said for years that she wanted a baby called Lori, and her sister should have respected that. There are literally MILLIONS of names out there she could have chosen but NO. She wants exactly that one the sister picked. And when she \"cant\" use it, she puts an ANA in the end. To me she was just being incredibly petty and childish. Like I said, it's just a matter of respect. If OP had never shared that name, sister would never have even considered it, it's not like she also loved the same name growing up. It's just because op brought it up.", "I\u2019m surprised by everyone agreeing with your sister here. I would be very upset if my sister did this. It\u2019s true you can\u2019t really claim a name, but I think it\u2019s common decency to respect a loved ones wishes in such a circumstance. How does she not realize that using that name (and she likely will as a nickname) is going to be painful for you? NTA and I\u2019m really sorry for your loss.", "NAH, don\u2019t share names if you don\u2019t want other people putting them on their own lists. No one owns names, and despite your loss, you still used the name you intended and she picked another, while similar, still not the same. Even if she used it, that\u2019s her choice to do so. It isn\u2019t like there\u2019s only one Lori in the world.  She has a right to name her baby whatever she chooses. While your struggle is difficult, that doesn\u2019t mean you get to call names and forbid others from using them. The first child born ultimately gets the name and it\u2019s up to you if you want to use it as well. You\u2019re allowed to be hurt and feel whatever you want to feel, but to let it affect relationships isn\u2019t acceptable.", "NTA. I'm so sorry, what a nasty thing to do.", "You are NTA. But definable don\u2019t share any other names with her.", "Anyone calling OP the AH here must be missing the part where OP lost their baby, whom they named Lori and would have been due at the same time as the sister's baby. \n\nNow their sister has Loriana (likely with nickname Lori) and OP has a niece the same age with practically the same name to forever remind her of the baby she so desperately longed for and lost. It's not about \"claiming a name,\" it's about unnecessary mental anguish, in my opinion. And it's completely heartless of her sister to put her through that. I can't imagine causing that kind of pain to someone I cared about. \n\nOP, you are NTA. Your sister sucks.", "Why do people tell others their future baby names? It never turns out well. Sorry for your loss. You should let it go.", "First of all, I'm so sorry for your loss and all that you have been through. \n\nYou're never the asshole for being upset about things. However,  the way your sister acted is not kind, but I do believe you can't \"claim\" a name. You can request someone not using a name and they can deny that request.", "NTA. And honestly, people have haven't gone through infertility and loss cannot begin to imagine the hurt that comes with other losses like the loss of the name you chose for your baby who didn't make it (we lose so much when we lose a baby and have to do infertility treatment - it's not just the obvious things, but it's also the loss of how you thought your life would look, the loss of knowing that you'll ever get to experience parenthood, the loss of time, money, and energy, often the loss of things like privacy and certain relationships and the ability to be happy for others' pregnancies and children in a totally uncomplicated way). You've had a lot of loss already, and there are so many other forms of loss along the type of journey you're having, and your sister made it all much much worse instead of supporting you. \n\nI really struggle with all the people here saying you can't \"claim\" a name, but I don't see that as what you were doing here. Amidst unimaginable heartache that your sister will never understand, you were attempting to hold onto one little piece of your dream for your child, which is that name. You were trying to prevent losing yet another thing amidst all this. You were hoping that your sister would understand. Instead of responding with compassion, she chose basically the same name as your lost child and pretended it was different enough to not matter. What she did was cruel.\n\nFWIW, when I was in the thick of IVF, I was so terrified of my sister or SIL getting pregnant and using the boy or girl name that my husband and I had picked out before we even started trying, and I talked to both of them about it and shared the names, and they both quickly said something like \"of course we won't use those names.\" For all the people who think you should never share names or that you shouldn't try to \"claim\" a name, I offer up this story. I think that especially within the context of a years-long struggle with infertility and miscarriage, this is a reasonable thing to do and kind people will agree to not use those names.", "While I get your pain I don\u2019t think anyone should get dibs on names. I also think that your sister could have been more sensitive and I suspect that there has always been some rivalry between the two of you.", "NTA. However- If you want to be petty, I'd spin the name choice and be like: \n\"You named your baby in honor of her cousin Lori? That is so sweet that you want to remember my baby in such a way.\" (pour on the sweetness so much that you're in danger of cavities). then, if she decides to show her colors and be nasty about it, it looks 2xs as bad.", "Sister was an intentionally competitive AH.  One assumes that you are no longer close, if you ever were.  She's clearly not trustworthy.\n\nOn the other hand, in my own family, there were two cousins named David, who were very close in age but had different last names so nobody seemed to care.  Nobody \"owns\" a name.", "Loriana ain\u2019t even a name", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019re going through with your fertility. Your sister sucks.", "You are absolutely NTA for being upset about the name choice. Unfortunately, \"dibs\" isn't a very compelling claim and sometimes doesn't work - it doesn't seem like your sister respects you or your struggles very much. Sorry for your obstacles, and good luck with future attempts.\n\n(That said, I encourage you to use the name Lori anyway. Reclaim it. If, as your sister says, Loriana is so much different then she shouldn't have any problem with it.)", "ESH (more your sis though). This is a miserable situation and I'm so sorry for your pain and being accused of \"playing that card.\" But you can't \"claim\" a name for years without even knowing for sure you'll get to use it. I think Loriana is definitely close to Lori, but at least it is a little different.", "NTA, but is this a hill you want to die on? I'm saying this as someone that had a name picked out YEARS in advance, even before I met my partner. \n\nIs what your sister did thoughtless? Absolutely, but try to focus on yourself and your health, and shut the noise out. You have your sweet angel Lori watching over you now, and hopefully, you get to have a beautiful rainbow baby soon. \n\nI have a sister too and I get that things can get competitive, and like everything is a battleground, but there is nothing I wouldn't do for my niece and nephew regardless of what happens between my sister and me.  So if you can, focus on being the best aunt and your health!", "My heart breaks for you OP. I can only imagine the pain you are going through right now. I don't have an answer for you. If your sister genuinely likes the name I don't think she did anything wrong. We form strong connections to names. My partner and I know what we are going to call our kid (we don't have any at this time) and have said we don't care if others use the names this is what our future kid will be called. I think you are hurting and I think your sister seems petty.", "NTA. Idk if any of yall have kids, but once you pick a name that you like, there is no turning back, that name sticks with you and accompanies you throughout the excitement. Sharing that informacion with your family is supposed to be respected, ESPECIALLY if you lose you child. As a sister, how do you expect your sibling to call your baby's name without thinking about the time that possibility was taken away from her? Your sister is selfish, PERIOD.", "Honestly - my personal thoughts are YTA here. I get that you are hurting, but you don't \"own\" a name. Who would have cared if both of your girls were named Lori? And she changed the name to a variant - a beautiful one that also respected your claim on \"Lori\". So let it go. Love Loriana as a niece and when you have your own beautiful baby, if it's a girl, she is Lori - and these 2 cousins can feel connected by the name - unless you make it horrible.", "10000% NTA. People saying otherwise have obviously never been in a similar situation.\n\nIn the simplest terms possible: her sister copied her dead babies name and tacked \u201ciana\u201d onto the end of it. \n\nIn what universe is that acceptable?\n\nAnd it sounds like the sister only picked the name because she knew it was important to OP. Like, oh, you like the name? I\u2019ll race you for it.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the loss you have experienced OP, and that your sister is pouring salt into the wound.", "Soft YTA because I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. But no one owns a name, and lots of family\u2019s share names. On my dad\u2019s side of the family I have several cousins named Mary, on my mom\u2019s side there are several John Henrys- no one cares.", "NTA. I\u2019m really sorry that you and your husband went through miscarriages.", "Every time your sister mentions her daughter just say oh that's so nice of you to name your daughter after our baby that we lost. Say that every time and I bet you she'll stop", "I knew cousins born a few months apart that were given the same name (first and last, don't know about the middle) and who went to the same high school. They survived having the exact same name.\n\nI can't pass judgement because of all you've been through.  Sorry for your loss. I hope you eventually get to a place where you feel good to live your niece.", "NTA", "You are overreacting. Nobody owns a name, so both could've picked Lori if you two wanted to. It was a mistake of you to share the name in the past assuming it was going to be \"respected.\"\n\nI would say NAH but both you and your sister need to stop making a bigger deal out of this unless you're willing to erode your relationship.", "I'm sorry for what you've gone through with your children.  \n\nThat said, YTA.  \n\nYou can't just claim a name in perpetuity.  If you want a name, don't tell anyone, especially when you aren't even pregnant.  \n\nAlso, its not ridiculous that cousins have the same name.  It can happen.   \n\nAnother thing, did your sister ACTUALLY tell your mom she wouldn't name the kid that, or did your mom try commanding her not to, and she just assumed she would listen?", "NAH.\n\nIt's a common name and they modified to not be the same as for yours.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I had relatives have the same name.

When my partner and I decided we wanted to have children, we chose names, told everyone and it\u2019s been 7 years since (we will try ivf this year) and about 5 other babies born and not once were our names considered and i will fight a family member for my name. It\u2019s important. A manifestation of your little bundle. What do you think everyone will call your sisters daughter? Certainly not Loriana. They\u2019ll shorten it and blame u for being hurt by hearing the name. Sisters can be such entitled cows. I know mine are.", "NAH", "YTA. I am sorry for your loss. Truly. However, you don't lay claim over names. I also think it's doing your future child an injustice. What if you had a boy? Then they could tell your son that all you hoped for was a girl to call Lori. \n\nDon't tell others your baby name choices and you cannot prevent them from choosing names. It's wrong to ask. You're entitled to your feelings but you're in the wrong here.", "ESH. What are you two doing fighting over a name? Multiple people can have the same name, it's not like there's only one of it. Two cousins sharing a name would not have been the end of the world, but your constant competing over \"who could get the name first\" for years has led to this.", "While I have a lot of sympathy for your situation, I have to say YTA here. First, you don't own a name, anyone can use it. Second, you know how many families have like 8 johns? Third, she didn't use the name, she did in fact change it.
