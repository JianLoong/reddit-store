Financial problems can certainly fuck up a persons life, but from what you wrote here, money is not the biggest issue.\n\n- If you wanted to deposit cash to prevent her overdraft fees or whatever reason, you could have done so at the teller window without being an account holder.

It merely means she saw the date deposited and the date it was expected to be released.  And released is NOT the same as cleared.\n\nBut I'm done going back and forth with you because the mere fact that you somehow think that holding a deposit to YOUR joint account until you know it has really cleared is the same as false arrest means that there is no point in expecting a rational discussion.", "I mean, you taking the money out is going to point way more to you being involved than if you had just left it alone.", "I\u2019m going to be frank, receiving money someone ELSE embezzled with no knowledge or involvement of the embezzlement is not a crime. If someone is embezzling from the church, at this point you\u2019ve contacted all of the relevant parties (eg daughter, church, bank and police) and no one has stated any crime has taken place. You have records that you\u2019ve already stated that money is not yours and you don\u2019t know where it came from and your daughter claimed knowledge of the payment and that she was the correct \nRecipient.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re just holding on to the money to make a point. If it is from sugar baby payments it could be from anyone in the church that likes to pay young women for company and / or sex.\n\nYou were not the asshole in the beginning now you\u2019re just dragging it out and moving the asshole territory. \n\nYour daughter was an AH as she should have claimed it when you asked. Now maybe at the time she wasn\u2019t expecting the money to come from a church and had no idea. Additionally she didn\u2019t NEED to tell you what the money was for. I\u2019ve never seen someone so worried about having embezzled funds or Ponzi schemes in their account before. If you don\u2019t trust your daughter why do you even have a join bank account with her?\n\nAlso, you don\u2019t need a joint account to transfer money to someone these days. \n\nAsk your daughter to open and account in her name only, transfer the money electronically (so there\u2019s a record) and move on. If not, YTA", "ESH - you removing the funds makes you just as guilty and part of the \u201cscheme\u201d as your daughter. You should have left it in the account and removed yourself as joint owner instead. But since you removed the funds and deposited into your own personal account, you have made yourself a suspect", "NTA (since you plan to give it back) but how sustainable is this really? You have to watch her like a hawk and protect both her, yourself, and grandkid financially for the rest of her life?\n\nMaybe it's time to let her make her mistakes. She isn't learning anything from you saving her all the time, and one of these days you could slip up and she'll take you down with her.", "YTA. \"I didn't trust my daughter about this money so i stole it from her\" makes absolutely no fucking sense. if it's illicit, you are now in possession of illicit goods, and in any of the billion other possible scenarios where the money is legitimate, you've stolen from your daughter and ruined your relationship. congrats, I guess?", "I'm certain EX has nothing to do with it.  They're ex, because she has been increasingly difficult with irrational demands.  Thank you though for your advice,  I appreciate it.", "100% I'm done.  My heart can't handle what vile shit comes out of her mouth when she doesn't get her way.", "NTA and agree...best to contact the bank and ensure the transaction was legit. I know someone who got messed over from a very similar situation.", "I did notify the bank.  They were more concerned about someone having access to all of our accts and offered no answer what to do with the pending transaction. They said had to wait to see if cleared or shut down all accta immediately.  If you've ever done online banking...thats no easy task.  So I chose to see if it cleared, since she claimed ignorance.  \nWe also tried to reach church during this time to no avail.  I have since spoken with the \"Pastor\" there and they are \"looking into it\".  We'll see.", "What happens once the transfer clears?", "You do understand that your taking that money looks like you were involved/culpable, correct? That's not lost on you, is it?", "If you want my guess your daughters either got lucky with a wealthy criminal sugar daddy (unlikely), she's a prostitute and that's how they launder their money, or she's selling drugs or something.\n\nESH though I think calling the police on your own daughter was pretty darn stupid unless you want to take custody of your grandaughter while her mom is in jail.", "YTA. It's not your problem, really. It's your daughter's money. Just give it to her and wash your hands of the situation...also stop helping her so much or she will never be able to help herself.", "\"Stealing\" funds I may be legally responsible to replace...ok", "Nothing \"hilarious\" about dealing with an adult with adult rights with mental illness, but thank you for your comment.", "Well it seemed the better option, than waiting for her to spend it, then be left with the legal repercussions.", "Yeah, definitely. I only added that because she said she waited for the money to clear then took it out as soon as she could. Taking out at all could be seen as completing a possibly fraudulent transaction. If it wasn't seen before it cleared and needed to be taken out to prevent the daughter from implicating herself further in any crimes she should have immediately taken it to the bank teller and told them the story. That's would be the best way to prevent any further liability on the mother's part.", "To clarify, I noticed it about a week before it cleared.  I called fraud at bank immediately, they did not offer any explanation, beyond it is waiting to be verified and told me to close all 5 accts or wait to see if cleared. I chose to wait to see if cleared , because changing 15+ years of online banking in a week, sounded like a bigger nightmare. \nWhen it cleared I called police in originating location, who directed me to my location and a friend who worked at Bank as well as church. \nI am currently awaiting word back k from \"church\" who is taking their sweet time. \nIf I would have thought about just closing acct before clearing, I would have. .but sadly I didn't.\nI have no intention tion of keeping any of the money, regardless of where it ends up."]}
