We are in a Muslim country, it just so happened that my get together coincided with all these Christmas posts. This happened last Friday evening.\n\nSo here\u2019s the situation: 2 years ago I bought an apartment, and I have been renovating it over these last 2 years. This is the important bit to learn about the layout: once you get in you are faced with a square piece of flooring (think a Japanese genkan), then you go up a step to get into the apartment proper. I made it specifically because everyone here wears their shoes inside unless there is a carpet.\n\nOn the left side there is a wall, on the right there is a shoe cabinet that separates the entrance from where my dining table is. Facing the door, entrance and the dining table is my living room. So anyone sitting in the living room can see exactly what is happening in the entrance.\n\nI invited my family (dad, mom, brother, SIL and other brother) to celebrate finally having my apartment how I want it. They traveled by high speed train from a different city (a 2 hours ride).\n\nMy SIL and I don\u2019t get along, and not because I hate her. I was actually the one that convinced my parents to let my brother marry her, I even gave them some money to help with the wedding. But when I bought my apartment she started hating me. Apparently she thought I should have loaned my money to my brother, since they-as a family- needed to buy a house more than I did (they currently live with my parents while they finish their schooling).\n\nAnyway, my parents and younger brother arrived first since they got the first cab, I offered them slippers, they took off their shoes with no fuss and sat down. When my other brother and SIL arrived, she refused to remove her shoes at the entrance (keep in mind she will have to remove them not even 10 steps in anyway), I remained polite, told her that my house is shoes free, and assured her that the slippers are completely new. She remained stubborn. My brother also tried to convince her but she wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nSo I put my foot down, I told her she either takes off her shoes or stays in the entrance, she turned towards my parents for help, my mom just said: it\u2019s her house honey, just follow her rules. She didn\u2019t like that, and in a fit of anger left the house. My brother went after her.\n\nThey called us a few minutes later to say that they were going back to their city (the plan was for them to stay for the whole weekend), and my brother told me that he wished I was happy with myself.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1672070517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvq5fy/aita_for_making_my_sil_leave_my_house_over_shoes/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her refusal is very rude. \n\nI have the same rule and also once had someone give me a really hard time and I told her, \u201cfine, you can either take off your shoes or pay my housekeeper to come over after you leave just to clean my floor.\u201d\n\nI am personally grossed out by shoes in doors. Shoes are dirty, they drag dirt across floors and floors HAVE to be cleaned from outside shoes.", "NTA\n\nYou *should* be happy with yourself. You didn't let SIL stomp all over you.

She was being childish.", "you are not the asshole, not by a long shot.\n\nFirst of all, I'm going to assume that your SIL is a grown-ass adult woman and not a spoiled little girl, because I know 5 and 6 year olds that behave better than that.

Your home, your rules. She sounds awful and entitled.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house and your request was reasonable", "NTA but is she normally like this?  Did she have the opportunity to change her shoes in private?  Some people are embarrassed by their feet.", "NTA  Glad your mother supported you.  Your brother is probably miserable being married to SIL and is transferring that misery onto you.  It's too bad that he's too immature or too stupid to understand where his resentment should be properly directed.\n\nHold your head up and don't let your bro drag you into any argument.  Everyone saw how SIL behaved and how you did.  No one will forget it.", "NTA she made her choice. Your request was more than reasonable.", "NTA. You made every single reasonable accommodation for having a shoe-free home and you did it far more kindly than I do, because I am known to tell even my closest friends when they walk into my home with their shoes (knowing full well I hate shoes in my place) \"Were you raised in a barn?! TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF!\"  (...and yes person who looks to pick randoms apart on the internet, I'm very fun at parties, even ones in my own shoe-free home) Why anyone would want the outside tracked into the inside I don't know.  I internally cringe when people sit in their street clothes on my couch, but even I know there are limits to what you can expect from people and I save that battle for inside myself (and lysol the couch once people leave.)\n\nThere a few valid reasons for not taking your shoes off in someone's home.

Hope she makes your brother happy but honestly she just sounds like a miserable human being.", "NTA. Unfortunally it seems that your SIL is just jeallous of your achivings and hoped people would be at her side.", "NTA. Also I\u2019ve just learned about giving guests slippers for wearing inside the house as an idea. Do they keep them, like are they disposable?\n\nAnyway OP your SIL is just being jealous and bitter. Don\u2019t sweat it. Your brother is a bit of an AH for what he said to you.", "NTA - But then I really don't understand why people wear shoes inside.

Have they visited your home in the past?\n\nYou can ask guests to remove shoes, but they can decide to refuse and then leave if they like.

You have a communication problem, a relationship problem, or whatever."]}
