She is the only one living with her mother whole every other sibling is married with kids and have their own homes. Her eldest brother lives 2 houses down from them and during the party, his wife was sulking and pouting. Later on, i was told the SIL was rambling about how the house is a wasted on the daughter and mother since they are only 2 people, while she has a big family and its not fair she has to live in a barn. Bear in mind, she moved to her own house years back and its a decent house (also 2 stories but not as grand as the new house). The reason is that the daughter/mother were not in a hurry to leave the old house and she did not need to take any loans nor did she need to share it with anyone except her mom and because her siblings are busy with their lives, they don't bother her much.\n\nThe whole party, the SIL kept picking on everything in the house, while everyone ignored her.\n\nSome people are just ridiculous.\n\nNTA OP", "babe I'm a South Asian that doesn't live in South Asia - shocking i know", "because it is, for those of us who have grown up that way"]}
