This has faded a bit over the years by some small incidents. Jake and Beth have three young children (age 7f, 9m and 11f) and in their eyes, I'm their grandmother. I was always the one organizing family trips, buying the presents for the kids and making sure everybody feels welcome. No one else would take this initiative. \n\nAbout a year before the family drama, I was in the middle of divorcing my (now ex) husband (Jake's father) after a big falling out between him and I. The marriage wasn't going so well for a long time, so the divorce was inevitable.\n\nBeth, who I have known for over 20 years by now however, always remained the ''glue''. She always stayed neutral in family fights and was always the one sticking by my side. My ex husband turned around and we had a very civil divorce. To this day, we remain in (minimal but) good contact.\n\nThe divorce resulted in us having to sell our house. The drama started when Jake and Beth showed interest in buying it from us, which we originally thought was a great idea, because it would stay in the family. From this moment on, I was left in the dark about almost all decisions related to buying/selling the house.\n\nImportant side note: in the same period of going through the divorce and Jake and Beth buying our house, I was battling cancer and was still mourning my brother, who I lost to cancer a year before. I was physically very weak.\n\nIn the days before the final signing, Jake and Beth kept changing the paperworks. Then, suddenly they were in a rush to get the papers signed and when my ex husband and I were signing an official document, one of the amounts on this paperwork didn't correspond with a number Jake and Beth signed. (Very technical, won't go into detail). This resulted in a TAX issue, which affected them in a negative way (12k approx). Instead of asking my ex-husband and/or me what went wrong or communicating in a normal way, I immediately got an angry TEXT with a full accusation. I was so angry that I got accused of something I clearly had no bad intent for and WE didn\u2019t know, so I let it rest for a few days. I decided not to pay up for (part of) these thousands of dollars. They were extremely angry. We exchanged many frustrations towards each other after that, but without any conclusion. Our contact had an abrupt end, which makes me extremely angry and sad, since I don't see them, nor my grandchildren anymore, which breaks my heart. Back then, I was physically too weak to ''fight back'', but have by now regained my strength.\n\nShould I have sucked up a few thousand dollars to help them out with this issue, even though I still believe they were at fault, especially after the way they blew up on me?

The mistake was not on you but on whoever wrote up the documents.", "NTA\n\nYou were kept uniformed about details of the sale, and you were grieving and dealing with cancer. Whatever errors were made regarding the contract were the responsibility of your ex, his son and DIL. You were right to refuse responsibility for their choices.\n\nIf they had been civil about it, you could certainly offer them some money. But the fact that they got so nasty about it concerns me. Who knows what future issue they will use to cut you off again.", "NTA, and honestly it sounds like Jake and Beth were in such a rush with the paperwork so they could rip YOU off, but now it's messed up and biting them in the ass. Possibly even there is no 12k tax fee, they're just trying to get 12k out of you.", "\n>Instead of asking my ex-husband and/or me what went wrong or communicating in a normal way, I immediately got an angry TEXT with a full accusation.

You said you didn't respond to their text and let it rest. And then you decided to not pay up. Did you ever actually have a discussion with them about what all transpired before communicating with them that you weren't paying? I only ask because you said they accused you in the text and if the next communication they got was, \"I'm not paying\", then I can understand their anger. They are operating under the belief you're responsible, but you aren't taking responsibility. But if you explained what actually happened and they didn't accept that, that's a different story.", "NTA\n\nThey were playing game with the paperwork and it caught up to them. They opened the can of worms and expect you to lie in it. Nope. Hard pass."]}
