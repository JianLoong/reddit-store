Me 46 female and my ex 40 male share a 4 yo son. We are separated since he was 3 month old. I am the primary care taker and my ex have our son 2 week-end a month and half of hollydays. This year, my ex decided to go in a costal area by flight and booked his tickets. My son needs an identity card to board. Delays to obtain that official card are great in my country, especially at this time of year.  Me and my ex don't live in the same city.\nThe issue: I aggreed to have my son's papers done and even offered my ex to have them done in my city, wich is smaller and have lesser delay. All i needed was a document from his dad city, wich he failed to provide. He decided to start the process in his city yesterday and needed \u00e0 proof of domiciliation from me, wich i gave him. because i wasn't there during the appointment, the officier couldn't put my adress on my son's card. My ex decided to lie to said officer, stating that there was no court document establishing custody and to just put his adress on the ID card, mom was ok with it. And the adress he gave wasn't even the current one.\nhe called to informed me of this, happy that the document will be delivered in time. I didn't take it well because i don't want inacurate informations about my son in an official document. So i called his city town hall to either rectified the ID or stop it from printing. So now, my son's papers are blocked with \u00e0 big red flag and i have to travel to his dad city, with the proper documentation to remove it. My ex is sending me nasty messages on how i ruined everything with my awfull personality and how he will make sure my son knows it's my fault.\nI was sure i was doing the right thing, but the consequences of my actions are all bad. Fixing this issue will cost me time and money, i will endure \u00e0 smearing campaign from my ex and my son is put in all this mess.

He's not mad that you delayed the trip, he's mad that he f**ked up and you corrected it. When he says \"awful personality\" he means \"waah I can't control or manipulate you anymore and your personality is stronger than mine\" (probably while stamping his feet). He didn't send you the correct document, check what was needed if you weren't present in his city, lied about custody arrangements, lied about your opinions, and finally gave a false address! Yeah you're the person that's awful, not. Sorry it's costing you time and money but you did the right thing. Your son is four. He won't understand what his dad is saying and kids are good at seeing through the bs.", "NTA - you acted peoperly as you should, if the dad can lie about that, then he can lie about other stuff to the authorities.", "NTA - lying to officials about custody and giving false addresses are massive red flags, as is the fact that when you offered to get the ID papers sorted he would not provide the documents needed.\n\nIn my mind your ex is being very shifty in his behaviour and it's a good thing you got involved to get it straightened out", "Even if he did put his address down, why an old one? Is he planning to abduct your kid? It\u2019s all very shifty. I wouldn\u2019t send my kid with him any where out of the country alone!", "NTA. Your ex's lies caused this problem.", "Not only NTA, but also a very smart move on your part. By putting inaccurate information on your son\u2019s official paperwork your ex could be setting up challenges to custody. Please consult with your attorney on this and make sure there is documentation in your legal file about this. It may never be needed, but it may.", "NTA.  Your ex lied about the situation as a whole.  Not saying he's vindictive but lying to an officer about your custody situation can have consequences.  Your son is under your custody primarily and if your ex can't be bothered to correctly get the ID done, then he's incompetent.  You were ensuring that the paperwork was correct and if anything it looks bad on his end as on first impression he's aiming to try to undermine the custody arrangement, which is a LEGALLY BINDING agreement.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" My ex decided to lie to said officer, stating that there was no court document establishing custody and to just put his adress on the ID card, mom was ok with it.\" .. you were right to stop that. Talk to a lawyer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but the consequences of my actions are all bad.\" .. No. The consequences are good: **You refused to confirm that your son is living with your ex. That would have been a huge win for him concerning custody and child support. YOu were right not to allow that.**", "NTA.", "NTA and please go through court for custody and don't forget to tell the court what kind of stund he tried to do.\n\nJust imagine what could have happened if he decides to kidnap your kid? He isn't trustworthy and he is threatening to alienate you from your kid with telling him lies. Once you travel to your ex's city please tell them in person what he did and try to file that.", "NTA but you handled it poorly! I don\u2019t think he INTENTIONALLY committed custodial interference because he kind of sounds like an idiot. Sometimes being swift with idiots causes more issues because they cannot compute logic and sense. You would have had to spend hours hand holding and explaining to this idiot in order to avoid this fallout! A judge would fuck his life up if you took this behaviour back to court! Now that you know what you\u2019re dealing with, upon their return, YOU gather everything you need to ALWAYS be the one applying for SIN numbers, passports, etc because that dummy will get your kid accidentally deported.", "NTA\n\nYour ex was basically frauding the government. On top of that, by lying about the custody agreement, he was creating a \"new\" precedent in the governement system on the custody agreement, which could results in a lot of administrative/legal headaches later on.", "NTA. If your son had been caught on inaccurate paperwork that would of been your fault as well according to him. He is a part time dad who doesn't even want to do those hours.", "This is a legal document.\n\nThe information NEEDS to be accurate.\n\nEx didnt provide documentation when you asked for it.   Was that on purpose?\n\nEx LIED to get the documentation, and  by lying it sounds like he has established custody over your son.\n\nThese are huge RED FLAGS.\n\nNTA.  Your Ex is, though.  I would be concerned about him trying to kidnap you son.", "NTA- he LIED on an official government document. Having incorrect information on his ID card completely defeats the purpose of having one. Protect your kid. If you let this go through, In an emergency, they won't have the right address to reach you. Your ex will get over it eventually.", "No not really, NTA. But a little petty so maybe slightly YTA. Dad is definitely YTA for even lying about adress. But you could have allowed them to go on vacation (I assume it would have been to late for you to do it in your city after the cancellation) then canceled the ID card when they got back. Maybe. I'm not sure.\nBut no, you probably did the right thing now that I think more about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know it very well. I usually try to shield our child from it. But the fact that my little one is now put in rhe middle of cross fire makes me wonder if there was fault on my part.", "It is unlikely to be a fuck up. This sounds like a puropseful move.", "My 1st thought was he was taking the kid away, and she might possibly never see her son again", "He just moved place and doesn't have papers to his new adress. But still had some from is former adress.", "I thought of that but discarded it because he doesn't want custody, to much work and not convenient for his lifestyle. But i will surely keep the paper trail.", "I apreciate your concern but going in court again wouldn't change much. In my country it's considered the best interest for he child to have a relationship with his parents. Being a liar doesn't change parental rights. With no proof of abuse or neglect on his part it would change nothing.", "Thank you for that. I aggree with the fact that his actions weren't as malicious as a lot of posters paint them. He is lazy and immature for sure. And i will take your advice on how to handle my son's papers moving forward. It made me laugh.", "There's no doubt in my mind about my ex's status. I considered redoing the card after the trip but didn't do it for 2 reasons. First one was petty,  why should i have to put an extra work because he failed to prepare properly. The other was fear. What if my son get lost with this ID and nobody can reach me because the adress is wrong.", "Not really how it works. You can't just cancel an ID card...", "Having an ex like yours, the only thing I can tell you is to be honest with your kidlet. Don't tear your ex down, but don't shield your kid from the reality of his parent. If something's brought up, answer honestly and age-appropriately. If your son can't go on the trip with his dad, sit him down beforehand, explain that he can't go because of the ID and that you tried to help get him the card, but there were issues because of how the forms were filled out. Keep things as neutral as possible, but answer whatever he asks. If the truth casts his father in a bad light, then that's his father's problem.", "You're definitely not at fault. All you can do is shield him as much as you can. He'll work out who his dad really is, they always do. He's an adult, his actions/words are his and his alone. You are not responsible for another adults choices. Like others have said, contact our legal team and keep a record. Keep doing what you're doing and being an awesome mum who puts they child first. X", "Honestly this was my first thought too. It just seems so odd to A: not pony up the documents so OP could get the ID done properly and then B: provide false information when getting the ID in his own city. Seems like he would be trying to use the child's ID as evidence of sole custody so he could emigrate to another country", "Do more than just keep a paper trail. Talk to your lawyer. At least get advice on if there are precautions you should be taking as you now have irrefutable evidence of your ex trying to commit fraud to travel with your son", "He might like to let you keep the kid but sue you for back custody - money is always nice. Because he would have had confirmation from you that your son lived with him.", "Contact a lawyer anyway. Better safe than sorry.", "Damn. Then at least have the things he tried with the ID on file. You might need it later on even though you may now not why it fit what.", "Well I\u2019m just returning the favour because your post cracked me up! I\u2019m impressed by him bragging that he committed federal fraud like he\u2019s a genius.", "Does the address include a phone number? I mean you should probably find a way to have him cary your phone numbers instead of id card then. But definitely NTA.", "Aha, you can here in my country. In case it gets stolen or lost etc.", "He actually texted me that he was justified in his anger against me because it was all my fault. I offered to take care of it but didn't delivered, leaving him no other choice to lie to get it done on time. He sees his actions as smart and effective to get what he wanted and i fucked it up. I laughed until i remebered that i have still 14 years to deal with this shit.", "No Phone number on ID card here. Just name and adress. I guess because his name and place of birth is correct, police would be able to find me at some point. But it would take time to cross other official database. Anyway, i crossed that bridge now, my phonecall put an alert on my son's file that prevent any delivery of ID until i clear it. It's officially my mess to clean.", "Sucks that you have to travel to another city but you did the right thing."]}
