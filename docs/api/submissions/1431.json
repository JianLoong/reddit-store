Still in the early stages of planning, as in literally only have the venue booked. We were discussing wedding stuff like guest list and wedding traditions we wanted to have etc, and the subject of my dad came up. I've been with my fiance for 4 years and in that time my dad has met him twice. \n\nFor background, I don't have a good relationship with my dad. We are too similar so butted heads a lot when I was growing up. Then a few years ago, he was found to be cheating on my mum, and I was left alone in the house to literally pick my mum up off the floor and help her. He then claimed it was over, only to be found out it wasn't and I once again had to help my mum. (Side note I don't want that sounding resentful, I love my mum dearly, she's my best friend and id be there for her through anything life throws at her) \n\nAfter he left, we didn't speak for over a year. Eventually, we had small contact again, but it was always me chasing a relationship with him, such as calling by his house after I finish work, or checking up on him. Eventually, I got sick of this and during lockdown I told him I'm done chasing a relationship with him and if he wants to see me that he has to arrange it. Needless to say, I've seen him twice in the last two years. If anyone in the family calls him out on this, he uses the age old excuse of 'the phone works both ways' \n\nAnyway, back to wedding planning, my fiance asked what was happening regarding my dad as 1) him and mum aren't on speaking terms and 2) he would expect to bring his partner, who is the person he had the affair with. I thought about it for a bit then asked my fiance if I'm wrong for not wanting him there because he clearly doesn't care about me, and I would rather my mum has a carefree stress free day and can enjoy herself, and that I don't spend the whole day worrying about how she's feeling. He said it's entirely up to me and that he will support me in that decision if I make it. \n\nI mentioned this all to my sister, who agreed its my decision, but she's let slip about it to my grandma (dad's mum) who is now kicking off, phoning me every day telling me I need to allow my father at my wedding, he has the right to be there etc and now I'm seriously questioning the fact that if I do decide not to invite him, I'm being a giant asshole. Grandma is also threatening not to come if I don't invite my dad. (She agrees he has done wrong but wants me to be the bigger person) \n\nSo WIBTA if I didn't invite my dad to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1667605682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymea5g/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_dad_to_my_wedding/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wanted it to part of a big happy family he shouldn't have broken the family apart.", "NTA. It's your special day and you've laid out clear reasoning why him being there would be more pain than it's worth. Grandma's definitely in the wrong for harassing you like that. If she's known for making scenes you should make sure that she is uninvited.", "NTA. This is YOUR wedding. Leave him out. You have seen each other two times in two years, don\u2019t pick your wedding day to be #3. You and your mom can spend it just how you want it to \u2013 filled with love and happiness! \n\nNote: I am loving the support your fianc\u00e9 is showing. \n\nI wish you the best! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. It's your wedding you get to decide who you want to invite.", "NTA. Your father damaged this relationship and it's apparent that he doesn't care enough about it to try to make amends, so expecting you to just stop holding him accountable, let it all slide and allow him to participate in your big day in the name of \"being the bigger person\" is asinine. Your grandmother needs to grow up and understand that her child has an obligation to step up and behave like an adult if he wants to be part of your life in that way and it's obvious that he has no intention of doing that.  \n\n\nI say go with your gut. Don't invite him (and actively disallow him from coming), let everyone have a good day and if your grandmother is gonna play the \"well then, I won't come either,\" then I hope her couch is comfortable and she has a lot to do that day. If she would rather miss your wedding than accept that her kid's actions have consequences, that's something she has to live with, not you.", "NTA\n\nIts a long way away to be stressing about it already.  You can do as you wish, it\u2019s 100% your call.  My opinion is to put him in the guest list head count for now, you don\u2019t make it sound as though you\u2019re worried he\u2019s going to create a scene.  You can\u2019t undo not inviting him to your wedding and even if you have a small wedding, you won\u2019t end up interacting with him more than a few minutes that day,\n\nAlso, I understand that you\u2019re close to your mom, but it\u2019s not your job to pick her up or stress out about her happiness.  Regardless of age, a child isn\u2019t the support system for a parent during a divorce.  If you decide you want your dad there, your moms job is to suck up her feelings for the day and be happy for you.", "NTA\n\nWeddings are stressful enough without having to try and please everyone.\n\nWhat I would say though is that depending on what kind of future relationship you may want with your father, your wedding could be a beautiful opportunity to heal old wounds and start to build on something. It is most father's wish to see their children get married. \n\nHim not being there isn't something he'll ever forget however if you don't intend on having much to do with him, then fine.", "Ugh. That bigger person crap just makes me ill. If he hasn't bothered to see you more than twice in two years, then why on earth would he want to go to all the trouble of being at your wedding? If your Grandmother doesn't come, that's on her, and if you were to invite him, it would only make the day more stressful for you. I'm presupposing you would not want him walking you down the aisle, so if you do invite him, he and your grandma will be demanding you let him walk you down, and then it will be something else. He crapped in his bed and now he has to lay in it. You have no obligation to 'be the bigger person' and ignore his assholery.", "NTA!!\n\nYour father *is not entitled* to ANY aspect of your life. Period, good relationship or not. You did not ask to be brought into this world, you do not owe him anything. He does NOT have any valid claim to your life, especially not your wedding day.\n\nAs if that mere fact isn\u2019t enough:\n\u2022Your father displayed various points of dishonesty and disregard for his wife and child with an affair\n\u2022Your father chose to be selfish and think with the wrong head\n\u2022Your father knew the boundaries you put forth for a relationship and didn\u2019t listen\n\u2022And *then* tried to actively put the blame on *you* for *his* lack of desire to pick up a phone and simply call his daughter. \n\nYour grandmother is also an AH for trying to guilt you to include someone that you have actively not have a relationship with for multiple *years*, not for a lack of trying on your end. \n\nYour father is NOT entitled to be at your wedding, and if your grandmother is giving an ultimatum, disinvite her as well. Don\u2019t tolerate anymore disrespect or disregard from people who refuse to respect your boundaries.", "NTA it's your day. But I'd stop discussing it with anyone other than your fiance so you don't have to hear about it for 2 years.", "NTA\n\nThis is your day and you can invite who you want. You don't have to invite anyone out of obligation. He hurt you and you don't have to invite him", "Would it be so hard to invite him? Chances are he may not come... At least you invited him.. you'll regret not doing it..", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry that planning this happy day has been stressful already but you\u2019re well within your right to not invite him. You\u2019ve tried with your father and he has put in no effort. I get why your grandmother is upset, it\u2019s her son, but still - you deserve a stress free happy day and it sounds like with him there that\u2019s impossible. You may need to have a sit down frank conversation with your grandmother though.", "NTA. Invite the people you WANT to spend your wedding day with, not the people you feel obligated to. Also, consider not inviting your grandmother - I would not be surprised if your father showed up on her coattails if she is invited.", "NTA. Your wedding is your day and it should be as beautiful and stress free as you can make it. No need to invite your dad. Also, tell your grandma that you really hope she comes, but you understand if she chooses not to. Leave it at that and have a wonderful wedding!", "NTA.  If it would make your mum uncomfortable (I imagine it would) its best he not come. If your grandma has an issue with it she can not be there too.\n\n*note be careful grandma doesn't bring him as a guest.", "Do what makes you and the people you love happy. Sounds like you, your husband to be and your mum all deserve better than to pander to someone like your dad and his mother. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you have a right to not want that kind of stress at the day. If his mother can't see that,  then maybe she's also an unnecessary stress.", "NTA.  Your dad is a deadbeat who wants to be celebrated on YOUR wedding day as this great father that he thinks he is.  Your grandma can pound sand too.", "NTA. Tell grandma you love her and want her there, but you  respect whatever choice she makes and you are done talking about it.\n\nI'm estranged from my dad. Didn't have the family pressure you do, but I do not regret not inviting him to my wedding. I got to enjoy my day and my new beginning.", "NTA\n\nThe worst thing is that he will bring his AP. Your mom doesn't need the pain of seeing her.", "I respectfully disagree. I highly doubt OP will regret it.", "Also as someone who eloped during COVID as I didn\u2019t want to deal with the family drama (similar circumstances to you) I 100% have no regrets and am glad I did not give in to pressure to invite the families and get together an uncomfortable crowd. Your wedding should be about you, for you, and should be a day you want to remember and enjoy.", "I'd say if grandma brought him as her +1, then he wouldn't bring his affair partner.  I  think the other woman would be the big problem.\n\nOP is NTA.   She can invite anyone she wants.   Dad has already proved that his children are not his priority so he doesn't deserve to come.", "That's fair, having lost loved ones on bad terms I may be biased, have a wonderful day/evening or whatever timezone you are in \ud83d\ude01", "I am a big fan of eloping- no pandemic necessary.", "I hear you.
