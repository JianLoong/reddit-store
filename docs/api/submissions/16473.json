That does not sound healthy.\n\nI decided that I should teach things like baking, card games board games etc. So far, he's learned how to make cupcakes with minimal support, and he's learned how to play chess, checkers and 5 card games.

If you\u2019d left him to his own devices, they would\u2019ve berated you for not being more active and doing things with him. \n\nI think the fact that the kid himself had fun, speaks volumes. He probably enjoyed bonding with you, as well as learning new things. You made sure he did his homework, fulfilled social obligations, and in spare time you didn\u2019t just send him off to his room, you actively spent time getting to know him. \n\nSo no, NTA. Not.

It doesn't sound like you are forcing himnto do any of the activities since he asked to do them even when you are not around. On the contrary, it sounds like all the other adults are treating him like an adult who just needs to be left alone instead of a kid who has the innate need to explore and learn about the world.\n\nMaybe you can help a conversation with your husband about why he thinks that just leaving the kid alone with his own devices is a good thing? I'd say that that's how his parents brought him up and he is too busy or just can't be bothered to really be engaged with his own son (maybe due to his own busy schedule, burnout or whatever reasons).

You didn't know what to do nor how to do it, so you went with what was comfortable. While it may not work for everyone else (lazy grandparents), you have laid the foundation for the type of things YOU can do with him. Rather, than look at this like a failure, just know you can have a unique relationship with him. Do things with him that you both enjoy and keep it special between you two. He will cherish baking and terrible accents as an adult. However, I do want you to relax a bit. He will survive if not entertained every waking minute and children do need to learn to keep themselves occupied. When he is doing his on thing make sure he has a snack and water, and when he is bored break out the muffin tins and Monty Python.

Granted I tend to let him decide what he is interested in because when I try to get him to do something he has no interest in, he just staight up can't be convinced.\n\nAnd yeah I let him have his time to play around and use electronics but I always know what he's watching or playing.

If what you were doing was overkill, then he would\u2019ve jumped at the chance to do his own thing at his grandparents. \n\nIt honestly sounds like the grandparents are pissed because you\u2019ve taught your stepson what it\u2019s like to have an involved adult actively interacting with him on a daily basis and now he\u2019s expecting them to get off their lazy arses and do the same", "NTA\n\nThis reads as if eveyone else in his family wants to be bothered by him as little as possible, i.e. supervise while baking instead of Riley sitting on the couch with his tablet by himself, playing card games with him instead of Riley sitting on the couch with his tablet by himself, even your husband just wanting Riley to keep himself busy without any adult to actually spend time with this kid. \n\nDid you accidentially enter a parallel universe where everyone is in a competition to be the worst parent/caregiver for Riley?", "NTA, you sound like an amazing mom!! \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA, when my kids go to my parents this is exactly what they do, card games, board games and other activities like gardening and fishing.

I wish I had more time with him but unfortunately I don't", "This is something we definitely need to consider. My husband's younger brother is gay and my in laws support him totally, but when Riley told them he thought a boy in his class was pretty, they told him that he could only find girls pretty. They're weird af and hard to figure out", "The way I read it, I believe the major complainant was her HUSBAND'S mom, kid's paternal grandmother. I didn't see a bio mom for the kid mentioned in this, so I made an assumption there wasn't one in the picture.\n\nI think Grandma wanted extra Grandma time, and is making up a ridiculous complaint because she's pissed that someone leapfrogged her in the babysitting call list.\n\nI love that older people complain that kids are on screens too much, but then when an adult engages them in chores and games, they \"aren't letting the kid be a kid.\" Can't win for losing!\n\nOP, KOKO.  You're an awesome grownup in your stepson's life, and he's lucky to have you. Sounds like you've found some things to enjoy about him, too. Wishing your family good luck.", "Funny story, he actually asked me to show him how to file taxes because he heard me complaining about them 24/7 \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23", ">Also, what\u2019s up with your title?\n\nI thought it would be okay because that's what the in laws accused me of doing but I'm second guessing that now \ud83d\ude33", "unfortunately he wasn't, he's a nasty old grump", "Then absolutely NTA. You asked, the boy answered. His father expected you to just let him entertain himself for however many weeks, and you felt weird about it. You chose a solution that you felt comfortable with and got enthusiastic assent. It might be frustrating for his grandparents to deal with, but if they weren't spending time with him while he was there, what *were* they doing? I mean, in all honesty, it sounds like you did grandparent activities to me. It's exactly what my parents did to my nieces when they went to visit them.\n\nMaybe his dad had personal reasons for wanting you to take a more distant approach, but that doesn't bode well for your relationship since he didn't express those reasons. His parents are most certainly assholes here. Why beg to spend time with your grandkids if you aren't going to...spend...time with your grandkids.", "NTA- you made him a priority and found things that he was excited to learn. I think that\u2019s about the best outcome possible.", "His father left him with you although you've never met before? For a month? What the heck? \n\n(Don't get me wrong, you're doing a great job. Can't say that about the father or your in-laws.)", "Oh your right. Sometimes when I read these posts and someone is being slightly irrational my mind makes it more rational. It made more sense to me that a biomom would be slightly annoyed step mom was doing all these things when biodad wasn't even there and they could've had kid entire time.", "Screw him, and you need to bollock your husband over his reaction, and insist he supports you. \n\nYour doing some great parenting. You are involving him, and he loves it or he wouldn't be picking stuff up."]}
