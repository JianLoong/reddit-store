That does not sound healthy.\n\nI decided that I should teach things like baking, card games board games etc. So far, he's learned how to make cupcakes with minimal support, and he's learned how to play chess, checkers and 5 card games.

If you\u2019d left him to his own devices, they would\u2019ve berated you for not being more active and doing things with him. \n\nI think the fact that the kid himself had fun, speaks volumes. He probably enjoyed bonding with you, as well as learning new things.

It doesn't sound like you are forcing himnto do any of the activities since he asked to do them even when you are not around. On the contrary, it sounds like all the other adults are treating him like an adult who just needs to be left alone instead of a kid who has the innate need to explore and learn about the world.\n\nMaybe you can help a conversation with your husband about why he thinks that just leaving the kid alone with his own devices is a good thing? I'd say that that's how his parents brought him up and he is too busy or just can't be bothered to really be engaged with his own son (maybe due to his own busy schedule, burnout or whatever reasons).

While it may not work for everyone else (lazy grandparents), you have laid the foundation for the type of things YOU can do with him. Rather, than look at this like a failure, just know you can have a unique relationship with him. Do things with him that you both enjoy and keep it special between you two. He will cherish baking and terrible accents as an adult. However, I do want you to relax a bit. He will survive if not entertained every waking minute and children do need to learn to keep themselves occupied. When he is doing his on thing make sure he has a snack and water, and when he is bored break out the muffin tins and Monty Python.

They're weird af and hard to figure out", "The way I read it, I believe the major complainant was her HUSBAND'S mom, kid's paternal grandmother. I didn't see a bio mom for the kid mentioned in this, so I made an assumption there wasn't one in the picture.\n\nI think Grandma wanted extra Grandma time, and is making up a ridiculous complaint because she's pissed that someone leapfrogged her in the babysitting call list.\n\nI love that older people complain that kids are on screens too much, but then when an adult engages them in chores and games, they \"aren't letting the kid be a kid.\" Can't win for losing!\n\nOP, KOKO.

You asked, the boy answered. His father expected you to just let him entertain himself for however many weeks, and you felt weird about it. You chose a solution that you felt comfortable with and got enthusiastic assent. It might be frustrating for his grandparents to deal with, but if they weren't spending time with him while he was there, what *were* they doing? I mean, in all honesty, it sounds like you did grandparent activities to me. It's exactly what my parents did to my nieces when they went to visit them.\n\nMaybe his dad had personal reasons for wanting you to take a more distant approach, but that doesn't bode well for your relationship since he didn't express those reasons.

The first time my fianc\u00e9 took care of him while I worked (son was 6 at the time) he took him down to the stream to pretend to catch fish and paddle, picked wildflowers, taught him about the different birds they saw and a plethora of things I find incredibly boring. But that boy had the best day and it made me fall in love with them both even more.\n\nYou are am incredible step mother, you keep doing those things and he will grow to feel more loved than if you dumped him on his ipad every day.", "NTA you were treating him like a kid.

Kids, nowadays especially, need direct, hands-on interaction and mentorship.  This perverse reliance on technology to distract them, as if they're all perpetual 2-year-olds on a car ride, has stunted many of their social skills, emotional management, and handed off their value systems to whatever algorithm they're currently plugged into.\n\nI don't care if it's cupcakes or car mechanics or gardening or woodcraft.  The educational system has clearly abandoned their posts in teaching marketable skills or a foundation in academic rigor.  Many schools have even done away with physical education classes for one reason or another.  This has to stop.  Your efforts are wholesome, concise, and with good intentions.

You're doing better than I did at that point in time!\n\nLetting an 8 year old zone out on a tablet until he 'gets bored' isn't actually teaching him to entertain himself.

They have NO IDEA what to do with themselves!\n\nYour husband's parents are dumb and judgemental about this issue.

It's just treating him as a person who might like to do fun activities and be engaged with (which both adults and kids enjoy - and it's a real shame it sounds like he hasn't actually been getting that consistently from others in his life!)", "Honestly the way you are with Riley is how I've always treated kids. I can't think of any I've ever known below maybe 11 or 12 who preferred to sit on an iPad vs doing an activity they found fun and getting attention, though the older kids in that range sometimes take a minute to decide whether you/the activity are fun.\n\nYour in laws' way of handling a kid is more what I would do with an adult. If I had a guest I'd want to hang out with them, but would expect an adult to be more independent and want some time to themselves. Your husband sounds like a pretty lazy/shitty dad. I hope it's just how he was raised and you can bring him around. The kids I've known who had attention paid to them (not to mention life skills) were generally MORE able to entertain themselves when they had to. And kids who are comfortable asking you to do activities with them are more likely to be teenagers who will be comfortable asking for help/advice when they need it.

I raised my boys the same way. \n\nHistorically speaking that is what \"childhood\" is for! My gram said that humans are the only animal on earth that needed 16 years of training to survive lol. You build productive adults by teaching children useful skills in fun ways. \n\nYou can tell all these yoyos to STUFF IT.

Because as everyone here has said, dad and grandparents are really off-base...\n\nYou are employing ACTUAL \"parenting\" - supporting the child's growth and development...by engaging his imagination, his physical and cognitive development, his interpersonal skills, and so many more categories I can't even think of them.\n\nAlso, it sounds like \\*you\\* are enjoying yourself as well, which is what relationships are about - even parenting is a transaction where both parties can and should be gaining something. Spending time with young people can be so much fun! And it can help bring adults back to the wonderfully simple enjoyments of being young again. \n\nSource: Developmental psychologist and very involved Aunt who did all the stuff you are doing and sees the results in a now 16 year old (who is engaged and interested in the world, and who I now get to have an unbreakable bond with).", "Hm. Well, regardless of their gender biases, you did an excellent job with Riley. I used to babysit a lot when I was younger and I did all the same activities you did. They could go play whatever they wanted or we played board games/cards, baked, etc. And what an astute little fellow to learn chess so quickly! \n\nIf he\u2019s into the idea, you could try making a pillow fort together.

I always felt awkward around kids, but I tried my best whenever he brought her around. I didn't see her terribly often, but I'd always draw with her and listen to her ramble in that way only kids can when I did get to see her.\n\nBy the time she was maybe 9, I probably hadn't seen her in close to 2 years. Much to my surprise, she remembered me! When she asked me to sit and draw with her, I told her of my surprise. Her response hit me hard:\n\n\"Of course I remember you. You were always so nice to me.\"\n\nI felt I had been in her life for such a miniscule amount of time. It wasn't any big effort on my part. I thought I'd just blend into the background of her memory, at best. I didn't know I could simultaneously feel so big, yet so small, until that moment.

I'm concerned that your in-laws and husband are seeing anything wrong with teaching your stepson some life skills and games.", "I was getting ready to read some shit. You\u2019re a good step mom and doing the right thing. NTA.", "NTA- When I was 8 my late grandma also taught me to bake and play cards, these times are some of my favorite childhood memories. Your MIL and your husband are weird.", "NTA You sound awesome!", "NTA.\n\nYour not treating him like an adult? These are all things I did as a kid too. Kids are curious, and they tend to learn best hands on. You wanted to spend time with him and that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s also important to teach him how to entertain himself and that alone time is okay if he needs/wants it.", "NTA.\n\nThat kind of \"childhood\" that is supposedly being stolen from your stepson is so ridiciulously overrated it's not even funny. All that happens if that you grow up and all of a sudden you realize you have zero life skills.", "Jeez, isn\u2019t this normal stuff to be learning at that age anyways", "NTA. I have the strong impression that Riley had a lot of fun with you and just wanted to do the same with his grandparents. I have a niece of the same age who also loves to play board and card games with her grandparents. I also really doubt Riley would ask to bake if he wouldn't like it. A lot of children find it enjoyable to help with baking. \n\n>letting him just be a child and entertain himself \n\nA lot of children want to be entertained by their parents and grandparents. Sure they desire some alone time, too, but often they are happier and less bored if someone plays with them.", "NTA your in laws reaction is insane. You\u2019re doing an amazing job!", "WHAT? NTA, the kid actually liked what you did together so much that he did it when you were not around!?! What kid wouldn't rather hang out with someone then be by themselves lonely? This is nuts.", "They're cross because you've raised the bar of parenthood and now they have to step up!\n\nEvery single thing you mentioned is something I've done with my son while he was growing up (admittedly, not all in the space of a week).\n\nNTA and I'm glad Riley has you in his life.", "NTA \nAnd honestly.... you're cool as hell for coming up with fun ways to spend your time together.", "Ummmm....you're doing all the things my mom did for and with me from a very young age. I had to set the table. We played card games (many are good to develop mental acuity). I could cook eggs and grilled cheese starting at 6, and could follow a recipe and bake cookies at age 8. I definitely know about the cookies because we moved when I was 8 and I had no friends and my mom wanted to keep me from watching TV all the time. \n\nIf Riley was having a good time, and it sounds like he was since he wanted to bake at his grandmother's, what's the big deal? Sounds like her place was pretty boring. Maybe if Riley was introduced to new things, he'd do new things and be a well rounded person.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like a caring and wonderful person. Kids love to learn new things and he values being with you. Card games and board games are how I spent time with my mother. Your MIL is a salty cow.", "There's a word for what his family is doing- neglect. Sure he may have 3 meals a day, clothes on his back, toys in his room, but he's being emotionally neglected. I was that kid too. It was always, \"I'm too tired/busy. Go play with your brother/read a book/do something else\"  he's gonna grow up and they're gonna wonder why he never calls/visits", "They're passed off because you spent time with the child??? You're creating a bond??? Fuck them", "NTA. Quite frankly the only person whose opinion here is worth considering is Riley\u2019s. And it seems to me like he\u2019s enjoying someone taking the time to actually do stuff with him instead of leaving him alone to entertain himself until they feel like acknowledging his presence. Everything you did with him is absolutely normal and healthy, it\u2019s wild they\u2019re complaining you aren\u2019t neglecting him enough and now they can\u2019t neglect him either. If your husband is actually annoyed and thinks spending time with a kid is \u201cstealing his childhood\u201d that\u2019s extremely concerning. Do any of them even care about this kid or is it just you?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't make Riley do anything he didn't want to do. In fact, Riley now picked up a handful of really neat and awesome hobbies! I don't get how this is supposed to take away from Riley's childhood- he seems to be enjoying it and its not self-destructive or taking away from any large experiences. He can still watch his iPad and do his own things too, it was his own will wanting to do this\n\nKeep on rockin' it with Riley!", "NTA", "NTA. Let's all just remember that the younger generation are more engaged in a childs welfare than the older generation. The older generation would just let a kid play in the street and hope they don't get run over.\nOP is being a good step parent by being there for the child, educating them and teaching them new skills. Also, it's a few weeks. OP isn't taking away anything from that child. I bet that child didn't feel ignored or unwanted the entire time OP was playing with them or teaching them.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong.\n\nHis grandparents are just being selfish and petty. The upbringing you're giving him is preventing them from indulging their grandson, hence their resentment.

But we've made popcorn at home together, we bake desserts together, my teen is learning black jack (and other cards) from my sister, my toddler is learning how to count and collect things. It's actually really good parenting to plan and do things with your kids. It allows them to learn fun skills while they have a safety net, so when they're 15 or 16 they can learn how to plan and cook and execute a whole meal with safety, so when they're 25 or 26 they can survive on more than just canned spaghettios.", "NTA- you\u2019re not treating him like an adult AT ALL! You gave him fun, engaging, age appropriate activities. Judging by reactions of the family this kid was probably THRILLED to have engagement, attention and love. \n\nI know there is a thing going around about letting kids be bored rather than constantly entertaining them. This family completely missed the mark on that, if that is their intention. \n\nWhat it means is not constantly entertaining them with screens(iPad, movies etc), constantly doing activities, or planning their whole day.  The reason is that children when they\u2019re bored will get creative, play pretend, seek out their own hobbies and entertainment, make friends, go outside. \n\nIt absolutely does not mean ignoring a kid until they tell you they\u2019re bored. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great!", "NTA. I taught my kids to make home made pizza dough, noodles, ravioli from the age of 5. My granny taught me to play poker before I was 10. I must have learned at least 20 versions of solitaire plus gin rummy as well. Plus tons of board games. All of childhood is a learning process. Parenting is teaching your kids and learning from them. You are an exceptional (and natural) parent. Stimulate child's brain in lots of ways. Find out what they like to do thru trial and error. Open their world.", "NTA. You\u2019re a very cool stepmom and I bet he loves spending time with you!", "NTA, you are, in fact, an amazing Step-mom. Because you've Stepped Up where so many in his bio-family are obviously failing him.", "NTA.  You\u2019re giving Harry useful skills and memories he\u2019ll remember.  I also commend you for caring and wanting to make sure you were doing the right thing.", "You actually engaged and interacted with your stepson, an 8 year old, and taught him stuff, and everyone is essentially pissed?! \n\nI guess when he's with them, the IPad is the sitter? That's quite worrisome.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You actually spent time with the child, and he enjoyed it. Start baking with him because he seems to want to do that. Kids love the connection. My grandson comes over and loves playing card games with us. We're the only ones that play. When I babysit, the kids pull out my board games, because they love the connection, the getting together and playing. You are doing great, and the inlaws are way off base. You aren't treating him like an adult, your treating him like a kid. That's the best thing in the world!!", "Absolutely NTA. I wish I had a step mom like this growing up. You taught him a lot and he clearly enjoyed it.", "So, they\u2019re upset that you actually engaged with your stepson instead making him sit around and be bored? You are an awesome parent! Never stop what you\u2019re doing, because he obviously enjoyed it! I\u2019m kind of wondering if they are more concerned with gender roles; like the baking and etiquette lessons. That\u2019s really sad, but what\u2019s more sad is that they don\u2019t think being a kid involves life skills, including baking.", "NTA kids need attention, and you never know when a safe video online will lead to a bad one. Honestly, the kid now has skills and interests that could help him in life or help when stressed. You haven't done anything bad and instead you gave him skills he can use.", "NTA - you're not treating him like an adult. You're treating him like a child; a cared-for child with real, live, attention from an adult. A child who is enjoying that attention so much that he's begging everyone around him to be more like you.

You tried something, and it *worked.*", "NTA. What you're doing is A+ step/parenting. You're engaging the kid, and teaching him through play. You're not \"treating him like an adult\" you're treating him like a valued child. Your instincts in dealing with him were great.   \n\n\nThey should all be grateful for the time and obvious care you're giving your stepson. They're just upset because it means rather than parking him in front of a TV or electronic device, they will have to engage with him more.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with all the other adults in this situation. Your instincts are ON POINT. Yes, kids need to learn how to play by themselves some times, but you cannot leave them to their own devices 24/7. That isn't healthy and doesn't sound like much fun for the kiddo. Kids like to play and learn. When they master a new skill they feel proud. They develop social skills. Nothing you are doing woth him is age inappropriate or parentification. He is obviously enjoying himself if he is asking for the same activties from others. You might not think you know a lot about kids, but you are the only one actually giving him what he needs developmentally and socially. You are doing a great job and Riley is very lucky to have you.", "You did a fantastic job!  The in-laws should come and stay with you and learn a few things!  Sounds to me like they are too lazy to want to do anything with him.", "NTA- You sound like an awesome stepmom. For context.

I hope you and Riley get to keep doing your thing and making good memories.", "NTA\n\nYou are apparently the only adult in this child\u2019s life that WANTS to hang out with him. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing and to hell with the rest of them. I promise that you are making an impact on that kid, just by the time you have given him. I have a degree in child development and what you are doing is what you should be doing. And, how fucking dare anyone complain that you have taught the kid things or that he wants to spend time with them doing said things! Those are shit grandparents. Lastly, I can\u2019t understand why dad thinks playing with a kid is taking his childhood away. Why aren\u2019t any of these people understanding that the kid is happy he has learned to do these things and is excited to share with the people he loves? They all suck. All of them.", "NTA at all. You're actually parenting him. You're raising him. There's a reason kids LOVE to learn what adults do and imitate it. And he's HAVING FUN. He wants to bake DESSERTS and play GAMES. It sounds like they're actually pissed because you're GIVING him a real childhood that isn't a screen (no hate for screens, they have their place) and it's suddenly inconvenient for them to actually have to pay attention to him and engage. That isn't your fault and it's not fair to him to be denied engaging life skills education because people have to pay attention to him like a real person now.", "You sound like a really good stepmom.\nEff the haters.\nNTA", "NTA.

I'm shocked that your in-laws decided this was you stealing his childhood. That's a freaking leap!", "NTA. You literally spent time with him and made core memories. It's concerning that everyone else involved thinks it's wrong and annoying.", "Definitely not the Ahole..sounds like the other way around if everyone just wants the kid to waste away, especially if he doesn't have a sibling or friends to engage with. What else is he supposed to do just sit and watch TV or play on the iPad? Nahhh you did nothing wrong, in fact they need to take notes!", "NTA. You treated him like the child he is and it seems like he loved the activities and engagement! Your style is way more appropriate than the in-laws' or dad's.", "Do they get mad at school for teaching him math?

Please know that you are a wonderful stepmom. You took the time and energy to spend quality time with your stepson. You didn\u2019t hand him an electronic device to babysit him. You showed him how much he mattered by doing activities with him, teaching him new things, and not dismissing him.  He thought it was awesome, I know this because he wanted the same treatment at his grandparents house. BUT his grandparents don\u2019t want to give him the time and attention that you gave him, THATS WHY THEY ARE ANGRY!  They are making you believe that spending quality time with your stepson is wrong so that they can feel better about themselves and continue using electronic devices as a babysitter. \nNTA and I\u2019m a mom with 4 kids so I know of what I speak. \nAnd as a side note\u2026I baked marble cupcakes for my 10th birthday to bring into school (with no help).

I have 23 years of card game memories, and they're some of my favorites.", "I was a young teenager (13 or 14) and was helping my grandmother make strawberry jam. Making jams and pickles was a full-time job in the summer for her up until 7 or 8 years ago.\n\nShe'd used the last of her Certo (liquid pectin) and didn't realize until we got to that step in making the jam.\n\nShe turned the heat down, gave me the wooden spoon and told me 'don't stop stirring it, *do not* let it boil', and ran out to the store. I'm autistic (we didn't know that then) and took directions *very* literally. So I didn't stop stirring. I didn't dare step the literally 2ft away to pick up the phone, even.\n\nJam set up fine, it was thicker than it would have normally been, because the trip to the store was \\~20 minutes there and back. We still talk about that incident.  \n\n\nKids remember those moments and they cherish them.", "Yeah I've been teaching my soon to be 15 yr old how to cook the last couple years. I can't cook all the time due to disabilities so my mom does a lot of cooking. But she went out of town a couple months ago and the entire week she was gone we pulled out our DnD and Skyrim licensed cookbooks and made different recipes from them. I'm 90% sure core memories were made that week. Especially her first time chopping onions. She kept rubbing her eyes and I had to tell her that she was just rubbing the onion juice deeper into her eyes because it was on her hands. For whatever reason they were really really potent for yellow onions, more than normal.", "I get this! This is why I still lay with my 11yo until she goes to sleep (I know, I know).

Okay!!\u201d", "i was expecting some other scenario here that had nothing to do with the basic life concepts you taught him.\n\nlike card games are fun, when i was a child solitaire was a staple since you know ipads and stuff weren't a thing. i still play spider solitaire on my phone.\n\nand let's be honest it is healthy to do things other than be glued to an ipad. sounds like your husband is more worried about his son pestering him to do things thag involve him bs individual occupation.\n\nNTA", "\"that didn't feel right to me\" Ohhh boy, I was ready to throw you to the wolves, but you did GREAT!

I learned to play rummy and cribbage when I was that age (8) because that's what my grandma / uncle would play.", "NTA for how you parented Riley. You engaged with him and did things that he really enjoys. How is that bad?\n\nI do think you can allow Riley a nice mix of doing things with you and him figuring out things to do on his own. I would say that neither 100% unstructured time nor 100% structured time are good for kids. But that unstructured time shouldn't be just leaving him in his room with devices (as you rightly concluded). It could be reading, drawing, watching some shows or exploring some topics on the internet that interest him, or just riding his bike.\n\nBut hands down, between you and his dad/grandparents' approach, I prefer yours over theirs.", "NTA you\u2019ve only spent time with the child and taught him to do a few things. I\u2019d just ask them what they\u2019d like you to say when he comes asking to spend time with you?", "NTA! You hear horror stories of how step parents can be and you\u2019re the exact opposite! So kudos to you for trying to bond with the kid and making core memories for him! Not to mention teaching life skills that I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll pass along later in life! From not knowing how to deal with children, you\u2019re doing great and also learning how to navigate raising a child! You\u2019re doing great, shrug them off and keep going!", "NTA  \nInsist that your husband see a therapist. I guarantee that this is the tip of the dysfunction iceberg and you're about to uncover a bunch of other ways he's never fact-checked his family of origin's weird beliefs.", "Tell your spouse the child wanted to do those activities and had a great time. Ask your spouse why his mother refused the child's requests. Seems rude.", "NTA. There's something to be said about letting kids handle boredom by entertaining themselves so they don't grow up expecting instant gratification or whatever, but there's nothing wrong with spending time together doing things.", "I used to play Yahtzee and poker with my grandparents at that age and help cook Sunday lunch.  They\u2019ve been gone for years and I still have awesome memories. \nSounds like you treated your stepson like a kid to me. Your husband and his parents are advocating neglect. \nNTA", "NTA\u2026I was deeply concerned when I read the title of this post, but your husband and his parents are annoyed because you\u2026spent time with your step son and taught him things??  What you gave him was connection, something children deeply crave and need for healthy social emotional development.  If you\u2019d been pestering the poor kid and forcing him to do things he wouldn\u2019t have shared his new information with the other adults in his life, adults that seem to resent the imposition of actually having to interact with a child that\u2019s been given that gift of connection.  You\u2019re the opposite of a wicked step mother.  That\u2019s so refreshing.", "Nta. Kids need engagement. They don't need it all of the time and being able to entertain themselves is an important skill. You doing activities with him is not wrong. It's ok if he has some chill time too.

You are being a fantastic step mom!  Kudos to you!!!", "NTA. You sound awesome. Kids love attention and are just happier when they don\u2019t have anything to worry about and even the entertainment is provided. \n\nI wish I could give my kids more time. Good for you.", "What a plot twist. You sound like an amazing adult for this kid, and he seems to also agree. Good for you, ignore everyone else and keep doing what you\u2019re doing.

He was obviously excited about these things, since he was asking to do them at grandparents'. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. You are amazing!", "NTA. Those are great things to teach a kid and he clearly enjoyed them as he asked to do them.", "NTA- You admit that you don't know much about kids and instead of just avoiding the responsibility and \"letting him do his own thing\", you stepped right in and PARENTED him! You got super involved and taught him games that he really enjoyed and baking! I LOVED helping my Gram bake and it was super cool when I was that age to measure out the ingredients and get flour everywhere and we would laugh and we created so many amazing memories together. That's what you did for your stepson. You became involved. Do not let your husband or other family members make you feel bad for this! He obviously enjoyed learning new things and playing games and getting ATTENTION! The fact that the grandparents saw him wanting to be active in baking or playing games as \"pestering\" them instead of doing something together as a family is just plain disturbing. Your in-laws and husband should be grateful for what you've done. Not trying to make you feel bad. You gave this EIGHT years old child the attention he's needed! They should be following in your footsteps. Do not allow him to go to the grandparent's home. He's your stepson and you're seemingly doing a way better job than anybody else! Everyone else sounds like the \"kids should be seen not heard\" types and they'd rather he \"does his own tning\" than be bothered to do anything with him! It's absolutely ridiculous. He is being a kid! He's learning games and baking and whatever else you decide to do with him. Hell,, show them all this thread because you're NTA at all. You could have just had minimal interaction with him but instead you stepped up in a big way and a lot of people wouldn't have done that since it's easier to just let them do their own thing. You're doing great and they need to step it up. You've already had an impact on him in a positive way. Instead of being on an iPad at his grandparent's house, he wanted to DO something. They saw it as an annoyance instead of encouraging it. That boy is lucky to have you.
