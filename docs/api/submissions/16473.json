If you\u2019d left him to his own devices, they would\u2019ve berated you for not being more active and doing things with him. \n\nI think the fact that the kid himself had fun, speaks volumes. He probably enjoyed bonding with you, as well as learning new things.

It doesn't sound like you are forcing himnto do any of the activities since he asked to do them even when you are not around. On the contrary, it sounds like all the other adults are treating him like an adult who just needs to be left alone instead of a kid who has the innate need to explore and learn about the world.\n\nMaybe you can help a conversation with your husband about why he thinks that just leaving the kid alone with his own devices is a good thing? I'd say that that's how his parents brought him up and he is too busy or just can't be bothered to really be engaged with his own son (maybe due to his own busy schedule, burnout or whatever reasons).

While it may not work for everyone else (lazy grandparents), you have laid the foundation for the type of things YOU can do with him. Rather, than look at this like a failure, just know you can have a unique relationship with him. Do things with him that you both enjoy and keep it special between you two. He will cherish baking and terrible accents as an adult. However, I do want you to relax a bit. He will survive if not entertained every waking minute and children do need to learn to keep themselves occupied. When he is doing his on thing make sure he has a snack and water, and when he is bored break out the muffin tins and Monty Python.

They're weird af and hard to figure out", "The way I read it, I believe the major complainant was her HUSBAND'S mom, kid's paternal grandmother. I didn't see a bio mom for the kid mentioned in this, so I made an assumption there wasn't one in the picture.\n\nI think Grandma wanted extra Grandma time, and is making up a ridiculous complaint because she's pissed that someone leapfrogged her in the babysitting call list.\n\nI love that older people complain that kids are on screens too much, but then when an adult engages them in chores and games, they \"aren't letting the kid be a kid.\" Can't win for losing!\n\nOP, KOKO.

You asked, the boy answered. His father expected you to just let him entertain himself for however many weeks, and you felt weird about it. You chose a solution that you felt comfortable with and got enthusiastic assent. It might be frustrating for his grandparents to deal with, but if they weren't spending time with him while he was there, what *were* they doing? I mean, in all honesty, it sounds like you did grandparent activities to me. It's exactly what my parents did to my nieces when they went to visit them.\n\nMaybe his dad had personal reasons for wanting you to take a more distant approach, but that doesn't bode well for your relationship since he didn't express those reasons.

The first time my fianc\u00e9 took care of him while I worked (son was 6 at the time) he took him down to the stream to pretend to catch fish and paddle, picked wildflowers, taught him about the different birds they saw and a plethora of things I find incredibly boring. But that boy had the best day and it made me fall in love with them both even more.\n\nYou are am incredible step mother, you keep doing those things and he will grow to feel more loved than if you dumped him on his ipad every day.", "NTA you were treating him like a kid.

Kids, nowadays especially, need direct, hands-on interaction and mentorship.  This perverse reliance on technology to distract them, as if they're all perpetual 2-year-olds on a car ride, has stunted many of their social skills, emotional management, and handed off their value systems to whatever algorithm they're currently plugged into.\n\nI don't care if it's cupcakes or car mechanics or gardening or woodcraft.  The educational system has clearly abandoned their posts in teaching marketable skills or a foundation in academic rigor.  Many schools have even done away with physical education classes for one reason or another.  This has to stop.  Your efforts are wholesome, concise, and with good intentions.

You're doing better than I did at that point in time!\n\nLetting an 8 year old zone out on a tablet until he 'gets bored' isn't actually teaching him to entertain himself.

They have NO IDEA what to do with themselves!\n\nYour husband's parents are dumb and judgemental about this issue.

This sounds like healthy engagement.", "Not going to lie, the only parents I ever met who disliked engaging with their kids like this were drunks, tweakers, or dating those types and taking out all their relationship frustrations on the kids for being in the way.\n\nNot claiming the family is like this, but it really isn't a healthy way to go", "Sadly my parents just wanted us out of the way all the time. My sister grew up to parent the same way and her kids have lots of problems. I make it a point to engage my grand kids in much the same way OP has and they\u2019re flourishing! Stick to your guns. You\u2019re doing a great job!", "right? i mean, yes a kid should be able to entertain themselves (without an ipad) but it's normal for a kid to want an adult in their life to pay attention to them.", "Oh I know, teach him to play solitaire so he can play cards by himself if the grandparents don't want to engage", "I am if he is asking grandparents to do the activities he learned with him, he must enjoy them. Their thinking does not even make sense.", "And chess is a wonderful way to develop thinking and strategy skills.", "Right?! This is what I did as a kid. OP sounds awesome and like the kind of mom friend I\u2019d love. NTA at all.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. \"This kid is going to want to actually do stuff with me now. How awful! \"", "This is entirely it. They are used to him amusing himself and now he's asking for meaningful interaction and they are big mad about having to be present for their grandson", "Took me way too long to find this comment. Why are more people not ticked that the DAD is also mad at all this? His wife showing a new, active interest in his son?!? You\u2019d think he\u2019d be over the moon.", "Well said.", "Sounds like she made some everlasting core memories with this child.  He\u2018ll be so excited to bake with his step-mom all the time.   NTA", "I habe so many happy memories of learning to bake with my Grandma, learning and playing card games. It all started when I was around 5. \n\nI try to fo the same for my kids, more cooking than baking and more binge watching Stranger Things than card games.\n\nCore memories for sure", "And this again! NTA.", "Think of the confidence boost this has to give him. His friends will think it is awesome he can make cupcakes. He's being taught life skills that will help him for years to come. And when you treat a child like an actual person they not only respect and care for you more but themselves as well. So NTA", "I knew kids on the other end of the spectrum: parents too busy with their high-earning jobs to pay any attention. One girl in high school told me that her parents had never once sat down and played with her, her entire childhood. She didn\u2019t know it was a thing parents did. They were practically strangers to her.", "It makes sense unfortunately because they don\u2019t want to be bothered interacting with him", "Sounds like it may be the first time the kid has gotten positive 1-1 instructions/interactions from a parental figure. She could probably teach him anything and he'd just be happy to get the attention.", "He seems like he\u2019s a good kid!!", "This says so much about the relationship between you two, and it's adorable. He wanted to take on something that was stressing you out to try and make it better for you. He sounds like a wonderful kid.", "Riley seems amazing, I'm so glad you got this time with him to build a relationship one on one, because it's very obvious from what your in laws and your husband said, that the kid needs someone like you. He will be better off for it and sounds like he's enjoying it!", "I can't wrap my head around your in laws views. How on earth is baking and playing card games with an 8yr old \"treating him like an adult\"?? It's just treating him as a person who might like to do fun activities and be engaged with (which both adults and kids enjoy - and it's a real shame it sounds like he hasn't actually been getting that consistently from others in his life!)", "Honestly the way you are with Riley is how I've always treated kids. I can't think of any I've ever known below maybe 11 or 12 who preferred to sit on an iPad vs doing an activity they found fun and getting attention, though the older kids in that range sometimes take a minute to decide whether you/the activity are fun.\n\nYour in laws' way of handling a kid is more what I would do with an adult. If I had a guest I'd want to hang out with them, but would expect an adult to be more independent and want some time to themselves. Your husband sounds like a pretty lazy/shitty dad. I hope it's just how he was raised and you can bring him around. The kids I've known who had attention paid to them (not to mention life skills) were generally MORE able to entertain themselves when they had to. And kids who are comfortable asking you to do activities with them are more likely to be teenagers who will be comfortable asking for help/advice when they need it. Tell your in-laws to take thr compliment and enjoy time with their grandson, and tell your husband to be a better, more involved dad.", "Your in laws, no offense intended, are idiotic asshats.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. And a damned good parent. Point in fact I was raised the way you dealt with Riley, having positive learning experiences with adults in my life. I raised my boys the same way. \n\nHistorically speaking that is what \"childhood\" is for! My gram said that humans are the only animal on earth that needed 16 years of training to survive lol. You build productive adults by teaching children useful skills in fun ways. \n\nYou can tell all these yoyos to STUFF IT. And I bet if anyone asks Riley, he much prefers your parenting style.\n\nThis whole business of ubiquitous tech and screens is way out of hand anyway when it comes to kids. \n\nKeep up the good work :-).", "Glad you are second guessing! Because as everyone here has said, dad and grandparents are really off-base...\n\nYou are employing ACTUAL \"parenting\" - supporting the child's growth and development...by engaging his imagination, his physical and cognitive development, his interpersonal skills, and so many more categories I can't even think of them.\n\nAlso, it sounds like \\*you\\* are enjoying yourself as well, which is what relationships are about - even parenting is a transaction where both parties can and should be gaining something. Spending time with young people can be so much fun! And it can help bring adults back to the wonderfully simple enjoyments of being young again. \n\nSource: Developmental psychologist and very involved Aunt who did all the stuff you are doing and sees the results in a now 16 year old (who is engaged and interested in the world, and who I now get to have an unbreakable bond with).", "Hm. Well, regardless of their gender biases, you did an excellent job with Riley. I used to babysit a lot when I was younger and I did all the same activities you did. They could go play whatever they wanted or we played board games/cards, baked, etc. And what an astute little fellow to learn chess so quickly! \n\nIf he\u2019s into the idea, you could try making a pillow fort together. My younger cousins loved those. Maybe a movie night inside it? Or in general, with popcorn and whatever other snacks he\u2019d like. \n\nAnyway, NTA, OP. Keep up the good work.", "Absolutely follow up on this. If baking is so adult, then why are/were products like EZ Bake ovens so popular and enjoyable for kids? One of my favorite things as a child was helping my dad make pies or my mom make cakes. My older brothers taught me how to play poker, chess, and Magic the Gathering, and my dad and I would play hold \u2018em, and my mom and I would play board games together (I\u2019m f for context). Those are the brightest moments of my family interaction as a kid. The near endless amounts of time after I turned about 8 years old, where I was left completely alone to \u201centertain myself\u201d? Borderline traumatizing.\n\nI feel like your in laws are espousing a lot of harmful views. Homophobic ones like said above, but also harmful views about Children\u2019s \u201crole\u201d or \u201cplace\u201d, that could hinder his sense of independence, make him feel like he must be quiet and out of sight, or otherwise like he just isn\u2019t important. \n\nI\u2019m very glad you took such an active role in his life, and that he enjoyed doing things with you :)", "Sadly my parents are like this, and it's where my head went as well", "I think it\u2019s so special that you created these core memories with him!  \u2764\ufe0f Get ready to bake all the time now.  If he\u2019s anything like my kids he will NOT leave you alone until you\u2019ve baked All the things! \ud83d\ude02", "You work 6 12-hour days but suddenly can be home with him for a month? You\u2019ve never met him once? This feels like BS.", "For just a moment, I thought maybe the kid was going to complain to the in-laws about being forced to do activities that he hates. Instead, they're upset that their grandchild is...... (checks notes) *having fun!* The horror! \n\nI'm glad this child has at least one person invested in him.", "This! NTA.", "I mean, I actually hate imaginative play. BUT my daughter and I do tons of crafts together, and board games, and video games. It\u2019s all about spending time together and showing interest in what interests them even if it\u2019s boring as hell to you. Even parents who work constantly can still spend SOME time interacting with their kids. Anything else is just sad.", "...does this kid have anyone who actually wants to spend time with him?", "O0, you really need to show your bf this thread....maybe this will give him a wake up call...", "You may need to find an age-appropriate way to explain to Riley that all adults are different and his grandparents\u2019 disapproval of his new activities does not mean he\u2019s doing something wrong. You may not be able to outright call them boring grumps, but maybe you can think of a way to get the message across.", "Not only do they not want bothered, they complained. Instead of being excited for their grandchild, who was excited to share his new skills, they complained. Instead of being grateful someone cares enough to engage and interact with their grandson, they complained. I suspect why everyone is mad at OP is because now the child is not content alone in a room with his ipad. OP showed him what his life should be like. What OP did is called parenting. Throwing a kid in a room with an ipad is not allowing him to be a child nor is it teaching him to entertain himself."]}
