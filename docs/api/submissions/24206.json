I never cooked for them again. \n\nAnd I hope the sandwiches you feed your ILs are either PBJ or the cheapest bologna your supermarket sells!", "NTA and I congratulate you for sticking to your principles.  Let Dan keep cooking for his ungrateful family - you don't need to be insulted by them.", "NTA\n\nYou said your husband cooks for them when they come over. It's been working for 17 years. Why change now?", "NTA food is a love language. They know it. You know it. They can suck it", "NTA. I wouldn't let them in my house after what they said much less cook for them.", "These people sound uncultured as fuck. Keep holding your grudge", "I just really would love the stew recipe (though I understand if that feels intensely personal for OP), because it sounds baller. I am also not Mexican, but I love good food; who cares where it originated?", "NTA but also they didn't like tri-tip? \ud83d\ude15 I'm from CA and live in a state where no one knows WTF tri-tip is. Every time I visit my mom, I bring back 10 pounds of tri-tip. My husband even watched YouTube videos to learn how to cook it like Californians do. \nSeveral years ago, my husband made green chili for a family dinner. His mother said it looked and smelled weird, and she refused to eat it. She went and got a pizza and ate it in front of my husband. He shrugged it off and said \"that's how she is\" but it's stuck with me all these years because he was hurt by it. The thing that gets me the most? She's a cook. Went to school for it and everything. I will never forget the look on my husband's face. He doesn't like to invite her for family meals anymore.", "What did your husband do when they told you they aren't Mexican and left?", "NTA And your husband is wrong and a soft AH because if he knew how they hurt your feelings he should have talk with them about it and try to mend the relationship. \n\nI am a grudge keeper as you OP and if people are ungrateful as them I wouldn't boil an egg for them until I die, if they were so eager to be so rude they could have apologized. \n\nAnyway Dan can keep cooking for them he had 17 years to try to fix things.", "NTA.  I just can't fathom how people can be so rude as to criticise the food they are served in another person's home.  Every meal that somebody cooks for you is a gift.  To complain about it and call it \"trash food\" simply indicates that they are the trash.", "NTA, BUT.....I'm gonna need the recipe for the stew...purely for evidence.", "nta. curious, what is the recipe for the stew?", "I disagree with your husband. It is NEVER too late for an apology. NTA!", "Why is it too late for them to apologize to you? Surely they know why you closed the kitchen to them, right? Your husband has had 17 years to tell them to just apologize already. \n\nNTA. It sucks that they won't just apologize for being so inappropriate in the past.", "NTA. But maybe let go of the grudge for your own sake whether or not you cook for them in the future.", "I would never cook for them again either no matter how long ago it was.", "NTA but if they ever finally apologize then cook it for them again YTA if you don\u2019t.", "Stick to your principles of not cooking for them anymore also you should probably should have divorced him long ago because I was usually disrespectful to you and most likely your parents and grandparents", "INFO: how do they behave now? Do they still make little digs about your parents' food, or mutter about \"trash food\" when you make sandwiches or a different relative or friend of yours cooks?\n\nThis definitely sounds like a misunderstanding. They were insulted and offended because they thought you were conflating Mexico and Puerto Rico, not that you just made Mexican food on the off chance. They back tracked once they figured out the real reason you made it wasn't because you were a racist asshole.\n\nThey were pretty insulting guests about the meal your parents made, though, so that balances out you coming across as racist. I'd give the original scenario an E-S-H with them being actual assholes, and you being an accidental asshole unwittingly.\n\nHowever, in the now, it's been 17 years. Unless they have continued to complain and snit about food, you're now the asshole for keeping this up when they've tried to mend bridges via praise and olive branches. I have the feeling your husband is not amused and getting pretty pissed and exasperated with you, which is why you're posting this. \n\nYour aren't winning any prizes for continuing and just making your life suck more. Dan likely loses a little bit more of his respect and ability to like you whenever this comes up yet again. \n\nI vote knock it off and take the out they've opened. If you make the stew and they make any negative comments at all, then you'd be justified in returning to the embargo state, and even your husband would agree. If you make it and they praise it, you've drastically improved your relationship with them, your husband, and let go of this stupid rock you've been holding for nearly two decades. Either scenario is a win.", "You kept this up for 17 years? Lol \n\nOk ESH because it\u2019s clear that they have become less ignorant. People change.", "ESH\n\nCome on, it's been 17 years, and you're still holding out for an apology? That's ancient history now. I agree that their behavior at the time was insulting and downright awful. But given your description, it seems that you still see each other now and then since they are, after all, your husband's parents. As they say, you don't have to like them but you don't have to counter their rudeness from so many years ago with equal rudeness. You might be surprised, if you cook the meal they like and serve it with a welcoming face, that you might actually share a nice evening with them. Give it a try, but forget about getting that apology. A forced apology is just a bunch of words that mean nothing.", "That stew has sailed.\n\nNTA.", "Nta they can apologize 17 years later or Dan can cook for *his* parents.", "NTA. I wouldn't make them anything ever if it was me.", "Puerto Ricans I swear", ">He knows they were wrong but says it is too late to expect an apology now.\n\nIt's also too late for those picky ingrates to expect any food from you! NTA!", "NTA. Introduce your husband to the kitchen, tell him he can cook for his badly behaved parents.", "\"too late to expect an apology now\"\n\nToo late for you to expect to cook for them too !", "You're NTA. \n\n>Dan thinks IATA since it has been 17 years and I still will not cook for them. **He knows they were wrong** but says it is too late to expect an apology now.\n\nEnough said. He can continue to cook for them. He has earned that privilege.", "NTA. Why on earth would you ever cook for them again? You tried. You gave it your very best effort, and cooked your best dishes. They hated it and called you a racist. They hated your cooking so much they brought food over to teach you to cook.\n\nI\u2019d insist I was a very slow learner. Maybe in another 20 years or so, you\u2019ll learn enough to try again. Or maybe not.", "You are being way too petty and unforgiving. This is your mates family. Way too long to hold a grudge and definitely not kind. Is this the person you want to be?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to say sorry. They were beyond rude and frankly quite trashy to insult you and your parent\u2019s hospitality like that because of their own insecurities perhaps because they\u2019ve been mistaken for Mexican or people think it\u2019s almost the same thing.\n\nDon\u2019t cook Auntie\u2019s stew for them. They haven\u2019t self reflected and understood they were wrong.", "NTA but I would be extra petty and make the legendary stew the day before they visit and serve it to my family and I'll make sure that there'll be no leftovers so if they come and ask for it I'd say I already had it this week and I'm not in the mood to eat it for a while. Then I'd make it again the day after they leave and post it on social media where they could see it. Caption it with \"Only the best for the people I love\".", "NTA. I can see why that is a painful memory.  \n\n\nI know that it's tempting to want a redemptive moment in which the insulting party falls to their knees and begs forgiveness, but in my experience that is a fantasy. If you do want an apology, someone (you or your husband) might need to map out the chain of events in more detail and explain what's going on.   \n\n\nI get not wanting to rock the boat, and maybe your relationship with your in-laws is fine otherwise. But if it's been 17 years, it's clear that by now you're not going to get an apology unless you ask for one.  \nI have to wonder if mentally it's worth holding a grudge for this long. You do have your pride and you're saying that you would want an apology from them (I would too). But that might be giving them a little too much credit emotionally. They probably haven't connected the dots between that dinner and your current day deflections. I can see how it might be too subtle for them.", "They thought you were making Mexican food for them specifically which could be pretty offensive without the context. When they figured it out that you have your own cultural background with Mexican food they reversed course and tried to make up for it. \n\nI see where you're coming from but that's a lot of pain to hold onto for that long. \n\nLet it go.", "More like 17 years with no apology. \n\nNTA.", "This is a logical observation", "I would buy them taco bell every visit.  From the really bad one.", "A clearly defined hill to die upon. I can support this. NTA.", "Damn OP, you're my spirit animal!!!", "As a Dominican, I think you hit the nail on the head. Your husband should have told them beforehand that even though you\u2019re American in their eyes, you grew up cooking Mexican food and weren\u2019t trying to be racist by giving them Mexican food and assuming they would like it.\nOr explained it when you gave the food out. When I tell people I don\u2019t like spicy food and they get surprised I get mad offended.", "That is literally no freaking excuse.", "The thing they made that you described sounds like what white people thought Mexican food was in the 50s so I am very confused", "If they don't know why you don't cook for them, and keep hinting at it, your husband is sleeping on the job. \n\nHe needs to find some way to communicate to them that you are hurt by their original reaction and you don't intend to cook for them again because the episode was so unpleasant for you. They're never gonna feel bad about how they acted, but at the very least he can work towards getting them to leave you alone. Its been almost 2 decades. They shouldn't still be hinting", "\u2026. I just remembered that I made my sister sign a hand written note promising that if I made her a fried egg sandwich, she couldn\u2019t complain about the taste if she drowned it in ketchup/mustard/franks and would still have to do the dishes I traded making it for. \n\nShe\u2019s an *excellent* cook now but when we were teenagers her modus operandi was \u201cmore is more and if it\u2019s not then it must be someone else\u2019s fault\u201d", "[removed]", "My Puerto Rican husband didn't get taught to do much as a kid because his dad is a throw em in at the deep end with no instructions type, and his mom is a swoop in and do everything for you type. It took a long time for my husband to get confident in learning household tasks. Now he's a really good cook and we made dinner together almost every night. \n\nWhenever he mentions cooking to his mom she's bewildered that he's doing that. Not helped by the fact that on rare nights where he handles dinner alone he calls her to chat.", "[removed]", "They were reacting like assholes. Even if they were offended they could at least have had the courtesy to hear OP out, they didn't. \n\nThey then followed it up with this: \n\n>They \"taught\" me how to cook for them while complaining about \"trash food\". \n\nThen they never apologized. I don't blame OP for holding a grudge.", "I actually believe most \"people of color\" aren't conplete AHs like this rude-as-fuck family.", "But I\u2019m half Mexican and half Puerto Rican. What kind of food should I eat?", "No, I reject that. If she wore a sombrero and a poncho, and played mariachi music \"for their comfort,\" maybe. But I seriously doubt that happened. These people are total heels.\n\nIf you have to strain your neck peering around for racism, perhaps it isn't there.", "Hey Op, I got a question? What kind of stew is Auntie\u2019s stew. I\u2019m trying to figure out what stew did you made. In know is not Menudo because they will hate it if they try it. \n\nPlease and thank you.", "\"For their comfort\" \ud83d\ude06"]}
