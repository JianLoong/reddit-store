Their remarks about Mexico were way out of line and inappropriate (hard to know just how much so without knowing what specifically they said), but I can understand how countless micro-aggressions could have built to that misdirected frustration; their efforts to teach you their recipes are actually kind of a sweet way to try to bring you into their culture and, to their perspective, \u201ceducate\u201d you.\n\nSo with all that in mind, and remembering that they probably weren\u2019t just reacting to *you* but to a lifetime of racism, I think it may be time to let go of this grudge.

Nice OP.", "Just say you will cook for them at their funeral as an offering. The survivors will not get a taste.\n\nYes, I'm that petty. Once you're dead to me, you're dead to me.", " When I tell people I don\u2019t like spicy food and they get surprised I get mad offended.", "And sub those nasty black beans for any and all protein.", "Why didn\u2019t they even try the tri-tip? I never considered tri-tip as an ethnic food. Pot roast to me was always an American dish. \n\np.s. Your grudge makes me proud!!", "My MIL tried to put garlic in the broth/stock I was making for my family recipe Thanksgiving stuffing one year! I almost threw hands! My husband yelled for her to stop. \"I was only trying to help!\" she said. My husband reminded her it wasn't her recipe and garlic didn't go with the other spices that were already in the pot. \n\nMy MIL was Mexican and Indigenous. She put garlic in everything, even if it wasn't necessary. She wasn't a great cook. \n\nShe made chicken thighs once that gave us all something close to food poisoning. She never apologized for it.\n\nShe did, however, make amazing salsa. That was her one great dish.", "That sounds fucking disgusting \n\nIf i am making cornbread and someone puts Mexican spice or something else that doesn't belong in it I'll beat them with my cast iron skillet", "They back tracked once they figured out the real reason you made it wasn't because you were a racist asshole.", "It\u2019s all fun and games until you watch a family member roast their sibling at a funeral for their own mother.", "I wonder if they were making fun of her or something. Cooking like that bc she is American/white.", "Husband is absolutely horrible! How could he stand by and do nothing as she was subject to humiliation and racism by his parents. And now he's actively trying to force OP to cater to his entitled parents' demands and putting the onus on her to fix things. Fuck this guy!", "Found the in-laws!", "It's especially insulting if someone drowns a dish you made in some kind of sauce or other condiments/add ons before they even tried the dish", "Na, more like stab their own siblings in the back and use their deceased sisters daughter to win an arguement and have as a trophy.\n\nI bit my tongue last year at my grandfathers funeral when my aunt left me out of the list of family members he left behind. There are 9 of us in my generation she said 8 and didn't name me but she did remember my children so apparently in my maternal family my children were magically born without a mother. Oh and she also included HER step grandkids and great grand daughter in the list of \"surviving family members\". That stung a bit, especially when my family is always uses the \"we're family\" excuse. \n\nI am just being the \"good girl\" and not making waves until my grandmother passes. Once she goes, it's time to go completely NC, and if they say anything, I will let them have it.", "This! I grew up in SoCal and the salsa I make, I got the recipe from my sister\u2019s teammate\u2019s mom who\u2019s family is from Mexico. It\u2019s been a hit every time i make it for any get together.", "My mom served a lot of canned veggies and cooked everything to death (not just veggies) so it took me a long time to learn to like veggies (and meat.) However she was an amazing baker so that kind of made up for it."]}
