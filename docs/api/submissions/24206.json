I was raised by my white mom and Portuguese/Italian stepdad though my family is diverse as are the gatherings and the cuisine.\n\nI was cared for by a neighbor and aunt, Auntie, who is Mexican, while my parents worked. An early memory is being mad that I had to help her cook while the boys played outside. I came to love cooking with her and Mexican food is what I am most comfortable cooking.\n\nWhen Dan and I were getting serious, his parents wanted the families to meet. Dan had asked that I host a few meals since he lived in an apartment. Only food restrictions was that they didn't eat most vegetables other than salad.I was excited and planned out 3 meals that I wanted to share. \n\nFirst meal, my parents grilled tri-tip with rosemary skewered potatos, chili and sourdough bread.  Second meal I made Auntie's stew. I had planned Portuguese food for the third meal. There were also appetizers, salad, sides and wine for every meal.\n\nInlaws did not like the tri-tip, would not even taste it. They thought it was pot roast and were offended it was grilled. Everything else was weird and unfamiliar so they only ate salad.\n\nNext evening, I served the stew and they started eating while I was still bringing rice, tortillas , etc to the table. They asked positive questions about it, I explained what it was, ( similar to chile verde). They pushed the bowls away, got loud about, \"not being Mexican\" and made racist comments about the food then left.\n\nI never made the Portuguese food. They came over the next day with a big aluminum pot and groceries. They \"taught\" me how to cook for them while complaining about \"trash food\". \n\nMy reaction to conflict is to shut down so I kept quiet and just stood there while they boiled chicken breasts and potatoes in tomato sauce and white vinegar and cooked gross, oily rice. It was not good. The only flavor they added was sofrito and sazon. I still ate it, thanked them. \n\nThe next time they visited, they came to a larger gathering. Something clicked and they figured out who my family was. They also had more of my auntie's stew.\n\nThat stew has become legendary in their mind. They tell people about it, they hint or ask for it every visit, they even offer to buy the ingredients so I would make it.\n\nI never have time or the ingredients and the most I will ever cook for them is sandwiches and salads.\n\nDan thinks IATA  since it has been 17 years and I still will not cook for them. He knows they were wrong but says it is too late to expect an apology now.", "created_utc": 1691529273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15luna9/aita_for_cooking_then_refusing_to_cook_mexican/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t cook for them either.", "NTA. You spent a lot of time and probably money cooking a nice meal for them and they were ungrateful. The racist comments are what really really bothers me. I\u2019m Puerto Rican and I\u2019ve never heard of anyone acting this way when served Mexican food. I would never see them the same ever again.", "NTA- They showed their true colors the first go around! Not only would I not bother to cook for such racist ungrateful buttholes, they would not have ever been welcomed into my home again. Marriage or no marriage! Your husband is fortunate to have some one as nice as you! No way I would have even fathomed the thought of allowing them to cook in my kitchen either!", "NTA, they were DUMB people who made DUMB comments and you are FULLY in your right to cook meals for whoever you want. They were rude but maybe holding onto a grudge for 17 years MIGHT be a little something since I doubt at this point in time they  notice / care and  it might be doing more damage to your own mental health.\n\nIf you enjoy cooking do it but you never HAVE to cook for them ever again.", "Nta\n\nThey can hint all they want, when they actually ask though, tell them that you were offended before and don't really want to cook for them, but it's never too late if they wanted to apologize.", "NTA. They were rude AF and it's never too late for an apology. They should offer a sincere one, or continue enjoying those sandwiches.", "NTA.  Racists who don't learn from their mistakes enough to apologize don't deserve good cooking.  Let them boil their chicken.", "Other posters keep banging on about an apology.\n\nIt's not about an apology, which is just a word that nowadays is meaningless.\n\nIt'\\[s about your in-laws being rude and peremptory when you were sharing your favorite meals with them.\n\nScrew them, Let 'em eat cake.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  \nIt's never too late to choose to be a better person.   \nYou were hurt, therefore you won't tolerate more b\\*llsh\\*t from them, and you've compromised enough.

Especially in your own house.", "NTA, if anyone had refused to eat the food I made for them. I\u2019d kick them out and be done. Being mistreated by in laws is not okay nor will it ever be ok.", "NTA. no excuses for racism. then they \"decided the food was fine\" later and never even attempted saying sorry to you at all. 17 years isn't long enough. it's never too late to try to apologize and your husband is also TA for trying to make excuses for his parents (TA here ofc).", "NTA. It'd be different if they had tried the food and not liked it. But no, they didn't try it, talked trash about something they didn't taste, and came back to format you to follow their ways. No way I'd be cooking for them, after 17 or 50 years.", "Let Dan cook for them.", "NTA if it brings you satisfaction to withhold The Stew from them, go for it. It\u2019s nice to get enjoyment from something so easy :)", "Before their next planned visit, tell them you're making the stew. When they arrive, be washing the dishes you used to make the stew.

Can Puerto Rican people only appreciate Puerto Rica food? Or are you similar to my in-laws who think that Mexican people and Mexican food is trash?

Don\u2019t cook Mexican food for some Puerto Ricans. Thank you and bye", "I am not sure. I think they had only had boiled or steamed veggies so I understand preferring salad to that.

I love roasted veggies!", "thanks for satisfying my curiosity! roasted veggies are great."]}
