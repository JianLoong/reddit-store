You're respectfully trying to keep her head on Earth. I would recommend letting her know that she can apply as a transfer from a safety school into Brown or NYU, if her initial application doesn't make it and she puts in the extra effort during her first year.", "INFO: how did you say it? There\u2019s a huge difference between \u201cyou aren\u2019t good enough for Ivy leagues\u201d and \u201ceveryone needs a safety school because of how tough admissions are. Brown has a low acceptance rate, and it\u2019s going to be really hard.\u201d", "If she doesn't apply to a few 'safe' schools, she could end up with a gap year. Which could mess with her goals in life if she's not super dedicated to continue. Your parents need to grow shiny spines and parent her. NTA", "NTA. Nobody, no matter how smart or accomplished, should simply expect to get into an ivy. You are giving her a much-needed reality check for acceptance season. With the schools she\u2019s applying to she needs to have low expectations to keep her sanity. Safeties are super important.", "my absolute dream is to get into MIT. is it likely? no, but I can still hope. regardless, this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m fooling my self into thinking that I\u2019ll be the exception. NTA. yeah, she might get into brown, but it\u2019s more likely that she won\u2019t. you\u2019re just looking out for her future. NTA.", "This is a hard one for me but I\u2019m gonna go with soft YTA. Realistically you\u2019re probably right. It is extremely hard to get into ivy leagues these days and she would need a very impressive application to get in. Even if she does manage to get in back up schools never hurt. I think unfortunately sometimes being honest makes you an asshole even if the person should hear it.\n\nGoing forward I would advise letting it go. Maybe apologize and tell her you\u2019re trying to be realistic and want her to have a backup plan just in case things don\u2019t work out. She might not listen but that\u2019s okay it\u2019s her decision and some people have to learn things the hard way (or she may learn not to doubt herself if she gets in haha). All you can do now is be there for her if she doesn\u2019t get in and celebrate with her if she does.", "I feel you are TAH, she has been told over and over what she needs to do, and ultimately, it is up to her how she handles things. \n\nIf she doesn't want the backup, then she will deal with the consequences of that choice IF it comes to it. And you will probably be there saying 'I told you so'.\n\nInstead of being negative, try reminding and supporting her to do her absolute best because you believe in her and believe she can do anything she can put her mind to. Tell her it's all up to her. Nothing worse than 'family' thinking they know the future.\n\nIf she doesn't get in, help her deal with her options then. She would likely be shattered and would need the support.", "YTA but a well intentioned one. I am speaking from experience having pulled this same card on multiple friends of mine in high school. There is no benefit in saying what you did. You will discourage a lot of opportunities that they may be the perfect connect for and if you are right you will be an AH if you let them know. They will no remember your intentions but will bring it back up years later about how you doubted them. I would backtrack support tell her to go all in and try to be there as best you can. From my professional experience a lot of \u201csafety\u201d schools have offset deadlines so she may be perfectly safe even if she does not get in.", "YTA\n\nYou are not in charge of admissions, you do not know if she will or won't get in. She is talking about Brown non stop, and you decide to squash that dream? Who cares if she doesn't have a safety school. If that's where heart is set on going, leave the space for her to try....and  maybe fail. There is always next year. \n\nSafety schools are wise, but it's her mistake to make.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\n> I feel bad, but I feel like someone had to tell her. Was I the AH?\n\nYes.\n\nBecause you already had told her before. What made you the asshole is *you kept bringing it up when she didn\u2019t do what you wanted.*\n\nAnd in this case the consequences are in the long run, inconsequential. If she doesn\u2019t get in to any school she could try a community college and later transfer, or just apply to other schools the following year. \n\nNo one is going to care if you graduate at 23. (Or even later.)", "Soft YTA. If everyone is (rightly) telling her these things, she already knows. Better to stay silent with mild, smiling support. Well, if she won't shut up about it, maybe just silent. :)", "YTA. You can tell her she needs a safety without telling her you don\u2019t think her dreams are achievable. That said, you\u2019ve told her at least once, she\u2019s got a college counselor, it\u2019s time to take a step back and just be a supportive sister. She\u2019s clearly not going to listen to you. She\u2019s a smart girl and, if need be, she will learn from her mistakes. As a grown up overachiever who went to the best schools/followed the path etc., I can look back and safely say that taking a year off or going to community college for a year then transferring wouldn\u2019t have held me back in the long term.", "Totally reasonable until you told a hopeful, hardworking young woman she wouldn\u2019t get into her dream school out of your own frustration. For that reason YTA. Yes, she is being a bit stubborn and short sighted. You could have gently continued  to encourage her to apply to a safety school out of an abundance of caution and without being so callous. College apps are hard enough without someone you love putting you down.", "NTA.  You are looking out for your sister - I get that.  Depends on what you want from your sister though... I once 'crushed my brother's dreams' in a similar fashion, telling him he should focus on a paying job than pursuing a hobby he hoped would make money without any basis or plan... it sprawled into something much bigger where he decided to air every grievance we've ever had and ultimately resulted in us no longer talking.  \n\nMy situation is not yours OP, but the point I'm getting at is if you value that relationship, you may want to offer an apology and support anyway (not t hat I believe you should)... you are a realist, she is not.  My personal opinion is you will do better in life.  She will either be right, and your concern is unwarranted... or she is not and she will learn the hard way - and some people just need to learn the hard way.  Don't have her resent you, and blame her failures on you no matter your intentions.", "NTA. Dreams are great, but you need to be realistic too and have a backup plan", "NTA, but it does look like this is a life event she will be learning from rather than heading advice and avoiding it. No stress, just dont push the subject any more if it comes up. Also don't apologise, considering you have most recently gone through the process you have more of an idea as to what's going on. Its on her if she doesn't want your help. And your parents need to help her not coddle her.", "YTA but it was probably needed. you can and should have dreams but should also have a backup just in case. she needs to realize not everything works out in life and you have to prepare for things. it\u2019s ultimately her choice though. if she doesn\u2019t get in and ends up waiting a year to go to a different college it won\u2019t be the end of the world.", "YTA\n\nYou have no basis to tell her she will fail. You're not one of her teachers, nor are you on the admissions panel for any school. It sounds like you *hope* she won't get in, because your friends didn't and you can't imagine she might do better than them. It's one thing to encourage her to have a safety school just in case, another to crap all over her dreams.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't tell her again and Don't say I told you so in any way shape or form.", "NTA. Has she looked at the admit rates for Brown and NYU\\*? Has she checked the average grades and scores for admitted students on College Data? Has she looked at her high school\u2019s Naviance scattergram for those schools? Does she know how many people with GPA\u2019s greater than 4.0 those schools reject? Is she out of her mind? \u201cYou probably won\u2019t get into Brown\u201d is a perfectly reasonable and realistic statement to make to pretty much anyone who doesn\u2019t have an Olympic gold medal and a Nobel Prize. Trying to get her to apply to matches and safeties along with her reaches isn\u2019t being bratty or putting down her dreams, it\u2019s being realistic.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the girl a year behind me in high school who said Wesleyan was her safety school. She didn\u2019t get in *anywhere.*    \n\\*Brown and NYU is a slightly odd combo. Lots of people who really like Brown also really like Wesleyan and vice versa. Wesleyan is smaller and not urban, but the feel of the schools is very similar. She might want to look at it.  But she still needs matches and safeties.", "NTA. She really needs to apply to multiple colleges. You probably could have been nicer, but it's more caring to look out for her in a slightly rude way than let her get rejected later with no backup plan because you didn't want to say anything mean.", "I agree! It's fine to apply only to her dream schools if she's okay with waiting a year and needing to apply to different schools if she doesn't get in. But it's much better to apply to more schools the first time if she has the resources to do so.", "if a gap year messes up someone\u2019s goals in life they didn\u2019t have solid goals to begin with", "Where do you live that a gap year could mess with life goals so much?", "Life\u2019s much easier when you just agree to anything and everything. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a good person though. \n\nOP spoke a much needed truth.", "I dont agree. Gap year can make getting back into school hard. \n\nSure, she may get in but she also may not. \n\nShould have the OP been nice? Probably. Should the parents, teachers, and any \"authority\" figure been the one to say before the OP? Yes. Life isn't nice and setting yourself up for success by having backup plans is smart. \n\nI talked about being an aerospace engineer for years. I still made sure to have backups. People talk about being famous singers, actors, and musicians. Still a good idea had backup jobs and stuff. Time to be real and that Brown will only let so many people in. There is a chance she won't be, and it stupid to hope on that chance.", "It has an acceptance rate of 4-6%. That's abysmal.  It's the same as Harvard's.", "Oh please. So they need to wrap her in cotton wool her whole life in case her feelings get hurt? Better her own family tell her now and push her to make better preparations than for her to end up with the rejection letter with no back up plan at all coz then she is really going to have something to be upset over. OP tried the gentle way several times, at some stage someone needed to give the girl some tough love before it\u2019s too late for her to avoid what could be a missive mistake that impacts her long term.", ">You have no basis to tell her she will fail.\n\nBut that's not what the OP said.\n\nThey said \"I told her she needs to start looking up other colleges because she probably won't be getting into Brown.\"\n\n...which is excellent advice.", "I disagree with this statement. If you have solid goals a gap year will most likely mess your goals up for you (I\u2019m not saying it will mess it up entirely, but it will to some extent). For example, I\u2019m in med school, and the 1st year we need to have 80% of the ECTS. I had some personal issues and all, which led to me not being consistent with studying and sadly not reaching the 80%, which meant I had to reach that 80% the next year, and only then would I be able to participate in exams of the second year. This means that you basically \u201close\u201d a year, which is what a gap year would be for some. This messed me up because I do have goals and now I was a year behind. Of course I\u2019m still gonna reach my goals (to an extent), but it\u2019s not gonna be what I originally wanted (for example finishing med school at a certain age, etc.)", "OP spoke a half truth the need to apply to multiple schools through an assumed truth because they will need to. They could have found a way to approach it from a different angle to have gotten their same point across such as looking at a state school that specializes in the sisters interest so instead of it being a safety school it is equally appealing but not as unobtainable. Tact does matter", "Sure, she should have back ups. But she has been told this repeatedly, and has not acted on it. She knows and is choosing to ignore advice because her mind is set. I'm not saying it's a great place, it's not, but she doesn't want alternatives or back ups. Who is to say she would even go to them if it came to it.\n\nI'm just saying she could get in, and if she doesn't than it's her mistake to make. It is not an excuse for OP to straight up squash her dreams, no matter how well intentioned.", "I see where you are coming from but I don\u2019t agree with you. Because I went to the top school in my country at 17 and graduated with my bachelors at 21 and was like well wtf now lol. Everyone\u2019s story is different. There\u2019s no guarantees how this will turn out for OPs sister. Gap years work out fine for many people. That being said I do agree that you\u2019re right that a backup plan never ever hurts and people should have one. But 17 year olds are also allowed to make mistakes and shouldn\u2019t have to decide every life decision as a teenager."]}
