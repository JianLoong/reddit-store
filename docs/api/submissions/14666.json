You're respectfully trying to keep her head on Earth. I would recommend letting her know that she can apply as a transfer from a safety school into Brown or NYU, if her initial application doesn't make it and she puts in the extra effort during her first year.", "INFO: how did you say it? There\u2019s a huge difference between \u201cyou aren\u2019t good enough for Ivy leagues\u201d and \u201ceveryone needs a safety school because of how tough admissions are. Brown has a low acceptance rate, and it\u2019s going to be really hard.\u201d", "If she doesn't apply to a few 'safe' schools, she could end up with a gap year. Which could mess with her goals in life if she's not super dedicated to continue. Your parents need to grow shiny spines and parent her. NTA", "NTA. Nobody, no matter how smart or accomplished, should simply expect to get into an ivy. You are giving her a much-needed reality check for acceptance season. With the schools she\u2019s applying to she needs to have low expectations to keep her sanity. Safeties are super important.", "my absolute dream is to get into MIT. is it likely? no, but I can still hope. regardless, this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m fooling my self into thinking that I\u2019ll be the exception. NTA. yeah, she might get into brown, but it\u2019s more likely that she won\u2019t. you\u2019re just looking out for her future. NTA.", "This is a hard one for me but I\u2019m gonna go with soft YTA. Realistically you\u2019re probably right. It is extremely hard to get into ivy leagues these days and she would need a very impressive application to get in. Even if she does manage to get in back up schools never hurt. I think unfortunately sometimes being honest makes you an asshole even if the person should hear it.\n\nGoing forward I would advise letting it go. Maybe apologize and tell her you\u2019re trying to be realistic and want her to have a backup plan just in case things don\u2019t work out. She might not listen but that\u2019s okay it\u2019s her decision and some people have to learn things the hard way (or she may learn not to doubt herself if she gets in haha). All you can do now is be there for her if she doesn\u2019t get in and celebrate with her if she does.", "I feel you are TAH, she has been told over and over what she needs to do, and ultimately, it is up to her how she handles things. \n\nIf she doesn't want the backup, then she will deal with the consequences of that choice IF it comes to it. And you will probably be there saying 'I told you so'.\n\nInstead of being negative, try reminding and supporting her to do her absolute best because you believe in her and believe she can do anything she can put her mind to. Tell her it's all up to her. Nothing worse than 'family' thinking they know the future.\n\nIf she doesn't get in, help her deal with her options then. She would likely be shattered and would need the support.", "YTA but a well intentioned one. I am speaking from experience having pulled this same card on multiple friends of mine in high school. There is no benefit in saying what you did. You will discourage a lot of opportunities that they may be the perfect connect for and if you are right you will be an AH if you let them know. They will no remember your intentions but will bring it back up years later about how you doubted them. I would backtrack support tell her to go all in and try to be there as best you can. From my professional experience a lot of \u201csafety\u201d schools have offset deadlines so she may be perfectly safe even if she does not get in.", "YTA\n\nYou are not in charge of admissions, you do not know if she will or won't get in. She is talking about Brown non stop, and you decide to squash that dream? Who cares if she doesn't have a safety school. If that's where heart is set on going, leave the space for her to try....and  maybe fail. There is always next year. \n\nSafety schools are wise, but it's her mistake to make.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\n> I feel bad, but I feel like someone had to tell her. Was I the AH?\n\nYes.\n\nBecause you already had told her before. What made you the asshole is *you kept bringing it up when she didn\u2019t do what you wanted.*\n\nAnd in this case the consequences are in the long run, inconsequential. If she doesn\u2019t get in to any school she could try a community college and later transfer, or just apply to other schools the following year. \n\nNo one is going to care if you graduate at 23. (Or even later.)", "Soft YTA. If everyone is (rightly) telling her these things, she already knows. Better to stay silent with mild, smiling support. Well, if she won't shut up about it, maybe just silent. :)", "YTA. You can tell her she needs a safety without telling her you don\u2019t think her dreams are achievable. That said, you\u2019ve told her at least once, she\u2019s got a college counselor, it\u2019s time to take a step back and just be a supportive sister. She\u2019s clearly not going to listen to you. She\u2019s a smart girl and, if need be, she will learn from her mistakes. As a grown up overachiever who went to the best schools/followed the path etc., I can look back and safely say that taking a year off or going to community college for a year then transferring wouldn\u2019t have held me back in the long term.", "Totally reasonable until you told a hopeful, hardworking young woman she wouldn\u2019t get into her dream school out of your own frustration. For that reason YTA. Yes, she is being a bit stubborn and short sighted. You could have gently continued  to encourage her to apply to a safety school out of an abundance of caution and without being so callous. College apps are hard enough without someone you love putting you down.", "NTA.  You are looking out for your sister - I get that.  Depends on what you want from your sister though... I once 'crushed my brother's dreams' in a similar fashion, telling him he should focus on a paying job than pursuing a hobby he hoped would make money without any basis or plan... it sprawled into something much bigger where he decided to air every grievance we've ever had and ultimately resulted in us no longer talking.  \n\nMy situation is not yours OP, but the point I'm getting at is if you value that relationship, you may want to offer an apology and support anyway (not t hat I believe you should)... you are a realist, she is not.  My personal opinion is you will do better in life.  She will either be right, and your concern is unwarranted... or she is not and she will learn the hard way - and some people just need to learn the hard way.  Don't have her resent you, and blame her failures on you no matter your intentions.", "NTA. Dreams are great, but you need to be realistic too and have a backup plan", "NTA, but it does look like this is a life event she will be learning from rather than heading advice and avoiding it. No stress, just dont push the subject any more if it comes up. Also don't apologise, considering you have most recently gone through the process you have more of an idea as to what's going on. Its on her if she doesn't want your help. And your parents need to help her not coddle her.", "YTA but it was probably needed. you can and should have dreams but should also have a backup just in case. she needs to realize not everything works out in life and you have to prepare for things. it\u2019s ultimately her choice though. if she doesn\u2019t get in and ends up waiting a year to go to a different college it won\u2019t be the end of the world.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't tell her again and Don't say I told you so in any way shape or form.", "NTA. Has she looked at the admit rates for Brown and NYU\\*? Has she checked the average grades and scores for admitted students on College Data? Has she looked at her high school\u2019s Naviance scattergram for those schools? Does she know how many people with GPA\u2019s greater than 4.0 those schools reject? Is she out of her mind? \u201cYou probably won\u2019t get into Brown\u201d is a perfectly reasonable and realistic statement to make to pretty much anyone who doesn\u2019t have an Olympic gold medal and a Nobel Prize. Trying to get her to apply to matches and safeties along with her reaches isn\u2019t being bratty or putting down her dreams, it\u2019s being realistic.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the girl a year behind me in high school who said Wesleyan was her safety school. She didn\u2019t get in *anywhere.*    \n\\*Brown and NYU is a slightly odd combo. Lots of people who really like Brown also really like Wesleyan and vice versa. Wesleyan is smaller and not urban, but the feel of the schools is very similar. She might want to look at it.  But she still needs matches and safeties.", "NTA. She really needs to apply to multiple colleges. You probably could have been nicer, but it's more caring to look out for her in a slightly rude way than let her get rejected later with no backup plan because you didn't want to say anything mean.", "I agree! It's fine to apply only to her dream schools if she's okay with waiting a year and needing to apply to different schools if she doesn't get in. But it's much better to apply to more schools the first time if she has the resources to do so.", "if a gap year messes up someone\u2019s goals in life they didn\u2019t have solid goals to begin with", "Where do you live that a gap year could mess with life goals so much?", "Life\u2019s much easier when you just agree to anything and everything. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a good person though. \n\nOP spoke a much needed truth.", "I dont agree. Gap year can make getting back into school hard. \n\nSure, she may get in but she also may not. \n\nShould have the OP been nice? Probably. Should the parents, teachers, and any \"authority\" figure been the one to say before the OP? Yes. Life isn't nice and setting yourself up for success by having backup plans is smart. \n\nI talked about being an aerospace engineer for years. I still made sure to have backups. People talk about being famous singers, actors, and musicians. Still a good idea had backup jobs and stuff. Time to be real and that Brown will only let so many people in. There is a chance she won't be, and it stupid to hope on that chance.", "It has an acceptance rate of 4-6%. That's abysmal.  It's the same as Harvard's.", "Oh please. So they need to wrap her in cotton wool her whole life in case her feelings get hurt? Better her own family tell her now and push her to make better preparations than for her to end up with the rejection letter with no back up plan at all coz then she is really going to have something to be upset over. OP tried the gentle way several times, at some stage someone needed to give the girl some tough love before it\u2019s too late for her to avoid what could be a missive mistake that impacts her long term.", ">You have no basis to tell her she will fail.\n\nBut that's not what the OP said.\n\nThey said \"I told her she needs to start looking up other colleges because she probably won't be getting into Brown.\"\n\n...which is excellent advice.", "I disagree with this statement. If you have solid goals a gap year will most likely mess your goals up for you (I\u2019m not saying it will mess it up entirely, but it will to some extent). For example, I\u2019m in med school, and the 1st year we need to have 80% of the ECTS. I had some personal issues and all, which led to me not being consistent with studying and sadly not reaching the 80%, which meant I had to reach that 80% the next year, and only then would I be able to participate in exams of the second year. This means that you basically \u201close\u201d a year, which is what a gap year would be for some. This messed me up because I do have goals and now I was a year behind. Of course I\u2019m still gonna reach my goals (to an extent), but it\u2019s not gonna be what I originally wanted (for example finishing med school at a certain age, etc.)", "OP spoke a half truth the need to apply to multiple schools through an assumed truth because they will need to. They could have found a way to approach it from a different angle to have gotten their same point across such as looking at a state school that specializes in the sisters interest so instead of it being a safety school it is equally appealing but not as unobtainable. Tact does matter", "Sure, she should have back ups. But she has been told this repeatedly, and has not acted on it. She knows and is choosing to ignore advice because her mind is set. I'm not saying it's a great place, it's not, but she doesn't want alternatives or back ups. Who is to say she would even go to them if it came to it.\n\nI'm just saying she could get in, and if she doesn't than it's her mistake to make. It is not an excuse for OP to straight up squash her dreams, no matter how well intentioned.", "I see where you are coming from but I don\u2019t agree with you. Because I went to the top school in my country at 17 and graduated with my bachelors at 21 and was like well wtf now lol. Everyone\u2019s story is different. There\u2019s no guarantees how this will turn out for OPs sister. Gap years work out fine for many people. That being said I do agree that you\u2019re right that a backup plan never ever hurts and people should have one. But 17 year olds are also allowed to make mistakes and shouldn\u2019t have to decide every life decision as a teenager.", "You\u2019ve given your sister your best advice and she hasn\u2019t taken it. You aren\u2019t her parent. If it were me, I\u2019d let it go at this point. A gap year won\u2019t hurt her. Pushing her anymore won\u2019t likely change her mind and is likely to make the relationship between you two more strained. \n\nMy older sister died thls year after a Long life. She handled things in her life much differently than I did but what helped us have a good relationship was that we each only shared out opinions when the other person asked for it.  So many people don\u2019t have good relationships with adult siblings and they regret it. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d drop the subject and tell her you have confidence that she will make the right decision for her. (And if it doesn\u2019t work out for her, don\u2019t rub her nose in it.", "NTA. I also dreamed of going to Brown - but I applied to other schools as well because I knew Brown had a low acceptance rate. As it happens, I was NOT accepted - so if it was the only school I'd applied to, I would have been forced into a gap year and might never have gone to college. You might have been a little harsh with how you phrased it, but your sister does need to be realistic.", "NTA, hope for the best but plan for the worst.\n\nWe just went through this. My oldest has their primary pick, but we still applied to 14 others. Got accepted to all the secondaries with several merit based scholarships across them. We felt like our odds were good on our primary but it wasn't to be. They only accepted 11% of applications.\n\nAnyway, ever giving the second choices a good look over, the one they applied to almost as a joke, turned out to be a really good fit.", "5% admissions rate globally is not a universally distributed 5%. \n\nIf she\u2019s in a major US coastal city, it\u2019s like .25% or less. Brown can fill the entire freshman class with *qualified* candidates from just NYC. \n\nYou did her a favor.", "NTA   \nYou care. You told her know something she doesn't and you're just trying to warn her.  But, people just love to shoot the messenger, so now it's time to just say nothing and stay out of it.", "YTA. You're not wrong but it wasn't your business and clearly your delivery was more about how you're annoyed by her confidence  in her application, however misguided that may be, rather than helping her. World comes to worse she doesn't get in and spends a year living at home, working and applying to other unis. Not really a big deal.", "NTA you\u2019ve said your piece, don\u2019t harp on about it, go about your own business and let her get on with hers.  It\u2019s her life, her choice and if she gets in, then great if she doesn\u2019t, then she has been told.", "NTA. You\u2019d gone out of your way over and over to warn your sister that she\u2019s likely setting herself up for a huge disappointment - and the reality that she\u2019ll have no place at any college.\n\nYour parents have done her a huge disservice by encouraging her to focus purely on Brown without a backup plan. And AH for calling you a brat for doing what they should have been doing!", "NTA, but you have done enough. If shit hits the fan, your sister will learn the necessary lesson. Taking a gap year is not going to ruin her life. She\u2019s old enough to take responsibility for her choice.", "NTA you're being realistic. When I was applying for grad schools, I started off with only two of them. My best friend annoyed the piss out of me until I had applied to like 10. The one I was genuinely hoping for (a mid-tier school imo) and was already currently enrolled at, I got denied for. The one that I applied to just for the Hell of it (ivy league), I actually got into. Safety schools are really important because just because you look good on paper doesn't mean they are going to want you. That's just the reality of the admissions process.", "That\u2019s how both I and my best from college got our Harvard degrees. \n\nAlso, artofterm may be the best screen name ever. I wish I could steal it.", "I reckon he's tried the 2nd approach a lot and has tried to be nice but seeing her time and time again reject that notion has pushed him to be a bit harsher. Is it a bit mean? Yes. But since he is doing it for her own benefit and from a place of kindness I can't call him an AH", "To clarify: gap year as in a missing year in your CV, not gap year as in taking a year to travel, work or volunteer and gain experience", "I agree with your points about how it is harsh but realistic but I think that's what makes him NTA. He has tried the kind approach and it hasn't worked. He has had to resort to a meaner approach because he has run out of options.\n\nHe is ultimately coming from a place of love and kindness and trying to get her to see the light. I can't call him morally an AH for that", "I feel like this is underestimating how bad it would be to have an unplanned gap year though. That kind of thing can really throw a wrench in your long-term plans if you were previously someone with good enough grades and overall profile to even be considering the Ivy League. It wouldn\u2019t just be a moment of disappointment, now she\u2019d have to deal with a whole year of taking community college classes that might not transfer well, or working whatever job she can find. And her chances of admission the following year might not be as good.", "What a bad take. \n\nHe isn't saying this to crush her dreams.

A gap year wouldn\u2019t affect someone in the UK/Australia/NZ that much but it would in the USA.  Their work culture is completely different", "Yup it\u2019s one thing to have a well-planned gap year like Malia Obama did but the kind of gap year you have at the last minute because you didn\u2019t get into college isn\u2019t going to be great. Maybe you could do a last minute switch to enrolling at the local community college (though who knows how well those credits will transfer) or find a retail or food service job just so you\u2019re not sitting around the whole time.
