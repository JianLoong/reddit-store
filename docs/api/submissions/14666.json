Realistically you\u2019re probably right. It is extremely hard to get into ivy leagues these days and she would need a very impressive application to get in.

I think unfortunately sometimes being honest makes you an asshole even if the person should hear it.\n\nGoing forward I would advise letting it go. Maybe apologize and tell her you\u2019re trying to be realistic and want her to have a backup plan just in case things don\u2019t work out.

Is she out of her mind? \u201cYou probably won\u2019t get into Brown\u201d is a perfectly reasonable and realistic statement to make to pretty much anyone who doesn\u2019t have an Olympic gold medal and a Nobel Prize. Trying to get her to apply to matches and safeties along with her reaches isn\u2019t being bratty or putting down her dreams, it\u2019s being realistic.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the girl a year behind me in high school who said Wesleyan was her safety school. She didn\u2019t get in *anywhere.*    \n\\*Brown and NYU is a slightly odd combo. Lots of people who really like Brown also really like Wesleyan and vice versa. Wesleyan is smaller and not urban, but the feel of the schools is very similar. She might want to look at it.  But she still needs matches and safeties.", "NTA. She really needs to apply to multiple colleges. You probably could have been nicer, but it's more caring to look out for her in a slightly rude way than let her get rejected later with no backup plan because you didn't want to say anything mean.", "I agree! It's fine to apply only to her dream schools if she's okay with waiting a year and needing to apply to different schools if she doesn't get in.

Gap year can make getting back into school hard. \n\nSure, she may get in but she also may not. \n\nShould have the OP been nice? Probably. Should the parents, teachers, and any \"authority\" figure been the one to say before the OP? Yes. Life isn't nice and setting yourself up for success by having backup plans is smart. \n\nI talked about being an aerospace engineer for years. I still made sure to have backups.

So they need to wrap her in cotton wool her whole life in case her feelings get hurt? Better her own family tell her now and push her to make better preparations than for her to end up with the rejection letter with no back up plan at all coz then she is really going to have something to be upset over.

If you have solid goals a gap year will most likely mess your goals up for you (I\u2019m not saying it will mess it up entirely, but it will to some extent). For example, I\u2019m in med school, and the 1st year we need to have 80% of the ECTS. I had some personal issues and all, which led to me not being consistent with studying and sadly not reaching the 80%, which meant I had to reach that 80% the next year, and only then would I be able to participate in exams of the second year. This means that you basically \u201close\u201d a year, which is what a gap year would be for some. This messed me up because I do have goals and now I was a year behind. Of course I\u2019m still gonna reach my goals (to an extent), but it\u2019s not gonna be what I originally wanted (for example finishing med school at a certain age, etc.)", "OP spoke a half truth the need to apply to multiple schools through an assumed truth because they will need to. They could have found a way to approach it from a different angle to have gotten their same point across such as looking at a state school that specializes in the sisters interest so instead of it being a safety school it is equally appealing but not as unobtainable. Tact does matter", "Sure, she should have back ups. But she has been told this repeatedly, and has not acted on it. She knows and is choosing to ignore advice because her mind is set. I'm not saying it's a great place, it's not, but she doesn't want alternatives or back ups. Who is to say she would even go to them if it came to it.\n\nI'm just saying she could get in, and if she doesn't than it's her mistake to make. It is not an excuse for OP to straight up squash her dreams, no matter how well intentioned.", "I see where you are coming from but I don\u2019t agree with you. Because I went to the top school in my country at 17 and graduated with my bachelors at 21 and was like well wtf now lol. Everyone\u2019s story is different. There\u2019s no guarantees how this will turn out for OPs sister. Gap years work out fine for many people. That being said I do agree that you\u2019re right that a backup plan never ever hurts and people should have one. But 17 year olds are also allowed to make mistakes and shouldn\u2019t have to decide every life decision as a teenager.", "You\u2019ve given your sister your best advice and she hasn\u2019t taken it. You aren\u2019t her parent. If it were me, I\u2019d let it go at this point. A gap year won\u2019t hurt her. Pushing her anymore won\u2019t likely change her mind and is likely to make the relationship between you two more strained. \n\nMy older sister died thls year after a Long life. She handled things in her life much differently than I did but what helped us have a good relationship was that we each only shared out opinions when the other person asked for it.  So many people don\u2019t have good relationships with adult siblings and they regret it. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d drop the subject and tell her you have confidence that she will make the right decision for her.

They have one specific school in mind, and now they are just in limbo for an entire year.", "NTA", "NTA - Brown University only accepts 6.6% of those that apply.  She would have to have awesome grades, test scores, extracurricular activities, community service, references, and a stunning resume/letter.  NYU is at 16.2%, needed about the same application.  It does not hurt to have a few backups. If she were to take a gap year, she would have to do something kick @$$ to get them to take notice on her second try (they know it is the second try). Your parents need to understand that just because she is their little baby girl the rest of the world could car less.  Sounds like she is the golden child.", "Ehhh, it was mean but at least she's hearing the rejection from your mouth rather than a letter from the school. Hopefully she'll prepare now. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you gave your sister a reality check and it bounced.", "Info: Is affordability an issue?  It was a big deal in our family with 3 boys who went to college.  Edit:  NTA. You have to apply to a ton of places.", "NTA. I was a straight A student with a 31 on the ACT, the president of several clubs in my high school, National Merit, and Honor Society. I was rejected from Brown.", "NTA\n\nshoot for the stars but have a safety net for the fall\n\nA good plan always includes the possibility of failure and redirection", "I agree with you.  MY son, straight A's- 4.0. - slaughtered the SAT & didn't get into his 1st pick, so we scrambled & got him into another colleges.", "Nta. - sub 6% admit rate means that valedictorians and perfect score SATs are being rejected. Also NYU is an okay choice if your family is loaded but otherwise lets look up a lot more options. Because even if she can get in, its going to cost a lot of dollahs.", "I had perfect grades, high SATs, a good interview, a laundry list of extracurriculars, played several instruments, lead several clubs, and science competitions where I took first place, and I wasn\u2019t accepted to brown (my 1st choice). You were harsh but not incorrect", "YTA if you don't drop it now.  She's heard what you've had to say and nothing you say is going to bring her back to earth on this.", "My sister did this. She wouldn't listen to anyone at the school who tried to persuade her to apply for state schools with huge scholarship opportunities. She was certain she'd get into MIT so she memorized the Boston metro line and had mapped out where she wanted to live/eat/study. \n\nShe had the whole family on board and everyone was eating up her hype. I quietly sat back, hoping she'd get in to avoid the drama but I knew she'd get at least waitlisted. She had the whole family gather on 03/14 (the day they release their admissions results) only to see a big, fat \"REJECTED\" on her computer screen. Her \"safety\" schools were Dartmouth and Princeton. Both also rejected her. \n\nShe ended up going to the local state school on the most minimal \"honors\" scholarship I've ever seen because she applied so late after the scholarship deadlines. She ended up not qualifying for better scholarships the next few years she was there. She still seethes and swears someone was out to get her and ruined her applications almost 10 years later.", "Can you explain how op is respectful", "I said it a bit aggressively since I got annoyed, but I just said \"you're probably not going to get into brown, you need safeties otherwise you won't make it into any universities\" something along those lines", "A teen without a realistic college plan is a teen who may not be ready for college at all. Shiny spines needed for sure! NTA.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be a gap year. She can go to community college and get some prereqs out of the way for cheap.", "Smart. And with a good attitude of planning like that I bet you will be successful wherever you end up.", "Yes best to just give up and not even try. She can work at like Amazon or something", "This is good advice. My mom used to say, \u201cI\u2019ll say this once and then I\u2019ll shut up about this \u201c to let me know she strongly disagreed with a choice of mine but wasn\u2019t going to interfere with me making my own decisions. It was great because 1) I tended to consider her opinion more because I felt respected and 2) she never created a situation where she was nagging at me.", "Why would op want a relationship with her", "I replied to someone else's comment, but it was along the lines of \"you probably wont get into brown, u need to apply to other universities or you won't get into any\"", "It's a bit of both. She wants to go into computer science maybe but it's still a bit undecided. She does love the idea of brown and its campus though mostly", "Then, softly, YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to warn your sibling about wanting safeties. That (applying to safety schools) is the smart move anyway. However, the way you did it wasn\u2019t kind. Did she need a jarring moment? Maybe. Sometimes that is the only way to get through to someone, but idk if that\u2019s the case with your sis.\n\nIt may have been *what* she needed to hear, but your message may have gotten lost in the delivery. If you were annoyed then it likely came out even worse than you meant. \n\nI do think she\u2019ll get over it, but I would recommend being honest- that you\u2019re worried that her focus on Brown will hurt her in the end. You needed her to hear you so you went a little hard, but you care about her and want her to be happy in the long run.", "Why are you so annoyed though? If her not taking your advice frustrates you why don't you just take a step back and stop being so involved?", "agreed. i always wanted to do clinical psychology, but decided to take a gap year (s-actually took 3) because my mental health was so bad i didn\u2019t think i could manage university at the time. my siblings and classmates told me that if you take a gap year you\u2019ll never go back to school and end up working a min wage job your whole life. they were shocked when i did in fact go back. gap years work just fine, as long as you\u2019re secure in your goals and simply readjust your plans instead of dropping them", "They didn't tell her, \"Give up before you even try.\" They just told her to apply to some safety schools. So if she doesn't get into Brown, she still has options besides working at amazon.", ">it's no longer \"for her own benefit\".

It's not the gap year that's doing anything.", "No he called her to stupid to get into\nBrown why she be able to get into other schools", "Which is why I\u2019ve also stated in one of my comments that if people choose to take a gap year, that\u2019s their choice. In fact I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t feel that way anymore and realized that it was valuable to you. I was just sharing my experience, which was basically me actually losing a year.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m glad that you can at least see where I am coming from when I say that I feel behind now. Of course that\u2019s not the case for you anymore and I\u2019m happy to hear that. It\u2019s just that people are acting here like feeling that way isn\u2019t valid because it\u2019s not a big deal according to THEM. However it was a pretty big thing for me, feeling behind, having Indian parents who made me feel like a failure because of the year I lost, etc etc.", "The costs of med school being what they are, that actually seems like a pretty significant problem", "I could not agree with this more. Also, there's so much pressure on kids to develop this extensive resume before they ever graduate from high school. When we were first looking at college counselors (the HS in our district doesn't offer that service), one of the people we talked to suggested my son should do a peer-reviewed paper with a research lab at one of the larger, more well-known local universities. He's 16t! I was accepted for my PhD back in the 90s and wasn't expected to do that kind of work until I was actually in a doctorate program! (FWIW, I didn't go into that particular field)\n\nBy the time kids leave high school now they've focused so much on scores and grades they have little time to think about what actually interests them, and are fed a load of BS that if they don't do well now, they'll wind up in a flophouse. Sure, screwing around might have negative consequences, but I've yet to find a situation as an adult (barring dangerous ones) where I didn't get at least one do-over, even if the mistakae was preventable and surmountable.", "A lot of gap years don't start as a planned gap year. People often go 'what now?' And figure it out along the way. Your thinking is a contributing factor why so many people are needlessly stressed."]}
