So I (27M) have been married to my wife Chloe (28F) for 4 years and we have a 2 year old. Overall we have an awesome relationship, we are really best friends and I trust her with everything.\n\nI am estranged from my family which includes my older sisters Margaret (31F) and Molly (29F). Basically about 7 years ago my sister married to Brandon. Me and Brandon became pretty good friends but 4 years ago my sister cheated on him with her now husband. I was shocked to see how my family flipped on him. We were on vacations with this guy one week and the next week he\u2019s an asshole and was a bad match for my sister. It was appalling how my parents backed her and tried to cover it up whenever it was brought up. \n\nWhen my sister got engaged again I was living states away. I was invited to participate and I said I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t supporting a sham marriage and didn\u2019t feel like dropping hundreds of dollars traveling or taking time off work. I told my parents this and they exploded. I told them if they wanted to pay for my ticket to come in the day of then sure, but they refused. I said they would pay for another wedding but not a plane ticket? They got upset and I didn\u2019t show. I was then not invited to Christmas that year as they said it was too much drama because my sisters and I were not speaking. \n\nI got married 3 years ago. Brandon was a groomsman and my family exploded when they found out. They said it was disrespectful that I gave my oldest sister a solo invite when she was married. My parents said they wouldn\u2019t help me out with the wedding. I told them to keep their money because they weren\u2019t getting invited then because it was my event and they got no say on the guest list. I\u2019ve not spoken to them since. I got invited back to Christmas this year but I think that\u2019s just because I have a kid now. \n\nWhen I met Chloe I told her this dynamic and warned her that I would not be having family support. She was incredibly supportive. Well the last few months she\u2019s been changing things up. Our son was baptized and she asked if I wanted to invite my parents. My sisters sent me an invite to an event and I threw it in the trash. She pulled it out and asked if I wanted to do. She also friended my sisters on social media and comments on their stuff. Multiple other instances but the one that set me off was when she asked to invite my parents over for thanksgiving this year. I exploded. I told her she knew what she signed up for. And it was wrong what she was doing. She said that her family is so close (she has a huge family, 4 siblings) that she feels like I\u2019m missing something. I snapped and said my family isn\u2019t her family. My family is her and our kid. End of discussion and that I was leaving. Went golfing and cooled off. She\u2019s texted me a few times half ass apologizing. But she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. I told her to keep playing these games and see where it gets her.

It's straightforward and easy to understand, you are not in contact with your parents or siblings. Yeah you shouldn't have snapped but this wasn't the first instance of her pushing your boundaries. We all have a limit on how many times we can nicely say no. Which is what I don't think other commenters understand. \n\nI'd sit down with her and have a frank conversation about her disrespecting and ignoring you on this issue.", "NTA You're absolutely right to be angry at her about her meddling. She was horrendously wrong for attempting to insert herself into a strained/nonexistent relationship. You might want to consider if you really want to be in a relationship with someone who is untrustworthy and manipulative. \n\nIf you want to illustrate just what she did to you, ask her how she would feel if you started talking to one of her exes explicitly to get them to make amends. You can use her exact argument. Say you have \"a great relationship with your exes and she is clearly missing something by not having formerly intimate friends.\"", "NTA. It's a huge violation that she's gone behind your back to collude with family members you're NC with. That's unsettling and it's not her place. I'm sorry she's done this. It can be infuriating when the people closest to us invalidate us by wanting to forgive people on our behalf. You guys need to talk and get to the bottom of why she's doing this. Is she feeling unsupported with child rearing, and desperately searching around for more relatives to help ease the load? Is she genuinely unable to imagine that family members might be better off without each other because of her own great family? That's a failure on her part to be empathetic. Whatever it is, it's not acceptable for her to meddle in your relationship with your family that she was aware of before she married you. It's not like she had time to build her own separate friendships with them before shit went down- these are people she doesn't know, and she's connecting with them just to enforce her idea of a happy family onto you.", "Nta. Id be worried if she secretly bring your child near them.", "NTA she's disrespecting established boundaries. If she wants a relationship with them by all means but by repeatedly trying to put you in contact with people you don't want to be in contact with she's blatantly ignoring how you feel about the situation.", "IDK man. She's wrong for reaching out to your family like that. But you seem incredibly angry and resentful and controlling. \"I told her to keep playing these games and see where it gets her.\"  She's not your enemy, she's your wife, and she wants to have an extended family, which is a normal thing to want.

I didn't think so based on how this was written, buuut, alot of people on these reddit subs advise therapy and I think you or you and your wife would qualify for that.  Especially the way you basically threatened divorce.  I also can't help but think if I had read this from her perspective I might be on her side.  So, you're entitled to your feelings, but maybe not such a volatile reaction to her.  And she needs a better understanding of how traumatic these relationships are for you.  So I think therapy would be the answer.", "Lots of explosions in this family.", "ESH - She definitely should not have contacted your family, but you reaction was way over the line.

She\u2019s being mature. People change over time and  maybe give some forgiveness. Also you probably don\u2019t know all details. She may have been 100% in the wrong but maybe you\u2019re missing something if your family all turned on him.  You have been willing to throw away an entire family because of your sister cheating?", "Is this really a hill you want to die on? You sound very angry, is cheating really the only thing going on or was there more?", "ESH, your wife shouldn't have pushed the issue further after you explained why you didn't want to go to events and such. Not everyone has a close relationship with their family and that's okay. However, I don't think you should have exploded at her. Often times things do get annoying when you repetively have to explain yourself but expressing that you really didn't want anything to do with your family could have been done in a conversation opposed to blowing up.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour sister cheated on Brandon, not you. Her 2nd marriage wasn't a \"sham\" because the first one failed in that way. If you had simply declined to attend the wedding without the judgment/lecture, then you'd be in the clear.  Everyone becoming estranged over this kind of BS petty wedding nonsense is dumb, but all of you seem fine with it.\n\nYour wife is rightly concerned about being married to a person who would so cavalierly cut off his family. She apparently knows how a non-dysfunctional family behaves, and realizes she (and your kids) will be missing out on that.  But you're right, she knew what she signed up for.", "This seems like a case of FAFO on the wives part. I tend towards NTA, the wife was warned from the beginning.", "YTA - your extended family is also your child\u2019s family.  I\u2019m not sure why your family supported your sister in cheating on her ex-husband (maybe there are some things you don\u2019t know about the situation), but ultimately, it had nothing to do with you, and you depriving your child of knowing his grandparents and aunts, when they are willing and your wife is supportive of it, is really just shooting yourself in the foot long-term.  \n\nWhatever your grudge is with your sister, it is not worth you holding onto this long-term drama that negatively impacts your child and wife.  Maybe try some therapy?", "YTA. Are you really going let this ruin the family you build?  I get it that you do not like your parents and siblings. But your wife did not go behind your back and invite them. She has talked to you. What a crime!  Yes she is trying to influence you - that is her right as long as she is upfront about it. You are acting very unreasonable at this stage. If that is how you behaved with your parents/siblings it makes me question who is at fault for issues in those relationships", "Is she allowed to approach them without you? Would that be OK with you? Because I understand you've gone NC. But, I can see your wife wanting to get to know her child's extended family and have that child feel their love and support. So, would it be OK if she leaves you out of reconnecting?\n\nNAH. I can see both sides.", "YTA a bit. You over-reacted to your wife. She was acting in good faith, and wanted to mend the broken relationship. \n\nAlso your family is her family. That's what happens in marriage your should be seen as a son to her parents, and her as a daughter to your parents (if they are alive, and are on speaking terms).\n\nYour family is full of AH's, and your wife wanted to see if she could mend things. Maybe a bit too much. But maybe things can be mended?", "Ok, so unrelated to your wife, YTA with your family.\n\nMy best friend's husband cheated on her. She is still friendly with her ex-in laws (there's a kid).  But, she did not invite them to the new wedding.  Sure, Brandon was wronged, but you have zero affiliation to that guy.  You feigned some black and white moralistic reason for why your sister is pure evil & Brandon was pure wrong...\n\n... and yet, your sister married the other guy.  Maybe Brandon abused her. Maybe they had terrible sex.  You don't tell us why she prefers the other guy.  A whole family doesn't come to this conclusion \"the next week he\u2019s an asshole and was a bad match for my sister\" arbitrarily, especially as he is the \"wronged\" party.  While family loyalty typically remains with family, we all know when our friend or family member is the bad guy... so it sounds like there is something you don't know.\n\nAs for your wife, NAH, but you suck a bit.  She wants her child to have aunties and grandparents. Your estrangement makes no sense. They didn't abuse you.  You sided with one of their exes and pulled a bunch of stunts to punish your sister.  \n\nFull read, you come off as petty and extremely overreactive. Good luck to your wife and kid... if they decide to remain as your family.", "NTA, you've been open and honest with her, and she's trying to push you when it is your decision.", "NTA.\n\nNip it in the ass. She's probably quiet messaging your family side. Let it be known that for the respect of you and your relationship if this continues it's a complete breach of trust a whatever twisted logic you have to thinks it's acceptable it is not. Period", "NTA\u2026 she did not respect your very clear boundaries. Befriended your sister? You should be her priority, it\u2019s your back she should have \u2026 not your family\u2019s that she was well aware of from the beginning that you are estranged from\u2026 hope someone can pull the knife out of your back\u2026", "NTA. You're NC for a reason and she should respect that about your relationship with YOUR family, rather than trying to force happy families.", "NTA.\n\nThough I do believe your wife is acting out of extreme ignorance, more than as someone with malicious intentions. \n\nThat said, I agree with you. My father, who I am now no contact with, was extremely abusive. My husband had met him, often, because we were on speaking terms/low contact at the time. My husband is completely understanding about why I cut him off\u2014he was there for a bunch of the big moments that led me to going no contact. His family on the other hand? Can\u2019t fathom the idea of cutting off a parent. \u201cBut he\u2019s your father.\u201d Well, I was his child, but that didn\u2019t make him behave any better. I am absolutely certain that if given the chance to have met him before I went no contact, they would have found a way to keep him in my life once I decided to go no contact. \n\nSo, I understand your need to protect yourself. I definitely think you need to sit down with your wife and go over it all again\u2014not just the anger towards their actions, but the hurt. I hope that will get through to her.", "She is trying to help mend things.", "NTA. You have set very sensible boundaries with these toxic, abusive people. Your wife is dismissing them.

She shouldn't have gone out on her own and meddled but you're being unreasonable to think she wouldn't want more for your kid.", "The deal breaker is when you told her to keep playing these \"games\" and see what it gets her. One, that sounded like a threat that could be verbal, emotional or physical and two, it came across as controlling, angry and you come across as someone who needs to simply be alone. No spouse, no child in your life other than on a very limited basis. \n\nYour sister's relationship with her spouse was none of your business and you made it into an anger filled grudge. I suspect you only had her ex in your wedding to get back at your sister for some perceived slight. And guess what? Your wife doesn't need your permission to have the grandparents or aunts of your mutual child in her life.", "You could also push this to an extreme where your wife decides your controlling behavior isn\u2019t it, and she divorces you.  Then guess what, she\u2019ll be free to have whatever relationship she wants with your parents and sisters and can include your child in it; there is nothing here to indicate that courts would prevent this because your family hasn\u2019t done anything abusive or negligent.\n\nYour anger is corrosive.  If you don\u2019t learn to let things go, I do predict divorce in your future; if not over this, it will be something else, because your type of anger is almost never self-contained to one issue.  How sad.", "Well on your 2nd marriage make sure to warn her too.  That an event that didn\u2019t even involve you has destroyed not only your relationship with your family but your first marriage. \n\nYour child deserves a relationship with his entire family.  Your pettiness and anger will effect him eventually.", " Clearly not that happy considering that you blew up at your wife in a manner that was borderline abusive. I don't think that the therapy has been working considering how much you're flying off the handle AT YOUR OWN WIFE over her reaching out to her in-laws on her own. You almost sound like you're trying to control her, and that's not okay.\n\nIf you were truly at a place where you weren't angry anymore, you wouldn't have reacted like that. Hopefully you seek additional therapy or perhaps a different therapist altogether. In the meantime, is there any compromise that could be had? Such as your wife can be in contact with them with the understanding that you yourself are not going to be involved in it.", "Yet you are willing to divorce your wife over this??  Will your 2nd wedding be a sham?  Or will hers be?", "You are heading in the same direction. Are you going to call your second marriage a sham as well?", "> 4 years ago my sister cheated on him with her now husband.\n\nAlso, I did point out it's weird that OP never gave more insight than this -\n\n>the next week he\u2019s an asshole and was a bad match for my sister. It was appalling how my parents backed her and tried to cover it up whenever it was brought up.\n\nTechnically, \"cheating\", but more leaving Brandon for a new guy b/c the marriage wasn't working.  The sister wasn't having affairs and playing Brandon for a fool.  Their marriage didn't work and the sister moved along with what she - and rest of family agree - is the right person.\n\nOP is so  judgmentally moralistic and not representing the sister's story whatsoever, but there's no reasons WHY the sister's marriage didn't work with Brandon, WHY his whole family decided he's an asshole, etc etc.   It's a super petty estrangement b/c OP has an opinion about his sister's ex, of which he only seems to have a small piece (or sharing a small piece) of a likely big story.", "I think you assuming a lot here, especially in second paragraph. *The ex was in his wedding party to get back at sister?* Makes no sense.  He said he is working on his anger issues (he's got a way to go).", "I agree with this, Op, your anger is going to cause you so much harm.  Your wife sounds like a really sweet woman, and she does not deserve to be threatened by you.  YTA here for not calming down and understanding her perspective also. and for threatening her.  She had good intentions.", "Why? I don\u2019t get the children deserving relationships thing. Is that like in the constitution or something?", "OP admits they became \"pretty good friends.\" If it was just ex-BIL then yeah, but if you have a close interpersonal relationship with the person then the dynamic changes.\n\nFor example: my sister and her SO had a rough patch a while back. I was on my sister's side despite having strong suspicions that it was mostly my sister's fault. I'm not particularly close to my SIL so yeah, side with family. If we were close, though, I'd have more of an opinion. And if they suddenly started trashing my sister's ex, I'd have an issue with it. Especially if we were close enough to garner a wedding party slot.\n\nEdit: Should note that everyone remained civil during their separation like adults should behave so there wasn't really any hill to die on concerning sides.", "Yes, in my original reply... my best friend's ex cheated on her. She is still friendly with her ex-in laws. They agree she was the wronged person.  She did not invite them to her 2nd wedding.  They did not disown their son / her ex.  She still regularly talks to her ex-SIL, though.  You can be \"friends\" but that doesn't mean, by default, that he needs to pick Brandon's side.  (Also, Brandon was his friend thru this marriage, not his best friend since age 3).\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"siding\" with either.  People always know who is wrong, and 50/50 they think it's their friend/family who is an AH or the other person.  OP is the only person here who knows his sister both \"cheated\" (but also divorced Brandon/remarried the other guy) and his whole family thinks Brandon is an AH.   \n\nThat's too weird that all of them see it that way, and there's no details. Hence, Brandon likely did something, the divorce was slow-going or sister was hesitant to actually leave until she met Husband #2.  That's quite different than having affairs.\n\nEither way, he's giving Brandon a pass w/o knowing the full story, but either way, it's not a good enough reason for all this drama and an estrangement.", ">Also, Brandon was his friend thru this marriage, not his best friend since age 3).\n\nThis is completely irrelevant. Friends are friends.\n\n> it's not a good enough reason for all this drama and an estrangement.\n\nI agree that the drama is excessive. The parents throwing a temper tantrum about Brandon being in the wedding party to such an extent that they refuse to fund the wedding and cut him out of family events is making me wary of his family's moral compass. If there was something more, it's on them to share that info. Absent that, their behavior is inappropriate. You don't get to be pissed that someone keeps a friend if you don't explain why they deserve to be cut off.", ">The parents throwing a temper tantrum about Brandon being in the wedding party to such an extent that they refuse to fund the wedding and cut him out of family events is making me wary of his family's moral compass\n\nThe family claims Brandon was an asshole to this sister.  OP also didn't invite his actual BIL.\n\nWe don't know what Brandon did to the sister. He very well could have beaten her. Best case scenario, they were just incompatible.\n\nAnd I'm not agreeing that they can't be \"friends\", but putting this type of friendship above family is always going to be controversial. There's no evidence his sister is an evil person, and there's no evidence that it's worthy of total estrangement. (Clearly, his wife, who likely knows more of the story, also thinks OP is OTT and that's where we are now)."]}
