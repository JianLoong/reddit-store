So I (27M) have been married to my wife Chloe (28F) for 3 years and we have a 2 year old. Overall we have an awesome relationship, we are really best friends and I trust her with everything.\n\nI am estranged from my family which includes my older sisters Margaret (31F) and Molly (29F). Basically about 7 years ago my sister married to Brandon. Me and Brandon became pretty good friends but 4.5 years ago my sister cheated on him with her now husband. I was shocked to see how my family flipped on him. We were on vacations with this guy one week and the next week he\u2019s an asshole and was a bad match for my sister. It was appalling how my parents backed her and tried to cover it up whenever it was brought up. \n\nWhen my sister got engaged again I was living states away. I was invited to participate and I said I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t supporting a sham marriage and didn\u2019t feel like dropping hundreds of dollars traveling or taking time off work. I told my parents this and they exploded. I told them if they wanted to pay for my ticket to come in the day of then sure, but they refused. I said they would pay for another wedding but not a plane ticket? They got upset and I didn\u2019t show. I was then not invited to Christmas that year as they said it was too much drama because my sisters and I were not speaking. \n\nI got married 3 years ago. Brandon was a groomsman and my family exploded when they found out. They said it was disrespectful that I gave my oldest sister a solo invite when she was married. My parents said they wouldn\u2019t help me out with the wedding. I told them to keep their money because they weren\u2019t getting invited then because it was my event and they got no say on the guest list. I\u2019ve not spoken to them since. I got invited back to Christmas this year but I think that\u2019s just because I have a kid now. \n\nWhen I met Chloe I told her this dynamic and warned her that I would not be having family support. She was incredibly supportive. Well the last few months she\u2019s been changing things up. Our son was baptized and she asked if I wanted to invite my parents. My sisters sent me an invite to an event and I threw it in the trash. She pulled it out and asked if I wanted to do. She also friended my sisters on social media and comments on their stuff. Multiple other instances but the one that set me off was when she asked to invite my parents over for thanksgiving this year. I exploded. I told her she knew what she signed up for. And it was wrong what she was doing. She said that her family is so close (she has a huge family, 4 siblings) that she feels like I\u2019m missing something. I snapped and said my family isn\u2019t her family. My family is her and our kid. End of discussion and that I was leaving. Went golfing and cooled off. She\u2019s texted me a few times half ass apologizing. But she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. I told her to keep playing these games and see where it gets her.

It's straightforward and easy to understand, you are not in contact with your parents or siblings. Yeah you shouldn't have snapped but this wasn't the first instance of her pushing your boundaries. We all have a limit on how many times we can nicely say no. Which is what I don't think other commenters understand. \n\nI'd sit down with her and have a frank conversation about her disrespecting and ignoring you on this issue.", "NTA You're absolutely right to be angry at her about her meddling. She was horrendously wrong for attempting to insert herself into a strained/nonexistent relationship. You might want to consider if you really want to be in a relationship with someone who is untrustworthy and manipulative. \n\nIf you want to illustrate just what she did to you, ask her how she would feel if you started talking to one of her exes explicitly to get them to make amends. You can use her exact argument. Say you have \"a great relationship with your exes and she is clearly missing something by not having formerly intimate friends.\"", "NTA. It's a huge violation that she's gone behind your back to collude with family members you're NC with. That's unsettling and it's not her place. I'm sorry she's done this. It can be infuriating when the people closest to us invalidate us by wanting to forgive people on our behalf. You guys need to talk and get to the bottom of why she's doing this. Is she feeling unsupported with child rearing, and desperately searching around for more relatives to help ease the load? Is she genuinely unable to imagine that family members might be better off without each other because of her own great family? That's a failure on her part to be empathetic. Whatever it is, it's not acceptable for her to meddle in your relationship with your family that she was aware of before she married you. It's not like she had time to build her own separate friendships with them before shit went down- these are people she doesn't know, and she's connecting with them just to enforce her idea of a happy family onto you.", "Nta. Id be worried if she secretly bring your child near them.", "NTA she's disrespecting established boundaries.

I didn't think so based on how this was written, buuut, alot of people on these reddit subs advise therapy and I think you or you and your wife would qualify for that.  Especially the way you basically threatened divorce.  I also can't help but think if I had read this from her perspective I might be on her side.  So, you're entitled to your feelings, but maybe not such a volatile reaction to her.  And she needs a better understanding of how traumatic these relationships are for you.

She\u2019s being mature. People change over time and  maybe give some forgiveness. Also you probably don\u2019t know all details.

You have been willing to throw away an entire family because of your sister cheating?", "Is this really a hill you want to die on? You sound very angry, is cheating really the only thing going on or was there more?", "ESH, your wife shouldn't have pushed the issue further after you explained why you didn't want to go to events and such. Not everyone has a close relationship with their family and that's okay. However, I don't think you should have exploded at her. Often times things do get annoying when you repetively have to explain yourself but expressing that you really didn't want anything to do with your family could have been done in a conversation opposed to blowing up.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour sister cheated on Brandon, not you. Her 2nd marriage wasn't a \"sham\" because the first one failed in that way. If you had simply declined to attend the wedding without the judgment/lecture, then you'd be in the clear.  Everyone becoming estranged over this kind of BS petty wedding nonsense is dumb, but all of you seem fine with it.\n\nYour wife is rightly concerned about being married to a person who would so cavalierly cut off his family. She apparently knows how a non-dysfunctional family behaves, and realizes she (and your kids) will be missing out on that.

I tend towards NTA, the wife was warned from the beginning.", "YTA - your extended family is also your child\u2019s family.  I\u2019m not sure why your family supported your sister in cheating on her ex-husband (maybe there are some things you don\u2019t know about the situation), but ultimately, it had nothing to do with you, and you depriving your child of knowing his grandparents and aunts, when they are willing and your wife is supportive of it, is really just shooting yourself in the foot long-term.  \n\nWhatever your grudge is with your sister, it is not worth you holding onto this long-term drama that negatively impacts your child and wife.  Maybe try some therapy?", "YTA. Are you really going let this ruin the family you build?  I get it that you do not like your parents and siblings. But your wife did not go behind your back and invite them. She has talked to you. What a crime!  Yes she is trying to influence you - that is her right as long as she is upfront about it. You are acting very unreasonable at this stage. If that is how you behaved with your parents/siblings it makes me question who is at fault for issues in those relationships", "Is she allowed to approach them without you? Would that be OK with you? Because I understand you've gone NC. But, I can see your wife wanting to get to know her child's extended family and have that child feel their love and support. So, would it be OK if she leaves you out of reconnecting?\n\nNAH. I can see both sides.", "YTA a bit. You over-reacted to your wife. She was acting in good faith, and wanted to mend the broken relationship. \n\nAlso your family is her family. That's what happens in marriage your should be seen as a son to her parents, and her as a daughter to your parents (if they are alive, and are on speaking terms).\n\nYour family is full of AH's, and your wife wanted to see if she could mend things. Maybe a bit too much. But maybe things can be mended?", "Ok, so unrelated to your wife, YTA with your family.\n\nMy best friend's husband cheated on her. She is still friendly with her ex-in laws (there's a kid).  But, she did not invite them to the new wedding.  Sure, Brandon was wronged, but you have zero affiliation to that guy.  You feigned some black and white moralistic reason for why your sister is pure evil & Brandon was pure wrong...\n\n... and yet, your sister married the other guy.  Maybe Brandon abused her. Maybe they had terrible sex.  You don't tell us why she prefers the other guy.  A whole family doesn't come to this conclusion \"the next week he\u2019s an asshole and was a bad match for my sister\" arbitrarily, especially as he is the \"wronged\" party.  While family loyalty typically remains with family, we all know when our friend or family member is the bad guy... so it sounds like there is something you don't know.\n\nAs for your wife, NAH, but you suck a bit.  She wants her child to have aunties and grandparents. Your estrangement makes no sense. They didn't abuse you.  You sided with one of their exes and pulled a bunch of stunts to punish your sister.  \n\nFull read, you come off as petty and extremely overreactive. Good luck to your wife and kid... if they decide to remain as your family.", "NTA, you've been open and honest with her, and she's trying to push you when it is your decision.", "NTA.\n\nNip it in the ass. She's probably quiet messaging your family side. Let it be known that for the respect of you and your relationship if this continues it's a complete breach of trust a whatever twisted logic you have to thinks it's acceptable it is not. Period", "NTA\u2026 she did not respect your very clear boundaries. Befriended your sister? You should be her priority, it\u2019s your back she should have \u2026 not your family\u2019s that she was well aware of from the beginning that you are estranged from\u2026 hope someone can pull the knife out of your back\u2026", "NTA. You're NC for a reason and she should respect that about your relationship with YOUR family, rather than trying to force happy families.", "NTA.\n\nThough I do believe your wife is acting out of extreme ignorance, more than as someone with malicious intentions. \n\nThat said, I agree with you. My father, who I am now no contact with, was extremely abusive. My husband had met him, often, because we were on speaking terms/low contact at the time. My husband is completely understanding about why I cut him off\u2014he was there for a bunch of the big moments that led me to going no contact. His family on the other hand? Can\u2019t fathom the idea of cutting off a parent. \u201cBut he\u2019s your father.\u201d Well, I was his child, but that didn\u2019t make him behave any better. I am absolutely certain that if given the chance to have met him before I went no contact, they would have found a way to keep him in my life once I decided to go no contact. \n\nSo, I understand your need to protect yourself. I definitely think you need to sit down with your wife and go over it all again\u2014not just the anger towards their actions, but the hurt. I hope that will get through to her.", "She is trying to help mend things.", "NTA. You have set very sensible boundaries with these toxic, abusive people. Your wife is dismissing them.

No spouse, no child in your life other than on a very limited basis. \n\nYour sister's relationship with her spouse was none of your business and you made it into an anger filled grudge. I suspect you only had her ex in your wedding to get back at your sister for some perceived slight. And guess what? Your wife doesn't need your permission to have the grandparents or aunts of your mutual child in her life.", "You could also push this to an extreme where your wife decides your controlling behavior isn\u2019t it, and she divorces you.  Then guess what, she\u2019ll be free to have whatever relationship she wants with your parents and sisters and can include your child in it; there is nothing here to indicate that courts would prevent this because your family hasn\u2019t done anything abusive or negligent.\n\nYour anger is corrosive.  If you don\u2019t learn to let things go, I do predict divorce in your future; if not over this, it will be something else, because your type of anger is almost never self-contained to one issue.

The sister wasn't having affairs and playing Brandon for a fool.  Their marriage didn't work and the sister moved along with what she - and rest of family agree - is the right person.\n\nOP is so  judgmentally moralistic and not representing the sister's story whatsoever, but there's no reasons WHY the sister's marriage didn't work with Brandon, WHY his whole family decided he's an asshole, etc etc.   It's a super petty estrangement b/c OP has an opinion about his sister's ex, of which he only seems to have a small piece (or sharing a small piece) of a likely big story.", "I think you assuming a lot here, especially in second paragraph. *The ex was in his wedding party to get back at sister?* Makes no sense.

I was on my sister's side despite having strong suspicions that it was mostly my sister's fault. I'm not particularly close to my SIL so yeah, side with family. If we were close, though, I'd have more of an opinion. And if they suddenly started trashing my sister's ex, I'd have an issue with it. Especially if we were close enough to garner a wedding party slot.\n\nEdit: Should note that everyone remained civil during their separation like adults should behave so there wasn't really any hill to die on concerning sides.", "Yes, in my original reply... my best friend's ex cheated on her. She is still friendly with her ex-in laws. They agree she was the wronged person.  She did not invite them to her 2nd wedding.  They did not disown their son / her ex.  She still regularly talks to her ex-SIL, though.  You can be \"friends\" but that doesn't mean, by default, that he needs to pick Brandon's side.  (Also, Brandon was his friend thru this marriage, not his best friend since age 3).\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"siding\" with either.  People always know who is wrong, and 50/50 they think it's their friend/family who is an AH or the other person.  OP is the only person here who knows his sister both \"cheated\" (but also divorced Brandon/remarried the other guy) and his whole family thinks Brandon is an AH.   \n\nThat's too weird that all of them see it that way, and there's no details. Hence, Brandon likely did something, the divorce was slow-going or sister was hesitant to actually leave until she met Husband #2.  That's quite different than having affairs.\n\nEither way, he's giving Brandon a pass w/o knowing the full story, but either way, it's not a good enough reason for all this drama and an estrangement.", ">Also, Brandon was his friend thru this marriage, not his best friend since age 3).\n\nThis is completely irrelevant. Friends are friends.\n\n> it's not a good enough reason for all this drama and an estrangement.\n\nI agree that the drama is excessive. The parents throwing a temper tantrum about Brandon being in the wedding party to such an extent that they refuse to fund the wedding and cut him out of family events is making me wary of his family's moral compass. If there was something more, it's on them to share that info. Absent that, their behavior is inappropriate. You don't get to be pissed that someone keeps a friend if you don't explain why they deserve to be cut off.", ">The parents throwing a temper tantrum about Brandon being in the wedding party to such an extent that they refuse to fund the wedding and cut him out of family events is making me wary of his family's moral compass\n\nThe family claims Brandon was an asshole to this sister.  OP also didn't invite his actual BIL.\n\nWe don't know what Brandon did to the sister. He very well could have beaten her. Best case scenario, they were just incompatible.\n\nAnd I'm not agreeing that they can't be \"friends\", but putting this type of friendship above family is always going to be controversial. There's no evidence his sister is an evil person, and there's no evidence that it's worthy of total estrangement.

However, it's really odd that the rest of the family supposedly went from fine with Brandon to thinking that him & the sister were a terrible match at a snap. Either something was going on with that marriage that OP doesn't know about, or OP does know and is leaving it out.\n\nAnd then for getting so angry at HIS OWN WIFE that he screamed at her and threatened divorce over her contacting his family, which also didn't even involve him, I feel even more like we're really missing some important details to this story.

Then, they fucked him over again by not paying for his wedding when they did his sister's, purely because he didn't invite her husband, which why would he when Brandon is a groomsman. To answer your question, they fucked him over twice.", "Wow. That is some impressive exaggeration.", "Which is why I said he needs to have a serious sit down conversation with her. So they can be in the same page. But he shouldn\u2019t dictate her relationship with them so long as it\u2019s not interfering with their own relationship. Like a threat of divorce at this point is OTT.", "If he doesn't like her interaction he can leave or ask her to not bring them around him but he can't tell her who she can interact with them may be his family but he does not control someone else's relationship with them. If that's the case then he shouldn't be mad at his sisters for cutting him off for not cutting her ex off after their marriage was over.", "I agree .. When they did not include him in Christmas for not going to the wedding they threw gas on the fire. The wife needs to stay out of it.", "Exactly, he didn't cut them off. They did.", "In and of itself, not supporting the sister's new marriage is kind of an asshole thing to do. OP wasn't \"in\" the marriage, and no one else can truly understand what went wrong. At the end of the day, just support the sister and move on with life.\n\nHowever, the family has NO room to complain about OP's choice for groomsmen. If that guy didn't have a problem with his ex and her new husband at the wedding (and I have no idea if this is the case), then the family should have acted like adults about it.\n\nEdit: Boy, did I end up on the wrong side of Reddit today. Wow.\n\nI get wanting to take the moral high ground and be pissed off at the sister. She screwed up big time. But at the end of the day, that is between the sister and her ex. OP was not in the middle of that relationship. And being friends with the ex doesn't mean the ex didn't play a part in the divorce. And it doesn't mean he was in any way at fault. Divorce happens between couples. And by cutting off his sister over the infidelity means that the sister had no other value to OP outside of her vows to her ex. And to me, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nI have no idea if the sister has any redeeming qualities. But OP has stated that his sister's infidelity is the reason for his negative feelings towards her. He didn't list any other reasons, and that's why I kind of think he's the asshole.\n\nAnd I'm not saying he should have joined the rest of the family in crucifying the ex. OP has every right to be best friends with the ex and include the ex in the wedding party. That's OP's business, and the rest of the family can suck-it if they have a problem with it.", "Absolutely not. I think cheating is a very big deal and I wouldn't forgive someone who cheated on me. But his sister's cheating isn't OP's injury to forgive. He doesn't know the ins and outs of the marriage, and even if he did, why should the child miss out on knowing its grandparents and cousins?", "You don\u2019t need to cut your daughter off because she cheated, but you can make it clear you don\u2019t agree with her actions without abandoning her. I don\u2019t get the impression OP expected the parents to abandon her, simply not blame the sister\u2019s innocent partner for the affair.", "No the real issue he had was the fact the family turned on the innocent victim the ex husband and defended and condoned the actions of the guilty the sister", "He had to watch one of his friends get stabbed in the back and further watch his family, including his trashbag of a sister, cheer about it. He's a part of this family, so it does have something to do with him.", "I would be disappointed too, and it would absolutely change how I see them as a person. But they\u2019re still my siblings I\u2019ve known for my entire life. Their life and other peoples lives aren\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be defined by something people did years ago. What the sister did was shitty, and I wonder if they had a bad relationship prior to the cheating. But it\u2019s also OTT for op to cut out his parents because of his sister. What parents would abandon their child because they cheated? It\u2019s not fair of OP to expect that", "A good friend of his got seriously hurt and betrayed. That's not nothing to do with him.", "My parents tried your method until my grandfather almost hit my sister for sitting on his lap. \n\nI don't wonder.\n\nETA: Also, when you edit your post, it is courtesy to add \"ETA\" because originally, you had \"E S H.\"", "Nope! Not a chance I would ever let my kids anywhere near my NC family. And NO ONE else gets to decide that for the person that is NC with their family. This is a pretty toxic and ignorant take.", "So ur ok with being verbally abusive to someone because they asked a question wow. \ud83e\udd23 so glad I have a partner who would never and I'd never regardless of how mad we are. If u as an adult can't control ur anger toward the person u love u don't need to be with them. Also, this is telling of how he treated his family when they stood by his sister instead of embracing her ex.", "Which is true...she definitely should have respected his boundaries but talking to her how he did isn't acceptable regardless of how mad u may be and telling another grown person who they can interact with is controlling", "The road to hell is paved with good intentions. She married a person who clearly indicated before they got serious in the relationship that they wouldn't have anything to do with his family and she happily agreed. She can change her mind now but the consequences are on her hands not the op's.", "The wife is the controlling one!\n\nShe\u2019s doing what she wants without regard for OP\u2019s feelings about his family.\n\nThat\u2019s not \u201cgood intentions.\u201d", "He said he's finished with therapy, done the work and is happy where he is.", "It's not. It's a warped view of \"family\". I'm NC with one of my parents. My kids are old enough now that I've had to talk with them about it a little bit. They'll see a picture of me, as a kid, and ask who the adult holding me or next to me is. I tell them it's my parent, and that I don't see them anymore without getting into all the reasons why. The don't miss something they never had to begin with. I know someday they'll have more questions, and I'll be open and honest about it. The truth is, my parent doesn't deserve a relationship with them, not the other way around. Why would I let my abuser have access to my kids? That's wild to even consider.", "Because the children are innocent in all this.  They shouldn\u2019t be barred from forming relationships with others based on past grievances.  They should know grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.", "I can get being petty to an extent as long as it's just affecting him but it's hard to square him being petty in the most recent part of this family squabble and simultaneously believe he's right to keep his wife from attempting to bridge some form of contact again. Should his wife be reaching out to them directly without him? Probably not, but like... the vibes I'm getting are that he needs (better) therapy and to de-emphasize this grudge and not to basically categorize anybody who associates with his family as an enemy for the rest of time.", "The cheating doesn\u2019t involve him!  It wasn\u2019t his relationship.  If it was his cheating spouse sure.  \n\nKeep downvoting me but she was wrong but he chose the nuclear option.  Like he is again contemplating by threatening divorce.", "Nobody asked him to cut the dude off, but yes, their reaction to him including Brandon in his wedding was unfair, but cut off worthy? I just don\u2019t see it that way.", "His reaction was judgmental.", "I mean, can you not see how her befriending people who are estranged to him wouldn't directly affect their marriage? I mean, it seems a little silly to pretend that those two things aren't connected. And he's not dictating, he's stating his boundaries. She's more than free to make these friendships but doing so might mean that he leaves. Because that's what you do when your partner repeatedly ignores or sidesteps boundaries. And I agree with the conversation aspect. That's what needs to happen rather than her trying to play the mediator.", ">If he doesn't like her interaction he can leave \n\n>I told her to keep playing these games and see where it gets her\n\nDid you bother reading the whole thing?\n\nHe obviously can't prevent her from making a relationship. But he told her what will happen if she tries and now the ball is in her court.", "He said he became good friends with Brandon, Brandon was even a groomsman at his wedding.", "I disagree. I feel its okay to follow ones morals in this case. Just because someone is family doesn't automatically mean they get a free pass.", "He watched as his friend was stabbed in the back and everyone in his family, including his trashbag of a sister, cheer about it. I wouldn't support my sibling if they did this either. Why does he have to support a cheater? Just because they came out of the same vagina?", ">Edit: Boy, did I end up on the wrong side of Reddit today. Wow.\n\nReddit gets crazy when it comes to cheating.", "Because OP feels his family are disrespectful and not good role models?  They refused to assist with his wedding although they paid for two for the cheating sister?  Because they ostracized him from holidays? He doesn't want them in his life and having them in his son's life would require them to be in his.  All of these are his decisions to make, not his wife's.", "But that still doesn't have anything to do with him. His parent's were probably just trying to save face. The simple fact is that they love their daughter more than they loved her husband so it's easy for them to place the blame on him. It's not right but is it worth cutting your whole family off and divorcing your wife over?", "I\u2019m going to assume there\u2019s more history than what he gave, but it\u2019s *his* family. I think it would be massively presumptuous for his wife to assume she knows better than he does regarding them. It seems likely to me that there\u2019s a long history of his parents excusing his sister\u2019s shitty behavior. And he can probably do no right. \n\nIf there isn\u2019t more history, he likely overreacted somewhat, but it\u2019s still his family to manage and if he doesn\u2019t want a relationship with them, that\u2019s entirely his call.", "Did you miss the part where OP was uninvited for Christmas. They would rather defend their daughters affair than keep their family together. Ego can be extremely toxic.", "It\u2019s seems like the family never reckoned with the wrong that was done, though, which is what OP seems to have an issue with. God knows my parents love me unconditionally but they wouldn\u2019t pretend I\u2019d done nothing wrong & pay for a second wedding after I\u2019d cheated\u2026", "Right! What about nieces and nephews and others who may have little to nothing to do with it? Also they may know more about the story with Brandon that the OP does.", "His friend would have gotten hurt and betrayed even if she had divorced him before remarrying. OP probably would have probably blamed her for that too. She doesn't owe it to her brother to stay with someone she is unhappy with.", "She didn't just ask a question. She has repeatedly disrespected him. She has repeatedly stomped all over his boundaries. She deserves an ultimatum because he has repeatedly told her no calm, and she didn't give a single fuck about him or his feelings. She even went as far as to befriend them against his wishes. She can fuck right off. He's been way too nice up to this point.", "Hes controlling for having boundaries about contacting HIS narcissistic family wow. That way if OP wife were to talk with a past abusive ex OP had, he would be controlling if he told her not to interact with her? You do realize how asinine this sounds right?", "Does his post, and do his comments, ring of happiness to you? Because most people (regardless of how they're voting) seem to be seeing a lot of anger.", "Why? Can\u2019t they form relationships with people who don\u2019t hate their dad?", "That\u2019s entire dependent on the reason for being LC.", "They. Cut. Him. Off.", "Because it was a shitty thing for her to do?? I mean, if you don't want people to judge you maybe don't be a cheater lol.", "I read it and if he doesn't like it leave....he made the threat stand on it. That alimony and support gonna hurt.", "There is a difference between following your own morals and blanketing them on others so you can be judgy and feel superior. I'm just stuck on the fact that he wrote his family off for drama that he was not involved in.", "And they\u2019re the ones who shut him out of family events bc of his feelings toward his sister having an affair. Y\u2019all seem to be reading OP as if he would\u2019ve never forgiven his sister or parents when it seems no one even tried to ask for or earn it", "What is this? \n\nWhy are we caring about something that doesn't exist? \n\nYou don't always miss what you don't know, and the child has all the relatives on the moms side.", "Again...its still controlling if he told another grown human not to interact with anyone. She has to make the choice who she interacts with. This does not void her of consequences for those actions which is what u seem to think. We are done cuz I'm not gonna change my view and at this point the convo is useless. Have a great day", "He has anger because his wife is an asshole that is being toxic AF and violating hus boundaries repeatedly.", "He seems very angry and bitter to me, but *he* says he's finished with therapy, done the work and is happy where he is. He's not going to get more counselling if he thinks he's fine.", "They \u201chate\u201d their dad because of his actions.  I\u2019m moving on from this debate.  \n\nDon\u2019t punish a child for their parents actions.  Especially when the inrush event **didn\u2019t involve them**.", "No. They\u2019re sending him invitations that he is throwing away. That isn\u2019t cutting him off.", "People make mistakes. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s on her 4th marriage for the same reason. We don\u2019t know her life. We don\u2019t know her ex husband, and even so, you want to cut out an entire family because one sibling cheated on the husband and everybody isn\u2019t ostracizing her? This is insane.", "He said he wouldn't go to the wedding, then they wrote him off by not inviting him to christmas. All that's happening now is he isn't responding to their invites, which is his right to do.", "His family wrote him off.", "Nah - when you cheat on someone you put them at risk for STIs, you betray them and emotionally and mentally harm that person. People who do that are showing you their priorities and their values and you\u2019re absolutely within your right to not want anything to do with them. I wouldn\u2019t be friends with someone who was physically abusing their spouse, I wouldn\u2019t be friends with someone who was cheating on their spouse either. If you want to use someone and hurt someone that\u2019s your prerogative but I will absolutely judge you for it and limit my involvement in your life and you in mine. OP has done nothing wrong, his family were the ones who did wrong by writing him off for not attending the wedding.", "Wait, why do they need earn his forgiveness?", "Why should OP's sister have to ask him for forgiveness? He's not the one cheated on. He doesn't get to control her love life just because he is friends with her husband. Her punishment for cheating is getting divorced. OP doesn't know every detail of her marriage and for all we know she could be happier with her new husband.", "And he might have been fine and at peace until his wife decided to no longer respect his boundaries. I'm NC with one of my parents. Here, right now, I'm perfectly at peace and happy with my life including that part. If I found out my wife was suddenly in contact with that parent, despite repeatedly telling them I'm not ok with this, I'd suddenly not be happy anymore. Doesn't mean I'd need to go back to therapy. It's ok to be mad when someone's disrespecting you and ignoring established boundaries.", "Why OP has to let his kids in contact with low morale, toxic people? Like who irl want their children to be in contact with people they found repulsive? Even their repulsiveness wasn\u2019t directed at OP, OP has a right to cut off bad influences. A lot of people irl once know someone is a cheater, they will just gradually distance themselves from said person. Even said person didn\u2019t cheat on them. No one wants that kind of behavior in their social circle.", "Ok.."]}
