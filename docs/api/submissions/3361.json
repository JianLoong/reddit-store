My guess is that she thought it was a double-barreled gotcha: if I didn\u2019t say anything, I was ignorant trailer trash and if I did say anything, I would be zeroed out of my Father\u2019s life (a goal of her\u2019s). I kept my mouth shut not because of the afore, I kept my mouth shut because *she* looked the fool. Many years later, I still think it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nI understand why you\u2019d request that (NTA) but there\u2019s something very satisfying about letting people expose themselves for who they are. If your future MIL does wear white, she\u2019s going to get major side eye and judgement from your guests.", "NTA. If she's done it before, she will definitely do it again, especially if she has animosity towards you. If she refuses to show you the dress and buys something that attempts to outshine you can ask your best friend or someone to keep an eye on her on conviniently \"accidentally\" spill some red wine on her so she will be forced to change. Maybe I'm TA?", "NTA but I do wonder what's going through MIL's head. Having experienced so much crap from her own MIL I'd have thought she'd want to do better, not pay it forward.\n\nI'm not sure you can expect power of veto over her attire for the wedding (and I doubt you'll be in a position to police it anyway given everything else going on that day) so I think you need to hope you can trust FIL and maybe you and your fiance have an agreement in place for what to do going forward if she does try to upstage you.", "NTA. She won't comply, though. I'd elope if I were in that position. I think you have to decide that she's off her rocker & just laugh at her when she does crazy stuff. She's trying to make you angry & hurt - don't give her the satisfaction. Decide not to let it get under your skin. I know it's impossible to let it go 100%, but you can expect it & mentally deal with it beforehand so it doesn't make you upset at the wedding.", "Info - can we get all these entitled and insecure women a dictionary so they can maybe someday understand what the word *respect* means.\n\nRespect is a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements.\n\nPrint that out, frame it, hang it somewhere she will see it.", "NTA. That\u2019s a valid concern seeing her history. If there\u2019s someone that needs to grow up it\u2019s ur MIL. She needs to understand that this is your wedding and she either behaves and dresses appropriately or she\u2019s not invited.

But what do you care? \nLet her come in  a wedding dress. She'll make a fool of herself, especially when you just ignore her dress and kill her with kindness. \nBreak the circle!", "NTA\n\nIt's really common for mother-ofs to show the bride their dress choice for approval. Also if she's done it before she will do it again.... given how upset she got I have a feeling she was already planning something.", "NTA - if she is like this and hates you, then whatever dress she chooses is just the tip of the iceberg. If I were you, I\u2019d turn down FIL\u2019s offer of paying to take them completely out of the equation, even if you don\u2019t have the money to do what you want.", "NTA. It is your wedding. She can comply or f*** off.", "Soft YTA. I don\u2019t honestly know why you care what she wears to your wedding, especially if they are paying for it.

Other people will judge her for wearing something crazy if she does, you don\u2019t need to do anything yourself except look like the grown up you can be and shrug it off.", "YTA (or YTBridezilla). If she's identifying this as the worst thing anyone has ever done, and she cares at all about being viewed as \"the bad guy,\" she won't pull anything. The worst that happens is that she shows up in white and makes an ass of herself. Just leave and let her dig her own grave/further alienate her son.", "YTA.\n\nShe sounds awful, truly.  But you also don't get to say you want to \"approve\" what she wears to your wedding.   \n\nI'm a guy, and I truly think some people are a bit too concerned about people \"showing up\" the bride anyway.  But still, if she wants to wear something super fancy to her son's wedding, that is her choice.  FIL assured you she wouldn't wear white.  But anything else, sorry, that is bridezilla territory \n\nI now welcome my downvotes because I know this sub thinks that a woman making any outlandish demands she wants for her wedding is fine.", "INFO: Are you doing this to all of your wedding guests?

You\u2019re taking your FiLs money for the wedding. Then you turn around and try to make demands of his wife. NO. You don\u2019t get to do that, he\u2019s paying so HE makes the rules. You don\u2019t like it? Give the money back, find it yourself. But you don\u2019t seem like you\u2019ll do that, so sit down, shut up.", "YTA you don't need to approve her dress", "YTA for worrying about this so much. Tell her you find it unacceptable to wear white and leave it at that. If she's out to screw you over, she'll just show you a different dress than one she's going to wear, so you have better things to focus on. Tell your fiance you both need to stand up to her if she does it anyway.", "YTA. As long as she doesn\u2019t wear white, you have no authority to approve her dress before she purchases it.", "YTA. As long as she isnt wearing white you have no entitlement to command her dress.", "YTA. Unless your MIL is planning to come in a G-string with tassels on her nipples, or butt naked, I\u2019d focus on having a wonderful wedding and not worrying about what she wears. Years ago, I had a dispute with one of my bridesmaids (my SIL) over her not wanting to wear the dyed to match shoes I asked them to wear and we had hard feelings about it for years. Now I realize that other than me, nobody would have even noticed her footwear and the dispute created years of problems with someone I would be interacting with on numerous family occasions. Having a fight with your MIL by demanding to approve her dress is a recipe for discord with the family you are marrying into. If she wears something unsuitable it would reflect poorly on her, not you, and chances are most people wouldn\u2019t even remember what she wears.\n\nEdit: added a missing word", "NTA. MIL has already shown herself untrustworthy previously, and sounds like she intends to cause a spectacle on your wedding day.\n\nEither she can abide by the rules, or stay home.
