She needs to promise not to wear a *bridal colour* on pain of being mortally embarrassed by you telling everyone what an AH she is if she turns up in one of the colours on the day. Which you've probably guaranteed by bringing it up, but it needed to be said.", "You have no guarantee she\u2019ll wear what you approve regardless, so this demand is ridiculous. NTA but not strategic. Do something TOTALLY different and you won\u2019t have to worry about her out finessing you. Wear black. Be dramatic AF. And stop worrying about what she wears. GMIL was smart enough to ignore her, sounds like. Do the same. She only has as much power over your wedding as you give her.", "I'm on the fence about this one. There's a FIL and not a SFIL (and the Troll *always* uses a stepfather-in-law).", "I just want you to know that your hashtag made me smile.", "I've heard this type of story in my own family (Eastern European). Every generation bequeaths the hate they experienced onto the next generation. And every generation suffers, but no one manages to break the cycle. You were forced to serve, so now you demand others to serve you. Generations of family relationships filled with deliberate nastiness, misery and obligation.\n\nIt sucks. But this is what you're signing up for. Be aware that this is the established family dynamic. If you manage to break the cycle, there will be definite costs to you and your husband's relationship with his family. Just be sure that you BOTH know this going in.", "I could be \\*way\\* off base here because I am from a different culture ... but isn't it a bit hypocritical to first try to undermine your MIL's wedding (disrespecting her elders), then turn around and cry about how you need to \"respect your elders\" when your future daughter in law worries that you might do the same to her?", "I would recommend slipping in a literary allusion: \"Don't worry, dear. NO ONE thinks that you look like Miss Havisham! Don't be silly - you look LOVELY!\"", "That would be a perfect response. I almost hope she gets to use it!"]}
