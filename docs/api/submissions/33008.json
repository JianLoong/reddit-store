Take him aside and explain that, while it's nice and sweet and wonderful that he thinks his big sister is beautiful, that it's also nice to compliment people on other things they're good at besides looks. Also take the time to take your husband and older daughter aside and explain to them that the 17 yo needs to be complimented on her accomplishments just as much if not more than her appearance, and that just because she's uncomfortable with the excessive compliments, they shouldn't completely stop because that can also create a complex.

It\u2019s our job as parents to make sure we don\u2019t raise superficial a-holes and that we raise well adjusted future adults that don\u2019t base their entire personality off their looks. So go to your 6 year old and explain to him that you weren\u2019t mad and that he was sweet for complimenting his sister, explain how his sister is more than a pretty face, list all those wonderful things about her and why she needs to hear them, and then give him a list of all the wonderful things about him-plus tell him he\u2019s handsome because with all those compliments to big sister he may feel like an ugly duckling.", "NTA \n\nTalk to your son (and maybe the rest of the family tbh) about how the best compliments are about things someone chooses for themselves or has some measure of control over. \n\nFor example, is she a hard worker? Is she great at styling her hair or outfits? Does she tell funny jokes or stories? Does she bake the best cookies? Does she get good grades? \n\nShe didn\u2019t choose her face or body. Her family should be the people who actually see her for her, not just her pleasantly arranged features.", "You are NTA, if your son is a six year old and he is being repetitive, saying the same things over and over again, of course it can be annoying for the older sister to keep hearing it not just from him, but from everyone including strangers.", "NTA because you handle it nicely.

As someone who grew up hearing how \"beautiful\" i was and having all of my other kickass achievements and personality traits go unnoticed lol. My mom has literally said \"but you're the pretty one\".  Keep talking to her about those things. I won awards for writing, was an all state athlete, and could play 3 different instruments in band. I even made it through the all state band tryouts and got to go to Japan.", "NTA but he is six, maybe you need to talk to your husband and start demonstrating more appropriate compliments, sit down with your son and see if you can build a list of all the great things about big sis, and big sis can make a list of all the great things about little bro with a rule that only one can relate to physical appearance (things like kind, funny, loyal etc). \n\nDon\u2019t just tell him, show him.", "No I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA.

The thing is, if you say the same thing over and over it seems like you don't really know that person very well. You have to find new and unique things about them to compliment.\n\nAlso NTA, yes you could have found some better wording but your intentions were good and I don't think you did any real harm.

You could have focused on the repeating rather than the words themselves, a compliment is nice, but repeating it over and over is annoying, and makes it seem like that's all the person being complimented is. Your daughter is already having to cope with the repeated compliments on her looks, and would clearly prefer compliments on things she thinks matters instead, such as intelligence or hard work or something, a talent she has. \n\nI think you handled this alright, though. Your son is young, and is probably partially copying what he sees other people do. He likely thinks that your daughter likes these compliments, as well, since she gets them all the time, and sees it as his way of telling his big sister how much he loves her. But repeating like this would be annoying even if it was a new or rare compliment like 'you're such an amazing singer' or something. You're teaching your son that once is enough with compliments, as well as trying to teach him that looks aren't the most important thing. Now you need to show him other things that can be complimented, get your daughter involved as a practice dummy, point out things she's good at or should be praised for doing, so he learns what sorts of things make good compliments and how to word them.", "NAH (at least between you and your six year old)\n\nI think you should have been more to the point about being like \"you can't just repeat stuff a million times,\" since that's easier for a kid to understand than the concept that calling someone pretty might be annoying. But that's not an issue.\n\nI would talk to other members of your family about the fact that she's tired of it.", "NAH\n\nI appreciate you considering your daughter here, but you may wish to look outward to all the people modeling this to your six year old.\n\nHe loves his sister and sees everyone else showing their affection for her by praising her beauty.", "Confusing.", "NTA.  I think you handled it well by saying he can say it once and move on--resolves the nagging while allowing the complient.  I will be honest though, the lead up to that made me feel like you were jealous of your daughter's good looks but the way you handled it was perfectly fine.", "Unless beautiful is her nickname it is kind of weird to call one person beautiful and not everyone else.", "ESH except for your daughter and 6 year old (though I'm sure he's well on his way with the way you and husband are raising your kids). Talk about superficial. \n\nYou all should never raised your kids in an environment where your daughter's looks are the main focus and are so commented on and talked about *by her own family*. I hope she knows to value herself for more than just her physical appearance, and good luck to her if/when her looks fade.", "I feel for your daughter. I've always had the opposite issue. People would bend over backwards to tell me how intelligent and accomplished I am, until \"big brain\" was the only compliment I ever got. And all I wanted was for someone to tell me I'm beautiful. It sucks to be reduced to only one of your qualities. Nevermind that I don't feel anywhere near as intelligent as people praise me to be.\n\nBut I would suggest going for everyone else instead of the 6 year old. Yes, he was annoying, but he doesn't know any better, just wants to be nice, and probably imitates everyone else's behaviour. Sit down your husband and the sister first.", "NTA but you should of addressed this to the dad and older siblings instead of the youngest one. He's only copying what others are doing. I get he was probably saying it over and over in a span of a few minutes (and that alone gets super annoying) but he probably still didn't get it. He won't understand until the others he is copying also changes their behavior.", "Yes, there\u2019s a much better way to handle it. First of all your son is six years old and he\u2019s not doing anything wrong so, to tell him he can\u2019t say that anymore confuses him and is unnecessary. at six years old he\u2019s probably old enough to understand the dynamic and you can explain to him that his sister gets complimented a lot for her looks and it\u2019s fine to say she\u2019s beautiful, but she would also like to hear other kinds of compliments not just that she\u2019s pretty because being pretty as something you\u2019re born with, so you can\u2019t really take a lot of credit for it.\nYou should tell your daughter that like many things in life there are two sides to the coin, and she will benefit greatly from being pretty because doors will open for her that will remain closed for other people, and it might not be fair, but she is going to be given a privilege that other people don\u2019t get. She should be grateful and gracious in accepting the compliments which it sounds like she is. She should also not let the fact that she\u2019s always been complimented on her looks discourage her other accomplishments. If she has a strong sense of self-worth, she will not, let the fact that she\u2019s pretty become her defining trait. Especially people that have not met her will only see the beauty because that\u2019s normal. Tell her not to become frustrated or annoyed, because that would be a sign of gratitude toward whatever Power gave her those looks. Lest they be taken away do not be scornful of your gifts. Don\u2019t try to control other people say because that\u2019s not practical nor is it necessary. The main adjustment needs to be made by your daughter, to graciously accept that she\u2019s beautiful and have an inner strength that defines herself not on her beauty, but on her other traits. But her beauty is part of her, so let it be encompassed within her sense if self. People are not telling her. That\u2019s the only important thing about her just because it\u2019s the only thing they remark on. That is the superficial external that is the most noticeable in the beginning. Tell her that she has a responsibility to make. Her beauty shine as bright as her beauty.", "NAH but maybe start by modeling the behavior you want to see in your family. Instead of telling your youngest not to give her those compliments or how to give them, when he says she\u2019s beautiful maybe say \u201cyes she is AND an incredible XYZ\u201d to highlight her other achievements and talents. Maybe talk to your husband about how your daughter is feeling so he can start modeling that behavior as well.", "NTA - But kids just do what they see everyone else doing. That's why he says it over and over (because he hears it over and over). \n\nIt sounds like both your daughter and your son need to hear you (everyone, but you can only control you) giving her encouragement, admiring her character, complimenting her talents and her intelligence. People think they are making someone feel good when they call them pretty or beautiful. But it is really reductive and reinforces the idea that women's place in the world is to serve as decoration. And if you're not pretty, well... what are you good for?\n\nAnd for your son, I'd hope he learns to see women as much more than pretty or not pretty. \n\nYou sound like a good mom by the way.", "Nta. You probably could've explained a little better to the 6 year old but I get it. Sometimes my 5 year old does the same thing and \"you only have to say it once\" is the best I can do at the time cause I'm in the middle of something. Try and explain a little better when you have time to sit and maybe even bring her in so she can explain?", "NTA and I cannot tell you how happy it has made me to age out of all that attention for being thought beautiful.  It was HORRIBLE.  Seriously.  People are going to slap me down for that, and go right ahead.  But try to hear me, too.  I'm all about my brain and work ethic, and being \"attractive\" meant that brain and all my hard work hardly ever got seen when I was out among people and if it did, it was only after I fought through all the sexist static and female jealousy sniping to be seen and heard -- when I'd never say a mean word about another girl or woman ever.  I'll fight off anybody harassing or bullying anybody of any age, shape, or appearance, because being harassed or bullied at any time for any reason is awful.  Seriously, I'm vicious against bullies of anybody -- I leave scars when they go after anyone in my vicinity, so I'm no freakin' victim here.  I just have say that's it's a brutal truth that your daughter gets an extra dose of that static, harassment, and female violence as a female that people think \"pretty.\"  She can't just be invisible.  It's why I went into a field of work where I'm judged by what I write and what people read, and why I have lived most of my life out of the public view to escape all the pushing and grabbing and the venom. You did exactly the right thing, and please keep telling others to knock it off, too.", "I'm going to say NTA. Constantly repeating the same thing over and over is a common thing little kids do, but it is something parents need to gently teach them is annoying to others. Also, he's old enough to have a conversation about how even if it's a compliment, constantly referring to someone else's appearance is also annoying and can make them feel self conscious about themselves, or that their physical appearance is more important to others than other attributes.\n\nEditing because after reading these comments, I think a lot of people here are missing the point and also maybe not experienced with small children: the bad behavior here was less about what he was saying and more about the repetition. This \"repeating the same phrase over and over in a short time span\" thing is pretty common in small kids, but it is also SUPER annoying. It's something you need to gently teach kids not to do, which is what OP was doing. Yes, she needs to also talk to the other people who comment on her daughter's appearance all the time, but in the moment she needed to correct her son who was actively being annoying to his sister. It's a phase, but like many annoying habits if you don't tell the kid when they are being annoying nicely, someone else will inform them later in a mean way, or else just avoid them altogether and then they wonder why no one wants to be friends.", "You\u2019re TAH for addressing the 6 yr old out of every body .

You started at the wrong end of the age spectrum. The adults and older ones need to start treating her as more than aesthetically pleasning.

You're trying to teach your son to respect women and to value them for more than just their looks. In a way, you're also teaching him not to sexualize women and turn them into sexual objects. You're teaching him how to treat women the right way. Keep this up. I say this as a mom to a 1.5 year old boy.", "NTA its important for her to find confidence in other aspects than looks esp what if she gets a skin disease and her looks get tarnished or she gets hair loss, happens to women more often than not.  I mean just look at some of the beauty subs on reddit women in their early twenties are crying that they arent as beautiful as they were at 17 bc THats the life of women and their skin. You do not want a daughter obsessed with her looks", "NTA if your goal was to teach your son to look beyond the beauty to what\u2019s inside her as well. It\u2019s important to raise your son not to be superficial. \n\nThe way you\u2019ve worded things is very careful, though, and I just caution you to take a deeper look inside yourself and make sure you aren\u2019t jealous, of her looks, that your son doesn\u2019t compliment you, of the attention she gets.  Just sit with this awhile and if you think that may be true move forward differently", "I think since this is her preference - to be regarded for more than her looks - then N T A for asking. I'm not wild on implying the 6-year-old, who sounds like an incredibly sweet, loving kid who adores his older sister, is therefore TA though!

Something that he really didn't make happen; it's just part of who he is - but the only thing people ever mention about him.\n\nI think that could help him stand in his sister's shoes better. He sounds empathetic, so I think he would get it. I'm sure your daughter would appreciate at least one more person getting it and seeing her beyond just her looks.", "Perhaps the better way to phrase it would be, \u201cyes, sister is beautiful, but do you know she is so smart & really good at whatever?\u201d  I think redirection is the best approach to this.", "Does she showcase her other talents for them to shine past her beauty? If not you can\u2019t be mad at your top stand out quality if the other qualities don\u2019t measure up. Use the beauty to get the attention then show what you are really good at\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Your a little bit the AH just because of the fact that he\u2019s 6 years old and he just got told of for complimenting his sister. What a sweet boy, most 6 year olds call their sisters ugly. Tell her dad to start complimenting her about other things and you do the same more and hopefully he will catch on and copy that.", "Nope. I think when we compliment others it needs to be on something beside appearance.  \u201c I love your laugh\u201d. \u201c I love how happy you get\u201d. \u201c I love the way you make others smile\u201d. Etc. my mom did an amazing job in complimenting things besides the way I look. It was awesome for my self worth", "NTA. It sounds like you tried to explain the situation to your son in a child-appropriate way. \n\n\u201cNext time try telling her that she\u2019s smart or kind. She might like hearing that too.\u201d", "Yta u sound jealous", "kids that young mimic everything they see because they're trying to adjust and be normal people. \n\nHe sees everyone, including his father, using this behavior, so he is trying to fit in.\n\nYou've been a Mom for a while. I'm pretty confused as to how you don't understand that.", "You will have to be there for her more than you think. There is a fine line between pretty privilege and pretty burden. She is crossing into that scary side. Not all Guys will accept gracefully to be turn down. And some girls will hate her just by her looks. Some coworkers or peers will pin her accomplishments to her pretty face. And of course the creeps!!\nLife is not fair to all but women are always the one paying the biggest bills on the unfairness", "50/50 tbh. could be the asshole but then again could also not be the asshole", "Ahh. Your poor daughter. She wants to be recognized for her skills and abilities. Not everyone aspires to be simply \"beautiful\". You son, on the other hand, doesn't really understand that overly \"complimenting\" isn't really a compliment. You need to help him realize how to be a great young man, but it will take time. It's a difficult line you walk. I don't have any great advice, but I will say NTA.", "YTA. You sound like you're jealous of your daughter", "Hmm, your kiddo learned this compliment from somewhere. You and her dad need to look at how you treat her and what you compliment. Don't put this on a 6 yo", "NTA", "You\u2019re gonna say it to the 6 yo but not anyone else? Not even the weirdos in public? But the 6yo lol", "I mean, kinda unrelated answer, but the reason people are always complimenting your daughter and why it\u2019s tiring for her is because it\u2019s this constant reminder that when you\u2019re a girl, \u201cprettiness\u201d is your social and cultural currency. It\u2019s very sad and tiring", "Soft YTA - Instead of telling a kid not to do something, maybe prompt them to compliment their sister on something else. \"Hey buddy, that's sweet of you! What ELSE do you like about your sister?\".", "NTA He is six, he should understand", "NTA.  You were nice about it, but I agree with the suggestions of explaining in a way he can understand. \n\nSide note: if you don\u2019t mind sharing, I wonder where your daughter\u2019s sentiment that her skills be preferred over her looks comes from.", "NTA. He's six. You're allowed to tell him to stop being annoying. But your daughter's father and family need to stop remarking on her looks. I don't know if you can talk to her dad about it, but  you aren't doing anything wrong. You are trying to be a good parent to your daughter.", "I don\u2019t get complimented on my skills or looks. I\u2019m fucking invisible. Tell her it could be worse.", "NAH\n\nIt's odd to me that a post just above this was notable for saying that a 6yo and an 8yo should understand when they are calling someone something they didn't want to be called. \n\nA 6 year old should also know when something is uncomfortable for someone else. This might be a little tricky, because it's saying something nice, but that it makes your daughter uncomfortable if that's all people say to her. Good on her. Perhaps she, herself, could talk to her younger brother and explain why even something nice to say can get uncomfortable.", "NTA.\n\nNot at all. That's setting a basic, reasonable boundary, which is pretty much 99% of good parenting. You're definitely in the clear here.", "Your son is a little kiddo\u2026 he\u2019s still learning, and that\u2019s how he says that he loves her. Let the little one off the hook, and tell the others to knock it off. It\u2019s a very common milestone for kids to repeat things, and your little boy is trying his best to share with his sister that he cares about her.\n\nYTA for picking the wrong person to tell off, but NTA for telling someone to stop making her uncomfortable\u2026 If that makes sense, haha! So I guess I\u2019m saying soft YTA.", "Ur just jealous atp", "It was addressed with the 6 year old because of the repetitiveness in one sitting.  It\u2019s good for him to learn to compliment others on more than one attribute, and also teach him that it is not ok to repetitively pester someone with compliments.", "I like the gentle parenting push but I would say NTA because he\u2019s going to grow up and it\u2019s important in future relationships to not be overbearing in compliments and learn to compliment other characteristics", "This is interesting.  When I was 4, I don\u2019t think I ever distinguished looks or noticed who was and wasn\u2019t beautiful.  I wonder if she picked up from your wife getting a lot of attention for her looks perhaps (gonna assume she does when you describe her a smoke show)?", "I don\u2019t wanna dismiss or anything but this feels like a bit of a self centered take :/", "Exactly lol", "I mean from this context, it doesn\u2019t seem like the attention her daughter got was sexual?", "This feels a bit selfish when this is said abt attractive people rather than about valuing all people, esp less attractive people, equally.  \n\nIt\u2019s like saying \u201cthis rich person with lots of family connections didn\u2019t choose that life\u201d instead of \u201cvalue all people of all backgrounds for what they can equally control.\u201d\n\nI hope I\u2019m not coming rude (not my intention)", "this 100% YTA", "How did you come to the conclusion of jealousy when it\u2019s stated that her sister and girls as much as guys give her a lot of positive attention?\n\nAgree with you on the first part though", ">One person's treasure is not someone else's loss.\n\nNow, so this is a thing that disappears as we get older, but can you really blame people for insecurities when society has a tendency to favor those that are attractive and ignore or even put down those that aren\u2019t attractive?  And for less attractive people to need to \u201cmake up\u201d for their looks with talent or work harder to get the positive attention attractive kids get.  Ofc depends on how shallow and status seeking the environment is.  \n\nHalo effect/physical attractiveness bias is real and well documented Yk?  Those that weren\u2019t considered attractive kind of need as much or even more empathy than the attractive kids yk.  I guess just my opinion from what I\u2019ve noticed.  It\u2019s probably notable that it\u2019s common for \u201cugly ducklings\u201d to talk abt how they\u2019ve experienced lot more positive attention and kindness from people when they grew into their looks.", "Is this just abt seeing more to an attractive person, or also valuing less attractive people/treating people of all appearances equally?", "I mean it\u2019s valid to want to be seen as more than just looks, or have boundaries for unwanted attention respected, but halo effect/attraction bias is real so can\u2019t really say attention on physical features (not talking sexual) isn\u2019t positive.  Especially can\u2019t deny that when it comes to people equal on skills or talents, the one with physical attributes has an advantage that came from something they were born with.", "I've got kids who are very smart (also good looking, I think, but I may be a tad biased).  I have always emphasised that being smart is not something they should be vain about.  They lucked out with their intelligence.  It's what they do with it that matters.  Our praise would usually centre around something like the effort they put into to studying etc.\n\nHaving a daughter, I have also been conscious of the whole body image thing.  So right from when she was little, I would talk about her beautiful heart, and kindness etc.  She knows she's pretty.  She knows that I think she's pretty (I didn't ignore it).  But I don't want her to value herself based purely on that.\n\nMaybe this is a tack you can take with your six year old?  Explain to him that yes, his sister is beautiful, but that isn't something she earned, and if he wants to compliment her, he should choose something that she actually did to achieve.  That will help him understand why you are telling him not to call her that all the time.  Use an example of something he has naturally compared to something he made an effort on to help him understand.", ">If other people in my life mostly complimented my appearance vs. other skills, it might make me kinda sad that they don't value me in a broader sense.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind answering, I kind of wonder where this sentiment comes from when it comes to people who are extremely attractive.  Is it a particular insecurity abt skills, or related to looks being used to invalidate skills for women (not sure your gender but I mention women because I\u2019ve heard this sentiment more from attractive women than from attractive men).  Does context affect this (ie work vs social settings)?  Is it a fear of not being liked when looks fade, or just this belief that looks invalidate anything else to offer?", "Not sure how this wasn\u2019t obvious to OP.  Like, figure it out", "I do this with my kids.  I don't say, \"go and put the washing out\".  I say, \"could you put the washing out for me, please?\"  It's not actually optional, they know they have to do it, unless they have a good reason they can give me, but it feels so much better for them to be 'asked'.\n\nAfterwards, I'll say, \"thanks for doing that for me\".\n\nI never have any arguments getting my kids to do things around the house, and I attribute much of it to asking nicely."]}
