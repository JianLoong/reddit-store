Take him aside and explain that, while it's nice and sweet and wonderful that he thinks his big sister is beautiful, that it's also nice to compliment people on other things they're good at besides looks. Also take the time to take your husband and older daughter aside and explain to them that the 17 yo needs to be complimented on her accomplishments just as much if not more than her appearance, and that just because she's uncomfortable with the excessive compliments, they shouldn't completely stop because that can also create a complex.

It\u2019s our job as parents to make sure we don\u2019t raise superficial a-holes and that we raise well adjusted future adults that don\u2019t base their entire personality off their looks. So go to your 6 year old and explain to him that you weren\u2019t mad and that he was sweet for complimenting his sister, explain how his sister is more than a pretty face, list all those wonderful things about her and why she needs to hear them, and then give him a list of all the wonderful things about him-plus tell him he\u2019s handsome because with all those compliments to big sister he may feel like an ugly duckling.", "NTA \n\nTalk to your son (and maybe the rest of the family tbh) about how the best compliments are about things someone chooses for themselves or has some measure of control over. \n\nFor example, is she a hard worker? Is she great at styling her hair or outfits? Does she tell funny jokes or stories? Does she bake the best cookies? Does she get good grades? \n\nShe didn\u2019t choose her face or body. Her family should be the people who actually see her for her, not just her pleasantly arranged features.", "You are NTA, if your son is a six year old and he is being repetitive, saying the same things over and over again, of course it can be annoying for the older sister to keep hearing it not just from him, but from everyone including strangers.", "NTA because you handle it nicely.

As someone who grew up hearing how \"beautiful\" i was and having all of my other kickass achievements and personality traits go unnoticed lol.

I even made it through the all state band tryouts and got to go to Japan.", "NTA but he is six, maybe you need to talk to your husband and start demonstrating more appropriate compliments, sit down with your son and see if you can build a list of all the great things about big sis, and big sis can make a list of all the great things about little bro with a rule that only one can relate to physical appearance (things like kind, funny, loyal etc). \n\nDon\u2019t just tell him, show him.", "No I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA.

The thing is, if you say the same thing over and over it seems like you don't really know that person very well. You have to find new and unique things about them to compliment.\n\nAlso NTA, yes you could have found some better wording but your intentions were good and I don't think you did any real harm.

You could have focused on the repeating rather than the words themselves, a compliment is nice, but repeating it over and over is annoying, and makes it seem like that's all the person being complimented is. Your daughter is already having to cope with the repeated compliments on her looks, and would clearly prefer compliments on things she thinks matters instead, such as intelligence or hard work or something, a talent she has. \n\nI think you handled this alright, though. Your son is young, and is probably partially copying what he sees other people do. He likely thinks that your daughter likes these compliments, as well, since she gets them all the time, and sees it as his way of telling his big sister how much he loves her. But repeating like this would be annoying even if it was a new or rare compliment like 'you're such an amazing singer' or something. You're teaching your son that once is enough with compliments, as well as trying to teach him that looks aren't the most important thing. Now you need to show him other things that can be complimented, get your daughter involved as a practice dummy, point out things she's good at or should be praised for doing, so he learns what sorts of things make good compliments and how to word them.", "NAH (at least between you and your six year old)\n\nI think you should have been more to the point about being like \"you can't just repeat stuff a million times,\" since that's easier for a kid to understand than the concept that calling someone pretty might be annoying. But that's not an issue.\n\nI would talk to other members of your family about the fact that she's tired of it.", "NAH\n\nI appreciate you considering your daughter here, but you may wish to look outward to all the people modeling this to your six year old.\n\nHe loves his sister and sees everyone else showing their affection for her by praising her beauty.", "Confusing.", "NTA.  I think you handled it well by saying he can say it once and move on--resolves the nagging while allowing the complient.  I will be honest though, the lead up to that made me feel like you were jealous of your daughter's good looks but the way you handled it was perfectly fine.", "Unless beautiful is her nickname it is kind of weird to call one person beautiful and not everyone else.", "ESH except for your daughter and 6 year old (though I'm sure he's well on his way with the way you and husband are raising your kids). Talk about superficial. \n\nYou all should never raised your kids in an environment where your daughter's looks are the main focus and are so commented on and talked about *by her own family*. I hope she knows to value herself for more than just her physical appearance, and good luck to her if/when her looks fade.", "I feel for your daughter. I've always had the opposite issue. People would bend over backwards to tell me how intelligent and accomplished I am, until \"big brain\" was the only compliment I ever got. And all I wanted was for someone to tell me I'm beautiful. It sucks to be reduced to only one of your qualities. Nevermind that I don't feel anywhere near as intelligent as people praise me to be.\n\nBut I would suggest going for everyone else instead of the 6 year old. Yes, he was annoying, but he doesn't know any better, just wants to be nice, and probably imitates everyone else's behaviour. Sit down your husband and the sister first.", "NTA but you should of addressed this to the dad and older siblings instead of the youngest one. He's only copying what others are doing. I get he was probably saying it over and over in a span of a few minutes (and that alone gets super annoying) but he probably still didn't get it. He won't understand until the others he is copying also changes their behavior.", "Yes, there\u2019s a much better way to handle it. First of all your son is six years old and he\u2019s not doing anything wrong so, to tell him he can\u2019t say that anymore confuses him and is unnecessary. at six years old he\u2019s probably old enough to understand the dynamic and you can explain to him that his sister gets complimented a lot for her looks and it\u2019s fine to say she\u2019s beautiful, but she would also like to hear other kinds of compliments not just that she\u2019s pretty because being pretty as something you\u2019re born with, so you can\u2019t really take a lot of credit for it.\nYou should tell your daughter that like many things in life there are two sides to the coin, and she will benefit greatly from being pretty because doors will open for her that will remain closed for other people, and it might not be fair, but she is going to be given a privilege that other people don\u2019t get. She should be grateful and gracious in accepting the compliments which it sounds like she is. She should also not let the fact that she\u2019s always been complimented on her looks discourage her other accomplishments. If she has a strong sense of self-worth, she will not, let the fact that she\u2019s pretty become her defining trait. Especially people that have not met her will only see the beauty because that\u2019s normal. Tell her not to become frustrated or annoyed, because that would be a sign of gratitude toward whatever Power gave her those looks. Lest they be taken away do not be scornful of your gifts. Don\u2019t try to control other people say because that\u2019s not practical nor is it necessary. The main adjustment needs to be made by your daughter, to graciously accept that she\u2019s beautiful and have an inner strength that defines herself not on her beauty, but on her other traits. But her beauty is part of her, so let it be encompassed within her sense if self. People are not telling her. That\u2019s the only important thing about her just because it\u2019s the only thing they remark on. That is the superficial external that is the most noticeable in the beginning. Tell her that she has a responsibility to make. Her beauty shine as bright as her beauty.", "NAH but maybe start by modeling the behavior you want to see in your family. Instead of telling your youngest not to give her those compliments or how to give them, when he says she\u2019s beautiful maybe say \u201cyes she is AND an incredible XYZ\u201d to highlight her other achievements and talents. Maybe talk to your husband about how your daughter is feeling so he can start modeling that behavior as well.", "NTA - But kids just do what they see everyone else doing. That's why he says it over and over (because he hears it over and over). \n\nIt sounds like both your daughter and your son need to hear you (everyone, but you can only control you) giving her encouragement, admiring her character, complimenting her talents and her intelligence. People think they are making someone feel good when they call them pretty or beautiful. But it is really reductive and reinforces the idea that women's place in the world is to serve as decoration. And if you're not pretty, well... what are you good for?\n\nAnd for your son, I'd hope he learns to see women as much more than pretty or not pretty. \n\nYou sound like a good mom by the way.", "Nta. You probably could've explained a little better to the 6 year old but I get it. Sometimes my 5 year old does the same thing and \"you only have to say it once\" is the best I can do at the time cause I'm in the middle of something. Try and explain a little better when you have time to sit and maybe even bring her in so she can explain?", "NTA and I cannot tell you how happy it has made me to age out of all that attention for being thought beautiful.  It was HORRIBLE.  Seriously.  People are going to slap me down for that, and go right ahead.  But try to hear me, too.  I'm all about my brain and work ethic, and being \"attractive\" meant that brain and all my hard work hardly ever got seen when I was out among people and if it did, it was only after I fought through all the sexist static and female jealousy sniping to be seen and heard -- when I'd never say a mean word about another girl or woman ever.  I'll fight off anybody harassing or bullying anybody of any age, shape, or appearance, because being harassed or bullied at any time for any reason is awful.  Seriously, I'm vicious against bullies of anybody -- I leave scars when they go after anyone in my vicinity, so I'm no freakin' victim here.  I just have say that's it's a brutal truth that your daughter gets an extra dose of that static, harassment, and female violence as a female that people think \"pretty.\"  She can't just be invisible.  It's why I went into a field of work where I'm judged by what I write and what people read, and why I have lived most of my life out of the public view to escape all the pushing and grabbing and the venom. You did exactly the right thing, and please keep telling others to knock it off, too.", "I'm going to say NTA. Constantly repeating the same thing over and over is a common thing little kids do, but it is something parents need to gently teach them is annoying to others. Also, he's old enough to have a conversation about how even if it's a compliment, constantly referring to someone else's appearance is also annoying and can make them feel self conscious about themselves, or that their physical appearance is more important to others than other attributes.\n\nEditing because after reading these comments, I think a lot of people here are missing the point and also maybe not experienced with small children: the bad behavior here was less about what he was saying and more about the repetition. This \"repeating the same phrase over and over in a short time span\" thing is pretty common in small kids, but it is also SUPER annoying. It's something you need to gently teach kids not to do, which is what OP was doing. Yes, she needs to also talk to the other people who comment on her daughter's appearance all the time, but in the moment she needed to correct her son who was actively being annoying to his sister. It's a phase, but like many annoying habits if you don't tell the kid when they are being annoying nicely, someone else will inform them later in a mean way, or else just avoid them altogether and then they wonder why no one wants to be friends.", "You\u2019re TAH for addressing the 6 yr old out of every body .

You started at the wrong end of the age spectrum. The adults and older ones need to start treating her as more than aesthetically pleasning.

You're trying to teach your son to respect women and to value them for more than just their looks. In a way, you're also teaching him not to sexualize women and turn them into sexual objects. You're teaching him how to treat women the right way. Keep this up. I say this as a mom to a 1.5 year old boy.", "NTA its important for her to find confidence in other aspects than looks esp what if she gets a skin disease and her looks get tarnished or she gets hair loss, happens to women more often than not.  I mean just look at some of the beauty subs on reddit women in their early twenties are crying that they arent as beautiful as they were at 17 bc THats the life of women and their skin.

It\u2019s important to raise your son not to be superficial. \n\nThe way you\u2019ve worded things is very careful, though, and I just caution you to take a deeper look inside yourself and make sure you aren\u2019t jealous, of her looks, that your son doesn\u2019t compliment you, of the attention she gets.  Just sit with this awhile and if you think that may be true move forward differently", "I think since this is her preference - to be regarded for more than her looks - then N T A for asking. I'm not wild on implying the 6-year-old, who sounds like an incredibly sweet, loving kid who adores his older sister, is therefore TA though! He sounds great, many congrats.\n\nA better way to handle this going forward could be for you and her dad to start modelling the kind of compliments and behaviour you'd like your son to emulate. Praise other things in front of him, so he can pick up that women - starting with his sisters - can be complimented for all our many great attributes.
