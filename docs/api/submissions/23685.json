Her sister, my aunt, asked to borrow it to wear for her own wedding years later and my mom agreed. The dress was later returned to my mom.\n\nWhen I was 16 or so I expressed that I thought the dress was pretty, and my mom asked me if I\u2019d like to wear it one day for my wedding. I said yes! A few years later my cousin Jia got engaged and asked my mom to cut pieces of the dress to add to her own. Since she had already promised it to me, my mom asked me first if I was okay with it. I said I wasn\u2019t, since I still wanted to wear the dress for my own wedding. My mom said okay, and I thought that was that.\n\nToday we were talking about taking my male cousin\u2019s fiance dress shopping, and I mentioned how I would miss out on doing that. Through that conversation my mom told me then that she\u2019d given the pieces of her dress to Jia after all, and forgotten to let me know. I was upset.\n\nFirst, she tried to tell me she thought I okayed it, until I reminded her of the actual conversation. She then said she thought I wouldnt really care that much and that I\u2019d understand Jia wanted to have a part of her mom\u2019s dress (remember, my aunt wore it too). Then she brought up how I\u2019m not even engaged yet (dating for 7 years), and she thought my taste for the dress would have changed by now. She said I could still use other pieces of the dress Jia left behind.\n\nI\u2019m still upset. This was something very important to me for the sentimental value the dress held. I wouldnt have minded if it was lent to my cousin in tact, but the fact that it\u2019s been cut up means I can never wear my mom\u2019s wedding dress the way she promised me. I know that ultimately though, she\u2019s allowed to do what she wants with it because its her dress. My aunt wore the dress too so it makes sense that Jia be offered to wear it. But cutting it up? Going back on the promise? Not telling me? \n\nI feel like I was wronged here by both my mom and my cousin Jia, but am I just being entitled?\n\n(Edited for clarity)", "created_utc": 1690920778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fne8p/aita_for_fighting_with_my_mom_after_my_cousin_cut/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is.

You can include your bridesmaids, if you have any, or your friends, or your future MIL.. but\u2026 maybe not your mom. \n\nYou *had* a wedding dress picked out and promised to you, and your mom went back on her promise. Ok, fine, it was your moms dress to do with as she wanted, (even if she did ask what you wanted to do with the cutting parts off thing), and then ignored your wish that the dress stay intact for you.\n\nSo you will have to go get a different dress.

It would take a long time before I spoke to her again.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you feel is fully justified. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much about the dress, though it\u2019s certainly a part, as it is about you mother\u2019s dismissal of how important it was to you\n\nWhile, yes, the dress still was hers to do with as she liked, she had made a very important promise to you. One she knew was a big deal evidenced by her asking you about Jia cutting things from it.\n\nShe broke that promise, at a time when she knew fully that you would be upset about it, and consciously didn\u2019t tell you.\n\nShe didn\u2019t even limit Jia\u2019s cut from making the dress unusable.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s little you can do but work through your emotions and hopefully let the worst of them go.", "Nta\nBy this point it was becoming almost a family heirloom and would have been a wonderful thing for the women in the family to share in. Until she let your cousin destroy it. So now it's something that your mum, cousin and aunt share as a special thing, but not you. You don't get the special family thing because your mum favoured your cousin ny letting her wreck it when you asked her not to. Really selfish and entitled of your cousin aswell.", "NTA\n\nYou say that ultimately your mother is allowed to do what she wants with the dress, and that\u2019s true.\n\nBut she a) asked you if you wanted it b) received a response that yes, you did want it and c) didn\u2019t tell you about her changed decision.\n\nYour mother broke her promise and seemingly feels no remorse for doing so. She\u2019s given you justifications, not apologies, and pretended she thought you knew (she knows very well she never told you - in fact, would have had to actively hide the knowledge your cousin\u2019s wedding dress included parts of her own).\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I hope you find an amazing dress when the time comes!", "NTA.  your mom went back on something she said, and she made excuses for why she did it - you aren't engaged, she assumed your taste would change.  my mom has done similar things and i know how it feels, i'm sorry.", "NTA. It's very hurtful that your mother asked you about giving away a piece of the dress but then ignored your answer and did it anyway.", "NTA strange that your mom seems to say she was confused about your \u2018no\u2019 and that\u2019s why she cut it up, not that it\u2019s her dress her choice kind of thing.  I mean, she presumably asked you when Jia asked when she was getting married,your mom asked, you said no, she must\u2019ve given her the pieces in a relatively short time after that with an impending wedding.  And she forgot you had just said no?", "NTA. Even if for no other reason than her asking if you would mind and then doing it anyway. It may have been her dress but she implied that it was given to you.", "NTA. Mom knows she's the AH. She did everything she could to gaslight you over the dress when you called her out. I'm not sure on Jia. She may have not got the correct story from Mom if Mom's gaslighting you over it. Talk to Jia.", "NTA. While I think it\u2019s not the end of the world (without being disrespectful, your mom is alive and having her attend your future wedding would be more important), your mom asked you specifically and didn\u2019t even talk to you again about it. That\u2019s not okay and I completely understand why you feel hurt and not taken seriously. The reasons why she did it don\u2019t really count as she promised it and didn\u2019t respect you or the promise. \n\nI personally would take the rest of your mom\u2019s dress with pictures to a tailor and ask if they could remake the dress with the parts you have. Is there maybe something left from her wedding the other ones didn\u2019t wear? Jewelry, hair stuff or something else you maybe really love and connect with her?", "Nta.. it already happened and your mother doesn't give a shit about you. Why waste energy on someone that does not value you?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell your mom: Since she broke her promise about the dress, you will cancel the promisse of inviting her to your wedding.

A promise thrown away is going to hurt.\n\nI don't know how close you are with your mom.  I think to start over, she needs to understand she essentially destroyed your wedding dress, and own up to it, and apologizes.

She offered you the dress, making it YOUR future dress. \nThe comment she made about you being able to use the pieces your cousin left behind.....I need to calm down. I would stop talking to my mother if she did that. When you get married, you should change the date you go dress shopping and don't tell your mother. When she brings it up, you can tell her that you forgot  to tell her. I would make sure your future mother-in-law goes dress shopping with you. Keep your mom out of ALL your wedding planning. (Sigh) What your mother did is no small thing , and your mom acting like it's no big deal worsens the situation. This is the kind of thing that breaks relationships. Don't accept any part of her wedding dress. Heck, don't accept anything from her (including money) for your wedding. When she buys things for your future kids, say, \"No thanks. Why don't you give that to my cousin Jia. I'm sure she'd love it.\" OMG, even that isn't enough to make my anger subside (kicks over chair). - NTA", "NTA. Your Mom offered you the dress, you accepted the dress. She asked if she could deconstruct it and you said no. She did it anyway and kept it from you.

That is pretty messed up.", "NTA I\u2019m mad reading this, because of how OP\u2019s mom forgot a whole conversation. It feels like there was nothing more OP could have done, so moving forward they could underscore how hurtful this dress incident was because of how OP was ignored. And/or have low expectations of her mom respecting her choices in the future. \n\nSorry about the dress, but maybe it\u2019s a mitzvah and you can do something with the skirt/train fabric! Take it to a tailor and have a fab reception dress made.", "Can you do something with the skirt and sleeves ?\n\nMaybe you could post a picture here?
