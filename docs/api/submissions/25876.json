We are both happily married and just friends, though we do catch up on life during work hours.\n\nMy husband has been away on a business trip for two weeks now. John and I were chatting in the office this morning and I mentioned to him that I've been at my house alone for the past week and pretty bored without my husband.\n\nHe asked me what I do to pass the time and that I must be a bit pent up with my husband gone for that long. I was surprised he said that but I feel comfortable enough around him that it didn't bother me and I chalked it up to playful banter.\n\nI jokingly told him that I know exactly how to please myself when my husband is away. He got really awkward and uncomfortable and we've been distant since.\n\nI just checked my inbox and there was a meeting on my calendar from HR. I tried to message John but he's not responding and my manager came by my desk and told me that my behavior is ridiculous and to not speak to John until I'm told otherwise.\n\nAITA?\n\n**Update**: I just got off my meeting with HR. I was able to convince everyone that it was just a misunderstanding and that I meant I can entertain myself while my husband is away. It's interesting though, John didn't bring up his comment in the HR complaint. I brought that up myself and he got scared and began to say that he meant it that I must be bored in the house all alone with nothing to do. I let him have it. They won't be pursuing a formal investigation because they're chalking it up to a misunderstanding, but they are keeping everything on record in case anything happens again. They are moving John to a different team temporarily and my manager apologized to me for being harsh with earlier. I will not be speaking to or interacting with John going forward.", "created_utc": 1693418734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165m05k/aita_for_implying_to_my_coworker_that_i_please/", "score": 3851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wow.\n\nWhen he says, \"Oh I didn't mean it that way,\" you can say \"Well, clearly I didn't mean my comment the way your filthy mind took it! You KNOW I love to cook. OF COURSE I was talking about cooking and eating whatever I want without worrying whether Husband will like it!\"\n\nIt *could* work.\n\nGood luck\n\nNTA", "I feel like you were both being inappropriate.", "NTA. When you get to HR, be utterly confused. *\"Yeah, I get to eat all the chocolate chip cookie dough by myself when my husband is gone - I don't even have to bake the cookies. Or clean up right away! I get to please myself and do what I want. I'm sorry, is there a problem?\"*", "ESH. I'm going to bold out what I think your biggest issue will be.\n\nEh, rule of thumb is, even if you think you're \"cool,\" the safest bet is to AVOID any sex talk, or implied sex talk, with someone at work. You could have turned him in if you wanted on the \"Don't you get pent up while you're husbands away?\" but since you responded that you know how to pleasure yourself, which is more graphic in HR terms than what he said, that let him open the door because **he most likely is going to say that he didn't mean \"pent up\" in the way you took it, and you made it sexual, even if you believe his intent was talking about sex.**\n\nIt sucks, but yeah realistically, SO MUCH can be considered sexual harassment. In work trainings, most will point out that sexual harassment can exist in little conversations, big conversations, in body movement, in the way things are phrased, in how you may say something, and sometimes in conversations you may think are okay. All it takes for it to go to HR is for someone to feel uncomfortable, it doesn't matter who started it at that point.\n\nNow do I think that the other guy should be talked too? Yeah, and honestly he probably has already been talked too because he took it to HR, but again, **you don't know if he's going to say \"I meant pent up like you're in the house all alone and you've been pent up in the house without your husband there\" but if he does then well.. that sucks and it'll be your job to open up the context of that conversation. If none of the conversation had been even alluding to be sexual up to that point then... well RIP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I almost want to guarantee you, he's going to say \"I meant how do you handle being pent up in the house... she made it weird.\"**", "Girl, you need to take up crocheting ASAP and bring half a baby blanket into that HR appointment with you so you can say \"This is what I was referring to.  It's how I please myself when my husband is gone.\"\n\nJohn is obviously feigning some sort of misunderstanding with his original \"pent up\" comment and your only defense is to do the same.\n\nESH.", "EW?!", "On the face of it, I'd say NTA. It sounds like you misunderstood what \"a bit pent up\" meant. If I'm \"pretty good friends\" w/someone I might feel comfortable making such a joke. \n\nI suppose the only thing you could've done was apologize once he became awkward, that might've cleared the air at the time. Too late now.\n\nI'd write down exactly what you recall from the conversation. Might be helpful for you, as you prepare to meet with HR.", "H u h\nI guess you read the air wrong.\nHe was asking how you killed time, lmao.\nNot sure if you're TA, this is quite the peculiar situation", "He maybe possibly meant \"pent up\" as like a cabin fever/bored kind of thing.

While I can see how you could have taken his comment as one about sex, it probably wasn't given his reaction, and even if it had been you shouldn't have engaged it.

I mean my workplaces have been in every sense of the word fucked up, so thats no reference, but i see miles between this and harassment, or catcalling or like unsolicited sextalk thats clearly crossing a line, like the coworker that is gross to be around bc they wont shut up abt what they like or what porno they whatched so like specific, (repeating) boundarycrossing stuff. \nIdfk this is my first day on reddit and its terrible.

I noticed that you wrote that you're both happily married, *though* you catch up on life during work hours. That doesn't sound perfectly happy to me. Regardless, you started talking about masturbation to a co-worker. That is not only inappropriate, but also just such a weird thing to do.

He did not mean angry nor wildly strong emotions, so he meant horny. Unless he used the word incorrectly.

You take that up higher and no one is going to say \u201cyou\u2019re right this vague statement is justifiable grounds for dismissal\u201d.

Coworker was clearly leading up to propositioning you, and went to HR when you shut it down. Read the room in your meeting, and go with whatever seems best at the time. If they're seeming to come down on any sexual talk, deny you meant anything sexual. If that doesn't seem to be an issue, hammer home the point that he was very obviously talking about sex and setting up to make a pass at you while husband was away, and you simply responded in kind so as to shut that down.", "YTA - you said you were bored without him. He said pent up unsexually, and you made it sexual.", "Yah if he wants to play that game then so can you. Technically nothing sexual was said and it\u2019s all insinuation. \nYou need to act APPALLED when you get called in to HR when they repeat what John apparently thinks you said. \nMaybe you go to the spa often, get your nails done, self pampering things, really \u201cplease\u201d yourself. \n\nFuck this guy for going straight to HR too and not just telling you he thinks it was inappropriate.", "NAH - This seems like an odd situation. A few thoughts - \n\nFrankly, John's comment (which was made first) seems to have the same level of sexual inuendo that your response did. Both comments can also both be equally as easily explained away. \n\nIt seems unlikely that John would be naive enough to not realize the sexual connotation of using the term \"pent up\" in regard to your husband being gone, but worldly enough to understand the sexual connotation of \"please myself\". However, I am going with a very hesitant NAH (for now) on the off chance that this was the case. Because if it was, he is within his rights to report that you made a sexual comment that made him uncomfortable.  \n\nYou commented that your husband wondered if this may be John trying to sabotage you. Which actually does seem possible. \n\nThere are also plenty of men out there who see zero issues with making sexual joke/comments about or too women, but are then horrified and legitimately (though ridiculously) offended when women respond in kind. \n\nThis seems like a strong reaction from HR, and your confusion about their strong response indicates that they don't typical react so swiftly. Which makes me wonder if John reported this as this as part of a pattern of behavior on your part (real, imagined, or fabricated). So be prepared for that. \n\nYou have two options for the meeting with HR. Be honest, and say that John made what you assumed was a joke with a sexual nature and you responded in a way that you felt matched the level he had taken the conversation to. Or, lie and act confused about why you are there and if asked, explain that by \"please yourself\" you meant watch your favorite shows and cook your favorite foods and what else could you have possibly meant. Think long an hard about any conversations you have already had with work people though, because if you get caught in that lie it is going to make things A LOT worse. \n\nTo be honest, it feels scummy to even acknowledge that for you to lie is an option, because you DID mean your comment in a sexual way. And men have been using that excuse forever to get away with inappropriate behavior. I wouldn't even suggest it if there wasn't the chance that John purposefully set you up for some reason and if I didn't feel that his initial comment was as inappropriate as yours - possibly more so since he \"started it\".", "Haha nta but a little too open at work with co-workers short and simple there's a reason you get paid to see them", "NTA Wow I'm surprised HR would be involved.", "NTA. John asked you a question about your sex life and you responded. I would be petty and file a grievance on him for asking a question sexual in nature.", "YTA, you should have known better than to have a conversation such as this at work.  You assumed that he was referring something of a sexual nature and responded in that direction.  Obviously he wasn't.  There is a reason why there are policies regarding this are in the work place.", "John is pathetic and needs to chill. You guys are friends. Whack move on his part imo\nNTA", "YTA. You know you are, that\u2019s why you\u2019re planning to lie to HR. You took his joke the wrong way and were inappropriate.", "I think he brought it up.  He\u2019s is the AH.", "YTA mostly because I wouldn\u2019t consider that topic playful banter if it were me or my wife having that conversation. It\u2019s inappropriate in a work setting and it\u2019s not really fair to your husband (would you say that comfortably to your coworker with your husband present?). \n\nIt sucks that John went and ratted on you rather than being a grownup and discussing his feeling and boundaries with you first. I was gonna e s h but it does seem like you crossed a bit of a line more in just your willingness to engage in that type of conversation in the first place.", "ESH, but him more so for making a leading comment then going to HR for your response.  The whole topic is inappropriate for work, and were I was you I'd come up with an alternate non-sexual explanation for your comment and use that in the meeting.", "A very light AH.  Pent up does not necessarily mean pent up sexually, you took it that way and responded in kind.  Fortunately your response was not blatantly sexual either so you should be able to explain it all away as him misunderstanding your response.  \n\nYou also don't know for sure it was John who complained to HR, it could have been someone overhearing par or all of the conversation.  If John was considered the victim in the telling, they would have gone to him first and got his version of events and told him not to speak to you until things are concluded.  \n\nThe only reason I judged as a light AH is because you really should know better than to say anything even slightly suggestive in the workplace.  No matter how well you know someone, you never really know what will trigger them and you never know who might overhear.  Hopefully there will be no negative repercussions for you because it was, IMO,  not worth bringing to HR.", "NTA\n\nHE brought up being pent up.

We are both happily married and just friends, though we do catch up on life during work hours.  \nMy husband has been away on a business trip for two weeks now. John and I were chatting in the office this morning and I mentioned to him that I've been at my house alone for the past week and pretty bored without my husband.  \nHe asked me what I do to pass the time and that I must be a bit pent up with my husband gone for that long. I was surprised he said that but I feel comfortable enough around him that it didn't bother me and I chalked it up to playful banter.  \nI jokingly told him that I know exactly how to please myself when my husband is away. He got really awkward and uncomfortable and we've been distant since.   \nI just checked my inbox and there was a meeting on my calendar from HR. I tried to message John but he's not responding and my manager came by my desk and told me that my behavior is ridiculous and to not speak to John until I'm told otherwise.  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
