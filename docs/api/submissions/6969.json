{"id": 6969, "submission_id": "1084ynf", "title": "AITA for telling my gf to contribute for my apartment?", "selftext": "So my gf (26f) was recently told to move out of her apartment within a month. She wants to move into my (27m) place since it's very large and in the city center closer to her work. She also doesn't want to deal with the hassle of finding a place to move into and paying up initial fees. She really likes my apartment since she can walk to work and there's space for her to do things like yoga and art.\n\nThe issue is, I currently make 120k and she makes 60k, and the apartment is 4k a month. She said she couldn't afford to go halves on rent which I agreed would be absurd, so I suggested that maybe she could pay 25% (1k a month) and I'd cover the other 75% (3k a month) and utilities. Since I'd still be paying more and I want to set boundaries to make it fair, I told her she could also help out in the apartment somehow, in a way that she feels comfortable. I currently cook all our meals whenever we eat together (she can't cook), so I told her she could think of her own way to contribute. She went silent after my suggestion, and our time together kind of ended that way.\n\nShe's been giving me the cold treatment since that talk two days ago, and today I received a text from her friend saying if I cared about her I'd let her live with me for free, and I was being a dick since I already pay the full rent anyways. \n\nAm I being the asshole in this situation? I feel my suggestion was fair, and it's not like I'm asking her to move in with me.\n\nFor some context\n\n* Her current rent is 1100 a month\n* We've been together for a year and a half\n* I work 50 hours a week, she works 40 hours\n* I hold a monthly house party of food and drinks with a pretty big group of friends, and I frequently have friends crashing at mine if they have a late night out in town (rather than them risk walking home and ubers are expensive here).

They're all really nice but I think her coming from a sheltered suburban upbringing it intimidates her.\n\n**\u30fbDoes your girlfriend ever treat you or pay for things like dinners or has it been you?**\n\nI'd say 80\\~90% of dates and gifts are paid by me, she only gives me gifts for my birthday, Christmas and Valentines, but I didn't mind this too much since I usually offer and I earn more.", "House sharing situation, her room mate that signed the lease is suddenly relocating overseas for a job, and the landlord told her that she'd have to cover double the rent from next month if she wants to stay.", "What does that have to do with anything? If anything that means the girlfriend definitely needs to contribute and pay instead of trying to leech off OP.", "40% salary on rent is not unusual in some major cities, London, New York, San Francisco etc", "Nothing about the post even suggests he wants a live in maid. He simply stated he thinks she should contribute \u201cin a way she finds comfortable.\u201d The girlfriend is the one that wants a live-in servant who cooks all the meals. And she wants a sugar daddy that pays all the bills. OP couldn\u2019t be any more reasonable with the GF.", "Agree, NTA this is totally bizarre. I don't understand how she would expect that moving in together means no more rent for her to pay!\n\nShe is treating you like a meal ticket not a partner. Massive red flags.", "Yikes, forgot to comment on that part! Honestly, I have a feeling it's probably more of a control thing. \n\nI know we don't know much about her, but I get a manipulative vibe from what little we do know. Plus, her friend texting OP and telling him that he should be living there for free? Yeah...that was 100% the girlfriend. Whether she borrowed her friends phone, or just flat-out told her what to say, it was the girlfriend.\n\nOP should run like hell. She's going to be a nightmare if she moves in and acts like she owns the place (the same place she feels no need to contribute to in any way whatsoever).", " \n\nHe will have to pay you rent and contribute to household chores or get his own place.", "Exactly! I would definitely draft a formal lease for this. Its shady as hell", "I love how sweet and kind you are towards your girlfriend, and I\u2019m sure she is sweet and good hearted in every other way. \n\n- Being laidback and \u201cjust taking it\u201d is an awesome mindset, but \u201cjust taking it\u201d sets people up to be taken advantage of, and it sends the message that they can keep doing it cause you do nothing about it. \n\n- Giving the cold shoulder actually is a form of abuse that\u2019s slowly being recognized. And if she\u2019s refusing to talk about the big stuff and just ices you out, and she snaps at you? That\u2019s not really okay behaviour. \n\n- She may not be trying to involve them, but she\u2019s not stopping it from happening either. You\u2019re in a monogamous relationship, meaning there\u2019s just two of you in this together, it\u2019s not you your girlfriend and Becky over there. It\u2019s fine to vent but that\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing anymore, she\u2019s poisoning the well and painting an unkind image of you and she\u2019s not trying to correct any negative images her friends are seeing that\u2019s causing them to hate you. \n\n- You not talking about your girlfriend to your friends sends me a minor flag, cause it kinda indicates that you\u2019re scared of what they\u2019ll think of her and the real reason may be that they may encourage you to reevaluate the relationship. You\u2019re being kind towards her while she\u2019s actively demonizing you without remorse. \n\n- Being raised suburban and sheltered doesn\u2019t exactly give her an excuse to be standoffish, has she even tried to get to know any of them besides fake smiles and nice greetings? \n\n- Materialistically you sound severely unbalanced and that may be why she assumed you\u2019d let her live with you for free. You pay for anything anyway so why would she think any different? That\u2019s kinda what I got from the last one. How are your love languages? Does she do nice things for you? Like order your favourite food, watch your favourite movies, stuff like that?", "Watch out my friend. You might get your heart broken by your girlfriend.  Do move in with her and you'll see her true colors. All the best", "> It sucks a bit since her friends don't like me now because of this\n\nSo she hates your friends, and her friends hate you. \n\nBasically, if you let her move in with you, you will be isolated from your friend group, and get treated like shit by her friends. \n\nYou should definitely not let her move in, and you should probably start rethinking your relationship.", "Yeah so I forgot to say those were after tax earnings, I never talk before tax cause I suck at calculating numbers haha.\n\nAlso I work from home and cook a lot, my hobbies don't cost a lot of money as well (gym, skateboarding, gaming) so I don't spend much money.\n\nRent comes to 48K a year so I have 72K a year to live off of, I think it's quite reasonable.", "That's interesting!  The standard rule in Australia is that rent cannot be more than 1/3 of wages or it's classed as \"housing stress\". I earn more than OP and there's no way I would feel comfortable paying that much in rent. I guess a lot depends on the other cost of living factors though.", "Yeah agreed, that part was super cringe. Like zero confrontation skills. I would run so fast, OP seems to be doing well, and could find a partner who could contribute much more equally.", "Thank you for the kind words, I really appreciate your feedback too!\n\n\u30fbI totally agree with this, which was one of the reasons why I wanted to create boundaries this time.\n\n\u30fbShe says she has trouble communicating in confrontational settings, even when it isn't confrontational she takes it that way. I try to give her time so she can have an honest conversation once she's sorted her emotions, but yeah, maybe this is toxic for both of us.\n\n\u30fbYeah, it's a little complicated because I do think she needs her friends to sort out her feelings, but some of her friends have already made up their minds about me (they all live in other cities so I've never met them in person) I've never had the chance to change their opinions of me.\n\n\u30fbWell I do this since if when my gf comes around, I want her to be able to fit into my social group. I've tried introducing her to my friends individually and in social settings, but she just stays quiet and hasn't made an effort. My friends want her to join us for things, they're all really nice to her since they know she's a little intimidated but it's been hard.\n\n\u30fbShe has a very pretty smile and is extremely nice, but she doesn't show her personality so I understand how it's hard to interact with her. She did go out for coffee with alone one of my friends but he's the nicest guy in the world and he's queer so I think she felt comfortable.\n\n\u30fbI think my love language is sharing experiences with travel, hobbies, entertainment, or just having really quality time alone whether that's silence, and also physicality is important. She appreciates all 5 forms of love language, so I think sometimes it's hard for her to know what to do for me since I'm satisfied quite easily, and I tend to always revert to logic over emotions and come off as a bit cold.", "It is wild to me that your extremely reasonable recommendation was met with such resistance. It is a major red flag that she is unwilling to pay anything. And an even bigger red flag that she refuses to talk to you about it. My now wife insisted on going half on rent (& utilities) when she moved in with me. I was a practicing lawyer and she was in grad school. I assume your apartment is high quality at that price point. She wants a better apartment, and wants it for free. That is insanely entitled.\n\nI was almost in your exact situation with my college GF. I wish I had paid attention to the red flags and not let her move in.", "It's often classified as housing stress in the US too - it's just that if you're in a high-rent city and not making a lot of money, you're short on options.", "I believe that Canada\u2019s definition in the dictionary is \u201chousing stress\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "You\u2019re welcome and here\u2019s more! \n\n- It\u2019s great you\u2019re setting boundaries cause they are very important! \n\n- Talk or DBT therapy is something she could look into. Because her inability to properly communicate is a her problem and she has to be the one to fix it and she has to want to fix it. She also needs to put in the work. Communication is one of the things that make a foundation of a relationship and if you don\u2019t have that then the relationship is going to run into some snags. \n\n- Unfortunately she sorted her feelings in a way where you\u2019re *always* in the wrong. That\u2019s toxic behaviour, and I\u2019m going to bring this up again - she\u2019s not doing much to fix it and she\u2019s not stopping to think \u201cwow my friends really hate my boyfriend.. but I love him and want them to think better of him.\u201d No, she\u2019s going \u201cugh he\u2019s such a dick\u201d which is again - toxic behaviour. And unfortunately your image to her friends is forever ruined, you\u2019ll never be able to meet them without being seen as some sort of an ass. And I\u2019m sorry for that because from our short interactions as strangers? You seem like a real genuine kind person, and you don\u2019t deserve to be treated like a monster for having *boundaries.* \n\n- You and your friends all sound like nice people who have tried to get her to come around. But only the queer friend managed because of their sexuality.. That\u2019s\u2026 Another red flag, sorry. She\u2019s not putting in any effort while you and your friends *are.* And she\u2019s practically snubbing them for absolutely *no* reason."]}
