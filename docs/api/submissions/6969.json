{"id": 6969, "submission_id": "1084ynf", "title": "AITA for telling my gf to contribute for my apartment?", "selftext": "So my gf (26f) was recently told to move out of her apartment within a month. She wants to move into my (27m) place since it's very large and in the city center closer to her work. She also doesn't want to deal with the hassle of finding a place to move into and paying up initial fees. She really likes my apartment since she can walk to work and there's space for her to do things like yoga and art.\n\nThe issue is, I currently make 120k and she makes 60k, and the apartment is 4k a month. She said she couldn't afford to go halves on rent which I agreed would be absurd, so I suggested that maybe she could pay 25% (1k a month) and I'd cover the other 75% (3k a month) and utilities. Since I'd still be paying more and I want to set boundaries to make it fair, I told her she could also help out in the apartment somehow, in a way that she feels comfortable. I currently cook all our meals whenever we eat together (she can't cook), so I told her she could think of her own way to contribute. She went silent after my suggestion, and our time together kind of ended that way.\n\nShe's been giving me the cold treatment since that talk two days ago, and today I received a text from her friend saying if I cared about her I'd let her live with me for free, and I was being a dick since I already pay the full rent anyways. \n\nAm I being the asshole in this situation? I feel my suggestion was fair, and it's not like I'm asking her to move in with me.\n\nFor some context\n\n* Her current rent is 1100 a month\n* We've been together for a year and a half\n* I work 50 hours a week, she works 40 hours\n* I hold a monthly house party of food and drinks with a pretty big group of friends, and I frequently have friends crashing at mine if they have a late night out in town (rather than them risk walking home and ubers are expensive here).

They're all really nice but I think her coming from a sheltered suburban upbringing it intimidates her.\n\n**\u30fbDoes your girlfriend ever treat you or pay for things like dinners or has it been you?**\n\nI'd say 80\\~90% of dates and gifts are paid by me, she only gives me gifts for my birthday, Christmas and Valentines, but I didn't mind this too much since I usually offer and I earn more.", "House sharing situation, her room mate that signed the lease is suddenly relocating overseas for a job, and the landlord told her that she'd have to cover double the rent from next month if she wants to stay.", "What does that have to do with anything?

I thought having you pay 1/4 of the rent when I only make twice what you do was very generous. I thought having you save on utilities was very generous. I've realized that isn't enough for you or your friends, so I think it'd be better if we continued living apart. I really care about you, and I don't want finances to hurt our relationship when it's clear we have very different expectations about what is fair financially.\"\n\nOP, I don't know how long you've been dating this woman, but it sounds like she thought she was going to get a free ride and is complaining to everyone about you. I wouldn't WANT to move in with someone who did this.

I'd stay firm with this.", "Right... She doesn't cook. She doesn't want to pay rent. She doesn't like your friends. She apparently doesn't want to clean. She's too lazy to find her own place to live. Might be time to call it quits and find someone the complete opposite of this lol", "I know, right? Like OP, wanna date me? I'd LOVE to pay $1000 to live in a $4k apartment. And never having to cook? Sign me tf up, I'll clean everything AND do the laundry. The gf is crazy for not seeing this as a great deal.", "This right here. \n\nI'm broke at the moment but I am doing what I can to pay my man back. Albeit it chores, actual money or rides etc... \n\nHer complaining to her friends and them attacking OP. Massive red flags. Those friends shouldn't be in the equation let alone attacking OP. \n\nI'd really have OP reevaluate this relationship as it sounds more like the gf is messing about and taking advantage of OP.", "Reading some of OPs comments it's really sad that he seems to genuinely love her and want to help her overcome what he sees are her issues, but all I got from his comments was that GF is a spoiled brat who bad mouths people, is extremely entitled and wants to be taken care of. \n\nShe never makes an effort with his friends after an year and a half of dating? That's not her being uncomfortable and intimated, that's her showing contempt for them and making absolutely no effort. \n\nYou're absolutely right that he should run. Very fast.\n\nShe can live rent free with the friend who sent him the text, as she is already paying her rent and it would make no difference apparently.", "I agree with this!  All of the other stuff about friends and parties and chores and whatnot aside, these 2 points right here are the crux of the matter.

They're all really nice but I think her coming from a sheltered suburban upbringing it intimidates her.\n\nIt really screams of classic abusive/controlling tactics, make an excuse to distance you from your friends and make you more dependent on her. It's absolutely absurd for someone to be intimidated by all of your friends and any successful relationship involves you making the effort to get to know your friends so you can all be friends together and enjoy doing things for the rest of your lives. She instead wants to isolate you from them.\n\nThe answer to being afraid of your friends is spend time with them, not get you not to see them. This is an absolute massive red flag.", "Oh, I see.  She needs to contribute in an equal way or she should find another place to go to be fair to OP!", "There are people, who can't follow instructions. But I agree. Basic cooking isn't rocket science.", "By the way, giving you the silent treatment and cold shoulder when she is upset is a form of abuse, it's emotional blackmail.\n\nThe fact that she only tells her friends about you when she is mad, and doesn't tell them how you treat her, how generous you are, or anything nice about you is toxic.\n\nYou are putting in all of your effort and she has put in absolutely nothing.\n\nYou guys are barely out of the honeymoon stage of the relationship, and she is demanding that you completely support her is outrageous.

I know she doesn't do this with bad will, it's just her way of stress relief. An example being she talks really poorly about her parents, about all of the trauma and issues she has with them, and at the beginning of the relationship before I knew how she communicated, I really thought her parents were horrible people. \n\nIt got to a point where I really resented her parents from the things she would tell me, and I had made up an image of how they were like in my head. It wasn't until later I found out her parents were great people and they support her a lot, and she loves them a lot, but because she mostly expresses negatives about people, and in contrast is happily quiet about positive things, I'm not sure if she knows how her venting skews the perception of these people from reality. \n\nI've been trying to help her change this, like if we're outside on a date she can get fixated on one thing like how cold it is, or how loud it is, and it ruins her mood. I try to change her perceptions to positive ones like how clear the sky is, or how good the coffee is, but she's drawn to negatives easily. That being said when she is in a good mood she has a beautiful mind and is really caring, it just swings hard from good to bad and no in between.", "I agree with the DBT therapy suggestion!", "She wants you to let her stay for free.  \nshe probably wants you to do all the work at home as well.  \nShe will save a lot of money from commuting from work to your place.\n\nshe is alienating you from your friends and has her friend send u a text guilting you into letting her stay for free...NOPE... think properly 2-3 abt her moving in with you nd possible reconsider the relationship.  \n\n\nNTA//", "NTA.

What\u2019s her reasoning? \n\nThis seems from the small details like a pretty one sided situation and you making a lot of sacrifices for someone who isn\u2019t willing to be an adult AND NOT CALL HER IMMATURE FRIENDS TO COMPLAIN WHO THEN CALL TEXT YOU to call you a non loving asshole cause you won\u2019t give it all to her free\u2026..please  look at this situation objectively and from an outside perspective.", "NTA, I\u2019d the rolls were Reversed everyone would be telling her that you\u2019re taking advantage and need to be an adult.

Your terms were very reasonable and the fact that she objects to them would indicate to me that she is an entitled woman who will use you for your money if you let her. Hold on to your boundaries and don't let her move in if she doesn't agree. As well you should get the terms of the agreement in writing", "NTA, but I can see a little of where some weirdness might come from. I've pretty consistently had an undermarket apartment, and I had an ex that made more than me. When we talked about moving in together, I got a little scuffed that a 50/50 split would end up being 300 more for me while he ended up saving about 1500. We didn't end up moving in together for other reasons, but it took me a while to understand why I was feeling weird about it. With her moving in, she's going to save about 100, but OP is going to end up saving 1k. I probably would have suggested around 800ish in rent for her, so the savings were split a little more. I'd tell her that zero rent would lead to you feeling resentful and ask her to come back with a more equitable split. If you're really ready to move in together, you really should be able to talk out this problem", "I think in sim. You are NTA.. but Y T A if you let her move in.
