Please refrain from any kind of social gatherings that might disturb my studying during this stressful time\".\n\nI didn't give much thought to it. I wasn't planning on a party as I said.\n\nOn Friday night I had my three closest friends come over. We didn't party. We just chilled at my apartment and had some low music which barely could be heard to my own bedroom let alone next door apartments.\n\nOn Saturday morning there was a note on the elevator once again, straight up naming me saying how \"Lady Y from the 7th floor and apartment number X broke the agreement and had a social gathering on Friday night completely disrespecting the stressful time I'm going through.
