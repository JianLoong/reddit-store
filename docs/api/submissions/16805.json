She was somewhat kind and having been through the stress of exams I was compassionate and agreed that I won't have any loud parties but I told her that my birthday is on May 5 and on Friday night I'd probably have a couple of friends over and have some low music.\n\nShe got annoyed when I told her that and told me that I better be quiet then. I didn't like her attitude considering the fact that I was trying to be empathetic and also told her I'd not do anything crazy for a party besides low music and some friends over.\n\nOn Thursday evening after I came back from work I saw two notes, one on the building entrance and one on the elevator which said \"I'm the college student from floor 7. Please refrain from any kind of social gatherings that might disturb my studying during this stressful time\".\n\nI didn't give much thought to it. I wasn't planning on a party as I said.\n\nOn Friday night I had my three closest friends come over. We didn't party. We just chilled at my apartment and had some low music which barely could be heard to my own bedroom let alone next door apartments.\n\nOn Saturday morning there was a note on the elevator once again, straight up naming me saying how \"Lady Y from the 7th floor and apartment number X broke the agreement and had a social gathering on Friday night completely disrespecting the stressful time I'm going through. She said she's be discreet but this is not enough. I could still hear some laughs and discussions because I had my windows and my balcony door open and disrupt my peace and focus. Let this be a lesson the next time someone decides to disrespect stressful times like this. You will be called out\".\n\nCertain neighbours defended me and said the college girl was being unreasonable with her demands but other neighbors believe I was an AH and that I should go to a restaurant or a bar instead of having a gathering at my house.", "created_utc": 1683647409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cwzgm/aita_for_having_a_party_at_my_apartment_while_a/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love that she thinks she can go around demanding that people not have guests *in their own homes* and then seems to think that this created some sort of \"agreement.\" If quiet is so important to her, then *she* can go somewhere else, like the library.", "NTA. Quiet studying is what the university library is for.", "NTA\n\nIf this girl really wanted peace, she would have shut her door and windows.\n\nAlso, expecting an entire apartment building to be silent and for no one to spend time with friends at home for a whole MONTH is not reasonable", "NTA. \n\n>  told me that I better be quiet then\n\nHow to get someone to throw the greatest rager of all time.", "NTA\n\nThis person is unhinged. There's no social agreement and all she is entitled to is typical noise levels (i.e. no blasting music) and quiet during quiet hours.", "NTA - She's the AH for asking too much of what are mostly total strangers. It's extremely presumptuous to ask this many people who you do not know to put a part of their lives on hold for a month. She can go find study areas at her school that are quiet an (usually) open 24 hours a day. Not your problem", "NTA. Has she heard of a library? Or oh idk. Closing the doors and windows? She can\u2019t expect everyone to put their lives on hold just for her. What would she do if she was living in a dorm? You didn\u2019t agree to anything. There was no legally binding contract saying you had to be completely silent and walk on eggshell covered thin ice around her. If you\u2019re gonna live in an apartment building you\u2019ll have to prepare to put up with some noise because it\u2019s not a little isolated hut on an otherwise deserted island, it\u2019s a building full of people who have lives outside of sitting in silence to please her.", "WOW. I mean... wow.\n\n/r/ImTheMainCharacter\n\nI'm the type to be empathetic, too, but that's too much. Anything above and beyond the noise ordinance guidelines for your area is a favor, but she's acting like your silence is her right.\n\nTell her to buy some f\\*cking earplugs.", "NTA.

She has no right to demand people not make noise because she is studying. She can study in a library or close her windows etc.   \nWhen you live in an appartmentbuilding, you'll need to learn to expect some sound from others. \n\nHer 'ask' was unreasonable and her calling you out was childish and petty. She needs to grow up.", "NTA the gall of her to act like a hall monitor is shocking. Imagine if she had spent all of that time studying?", "NTA- your neighbor has main character syndrome and seems to think that everything is about her. The audacity to go around door to door and tell people they need to be quite for 6 weeks so she can study!?! If she an issue with sound she should put in headphones or ear plugs.

Ignore her or report her to the RA.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not like you threw a rager, it was 3 people\u2026 How much noise can 3 people make? \n\nBut honestly, how she can waltz around expecting people to be quiet for a month is beyond me. She\u2019s the one being unreasonable here, not you. Sure, you can *ask* your neighbours whatever you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean they *have* to comply.", "NTA, you didn't do anything wrong. She on the other hand is harassing you. She lives in an apartment complex, her neighbors will occasionally have visitors, she can't dictate what everyone else is allowed to do within reason. I'd go print what the law says about it and post that where she posted her signs. It doesn't sound like you did anything that would break any laws or that was even remotely unreasonable. If she wants absolute quiet, she can go to a library to study.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your apartment. Sure, maybe you were a little louder than you thought to give her benefit of the doubt, but at the end of the day she\u2019s making demands of what people do in their own space.

She really needs to get a better grip on reality because she does NOT get to dictate the lives of everyone around her like that. Just wow.", "NTA.  Lol what entitlement!  The Queen is studying so all her subjects must remain silent!  Introduce her to the concept of earplugs.", "NTA\n\nShe was unreasonable. It's an apartment building. People are going to make noise. She can go to the library and study.", "NTA. If she wants some quiet, she should try the library or the dark side of the moon. It is not everyone else's job to be quiet. I would have an extra loud party just cause I am a vengeful person, especially with entitled people.", "NTA she sounds like a dick! \n\nHonestly she cannot control what neighbours do, there was no agreement, she made a request, you gave her the heads up. If she is that distracted by a few people and quiet music then she needs to figure out how she can be more focused. She has options, closing the balcony/windows for one, putting on music she likes, or ear plugs if she wants total silence. \n\nGoing to all apartments is weird in the first place, you don't preempt people are going to disturb you. if they are disturbing you and within reason, you speak to them as and when it happens. She's made herself look like a dick. You're fine.", "NTA. Your neighbor thinks she's the main character in everyone else's story.\n\nYou were under no obligation to honor her request but it was nice of you to be considerate.

Unreasonable request and behavior imo.", "NTA, but I am and petty and vindictive. The night before her exams, I'd throw a raging kegger.\n\nETA: spelling corrections.

This student has major issues and this one event is just the start of her hard life.", "NTA\u2014\u2014 one the music wasn\u2019t super loud or wasn\u2019t played until late at night, then she can\u2019t dictate what you can and can\u2019t do in your apartment! When I was in college, the library was open 24hours/day during Finals week, and they were lots of tables/study rooms available for use.  Maybe she can try studying there. -_-", "Lol. NTA. She should have closed her damn windows if she didn\u2019t want ANY sound coming in.. or get some headphones or plugs or whatever.

And it cracks me up that she thinks her posting a note constitutes an \"agreement\" on your part. If you have a decent relationship with your landlord or management company, I'd get in touch and say this woman is making you feel unsafe/uncomfortable in your home. I'd sure as heck feel unsafe if some random neighbor was posting notes criticizing my entirely acceptable behavior. My opinion is based on nearly 2 decades living in apartment buildings in NYC.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t own the apartment building, you were completely respectful to her the entire time and just had a few friends over for your birthday if that is too much maybe a dedicated study space would be good like hmm idk the library \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\nBut your neighbor sure is.\nWho the hell is she to demand everyone in the building cater to her?\nI\u2019d call the building manager on her.", "NTA\n\nWow, your neighbor\u2019s behavior is terrible & entitled.", "NTA.
