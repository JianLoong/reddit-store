Please refrain from any kind of social gatherings that might disturb my studying during this stressful time\".\n\nI didn't give much thought to it. I wasn't planning on a party as I said.\n\nOn Friday night I had my three closest friends come over. We didn't party. We just chilled at my apartment and had some low music which barely could be heard to my own bedroom let alone next door apartments.\n\nOn Saturday morning there was a note on the elevator once again, straight up naming me saying how \"Lady Y from the 7th floor and apartment number X broke the agreement and had a social gathering on Friday night completely disrespecting the stressful time I'm going through.

Let this be a lesson the next time someone decides to disrespect stressful times like this.

If my neighbor drops a note in my mailbox telling me I have to move my car, that I have to be quiet for four hours in the middle of a weekend afternoon, and that they may have guests park on my lawn? I'm not the one who started the adversarial relationship. \n\nAnd while it's likely that the dude was responding to their adversarial opening with retaliation, we don't know that for sure. Maybe that was the only free time he had to do lawn work for a couple weeks. \n\nI can see how, to some people, these might seem like benign requests. And I might agree, *if they had been requests*. But they weren't. They were demands, and the couple who wanted the whole neighborhood to put life on hold for their wedding didn't even have the courtesy to talk to their neighbors and ask them these things."]}
