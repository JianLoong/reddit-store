Please refrain from any kind of social gatherings that might disturb my studying during this stressful time\".\n\nI didn't give much thought to it. I wasn't planning on a party as I said.\n\nOn Friday night I had my three closest friends come over. We didn't party. We just chilled at my apartment and had some low music which barely could be heard to my own bedroom let alone next door apartments.\n\nOn Saturday morning there was a note on the elevator once again, straight up naming me saying how \"Lady Y from the 7th floor and apartment number X broke the agreement and had a social gathering on Friday night completely disrespecting the stressful time I'm going through.

Let this be a lesson the next time someone decides to disrespect stressful times like this.

If you are gonna get shit on for something might as well make it worth your while.", "NTA - Hahaha, you should hang a sign that says, \"No one cares about your exams. This isn't a library. Stop harassing people.\"", "NTA there\u2019s this great new invention called \u201cnoise-cancelling headphones.\u201d", "NTA, wtf is wrong with that gir? I'd be posting a response note directly next to her note like\n\n\"My sincerest apologies! I was still under the impression that this was my apartment, and hadn't realized you were taking over the building for an entire month! I expect that you will be compensating myself and everyone else in the building for the month's rent for which you claimed agency over these spaces? Unfortunately, until such payment is received, I will have to continue assuming that this is still my own home, and will celebrate my birthday as I see fit. Good luck on finals!\"", "NTA.", "NTA. I also live in an apartment and if one of my neighbors asked me this I\u2019d laugh in their face. Print out all these comments and tape them to her note. Then throw a normal volume party every Friday until the end of May. Your neighbor is nuts if she thinks she can ask an entire building to be quiet for a month. Maybe see if you know someone with a colicky baby and bring the baby over and see what the girl says.", "*On Saturday morning there was a note on the elevator once again, straight up naming me saying how \"Lady Y from the 7th floor and apartment number X broke the agreement and had a social gathering on Friday night completely disrespecting the stressful time I'm going through. She said she's be discreet but this is not enough. I could still hear some laughs and discussions because I had my windows and my balcony door open and disrupt my peace and focus. Let this be a lesson the next time someone decides to disrespect stressful times like this. You will be called out\".*\n\nWrite a note and tape it to the elevator.\n\nCollege student from the 7th floor does not own the building. It is unreasonable for her to demand that other tenants need to refrain from normal apartment living for a month because of a HER PROBLEM. If she can not figure out how to study with normal levels of noise from tenants who pay to live here, she can go somewhere else to study like her college library or study rooms. She left her windows and balcony doors open, did she expect the whole city to be quiet because she had to study? If she ever makes a ridiculous request like this again, the landlord will be notified that she is interfering in the rights of the tenants to enjoy their apartment.", "NTA. This is unhinged! If they need silence to study, then they need to go to the quiet/study section of the library.", "NTA\n\nShe has plenty of options such as noise canceling, white noise, going somewhere else to study... the audacity.", "NTA. Honestly, I'd talk to the management/landlord about this. No action item really just, put it on their radar that she's expecting complete silence with even her windows and doors open. She's a complete asshole.", "NTA.  You pay rent for your apartment.  You can do what the hell you like  the apartment you pay rent for. Your neighbor may be stressed but she is also disrespectful.  Her studies do not trump life in general. Her attitude is beyond entitled. You had a simple get-together for your bd, not a kegger.  She is lucky you're nice enough to ask if you are the AH. Someone with no fucks to give would have cursed her out.", "NTA. Fuck them kids.", "NTA\n\nI live in an apartment complex. I'm somebody who does not like noises. Every little noise distracts me, but I have strategies like putting on a fan so it drowns out noises. I also don't tell my neighbors they have to be completely silent. I complain about it, but don't make demands. Your neighbor is being unreasonable in demanding quiet. Also, what's up with your other neighbors? You get to celebrate your birthday wherever and however you like. Sorry if this sounds like ranting.", "NTA. This is completely crazy. I work shifts and don\u2019t get upset at people doing DIY while I\u2019m on night shifts and trying to sleep. That at least is noisy, it sounds like you had a quiet gathering and she could have closed her windows if she needed silence. She can\u2019t ask other people to pause their own lives", "Seriously NTA!! I would've told her \" you don't pay my rent here!\" Go directly to the Library do not pass GO!", "She should study at a library if she needs the peace and quiet that much. And/or get noise canceling headgear. If she were living in a dorm or something she might have a point, but she\u2019s living in a general apartment building apparently. You can\u2019t police your neighbors like that. She can ask for understanding, but nothing more. If someone doesn\u2019t want to than tough luck for her. She can\u2019t make her problem that of everyone else in the building. Especially not for a month.\n\nNTA", "Im sorry but is she the owner of the building? What makes her think she have the right to DEMAND for everyone else to modify their lives for her?\nAnd more important.... Why doesn't she close her frikin windows or wear headphones if she gets so easily distracted?\n\nYou are NTA at all, and are way better than me because I would have make it a point to have all the parties of the year concentrated in that time.", "Or use noise--canceling headphones.", "She\u2019s lucky OP has reported her to the apartment management for the audacity to dictate to other tenants what they can do in their own apartments. If they are still up, OP needs to get them and show them to management if needed.", "NTA - please tell me someone wrote back on the note and said that", "Headphones exist as well.  Jesus she sounds insufferable.", "She rents an apartment and not the building.  NTA.  She deserves to be called out.  She can put on head phones or better yet, go to the library, which is a quiet space.", "LOL\n\nHeadphones. Library. Turn on her favorite show/music.\n\nOr simply close your damn windows.\n\nI could think of some petty ways to respond...\nThe most inocent would be to gift her a PINK FLY PALLETE with a nice message \"to help her study, not even a fly should be around\".\n\nI bet that the other neighbors, who defended her, are as much as in need of a fly pallete as her.\n\n>I can hear you breathing... Stop\n\nMy husband isn't that nice. Disturbed, all the sound system at full volume (who knows how many speakers we have, but they're awesome at movies).\n\nThen the tribal soundtrack.\n\nMy youngest only slept on Disturbed \ud83d\ude05\n\nNTA but your neighbors are TA", "I would honestly take pictures of the notes and notify your landlord/leasing agent because calling you out by name when you're complying with the terms of your lease and accommodating her request within reason is not okay.", "Wait, what kind of building do you live in?  Is it a student dorm building or just a residential building with a variety of residents?  Because  if it's the latter then it's astounding she would have the cheek to ask the entire floor above and below her to not have gatherings for how many weeks?  Wow.  \n\nNTA.  If she need peace and quiet wear earplugs or noise cancelling headphones.  Also she needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her and plenty of people are studying exams in a lot worse living condition.", "You can also respond with your own note. \n\n\u201cLady Y from apartment x is laughing hysterically at the delusional College Student from apartment x who thinks that she controls the lives of everyone in the building. She needs to purchase noise canceling headphones, keep her windows closed or study in the library. Hope she passes her classes!\n\nLady Y will continue to go about her daily life and not adhere to the ridiculous edicts of College Student.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t really do this- it will only add fuel to the fire. But have lots of fun making up come-back notes. College student is being beyond controlling and is delusional if she thinks she has any control of what you do in your apartment as long as you\u2019re following the rules of the building. NTA", "That was my go-to in college. Half the time I didn\u2019t even have music playing in them, but they acted as sort of blinders to keep me focused on studying.", "I would have written \"I did not acquiesce to the Non-Gathering Accords of May 2023. Henceforth, be advised to vacate to the dungeon of learning, aka the library, or close your windows if you desire absolute silence. \n\n Toodaloo, \n\nYour friendly neighborhood person who exists at a reasonable volume.\"", "So, uh, what are your plans for every Friday for the rest of the month? :D", "Lol, this is ridiculous, NTA by a mile. I bet if you hadn't told her you were having friends over she wouldn't have even noticed it.

If she wants to dictate what everyone else does in the building, she can pay their rent. \n\nI'd happily be quiet as a little field mouse the whole month of May if someone paid my rent for me. \n\nBut until that happens, she can sit all the way down and mind her own damn business about what other people do in THEIR homes that they pay for!", "Even in a student dorm that wouldn't fly, the RA would just tell her to book a study room at the library.", "Life is short, party on a Tuesday night too!", "Even if I didn't have anyone over, there would be action movie nights every evening and video game marathons every weekend. Get some noise canceling headphones, find enough money to buy a house that doesn't share walls with other households, or shut the fuck up.", "As someone in an apartment in southeast USA, I also would have told her to F off. Colleges have libraries for finals week if you need silence. Also close your damn windows if you want silence.", "I have a set of tower speakers I haven't set up partly because I haven't been able to get a receiver/amp yet and partly because I live in an apartment.
