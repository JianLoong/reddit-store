My wife was vocal about their failures and was sent packing.  I wasn\u2019t angry as I told her to make an exit years prior, I saw it as an opportunity.\n\nShe immediately enrolled in a medical coding class and spent 3k on tuition but I still wasn\u2019t angry as she had a plan and was motivated.\n\nThe state takes six weeks to determine she doesn\u2019t qualify for unemployment because of how her employer notified the state.  Total dick love of a failing company.  \n\nBy middle of next week, she is working full time again, but she is still into this coding class.  \n\nThe problem is there is no balance.  She works from 7:30-4 (from home) and then studies until the kids bedtime.  I work from 6 am (construction manager) until 3 and then I\u2019m on parenting duty until bedtime.  I generally cook and do bath and bedtime routine.  She will come up and read to one of them at the very end.\n\nBiggest problem is the kids are conditioned to go to bed at 10 pm.

I have not a moment to breathe.\n\nWe got in a big fight about it cause I told her she has to help me change the bedtime and since school starting is the best opportunity.  \n\nShe claims I\u2019m not allowing her to study like she needs to.  \n\nI took it personal since I have been very accepting and easy about everything and when it\u2019s my turn to ask for something, she acts like I\u2019m bullying her and trying to stifle her plans.

It sucks that your wife had to take this much on in order to balance current need and her future goals.  The biggest downfall is that she can't give anything the full attention it needs, her job, her education, or her responsibilities at home. However, the situation she is in does not mean that 100% of childcare responsibility falls on you.  I agree that this is the perfect time to start readjusting to a new sleep schedule for the kids.
