They are going into Kindergarten and 2nd grade.  \n\nEarly May, my wife got fired after 22 years because her former employer had been hacked, ransomed and didn\u2019t inform patients for 5 months of exposed personal data.  My wife was vocal about their failures and was sent packing.  I wasn\u2019t angry as I told her to make an exit years prior, I saw it as an opportunity.\n\nShe immediately enrolled in a medical coding class and spent 3k on tuition but I still wasn\u2019t angry as she had a plan and was motivated.\n\nThe state takes six weeks to determine she doesn\u2019t qualify for unemployment because of how her employer notified the state.  Total dick love of a failing company.  \n\nBy middle of next week, she is working full time again, but she is still into this coding class.  \n\nThe problem is there is no balance.  She works from 7:30-4 (from home) and then studies until the kids bedtime.  I work from 6 am (construction manager) until 3 and then I\u2019m on parenting duty until bedtime.  I generally cook and do bath and bedtime routine.  She will come up and read to one of them at the very end.\n\nBiggest problem is the kids are conditioned to go to bed at 10 pm.  It\u2019s convenient for her since she works at home and if the kids sleep she has less distractions, but school is starting and I\u2019m starting to wear down.  I have not a moment to breathe.\n\nWe got in a big fight about it cause I told her she has to help me change the bedtime and since school starting is the best opportunity.  \n\nShe claims I\u2019m not allowing her to study like she needs to.  \n\nI took it personal since I have been very accepting and easy about everything and when it\u2019s my turn to ask for something, she acts like I\u2019m bullying her and trying to stifle her plans.  I just need her to balance better so that I don\u2019t burn out because I want her to succeed.", "created_utc": 1692986664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1616i6m/aita_for_asking_my_wife_for_a_little_help/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucks that your wife had to take this much on in order to balance current need and her future goals.

This class could get her a beneficial degree that she needs for a job with a considerable amount of pay.\n\nWould you tell somebody working at McDonald\u2019s to not take a class because they already have a job??  What about a nurse wanting the next level of certification??\n\nIt\u2019s not up us to decide if this class is \u201cworth it\u201d just because she has a job.\n\nEdit-My judgment would remain regardless of gender.", "Start bedtime an hour earlier.  It is a completely viable solution.  Bedtime routine at their age should be under 30 minutes.  Ask her to step in to say goodnight and give a hug and a kiss.  That way mommy is present and her concentration isn\u2019t completely destroyed.\n\nEdit-I mean this with sincerity.  2 school aged kids myself.  Bedtime routines can suck.  When mine fought and pushed we moved it an hour earlier so it\u2019d still be on track.  It can take awhile but you\u2019ll get there.", "It\u2019s sounds like a joint thing if you *both* turns.  You said you swap nightly.  You could have put them to bed earlier but chose not to.  You both are still at fault so let\u2019s not attempt to pin it all on your PITA wife (according to bio description)", "You\u2019re creating a scenario that we don\u2019t know is true based on what OP posted. But let\u2019s suppose that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m sure op would\u2019ve stated that and would\u2019ve supported it as well.", "We don\u2019t swap bedtime, we swap who puts which kid to sleep.  \n\nThe kids sleeping in is her reason for allowing the bedtime I. Her own words.  I\u2019ve been vocally opposing it all year, but I relented because it was summer and I try to pick my battles as I\u2019m not home during the day.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a change.  I don\u2019t understand her opposition to it.  \n\nIf I have to do it myself I will.  Just tell me not to expect any help and I will make the calls myself.  \n\nShe can\u2019t have expectations and then not be part of the process.", "So were you by saying class is optional and she already has a job.  We don\u2019t know what kind of job and what not.  He is the one who *was* supportive of her taking the class.\n\nEdit-Having *a* job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s *the* job.", "Swapping kids is still swapping.\n\nBut like I said I\u2019m another comment your resentment is showing.", "She has landed a new job commensurate with her old salary.  She works full time and gets help three days a week from her father while I am working.  She is not on her own. \n\nI want her to take this class.  She happier in this job and I am happy for her.\n\nBedtime has always been a joint effort and she has backed away to let me deal with it. The kids do not understand why they can\u2019t have mommy for bedtime and making the late bedtime worse in the interim.  \n\nMy biggest complaint is the kids bedtime and since she hasn\u2019t helped the kiddos understand it he situation, I am asking for help to adjust it.  The kids scream that it\u2019s not fair and they are t wrong. \n\nTBH it\u2019s just been frustrating for everyone.\n\nShe\u2019s a PITA for a host of reasons.  This is not one of them.  PITA is a playful term in our home."]}
