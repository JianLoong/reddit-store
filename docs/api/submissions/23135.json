Fancy cars are essentially the male equivalent of what designer clothes, bags, etc. are for women.  Yeah, it's his transportation but he can get to the same place just fine in a Prius for half the money.\n\nAnd the fact that he got so defensive is evidence that he knows that you are right but doesn't want to admit it.", "NTA\n\nThis guy is a misogynistic creep.  There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to tolerate this indefinitely.  End it now and move on.  He\u2019s not worth your time.", "NTA, your comment was correct. Can I ask why you\u2019re dating him tho? Do you want to build a life w a misogynist who puts down women simply bc they\u2019re into feminine things?", "NTA, you\u2019re spot-on.

Why isn't he your ex yet?", "NTA, and this sounds like he's projecting his financial insecurity and compensating through sexism. This would give me the ick, personally.", "Of course you\u2019re nta. You know that. He is sexist, and doesn\u2019t realize it because society has pushed the narrative that women\u2019s interests are bad and men\u2019s interests are good forever.", "NTA.  Your bf sounds like a condescending misogynist.  Luxury cars and nails are both luxuries -- there are economy cars that provide excellent transportation, but his Mercedes makes him happy (and possibly increases his attractiveness), just the way someone else's fancy nails might give them happiness.  He doesn't have a leg to stand on here.", "NTA.  You made a valid point and he's mad about it.     \n\n\nI used to complain all the time about designer bags and how I couldn't understand women who spent hundreds or thousands of dollars on bags when a $30 bag from a department store did the same job.   Then one day it hit me--I was wearing a $10,000 wedding band set.   At least a $10k purse has a purpose.   My jewelry was literally just shiny :P    \n\n\nWe all 'waste' money on different things.  Your BF needs to realize that just because he prioritizes his car over other luxury items doesn't make it less of a luxury.", "NTA, and why are you with this guy?", "No gonna lie he really does seem to be a sexist who enjoys shitting on the other sex.

So I can tell you that I'm not going to have much in common with someone who likes long fingernails and designer bags. \n\nBut your bf is an AH here.

It sounds like he's consistently criticizing things women do for their appearance, even to the point where he has criticized you for using *skincare*!  I feel like there's an issue with how he views women if he is really bringing this topic up that often and enjoying these kinds of rants.  \n\nAlso him saying he doesn't like things that \"women who aren't attractive use to look better than they do,\" gives me \"women should be beautiful but how dare they care about their looks\" vibes", "NTA He upset because he was being called out.

They expect women to be attractive,  disdain women who arent up to their \"standards\" and also complain when women use makeup,  accusing them of lying and attempting to mislead men. \n\nAs they say,  your BF has told you who he is,  the question is,  what are you going to do?\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nEverything you said is spot on, his views on women are messed up.
