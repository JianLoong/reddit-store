Feeling embarrassed, or wanting to leave as soon as you can. But the lack of consideration, even after the explanation, and way he was complaining about it makes me think it\u2019s more narcissistic than that. \n\nRegardless- I think that openly communicating about this might do you both some good. Open and calm, and talk about what bothered you. Relationships need good communication, and hopefully this can be sorted out. If it can\u2019t and this kind of behavior continues (treating service workers poorly, not cleaning up after himself, everything being about him and complaining that you embarrass him, make him look stupid etc), it might be red flags in the making.

The fact that he took offense over you calling him out and \u201cembarrassing him\u201d is an ego too easily bruised to tolerate long term.", "NTA. Leaving your litter behind is bad manners. You actually have the guts to call him out for it, and without causing a scene. He's TA.", "Former theater worker here: he\u2019s an AH and thank you for telling him so.

Your bf is not a nice person. Sorry.", "I bet he leaves his cart in a parking space too.", "That and, if he\u2019s embarrassed it means he knows he\u2019s wrong, which makes this worse.", "The trash here that needed to put on the bin is her so called boyfriend. She don't have to settle for less.", "Can do even the tiniest things which is picking up her leftovers, what more if it's big then I can't imagine what he would do.", "This is the best response\u2026. I think most of the responses are massively jumping to conclusions and overreacting.\n\nHowever, NTA, you raised it in an appropriate way, he can either defend his behaviour or do as you suggested. Either way as long as you both communicate with respect, then no one is being embarrassed or humiliated.", "I also think the same. Hes not yet there but he already showed her true colour.", "It's your job and not the workers job. He should revised her mindset then.", "A man should be gentle man enough to do her thing. He's the AH here, no more what ifs.", "Bet you know a lot about being single.", "I know right. It\u2019s just like scenario of seeing how a person treats their servers at a restaurant. Or the barista at the cafe. Yes, it\u2019s part of their job but it doesn\u2019t give you permission to be an arsehole either.\n\nI hope OP dumps this loser \u2018cause that\u2019s what he is. No values, no morals, no respect loser.", "It's so annoying right, hearing those kind of words to your partner makes it off to her.", "He's really annoying.

You do not go to the movies or stores or restaurants and just leave stuff for the employees to clean up.

He embarrassed himself. Throw that boy away with the trash, that's where he belongs.\n\nNTA - he should be an ex boyfriend asap.", "NTA, unless you sign up for a lifetime of being his at-home service worker.", "NTA\n\nHe should atleast have manner to pick his trash.

It\u2019s not hard to clean up after yourself at movies, restaurants, ballparks, etc. you take your trash with you until you find a trash can that you can put your trash in. \n\nHow would he feel if a guest to his house made a mess and just left it there because \u201cit\u2019s his house, so it\u2019s his job to clean it anyway\u201d?", "NTA - bet he\u2019s the same person who complains when screens aren\u2019t ready on time too because those workers are still cleaning. It\u2019s basic manners to take your rubbish when you go, and help the next showing run smoothly.", "Are you dating the stereotypical bad guy of every Christmas romance movie?\n\n\nIf so be prepared for some small home-town shenanigans where you'll meet a more down-to-earth guy who you'll fall madly in love with.", "You\u2019re not TA, but he sure as hell is. Dump him.", "It's not the workers job to pick up your trash. That's why there are trash cans by the theater doors.

His brain is very close to being fully developed. He knows better.", "I bet he doesn\u2019t believe in doing housework, cooking, cleaning, or even tidying up.  That\u2019s beneath him.", "NTA.  Better you know this about him now than later.  If he can't respect this space, do you think he'll respect a shared space with you later.", "NTA, As someone who used to work in the cinema, thank you.  We only have limited time to clean up multiple screens and the more rubbish there is, the less time we have to make sure everything is perfectly clean for the next showing. Basically, the more rubbish we have to collect, the worse your experience may be as a result.", "NTA\n\nBut your boyfriend 110% is.", "NTA,\n\nhim feeling embarrased means he knows what he should do and how things are normally done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou pointed out his manners and he didn't liked it.

What's his damage?", "NTA\n\nYou should\u2019ve called him to you like you would call a dog, then after he picked it up pet him on the head and congratulate him for doing a good job. That is humiliating for him, not your approach", "NTA, his understanding is \"it is not my job\", which really techinally you could argue that it isn't and the workers could. **But** it's like an unwritten rule not to be an ah and to pick up after yourself. Me personally, when I go on dates I always see how they interact with the people in the service industry. It is a red flag to me if they do things like he did or if they are just rude to them. That is the one and only date I would ever go on them with", "NTA, your bf is TA and is fragile and selfish to boot. His behavior is meh, not great, but his little tantrum is horrendous. Make him an ex", "NTA. Honestly, he is embarrassing you with that behavior.", "NTA\n\nPeople that leave their trash in the theater are no better than people that don't take their carts to the cart collection at the grocery store.

Sure there are workers that sweep or mop, but no need to make it harder for them. You don't have to pickup every morsel of food, but take your own trash. \n\n>car he was saying how stupid and embarrassing I made him look.\n\nHe made himself look that way. You can just joke about how his mommy will get it for him or mommy isn't here to pickup for him.

They wanted it cleaned and ready to be sat in 3-5 minutes. If everyone left their trash all over it would be impossible. My favorite thing was to walk into a theater and only have to throw about 5 things and spot sweep", "It's the same kind of people that abandon shopping carts in the middle of the parking", "Yes, there are workers hired to keep theatres clean, and it is a perfectly fine job to have. Why in the world would you go out of your way to make their job harder, just because you can?!?! There are people whose job it is to clean up bathrooms, and I still make sure that I pee IN (not on or around) the toilet.", "OP, dump this guy. You can see how he treats people who he's not trying to impress. One day, that will be you cleaning up all around his gross space after he trashes everything, and then insists that because he works two extra hours, you have to do all the cleaning.\n\nRun away! He's shown you who he is. Believe him!", "This is the perfect litmus test to determine whether or not there\u2019s a future.

I thought, \"yeah, let's see if I want to run away or kill you, after a few hours\". \n\nI saw him pull the cellophane off a pack of smokes and toss it out the window. Then, he flicked a butt out the window. \n\nI scoffed and said, \"Well, that's two strikes!\" He asked what I was talking about. I said, \"You always throw stuff out the window and litter? No wonder your truck is so clean.\"\n\nHe didn't say anything. Just gave me a couple of thoughtful looks.\n\nWe stopped about an hour later. He got some snacks and hung the bag on the armrest. That was 14 years, ago. I guarantee *nothing* has gone out his window, since. \n\nHe's also adopted my habit of putting out a smoke and keeping the butt in his pocket, or cigarette box until they can be properly disposed of in the trash. \n\nSome people can be taught. I doubt OP's boyfriend can be redeemed. He'd be a 3 strikes and out, for me. \n\nNTA.", "He's like a shitty man right.
