He left a mess for someone else to clean up and then blamed you for \"embarrassing\" him. Imagine being married to someone who treats people like that.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t see how you embarrassed him?\n\nPeople need to pick up after themselves. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US most businesses still have staffing problems.", "You did the right thing. It is never too late to teach people basic good manners.\n\nNTA", "Nta,  That was a total dick move on his part. That is absolutely not the employee's job to pick up after him. He embarrassed himself.", "NTA- Why does he think that theatres have trashcans at the exit if not to put your trash in? And even if he just happened to forget to pick up an empty container (which I've certainly done before)  it's not like you yelled at him or called him names or something, you merely pointed it out to him. I don\u2019t see how that's embarrassing. \n\nPersonally, I've found that if someone is rude to service workers or has a disrespectful attitude toward them like your BF then, that should be a huge red flag. That usually turns out to be the tip of the direspect/condescension iceberg in the long run. I don\u2019t have patience for people who don't treat people especially (usually low wage) service workers as they would want to be treated. And I'm sure your BF wouldn't appreciate people leaving their trash instead of putting it the trash can conveniently located at the exit if the roles were reversed.", "You can tell a lot about a person\u2019s character based on how they treats service employees. He\u2019s treating them like garbage and pretty soon he\u2019ll do the same to you. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour bf is the AH. He embarrassed himself by not cleaning after himself.  Basic manners to clean up after yourself.", "NTA, seems you discreetly brought his attention to the trash. It seems he was more embarrassed for himself for being called out in general. Had nothing to do with the people around you. He felt embarrassed because he realized he did something wrong and instead of admitting it, he got defensive.", "NTA. How does he treat waiters when your out? If this is how he treats people in the service industry it's showing you his morals and be prepared to have a filthy house if you guys live together because he seems like the type to say it's YOUR job to clean.", "NTA, you\u2019re BF is though.", "Yeah, you forgot to put the biggest piece of trash in the bin - your boyfriend. It's bad enough being a slob, but then giving your partner a hard time about picking up after yourself, that's a red flag.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a huge asshole. Is he leaving tips for the people cleaning up? They\u2019re not his fucking maids. He sucks. The turn around from movie to movie is insane and the fact that anything is clean is a miracle even when people do clean up their own trash.", "The smaller problem is the failure to clean up,after himself. The larger problem is his response to you reminding him. He could have said, \u201coh my bad, yeah let me get that\u201d, but he didn\u2019t, he blamed you for mentioning his bad behavior.  \n\nHe felt comfortable blaming you. That\u2019s a problem.", "NTA.

We take our empty popcorn bags and large carton to throw away (or to take and ask for a refill on our way out because the popcorn is just too good sometimes) in the trash outside the theatre. It just feels so wrong to leave trash behind when you are more than capable to do it yourself, so, thats what we do. \n\nUnless its like, bits of popcorn, candy or chips on the sticky floor, we usually throw away what we can. \n\nYour BF quite literally overreacted and no one would have cared if he left his trash or not, so I don't see the problem. Unless he was embarassed by the fact he ACTIVELY CHOSE to leave trash behind, knowing he was more than capable to do it himself but was probably lazy, that's on him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
