My stupid but well-meaning child brain thought leaving messes was doing them a favor by giving them something to get paid for.

One, otherwise a lot of times people are trying to cram it into too full cans outside (they often filled up from only 1/2 the theater exiting) and then there is popcorn etc all over the carpet. Second, you have to clean up anyway. Third, I often had a crush who I enjoyed cleaning the theater with.   \n\n\nbut the issue here is him throwing a temper tantrum when you asked him - it sounds like nicely and respectfully- to clean up.

I fail to see what you did wrong here, and it\u2019s a dick move on his part and his reasoning is just. Yikes. You weren\u2019t being unreasonable, just considerate, and him insisting you made him look stupid and embarrassing says a lot about him- I can understand social anxiety, feeling like everyone\u2019s looking at you and what not. Feeling embarrassed, or wanting to leave as soon as you can. But the lack of consideration, even after the explanation, and way he was complaining about it makes me think it\u2019s more narcissistic than that. \n\nRegardless- I think that openly communicating about this might do you both some good. Open and calm, and talk about what bothered you. Relationships need good communication, and hopefully this can be sorted out. If it can\u2019t and this kind of behavior continues (treating service workers poorly, not cleaning up after himself, everything being about him and complaining that you embarrass him, make him look stupid etc), it might be red flags in the making.
