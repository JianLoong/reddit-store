Feeling embarrassed, or wanting to leave as soon as you can. But the lack of consideration, even after the explanation, and way he was complaining about it makes me think it\u2019s more narcissistic than that. \n\nRegardless- I think that openly communicating about this might do you both some good. Open and calm, and talk about what bothered you. Relationships need good communication, and hopefully this can be sorted out. If it can\u2019t and this kind of behavior continues (treating service workers poorly, not cleaning up after himself, everything being about him and complaining that you embarrass him, make him look stupid etc), it might be red flags in the making.

It\u2019s not bullying someone to hold them accountable for their actions. And I know how to pick up my own trash :)", "I somewhat understand where you are coming from, but once again, I really don't understand how that applies to this situation. In general I wouldn't call out a random person like that (if for no other reason that not wanting to deal with potential drama), but when it is someone close to you, I think it is fair.", "That\u2019s the thing though, if everyone\u2019s always being non-confrontational to be \u201cpolite,\u201d no one ever learns how to actually behave properly. It may seem like a little thing, but a single course-correction can help to break a bad pattern.", "I\u2019m 35 and it\u2019s always been rude as hell to leave trash in a movie theater, even in the 80s and 90s. My mom grew up cleaning up after ourselves in the 50s and 60s, and she always had us gather everything while the credits rolled. Even did the same with my much older sister (51) during the bad old 70s. \n\nSeriously, whoever taught you that did you a disservice as well as everyone else around you. I guarantee you people found it rude then.", "NTA but your boyfriend sure is. Such a turn off", "NTA - you need a less sensitive bf one who would say \"Oh I forgot about that, thanks.\"", "NTA As someone whose job it was to do this for 2 years, Thank you. Cleaning up after yourself is basic decency. Leaving your trash when you literally pass trash cans on the way out is just lazy.", "NTA. He won\u2019t clean up his own messes and his ego is easily bruised by being called out? Do not move in with this man as he will consider cleaning to be your job now", "NTA. Find someone else who isn't a boor to go to movies with. Everywhere else too", "NTA. This is the type of thing that would honestly make me wonder that, if the relationship progressed, would he just expect me to clean up after him, like he doesn't lift a finger? Or puts whatever tasks on me bc stupid reasons that all amiunt to it being \"my job\"", "NTA He's embarrassed by his own actions. Scruffy git.", "I worked as an usher for a couple of years, and with theaters cutting staff left and right I feel leaving trash behind insures the jobs of the ushers.", "NTA but  you would be one if you stay with him.  He's a Grade A Asshole.  All work has dignity.  He's a jerk for looking down on the theater employees.", "NTA. He's shown you who he is, believe him the first time.", "NTA. People who purposely make someone\u2019s job harder are the jerks.", "What are there trash cans outside the theater then. He sounds like an asshole. NTA", "You learn a lot about a person by the way they see workers.", "Here you go OP. I found the prefix ex and a red flag on the cinema floor. Looks like your boyfriend dropped them. \n\nSeriously though, think about long term. When does \"that's workers jobs\" morph into \"that's women's work\" or \"that's a wife's job\"? How someone treats others, especially service workers, is a big indication of who they are as a person.", "Nta.", "NTA but you need to kick him to the curb he is a dick.", "NTA - The workers are there to cleanup spills and accidents. They are not there to pick up all of the patrons\u2019 trash that they are too slovenly to take to the trashcan.", "NTA\nYou Bf is a dick.. a proper arrogant prick", "Its not the worker\u2019s job to clean after your boyfriend, sure they do make sure its clean but seriously it would be for perhaps for food accidentally dropped not people deliberately doing this like your boyfriend. You seriously need to tell him that. NTA.", "NTA. I had that happen when I went to the movies with my sister once. After calling her out to pick up her mess, the employees waiting to clean stopped and thanked me. My sister now throws her own garbage out every time.", "Oh dear. NTA. And also, why are you with this malcontent? \n\nI've always considered how a person treats service workers as a pretty good indicator for their underlying personality. He fails the basic human decency test. And in my experience, men who fail this test tend to be rather chauvinistic in relationships. \n\nIf you stay with him, you'll be cleaning up his messes for the next 70 years.", "NAH, borderline YTA\n\nHes not wrong. You should get off your high horse though.", "NTA. Know what else would have not made him look bad? Him cleaning up after himself on his own. That would have looked *badass*.", "Boggles my mind. I can't imagine not taking my trash at the movies. Like sure, if I dropped some popcorn I'm not gonna be on hands and knees picking up a few kernels, but like taking your drink and packaging is so little effort.", "I stand behind my opinion that people who intentionally leave their trash in the movie theater are monsters.", "I mean, even Deadpool requests that you pick up your trash as you leave the theater.", "A red flag that will immediately make me walk away is being shitty to staff in a restaurant, another is littering, this is basically a combination of both.", "> People need to pick up after themselves.\n\nyes \n\n> If you\u2019re in the US most businesses still have staffing problems.\n\nnot relevant, and not op's problem or her boyfriend's. Most of the time it's really not that hard to find people to hire if you are offering a decent wage and decent working conditions.", "Hahaha your joking right?\n\nAre you a Top G Follower or something? \ud83d\ude02", "This!", "My least favorite thing to clean up was dip spit in tiny free water cups that wouldn't come out of the cup holders.", "> A used bloody tampon that some lady somehow changed mid-movie and left on the floor\n\nIt's truly amazing that I find other people being at cinemas a good enough reason to never go to them any more. Seriously though just hte basics of can't pee without potentially missing a crucial moment is a deal breaker for me, hearing other people eat, talk, argue, make phone calls, sticky floors, probably bodily fluid covered seating added to that and I don't know why anyone goes.", "I always thought it was weird so many people throw trash out the car window, too.  Especially non-biodegradable stuff, I wouldn\u2019t judge too harshly something like an apple core.", "First person I thought of too", "I\u2019ve worked in multiple theatres and you can absolutely work in one and have a great time, it just has to be more of a arthouse-y one that caters to a more mature audience that genuinely appreciates the art of film, preferably an independent one.", "Ruder to leave popcorn or to call someone else out for it?  I would argue the latter.  But try it next time you are at movie theater. Your mom grew up cleaning up after ourselves?  I am confused.  \n\nI am not defending leaving trash, but I can say where I came from it was not uncommon, and when I worked in a movie theater I never worried about it.  It's a quick clean up.  \n\nAs a maid, gathering towels all over the rooms was more annoying.  Also the lack of tips was annoying as well.  But I think that has changed for most.  At least it has for me, when I stay places."]}
