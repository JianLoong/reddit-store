I feel like this could\u2019ve all been avoided by not sending an 8 year old to a sleep over with two 14 year olds. While I\u2019m sure they are great brothers and love each other, there is an age and maturity gap. And clearly those gaps are rearing their heads bc your 8yo can\u2019t even be in the next room from a scary movie.", "so..alan is a better father to james than his actual dad?", "Can we talk a sec about this IATAH question turned into a thread of similar stories, of how people's parents traumatized them with things like this. \n\nChildren never forget... and it all bleeds into how we become adults in the future.\n\nNTA.. your husband sounds like a jerk  and he better fix himself before the kids grow up and learn to hate him for the things he did.", "Yeah it\u2019s great that at 14 he\u2019s sticking up for his brother like that", "Absolutely all of this. 14 year old is a hero and OP needs to rethink why she\u2019s married to someone less mature than a literal kid.", "Apparently, you didn't understand my comment, I am from a different time and perhaps culture. Adults are not perfect, but as a child you should stay in your lane and let another adult handle the situation.\n\nIt seems like you are angry for how you have been treated and not the situation in the post and speaking of being disrespectful you have just done that in your response to me. Think about that for a moment", "The father could have used earphones so it wouldn't keep the boys awake. Dude sounds selfish", "Wait... Do YOU have everything off (no TV, no sounds) when the youngest CHILD goes to bed????? \n\nI can see 'no scary movie when kid is scared', but NOTHING allowed ever because child's bedtime? That's nuts!", "Excuses, excuses. That\u2019s all you can manage. ESH, except your kids.", "You\u2019ve \u201ctold\u201d him? Great. Clearly that\u2019s working out well for your family.", "You kind of give up certain comforts when you have kids.  He should respect the kids more.", "Don't have people over to watch a movie if your place isn't big enough to do it without bothering anyone else in the house.", "So is OP for tolerating it.", "This right here. OP\u2019s responses are weak and pathetic. \n\nJFC, lady, these are your children and you\u2019re letting your husband mock and frighten them. And all you can manage to do is mewl that you \u201ctold him\u201d to be quiet, like that\u2019s going to make a difference.", "[removed]", "YTA\nYour husband sound like a high school boy and he is 42!!!\nGirls choose wisely or you are gonna end with one of these.", "10 pm and your 8 y/o kid is still up on a school night. Hey, your parenting ideas don't line up with mine, but since you posted.. yes! you are T.A.H. Kids do not dictate what parents watch on TV. Dad def has a vote on what he watches on TV, and with whom. Now, Dad gets chewed out and in the dog house for what? Clearly past bedtime for the child, who literally has NO vote past prime time TV. Helicopter parenting at it's worst right here.", "NTA. Your husband is.\nAnd you raised a great kid.", "NTA.  Your husband sounds pretty awful toward your kids\u2014 particularly your youngest.  To make fun of an 8 year old and have his adult friends join in on that is really gross and mean.  Your husband needs to grow up.", "NTA, Alan did so good and I think you've raised wonderful caring boys. Make sure your kids still know that they can speak up about their needs. Don't let your husband get away with being an asshat like this, he needs to learn that being a parent isn't part time, it's about ALWAYS being considerate of your kids needs and feelings.", "NTA and your husband not being able to apologize to his kids for messing up is a red flag in my book", "As well as the father and James\u2019s relationship, though that one is clearly more obviously strained since the father was literally bullying James. It also makes me wonder if the crappy father is why Alan and James are so close despite being 14 and 8. My father was verbally abusive and I shared a room with my younger sisters growing up at both our mom\u2019s and dad\u2019s houses. My sisters and I are very close now, unpacking our trauma and having spent so much time bonding growing up. Our relationship with our father is mended but it\u2019ll never be perfect because he just isn\u2019t all there.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If you are that upset you can sleep on the couch.", "Why couldn\u2019t he just turn it down ? And close the door to ur kids room ? Idk I get it but I still would be kinda annoyed that even without the kids around I have to sensor what I\u2019m watching maybe you could get him some wireless headphones or something when he wants to watch what he wants for a compromise so we can still watch what he wants and the kids don\u2019t hear it", "I really like Alan. While I know he's the one who told scary stories initially that scared his brother he is taking responsibility for that and showing sympathy and consideration towards his brother and looking after him. He learned from his experience.\n\nHe seems a lot more mature than the dad.\n\nOP raised a good kid."]}
