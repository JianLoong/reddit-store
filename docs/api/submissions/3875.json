Stop coddling them", "I never suggested that she should try to injure his pride, I just don't think that his pride matters at all if his pride is damaged by him not getting to bully his kids.  You are the one who is saying that his pride is so important and that he can't apologize for being an asshole because his pride is hurt.  He doesn't get the luxury of demanding that his pride be protected when he can't even treat others with basic respect.   \n\nIgnoring what will be effective in a single-minded determination to counter someone's pride is . . . pride.\n\nBut that's not what she was doing, she simply put a stop to a problem situation that was harmful to her children.", "Might be how it works for you. That's not how it is for everyone. It's easy for a story, especially one told by a child, to feel somewhat... detached. You can tell me a story about a serial killer all day long. But horror movies always get to me. They're loud, jumpy, and gross. The scores are specifically tuned to induce feelings of fear and paranoia. Sounds like screams and acts of violence are amplified to make each kill feel more impactful. That's a lot more than a couple of eight year olds with flashlights telling the tale of casper the less friendly ghost.", "Regardless of if I've been mocked or not, mocking is bullying and you don't bully children. You shouldn't be bullying anyone, but especially not a child.", "Misogynistic much", "Why because she set boundaries?? Men really hate those, huh?", "i am in awe at what you just wrote dude. i cannot believe there are people in this world that think that way. i sincerely hope you don\u2019t have any children currently or in the future", "Why would you respect someone who shows you no respect? That's kinda dumb to assume of children.", "Couple of 14 year olds can tell pretty convincing story to 8 years olds...", "Just so you know..Their father is human and taking the moral high ground is good but everyone eventually does that shit they said they wouldn't do.", "No only when they are outlandish.  Sometimes its good to put the kids to bed early on some nights", "Thats fine. I cant help the way you feel. Its just my opinion.", "Creating entitled lil dip sticks to run around causing havoc is why there is a teacher shortage. I feel bad for teachers.", "[removed]", "I'm well aware that he is human, but he is also a parent. Parents have a responsibility to their children.  I have children myself and I would never treat them like this. Are you forgetting that the children are also human and have needs that aren't being met by dad? Children have a need for safety and nothing he did in this made his children feel safe. It sounds like the only person here you care about being \"hurt\" is dad.", "No letting ADULT MEN make fun of your kids is not an outlandish boundary. Also, watching movies WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE while the kids are asleep is something disrespectful to those sleeping. If anything there are more boundaries needed here. The husband needs to grow the fuck up and start acting like a father, not like a spoiled teen. You probably too.", "Lol are you a gen x", "I'm pretty sure there's a teacher shortage due to teachers not getting paid enough, nice straw man tho.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
