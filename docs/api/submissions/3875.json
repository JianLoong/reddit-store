An 8 year old shouldn't have to be scared because his dad is watching a scary movie next to the boys bedrooms. That's a recipe for nightmares, for sure. Kudos to your older son for taking the initiative to protect his brother and bad on grown men for mocking the 8 year old. A conversation with your hubby is definitely needed here.", "NTA. The way you wrote this I thought that your husband was maybe a stepparent. It seems you have mentally decided you\u2019re a single parent. I hope that you find the strength, money, or whatever it is you need to make you leave this man. You deserve to be happy and your kids deserve to grow up in a healthy environment. I hope that you can see the red flags from your post and your comments. Be safe.", "NTA for this situation, but I grew up with a dad like this and it ruined my sleep for life. He always said he couldn\u2019t listen to his music loud after school as a kid because his parents didn\u2019t want to hear it, he couldn\u2019t listen to his music loud as a young adult because he had a roommate and lived in an apartment, so he didn\u2019t care that the kids were supposed to be sleeping or that my mom was trying to sleep- he was going to listen to his music as loud as he wanted because it was his house. I learned to sleep through it, just like your kids, by putting in headphones and playing my own music loud enough to drown out him and his friends or my parents arguing. Now I physically can\u2019t sleep without a certain level of noise, and it has caused relationship issues in the past. I literally wake up if it\u2019s too quiet. Please don\u2019t let him steamroll you and your kids like this. Protect your children because this IS psychologically damaging. Sleep is a basic human necessity, and at their age it\u2019s even more important than as a fully matured adult. YWBTA if you continue to let your husband treat you and your children the way you described in your post and comments. If he\u2019s not going to change you have to get your kids out, you all deserve better.", "NTA", "NTA. Your husband owes your son an apology. His behavior is classic toxic masculinity, and your husband needs to understand you won't tolerate bullying in your household.", "NTA - The fact that your 14 year old had to take initiative over his father in order to care for and protect his little brother is apalling. I find it incredibly cruel for a father to pick on his own children in such a way, and I think that you acted well in response to his actions.

A bit concerned that an 8 year old is going to a sleepover with 14 year olds. \n\nTo me it means Alan is forced to take his little brother with him when he goes out.
