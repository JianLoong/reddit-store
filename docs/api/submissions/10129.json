Not only did your gf do a MASSIVE solid for your sister, she did it with no issue or complaints. For your sister to completely disrespect your gf\u2019s notes and then get salty because she can\u2019t get them anymore is really childish. I can\u2019t think of any instances where someone was able to get years worth of notes from anyone, so this was a huge advantage for you sister that she completely blew. Doesn\u2019t matter if she blames you or your gf, because either way, the only true person to blame is herself. Also, you shouldn\u2019t have to talk with any adult about taking care of borrowed items, so just saying no to her request was completely appropriate.", "Nta. She should have known at her age to respect someone else's belongings and not crumpled them, put things back where she got them etc. You could have said something and how upset it made your wife but ultimately you are not an ah for refusing to lend materials to someone who previously disrespected said materials.", "NTA. If your girlfriend managed to take notes and become a teacher your sister certainly can do the same. It doesn't matter that gf is OCD. Your sister was careless with your gf's property.", "NTA. Why would you need to explain to a grown ass adult that when you return something you\u2019ve borrowed in worse condition than when you got it, chances are you won\u2019t be allowed to borrow the item again? She showed a lack of respect and care towards your girlfriend\u2019s possession - there is no need to sit down and talk with her about what she did wrong as she knows she crumpled up pages or shoved pages into the wrong place. She isn\u2019t a child who has no concept about why her behavior was unacceptable and can forego the \u201cpunishment\u201d of not being allowed to have access to those notes again. Why didn\u2019t she just drive the notes to a store that has a photocopier and make a full set all at once?", "NTA.  Your sister is not entitled to your gf's notes.  She could have offered to be more careful with them, but she told you to tell your gf not to complain instead.  She's being inconside and self centered. The way your gf was willing to lend the notes to your sister if you wanted her to shows how much she respects you, and you did the right thing by deciding what to do based on your respect for her.  Good job OP.", "NTA after reading the comment about how they treat your gf this makes the situation even worse", "NTA. A natural consequence of not taking care of someone's borrowed belongings is to no longer have access to borrow said belongings in the future.  She should have taken care of your sisters notes when she used them and then this would not be an issue.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should have been more careful with someone elses notes. and you could have explained why you said no.\n\nBut really, at the end of the day, your sister should be doing the work herself and not using someone elses work.", "NTA - if someone is doing you a favor and loaning you material, you leave it in the same condition as you received it.  They shouldn\u2019t have to tell you not to crumple pages and disorganizing them.\nYour brother was right in not letting you borrow any of them again.", "NTA for saying no, but you went about this in a way that exacerbated the situation. I agree that you should have spoken to your sister and explained why you were saying no. Even better, your girlfriend should have addressed the problem at the time of the original incident instead of making you be the middleman. \n\nAfter writing out my thoughts I feel like your girlfriend is the real AH here (though softly).", "INFO....Why couldn't your wife make the call on her own?  This seems rather sheepish.", "Eh, it would've been a better and more charitable move to explain to your sister how her actions effected your GF.\n\nLike your sis probably didn't realize it ass such a big deal.\n\nNAH imo but give her a second chance", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mother is putting blood before your girlfriend; your mother is also in the wrong.\n\nYour sister is old enough to figure out how to do her job without whining about losing access to your girlfriend's notes, and causing trouble between your family and your girlfriend. \n\nYour sister was disrespectful / careless, and is now acting petulant and entitled. Good for you for establishing healthy boundaries and protecting your girlfriend from that.", "NTA but.... We live in a digital age? Why can't you just take pictures of the notes and send them to her? If she wants them on paper she can write down the things she wants to keep herself. Then no one has to touch the original copies.", "YTA  you could have had a discussion with her about it first.  Unless you know she did it deliberately.  \n\nAlso is copying them an option?  If so, offer to make a copy of everything at your sisters expense.  Similar to paying for a study guide.", "Because she didn\u2019t want to say no to my sister and cause conflict, my sister/mother don\u2019t really get along with my girlfriend", "I think it's weird that he has to tell his sister to be respectful of something she is borrowing. That should be the norm. You should treat someone else's belongings with extra care. If you can't do that, you don't get the privilege of borrowing something next time. Especially with something that the gf clearly spent significant time on (not just the years of data but the hours that went into each individual lesson plan).", "Then you need to cover all the bases when you talk to your mom and your sister at the same time, not two different conversations. They have a LOT of nerve begging your gf for help as they've done nothing to foster a respectful relationship with her.  Mom can stay out of this one instead of butting in with her two cents. Next time sis needs help understanding a concept find someone else she's not on good terms with because they won't be leveraging your relationship with them to bully your gf.", "So you have a girlfriend and wife? I\u2019m confused sorry.", "Just girlfriend; sorry for the confusion", "Haha makes more sense! I couldn\u2019t tell if it was one or two people when reading thx", "NTA. your gf is not responsible for how well your sister does in school; your sister is responsible for that. and why would she damage notes she apparently finds super valuable, not to mention assume she can get access after clearly ruining them?? she's sounds entitled. especially for bringin in y'alls mom?? lol if my brother or i pulled that, our mom would get mad at us for being disrespectful to someone else's property, then ask why we weren't doing our homework and tell us how we should be going to office hours and or joining a study group if we needed that much help.", "What happened to your sister's notes?", "NTA, and good on you for prioritizing your GF's mental wellness over your sister's demands, even when your GF was gracious enough to risk a repeat of that experience just in order to help out.", "NTA.  I took very, very good notes when I was studying for my master's degree in the late 2000s, and classmates often asked to borrow them.  Admittedly, that meant taking them down to the copy shop or library and photocopying them, not working directly from them.  But it was well understood that when you borrow someone's notes, you treat them like gold, because they are someone else's possession.", "Surely the easiest solution here is to have her make a digital copy infront of you or with you of whatever she needs. That way the notes stay in your sight and its an hours work tops. Everyone is happy."]}
