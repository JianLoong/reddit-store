Everyone brings a dish and we all spend time catching up in the backyard etc. It's become a sort of tradition that we've had for many years. This year, I offered to host, as I haven't hosted since my kids were born.\n\nThe first guest arrived and I was shocked to see that they'd brought their dog along with them. I made a casual remark, \"Oh...you decided to bring Rufus\", to which he simply said \"Yeah, I've always brought him along\". It dawned on me then that in the past, people had all brought their dogs along as it had been dog owners hosting (at least for the previous 3 years). I had completely overlooked the fact that people may not assume that, since I don't have dogs, they aren't welcome.\n\nThe guests kept pouring in, and of the 15-16 families there, about half of them brought their four-legged friends with them. That was about 8 or 9 dogs all up, the place was chaotic. I have a large yard so it wasn't necessarily a space issue, I just don't like dogs. \n\nLater on everyone went inside to sing some Christmas carols when it got dark. Most people left their dogs outside but a couple of people brought theirs inside. Honestly, I think that having the gall to do that is something else. To make things worse, while everyone was gathered around, one of the guests' black Labrador lifted its leg on our Christmas tree...which of course got a collective laugh from the crowd.\n\nThat dog's owner apologised to me later that night, and offered to pay for cleaning costs. I explained that I was just taken unaware by the whole situation, but the owner just told me I should have either made my expectations clear beforehand, or told them to take the dogs home (which was down the road for most of them). Honestly, I think I was just too flustered to know what to do. However, I also told the owner that they should probably ask before bringing their dogs, which made them defensive. They told me that I was being unrealistic and that they'd brought them to every Christmas party for the past 5 years. They said that the kids really enjoyed having the dogs around and that I was being a killjoy.\n\nThis morning I went out to the yard to clean up, and I've found two piles of dog poop on the lawn. Side note - should I be looking for other piles of dog poop? Because I don't see how 7-8 dogs only left that amount. A couple of my flower beds have been flattened, but apart from that not much else has been damaged. However my living room has SO MUCH hair all through it from the dogs, especially from the Labrador and one of the German Shepherds. It's just everywhere and I don't know how to remove it. I have half a mind to group text everyone and ask them to clean up their dogs' shit and pay the cleaning fee for me.\n\nRegardless, AITA for not wanting them at my Christmas party?", "created_utc": 1701704518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18amurv/aita_for_not_wanting_dogs_at_my_christmas_party/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You saw dogs at every other one of these things, you say, so you had every reason to expect they'd bring them. You chose to say nothing, and now want to punish them for not reading your mind.\n\nMeanwhile, I do nonetheless agree that regardless of what happens at other houses, they should have asked you.

If you didn\u2019t want dogs to attend when you were hosting you should have said so. If you wanted them to take them home, you should\u2019ve said so. If you didnt want them to come inside, you should have said so. They are not mind readers.", "NTA for not wanting them, but that one owner is 100% correct though. As a host, you need to communicate expectations like this well before the party, especially if this is a long standing tradition in your neighborhood and dogs were always welcome before so I understand why they didn\u2019t expect this to be different this time.\n\nIn the future either or don\u2019t host or make it very clear that pets are not allowed ahead of time", "NAH But this was your mistake.", "NAH.\n\nI\u2019d usually be against people showing up to events with dogs unannounced but if they bring them every year, it was up to you to let them know that they weren\u2019t welcome this year, and especially up to you to tell them to leave the dogs in the backyard. You can\u2019t expect people to just read your mind. You\u2019d be fine to say no dogs on your property, you\u2019d be especially fine to say no dogs in your house but you need to communicate that.\n\nTo answer your question about poop\u2026I can\u2019t say there won\u2019t be more anywhere but it\u2019s entirely possible that that many dogs only left two piles of poop. My dog poops usually only once a day so if he\u2019s already gone that day, which I\u2019d definitely try to get him to do if I\u2019m taking him somewhere, he won\u2019t go again.", "NTA for not wanting them, but you should have **told them** that you didn't want dogs.\n\nI mean, you said that they had brought their dogs \"to every Christmas party for the past 5 years.\" **Of course** they will bring them again!", "NTA for not wanting dogs there.\n\nYTA for not letting people know ahead of time when they have been able to bring their dogs for years.\n\nAlso YTA for not using your grown-up words and telling them when they arrived that you did not want the dogs there. They live on your street and it would only have taken a minute or two to take their dogs home. Most would have been fine with that and if not, they can leave.\n\nIf you don't tell people what you want you can't complain if they get it wrong.", "NAH if the established precedent was that dogs are welcome to an outside event, it would be on you to change everyone's expectations. I assume it simply did not occur to you, which is why on this occasion you are not the asshole. \n\nBut you will be if you keep being bitter about it and don't just chalk it up to a lesson learned and your turn at hosting over for a decade.", "Cleaning up two piles of dog poop on the lawn is pretty easy compared to cleanup up the messes the human guests will make, but I imagine there are only two because the owners cleaned up the rest. \n\nMy mind is boogling over the dog peeing on your Christmas tree. I don't know where I would start first to clean that up. Did it get on a carpet below the tree? I can even imagine the pee shorting out the lights. LOL. I am not a dog owner and I, too, would be horrified. \n\nNext year if you decide to host the party again, say \"No dogs please\". If they don't like it, they can host in the future.", "NAH\n\nI was tempted to call you an AH, but ultimately, you didn't really do anything wrong.\n\nHowever, the only one being unreasonable here is you. There is an established precedent for people bringing dogs to this event. No one who brought a dog did anything wrong.\n\nYes, the owner of the dog who peed on your tree is a bad owner and should definitely pay for cleaning.\n\nIt is on you to be aware of these things. It is on your to specify, \"please don't bring your dogs\" or at least \"please leave your dogs in the back yard.\"\n\n---\n\nIn general, thoughts, desires, and feelings don't an ass hole make. Not wanting something in and of itself can't make you an asshole.\n\nTo be an asshole, you have to act. (or speak).

YTA.\nThe peeing and pooping dog should come back and clean up after them.", "NAH because you\u2019re right, people shouldn\u2019t just assume they can bring a dog over to someone\u2019s house. It\u2019s very entitled to think you can do that. I would sum this up as a communication issue and next time let anyone know beforehand that you don\u2019t allow dogs in the home.

You don't like dogs, I don't like you.", "NTA - the entitlement of people now days to bring their dogs everywhere they go!  I have owned dogs all my life and would never take my dog anywhere without asking.  I would definitely tell the labrador owner you'll send him the bill.  As for the other, since you didn't speak up during the process, you'll only make yourself look like a jerk bringing it up after the fact.  For future reference, I would either not host in the future or make sure that you have a no pet allowed policy noted on any holiday party invite.", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous that you need to specify for everyone nowadays that your dog can or can\u2019t come. It should be automatic that your pet needs to stay home when going to visit someone else\u2019s home. Especially if the host doesn\u2019t have dogs.", "NAH chalk it up to a learning experience and be clear with your invite next time. I'm a dog owner but would never personally bring my dog into someone else's home without asking; their yard, maybe,  but I get why your neighbors might have thought it was fine especially as you didn't say anything in the moment.", "For me, it is odd that no one cleaned up after their dogs. I have a dog and if I took him anywhere, I would clean up his poop. Those dog owners were inconsiderate\n\nThat being said, this is a NAH situation. This is something that should have been discussed at the door or prior to the party. Dogs have always been at the party so I can understand why they assumed they could.", "ESH - It was well within your capabilities to deny the dogs' entrance into your home, and it's common practice for dog owners to check prior to bringing their dogs anyplace.
