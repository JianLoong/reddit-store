You paid for those things, they are yours. \n\nBut I am curious about what you did specifically to get you fired. If you feel like an AH for taking your own things, it does make me feel like you are downplaying why you were let go. (no offense, I know nothing about you and just making an assumption)", "NTA, it's your stuff, you paid for it, the school is not entitled to it. Take it with you for your next class.", "Why is the School district taking this action against you?\n\nWhat ages to do teach?\n\n If middle or HS ages, what subject do you teach?", "Take everything you paid for. Do not leave a pencil behind lol", "YWBTA if you took anything that was partially resourced with school property, including posters printed with the school's printer, paper and ink, regardless if you used your own laminator and laminate sheets to enhance them. That paper and ink was taxpayer resourced. If you used an outside printing service then laminated it yourself then yes it would be wholly yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Being that the school considered your presence so problematic, I think it would be prudent to remove any \"debris\".", "NTA. I've been there before as many others have, they are your resources that you have collected with your own money and time. It is not your fault the classroom is the way it is, that is fully down to the school.", "It is an elementary school with a specialized classroom. They did not give a precise reason however, it is been an ongoing issue that one of the students will not work with any other teacher besides myself, so they wanted me to keep your distance to help that student work with others however, the student would see me in the hallway and would have behavioral issues even if I did not know, the student was in the hallway, I would still get blamed for being in the way. They even went as far as to tell the student I wasn\u2019t at the school.", "Many of these were already printed and laminated from my last classroom.", "Was the last classroom a different school? If so then you already took them so might as well bring them along. If it's the same school then they are still made with the school's property.", "Yes, I changed schools because I was commuting over an hour one way.", "Might as well take them then. They weren't made with the school's resources where you are at.", "I do recommend searching for some inner awareness why you would feel guilty about taking them from this school when you brought them in yourself from outside.", "The students are highly autistic, and any change in their scheduling or the look of where they\u2019re at can sometimes potentially cause them to have outburst.", "Is your removal confirmed permanent? Having a whole new teacher is going to be way more of a shock than posters gone on the wall. The new teacher may want to put up their own things anyway.", "My union confirmed that they cannot fire me in the middle of the school year because I have a contract that also means they cannot hire a new teacher till next year. It also helps that they have no just cause for the firing. They just said they thought I wasn\u2019t a good fit. So all they can do is wait and not renew my contract for the next school year so I\u2019ll either be put on administrative leave with all benefits for the next 11 weeks or they let me back to the school. Either way I\u2019ve been told from the beginning that this was a toxic workplace and I did not believe people till now.", "Poor kids, especially if they are autistic and subjected to the drama. Sure even autistic kids need to learn that things change and need to be dealt with, but it shouldn't be forced on them in an environment that's supposed to nurture them. I have autistic nephews and it's been a struggle for my SIL to get her most extreme spectrum child to the right school. The other child has learned to manage pretty well though.", "It is in while some autistic children. Do not like the eye contact or touch others thrive on it.", "take everything. no question. it\u2019s totally normal that leaving a classroom means taking alllll your stuff.\n\nnta!!!", "As a teacher whose been non renewed through no fault of my own: administration will often get rid of staff for a lot of reasons. Budget cuts/enrollment dropping, they have someone else they want to take your job, you didn\u2019t jump through enough hoops to make their job easier, they don\u2019t want you to get tenure, or they just plain don\u2019t like you.\n\nIn my state, if you aren\u2019t tenured, you can be let go for no reason. We\u2019re only on year long contracts that can be renewed or non renewed until we earn tenure, then we need to be fired with good cause. My first boss didn\u2019t even tell me why, he even said he was satisfied with my performance that year and talked about me working there next year days before I got terminated."]}
