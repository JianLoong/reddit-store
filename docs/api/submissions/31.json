Our server barely served us, and she refused to serve my friend. We don\u2019t know why and because of this we shortly left. After getting home my friend claimed that it was because she was Hispanic. Now my friend is Hispanic, and she was very in touch with her culture. However, she is very white passing. She has red hair, blue eyes and pale skin. I told her that we weren\u2019t even talking about anything Hispanic so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue. She kept claiming that it was because she is Hispanic, that the waitress hated her. But I keep trying to explain that the waitress was just rude in general, and did not like either of us. even if she would serve me and not serve her, she was still rude. because of how white passing my friend is and how we weren\u2019t talking about her Mexican culture at all I don\u2019t think the waitress was being racist towards her. I do think the waitress was being a dick however, not racist so I told my friend that\u2019s not racism. That\u2019s just her being a dick.

Of course her obvious conclusion would be racism and you don't get to decide that it can't be because YOU think she's completely white passing.", "YTA - Look I feel like you don't understand that sometimes while someone may look white passing they are still able to have traits and features that are very obvious; for my case my brother looks white but he has thick curly hair and a big long nose that are identifiers people have used to tell my brother is latino, and i've even had latino classmates straight from mexico be ginger and have pale fair skin but that doesn't denote any discrimination they may have faced because \"they looked kinda white.\" also lets say that the waiter wasn't racist and they're just a dick.

One's person's experience of perceived racism is not open for you to refute that it happened. The Supreme Court, for example, cannot define what is pornographic, yet everyone knows what porn is. It's the same with racism. It's on a personal level. By challenging your friend's perception and telling her it didn't happen, you not only invalidate her sense of self-worth, you are implying that her perceptions are invalid. This is one of those times when empathetic listening would be more appropriate than you trying to make a decision about the incident in question.\n\nPassing for white is a loaded topic that I won't go into here.

I am not overtly aware of micro-aggressions; even though I am trying to be more aware, I\u2019ll never be as aware as someone who has to deal with it daily. While to **you** she may be white passing she may not have been to the waitress. Even just stylist choices stand out to racists. You should have just stayed quiet genuinely rather than defend the waitress. The whole \u201cthe waitress served me but wouldn\u2019t serve her\u201d has me questioning why? Like what was the difference between you two? Both females.. one just happens to be Hispanic.

A lot of white people aren't good judges of if someone's white-passing.

Maybe it was racism and you just didn't catch on, perhaps a certain accent showed her as Latina.", "YTA. Don\u2019t tell your friend how she should feel. Regardless of her natural physical features there are also clothes/ accessories that are notoriously worn by hispanic people and people certainly judge that. Language is also a big thing, maybe someone heard her accent when she was talking to you. There\u2019s also certain mannerisms/ tone of voice characteristic of hispanic people. \n\nThe fact that you are choosing to argue with your friend about it rather than try to see it from her point of view is beyond me.

It would be silly of me to claim discrimination.  In fact it diminishes those that experience real discrimination.

By your own account she treated your friend worse. Why are you so invested in gatekeeping if your friend experiences racist discrimination or if she is too white passing to do so?

This just comes off as you shiting on someone who is supposed to be your friend because you think they are too white passing to experience racism.", "NTA... as a black woman, I hate when the race card is played at any given moment just because it can be.

My mother has only ever experienced racism when she\u2019s speaking (due to her accent). Most people dont even realize my sister isnt a caucasian american. The point is that being white passing does have an effect on how (racists) people perceive you and you\u2019re right, its very likely the waitress didnt even realize your friend was mexican. Seems like she was just a shitty waitress, and equating everything to racism does nothing to solve this issue. In fact it will just make your friend seem less credible if/when she experiences racism for real.", "Yes, it is very important for you to explain to your friend when she is experiencing racism and when she is just imagining it.

Sure. But so is the possibly that the waitress really did pick up on the fact your friend is Latina (for all we know, maybe she has a slight accent or some other indicator you didn\u2019t realize) and was being xenophobic/racist.

We tend to assume that since we don\u2019t see our friends a certain way and that we\u2019re fair in the way we treat others that the rest of the world is the same.   It\u2019s not.

It\u2019s funny that race is the only situation where people in a non-discriminated group feel comfortable telling a person in a frequently discriminated against group that they weren\u2019t discriminated against. For example, you never hear of situations where a thin person tells an overweight person that they aren\u2019t discriminated against.

But maybe I'm wrong who knows.", " Hey, artists do too. lol. Though I find it to be quite pretty and interesting. Not in a bad way, just my opinion.", "Not really. Depends on where you live. In NYC there are Hispanics from all over the place. Some are Native or Mestizo or black looking, some look like they could be Spanish or Italian. They're all Hispanic in that they're from Latin America and speak Spanish. It's not really semantics at all to say that many are white.", "Chiming in from the USA.\n\n When I say \"Hispanic\" I'm generally talking about people whose first language is Spanish, for example: my exchange son from Madrid or my foster daughter who is Mexican-American. \n\nAlso, as an aside - indigenous means different things in different places but generally means \"original\" people. There are indigenous (i.e. original) ethnicities in Spain. \n\nMy Brazilian daughter, however, differs in this. Her first language was Portuguese, second language was Spanish, third English and FOURTH Italian, and identifies as African-Latina ethnically, and now Brazilian-American since getting her green card.\n\nWhile I get that generally speaking Westerners can be frightfully oblivious - some of us aren't.\n\nAlso, we aren't all white/Caucasian. Especially in America. Because here, we pretty much date, screw and have kids with each other constantly. ;) \n\nWe're the Tinder of planet Earth. ;)", "Lol.", "You clearly said, \"I taught for 30 years.\"", ">You've changed your meaning by changing your examples. \n\nNope you've just misunderstood my example bypassing the emphasis of *different lived experiences*. The example of fireworks works because they are two people at the same event who react differently. They both experienced fireworks but only one has been in combat. My Eastern European friend and I both experience bigotry I'm not white so I can't compare. \n\nOP and their friend both had to deal with a jerk waitress. OP isn't Latina so hasn't been socialized to the idiosyncrasies that come from racial discrimination & microagressions. \n\n>It was also pretty rude to imply that the other commenter is \"chronically online\".\n\nI actually said that their thought process is chronically online. But I guess I can understand some would find that rude. I try my best to use calm rational thinking but hey I can't please everyone.", "my bad, you're right. thought it was an instance of just assuming all Hispanics are Mexican", "Someone who's the target of bigotry has vastly more insight into it than someone who doesn't stfu", "White passing or white presenting? They are two different things.", "Again, white passing isn't the same as being white.", "Yes and no. Really depends on where you are. Hispanic and Latino are technically the same thing but I made the distinction bc alot of Americans assume Hispanic only means Mexican.", "Latinos and Hispanics aren't the same thing. \n\nA Latino can be Brazilian but they wouldn't be Hispanic. This is basic knowledge.", "No. The terms are interchangeable but only for some countries. Brazil and Spain are examples of non interchangeable countries. For Mexicans either Hispanic or Latino can apply.", "No, they just have to ID you as not a member of -their- group.", "Which is why other people have pointed out that whiteness doesn't always equate to just skin color, as there are other features that are more common in one ethnicity than another. I do agree that in this case it seems unlikely the waitress knew of her heritage, but that's not what your original comment was about. Your original comment was about the difference between being white passing and being white, so that's what I commented on.", "If y'all weren't strangers I'd show a picture of my clearly Native American mother who happened to have red hair because of our Irish/European ancestry. There are racial features likes noses, lips, even cheeks that are pretty noticeably not from Europe on her and many other people with light colored hair, eyes, skin.", "In college, I met a black woman with fair skin, red hair, and blue eyes, but she did not have Caucasian features.", "My mother's family was from Mexico.  She looked like the stereotypical \"Mexican.\"  She had an auburn haired sister with gray eyes.  I've got cousins you'd swear were Irish.  You still knew from their features what their origins were generally from the nose and cheekbones.", "I've known a pale redheaded Hispanic male .... there's a difference. Basically he (was) looked Mexican but he was as pale as me (Irish descent) more freckles and red hair. He didn't necessarily look white but he definitely stood out with the Mexican crowd.\n\nA racist would be able to tell he wasn't of 100% European stock and judge that. So I can see the waitress picking up on that (or maybe even an accent or mannerisms).", "My youngest granddaughter has light green eyes and dark blonde hair, her older sister has dark brown hair and eyes. They look alike except for their obvious physical differences. We are Anishinnabe.", "Haha I guess its good you dont notice features and jump to conclusions about race. \n\nIm half black with green eyes and my skin tone has been confused for Latina. But I have the thick curly hair, my nose is a bit large, I have full lips and Im thin with long limbs. Basically I look like my dad, just quite a bit lighter and I have green eyes. If that helps explain. (I havent experienced it personally but I hear these features are looked down on in parts where racism is more rampant)\n\nThere also could be the factor of how people speak. I can usually tell if someone speaks another language fluently even if you cant hear an accent. This stuff is not enough for any reasonable person to jump to conclusions about ones origins but hate and racism only see what they want to see.", "You are missing the mark here a bit. A Spanish person is white in Europe but a Mexican is POC in the USA. American racism is peculiar in many ways. It's quite unique so to say. American racism is where the nazi's got their inspiration (look it up history is fun).", "Picture the basketball player Steph Curry and his kids - they're blonde, not red-headed and green eyed I think? But I don't think anyone would read them as anything other than Black. I had a girlfriend who was the same way, she had light brown hair and green eyes but Black people were always greeting her with a \"hey sister\" (although a lot of white people did not recognize that she is black).", ">OP and their friend both had to deal with a jerk waitress. OP isn't Latina so hasn't been socialized to the idiosyncrasies that come from racial discrimination & microagressions.\n\nTrue, and this is illustrated through your first example. It's also what we agree on. \n\nThe crux here, in my opinion, is that you have not shared an experience with your Eastern European friends of them experiencing bigotry. And I don't mean that you can share the experience of an Eastern European experiencing bigotry. I mean in the literal sense,  being in their presence while they experience bigotry. This is important because in the fireworks example you are literally sharing the experience. The interpretation of the experience is individual, but the circumstances are shared.\n\nSaid differently, you have a lived experience of fireworks (1), your friends have a lived experience of fireworks (2) and you both have a shared experience of fireworks(3). The semantics of your first example does not contain (3). \n\nAll things aside, I think this point about semantics is also what /u/G3arsguy529 is driving, or at least this is how I interpreted it.\n\nAnd to be fair, you have been pleasant and rational. Which is a whole lot more than I think we can expect from the average disagreement on Reddit, eh", "This never made sense to me. This would mean bigotry is in the eye of the beholder and not an objective fact.  That doesn't seem like a route you want to take.", "I don't want you to lose sleep over this, but even white people face bigotry.   The old tellers at banks used to make me have 2 forms of ID and a finger print on my check to cash.  My professor told the whole class that she doesn't really like men and the men always get worse grades.\n\nBigotry isn't this esoteric thing you seem to think it is.", "Passing obviously I\u2019m not Rachel Dolezal. Why would I speak up if I were *trying* to look white?", "Of course it isn't, but the literal term \"white passing\" means people believe you're white.", "They'll say Hispanic for Mexicans and Latino for everything else when in reality most Mexicans refer to themselves (at least the ones I know as a Dominican living in a very much Latino community) as Latino or Mexican. And other cultures will say Hispanic bc its easier than saying Latino and dumb people assuming you're Latin (I've had that convo so many times you would not believe it)", "Begging you on my knees to understand not everyone is from America.", "What defines if someone is Latino or Hispanic? *Or both.", "I'm white and have grey eyes and brown hair, but I also have a wide, flat nose, big lips, and curly hair (only ~2C though). I'm basically a carbon copy of one of my maternal great grandmas who immigrated to the US from an island near the coast of Africa and southwest of the southeastern part of Europe but with the coloring of my Irish and Polish dad. Ran into my second grade teacher at my high graduation and she told me that she recognized me bc of my \"distinctive facial features\" and I was like \"I have absolutely no idea how to take that\" internally", "My bestie is half indigenous. I always low-key thought she looked white until she had her son and I noticed shared features that weren't white.", "Do racist have special racial radar?", "Yeah, I kinda get what you mean. You can look at my sister and tell she's Native American with some European mixed in to give her brown curls and hazel eyes. Our features are exactly the same but I have blonde hair, eyes that are blue and green (literally a ring of blue and a ring of green), and pinkish pale skin. My partner's grandfather not only knew I was native but guessed Cherokee (honestly we aren't sure, my family assimilated to avoid the trail of tears and reservations) Thankfully he's Lakota so it was the opposite of a problem but I'm not used to people seeing it.", "I mean based on what you're describing I'd assume you're half white half black, but Op is describing a pale redhead, which is even rare across most of Europe=)", "THIS exactly.  Spanish people from Spain are considered white in the USA. But Central Americans and South Americans in the USA are generally considered people of color.", "Passing means you are actively telling people you are white you are trying to \"pass\" as white, hence passing. Dolezal was trying to pass as Black. Presenting means that you just look white and people assume that you are regardless of your actions.", "Still not the same thing. Some people can actually tell a white passing person from an actual white person.", "I thought Latino meant people from Latin America (regardless of the language spoken) whereas Hispanic just means from a Spanish speaking country (incl. Spain)", "What does that to do with anything? I know many Americans are extremely ignorant but the terms Latino and Hispanic are used worldwide.", "The country or culture you're from. Hispanic is usually geared towards Spanish speaking cultures. Latino towards Latin ones. The two can interlap but they have differences, like the countries I mentioned before. Think of it like a venn diagram.", "They usually just use their eyes.", "I have a Spanish grandma ( in heaven ) but with Irish blood. She was a redhead, had freckles and blue yellowish eyes. However, her and my mom\u2019s siblings were raised in Central America. So my family is a little all over the place. \n\nSo I get what you mean!", "That\u2019s kind of an old definition before discussion about gender and the like began. Now presenting is something you actively do and the terms are pretty much interchangeable. I refer to myself as white passing because I could present as white but I don\u2019t to everyone so I don\u2019t walk through the world being perceived as white. 9/10 other poc can tell that im not fully white. That wasnt my point tho. All im saying is that it legitimately happens to people without them trying to look white.", "From people that learned it from Americans.

They might have forgotten her but they (especially the friend) might have wronged her in the past \n\nShe\u2019s having a bad day and took something the friend said the wrong way and is now taking her problems out on them. \n\nAlmost racism like the friend thinks. \n\nThey need to inform the manager of the service they received and leave it there."]}
