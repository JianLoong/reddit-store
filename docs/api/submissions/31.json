So block them all and treat them like non-family.\n\nI speak from experience, our Uncle (Dad's brother) disliked our mother, and us (me and siblings). Reason for why they considered us beneath them is because we have black in our DNA, our family is Hispanic.  The thing is our mother's grandmother (great-grandmother) was full blood Aztec Indian from Mexico, our grandmother had the Indian features, our mother did too and some of us siblings features resemble our grandmother, siblings and I are light-skinned. However to our Uncle and cousins we are black and despised us, cousins and their children have continued with their hate to present day, our parents, Uncle and Aunt have all passed away. The ironic thing is when our paternal great- grandparents with our paternal grandparents came to the  Texas, USA from Mexico our paternal great-grandfather is listed as black, paperwork is from 1904. \n\nMy maternal grandparents came to Texas from Mexico in early 1920's, maternal grandfather had white skin and blue eyes, maternal grandmother brown eyes and black hair, native American looks.\n\nSorry for long rant, just wanted to make the point that your Aunt, Uncle and cousins will always be hateful. Go NC and remove yourself from their toxic ways, as for your Dad, he can visit them but don't allow his family back in you and your Mom's presence. We never interact with my Uncle's family at all yet they constantly insult and criticize us still, word gets back to us and all I say is that it has been years since I have seen or spoken to them, yet toxic family speaks as though it was yesterday we had seen them.", "NTA.

They definitely shouldn\u2019t be speaking to you the way they are as a result, but if I saw a post on here saying \u2018my mother said something nasty so my cousin kicked me out too for no reason, so I was rude to her over text\u2019, I imagine it would get lots of ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
