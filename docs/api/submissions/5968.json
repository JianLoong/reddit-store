I usually just say I\u2019m an analyst and divert to something else quickly, because \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it\u201d makes people even more curious. 2) I\u2019m kind of a private person generally, I don\u2019t do social media except Reddit, I keep my business to a few very close friends, and I\u2019m more of a listener than a talker out of habit. This means there\u2019s just not a lot of info about me out there compared to most people and I don\u2019t share much.\n\nOk, so my (28F) boyfriend (33M) wanted me to come to holidays with his family this year to meet everyone. For the record, he knows I can\u2019t talk about my professional life, it was a Thing at first, but he\u2019s had time to figure out that I\u2019m trustworthy. Thanksgiving went ok, except that his mother tried to give me the third degree about my life and I had to gently deflect some questions.  It bothered her a lot more than we thought, because she went on a fact-finding mission and came up with nothing.\n\nFor Christmas we were going to stay at their place for a few days. On the first day, his mom made a comment about adding me on FB and I told her I\u2019m not on socials, and she remarked on how weird that was for someone my age, and was trying to probe for why.  I finally got his dad to talk about something else, but that night I was getting a shower and I noticed when I got out that someone had tried to access my phone and failed the passcode. My phone takes a picture if the passcode is failed too many times, and it was his mom. I showed my b/f and we confronted her and she went on and on about how secretive I am and how she\u2019s just looking out for her son because I could be anyone and I\u2019m probably not even giving him my real name, maybe I\u2019m cheating, etc.\n\nI told my b/f that this wasn\u2019t acceptable and I was going to go find a hotel to ensure my privacy. He came with me and given the stream of texts we got after we decided to just go home. He\u2019s still getting texts from family about it and his dad told him that while his mom messed up with the phone, she was right to be worried because I\u2019m clearly hiding important things.\n\nI probably could be more forthcoming about some personal things, but the more someone digs and pushes, the less I want to share out of instinct. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m rudely shutting them down, but at the same time I can see how your kid dating someone with no public information footprint and who doesn\u2019t divulge a lot would be concerning.", "created_utc": 1672348146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zygivp/aita_for_being_secretive_about_my_life_towards_my/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really like my job, so I think you can understand why I am cautious about what I say.\"  I think that will shut up more people than you think.

Then proceed on how she is as a person.", "ESH. First, your boyfriend's mom is off-the-charts inappropriate. But no one has to be as secretive as you are. You are a virtual stranger coming into their home. I have no doubt but that the questions started because your bf's family just wanted to get to know you. You \"Veil of Secrecy\" thing is just really off-putting under those conditions. I won't pretend I work in national security or anything like that, but I do regularly have to sign confidentiality agreements. When people ask me what I do, I give them the broad strokes. When they ask me who I work for, I say something along the lines of, \"I'm so sorry but my contract says I'm not allowed to talk to anyone about that.\" Inevitably, people back off. Or make a joke or two, and back off. This line would serve as well for whatever line of work/government service you're in. \"What do you do?\" \"I work for the Secret Service.\" \"Oh my God, do you protect the president?\" \"I'm really sorry, I'm just not allowed to talk about it.\" That way you acknowledge people's legit interest in your life without coming off as rude or standoffish.

There are so many ways to get to know someone, and work is hardly one of them. \n\nProbably they want to brag about their son havin an -insert cool ass job here- GF.\n\nOP, his mother is sketchy as hell. Kinda hard to fully trust her after this, she burned that bridge so freaking fast lol. Good luck rebuilding it!\n\nNTA", "Yusss same! \n\nI like to ask \"what do you do for fun?\" too", "\ud83c\udfb6Nobody asks you questions when you say you're an accountant!\ud83c\udfb6", "\"I sell life insurance\".  Guaranteed conversation ender.", "Oh actually I already told you what I do, but then I had to flashy thing you so that's why you don't remember. Now, look right over here please! \n\n\ud83e\udd23", "But what if the answer is \"work\"? \ud83d\ude02", "What did people do before social media and couldn\u2019t stalk their family\u2019s partners ?", "This one is giving me the same vibes as the one with the lawyer whose mother-in-law would go into her locked office and open her files, then gossip about the cases.  I really hope this doesn't go in that direction with the bf's mother..  NTA but BF's mom certainly is.  She should trust her son's choices.   The ovaries on this woman.. trying to break into your phone!", "NTA.\n\nNo is a complete answer.", "NTA Most peoples phone have their banking, photographs, email etc on them. Whatever your work is there is no excuse for trying to go through your phone. I would have left immediately too.", "I mean, it's clear you work a government agency. Or at least somewhere that contracts for one. So do I.  You tell people \"I work for the govt, I can't talk about. Don't ask. And show your public credentials.  But still NTA", "NTA... I love privacy... I suffered an accident as a child and I'm done discussing the scars so have learned to be an expert with deflection. I dont mind the ask, but I hate the persistence, once they hit rudeness they will have consequences", "NTA. \n\nThat said, I agree with the other people who have shared that it may help to work out with your employor a backstory you can tell people. \"I can't talk about my job\" does create an allure of mystery and is only going to tempt people. It might also help you appear more social since you will have a story to share, and honestly, since you're essentially sharing a lie, you don't have to share anything actually true about yourself. \n\nI can understand a bit about where your boyfriend's family is coming from, they just want to know more about who their son is dating and that you're not a con artist or a foreign agent using him. Again, having a backstory here should help, but I do think, and I might be in the minority, that if you are together for a long time, there might come a point you'll want to not have his family at arms length. \n\nAnd I knew a girl in her 20s with no social media footprint. It's unusual, but not unheard of.", "NTA. It's not really her business. If your bf is comfortable with what you've chosen to reveal to him, that's all your ethical obligations taken care of. His family don't have a right to know anything except that he's happy, and if he tells them he is, they should take him at his word.", "NTA. I don't work for the alphabet soup anymore and Reddit is the only anti-social media account I have and ever had, even before I decided to get a clearance job. There are just people who don't dig sharing what they had for breakfast and don't give a shit about other people's fake lives. Your bf's mother is a fucking creep and no matter where you work, she has no business being up in your business.", "Info - why don\u2019t you just tell people you do some very average job, have a basic fb profile and enough generic info out there it doesn\u2019t raise suspicions? And not just cause of your crappy mother in law cause that is creepy but also for every single agency that is looking for people just like you who raise enough interest to try gain information from to use against whatever work your hiding?", "NTA. \n\nShe wanted to know more about you\u2026 why? What can she do to \u2018protect\u2019 her adult son from you? Seriously. So silly and ridiculous.", "I'm probably in the minority here but damn if someone lied to me about their job I'd be way more sketched out. How long are you going to be \"a telemarketer\" or work at the post office before someone in a close relationship to your partner thinks something is wrong? It sucks that people can't just roll with this stuff, I guess.", "\u201cI work for the State Department. Just a boring desk job. What about you?\u201d \n\nThen have a couple of pre-loaded safe-to-tell work anecdotes.", "I have done a lot of govt work and that was always my cover for whenever random people made conversation. \"I work in cellular communications for [insert random wireless company] and I'm just in town to either maintain equipment on a tower site or run coverage studies and perform noise floor testing for new/future installations\"\n\nPeople generally just leave it at that.", "How would she even begin to guess a code?  Her sons bday?", "I feel very fortunate to have married prior to social media. How ever did we get introduced to people before SM?", "That\u2019s how we did it back before internet! This SM stalking is a recent thing. Personally I love it though I\u2019m not gonna lie.", "In my father's experience, \"if I tell you what I do, you'll go to jail\" only seemed to work on very few occasions. Most of the people he used that line with seemed to hear \"Please pepper me with questions and spend the next twenty minutes making it about trust.\"\n\nBecause I'd seen his experience with that nonsense, I opted for \"I've signed so many NDA's that I can't keep them all straight, and they can afford better lawyers.\"", "Same, I'm from the DC area and it always surprises me when people get nosy about jobs. My parents and I have all worked in some classified job at one point or another and no one's really bothered us about it. Growing up, most people understood what a vague job description implied and just kept it moving bc there were MUCH more interesting topics to talk about, since like you said, work is either boring, classified, or both.", "Just say \"I'd tell you but then I would have to kill you.\". With a very straight face.", "> noise floor testing\n\nI love this.", "Good on the brother, he clearly gets it!", "I wonder if saying you can't talk about it because you signed a nondisclosure agreement would work better than saying the information is classified. Classified makes it sound like you have juicy government secrets, like you know who really assassinated a famous figure or something. \"Nondisclosure agreement\" sounds much less interesting, especially if you follow it up with it being standard policy for everyone in the company, not just like your job specifically.", "I think if you're going to work in certain types of intelligence jobs, you've got to be comfortable with a certain amount of subterfuge outside of immediate family. A response like yours is going to make some people think you're involved in organized crime.", "That one doesn't work.\n\nSource- experience.", "I've just realized there are a whole shit ton of spies in this thread, lol.", "But what do you do when they ask for help with their taxes!? \ud83d\ude02", "I told some friends about how s*x workers will tell folks that they\u2019re accountants because of that, which was then referred to as being a \u201cspicy accountant.\u201d  One of the people I was talking to really is an accountant (of the non-spicy variety) and now she snickers every time she tells people what she does.", "I almost became an accounting major instead of an economics one. I am VERY curious about what makes people continue with accountancy in their degrees. Like, what made you continue to be passionate about Reckon or, heaven forbid, Excel? How can you do the thing over and over and over and not get bored? What made you wanna do maths, but only addition and subtraction... But wait can you do predictions or am I thinking of a Finance major? So do you do regression analysis in the later years of Accounting?\n\nNow I know why nobody ever answers me.", "\u201cI work for (popular MLM scheme)\u201d would also do the trick.", "Worrying is OK, but at some point you're just going to have to trust your (adult) child's judgement. This is who they have chosen to marry and share their life with, and unless there are clear signs of abuse or very obvious red flags (someone not wanting/beong able to talk about their work is neither of these), you should respect their decisions. End of story.\n\nIf you're still concerned, the right thing to do is speak with your child in private, not ruin a family gathering by insulting your child's partner, invading their privacy, going through their phone and making things shitty and awkward for everyone.", "\"sorry, I only help with tax evasion\" then report them to the IRS.", "Cry about how much stress you\u2019re already under without their terrible record keeping skills. \n\nI-I\u2019m not speaking from personal experience or anything.", "I do corporate accounting, I even pay someone to do my own taxes.", "> now she snickers every time she tells people what she does.\n\nI love this for her, that's very funny.", "Lmao I\u2019m 1 exam from being an actuary and I call Excel my \u201ccomfort blanket\u201d", "I'm guessing it's the money. A former coworker of mine is finishing her accountancy degree and then planning to become a CPA. What I, and she previously, make is peanuts compared to it. She says it's boring as hell but she doesn't care as long as she's paid well. My grandfather was a CPA and he retired a multimillionaire. (Then it all got spent on my grandmother's long illness before she died - thanks so much, everyone who opposed single payer! thanks a bundle for that!) He was a hardworking guy but definitely middle of the road in intelligence, not any kind of genius. There aren't many career paths you can get into that pay that well for someone without any major talents or aptitudes.\n\nEdit: as for econ, you go into that and then you either live on instant ramen as a professor or else you work for a think tank and are basically paid by some political partisans for signal boosting their economic ideology. I'm guessing some people can't ethically stomach the latter. I sure wouldn't have been able to.", "Personally, I like numbers. I can hold them in my head easily and they just make sense to me. If you have all the records and enough time you can always figure out where the money went. There\u2019s always a right answer. It\u2019s very satisfying.", "My mom was a corporate accountant too, but Bitter Grocery does not math.", "There's so many degrees to get for the money that accounting is still a choice.\n\nAnd in econ there is a lot more jobs than that. I do econometrics specifically so I measure anything from wind power job availability for Indigenous communities (yes, a real research study) and greener city centre planning. My postgrad is in measuring cancer regression factors in four types of cancer. \n\nHeck even the government jobs I applied for... They wanted me working in policy expenditures for social endeavours. It was very \"cog in a machine\" not gonna lie, but nobody is paying me to change my opinion. I got a minor in Indigenous Knowledges even though I am already Indigenous but it set me up to be paid for my opinion, not against it.\n\nAfter Post grad I could get either job you mentioned but those are not my only two choices. They are, unfortunately, possible choices still. \n\nAnd that's the thing. Accounting must be a job more complex than I think as an outsider. There must be more too it that tickles your maths-brain that I am just not seeing.", "Ooooh! So is it like finding patterns as well? Seeing all those numbers fit into the perfect chart? I love that feeling!", "That's interesting, I guess... sorry for my snide comments about your profession, I'm jaded because I pretty much instantaneously loathe every economist I see on TV. But of course I shouldn't judge an entire field by the few aholes who manage to get in front of a TV camera. My own field has some of those. :P", "Ngl though those are fair comments. It's the public perception of economics and I shouldn't be defensive. There's a reason we are labelled like that and it's because - it's exists and it's fucking over real people.\n\nI got into it BECAUSE I thought the same and wanted to change it. So I shouldn't be so defensive when others see it that way.\n\nBy all means, those assholess are literally killing people and I *chose* to join that title knowing it. So nah, no apologies. I was defensive. It's a good reminder to be careful in my work, so I don't hurt any more people with it."]}
