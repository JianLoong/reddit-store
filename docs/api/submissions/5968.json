I usually just say I\u2019m an analyst and divert to something else quickly, because \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it\u201d makes people even more curious. 2) I\u2019m kind of a private person generally, I don\u2019t do social media except Reddit, I keep my business to a few very close friends, and I\u2019m more of a listener than a talker out of habit. This means there\u2019s just not a lot of info about me out there compared to most people and I don\u2019t share much.\n\nOk, so my (28F) boyfriend (33M) wanted me to come to holidays with his family this year to meet everyone. For the record, he knows I can\u2019t talk about my professional life, it was a Thing at first, but he\u2019s had time to figure out that I\u2019m trustworthy. Thanksgiving went ok, except that his mother tried to give me the third degree about my life and I had to gently deflect some questions.  It bothered her a lot more than we thought, because she went on a fact-finding mission and came up with nothing.\n\nFor Christmas we were going to stay at their place for a few days. On the first day, his mom made a comment about adding me on FB and I told her I\u2019m not on socials, and she remarked on how weird that was for someone my age, and was trying to probe for why.  I finally got his dad to talk about something else, but that night I was getting a shower and I noticed when I got out that someone had tried to access my phone and failed the passcode. My phone takes a picture if the passcode is failed too many times, and it was his mom. I showed my b/f and we confronted her and she went on and on about how secretive I am and how she\u2019s just looking out for her son because I could be anyone and I\u2019m probably not even giving him my real name, maybe I\u2019m cheating, etc.\n\nI told my b/f that this wasn\u2019t acceptable and I was going to go find a hotel to ensure my privacy. He came with me and given the stream of texts we got after we decided to just go home. He\u2019s still getting texts from family about it and his dad told him that while his mom messed up with the phone, she was right to be worried because I\u2019m clearly hiding important things.\n\nI probably could be more forthcoming about some personal things, but the more someone digs and pushes, the less I want to share out of instinct. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m rudely shutting them down, but at the same time I can see how your kid dating someone with no public information footprint and who doesn\u2019t divulge a lot would be concerning.", "created_utc": 1672348146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zygivp/aita_for_being_secretive_about_my_life_towards_my/", "score": 890, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he assured her there was nothing 'up' with you, then that should have been the end of the conversation.\n\nMy two cents, worth what you pay for it...if someone isn't satisfied with your 'analyst' answer, simply straight up tell them, \"I can't talk about my job for legal reasons, and I can be fired if I do. I really like my job, so I think you can understand why I am cautious about what I say.\"  I think that will shut up more people than you think.

Then proceed on how she is as a person.", "ESH. First, your boyfriend's mom is off-the-charts inappropriate. But no one has to be as secretive as you are. You are a virtual stranger coming into their home. I have no doubt but that the questions started because your bf's family just wanted to get to know you. You \"Veil of Secrecy\" thing is just really off-putting under those conditions. I won't pretend I work in national security or anything like that, but I do regularly have to sign confidentiality agreements. When people ask me what I do, I give them the broad strokes. When they ask me who I work for, I say something along the lines of, \"I'm so sorry but my contract says I'm not allowed to talk to anyone about that.\" Inevitably, people back off. Or make a joke or two, and back off. This line would serve as well for whatever line of work/government service you're in. \"What do you do?\" \"I work for the Secret Service.\" \"Oh my God, do you protect the president?\" \"I'm really sorry, I'm just not allowed to talk about it.\" That way you acknowledge people's legit interest in your life without coming off as rude or standoffish.
