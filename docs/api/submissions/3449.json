You're using somebody else's coffee machine, just throw the pod away! Or even put it back in the machine when you're done!

Intentional or not, leaving it on the counter cones off passive aggressive. As if you\u2019re trying to send a message of \u201cthrow these away!\u201d If he lived alone, he\u2019s presumably leave the pod in until his next cup then toss the old.

I understand they're horrible for the environment, but I have an aversion to grounds. \n\nMy roommate, instead of using pre-packaged pods decided to make her own. Sometimes she leaves coffee grounds on the counter or the used reusable pod in the sink for me to deal with.\n\nRecently, she's started to take my used pod out and just tosses it on the counter for me to clean up. On top of that, she leaves her used reusable in my Keurig. I now have to deal with her reusable pod, cleaning it out, as well as cleaning up after the one she threw on the counter. \n\nI took my expensive coffee maker away because I was tired of her disrespecting my items and my home and now she's angry with me. AITA?", "YTA - just throw away the old pods when you go to use the machine.

He would have straightened you out at that point and maybe you would still have use of HIS Keurig.  \n\nSpeak up next time so there is no misunderstanding or UNNECESSARY pettiness.", "Few things here.  \n(1) You asked for judgement on not throwing away the used pods, so yes YTA for leaving it on the counter and not throwing it away.\n\n(2) Should he have been more mature and discussed it like an adult?  Yes he should have.\n\n(3) You excuse is that \"it's not my responsibility\".  Well it's his Keurig so if he says the condition for using it is to throw his pod out then you do it.", "YTA.

Throwing away a pod does not take much effort. \nYou decided to leave trash behind and he took his keurig back.", "ESH\n\nYou're right it's not your responsibility, but it wouldn't be a big deal to throw them away.

How hard is it to just throw them in the trash?\n\nIf you leave them on the counter, they drip on the counter, and then he has to throw them in the trash and wipe down the counter.

Just leaving them on the counter can create a mess.  This song them in the trash was an, apparently, unspoken rule of use.
