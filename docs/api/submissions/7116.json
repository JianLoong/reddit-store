She mentioned how she noticed that my name is apparently \"white,\" and how she deeply empathizes with my parents and how they must have apparently chosen a white name for me so I could assimilate and avoid bullying.\n\nShe then went on a tangent about how she thinks people of color should never have to feel ashamed about their beautiful ethnic names and how it's a shame that they feel pressured by society to do so. While I agreed with her point, my name sounds American not because my parents were trying to assimilate into white culture, but because we come from a Christian community that uses Biblical names a lot. This has been the tradition for a long time, even back to when my family lived in Indonesia.\n\nI clarified and explained the reality behind my name after she finished her ideas. The group started awkwardly laughing, and she turned red and mumbled an apology for assuming. After the meeting, she texted me to say that I didn't need to embarrass her in front of the group, and now she feels discouraged from speaking up in the group again since she is usually reserved and this was one of her first times contributing. I insisted that I didn't mean to hurt her feelings but that she shouldn't have assumed things about my name and family. I feel bad for discouraging her though, AITA?\n\nEdit: I have received a lot of replies from people who are making giant assumptions about the history of my name. People are claiming that I somehow indirectly received my name through white assimilation because my Church received Christianity from white missionaries.\n\nYou are misguided. My Church received Christianity from South Indian traders in the 12th century. These traders come from the Indian Christian community that received Christianity from Saint Thomas, a Middle Eastern man. The arrogance and irony of some of you all is laughable.
