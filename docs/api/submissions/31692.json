We have been taking care of him by ourselves since neither of us have family nearby. We both work full time; she works from home and takes care of him in between tasks. She also does whatever household stuff she can in between. \n\nMy mom is a character. Her sole purpose in life is for her children. After she got divorced, she was a single mom and raised my siblings and I. We are now all grown up and I have told her that she should find hobbies outside and do other things with her church friends. She has consistently refused saying she still needs to take care of my siblings.\n\nShe recently asked if I need help with the baby (her way of feeling needed). I told her we don't need her help since we got the hang of it now, but if she wants to come to help, we will be more than glad to accept it. She responds by saying, \"why would I come if you don't need it\". Fast forward, my mom decided she wants to come visit; she can't fly alone, so my sister comes along and brings her daughter so they can go to Disney. \n\nMy mom decides that everyone should stay at our small condo because she likes having everyone under one roof. The moment she arrives, she begins commenting on things that displease her: \"your car is too small\", \"why don't you go to church?\", etc. I usually ignore these things and just attribute it to mom type things. She however, also complains about other things as well, including places we take her to eat, saying how she can make better food and the food doesn't look good. \n\nThe first night after eating dinner, I stood up and did the dishes, and my mom begins to vocalize how she feels bad I have to work all day and then have to do the dishes, and that my wife should be doing it since she is not doing anything all day.\n\nLater that week, my mom tells me about an incident where my wife makes tea for herself and doesn't offer any to my mom or my sister. My wife was in the middle of her work day and didn't think much of it. A few days later, my wife offers, and my mom responds, \"no thank you\", and then chuckles and says \"first time offering since I've been here huh\". Later that evening, after we had dinner, my sister does the dishes, and my mom begins lecturing me about how my wife should be doing the dishes since my sister cooked (we actually bought pre-made food from Costco and my sister heated it up), and that my wife is just feeding the baby to avoid doing the dishes. She continues to criticize my wife about not cooking and not doing enough and she is here visiting and shouldn't have to do this much. That's when I snapped and told her that she needs to stop complaining and if she's here to visit her grandson and enjoy, then that's what she should do. The argument went on for a little and she eventually goes to the bedroom.\n\nI felt like all I did was defend my wife, but still feel bad about yelling at my mom.

My mom thinks my wife is taking advantage of me and should do more, but I don't think so, which lead to what I believe is defendingy wife.

I mean it would have been cool to defend / stand up for her all the while. \n\nMom: \"Wife didn't ask me if I wanted tea! How rude!\" \n\nYou: \"Mom, Wife is in the middle of her work day, please allow her to do her job and make yourself some tea if you'd like some.\"\n\nMom: \"Why on earth isn't your wife doing the dishes? It's only right as she didn't cook\"\n\nYou: \"Well, you didn't really cook so much as heated up food, and Wife is feeding the baby..... like she's supposed to\"\n\netc.\n\nBut ultimately NOPE not the asshole one bit for standing up to your mom and defending your wife. This is your little nuclear family now, your household, and you and your wife get to decide how it's run -- not your mom.", "YTA, but not for yelling at your mom, for not doing it sooner.  The MOMENT she criticized your wife in her own home, you should have went ballistic on her.  Your wife and child are your immediate family now, and who you should defend.  Your mom sounds like an absolutely miserable person to be around.", "NTA - you did the right thing in defending your wife, as she did nothing wrong. And you & your wife should be allowed to live tour lives as you see fit, as you're obviously not hurting anyone, & you're living your lives in a way that works for you both. Your mom needs to learn when to keep her mouth shut.", "NTA, all spouses should defend their partner like this when they deserve defending, and your wife definitely did. Working, taking care of an infant and she still does most of the chores? Does she have a time turner or something???", "NTA. So mum has come to \"help\" but she does nothing but criticise. Your wife is working, mum is doing nothing, wife wants a tea and doesn't make mum one, but mum is here to help... Sister is washing up, mum says wife should be doing it... Your mum doesn't like your wife. She resents that you have grown up. \"her sole purpose in life is her children\"  OP, you're 38. You don't need mummy coming to help, especially when she's only trying to help you break up so she can have her little boy back. You have done ok, you have cut the apron strings, now it's time to tell her.", "NTA you did right by your wife! Your mom needed to be put in check and you did it! Don\u2019t feel bad she should. Your wife WFH and SAHM not only SAHM that is a lot of work! Your wife is a champ not lazy!", "Your mother is the asshole here. She sounds like my JNMIL. She did everything she could think of to break us up, and she came this || close. If she opens her poison trap again, show her the door. NTA. Keep up the good work, sounds like your partnership is working.", "NTA. *Clearly* not the ahole. You probably should have said something before snapping (like explain the situation first or smth) but you didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong. You basically described a very common situation between people who don\u2019t communicate well. I have a feeling she wouldn\u2019t have changed her attitude no matter what, cause those people never do, but it couldn\u2019t have hurt to try.", "NTA\n\nYou've made a fundamental mistake. Your mum isn't here to help, she's here to hlep which LOOKS like help but is actually something very different.\n\nYou'd think she'd realise how exhausting and physically demanding it is to be a new mother to a newborn. She should be proud that you're stepping up to share the load of housework so your wife can focus on looking after a small human.\n\nPerhaps your father didn't give her any help around the house when she had you, but that's no reason for her to push the same gender role expectations down to your wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You still a good son too! \nThat doesn\u2019t change because you lost your cool once with your mom. You were in a chaotic, stressful situation and you had a moment. You had that moment because you felt your wife, the mother of your son, was being attacked\u2026good for you!!!\nYour wife is both fortunate and not so fortunate by working from home. Yes she is able to be there with her child, but she is also pull double duty. I can\u2019t believe your mother can\u2019t see that! Has your mom always been critical of your wife or is this just since the baby was born because there could be a correlation between the two! \nNo you are NTA!"]}
