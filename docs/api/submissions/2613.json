I know it is probably done because she cares about me and my well being, but I sometimes need more time to process before telling everyone. \n\nI have tried to solve this by being very clear when I tell her something that I want kept private - it usually works. \n\nYour sister probably came from a good place of caring, but I really understand why it was uncomfortable for you.\n\nI hope you can get some help for the hallucinations, it sounds really scary and uncomfortable and it can be a lot of different things that can cause this - tumors, mental health etc. So I hope you will go see a doctor. \n\nThe good thing is, now that your family knows, you can hope that they will support you through this scary time \u2764", "Hey OP, I've been reading your comments and I've been exactly where you're standing right now and I'd like to tell you what happened with me. I hope you read this, even though it's a bit rambling, because I think it might really help.\n\nI started hallucinating bugs just like you about two years ago, it started with fruit flies on the ceiling in my bedroom, really minor, more annoying then anything else. I wasn't distressed, or even mildly upset by them, they were just kinda there. I didn't tell anyone because they didn't seem like a big deal, again I wasn't bothered by them so why bother telling anyone? Plus the added shame and fear that came with admitting what I knew deep down were signs of serious mental illness. I was quietly scared if I said anything I'd get locked up in a psych ward. \n\nIf someone had confronted me about it back then I would have been incredibly defensive, not just because I was scared but because, unknown to me at the time, my thoughts had already started to shift.\nLooking back now, rational me would not be cool, calm, and collected about hallucinating for no known reason, but I was back then because it's so rare that people hallucinate without some part of their thinking being affected as well. \n\nRecognising that the bugs are hallucinations is such a huge thing you've been able to do on your own. I'm assuming you found a way to figure out the difference between real bugs and fake? That's called 'reality checking' (For me it was if I squished them the hallucinations would just disappear, real ones made a mess). Reality checking is so helpful, and it might be worth trying to do some here. A lot of people are telling you it's important to go the doctor about the hallucinations, you feel it isn't and that they are all wrong. I understand probably better than most exactly where you're coming from, but it's worth asking yourself why everyone around you is thinking something different to you. You won't lose anything going to the GP or even a psychiatrist, and if you do have fears about it, I encourage you to reach out and ask questions, or bring a support person along with you if you think it will help.\n\nI'll finish by saying I wish my hallucinations stopped at bugs. But slowly, very slowly, they escalated. And they kept escalating, and I was still calm, and I was still too scared to tell anyone. They kept escalating, and so did my strange feelings, I started seeing shadow people watching me from the trees, and I started feeling like they were after me. It eventually escalated to the point where I tried to cut my leg off because I felt there was evil living inside it. Even then, when I was actively harming myself due to these thoughts and hallucinations I remember thinking how crazy it all was, and how I knew none of it was real, but I just felt it so strongly it was like I had to act on it. \n\nHallucinations don't just go away on their own, and they won't just stay benign, as much as you and I both wish they would.  Telling your sister was an incredibly brave first step, and I'm really sorry she handled it in such a dick way, but for your own sake, you need to keep reaching out.

The mother\u2019s followup (sharing the name of psychiatrists) showed concern and an effort to help OP. \n\nWhat the sister did to OP is like someone being attacked and hospitalized. While in the hospital, a condition is detected that may be treated. Does that make the attacker any less an AH? Or guilty of the attack? No, of course not. \n\nThe sister is the AH and OP is NTA.\n\neta\n\nBeing drunk is not an excuse for AH behavior. The sister messed up royally. The way she mishandled this could adversely affect how OP deals with this situation. Right now, OP likely feels attacked, humiliated, and betrayed. OP is now less likely to seek help (and this seems true based on her comments.)", "You're correct that it's serious and she needs to get it checked out but your judgement is just wrong.

It's still worth talking to a doc about it- but it's not dangerous or necessarily indicative of anything but stress. I have had this happening since childhood, as has my sister, and my father. I see bugs, people crawling through the window, people standing in the corner- once an alligator on my dresser. I'll even talk to them sometimes in my half-asleep state. Therapist assures me its harmless, and likely genetic since other family members also have it. They prescribed an allergy med called ciproheptadine, which has an off-lable use of helping control nightmares and night terrors, and it really helps. \n\nSo, worth checking out for sure, but not necessarily a sign of something super serious. Even sleep apnea can trigger night terrors and hallucinations.", "OP should get checked out, but it could easily be hypnagogic or hypnogogic hallucinations which are related to sleep issues not psychosis.

That is not normal.", "THANK YOU - I was hoping someone would mention this rather than leaping to worst conclusions", "Yeah I see bugs in my bed when I'm just waking up out of sleep, which is a hypnopompic hallucination, and sounds more like what OP is describing.

He put them on his privates for shit and giggles. Only they got stuck together and he couldn't take them off anymore.\n\nHe was so embarrased, that it took 3 days until he went to the ER. But by that point they couldn't save them anymore.\n\nThis is the situation you are in rn.\n\nWorst case its a brain tumor or shizophrenia. In that case finding it earlier than not is better.\n\nBest case, you were sleep deprived.\n\nBut you definitely don't want to ignore this.

You love her, she loves you, yeah?\n\nIf she told you she was hallucinating but didn't think it was a big deal, would you be scared for her?\n\nWhat I see in your sister's behavior is an older sister who is scared for you and didn't handle it the best way. I doubt she meant to be malicious- her inhibitions were lowered to speak her mind and what was on her mind was how worried she is.\n\nI'm worried for you. There are a lot of reasons for hallucinations, and it's likely to be something easily fixed. I know you are scared that it might be something serious, but what if it's something easily fixable that will get worse if you don't treat it now?\n\nPlease, check your carbon monoxide detectors, and make an appointment with your doctor. You could have a infection that is making you see things and you just need a course of antibiotics. That happened to me once- I got a UTI that progressed to my kidneys and made me seriously loopy and see things. I needed a few nights in the hospital, but there are no long term issues.\n\nYou are worried about being put in a box or reliant on things. I'm not going to dismiss that- it's a valid fear and something normal to struggle with. However, you are making the decision before you know what will happen- it could also be minor, or somewhat serious but temporary.\n\nHow upset would you be if your mom or sister didn't seek treatment for a small issue and it became such a big issue that they have to go into surgery or hospital? You are upset with your sister, in part, because she upset everyone with what is probably a minor issue. How much will everyone be upset if you end up in the hospital because you ignored the symptoms you are experiencing?

That said, you're downplaying something that could legitimately be a symptom of a very big problem. VERY big problem.

This is a sensitive and very personal topic and to bring it up drunkenly at the table was very hurtful I imagine. With that in mind, I do hope you seek some help. Mental health isn\u2019t something people should feel embarrassed about, and you deserve to feel safe and not afraid of waking up in the night or seeing something you\u2019re scared isn\u2019t there.

It is a big deal.", "I agree what your sister did was wrong but your the asshole for downplaying this and blowing it off. Hallucinating and scaring yourself out of sleep isn't normal. This is serious and you need to see a doctor.", "Yeah, she didn\u2019t react the best way, but you probably gave her a bit of a fright and it would have been hard for her to get that off her mind. I\u2019ve been in your sisters position and it\u2019s very scary and I felt very powerless.\n\n\nI don\u2019t really think either of you have been AHs. There\u2019s a stigma around things that could be mental, so it\u2019s common for people to be embarrassed and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d hold kicking her out against you. For you though, hallucinations can be caused by a lot of things, and because some of those are quite dangerous, it\u2019s best to always get checked out after having one (although I personally would want to rule out physical ailments first).", "It is 100% a big deal OP. You\u2019re NTA, but you need to see a mental health professional immediately. \n\nThese things do not go away in their own. They only get worse without proper treatment.

There's medication that can help you, you might be lucky and this is as far as it goes or it could escalate.\n\nI agree that you're sister is in the wrong, she wasn't trying to share the information to help you.

If life has felt particularly harder lately (relationships are more difficult, people misunderstand you more often, more drama in your life, etc), you may have more than hallucinations as symptoms.

YOU ABSOLUTE PSYCHO.", "I was bullied by my own family for being weird and difficult for almost four decades.\nTurns out I was autistic all along.\n\nI know EXACTLY how it feels.", "Thank you!!!", "No one disagreed with you on that. That still doesn't change the fact that hallucinations without drugs could be very serious Abe should be checked because neither you or OP are doctors", "Apparently you also need help due to anger management issues. I\u2019m explicitly talking about your comment that it could just be sleep paralysis (which by the way can be treated as well) and how it\u2019d be helpful for OP to clarify that information as it wouldn\u2019t be as worrisome. \n\nI said nothing to you about the sister or the way she handled it, so calm down.", "Wow its almost like OP never said they werent seeking medical help or advice and never asked for your unsolicited medical advice. You arent a fucking doctor either. Anything COULD be serious.\n\n\nANYTHING COULD BE SERIOUS. THATS NOT FUCKING USEFUL.", "I never said it WASNT serious. I simply said it COULD BE NOT SERIOUS. Amd you guys CANT HAVE SOMEONE SPREADING ANYTHING OTHER THAN FEAR. YOU MUST BE SCARED OF THE MENTAL HEALTH AT ALL TIMES. EVERYTHING IS SERIOUS. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP. SPEMD EVERY WAKING MOMENT AT THE SHRINKS OFFICE. DISREGARD THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS OFTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. DISREGARD IT ALL. GO TO THE SHRINK THE SHRINK IS GOOD FOR YOU.", "Okay, so lets break this down. Youre saying its definitely not sleep paralysis cause OP didnt specify when the hallucinations happen which definitely means they dont happen when sleep paralysis hallucinations happen. \n\nAlso i specifically call out that there are treatments for sleep paralysis. Like in my comment. I mention how the side effects from treatment cause people to stop treating. How could they have side effects fromt he treatment if there wasnt a treatment.\n\nSo youre just maling shit up, not replying in a way thats helpful to OP, just offering unsolicited medical advice, and not to OP even, but to me? Like what the fuck are you smoking? OP probably isnt even reading this. You dont get notifications when someone replies to a comment on your post. And theres already a tonne of comments.\n\nAnd youre just commenting to correct me, cause, despite the fact there are many benign sources of hallucinations when waking or sleeping, a thing that i said and you dont disagree with, cause im wrong in saying....... what exactly?\n\nThe point of OPs post wasnt to seek diagnosis from uneducated i ternet assholes. Why should OP clarify their symptoms? They didnt want your unsolicited medical advice. \n\nAnd what makes you think im angry? Im fucking typing on a screen. Im using ridiculous flowery language and cusses cause theres no consequences to my actions and its fun. Someone needs to go fucking touch grass, christ."]}
