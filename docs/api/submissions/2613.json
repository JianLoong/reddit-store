Hallucinations is one possible side effect, and if there is a chance you have a leak in your home that could explain your hallucinations.\n\nIt could be completely unrelated of course but it\u2019s worth investigating!", "INFO: why haven't you gotten professional help instead of confiding to your drunk sister?", "NAH.   Hallucinations are a sign that there is something going on in your brain that need to be monitored.  If you had tingling in your arm, youbwould go to the doctor, right?   You'd see a dentist if your tooth was hurting.   If you couldn't see properly , you would have a professional check your eyes.   A psychiatrist will work with you to figure out what's going on in your brain. It could be something small and easy to deal with, but it could also be a sign of something very serious, and potentially fatal like a tumor.  It's especially concerning as this is something that's very new to you.  \n\nPlease go see a doctor and/or psychiatrist.    I know it's embarrassing,  but your brain is just an organ like your heart or liver.   You need to look after it.", "If you're hallucinating, your sister did you a favor by disclosing it to your family. Your mother is right that you should go to a psychiatrist. \n\nOne of my extended family knew that their sibling was experiencing similar things and kept it secret until that sibling was hospitalized in the throes of a full-on psychotic episode brought on by schizophrenia.  This is serious stuff. Go see a psychiatrist. \n\nNAH", "NAH. N T A for kicking her out given how rudely she handled this, but understand that you shared something VERY concerning and she may have been unsure how to handle it, especially while drinking. She absolutely needed to tell your parents at some point. \n\nPlease do contact that psychiatrist ASAP. This could progress quickly and get scary fast.", "NAH\n\n She's probably scared as hell.You tell her this then refuse to talk about getting help.She told people because she needs assistance in getting you that help. Sorry  privacy comes second when safety is an issue. Even therapists can break onfidentiality when there is a possibility they are a danger to themselves or others,  Hallucinations are not something to be ignored. \n\nPlease get checked out.", "NTA\u2014Your sister drank too much and ran her mouth. Hopefully she learned from this experience. That said, you absolutely should a psychiatrist, even if it\u2019s just to have a professional monitor your symptoms.", "NTA, but more for *how* your sister shared the info than for sharing it full stop. \n\nDrunkenly sharing this with your friends and family at a dinner party and then blaming you for taking her classless breach of trust \u201ctoo seriously\u201d is not on. That was wrong and I understand completely why you asked her to leave.\n\nBut I also understand why your sister would want to inform your parents what\u2019s going on. She went about it in the worst way, but the fact that you\u2019re experiencing these hallucinations is concerning. If my sister told me that was happening to her and she wasn\u2019t planning on seeing a doctor about it, I\u2019d be worried. I would talk to her about it first and urge her to see a doctor, but if she made it clear she was going to try to \u201cignore it\u201d, then yeah, I\u2019d probably let my parents know. Not to entertain them with this tidbit of juicy gossip, but in the hopes that they might be more successful than me in convincing her to see a medical professional.\n\nPlease see a doctor. It could just be harmless (though obviously deeply uncomfortable to experience) hypnagogic hallucinations, but you should absolutely find out for sure. I can understand you feeling trepidation about seeing a doctor about this, but taking chances with this stuff just isn\u2019t worth it. Someone else made a great point in the comments. If you were experiencing chest pain, you\u2019d see a doctor, right? If you had anxiety or depression, would you see a therapist? The same thing applies here.", "You didn't \"make scene for nothing\". You felt there was a breach of trust. And there was. You're justified in feeling this and for acting on it.\n\nNTA for this very particular incident but keep in mind that there's a good chance your sister really didn't think it wasn't a big deal and didn't want to hurt you.

Even if she didn't know it was private, however, she trashed you further after you left the room, so you were entirely justified in removing her. And now because of her mistake your parents are pressuring you.", "I'm gonna go NAH. This is some serious stuff. I don't intend to make excuses for your sister, but she's probably been dying to tell someone for *your* wellbeing and going back and forth with herself trying to decide whether your health or her loyalty is more important. With wine added to the equation, it became a no-brainer. Your family sounds extremely supportive and clearly wants the best for you. I hope you're able to see someone about this. It's nothing to be ashamed of!", "NTA. I would advise you to seek out professional help though.", "You are 100% NTA.  What she did was wrong and cruel.  It was not helpful.  It had to feel like a huge betrayal.  I can\u2019t imagine how much that must have hurt you.  Hopefully your Austen can come to understand what her actions were and how much she hurt you.  \n\nBut you do need to get checked out.  Lots of stuff could be happening to your brain that could cause this.  You don\u2019t want to miss the early warning signs of a medical problem.  Please do get checked out.", "NTA\n\nIt does matter - she disclosed private information to her sister who then got drunk and disclosed as if it was a party trick for funsies in front of everyone.\n\nOP - as you\u2019re waking from a deep sleep to this, this sounds similar to hypnopompic hallucinations which is connected to sleeping disorders. A colleague had something like this and was referred by her doctor to a sleep clinic. Please contact your GP to investigate and also, try and get some support outside of your immediate family as my flabber is ghasted by your parents reactions", "NTA. I\u2019ve had these exact type of hallucinations caused by stress and they resolved once the stressor was gone. When and if you decide you want to access medical support is entirely up to you. I\u2019m always in favour of it, and I\u2019d suggest setting some hard limits for when you\u2019ll access help if the symptoms do continue.\n\nIf the people around you are concerned, there are appropriate ways to say this. What your family did, and what a lot of these comments are doing, adds stigma to the symptom. I feel a lot of people would be better served by having some awareness of how to respond to people who are having mental health troubles (mainly with sympathy, offering help for the support they need and being an ear for the issues they are struggling with. Not responding with shock/horror or making it about their own feelings). \n\nI sincerely hope this doesn\u2019t scare you off seeking more support!", "nta. \n\nyou are an adult and dont need to deal with her shit. \n\nur house, ur judgement. what she did crossed a boundary and u are very much in the right to demand respect... \n\ngood for u. u should talk to someone about it tho, because it could mean something", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are multiple reasons, physically and/or mentally that can be wrong. And instead of taking care of yourself when it's relatively minor. You are ignoring it till it blows up in your face. Kinda like now with your family.", "Yeah YTA. It was a mild joke that might allow for your family to properly be concerned about you until you made it scary by taking it so seriously and kicking your sister out. All of this together suggests that you do need some kind of psychiatric intervention. Are you hallucinating because of drugs? Is this new? Do you not sleep?

Please, go to a psychiatrist.", "May be serious but may be not, I\u2019d say monitor yourself and see a doctor if necessary. There are also different medical conditions that aren\u2019t mental health related that can cause hallucinations.\n\nThat said, I had something similar happen couple times, in periods when I was under huge stress. I would \u201cdream - see\u201d hand sized black spider coming down from the ceiling. The moment I jump out of bed and turned on the light I realized there\u2019s nothing there. Second time it happened I actually scared my mom, I was sleeping in a living room and she was on her way to bathroom, lights off, when I jumped off the bed and hit lamp on I startled her. I think it happened one more time and hopefully \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb not again.\n\nTake care! \ud83d\ude42"]}
