Also, your mother emailing you doctors is cold- she should have sat you down and had a conversation.\nIt IS worth speaking to a doctor but, some reassurance.\nI often wake up in the middle of a dream and for several seconds can \u201csee\u201d the things in my dreams in my room. It frequently startles me awake like you. My husband has MANY a goofy story about the random things I babble about seeing (bugs are common by the way!) before my brain clicks fully awake!\nNeither my PCP nor my therapist has ever been concerned by it, nor seen it as a sign of something more serious. \nThat said, **still mention it to your doctor for an opinion!**", "YTA and you NEED to see a Dr", "If I play too much Stardew Valley I jump out of my sleep thinking about chickens. Are the Reddit doctors going to make me an appointment too? God you guys are preachy. NTA, OP.", "This!!!!! Please Check that!!", "SCHIZOPHRENIA??? How did you get from A to Z? My symptoms are not near to schizophrenia.", "See a doctor first (I'd recommend a neurologist) if you want an accurate diagnosis, they'll refer you to a psychiatrist if needed. It sounds to me like could be sleep paralysis or something similar given the times and type of hallucination (visual hallucinations are uncommon in schizophrenia though not impossible) and you want those things checked first before you go down the psych route, and especially outpatient psych is unlikely to think first of other possibilities in my experience.", "Agree about everything except judgment.\n\nHer sister decided to tell this to everyone while drunk and said she was crazy. This is disrespecting and not a way to approach if you truly are concerned. So, to me, NTA", "I mostly agree with your reasoning but disagree with the judgement. The disclosure might be beneficial to OP to take it serious, on the other hand that's a personal health matter and especially since the outing was not made with concern for OP's wellbeing in mind.\n\nEspecially since those were family and friends, so you might not be comfortable with disclosing everything to everyone, add the part of \"OP is going crazy\" that's one of the reasons mental health issues are still more of a \"hush\" thing. She should have spoken to OP in private and potentially with a trusted person like the mother if that doesn't work, since that's less likely to activate a defensive reaction to everyone either judging you or applying pressure.", "I'm just saying that I've heard schizophrenia can develop around age 20, so this definitely needs to be addressed soon.", "Sis got drunk and joked about it. It's not like she had a private conversation with the mom and voiced her worry, she literally blurted it out in front of everyone. \n\nThat said, OP should definitely act on this and check with a professional!", "Having a drunken rant and laughing doesn't seem like she's 'scared as hell.'", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. But, I think the issue I have is that I don\u2019t want to find out what is wrong if it is of great multitude. As i feel it will put me in a box or reliant on things.", "I haven\u2019t been dreaming it, I\u2019ve been seeing it in broad daylight. I am not on any medication & never have been. I\u2019ve suffered from ptsd for about nearly four years because of childhood abuse and I\u2019ve been going through a depressive period so that may what is causing my brain to play tricks on me.", "Hallucinations are in fact a symptom of schizophrenia. The fact that the hallucinations have been getting worse over the period of a year is concerning.", "Schizophrenia doesn\u2019t go straight from 0 to 100, it starts with small hallucinations like yours and denial (usually around the age of 20) before developing into full blown schizophrenia. So yeah, your symptoms are not near full blown schizophrenia right now, but they might develop into schizophrenia without medical intervention.", "Your symptoms are canonical for schizophrenia. The most well known symptom is hallucinations, which tend to start mild and gradually build up over time, often starting in the late teens through late twenties.", "My dudette, I assure that hallucinations of ANY kind are not a minuscule issue in any way, shape or form. If this is somehow \"normal\" for you then you REALLY need to get checked as it points to some kind of long term condition.", "A year? And it is getting worse?\nIt will NOT fade. What is happening is that it is worsening.\nBad things will happen. You might be driving when they do.\nTake care of yourself and the others around you.\nGo see a damn doctor.\n\n\nI mean, at this point, given how dismissive you are of everyone very serious concerns, you are the AH.", "I think people tend to forget that the brain is also an organ. It can get sick/hurt just like a lung can. It's just different kinds of sick can happen to the brain.", "It sounds like your hallucinations are getting worse, not fading. You\u2019re NTA, but please take care of yourself. If you go to a doctor and they tell you to take a walk, like you suggested in another comment, go to a different doctor. Please consider getting involved in seeing/hearing mad communities or psychiatry/psychology before your hallucinations continue to get worse.", "OP you are admitting that this has gotten worse over the past year. Why do you assume it will fade and not continue to get worse like it already has???\n\nYour sister was wrong to out something you said in confidence. But you still should go see a professional about this. If only so they can tell you it is not a big deal as well, right?", "Jesus f\\*ck this is serious. As in *serious* serious. Brain tumour kind of serious. Get yourself checked NOW.", "It was really terrible.\n\nYes, you should go to the doctor. But its up to you to decide with whom you want to share that information. I am so sorry that your sister behaved like that.\n\nMassive NTA", "It IS big, OP.\nHallucinations without the use of hallucinogenic drugs are a pretty fucking serious thing.\nYes, she was an AH in the way she disclosed it but do not dismiss your symptoms.", "Your sister can be an AH and this can be serious at the same time. Just think of it this way, go to 1 doctors appointment and if they say it's not serious, then you don't have to do it again. At least do it for peace of mind. But hallucinating things is never a good sign.", " Bigger than it was, or bigger than you want it to be. Because they\u2019re very different things, and non drug assisted hallucinations are a sign that something in your brain is very wrong.", "Needing to be reliant on something is completely distinct from knowing that fact. The doctor can't change your reality. It is what it is. Your fear is working against you here. Do the responsible thing and go to a doctor.", "It may not even be a psychiatric thing, but another completely unrelated health issue, or maybe nothing at all. But if this is something you've been experiencing for a year and has recently escalated, it's absolutely worth speaking to a doctor about. A fear of it being serious is valid for sure, and if by chance it is, the sooner it's addressed the better. \n\nYour sister was definitely an AH for disclosing it the way she did though.", "Talk to your doctor first, it can be all manner of physical things causing them and not mental health. If someone mentioned to me that I might have any of the mental health diagnosis thrown around here I would be feeling pretty scared and reluctant.", "Yeah, this could be connected. Girl, it won't hurt to get it checked though, just to be sure.", "You're hallucinating things without the use of hallucinogenic substances. That is VERY serious, it's not a scrape on your knee, you can't fix it with a plaster. This is your brain creating images that aren't there. In fact I fucking challenge you to name me one illness that causes hallucinations that isn't that serious or would get much worse without treatment.\n\nI'm serious, if you don't think it's that serious name me one mental illness that causes hallucinations that isn't serious. Because off the top of my head I can name several, and every single one is very serious.", "You\u2019re at the prime age for schizophrenia to rear it\u2019s head. GO SEE A DOCTOR!", "It might not be, in fact I really hope it isn\u2019t but it\u2019s definitely something that requires assessment. It could be a sign of physical health issues like exposure to harmful substances or damage to your brain like tumours etc. it could be something psychological which may stay the same but may get worse or it could just be your body reacting to a lot of stress and even that can be serious for your long term health. Your sister sucks for making fun of you and for sharing it the way she did, you have every right to be upset and to have asked her to leave. That doesn\u2019t erase the fact that this is potentially the early signs of something very serious.", "Yes but if I find out, what then?", "Then you have a way to treat it, you learn ways to handle it. Knowledge is power. I know it can be terrifying to get a diagnosis (for whatever it is, it can also be something minor), but waiting and trying to ignore it doesn't make it better, in fact it's going to make it worse. Don't be scared to see a professional.\n\nThink of the future you and how happy she will be that you tackle this now."]}
