If my sister told me that was happening to her and she wasn\u2019t planning on seeing a doctor about it, I\u2019d be worried.

I hope you read this, even though it's a bit rambling, because I think it might really help.\n\nI started hallucinating bugs just like you about two years ago, it started with fruit flies on the ceiling in my bedroom, really minor, more annoying then anything else. I wasn't distressed, or even mildly upset by them, they were just kinda there. I didn't tell anyone because they didn't seem like a big deal, again I wasn't bothered by them so why bother telling anyone? Plus the added shame and fear that came with admitting what I knew deep down were signs of serious mental illness. I was quietly scared if I said anything I'd get locked up in a psych ward. \n\nIf someone had confronted me about it back then I would have been incredibly defensive, not just because I was scared but because, unknown to me at the time, my thoughts had already started to shift.\nLooking back now, rational me would not be cool, calm, and collected about hallucinating for no known reason, but I was back then because it's so rare that people hallucinate without some part of their thinking being affected as well. \n\nRecognising that the bugs are hallucinations is such a huge thing you've been able to do on your own. I'm assuming you found a way to figure out the difference between real bugs and fake? That's called 'reality checking' (For me it was if I squished them the hallucinations would just disappear, real ones made a mess). Reality checking is so helpful, and it might be worth trying to do some here. A lot of people are telling you it's important to go the doctor about the hallucinations, you feel it isn't and that they are all wrong. I understand probably better than most exactly where you're coming from, but it's worth asking yourself why everyone around you is thinking something different to you. You won't lose anything going to the GP or even a psychiatrist, and if you do have fears about it, I encourage you to reach out and ask questions, or bring a support person along with you if you think it will help.\n\nI'll finish by saying I wish my hallucinations stopped at bugs. But slowly, very slowly, they escalated. And they kept escalating, and I was still calm, and I was still too scared to tell anyone. They kept escalating, and so did my strange feelings, I started seeing shadow people watching me from the trees, and I started feeling like they were after me. It eventually escalated to the point where I tried to cut my leg off because I felt there was evil living inside it. Even then, when I was actively harming myself due to these thoughts and hallucinations I remember thinking how crazy it all was, and how I knew none of it was real, but I just felt it so strongly it was like I had to act on it. \n\nHallucinations don't just go away on their own, and they won't just stay benign, as much as you and I both wish they would.  Telling your sister was an incredibly brave first step, and I'm really sorry she handled it in such a dick way, but for your own sake, you need to keep reaching out.
