Again, I've had so many procedures done over the years so I've gotten pretty tough emotionally.  I know I don't need my partner to come with me, but I still told him what the doctor said.

I'm sure that's news to her. Maybe she can bring it up to her therapist during their next session?\n\nPeople in this comment section are being such heels and I really feel for her.", "Ooook I think I misunderstood a little bit.  \nBut my question kinda still stands. Do you think your husband would still drive you if you told him the doctor said you can drive?", "you\u2019re absolutely not an asshole for being afraid of a medical procedure!! what is not okay is telling any level of lie. based on your comments your husband would\u2019ve been there for you either way-you should\u2019ve just been honest with him and said that you should be fine to drive, but want him there in case you react poorly as you have a history of doing so. the lie is inexcusable-you just needed to be honest with him.", "Her whole pregnancy is going to be very difficult for her psychologically. I guess I just find it mind-boggling that knowing she is terrified of pregnancy, she would pay tens of thousands of dollars to undergo fertility treatments or that she claims to pass out at the slightest of pain, yet apparently thinks childbirth will be nothing. Add to it that she thinks it is acceptable to lie to her husband and it's like a car accident... you don't want to watch, you know you shouldn't watch, yet you can't turn away.", "Well, yes, but she's tokophobic, passes out at the slightest of pain, and is having trouble getting pregnant naturally. All of that would tell me that she should consider adoption or surrogacy, but not continuing with fertility treatments.", "Yes, I too have experience in all of that and it sucks. But OP is not asking but lying for support for a procedure that is uncomfortable for seconds. If OP wants to have a family, let alone function as an adult, they need to get some help if they are going to be have this much level of anxiety about medical procedures. Pulling their husband out of work for hours for this medical test is unfair.", "I have. I'm tokophobic. I've talked to therapists, I've desensitized myself. haven't tried a doula..This whole thing is hard.", "So OP wants emotional support? As I said, they need to address this instead of lies and manipulation. What a great way to start a family, let alone handle their relationship!", "Yes I think he would.", "She knows all of this and has decided to take this path. It\u2019s nothing to do with any of us."]}
