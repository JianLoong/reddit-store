Again, I've had so many procedures done over the years so I've gotten pretty tough emotionally.  I know I don't need my partner to come with me, but I still told him what the doctor said.

Though I did not pass out, the pain was severe enough that I was nauseous for quite some time and it is the only medical procedure that I have actually taken time to sit up when they tell you \"you can sit up when you are ready, just take your time.\" I have a high pain tolerance and I took 800mg of advil before the appointment. The dr talked me through the entire thing and worked as quickly as possible, giving me warnings for when to expect the pain. It was still god awful.

The least he could do is go to the appointments and hold your hand for the really shitty parts and the HSG might be IMO, one of the MOST shitty parts.

If he can't give it to you and you find yourself having to lie to him so that he will take you seriously or give you support that should be freely given then I'd have some doubts about whether this relationship will last and whether parenting together is going to be in the cards for the two of you. But for wanting your husband to be there to offer support and comfort during the HSG? No, you are not an asshole for that. You are not an asshole for thinking that this fertility journey is something you would do together. You are not the asshole for wanting him to be an active participant, attend the appointments, ask questions, help you with injections and ordering meds, etc. Do not listen to these people describe it as a minor procedure.
