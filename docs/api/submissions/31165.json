My heart wasn\u2019t in it, but I felt it was the decent thing. \nHer place and animals were infested with fleas. It smelled bad. It was gross. \n\nHer kids barely communicated with me - I mean, maybe three texts maximum. \nHer kids came after about two weeks but only stayed two days. They wouldn\u2019t stay in her home because of the fleas. \n\nOne night I was reaching into the cupboard to get dog food and I moved a bag and a smell about knocked me down. I pulled my hand out and it was wet. I had stuck it in a decaying animal, I guess a rat. There were maggots and it was disgusting. \n\nBy that time, she could talk pretty well (but it took time to get the words out) and understand, but her short term memory was bad. \nSo I explained the conditions in her house. She just said I was over sensitive and over reacting but two minutes later she would say she needed to get a cleaning crew. \n\nI really didn\u2019t think she would be discharged back home to live alone, but nurses and PT people have been in and out of there every day. I\u2019ve been taking her to her appointments, going to the store for her, pharmacy, etc etc. \n\nShe\u2019s said some offensive, passive aggressive stuff (that didn\u2019t even make sense) - petty stuff about how I live, but that is how she is and it\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t like her or consider her a friend. \n\nBut now I am fed up. \nI never asked for a dime to help out.

You tried to be a good kind person but she and her family don't appreciate it and now she's blaming you for the fleas.  Tell her you're done but if she starts giving you a guilt trip, walk out.  You owe her nothing and this is such poor behavior that you must free yourself from the toxic atmosphere.  It's bad enough when you have to do this stuff for family, but this is.... beyond the pale.", " I can't believe she was not released to at least a skilled nursing center rather than her home.  I would Google senior support services in your area and call them.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t your problem. It sucks for her, sure, but that responsibility doesn\u2019t fall on your because you happen to live next door.", "NTA.  Let her kids know you can no longer care for her and they need to seek an alternative.", "NTA, you have been very generous already. It's not your responsibility to continue doing more for this woman, but I just want to say that her rudeness and non-sensical accusations are likely because of cognitive decline. Either she isn't fully understanding reality, easily forgetting what has happened, or has much much lower impulse control resulting in disproportionate reactions. It happens to everyone as we age, but of course to a greater extent in people who have had brain injuries. I used to look after an elderly lady (also with a brain injury) who was so sweet and then if we walked a little too briskly and her blood pressure went up she would become quite aggressive and rude. I was always amazed at how quickly her demeanour changed back to normal after just sitting down for a few moments and having some water. Just saying all of this so that it's easier for you not to hold too much anger towards her at how she might be treating you despite all you've done for her and that she is likely at the mercy of her old age and injury. But again, NTA and not your job to continue helping her, it is a huge ask of anyone particularly someone with no relation.", "NTA, you went above and beyond, only to have her turn on you and crap.  Call her children and tell them to get their butt down here to look after her and the animals.  Also call a government agency and let them know the state of her home.  Call the SPCA and get those animals the proper help they need.  Then wash your hands of the whole ordeal.  You are a very kind person, the world needs more people like you.", "NTA. You are a hero in my book. Just the sort of person I would like to call friend.  So you jumped in an emergency and that emergency is over. She has a support team and they need to take over.  Thank you for your great kindness to your neighbor.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been very kind. You should call a local agency (board of health, for example) and make a report that she needs assistance and lives in an unsafe environment.", "NTA. It's understandable that you're fed up with the situation. You've already gone above and beyond to help your neighbor, but it's not fair for her to accuse you of bringing fleas into her house. Taking care of her animals and assisting with her appointments is a kind gesture, but it shouldn't come at the expense of being treated poorly. Prioritizing your own mental wellbeing is important too.", "NTA! You went so above and beyond what neighbors do.  You cannot take over for her kids who didn't hire someone to clean the infestation and hire people for the animals if they couldn't. \nYour \"job\" now is to call whichever child picks up first and tell then you can no longer assist their mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've been more than accommodating.\nHer children know the condition of her home, yet they chose to ignore it, and wouldn't even stay there. What's that tell you?  You're a wonderful person \u263a\ufe0f but, it's time to step away. Not your problem anymore. It's very simple... You're done.\nEnd of communication.. no texts from her kids..\nAbsolutely time to cut it off. Let her hire people or go and live with one of her kids. Live with no regrets.", "You've gone far above and beyond already in terms of helping her out.

Give them her children\u2019s contact info.  You\u2019ve done enough.  Bless you for being a good human.", "NTA you need to call adult protective services and tell them what you put here.", "NTA.  Wow, wouldn't it be great if all neighbors were as kind and helpful in a tight as you have been.  I'd say the tight is over and now you are dealing with lifestyle.  It is NOT your place to feel responsible for her lifestyle.  That said, I suspect she has some cognitive issues and, if I were you, I'd report your concerns to adult protective services and her adult children.  Hopefully someone will see she gets the support she needs.\n\nJust let her know that you won't be \"on-call\" in the future as you have personal matters of your own that need your attention.  Let her know that you're asking her children and adult protective services to contact her to work out what she needs.  If she has animals that are being neglected, contact local authorities about that too.  She may be mad at you for some or all of this, but it is the right thing to do for yourself and for her.\n\nThanks again for being a stand-up human being!", "YWNBTA.\n\nIt's OK to set boundaries and say no.\n\nThere may be services in your area that can help arrange transportation for your neighbor at low or no cost due to her age.  Your neighbor, or her children, can reach out to a local agency that helps seniors with these kinds of things.  Also, the nurses and therapists should be able to make referrals or get a social worker involved to help.\n\nAlso, any healthcare workers would be the ones to report any issues with your neighbor's living conditions.\n\nYou have gone above and beyond for someone that isn't a close friend.  Step away with a clear conscience.", "Nta\n\nYou went above and beyond already. \n\nIf she needs a caretaker, then she can get one, it sounds like she has enough of her faculties to get that in motion. If she can't, then maybe her kids can line one up for her. You should call them and tell them that she needs help, and you can't provide it anymore. Let them take it from there.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go no contact, and block her number.", "NTA. \n\nIf she is good enough to accuse you about those stuff, she is good enough to pick a phone and call for help from other people. \n\nYou did more than enough. I wouldnt be that good of a neighbor, honestly.", "NTA. You\u2019ve done more than most people would have, and under terrible conditions. Simply call adult protective services. Let them know that you have no connection to this woman and are the only person looking in on her. Make it very clear that you are no longer available to do that and you think she will suffer or die without assistance. AFTER you make that call, text the family numbers you have and let them know you made the report and are long available to care for THEIR mother. Once you see or hear that APS has shown up, you are done and will have nothing to feel bad about.", "She went to a rehab place for about ten days. Sorry I didn\u2019t include that. To me it was just another kind of hospital.", "Please call adult protective services, and possibly the Humane Society.", "NYA. It sounds like she may need adult protective services if she can't care for herself and her children don't step up."]}
