Either way, regardless of if it's words or physical, she should make a point to try to understand where your're coming from and apologize for making you feel the way that she did.  \n\n\nYTA because you're not being straight with her about your boundaries. Don't hint, state facts. And if she continues to disrespect your physical boundaries, then it's time to move on. As for being the DD, I'm not sure where you live or if there are taxis/ubers readily available, which, you could have thrown some money down on the table and told her find her way home. Or, if there aren't easy ways to get home, you could have left the bar and told her to call you when she was ready to be picked up - just to keep your promise.

It would help, but you are also right it would take a few years to get to the point of it mattering.\n\nWas more just me teasing and spreading the gospel of BJJ lol", "I do traditional Japanese jujutsu.
