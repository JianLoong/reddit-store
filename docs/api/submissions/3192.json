What a bunch of AHs these people are.", "NTA you should\u2019ve taken your dessert back too", "Nta, that was super rude for them not to wait or at least save you a plate.  I would of left too!", "I'm going with ESH because you left dinner for 40 minutes to get weed. That was an AH thing to do. You said you were starving so why didn't you prioritize eating over smoking? If I invited somebody to dinner and they ditched out for a pot run right before we ate I'd be pretty offended. You know how much work went into making that food, you were there. That being said, your friends also know how much work you put into helping so they could have saved you a plate. This doesn't sound like the classiest group of people tbh.", "NTA and I'm not ashamed to say I'd have cussed out these so-called friends to high heaven. I dunno why you had to get weed before dinner if you were so hungry though.", "NTA, and you\u2019re smart to not drink on an empty stomach that shit fucks you up and makes you feel like you\u2019re dying", "YTA for leaving when the food was ready to buy drugs and expect people to know what your intentions were. You are in your 30s. Take some responsibility.", "I would say nta, at least initially. Did you and your friend check how long before dinner was going to be served before leaving for the 40 minutes? Even with a small dinner, it would likely take a bit to wipe it out and that might have help prevent the situation. Snowing to think about for any future gatherings.\n\nYour friend should have still made up as plate for you. Sorry your Thanksgiving sucked", "ESH. They suck for eating all the food, but as hungry and you claim you were you still spent 40 minutes going to get drugs instead of eating. So, really what was more important to you?", "That's super rude not save a plate for a guest who you MADE contribute to dinner. wtf. This might actually be my mom's cardinal rule, like it might be the sole reason she would disown me. It's that frowned upon in my family. So I'm flabbergasted.   \nNTA no way you are the asshole.", "ESH. The other people could\u2019ve left you a plate, but they may not have thought you were that hungry if you left just before dinner. You knew the food was ready and everyone would be eating shortly, but you still decided to leave. Everyone else shouldn\u2019t have to wait to eat until you get back from your 40 minute trip. You made a poor decision. Weed could\u2019ve waited until after dinner.", "ESH you left when the food was done for 40 minutes, that was dumb. They ate all the food in less than an hour, that was rude.", "NTA.", "Definitely NTA. Can't say the same for anyone else involved. Just bad host/essing.", "ESH.  You claim you're broke enough to not have food money.  But you had weed money?  And you didn't get the idea earlier to buy it?  Obviously a plate should have beeb made for you but so much of this is sucky on your end too.", "You're in your 30s and left at dinner time to score weed. If you were hungry you could've just ate. YTA.", "Why would you leave when the food was just finished? Seems like a stupid move. But also sucks that your friend didn't even save you a plate, but saved one for the host. And I'm guessing the host didn't even offer to split their plate with you after realizing what happened. \n\nESH", "they're the assholes for not saving you a plate. you're an idiot for leaving right before dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My friend(the host) ask if I wouldn't mind walking with her. Since she knows I walk alot. Plus with her car out of gas, and her spouse cooking, she wanted company for thr journey.", "It's hard to tell because everyone is referred to as \"my friend\" and there are multiple friends at said event. It wasn't clear which friend is hosting. If he did go with the host then NTA.", "Sorry for the broken english. What I asked is, did you buy your own weed? Because you shouldn\u2019t prioritize weed over food in your stomach. Even if you\u2019re not buying, maybe arrange your priorities. Also, find better friends with better family members.", "NTA. You specified that you went with your friend who was hosting the event, after being asked by her to join. It sounds like the friend in question is a young woman who very reasonably doesn\u2019t want to walk to pick up weed by herself. It was rude for the people there to eat without the host present at all. It also says you provided a dessert, and they also should\u2019ve never eaten when people who contributed towards the dinner aren\u2019t present. \nI see a lot of people in here with a stick up their ass though. Pretty condescending and extreme to call it \u201cdrugs\u201d , when OP specified it was just weed. Also to the people telling OP to check his priorities, I respect him for accompanying his friend who was going out alone. I see a lot of commenters here who are on a serious high horse.", "NTA, but why leave when the food is done? Is this some american thing, isnt that the time to eat rather than later? Why not buy weed earlier/later?\n\nThis makes no sense OP. I need an answer!", "Eh esh. They should've saved y'all plates but also you left for 40 minutes in the middle of Thanksgiving to smoke weed. \n\nYou couldve just ran by a gas station (some are open Thanksgiving), and grabbed a hot dog or something. Don't tell me you can't afford a hotdog when you buying weed dude. Beggars ain't choosers.", "NTA - and none of these people, including the host, are your friends.\n\nShe asked you to leave as soon as the food is done. That is extremely weird behavior, especially considering that it's a significant holiday and even if the shops close at 6:00, going without cannabis isn't going to kill anybody.\n\nBut given that you said she is limited on budget and you guys had to walk because she didn't even have money for gas in her car, it's starting to feel like this might have been at least somewhat planned or just generally accepted. No one in her family had money for food, but they could dupe you into providing some and then she took you out literally as soon as it was done. The host's husband was also aware that you didn't eat, so his behavior is also completely unacceptable. There's more going on than just \"oopsie, we ate all the food!\"", "Because the host asked him because she didn\u2019t want to get it alone??", "He was just trying to not be rude to the host! She is the one who asked him to accompany him because she didn\u2019t want to get the weed alone", "The edit clarifies it", "Wild this one is skewing Y T A. People on this sub or the worst lol. You helped make all the food and then strangers (to you) show up and eat everything while the host her self is gone?\n\nThat's barbaric behavior. I would have left as well, and the friend giving you shit for leaving is to. But they were probably embarrassed by her family that have the manners of untrained dogs.\n\nNTA. Never see these people again. Also stay of this sub evidently ... Jesus.", "Why didn't the spouse stop the family from eating the food? Is he incapable of saying no?", "Absolutely NTA with those edits. If your friend is angry with you I think you need to be honest with her that you spent the last of your money on dessert and literally hadn't eaten. Her family stole food out of your mouth and you couldn't cope.", "You went with the host and then some other people showed up and ate all the food? \n\nThat's dreadful.", "NTA\n\nI'd have replied. 'I LEFT FOR FOOD!'", "I would have taken the dessert you bought home with you.\n\nIf anyone said anything I would have just said, I was invited and asked to bring a dessert, I had nothing to eat so I'm having MY dessert myself.\n\nNTA", "You willing left the party to go get drugs with your friend instead of staying and sharing a meal.\n\nYTA and so is your friend. \n\nYour friends family shouldn't have to sit around waiting for you two to get back before eating.", "This definitely aligns. I agree, definitely suspect. They invited him, but while they were making dinner probably realized they didn't have enough. Either way, the hosts were not hosts. This is pretty carp. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude14", "There was an add in the 70s for basic reading skills with the line \u201creading is fundamental.\u201d It\u2019s still true. Read the post.
