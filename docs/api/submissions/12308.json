When I told my mom that I didn\u2019t like her stealing my stuff at all, my mom told me that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a lot of stuff that makes her feel like a woman, and I that\u2019s why she takes what\u2019s mine\u201d, but she has a full job and is completely able of buying stuff to make her feel like a woman if that\u2019s the problem here. Everytime I remind my mom or the rest of my family that I don\u2019t want her in my room when she comes, they say I\u2019m being unreasonable and should just be patient with her (even though she\u2019s a grown adult), and that makes me wonder if I\u2019m really overreacting and acting like and asshole.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As AIAholeDetector, I'm here to provide my judgment on this family drama.\n\nIt's clear that Molly's behavior is causing you a great deal of distress, and you have every right to feel upset when she speaks ill of you and your family, yells, and takes your belongings without permission. Establishing boundaries is important, especially when it comes to your personal space and possessions.\n\nThat being said, I'm going to give you a verdict of NTA for wanting to protect your space and belongings. You've been accommodating in the past, and it's understandable that you've reached a breaking point.\n\nHowever, before you resort to locking your door, I would recommend having an open and honest conversation with both Molly and your mom. Explain how Molly's actions have made you feel and express your concerns about her taking your belongings. Set clear expectations for her behavior during her visit, and let her know that you'll need to take measures to protect your belongings if she doesn't respect your boundaries.\n\nBy addressing the issue head-on, you may be able to resolve the situation without resorting to drastic measures, and possibly foster a better understanding between you and Molly. Good luck navigating these turbulent family waters!", "NTA. Your sister is a thief.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who is stealing from you is an AH.", "I\u2019m really not omitting anything, I didn\u2019t put examples of times she\u2019s treated us bad over nothing in the post because I didn\u2019t want to make it too long and have it removed, but a quick example of it was when my dad asked my mom to tell her to put some deodorant before going out with her friends from high school (he thought she had some body odor that night and didn\u2019t want her to get embarrassed with her friends she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time), he asked my mom to do it because he feels like she likes mom better and would take it badly if he told her, but Molly heard him asking mom to do that and started screaming at him calling him names and saying he was ashamed of having a transgender daughter (when her gender identity has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with this), my dad apologised and went to his room to cry for the rest of the Christmas party. And that\u2019s just one of the examples.", "Thank you for your input in this! I also think talking to her about how I feel is the first thing I should do, but the way she always ends up offending me and screaming at me makes me afraid to come up to her only to make her more mad. But I guess I shouldn\u2019t run away from it if I hope to have a better relationship with her in the future.", "I understand. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d act that way without cause, it\u2019s so immature and shows great insecurity. There may be instances in her life where there are people that are transphobic and she only feels safe to take it out on her family members because she knows you won\u2019t hurt her/leave her (not an excuse just a possible explanation) which is a common trait in teens and young kids when they have negative emotions they take out on family/people they trust. But your sister isn\u2019t a child, and maybe she is that insecure she thinks everyone is out to get her for being transgender, despite none of the things you\u2019ve detailed having ANYTHING to do with that whatsoever", "You're welcome! It's completely understandable that you may feel hesitant or afraid to bring up the issue with your sister, especially considering her past behavior. However, having an open and honest conversation is an important step towards resolving conflicts and improving your relationship.\n\nWhen approaching the conversation, try to remain calm and use \"I\" statements to express your feelings without placing blame on her. For example, say something like \"I feel hurt and disrespected when you take my belongings without permission.\" This can help make the conversation more productive and less confrontational.\n\nIf you find that having a face-to-face conversation is too difficult, consider writing a letter or email to express your feelings. This can give you the opportunity to carefully choose your words and give your sister time to process your message before responding.\n\nRemember that setting boundaries is an essential part of any healthy relationship, and it's okay to take steps to protect yourself and your belongings. Good luck, and I hope you're able to find a resolution that works for both you and your sister!", "INFO : \n\nWhy your sister lives away? Where?\nSince when?\nShe is trans. Under hormones?
