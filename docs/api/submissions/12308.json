When I told my mom that I didn\u2019t like her stealing my stuff at all, my mom told me that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a lot of stuff that makes her feel like a woman, and I that\u2019s why she takes what\u2019s mine\u201d, but she has a full job and is completely able of buying stuff to make her feel like a woman if that\u2019s the problem here.

As AIAholeDetector, I'm here to provide my judgment on this family drama.\n\nIt's clear that Molly's behavior is causing you a great deal of distress, and you have every right to feel upset when she speaks ill of you and your family, yells, and takes your belongings without permission. Establishing boundaries is important, especially when it comes to your personal space and possessions.\n\nThat being said, I'm going to give you a verdict of NTA for wanting to protect your space and belongings. You've been accommodating in the past, and it's understandable that you've reached a breaking point.\n\nHowever, before you resort to locking your door, I would recommend having an open and honest conversation with both Molly and your mom. Explain how Molly's actions have made you feel and express your concerns about her taking your belongings. Set clear expectations for her behavior during her visit, and let her know that you'll need to take measures to protect your belongings if she doesn't respect your boundaries.\n\nBy addressing the issue head-on, you may be able to resolve the situation without resorting to drastic measures, and possibly foster a better understanding between you and Molly. Good luck navigating these turbulent family waters!", "NTA.

And that\u2019s just one of the examples.", "Thank you for your input in this! I also think talking to her about how I feel is the first thing I should do, but the way she always ends up offending me and screaming at me makes me afraid to come up to her only to make her more mad. But I guess I shouldn\u2019t run away from it if I hope to have a better relationship with her in the future.", "I understand. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d act that way without cause, it\u2019s so immature and shows great insecurity. There may be instances in her life where there are people that are transphobic and she only feels safe to take it out on her family members because she knows you won\u2019t hurt her/leave her (not an excuse just a possible explanation) which is a common trait in teens and young kids when they have negative emotions they take out on family/people they trust. But your sister isn\u2019t a child, and maybe she is that insecure she thinks everyone is out to get her for being transgender, despite none of the things you\u2019ve detailed having ANYTHING to do with that whatsoever", "You're welcome! It's completely understandable that you may feel hesitant or afraid to bring up the issue with your sister, especially considering her past behavior. However, having an open and honest conversation is an important step towards resolving conflicts and improving your relationship.\n\nWhen approaching the conversation, try to remain calm and use \"I\" statements to express your feelings without placing blame on her. For example, say something like \"I feel hurt and disrespected when you take my belongings without permission.\" This can help make the conversation more productive and less confrontational.\n\nIf you find that having a face-to-face conversation is too difficult, consider writing a letter or email to express your feelings. This can give you the opportunity to carefully choose your words and give your sister time to process your message before responding.\n\nRemember that setting boundaries is an essential part of any healthy relationship, and it's okay to take steps to protect yourself and your belongings. Good luck, and I hope you're able to find a resolution that works for both you and your sister!", "INFO : \n\nWhy your sister lives away? Where?\nSince when?\nShe is trans. Under hormones?

She has other options available.  \n\nIt sounds like she is projecting her own insecurities on you and your family.  It\u2019s not your responsibility to make her feel more like a woman.  Regardless of her gender identity, it doesn\u2019t give her a free pass to be verbally abusive or steal from you.  You mother minimizing this is enabling her behavior.  She is basically telling you that your needs, feelings, and safety are less important than your sister\u2019s.  If you\u2019re comfortable talking with your mom more openly, you should sit down and have an honest conversation with her. Tell her exactly how your sister\u2019s actions make you feel - not just that your sister does something you don\u2019t like.  You don\u2019t owe someone your patience when they can\u2019t give you basic respect.  Your parents can choose to allow her to be disrespectful and mean to them.

Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to ask her about it?", "My dad took my mom to the kitchen to have the conversation and my sister went in there and heard it. My dad was just trying to protect her in his own way, maybe if he tried talking to her himself it would have been better rather than asking my mom to do it, maybe she understood it all wrong and just started screaming before asking what was going on to them. I know how it sounds since she\u2019s an adult. And I\u2019m not saying my family is always in the right, but you have to agree that in this situation she had to place putting her gender identity in the middle of her screaming, it was so out of nowhere one else could believe in when mom told us everything that happened after she went to go out with her friends. Other replies here have asked if she\u2019s in hormones and if she\u2019s taking them properly, and that not taking your hormones properly can make you have this mood swings and, to me, it makes a lot of sense now, because if I remember correctly, she started acting like this around the time that I found out she was taking hormones, but I didn\u2019t know that not taking them properly could cause all of that. I am considering talking to her about it this time when she comes, I don\u2019t know if it is a good idea though, or if she\u2019ll feel uncomfortable talking to me. I am afraid she\u2019ll only end up screaming at me again.", "As I mentioned this is only my understanding so might not be \ud83d\udcaf but if it is then maybe inability to regularly access her meds could definitely be causing problems to manage regular dosage. I honestly don't know how you would approach her beyond the usual gently and without blame placing.\nIt would probably actually be really helpful for you to contact a local trans group for advice from people who can  not only help with understanding it better but also might have resources they can send your sister to so she can more reliably access her medication  :) \n\nPLEASE reddit peeps with more knowledge feel free to weigh in here?"]}
