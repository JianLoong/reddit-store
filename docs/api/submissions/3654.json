But, it wasn\u2019t a cake walk of a process or dealing with them. They were very controlling and negative. \n\nThey didn\u2019t help me when it came to dealing with the realtor or lender. I went in blind and handled it myself. I reached out to friends and other family if I had questions. It was so stressful. They signed the document and transferred the money. House/mortgage is solely in my name. \n\nClosing day came and everything calmed down. I\u2019m not big on social media but I\u2019ll post random things a couple times a year. A meme, my dog, promotion nothing crazy. So, I posted a picture of the house and said \u201cLife update: I\u2019m a homeowner.\u201d\n\nAll hell broke loose. My step mom lost her shit about my post. Called me horrible names and has been no contact with me since because I didn\u2019t include her in my post thanking her. She talks poorly about me over a post, even 2 years later. \n\nI explained when it happened I didn\u2019t include her because I didn\u2019t want anyone to come to her asking for money. My family would know they helped financially if I mentioned them. Second, I thanked her many times in person and didn\u2019t think a social media post was needed or wanted. She knows I\u2019m barley on there as is, hardly post and don\u2019t overshare. \n\nMy dad is split. He knows I\u2019m grateful and didn\u2019t care about the post but supports his wife.

Would it have been nice?  Sure.  Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an AH if you don\u2019t.\n\nI have a suspicion that the reason your mom is so upset is because she wants everyone to see what a *wonderful* mother she is for helping you out with all this money she could afford to give to you.
