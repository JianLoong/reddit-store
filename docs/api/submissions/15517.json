We were married for five years (together for seven), until Kelly fell down an extremist rabbit hole. Fundamentalist Christian Nationalism, anti-semitism (as well as other types of racism and xenophobia), and various conspiracy theories. Her new political beliefs caused so much stress and toxicity in our relationship (I\u2019m half Mexican but very \u2018white passing\u2019 as well as a social justice activist at the time). We divorced when Lily was one year old. \n\nAnyway, life went on. Kelly got remarried two years after our divorce to Rick, and according to her social media, their marriage is \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018godly\u2019. Basically, she is a SAHM to Lily as well as her three kids with Rick, only wears long skirts and dresses, and Rick is the sole authority figure in their household. I have no issues with this so long as it doesn\u2019t hurt Lily, but this isn\u2019t the case.\n\nUp until this point, Kelly has only ever allowed Lily to wear knee length skirts and dresses. According to her, it\u2019s against her and Rick\u2019s religious beliefs for girls to wear anything else. Lily never mentioned being uncomfortable wearing what her mom wants, so although I was frustrated with this rule, I let it be.\n\nRecently, Lily and I were out doing some spring shopping when she spotted some manakins wearing shorts, and asked if she could have some shorts to wear to school. I said yes, and bought her two pairs of shorts. The next day, Lily wore shorts to school. I knew that Kelly wouldn\u2019t approve, so I decided not to tell her. Unfortunately, Kelly found out via the school\u2019s Facebook page, and punished Lily by taking her phone and giving her extra chores. Kelly also contacted me, asking me how I could let our daughter go out \u201cdressed like a whore\u201d. I blew up! \n\nFirst of all, those shorts were not sexualizing or revealing at all, not to mention, she\u2019s ELEVEN! I shouted at her for sexualizing our daughter, and she got even angrier at me for going against her and Rick\u2019s religion. The call ended with me telling her that her and Rick\u2019s beliefs aren\u2019t the only ones that matter, that so long as she\u2019s under my roof Lily will be allowed to wear whatever she wants (within reason), and I hung up on her. \n\nKelly vented to some mutual friends of ours, and now they\u2019re saying that I\u2019m a horrible person for disrespecting Kelly and Rick\u2019s religious beliefs.
