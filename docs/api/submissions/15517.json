We divorced when Lily was one year old. \n\nAnyway, life went on. Kelly got remarried two years after our divorce to Rick, and according to her social media, their marriage is \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018godly\u2019.

I said yes, and bought her two pairs of shorts. The next day, Lily wore shorts to school. I knew that Kelly wouldn\u2019t approve, so I decided not to tell her. Unfortunately, Kelly found out via the school\u2019s Facebook page, and punished Lily by taking her phone and giving her extra chores. Kelly also contacted me, asking me how I could let our daughter go out \u201cdressed like a whore\u201d.

They're sexualizing an 11 year-old girl and teaching her to blame herself if she's ever a victim of sexual assault. \n\nShe's being taught that her only role in life is as a submissive wife who obeys her husband in all things.\n\nYou need to make sure Lily is not internalizing those beliefs\n\nThey may be teaching her that she has to have as many children as possible. Your wife has three kids with Rick, how long have they been married?\n\nThey may believe in corporal punishment.\n\nThey may want to home school her. Many of these extreme fundamentalists try to isolate their children so they aren't exposed to other ideas.\n\nYou may not be able to get full custody but I would at least try to get the custody agreement ammended so that Lily has to attend public school in person, that she's allowed to participate in extracurricular activities, and that she not be subject to corporal punishment.", "NTA.\n\nExtremists do not deserve respect since they give none nor do they earn it.\n\nYour \u201cmutual friends\u201d aren\u2019t.\n\nBe hyper aware and prepared re everything to do with Lily\u2019s care, especially as she becomes a tween.

Now I know who the market is for those awful Target dresses.", "NTA. \n\nTime to get full custody.  Kelly is no longer a safe person for your daughter, at all.  Calling an 11 year old a wh\\*re for wearing shorts is way out of line and I would definitely document everything and lawyer up.", "NTA\nYou need to protect your daughter somehow, and always be a safe place for her. \nMy mother experienced this, she chose not to pass on the religious trauma, I am forever grateful to her, for her strength. My heart breaks for your daughter.", "Document document document. \n\nAm Christian and this is nuts!", "YTA for not going for full custody", "NTA - It's shorts, the only reason theres a problem is because of their sexualising minds.

I have her during the week, so most of her school stuff is handled my either me or occasionally my fianc\u00e9. Our custody agreement actually already forbids corporal punishment (I was raised in a strict christian household and beaten frequently as a child, so I foresaw this becoming an issue and wanted to nip it in the bud), and I\u2019ve never seen bruises on her, and she\u2019s never told me about any violence towards her or her half siblings. As for Kelly and Rick\u2019s kids, I don\u2019t know much, other than that the two youngest are twins, and that they\u2019re trying for a third pregnancy right now. If my research is correct, they\u2019re part of the \u2018quiverfull\u2019 movement, so I don\u2019t expect them to stop trying to have more kids any time soon.

The stuff that goes on in those fundamentalist religions are a literal horror show for girls and women.  A super known example is the Duggars. Even without the SA, those kids were abused and parentified. \n\nAsk your daughter the extent she's expected to care for her 1/2 siblings. Ask how and what she is punished for at her moms. Ask how many of the household responsibilities are falling to an eleven year old. Ask if her mom has called her or her peers similar names in the past for clothing or anything else. Ask what she isn't allowed to do (examples like swimming, ballet, gymnastics or conversely, things considered more masculine). Also, most of all, ask if she likes spending time/living at her mom's and if she'd like to be with you more.\n\nI'm so glad she has you. Most young girls in her situation are forced to stick it out until 18 or get sucked into the cycle of abuse and married off young.

As you are part Mexican so is your daughter.  They are racists and can be abusive to your daughter. Also have a good sit down with your daughter.  Ask her about how they talk about her future.

And make sure you are talking these things through with your daughter as well and that she knows you are a safe space.", "Please talk with an experienced family law attorney.  It might be that your assumption you'll lose is unfounded.

If she, heaven forbid, experienced anything of the sort they would 100% tell her that her wearing shorts meant she invited it and caused the offender to falter. \n\nIt may be helpful to have some awkward conversations with your daughter about consent and assuring her that if ANYONE touched her body in ANY way without her consent that it is absolutely not her fault and not ok, period end of story. Open the lines of communication, just in case. Even if nothing happens to her within that community, that messaging of being at fault is toxic and insidious and needs to be counteracted so when she's old enough she can have healthy relationships and boundaries she is comfortable with because consent applies all the time not just before marriage.", "Once you get a lawyer, do a background check on everyone they've allowed around your kid", "I got HEATED for my cousins kids uncles saying that the 6 year old shouldn\u2019t wear an off the shoulder one piece swim suit because of \u201cthe perverts\u201d. That sentiment is what makes so many think that it\u2019s normal and okay to see children as sexual objects. My grandmother was basically telling my sisters friend that she might as well be asking for it for wearing a crop top (although she was an adult. But same sentiment). I looked at her and told her that that was one of the most disgusting things I\u2019ve ever heard her say"]}
