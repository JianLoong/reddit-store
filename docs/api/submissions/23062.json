If he really felt so strongly he could have just dipped out long enough for y'all to alter the reservation (some places don't seat incomplete parties); so if he wanted a Big Mac and would see y'all later, he could.

Patrick's behavior at the seafood restaurant was undoubtedly appalling and immature. His refusal to try anything on the menu and his loud, disrespectful outburst were completely uncalled for, especially in a public setting during a birthday getaway.\n\nWhile your reaction might have been driven by frustration, it's crucial to acknowledge that Patrick's actions were unacceptable and that he played a significant role in escalating the situation. Calling him out for his behavior is understandable, given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, when dealing with sensitive situations involving friends' significant others, it's essential to tread carefully and be mindful of how your words might affect your friend's feelings. Although Patrick was a huge AH, your friend Trina might still have feelings for him and could be caught in the middle of the conflict.\n\nConsider having a calmer and more empathetic conversation with Trina about how Patrick's behavior made you and others feel uncomfortable in private. Express your concerns and feelings without attacking him directly, and try to understand her perspective as well.\n\nUltimately, while Patrick's actions were unacceptable, handling the situation with empathy and understanding can help maintain a healthy friendship dynamic and foster open communication about challenging issues.", "I think this might be the last time Trina and her boyfriend get invited anywhere with this group. Not just from you, but if I were any of the other people there, I'm sure as hell not inviting him anywhere, even if that means Trina doesn't get invited either. I would tell her as such, check your boyfriend or you going to get fewer invites for places because no one wants to be around him.\n\nHe is a grown man and instead of handling this like an adult. He threw a temper tantrum. I guess his palette is the only thing associated with a child. (Nothing wrong with chicken tenders, I love them, but I also love Sushi.

And the sheer fact that he's getting his gf to demand an apology for being checked on his behavior, tells me everything I need to know about this man.\n\nI would sit down and have a long talk with Trina, about his behavior and hers. She is a direct reflection of her boyfriend, and she should have checked his behavior before it got to the point you need to lay it for him.\n\nI think he needs to not only apologize to you but the everyone who came on the trip for embarrassing them in public.

I applaud you for speaking up and putting him in his place.  He needed the time out.  Your girlfriend should run run run away from this relationship unless she wants the rest of her life to be mommy/toddler role play.", "ESH \n\nHe should have made it clear that he didn't like seafood in the group chat y'all had. It sounds like you and Annie gave people the opportunity to veto restaurant choices. \n\nThe reason I go with ESH is that I think you went too far on your response. Not everyone likes seafood and I don't think that alone makes him childish. I've traveled a lot myself and even in countries that are known for seafood, I don't usually like it and prefer to go with other food groups. \n\nWhat I'm saying is I think both parties could have handled this better but I will give you trying to make six different people on vacation happy is very difficult, so I'll assume you were a bit stressed doing all of the planning", "Clearly, you are NTA.

She sucks. How did she not know her bf disliked seafood? Did they only eat at McDonald\u2019s??? She should have left with Patrick as soon as he started throwing a fit. Just like you would do with a toddler. Just take him to get nuggets and Mac & cheese. Zero reason to stay and ruin everyone else\u2019s night. \n\nThe only ones that need to apologize are Patrick and Trina. \n\nI\u2019d also refrain from inviting them to any future vacations.

The problem is that he put no attention at all into the plans and then threw a tantrum like a child.\n\nIf this story is accurate as reported, NTA.", "NTA, but Patrick is a big time asshole.", "Not big on seafood myself anymore \u201cbad experience\u201d but if my partner says to me my friends and their partners are going to a seafood place for one of their birthdays and I would like you to come I would still go even if it\u2019s just for the partners sake and if I couldnt find anything I ate on the menu \u201cwhich I\u2019m sure there would of been something to eat even to get me through till the end\u201d I would be just as happy stopping off on the way home and getting something I could eat \u2026 NTA \u2026 he would of had warning in advance that was the destination or a possible destination so to act like that is terrible and embarrassing your partner like that in front of her friends and their partners \u2026. Oof", "My thought was maybe Trina is pregnant? And she can't eat some of this stuff, and bf was trying to help cover for her? Just a thought.", "I know! I find it weird that a seafood restaurant doesn't have some type of options for those who don't/can't eat seafood. I've never been to such a restaurant that doesn't have alternative options.", "I am not a fan of sushi, I like some fish but I'm picky about it. There is a sushi restaurant near my work that I've gone to for business lunches occasionally. Usually everyone else at the table will get sushi, and I get this phenomenal salad with chicken that's also on the menu. \n\nI usually try to make a point of checking out the menu of places before I go so I can plan ahead. My being a picky eater is my problem to deal with, not everyone else's. If there's really nothing I'll eat (which has never happened, there's always at least some appetizers that look good) I'll make sure to eat something before hand and have a few drinks while there and have an enjoyable evening with friends.", "I love getting chicken yakitori and pork gyoza when my partner gets sushi! Most decent sushi places have more than just kid food as alternatives to sea creatures.", "OP, my suggestion is that, very seriously, you write Trina off. Criticizing someone's SO literally never goes well, even if you are right to do so (and you are). I would not recommend apologizing but the friendship is over, even if she dumps him next week.", "The atmosphere is already ruined.  He and Trina ruined it.", "He's horrible and toxic. Their relationship is not bound to last. She should run while she still can.", "I have an autistic ex, and he reacts EXACTLY like the OP's post to food/restaurants he doesn't like. He also only likes chicken tenders.", "Trina is partly responsible for the behavior of the plus-one *she* brought on the trip.\n\nWe all have a responsibility not to bring assholes/brats/abusers around our loved ones.\n\nIf Trina wants this in her life, then that's her choice, but people are going to blame her for *exposing* them to his behavior, not for the behavior itself.", "Im allergic to crustaceans.... i simply let them know to please try to be aware of cooking my fish meal on the same grill. Im not allergic to shellfish or normal fish. I can eat fried clams, calamari, mahi etc. Just not lobster cran shrimp etc. I get shit ALL the time like you have sea food allergies why are you here im like im only allergic to a specific type... theres no reason they cant simply cook my fish seperate for 10 mins. I love fish. Am i just never supposed to go to a seafood place?", "I have never been to a sushi restaurant that didn't at least have cucumber rolls and there's almost always 3-5 other vegetarian roll options on the menu (granted, my experience with sushi restaurants have all been in the US and Europe).", "It\u2019s childish behaviour and I don\u2019t think making a scene counts as poor communication.", "That \"meme\" exists because it's fucking true. You're right, there is a literal difference between being a bad communicator and being a child, but the point is that if you're bad enough at communicating that your solution is to throw a tantrum, you fully deserve to be shamed and compared to a child.\n\nObviously this does not apply to developmentally disabled or autistic people, don't shame people for things out of their control.", "I see the opposite situation, he wanted to go but checking the restaurant was too much of a hassle, then he found out too late what kind of restaurant it was so he forced his girlfriend to side his tantrum", "NTA. If he couldn't bother to read the group chat he waived his right to object. \n\nBut wow, your friend is dating a kindergartener", "esh, but for very different reasons.   \nas someone who doesnt like seafood, i always make sure theres something on the menu prior to going if its a predominantly seafood restaurant. normally asian cuisine includes chicken/beef/pork, so its usually not an issue. my friends are also aware that i dont eat seafood so if we go out somewhere theyre already checking the menu for options too.   \n\n\nhes the ah: because it is his job to make sure there is something availible to him- he or his girlfriend were aware he didnt like seafood but werent involved enough in the planning to say something as simple as \"hey he doesnt like seafood, lets find a place with a variety\" people are plenty friendly to accomodate because some people just have preferences- everything couldve been fixed by that simple statement. also for yelling in a restaurant  \n\n\ntrinas the ah: for the exact same reason. she knows her man, maybe her man wasnt involved in the planning bc he thought the girls were handling it. if my man was planning an outing with his friends hed be sure to tell them that i have preferences.   \n\n\nyoure the ah: regardless of what he did, or what your friend didnt do, yelling at someone and calling them names in the middle of a resturaunt is kinda..ehh..  now i get that he started it for sure.. but some people get overwhelmed at small things and need a second to calm down. it sounds like he was overwhelmed by the fact that there was nothing on the menu he could eat and screaming at him and calling him names probably made things worse. if i were in the same position id be looking on the menu like \"hey no theres gotta be something youd like\" and try to help the situation, and not make them feel hated on even more.   \n\n\nDO NOT get me wrong he is very much a larger ah here for causing a scene but on all parts this couldve been avoided with all of your help. i dont blame you though, this isnt an attack on you. everyone here couldve just handled things differently", "NTA.. that guy sounds awful", "He\u2019s a grown ass man throwing a tantrum over chicken tenders. NTA and Tina needs to run!", "I recently joined my bf and a friend to a sushi spot. I'm not a huge fan of fish, but I checked the menu ahead of time to see what my options were. Guess what? I found something! The pork ramen was delicious", "Also karaage chicken is simply Japanese fried chicken ffs.", "He\u2019s a grown man throwing a temper tantrum because the restaurant didn\u2019t have chicken tendies. You know, like a poorly behaved five year-old would. If I pulled that when I was five, I\u2019d be pulled out of the restaurant and given a STERN talking to. You gave him the stern talking to - unfortunately, you couldn\u2019t put him in time-out.", "Oh yeah, the sushi place I usually go to has noodle dishes, yakitori, wantons,  gyoza, shishimi, and more. But they do also have chicken tenders litterally on the kid section of the menu.", "I meant it is litterally on the children's section of the menu, but sure, neckbeards love their chicken tendeis.", "Spaghetti is also on many children's menus; are all Italians, therefore, either children or neckbeards?", "I am a low-dependency autistic adult who has had meltdowns before. This was NOT a meltdown, this was childish behavior. This was someone who actively refused to communicate and then was livid because people didn't somehow read his mind from a distance.", "Spaghetti isn\u2019t neckbeard food. Yendies are \ud83d\udcaf", "Yeah, there\u2019s a difference between a meltdown and a tantrum. This was a tantrum."]}
