If he really felt so strongly he could have just dipped out long enough for y'all to alter the reservation (some places don't seat incomplete parties); so if he wanted a Big Mac and would see y'all later, he could.

Patrick's behavior at the seafood restaurant was undoubtedly appalling and immature. His refusal to try anything on the menu and his loud, disrespectful outburst were completely uncalled for, especially in a public setting during a birthday getaway.\n\nWhile your reaction might have been driven by frustration, it's crucial to acknowledge that Patrick's actions were unacceptable and that he played a significant role in escalating the situation. Calling him out for his behavior is understandable, given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, when dealing with sensitive situations involving friends' significant others, it's essential to tread carefully and be mindful of how your words might affect your friend's feelings. Although Patrick was a huge AH, your friend Trina might still have feelings for him and could be caught in the middle of the conflict.\n\nConsider having a calmer and more empathetic conversation with Trina about how Patrick's behavior made you and others feel uncomfortable in private. Express your concerns and feelings without attacking him directly, and try to understand her perspective as well.\n\nUltimately, while Patrick's actions were unacceptable, handling the situation with empathy and understanding can help maintain a healthy friendship dynamic and foster open communication about challenging issues.", "I think this might be the last time Trina and her boyfriend get invited anywhere with this group. Not just from you, but if I were any of the other people there, I'm sure as hell not inviting him anywhere, even if that means Trina doesn't get invited either. I would tell her as such, check your boyfriend or you going to get fewer invites for places because no one wants to be around him.\n\nHe is a grown man and instead of handling this like an adult. He threw a temper tantrum. I guess his palette is the only thing associated with a child. (Nothing wrong with chicken tenders, I love them, but I also love Sushi. But i wouldn't throw a temper tantrum over it).\n\nI don't think you said anything you need to apologize for, but he does. And the sheer fact that he's getting his gf to demand an apology for being checked on his behavior, tells me everything I need to know about this man.\n\nI would sit down and have a long talk with Trina, about his behavior and hers. She is a direct reflection of her boyfriend, and she should have checked his behavior before it got to the point you need to lay it for him.\n\nI think he needs to not only apologize to you but the everyone who came on the trip for embarrassing them in public. And until he does, he can eat solo for the rest of the trip.

Especially causing strife between you all. \n\nHe is going to end up isolating her from you.....\n\nShe may choose him if the ultimatum is given, but try to not let that happen. \n\nTell her you will not apologize but you can admit that you could have pointed out things on the menu that he may have been alright with instead of blowing up immediately. However, it should not be your job to do so, he is an adult and can read and make decisions for himself. \n\nNot an apology but acknowledging there were other avenues to handle it might appease him enough to not go cut off mode for your friend.", "I hate seafood.

I applaud you for speaking up and putting him in his place.  He needed the time out.  Your girlfriend should run run run away from this relationship unless she wants the rest of her life to be mommy/toddler role play.", "ESH \n\nHe should have made it clear that he didn't like seafood in the group chat y'all had. It sounds like you and Annie gave people the opportunity to veto restaurant choices. \n\nThe reason I go with ESH is that I think you went too far on your response. Not everyone likes seafood and I don't think that alone makes him childish. I've traveled a lot myself and even in countries that are known for seafood, I don't usually like it and prefer to go with other food groups. \n\nWhat I'm saying is I think both parties could have handled this better but I will give you trying to make six different people on vacation happy is very difficult, so I'll assume you were a bit stressed doing all of the planning", "Clearly, you are NTA.

You do not have to massage his wounded ego because he didn't get his chicky nuggies.

I also wouldn't have insisted on going somewhere else if everyone else in the group was keen on trying something out.

She sucks. How did she not know her bf disliked seafood? Did they only eat at McDonald\u2019s??? She should have left with Patrick as soon as he started throwing a fit. Just like you would do with a toddler. Just take him to get nuggets and Mac & cheese. Zero reason to stay and ruin everyone else\u2019s night. \n\nThe only ones that need to apologize are Patrick and Trina. \n\nI\u2019d also refrain from inviting them to any future vacations.

But everyone else was clearly onboard with the restaurant choice - except Trina, who chose to placate Patrick instead - so his grown up choices were to: suck it up and deal for the course of one dinner, choose not to eat and grab something later, or politely excuse himself from this particular meal (\u2018Sorry, guys. I missed the message about coming here, and I really can\u2019t stand seafood. You have a blast; I\u2019m gonna grab a burger and watch the game, and I\u2019ll meet you all back at the hotel after.

It's not as simple as \"smile while you're there or excuse yourself\", especially if your partner thinks that SA is just something that you can ignore for a period of time.  I wouldn't be aggressive toward the group, but I would have a bunch of pent-up feelings that might need to get vented out, because I was in a situation that was causing me distress, yet expected to smile and stay, or somehow leave and later have a conversation with my partner over how I couldn't commit to being uncomfortable for a bit, instead of having them understand that I didn't want to be there in the first place. \n\nHis complaining about the menu was basically him saying \"I don't want to be here.\"  He didn't say \"Is this all they have?\"   because he already knew.\n\nHe was basically there, because she wanted him to be there.   \n\nThen you insulted him.  It wasn't about the menu.  It wasn't about not being able to eat guac and chips while people had meals.
