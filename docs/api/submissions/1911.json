I tried calling her number today and it told me the phone was no longer in service which means she either didn\u2019t pay her bill or the number is changed. \n\n\nLast month, my 18 year old reached out to my younger daughter to ask if she could stay for a few days (she sent this message at 2am) so I\u2019m not sure what was going on but my younger daughter stays up late on weekends and I told my younger daughter to let her know it was fine.

It\u2019s the only reason why she be willing to contact the sister. If you truly don\u2019t understand why she left (which I doubt), the sister clearly knows the entire deal. But one thing for certain, this is your blood. Your baby girl. Your first born (assuming). She is 18. A child. Who is trying to find her way in life. She needs complete and total support from you. Maybe you need to go through a picture book and realize that she is still that little girl that looks up to her daddy. Regardless of you feel like she doesn\u2019t. She needs help right now. Forget about financial implications. Lead her in the right direction by becoming understanding and self less. She is literally still just a teen who seems to have lost her way.", "she is your child. And if your child is asking for shelter, you fucking give it to them. You cannot shame your daughter, who is barely an adult, because she \"needs something\". Fun fact: kids needs things, like a place to stay sometimes, a bit of cash if they can't keep up with bills, a meal when they can't afford food. You cannot shame your child for needing things. And the one person on this planet who is meant to give her these things? oh look, that would be you.", "I didn\u2019t even think of that", "It's really strange....why don't you know this kind of things? Even if she hates you for no valid reason (what you believe) for her there must be a reason or she's being pushed to no contact? I would find out and move heaven and earth for my daughter.", "That says everything you need to know. She doesn't trust you, and you messed up big time as a mother for things to reach this point. It's obvious by what you don't say there's information important yet incriminating for you, and even by its absence it speaks volumes.", "Could you not ask your other daughter why she is angry with you? If they are still in contact and willing to call her when she needs help she may know why she frustrated at home.  It could help get to the root of the problem. \n\nAlso maybe don\u2019t get so angry with her.  It difficult if you feel like she pushing your buttons but telling her she not welcome back home is a bit harsh.  She 18 you don\u2019t want her to do something stupid where she could put herself in danger.  As much as she makes you angry it\u2019s better she comes homes where it\u2019s safe rather in some ditch somewhere.", "Yeah, my mother thinks there is no reason I went no contact too. Enjoy your delusion.", "Does this have to do with the father of your youngest?", "Awe. I just want to say that I hope you are in a place now where you always feel safe, loved and heard - whether it's you still being with that boy or whether it's you finding other people who make you feel that way. Hugs to you.", "My sister hasn't spoken to my dad in six years. Recently, someone incorrectly thought my dad had died. When her mother told my sister, she didn't care. Her mom said she kind of shrugged. Let me tell you, she got everything she wanted. My dad was very different when raising her. We're 18 years apart.\n\nYet he said if she contacted him, he would accept her. That's crazy to me, but that's a loving parent for you.", "OP probably screams the house down at her about boys.", "I mean it\u2019s not uncommon. I know people who cut their parents off but, usually in those cases it\u2019s due to abuse of their partners. If she needs a place to stay I\u2019ll assume she not staying with him. But also how was she expected to stay with her mom and not be in the same spaces this confusing and honest I don\u2019t want to say she lying about something but, 2+2 is giving 10 with this. This is most definitely a half a*s story.", "OP also seems more concerned with being respected rather than if her daughter is safe, if she has somewhere (safe and warm) to sleep at night, if she\u2019s eating properly, if she\u2019s healthy\u2026.", "Every time a parent is on AITA banging on about \u2018disrespect\u2019 they\u2019re always the AH. They always never actually care about their kids, just being in control of them.", "Worried more about being respected?\nSo allow some one to disrespect you and kiss someone ass instead? No there are boundaries. And not to coddle every behavior just because that their child. \nThat's the my child can never do no wrong trend. It's wrong to call someone out for their behavior.", "She's not contacting her.\nWait. If it's a two way street like you say and someone is reaching out and the other is not meeting you half way then obviously why would you even bother? \nShe doesn't know so she is contacting the daughter and the daughter cut her off disrespectfully. So you get what you've asked for.", "Yes and now her younger sil longs have no contact with their older sister because of op using younger daughter to send that  text", "I\u2019ve tried to say something similar before, but in the past if my younger daughter mentions me to her, my oldest will get upset and block her periodically. But this time is different since I now know she changed her number. I don\u2019t know why exactly but I am upset that she would cut contact off with her little sister who wants nothing more than to be able to have a healthy relationship with her and she\u2019s taking her animosity and in return, robbing my daughter of her sister in order to get back at me.", "The daughter cut her off. So how can she?", "I didn't say to tolerate disrespect, but it's a hallmark of narcissistic parents to care MORE about being disrespected than about the safety of their children.  A healthy parent would send the message you can always come back for help if you need it, not tell an 18 year old to never count on them again because their feelings got hurt.\n\nDon't you think it's weird that this parent has NO IDEA why their kid went NC?  Google \"missing reasons.\"", "> I don\u2019t know why exactly but I am upset that she would cut contact off with her little sister \n\nShe cut off contact with her younger sister because you kept making younger sister pass messages to her. Even after you knew your daughter wanted no contact with you. That alone shows you have no respect for your daughter or her boundaries.\n\nAnd this continued \"I did nothing wrong! She's just chasing boys!\" is not doing anything to make you look good. Very rarely in a situation like this is anyone without blame. And you keep showing just how little you know (or care to know) your oldest daughter.", "Because she knows you'll use her sister to try make contact, and has enough negative feeling for you that just the mention of you is a trigger. I suspect it's far from the first time you've been unable to leave well enough alone, and that's why your eldest has gone NC with you. You shove your oldest daughter away, cost her a relationship with her younger sister, and still make out yourself as the victim.\n\nShe isn't trying to get back at you, you've obviously left a trauma in her that I hope she's getting help for. Her getting back at you makes you a martyr, and you haven't earned that.", "To get back at you for what exactly? Didn't you say you didn't do anything?", "She cut off contact because you reached out multiple times through younger sister. You are interfering in their relationship.", "OP, you're the one robbing your younger daughter of a relationship with her sister. The moment you used her phone number as a proxy for your words, you violated the older daughter's trust in that communication. \n\nYTA", "She has to protect herself from you, and you're cruelly using your other daughter to try to get at her. Obviously she's going to stop contact when it's just an attack ftom you to her. You're painfully resistant to accepting any responsibility for all of this.", "She cut contact with her little sister because you were using her little sister to try to reconnect. You put your youngest daughter in the middle and now you cost her the relationship with her older sister.", "Maybe don\u2019t use your other daughter phone to contact her but let the sisters build a relationship.  Just make sure to tell your younger daughter, that you want her sister to be safe and create a safe space so she can open up to you if she willing to share any information. \n\nAs you don\u2019t know what your 18 doing outside the house, its good that she has a link through your other daughter back home.  As much as it\u2019s hard not knowing what\u2019s going on, she has shown some maturity by coming home through her sister.  \n\nYou could try reaching out to the school to see if there any support through the  counselling services to see if there any support / tips and how to forge a better relationship with your elder daughter.  It could help with your stress levels as it must be hard dealing with your eldest hostility and not knowing if she okay when she not home.   Sometimes tough love isn\u2019t the best approach.", "God you\u2019re delusional. \n\nFirst off, she\u2019s not robbing your daughter of shit. You chose to have multiple children. She didn\u2019t get a choice in being a sister and she doesn\u2019t owe anyone a relationship. And you think she\u2019s entitled? Talk about being a massive hypocrite. Your other daughter is not entitled to a relation. You are not entitled to a relationship. \n\nSecondly, this isn\u2019t about getting back at you. This is about her establishing boundaries. Right bot, that daughter still lives at home. She knows a relationship with her means risking exposure to you, and she\u2019s not willing to do that. You should reflect on your own behavior here to determine what made your daughter have to go to such an extreme. \n\nShe may be willing to have a relationship with siblings as they move out, but not while they\u2019re living with you.", "She had almost 19 years to figure it out, and she fucked up on almost every step. Whatever happens from here on is full on OP."]}
