I was born after a year of my mom getting remarried to my dad. My half siblings never really saw me as a brother, they would not acknowledge me at family events like Christmas parties or anytime. They would always ignore me. I tried to talk to them but they would always find a way to talk to someone else or just ignore me. They would always acknowledge my cousins but never me and I was always distant when on family photos. My half siblings would always show affection to my cousins same age as me and bring them gifts but I was always left out, even my aunts and uncles ignored me. Mg parents never really tried to encourage them to be warmer to me though so that hurts. Cherry had her engagement party a couple days ago, I was looked at weirdly by the guest because they never knew she had another brother other than Jack and Kent. Her Fiance, Mark tried to engage in a conversation with me, saying \"I never knew Cherry had a younger brother.\" I felt uncomfortable and hurt talking to him because it hurts knowing I was never seen as family by her. I told him to please not talk to me anymore because I didn't want to intrude on my sister's life. He tried to reassure me that it wouldn't be a problem and I won't intrude on anything. He told me I he always wanted to have a younger brother and I won't be a problem. I just told him no and said my sister doesn't consider me as a brother so you shouldn't consider me as one too. He was hurt by this and tried to comfort me saying she does see me as a brother, but I just ignored him and left, sitting outside. My mom and dad later scolded on the drive home me for telling that to my sister's fiance and that she does care about. Now I'm grounded for a month. My sister later called me saying that I made her fiance mad at her and I should \"grow the fuck up\" and \"forget about the past\". I hang up on her and blocked her. I really don't know what to do because I really wanted to have a relationship with Mark because he seems really nice and genuine, but I feel like I don't belong and hurt whenever I'm in a family events or talking to him. I just can't get over how I was just ignored by them.\n\nI am the asshole? Maybe I acted to much to Mark and I should have just forget how they treated me.", "created_utc": 1693576722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1677wiy/aita_for_telling_my_half_sisters_fiance_not_to/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't her brother all your life but now she wants to look good for her fiance... You're related all of a sudden now? I hate people like that. Honestly can't believe you got grounded for telling the truth. No one cares about your feelings in this situation? Nice.", "NTA. I don't get the people saying OP was doing the same thing his sister was doing. OP, who again is FIFTEEN and has been rejected by his older siblings his whole life, was protecting himself from either having his sister get mad at him for \"trying to force his way into her family by getting close to her fiance\" or from establishing a bond with someone only to have the sister squash it.  The sister and parents are upset because they've been exposed for being the assholes they are. OP did nothing wrong.", "If your half-siblings and extended family still treat you like that now, it's not in the past. Honestly, I would just send a message to Mark explaining everything and that you wish to not cause them any problems in their marriage. That's why you said what you said at the engagement.  Say you prefer low contact (basically holidays/events). You can include your sister if you want in the joint message. But you're not the asshole.", "Wasn't this already posted ?? Even the same words, but you changed the conflict. At least be creative.", "[Same post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163lmjp/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_can_ground_me/)\n\nStill NTA unless you stole it", "NTA your sister is reaping what she sowed. She was cold to you, so it's natural you'd be cold to her fiance, as an extension of her. The thing your parents and sister will have to deal with, that is uncomfortable to them, is the fiance telling his family about this interaction with you, which will make them look like the AHs they are.\n\nAlso you're 15. You're a child. The adults in this situation, your sister and especially your parents, should have done better", "NTA.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t know your sister had you as a brother how does he know his fianc\u00e9e sees you as one?\n\nThey are upset because their actions or inactions have been shown to an outside party.  You wasn\u2019t rude you embarrassed them.\n\nIf I was you I wouldn\u2019t go to the wedding, or tell your parents that.  It will get you in trouble initially but it will force them to address how your siblings and they have treated you.\n\nMy caveat is I do confront issues though, you seem to as well from what I\u2019ve read.", "Your sister is TA, but her fianc\u00e9 seems nice. I would make friends with him and ignore her.", "NTA. Mark has the right to know what kind of \"family\" he is marrying into.", "NTA your parents certainly are. They allowed your siblings to treat you like shit and they do nothing. You stand up for yourself and they ground you for a month. Fuck your entire family. Consider going no contact when you turn 18.", "NTA and honestly you should pursue the relationship with Mark, if nothing else than to spite your sister", "You were and still are in a no-win situation.  Your two options were:\n\n\u2022 Engage with Mark and cause Cherry to further alienate you, or\n\n\u2022 Disengage and further alienate yourself.\n\nYou chose the option that minimized your risk, and you should be commended for that.  Your parents and your siblings, on the other hand, need to be put on full blast for their awful behavior.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA and your parents and sister are wrong.", "NTA- if mark didn\u2019t even know you existed just proved that SHE hadn\u2019t forgot the past and still hadn\u2019t accepted you into her life.", "NTA YOU weren't considered her brother UNTIL she looked bad to her BF.  The fact your parents grounded you would make me dig in my heels even more.", "NTA.\n\nKinda seems to me that she wanted you to play at happy family in front of her spouse. Without telling you.\n\nWell, you didn't, and now your sisters fiancee is coming to the realization of who your sister really is.\n\nThis is on her, not you.", "NAH\n\nYou don\u2019t want any relationship with your sister or her fianc\u00e9 and that\u2019s okay. But, your soon to be BIL is not responsible for your sister\u2019s actions in the past and didn\u2019t do anything wrong by trying to have a relationship with you.", "YTA ONLY TO YOURSELF. Allow yourself to develop decent relationships with other people DESPITE how your family mistreats you (B which they still are. NOT in the past). Do not allow them to gaslight you over you stating how it is and them dealing with the justifiable disgust of other decent people over their own behavior. I's be a friend/brother to the brother in law and hold nothing back when speaking on how you were treated. He deserves to truly know who he is marrying, after all.", "This is somewhere between NAH and you being the asshole. Mark didn't do anything wrong to you and you basically responded in exactly the same way you complained about your half-sisters acting.\n\nIt also sounds like therapy could work to help unpack some of this, especially given the huge age gap mentioned makes the brother/sister relationship more complicated to begin with. Like, even if you were their full-blood sibling, a gap of 12 years means that it'd be hard to find common ground to hang out on when you were a younger kid.", "ESH except future BIL\n\nYour siblings for ignoring you. Your parents for not getting involved. You for pushing your hurt onto a well-meaning bystander. \n\nYou're 15. So I'll give you the softest ah rating. \nPlease try to find a way into therapy so you can avoid future messes.", "YTA\n\nAren't you doing to Mark, what you claim your half siblings are doing to you; not giving him a chance and ignoring him?  Here is an emphatic person asking about you (everything you wished for) and you chose the path of martyrdom for what??  There is nothing wrong with being wary of new relationships, but you seem to have overreacted here. (btw  Cherry is an AH for saying forget about the past without ever taking time to own it)", "Very soft YTA. This is a difficult situation and I can imagine how hard it has been for you to feel left out by your family. I understand where you're coming from and why you lashed out at Mark the way you did; however, it sounds like he was genuinely interested in becoming involved in your life. \n\nYour family is definitely TA for treating you this way.", "Small YTA. Mark was nice to you and you shouldn\u2019t have lashed out at him. He is innocent. Maybe your sister will never be a real sister to you but Mark could be a friend. \nYou should contact him and apologize.\nIt\u2019s sad that neither your siblings nor your parents did anything to improve your relationship.\n\nMaybe it can be explained by the fact that your mom started dating your Dad 1 or 2 years after their father passed away. It\u2019s very short. There were some similar stories on Reddit and if both your mom and your dad acted entitled, your siblings may have resented them and you paid the price. They were children at that time.\nBut they are also AH for not trying to be better siblings to you when they grew older.", "Did you make two throw away accounts to post the same thing?", "Is my math wrong?  Your mom was 46 when she had you?  Oh dear.  \n\nYour siblings stink, teenagers know better than to ignore their baby brother, they did this on purpose.  You parents also stink, why did they allow this for so long, I get not pressuring your kids to LOVE their half-brother, but they could be civil.  You were not invisible. \n\nYou need counseling to figure things out, you should not have mistreated your future BIL, he never did anything wrong.  You even admit you want to have him as your big brother.  Apologize to him, the others do as you want, but he did nothing to deserve your attitude.  I reserve my judgement because you are so young and have years of neglect on your shoulders to deal with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
