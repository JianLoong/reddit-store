I was born after a year of my mom getting remarried to my dad. My half siblings never really saw me as a brother, they would not acknowledge me at family events like Christmas parties or anytime. They would always ignore me. I tried to talk to them but they would always find a way to talk to someone else or just ignore me. They would always acknowledge my cousins but never me and I was always distant when on family photos. My half siblings would always show affection to my cousins same age as me and bring them gifts but I was always left out, even my aunts and uncles ignored me. Mg parents never really tried to encourage them to be warmer to me though so that hurts. Cherry had her engagement party a couple days ago, I was looked at weirdly by the guest because they never knew she had another brother other than Jack and Kent. Her Fiance, Mark tried to engage in a conversation with me, saying \"I never knew Cherry had a younger brother.\" I felt uncomfortable and hurt talking to him because it hurts knowing I was never seen as family by her. I told him to please not talk to me anymore because I didn't want to intrude on my sister's life. He tried to reassure me that it wouldn't be a problem and I won't intrude on anything. He told me I he always wanted to have a younger brother and I won't be a problem. I just told him no and said my sister doesn't consider me as a brother so you shouldn't consider me as one too. He was hurt by this and tried to comfort me saying she does see me as a brother, but I just ignored him and left, sitting outside. My mom and dad later scolded on the drive home me for telling that to my sister's fiance and that she does care about. Now I'm grounded for a month. My sister later called me saying that I made her fiance mad at her and I should \"grow the fuck up\" and \"forget about the past\". I hang up on her and blocked her. I really don't know what to do because I really wanted to have a relationship with Mark because he seems really nice and genuine, but I feel like I don't belong and hurt whenever I'm in a family events or talking to him. I just can't get over how I was just ignored by them.\n\nI am the asshole?

It\u2019s very short. There were some similar stories on Reddit and if both your mom and your dad acted entitled, your siblings may have resented them and you paid the price.

You were not invisible. \n\nYou need counseling to figure things out, you should not have mistreated your future BIL, he never did anything wrong.  You even admit you want to have him as your big brother.  Apologize to him, the others do as you want, but he did nothing to deserve your attitude.

Wow.\n\nNTA", "That'll teach you to tell the truth!", "sister's fiancee didn't even know of this kid's existence, which very much displays how she currently feels and what she consistently does.", "Isn\u2019t it weird as hell to look at the sibling of your nieces or nephews and not perceive some sort of connection there? Sure it\u2019s not quite the same and it isn\u2019t blood, but half of your aunts and uncles have no blood relation to you either. Maybe my extended family is just unusually loose with who we consider family, but I just find that sort of perspective strange.", "NTA- Try to think of it this way. You are two outsiders in this family, you have a common bond to begin a new friendship.", "NTA why is your childish ass sister talking to you as if shes not the one that needs to grow up.", "NTA but I would encourage you to talk to Mark when possible.  It might be that you find an older friend who will do those things with you that you have missed out on so far.  Don't be fake, don't lie to make someone else seem better/worse than they are, just be yourself and see if a friendship starts to grow.", "nta- I am sorry. your parents should have done a better job with the older siblings.  you did nothing wrong. we are taught to tell the truth.", "I am so sorry every single one of your family are heartless assholes. I can\u2019t imagine the loneliness and longing you\u2019re going through right now. But please know that people will come into your life that will love you more than your family ever did. You\u2019re still young but you can live your life when you graduate and move out, meet new people and build a happy life of your own.\n\nHang in there, pal. Better days will come. NTA.", ">Now I'm grounded for a month. My sister later called me saying that I made her fiance mad at her and I should \"grow the fuck up\" and \"forget about the past\".\n\nTranslation: her fiancee thinks less of her so now you have to play along so she can hide it. Which is bs. I have no idea why you're grounded, much less for a month. Raised three other kids and still doesn't know how to raise kids. NTA.", "NTA. Their, including uncles/aunts, cruelty knows no bounds. Shame on your parents for grounding you.\n\nSee if you can have a big brother/little brother relationship with Mark outside of their families, including Cherry. He may be a lifeline for you. Apologize to him if you're re-considering this.\n\nOr talk to your principal at school if you want legal emancipation from your parents. I know it's a radical suggestion. But your parents allowed her other children & relatives to treat you poorly all those years and not standing up for you. To me it is a good reason for it. Up to you totally", "NTA. Everyone is basically mad because you didn't go along with their lie. If it was truly all in the past your half sister wouldn't have made a scene and she'd be trying to talk to you more calmly and apologetically.\n\nI'm glad her fiance is angry on your behalf. It shows that he has a good head on his shoulders and he realized exactly who he was about to tie the knot with.", "Yeah, this was basically a no win situation for OP. His sister and other siblings have made it very clear that they want nothing to do with him his whole life and that he isn't considered family even in the slightest. If he went along with the fiance, he'd be screwed because his sister would be mad that it appeared he found a way to force himself into her life, by admitting the truth, which is that he's unwanted, his sister is mad that it makes her look bad. Frankly it isn't a big leak for the fiance to figure it out anyway though, he's dated this woman long enough to propose to her and she never once mentioned that she had a younger brother.  That in and of itself should have been telling.", "Sounds like he is still in pain", "Or if he can, he can try for legal emancipation.", "right? OP\u2019s sister telling him to grow up is just nonsense. They\u2019re 15!!! A literal child being bullied by a sibling 12 years older than them. What\u2019s truly childish is the fianc\u00e9 is now finding out about a younger sibling. Who does that?", "I suggested the same", " Raised three other kids and still doesn't know how to raise kids. NTA.", "Right? The fianc\u00e9 is all \u201cof course she sees you as a brother!\u201d When she hadn\u2019t even told him said brother existed until that very day. Like, how does he know how she sees OP?", "Sounds like he is still in pain", "My own extended family is definitely generously loosey goosey on who is considered family. We all trooped out of state for the funeral of my sister-in-law's mother, for example (after many years of combined holidays with inlaws, outlaws, and everybody and their brothers). I would definitely feel a familial connection to the half-sibling of my \"blood\" niblings. But many people wouldn't, as evidenced by the many comments I've seen on AITA posts about the new siblings of someone whose mother or father died and the surviving parent remarried. In those situations, commenters are always reminding people that the extended family of the dead person aren't family to the new children created after the remarriage. \n\nIf OP was indeed referring to his maternal relatives, that's definitely very odd that they would ignore him.\n\nEdit: I may be having a brain fart, but aren't you blood related to all your aunts and uncles if your parents are your biological parents?"]}
