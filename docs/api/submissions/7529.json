It would definitely be a good investment even though I understand you probably don't want to spend money on her.", "Skinner v.

History tells us that letting any kind of power besides the individual in question have say over who can or cannot have children is dangerous.", "I know that. But what im more wondering about.. for example POCs are also more often in prison out of prejudice Than white people. Its unfair and yet we don't say no more prison. \n\n>any kind of power besides the individual in question have say over who can or cannot have children is dangerous\n\nThats true. But as long as a ban of abortion exists in the same places where this argument is used against forced sterilization as a legal consequence, it feels just like \"want more babies\". Especially since sterilization, even when forced, isn't dangerous to the human body itself, like an forced birth could be, including an illegal home abortion.

In my experience, people who have finally gotten off drugs but then have partners who continue to use drugs never stay clean for long.\nI\u2019ve been in CPS for ten years and for twenty years previous I was a social worker for people with HIV/AIDS starting in the early 1990\u2019s.  It was very emotional, I had seen so many people die horrible deaths and just be forgotten.  But the struggles and pain in the lives of children that I see every day now is far more emotionally difficult to handle for me, partly because I\u2019m a father and it\u2019s hard not to imagine how I\u2019d feel off my kids were going through these things.  But all in all, maintaining my mental equilibrium in CPS is more difficult that being enmeshed in the AIDS crisis of the early 1990\u2019s.", "One of my closest friends in middle school was a crack baby. She wasn\u2019t even born in a hospital. She was born in either a shitty motel or crappy apartment. Big reason she even survived was because some older guy next door heard a baby crying and called 911. But it turned out good for her, she was extremely lucky to find two literal saints who fostered and adopted her. They were there through her withdrawals with her.", "This isn't remotely true. A quick google finds all of one case where a woman in the UK was sterilised against her will, and it was largely because pregnancy put her life at risk and she was deemed not able to meaningfully understand what birth control meant due to disabilities.", "It's also time to tell you you will absolutely NOT take the baby, so you remove that enabling safety net, and that the baby will just go into foster care and she'll never see it again, and that would be so cruel.", "I also don\u2019t understand why kids are just a commodity to people.
