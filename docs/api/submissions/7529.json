Its unfair and yet we don't say no more prison. \n\n>any kind of power besides the individual in question have say over who can or cannot have children is dangerous\n\nThats true. But as long as a ban of abortion exists in the same places where this argument is used against forced sterilization as a legal consequence, it feels just like \"want more babies\". Especially since sterilization, even when forced, isn't dangerous to the human body itself, like an forced birth could be, including an illegal home abortion.

In my experience, people who have finally gotten off drugs but then have partners who continue to use drugs never stay clean for long.\nI\u2019ve been in CPS for ten years and for twenty years previous I was a social worker for people with HIV/AIDS starting in the early 1990\u2019s.  It was very emotional, I had seen so many people die horrible deaths and just be forgotten.  But the struggles and pain in the lives of children that I see every day now is far more emotionally difficult to handle for me, partly because I\u2019m a father and it\u2019s hard not to imagine how I\u2019d feel off my kids were going through these things.
