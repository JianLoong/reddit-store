My grandmother is very judgemental if things don\u2019t fit into her \u201cperfect picture\u201d and I feel like I have to preform anytime I\u2019m around my family. I have recently moved into my own house with my 2yr old son Elliot after  living with my foster carers for 3 years. They have been there everyday since Elliot was born and are honorary grandparents. I speak to them everyday and they\u2019re the first I call when I forget how to cook sausages lol. \nMy family are pressuring me to spend Christmas with them but things always go wrong and I\u2019m always the one that walks away crying. However when Christmas came around at my foster placement, there were no issues. Everyone was happy. Everyone was relaxed. Whereas things are always tense with my family. Everything has to be perfect. Everyone has to act perfect. And more often than not, I fall out with my sister (10f) and my mother always defends her. Favourite child stuff. I just want a peaceful Christmas, that\u2019s all I want. \nSo I made the decision that I\u2019ll be going back to my foster carers for Christmas. When I told my mother this, she immediately turned cold as she usually is and started guilt tripping me about how the family haven\u2019t spent a single Christmas with Elliot yet. My mother has never liked how Elliot is closer to my foster carers than he is to her and I understand that but I don\u2019t want to take that relationship between Elliot and my foster carers away. \nI talked to my aunt (mothers sister) about this and she told me not to stress about it, spend Christmas with whoever makes you happy. She understands how exhausting and mentally draining family events are. However I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m somehow in the wrong for choosing to spend Christmas with \u201cpeople who got paid to look after me\u201d (grandmothers words) instead of my actual family. \nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Go to where you and your child are comfortable and loved. Just because someone is \u201cblood\u201d doesn\u2019t make them family.", "NTA. OP, you may have been a difficult child, but your foster family gave you the love, attention  and guidance when you needed it that your biological relatives couldn\u2019t. Or wouldn\u2019t, who knows which.  Spend Christmas with the people who took care of you and who allow you to be happy.", "NTA    your foster family is your real family, from what you have written.

The perfect picture is the picture you're happy with.", "You're NTA. The foster carers are your extended family. You should spend Christmas with whomever you are most comfortable.\n\nAnd your grandmother needs a reality check. Your extended family obviously did a lot more than shelter you for money, as you still have a great relationship with them. And the elephant in the room is why were you in their care in the first place?

Go where you and your son are wanted and happy.", "NTA. Even if foster care somehow was a daycare service that people do for money (wtf???), I'd rather be with the people how \"got paid\" and just hang out when they're willing to do it for free, than be around people who can't do a good job even if they get paid for it\n\nMinimize contact with your biological family, it seems like they refuse to improve. Hopefully you can cut them out entirely, I'd rather just call the foster family my only family.", "Absolutely NTA. There must also have been a very good reason for you to have been put in foster care in the first place. I am so glad you had the good fortune to be placed with a good foster family, which unfortunately is not always a given. I should follow your aunts advice and spend the holidays with those who make you happy. Being a mother at the age of 19 is no picnic even at the best of times. You and your child need to stock up on good memories. Not memories of judgmental grandmothers, impossible expectations and general drama. There is such a thing as \"Wahlverwandtschaft\" (sp?) - meaning relationships of your chosing.", "NTA. Give yourself and your son a peaceful and happy holiday.  You don\u2019t owe your mother and grandmother anything, not even a relationship with Elliot.", "Your REAL family is who your heart chooses. Go where you are truly loved and treated well.\n\nDo you really want your son to have to deal with the bio family's BS? Kids know when things are off. Take him where he's loved for himself, not part of some perfect picture. Also, how long before grandmother starts making comments etc. to make him feel less than, for being born to a teenage mom....

Sounds to me like you \\*did\\* decide to spend Christmas with your family, as opposed to those merely related to you by blood.", "Nta for choosing a kinder experience and teaching your own son to value his own mental well being", "Nta.\nI wish I could bottle all the emotions I had as a foster parent from seeing/hearing about what bio family members did to their own kids and ten pour ot over their heads until they are a screaming, blubbering heap.\nGo to your Foster's. Let your bub soak up what family love is supposed to feel like. Your mom can go pound sand. \nI'm going to hug any of my kids that wander in to my kitchen today so hard. I love each one of them, tho I'm not bio dad. It's nearly Thanksgiving and they're all really underfoot because their bio parents are still questionable human beings. My wife doesn't bat an eye, just observes and loves them through it.\nI'm pretty sure we'll have a blanket fort and a Netflix marathon by the weekend with the kids that did go home to bio family for the holiday. Because somehow, the bio family folks still can't understand how not to be dysfunctional. Which means we'll have packed house for our traditional putting the Christmas tree up, decorating and having hot chocolate. Wife calls it post Thanksgiving triage. I just wish bio families would learn how to heal and stop hurting their kids. \nBut, you know what? I'm not sorry the kids all come over to our house and ignore their bio families. Because they choose to miss out on the awesome people their kids are and all the little moments of their lives that are shaping up to be important. I get those moments with my wife. We get to celebrate and share them all with the kids, creating memories they could have had if they'd cared enough to. Don't feel sorry for your mom. She made her choices.
