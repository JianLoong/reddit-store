He even had a tiny chair he drags around to do his mischief. \n\nMy sister said that it was okay, he has a right to his own home and he can do as he pleases while in there. I objected and told her he should also be the one to pick up after himself but she said it's okay and I dropped it. I just kept my stuff locked into my bags.\n\nWhen we went out to the mall though, my nephew would still go inside shops, pull things from their place and mess with all kinds of products. My sister never cleaned up after him and when I tried to do it instead, she would stop me and say that it's the employees' job. I disagreed with her and refused to enter any stores with them anymore, I would just wait outside to avoid the embarrassment. \n\nBut what finally broke the straw is when we went to the park and there's a part of the playground dedicated to older children like teenagers, one for kids school age, and one for toddlers/pre-school children. My nephew of course went to the teenager section and he climbed up this dangerous rack that's about 4.5 feet off the ground. \n\nI told my sister how this is a bad idea and it's really too much to spoil him like this and she snapped that it was none of my business and she's tired of me nagging her and she went and sat down. I was nervous and kept hovering around in case anything happens and BAM my nephew really lost his footing and was about to fall down. I catch him and put him safely to the ground. \n\nThat's when my sister comes growling at me what my fucking problem is. That he's fine and knows how to minimize the fall even if he falls and if she knew there was even a little danger she wouldn't have left him there. I yelled at her back that she was absolutely unhinged and that I've never seen parents like them ever before. \n\nShe screamed at me again to just leave and I was also fuming and left.

Boy are they going to have a nightmare on their hands as he gets older because he\u2019s already well on his way to being a menace. You protected a very young child from a fall that could have really hurt him and your sister yelled at you for it, she\u2019s awful. You keep your kids to the age appropriate areas in a playground like that because otherwise they tend to ruin everyone else\u2019s fun. Your sister is going to get quite the wake-up call when she tries to send a kid who has never been given the most basic of rules and boundaries to school. She\u2019s also going to flip her lid when he actually ruins something expensive in a store and she gets to pay for it. \nKids need boundaries and limits so that they can interact well with others and eventually become productive members of society. That poor kid is screaming for guidance through his actions and she\u2019s just blissfully ignoring everything he does. Every parent misses some stuff no matter how hard they try and we should all be understanding of that. Sometimes your kid will be cranky and you\u2019ll be exhausted and they will get into something before you realize it because nobody is perfect. Every kid will fall and get hurt sometimes because they all test boundaries and all parents have to live too, but those falls are mitigated when they\u2019re playing on age appropriate things and have some degree of supervision while they\u2019re learning something new. \nIt gets incredibly annoying as a parent to have so many people comment on every choice you make. It\u2019s nearly impossible to feel like you aren\u2019t a complete failure as a mom because everyone steps in to criticize you, especially when dads always get a pass just for showing up. Most of us still actually try though. She sounds like she\u2019s trying to justify some crazy new age parenting approach that is pretty much just pure laziness though and it\u2019s bordering on true neglect at this point. It\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s not even trying at home, but she\u2019s all but encouraging him to be destructive in public too. I love kids, but her behavior is what makes people absolutely hate children in general because she\u2019s encouraging entitled terror behavior from her toddler. Two year olds are hard, so hard, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse just giving up on parenting them at all. She still needs to guide him and help him understand his world and teach him expected behavior. That doesn\u2019t even end when they\u2019re almost adults because my licensed teenager will not be driving on New Year\u2019s Eve to and from an age-appropriate party because of the number of bars she\u2019ll have to pass and the number of drunk driving accidents that typically happen that night in our area. They still need guidance when they\u2019re applying to colleges and figuring out how to declare a major and that\u2019s what you sign up for as a parent rather than just standing by and watching everything around your child implode because you can\u2019t be bothered to help.", "NTA. I would never have watched my nephews or niece fall when they were little without trying to catch them or cushion the fall. In fact there's a play area in a Disney theme park where I hovered around because I thought it seemed too dangerous for one of my nephews who was 2 or 3. My sister said Oh don't worry, he'll be fine.

Example from experience- As a young adult (22 ish) i visited my sister and niblings who were 3 and 4.5. Niblings were both quite petite at the time, particularly from the vantage of say, a moving vehicle. Niblings were in my care while on scooters/bikes (sister was in the house dealing with an unexpected phone call). I insisted both wait with me at the stop sign. Elder nibling was furious, stating they knew to stop and could do it without me. I still insisted we stop as a group and did not let them go ahead. Not 3 seconds later, a painters van comes flying by. Niblings would have been pancaked by said van had I not insisted we stop as a group.\n\nElder nibling still complained to sister, who told me I could be the fun aunt instead of the rules aunt. She shut up when I told her that her permission to be the fun aunt wouldn't mean squat if the niblings were injured or killed while in my care because I trusted the niblings claims in their bid for independence.

Do you in your home but in public you act civilized. I can't believe she really allowed him to make a mess then said it's the employees job to clean up. TF is she thinking raising her kid like this. I'd be telling the family exactly what happened from shopping to the neglectful behavior at the playground. $10 says she'd be the first to sue when her kid gets hurt\ud83d\ude44", "My best mate raised her first son like this. I warned that when he was ready for school, the teachers wouldn't put up with his behaviour. She told me straight that all kids were the same. Well, turns out I was right. Within 2 weeks, the school were looking at expelling him. Took her another 6 years to get his behaviour under control. It's better to teach kids from the start, but she can't leave it too much longer. Your nephew will end up like my mates son. He is almost 30 now, and absolutely lovely, by the way!", "NTA- I have recurring nightmares of being paralyzed after being knocked down by someone's kid 'just being a kid' and running wild in a shop. I've had a few sprains avoiding them already. And I'm insured AF, I worry about the 80YOs they might knock over. Your sister is making a menace.", "NTA.  My sister was a bit like yours is with my youngest nephew.  He was born premature, spent a little over a month in the NICU so they indulged him.  That all changed when he was 4 after his dad let him and his older brother play outside in my driveway unsupervised (they were living with me at the time because their house had to undergo lead removal).  The youngest decided it would be cool to peel the clear coat off the hood of my car.  I discovered this after they had left to go to school (he was in pre-K).  I texted my sister informing her of what happened and, luckily for me, she was mortified.  My car is an '04 and the paint color is discontinued.  If we went through their insurance, they would have totaled my car.  After that my sister and BIL started cracking down on him and put more effort into teaching him to keep his hands to himself and not touch things that aren't his.  It was an *expensive* wake up call for them and my sister and BIL realized the implications of their and their son's actions.  If he'd done it in their neighborhood there are some unhinged neighbors that probably would have taken a shot at him.  Others would have hauled them to court and sued.  He is now six and understands that what might be okay in his own home *isn't* anywhere else and if people are visiting his house, he needs to leave their stuff alone or he loses access to his electronics and the tv. \n\nYour sister failing to discipline her child is going to result in a very expensive lesson for her.  If he breaks something in a store they're going to expect her to pay for it.  If she refuses, she could find herself with a set of shiny new bracelets and a lawsuit.\n\n>Should I have watched as the child fell and minded my own business?\n\nThis is a catch-22 situation for you because your sister sounds like the type to blame *you* if her child gets hurt.  She probably would have demanded to know why you didn't catch him when you realized he was going to fall so he wouldn't get hurt.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s fine for kids to explore.

Any adult has a responsibility to prevent a child from getting seriously hurt, if they can, even if the parents are incompetent. You did the kid a favor by calling out the sister and letting her know what will happen.\n\nThat kids is going to either hurt themself seriously or grow up to be an incel nice guy or both.

I call his mom my niece but she is my first cousin's daughter, my cousin and niece are the sweetest people I know, they just spoiled their son/grandson and let him have his way without disciplining him and let him have his way in whatever he wanted to do.", "NTA, don\u2019t worry, their terrible parenting will inevitably come back to bite them in the ass. This kid is going to be a nightmare of a teenager hahaha and his parents will deserve every last bit of what he dishes out to them.", "NTA.\n\nIn her own home it is fine if her kid is allowed to explore and break stuff.\n\nIn a shop, it is NOT fine for him to be breaking displays, and it is ridiculously entitled to expect employees to clean up after his trail of destruction. Strike 1.\n\nAt a playground, THERE ARE AGE LIMITS ON PLAY STRUCTURES FOR A REASON.\n\nIf her child goes off and plays on a structure that is not age-rated for him, and then injures himself, <that's her fault>. Strike 2.\n\nAnd then going off on you when you've actively prevented her child getting injured, because apparently humans who haven't developed a full range of mobility yet can control their own fall like cats? Strike 3.\n\n(Cats get injured from falls too, by the way!)\n\nIt goes beyond being irresponsible. At that point it's wilful negligence.", "Parenting is a difficult balancing act. A lot of people don't understand that and go with one extreme because they experienced the other themselves. Yes, it's good to let a toddler learn that falling hurts, but they should learn that safely. There's a huge difference between letting a pushy toddler that won't stop trying to touch a hot pan learn the lesson the hard way, and letting them have free access to the stove, fireplace, and fireworks, which sounds like the sister's technique. A lot of parents were yelled at and hit, so they think never correcting or disciplining is the answer. One has to teach kids respect, and boundaries, and manners. For example, if the kid destroys an expensive appliance, and there are no consequences for destruction of property and respecting other people's stuff when it's just the parents' belongings, how will the kid learn boundaries with anyone else? Teaching kids healthy boundaries is important, and that means teaching them autonomy, and respecting that of others and their property. Sometimes that means learning about things through empathy. Kid steals mom's bracelet, kid learns what it's like to lose something they love by having the parents take away a toy as a punishment. Kids need to learn when it's just their parents, or it will be learning it through the legal system. I'm not against gentle parenting. My mom always laid out rules and our expectations and what would happen if we didn't follow them. The kid is a small human, so that means they have to learn to follow rules before the consequences for breaking them are jail, or a broken neck, or lifelong health problems, or other things worse than a time out or no TV for a week. Now frankly, I think a lot of parents hover too much. Let you kid climb a tree, play with tools, and be outside, but not how this mom is doing it. Not in a way that will result in a bratty child that doesn't understand violation of property or following rules in their own house. That bit in the beginning about him being a little menace in his own home bothered me, because parents should be able to place and establish boundaries even with their own kids. If I spilled milk, my mom helped me clean it up, she didn't let me dance in it because it would  get everywhere, dry, get sticky, and attract bugs. I had to respect that I may have been allowed autonomy with my stuff, but that didn't mean I could leave them for my parents to trip over. Kids have to learn that their behavior affects others. If i yanked the cat's tail and the cat scratched me, for example, my mother used it as a teaching moment that the cat has boundaries and getting scratched is the consequence of not being gentle with the kitty. My parents told me I could draw whatever I wanted on paper, but if I wanted to draw on the walls of the house they were paying for, I should help with the mortgage. That's what every kid needs to hear. They are loved. Their actions affect others. They are people who's body and property deserve respect, and so are the bodies and property of everyone else. It's a balancing act. Teaching them there are no consequences results in brats. Teaching them with consequences that are too hard (either natural consequences like falling or punishment consequences like loss of privileges) and you're abusing the kid. You can't pick just one. You gotta balance both or your kid will wind up in either therapy, prison, or both. Kids are small humans, so teach them while the consequences are still small.", "NTA. That kid is going to be an unholy terror.", "NTA. They're raising a little nightmare and will learn to regret it.", "NTA. Give that part of your family a wide berth.

I ran over and managed to grab him under both arms - the car went straight by us without slowing down so the kid would have definitely been hit.\n\nKid started SCREECHING and the mother runs over yelling. Even after I explained what had happened, I apparently \"should have never put my hands on someone else's child.\"\n\nI told her if I hadn't \"put my hands on her child\" then the next hands to be on him that weren't hers would have been the paramedics as they put him in a body bag.", "Is was probably over barkmulch, pea gravel or something fairly safe. Still dumb and terrible parents though.", "Are you aware that winter looks very different all over the country and the world. And even in places where the temperature is closer to 40 degrees year around, people have outside parks. I thought the OP lives in Finland. Even then people go and play outside in cold temperatures all the time.", "Yeah, what\u2019s your point?", "Eh, I read it as several, not all. Plus I know when my kids will espouse broadly themed beliefs I often just like it as a support for the person, not necessarily 100% behind the thought. It's family.", "Yes, this child who could swim was certainly not doing so.", "They're just little humans who know a lot more than we give them credit for. The little dude was probably just doing an experiment to verify that the acceleration due to gravity aligns with Newton's results, like they were being taught in pre-school.", "They're little einsteins! They moonlight at NASA.", "It\u2019s winter, they are not at an outdoor playground, the playground they are at is inflatable, I have a 2 yo and that is what playgrounds are like now. Outdoor playgrounds today have rubber floors no more cement floors anyways. My 2 yo easily climbs 4-5 ft surfaces, playgrounds are made to accommodate safety these days. OP is childless, she does not know what the kid is capable of doing. OP specifically says she bagged for 3 days and hovered, she says it, there is more to this story", "So as a parent you never had a childless sister criticize your parenting? Is there nothing about this post that sounds over exaggerated? Would you want your sister calling CPS if she disagrees with how you parent?", "And the rest of it? Tearing up people\u2019s homes, stores? And playgrounds are separated by age for a reason. If this area is meant for older kids it\u2019s not where he should be. Besides being for kids that are larger and different abilities, he could get hurt because the bigger kids wouldn\u2019t be expecting him to be there. \n\nWe just don\u2019t agree and that\u2019s okay. You do you. I have a 22 year old and a 13 year old. I also have a degree in early childhood education. I think OP\u2019s sister is a lazy and somewhat negligent parent. Letting them explore what they\u2019re capable of isn\u2019t the same thing as sitting by while he falls off a play structure or destroys a store.", "I never said I thought she should call CPS. You said that. I was asking you what you meant by saying that the child is only two.", "There are 2 sides to every story and then there is the truth, there is more to this story, we need the sister\u2019s side. When I was young I criticized my sister\u2019s parenting because we weren\u2019t raised that way and now that I am a parent I recognize that she did an amazing job, there is more to this story", "You expect a 2 year old to be perfectly behaved for 3 days straight? And from the perspective of a childless person?", "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re so invested in my opinion but I\u2019m not going to debate this with you. Have a great new year!", "NTA - you were protecting your nephew from very real harm.  And they way they\u2019re allowing him to behave in public is atrocious. They will soon regret the way they\u2019re allowing him to behave.  Let them suffer through it on their own. Avoid going out in public with them in the meantime.", "Mmmmm... INFO. I reserve judgement on this. I know first hand how people without children have lots judgements and ideals about what they would do if they were parents. Most of time they are unrealistic and born out of ignorance. I also know that the childless can be especially critical of other family members who are parents. Without hearing your sister's side and/or knowing whether you are the kind of person to embellish or exaggerate things, I'm not so quick to assume Y Aren't TA.\n\nIf your nephew was truly in danger, then that's great that you were there to make sure he didn't get hurt. Otherwise, my advice is that you just stay away from your sister for a while if you don't care for the way she parents. At least until you think you can be present to just be her sister and not her critic.", "My friend broke his arm when he fell off of one of those red plastic slides for you house indoors! So ummm yeah he coulda hurt himself! Good uncle! Terrible parents! Hope that kid makes it to adulthood have a feeling it\u2019s gonna be him raising himself!", "NTA.  Your sister and bil are though. Children need to be taught from a young age, everything from reminding them to say please and thank you,  to helping them to tidy up the toys when playtime is over, small  simple explanations \" ok, it's bathtime so let's put the toys back in the box\" then help them to do it. When in public in a store, take their hand and if they try to pick something up especially something breakable a gentle \" no we don't need one of those so let's go look for the things we need, can you help me find some bananas/ milk etc\"\n\nSame with teaching them to be safe, like don't go near the cooker it's very hot (I used to put my hand close to the stove and say ouch ouch burny and pull my hand away as if I'd hurt myself) \n\nIf they don't teach thier child now, they are in for a world of trouble heading thier way.", "Wow. NTA but damn they are going to be in for a shock when he goes to school. I predict he will be pulled for home schooling pretty quickly as \"public education stifles my child's creativity and free will.\"\n\nYes 2 year olds do need some freedom to explore their world  as do children at every age but the parents job is to give the child safe boundaries and instill clear behavior expectations at each age level.", "NTA. Who let's ANY child fall if they are able to catch them to prevent possible harm? It's going to backfire when they are no longer allowed in certain places or worst case scenario that the child is injured. They will have to answer cps.", "NTA \n\nShe can do that in her own home!\n\nShe can also let him fall. There is a lot of evidence saying kids need to fall, take risks to learn how to navigate a path in life! Keeping kids in a bubble does them no good later in life. A 4 foot fall isn\u2019t much for a toddler especially when most parks have spongey bottoms. But I can\u2019t judge the fall height. \n\nI do have a massive issue with parents that let kids run amok in shops! I mean control you kid in public. \n\nSo I see your point and see your sisters! Kids are tiny humans that do know more than we give them credit for BUT we also need to keep them reasonably safe and set some boundaries as they can learn how to behave outside the home", "NTA- that is a big, and potentially dangerous fall, and she shouldn't let him wreck stuff in public for sure. Also kind of cracking up at the \"little chair for mischief\" comment. Little shit. Lol.", "Like if you are watching my kid, you are watching my kid. I'm not there to make those choices, but I sure as fuck don't believe in undermining the authority of another trusted adult. I 100% trust you to make those choices as I trust you with my child. Sorry for the rant.", "Some do, you can learn it in like gymnastics or parkour. Do I believe the kid knows how? Absolutely not.\n\nDoes mom care? Nope.\n\nThis is a recipe for disaster.", "Same energy as the one mother that didn't pay attention to her kid until she seen her 4 yr old 40ft up in the air climbing a spruce tree. She also thought that locking him in his car seat in the house for an hour or two while he screamed bloody murder was a good punishment.", "Personally just respond with\n\n\u201cFine I\u2019ll stay out of it. But once your child starts school and is force to adhere to societal rules, don\u2019t come crying to me. Especially once the school sees bumps and bruises all over him and calls CPS for wellness checks.\u201d", "NTA.  This poor kid doesn't have a chance.", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right that by not teaching her son boundaries he will act out in public. Going into stores and not cleaning up after your child is disrespectful and teaches your child to not respect people or things that don\u2019t belong to you. Lastly, allowing a two year old to play on items not recommended for their age group is highly neglectful. Had he gotten injured, her story would\u2019ve changed immediately.", "NTA... If the child survives childhood it will be a menace to society. Its not store keepers jobs to clean up after kids that are misbehaving. Don't have them to your house.", "NTA reply in the group chat \"next time your son is going to take a 5 foot fall, I will go ahead and let him get hurt like you want me to.\"", "joy duggar, is that you?", "NTA!\n\nTwo things regarding the playground:\n\n1. I fell on a playground once. Only a couple of feet, but I landed on my back and neck in a bad way, which caused injuries that weren\u2019t fully and properly identified for YEARS because they needed to be viewed with an MRI, not an X-ray. My spine is literally deformed now in two places because of that fall. I\u2019m in constant pain, I needed a walker by age 37, and there is no cure; it will just get worse forever. To purposely not catch him would be cruel.\n\n2. It\u2019s a pet peeve of mine when people let toddlers play on the big kid equipment because it often ends with parents of toddlers complaining about big kids playing as it makes their little ones unsafe. Big kids deserve a safe, fun place to play too. \n\nYour sister is lucky her son didn\u2019t get seriously injured.", "Gosh some people lose their damn marbles when they have kids.  Every new parenting fad seems to top the last. NTA.", "NTA for catching him from falling.  I have a 2 year old and he also carries a chair around with him to get up to all the places he shouldn't and sometimes it is cute but annoying and sometimes it crosses the line to dangerous and that is when the hard stop happens.  The store thing is really rude and I am with you there 100% and letting him climb unsafe places unsupervised at the park is scary and irresponsible.", "This, also a bad fall can leave a small child seriously injured. Nta", "Put a link of this post in the group chat and let them read the response. Nta\n\nI am social worker if the child would\u2019ve hurt himself the hospital may have called is and we would be obligated to do an investigation.\n\nFurthermore her parenting style if faulty. Yes children are little humans who need to be taught. Brains literally are not developed.", "Two year olds know how to fall?  My four year old fell once from a slightly lesser height.  Result was a broken humerus.  He didn't know how to minimise his fall.\n\nYou also never know whether other factors might be at play.  It turns out that his joints overextend.  If they didn't, he wouldn't have broken his arm, because it would have folded the right way.\n\nFurther result was surgery to re-break it and pin it a couple of years later because it healed wrong, then more surgery a few months later to take the pins out, and a big scar on his arm.", "Put a link of this post in the group chat and let them read the response.
