{"id": 6094, "submission_id": "zzt31o", "title": "AITA for catching my little nephew when he was about to fall and 'interfering' with my sister's parenting?", "selftext": "I finally visited my older sister after a year of not seeing each other and I was shocked with the way she and her husband were treating my 2yo nephew. \n\nOn the first day I got there, I noticed that my little nephew was literally wrecking the house and none of his parents would say anything. He even had a tiny chair he drags around to do his mischief. \n\nMy sister said that it was okay, he has a right to his own home and he can do as he pleases while in there. I objected and told her he should also be the one to pick up after himself but she said it's okay and I dropped it. I just kept my stuff locked into my bags.\n\nWhen we went out to the mall though, my nephew would still go inside shops, pull things from their place and mess with all kinds of products. My sister never cleaned up after him and when I tried to do it instead, she would stop me and say that it's the employees' job. I disagreed with her and refused to enter any stores with them anymore, I would just wait outside to avoid the embarrassment. \n\nBut what finally broke the straw is when we went to the park and there's a part of the playground dedicated to older children like teenagers, one for kids school age, and one for toddlers/pre-school children. My nephew of course went to the teenager section and he climbed up this dangerous rack that's about 4.5 feet off the ground. \n\nI told my sister how this is a bad idea and it's really too much to spoil him like this and she snapped that it was none of my business and she's tired of me nagging her and she went and sat down. I was nervous and kept hovering around in case anything happens and BAM my nephew really lost his footing and was about to fall down. I catch him and put him safely to the ground. \n\nThat's when my sister comes growling at me what my fucking problem is. That he's fine and knows how to minimize the fall even if he falls and if she knew there was even a little danger she wouldn't have left him there. I yelled at her back that she was absolutely unhinged and that I've never seen parents like them ever before. \n\nShe screamed at me again to just leave and I was also fuming and left. My belongings were still at their house so I went there and told my brother in law to please get them for me. He asked me what was going on when he handed them over and I told him he should hear about it from my sister and left. \n\nLater, my brother in law (and sister as they were using we) sent this super long message in the family group chat stating how children are just tiny humans and know a lot more than we give them credit for...etc etc with a rolling eyes emoji at the end. \n\nSeveral members liked that message and I don't know.

The fact that he doesn\u2019t clean up after himself, they let him to anything he wants even in shops and disturb the people who work there is unacceptable. Bad bad parenting, in 10 years they\u2019re going to regret it", "NTA, is your sister for real? There are certain things where you have to leave kids figure things out for themselves. None of those involve the kid injuring themselves like your sister would suggest. They are not tiny humans, they are young humans and simply don't know what they should and shouldn't do, what's dangerous and what isn't etc. etc. and it's up to your sister to educate their child on basic rules, concepts, dangers and decency but isn't", "Yikes! I don't know where you live, but in the U.S., you could always call child protective services to investigate. There is certainly a wee bit of independent play you want a child to have, but not to the point where they can injure themselves. NTA, and thank you for watching out for your nephew!", "NTA. \n\nYou now know from here on out, to leave them be and whatever happens, happens. You don\u2019t need to have children of your own to know that a child shouldn\u2019t play with fire, or shouldn\u2019t jump off of obstacles that are obviously meant for kids 6 or 7x his age. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t catch him, your sister would have complained that you were standing right there and allowed him to get injured.", "NTA from stopping him falling.\n\nShe's completely wrong that 2 year olds know how to fall.\n\nIt sounds like your sister has been reading the wrong parenting books - letting children be destructive with no gentle instruction to clean up after ourselves us going to be  big issue for her as he grows up.\n\nParenting is hard and people get a lot of conflicting advice. But she should not be leaving a mess for service personnel to clean up everywhere they go. And nor should she be neglecting him when he us about to injure himself.", "NTA for catching him; sounds like you avoided him getting hurt. \n\nSounds like he needs some discipline at home as well but it\u2019s not your place to comment on that IMO", "NTA but your sister and her husband are being absolutely terrible parents. Boy are they going to have a nightmare on their hands as he gets older because he\u2019s already well on his way to being a menace. You protected a very young child from a fall that could have really hurt him and your sister yelled at you for it, she\u2019s awful. You keep your kids to the age appropriate areas in a playground like that because otherwise they tend to ruin everyone else\u2019s fun. Your sister is going to get quite the wake-up call when she tries to send a kid who has never been given the most basic of rules and boundaries to school. She\u2019s also going to flip her lid when he actually ruins something expensive in a store and she gets to pay for it. \nKids need boundaries and limits so that they can interact well with others and eventually become productive members of society. That poor kid is screaming for guidance through his actions and she\u2019s just blissfully ignoring everything he does. Every parent misses some stuff no matter how hard they try and we should all be understanding of that. Sometimes your kid will be cranky and you\u2019ll be exhausted and they will get into something before you realize it because nobody is perfect. Every kid will fall and get hurt sometimes because they all test boundaries and all parents have to live too, but those falls are mitigated when they\u2019re playing on age appropriate things and have some degree of supervision while they\u2019re learning something new. \nIt gets incredibly annoying as a parent to have so many people comment on every choice you make. It\u2019s nearly impossible to feel like you aren\u2019t a complete failure as a mom because everyone steps in to criticize you, especially when dads always get a pass just for showing up. Most of us still actually try though. She sounds like she\u2019s trying to justify some crazy new age parenting approach that is pretty much just pure laziness though and it\u2019s bordering on true neglect at this point. It\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s not even trying at home, but she\u2019s all but encouraging him to be destructive in public too. I love kids, but her behavior is what makes people absolutely hate children in general because she\u2019s encouraging entitled terror behavior from her toddler. Two year olds are hard, so hard, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse just giving up on parenting them at all. She still needs to guide him and help him understand his world and teach him expected behavior. That doesn\u2019t even end when they\u2019re almost adults because my licensed teenager will not be driving on New Year\u2019s Eve to and from an age-appropriate party because of the number of bars she\u2019ll have to pass and the number of drunk driving accidents that typically happen that night in our area. They still need guidance when they\u2019re applying to colleges and figuring out how to declare a major and that\u2019s what you sign up for as a parent rather than just standing by and watching everything around your child implode because you can\u2019t be bothered to help.", "NTA. I would never have watched my nephews or niece fall when they were little without trying to catch them or cushion the fall. In fact there's a play area in a Disney theme park where I hovered around because I thought it seemed too dangerous for one of my nephews who was 2 or 3. My sister said Oh don't worry, he'll be fine. He fell and I caught him. But I got a thank you.", "NTA. But the child is raised to being a huge asshole by an asshole (your sister).", "> Should I have watched as the child fell and minded my own business?\n\nEven if he were not really in danger and you did overreact, so what? \n\nNTA. You did good. Wanting your nephew to be safe is hardly an asshole move.", "Is this the new trend in parenting?

It helps build confidence. The thing is though...it's always a controlled risk, and a risk is different from a dangerous hazard. They play on structures designed with their age group in mind. I am not hovering, saying 'be careful!' every twenty seconds, but I am close and engaged. Your sister is taking a reasonable philosophy and seemingly using it to abdicate responsibility and avoid teaching her child. This isn't even touching on how disrespectful it is to allow a child to make a mess in a public place and expecting employees to clean up after the kid. \n\nSo no, I don't think you were the asshole for not allowing your nephew to injure himself or for objecting to how they treat store employees and later distancing yourself.", "ESH (except the brother)\n\nShe is too negligent.

It\u2019s easy to look at a situation and think \u201cI would never\u201d. The whole first part of the description didn\u2019t sound like safety issues, so yeah she can raise her child how she wants.
