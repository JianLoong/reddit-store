He even had a tiny chair he drags around to do his mischief. \n\nMy sister said that it was okay, he has a right to his own home and he can do as he pleases while in there. I objected and told her he should also be the one to pick up after himself but she said it's okay and I dropped it. I just kept my stuff locked into my bags.\n\nWhen we went out to the mall though, my nephew would still go inside shops, pull things from their place and mess with all kinds of products. My sister never cleaned up after him and when I tried to do it instead, she would stop me and say that it's the employees' job. I disagreed with her and refused to enter any stores with them anymore, I would just wait outside to avoid the embarrassment. \n\nBut what finally broke the straw is when we went to the park and there's a part of the playground dedicated to older children like teenagers, one for kids school age, and one for toddlers/pre-school children. My nephew of course went to the teenager section and he climbed up this dangerous rack that's about 4.5 feet off the ground. \n\nI told my sister how this is a bad idea and it's really too much to spoil him like this and she snapped that it was none of my business and she's tired of me nagging her and she went and sat down. I was nervous and kept hovering around in case anything happens and BAM my nephew really lost his footing and was about to fall down. I catch him and put him safely to the ground. \n\nThat's when my sister comes growling at me what my fucking problem is. That he's fine and knows how to minimize the fall even if he falls and if she knew there was even a little danger she wouldn't have left him there. I yelled at her back that she was absolutely unhinged and that I've never seen parents like them ever before. \n\nShe screamed at me again to just leave and I was also fuming and left.

Boy are they going to have a nightmare on their hands as he gets older because he\u2019s already well on his way to being a menace. You protected a very young child from a fall that could have really hurt him and your sister yelled at you for it, she\u2019s awful. You keep your kids to the age appropriate areas in a playground like that because otherwise they tend to ruin everyone else\u2019s fun. Your sister is going to get quite the wake-up call when she tries to send a kid who has never been given the most basic of rules and boundaries to school. She\u2019s also going to flip her lid when he actually ruins something expensive in a store and she gets to pay for it. \nKids need boundaries and limits so that they can interact well with others and eventually become productive members of society. That poor kid is screaming for guidance through his actions and she\u2019s just blissfully ignoring everything he does. Every parent misses some stuff no matter how hard they try and we should all be understanding of that. Sometimes your kid will be cranky and you\u2019ll be exhausted and they will get into something before you realize it because nobody is perfect. Every kid will fall and get hurt sometimes because they all test boundaries and all parents have to live too, but those falls are mitigated when they\u2019re playing on age appropriate things and have some degree of supervision while they\u2019re learning something new. \nIt gets incredibly annoying as a parent to have so many people comment on every choice you make. It\u2019s nearly impossible to feel like you aren\u2019t a complete failure as a mom because everyone steps in to criticize you, especially when dads always get a pass just for showing up. Most of us still actually try though. She sounds like she\u2019s trying to justify some crazy new age parenting approach that is pretty much just pure laziness though and it\u2019s bordering on true neglect at this point. It\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s not even trying at home, but she\u2019s all but encouraging him to be destructive in public too. I love kids, but her behavior is what makes people absolutely hate children in general because she\u2019s encouraging entitled terror behavior from her toddler. Two year olds are hard, so hard, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse just giving up on parenting them at all. She still needs to guide him and help him understand his world and teach him expected behavior. That doesn\u2019t even end when they\u2019re almost adults because my licensed teenager will not be driving on New Year\u2019s Eve to and from an age-appropriate party because of the number of bars she\u2019ll have to pass and the number of drunk driving accidents that typically happen that night in our area. They still need guidance when they\u2019re applying to colleges and figuring out how to declare a major and that\u2019s what you sign up for as a parent rather than just standing by and watching everything around your child implode because you can\u2019t be bothered to help.", "NTA. I would never have watched my nephews or niece fall when they were little without trying to catch them or cushion the fall. In fact there's a play area in a Disney theme park where I hovered around because I thought it seemed too dangerous for one of my nephews who was 2 or 3. My sister said Oh don't worry, he'll be fine.

Example from experience- As a young adult (22 ish) i visited my sister and niblings who were 3 and 4.5. Niblings were both quite petite at the time, particularly from the vantage of say, a moving vehicle. Niblings were in my care while on scooters/bikes (sister was in the house dealing with an unexpected phone call). I insisted both wait with me at the stop sign. Elder nibling was furious, stating they knew to stop and could do it without me. I still insisted we stop as a group and did not let them go ahead. Not 3 seconds later, a painters van comes flying by. Niblings would have been pancaked by said van had I not insisted we stop as a group.\n\nElder nibling still complained to sister, who told me I could be the fun aunt instead of the rules aunt. She shut up when I told her that her permission to be the fun aunt wouldn't mean squat if the niblings were injured or killed while in my care because I trusted the niblings claims in their bid for independence.

Do you in your home but in public you act civilized. I can't believe she really allowed him to make a mess then said it's the employees job to clean up. TF is she thinking raising her kid like this. I'd be telling the family exactly what happened from shopping to the neglectful behavior at the playground. $10 says she'd be the first to sue when her kid gets hurt\ud83d\ude44", "My best mate raised her first son like this. I warned that when he was ready for school, the teachers wouldn't put up with his behaviour. She told me straight that all kids were the same. Well, turns out I was right. Within 2 weeks, the school were looking at expelling him. Took her another 6 years to get his behaviour under control. It's better to teach kids from the start, but she can't leave it too much longer. Your nephew will end up like my mates son. He is almost 30 now, and absolutely lovely, by the way!", "NTA- I have recurring nightmares of being paralyzed after being knocked down by someone's kid 'just being a kid' and running wild in a shop. I've had a few sprains avoiding them already. And I'm insured AF, I worry about the 80YOs they might knock over. Your sister is making a menace.", "NTA.  My sister was a bit like yours is with my youngest nephew.  He was born premature, spent a little over a month in the NICU so they indulged him.  That all changed when he was 4 after his dad let him and his older brother play outside in my driveway unsupervised (they were living with me at the time because their house had to undergo lead removal).  The youngest decided it would be cool to peel the clear coat off the hood of my car.  I discovered this after they had left to go to school (he was in pre-K).  I texted my sister informing her of what happened and, luckily for me, she was mortified.  My car is an '04 and the paint color is discontinued.  If we went through their insurance, they would have totaled my car.  After that my sister and BIL started cracking down on him and put more effort into teaching him to keep his hands to himself and not touch things that aren't his.  It was an *expensive* wake up call for them and my sister and BIL realized the implications of their and their son's actions.  If he'd done it in their neighborhood there are some unhinged neighbors that probably would have taken a shot at him.  Others would have hauled them to court and sued.  He is now six and understands that what might be okay in his own home *isn't* anywhere else and if people are visiting his house, he needs to leave their stuff alone or he loses access to his electronics and the tv. \n\nYour sister failing to discipline her child is going to result in a very expensive lesson for her.  If he breaks something in a store they're going to expect her to pay for it.  If she refuses, she could find herself with a set of shiny new bracelets and a lawsuit.\n\n>Should I have watched as the child fell and minded my own business?\n\nThis is a catch-22 situation for you because your sister sounds like the type to blame *you* if her child gets hurt.  She probably would have demanded to know why you didn't catch him when you realized he was going to fall so he wouldn't get hurt.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s fine for kids to explore. It\u2019s not okay to be destructive. Your sister and her husband are HORRIBLE parents and they need to be told. Animals know how to walk and hunt young but your nephew isn\u2019t a wild animal (well he\u2019s acting like it). Kids don\u2019t know how to fall that\u2019s why they cry like banshees. Your sister is unhinged and I would tell the whole family what she\u2019s doing. But I\u2019m petty.", "Next time let him fall and report her as negligent. She\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA. Cheer up. This approach to parenting is definitely going to come back to bite her in the ass, even if it takes a while.\n\nSadly, it will also hurt your nephew whether it\u2019s coming to physical harm, not having friends or landing him in jail. Unfortunately, there really isn\u2019t anything you can do about it.", "You didn't interfere with their parenting. To do so requires some parenting to start with and there is none here. \n\nThe child is feral. Not his fault and a two year old doesn't deserve a fractured skull to p\\[rove your point so you did absolutely the right thing catching him. Unfortunately by the time he gets to school they will find feral doesn't work for most people. NTA.", "Of course if he did fall and hurt himself I'm sure op would be blamed. Next time if ever just let it be if he hurts himself that's on them. I can see the future for that kid and it's not pretty", "NTA But. your sister and BIL need to shadow an ER doc and see how many kids end up with serious injuries even with proper supervision.", "NTA.  Any adult has a responsibility to prevent a child from getting seriously hurt, if they can, even if the parents are incompetent. You did the kid a favor by calling out the sister and letting her know what will happen.\n\nThat kids is going to either hurt themself seriously or grow up to be an incel nice guy or both. I feel sorry for kids when they have incompetent parents and no one calls the parents out.\n\nBy the way, I especially despise people who make messes in restaurants and stores and say it is the employee's jobs to clean up.", "A fall from that height can cause internal organs to be damaged. You can literally reply back that you will never apologize for catching your nephew as he fell from almost 5 feet. And that their neglect is not admirable. It\u2019s dangerous.", "NTA. Were you supposed to let him fall and crack his head open/break his spine/legs, etc., leaving him dead or permanently paralyzed? You literally may have saved his life. Your sister should be thanking you, not screaming at you. She sounds too foolish and irresponsible (to put it mildly) to be a suitable parent.", "NTA. And I would reply back that nephew fell from a 4.5 foot height on a playground and nearly got seriously injured and you were yelled at. For saving him from serious injury.", "NTA\n\nMy niece came to visit me with her 3 year old (at the time) son, holy hell, her 3 year old was a terror and I am being kind when I say that. I reached a point where I told her she needs to set boundaries on his behavior now before he acts up worse, that he would cause problems once her son started school, at the time I worked at a preschool and had seen some kids with this behavior causing chaos in the classroom because they refused to follow rules.\n\nMy niece told me the school would call her if son acted up, I told her that if the school called her it would be after her son's behavior had been too much. Obviously she ignored what I said, one day she called me crying because her son was suspended for a week from school for slamming a classmate's face into a brick wall, her son was in Kindergarten at that time.\n\nI live in California, they live in Michigan, her son is now twenty something years old and is not someone I would want in my life, his behavior hasn't improved and I am so glad we live far apart from each other. I call his mom my niece but she is my first cousin's daughter, my cousin and niece are the sweetest people I know, they just spoiled their son/grandson and let him have his way without disciplining him and let him have his way in whatever he wanted to do.", "NTA, don\u2019t worry, their terrible parenting will inevitably come back to bite them in the ass. This kid is going to be a nightmare of a teenager hahaha and his parents will deserve every last bit of what he dishes out to them.", "NTA.\n\nIn her own home it is fine if her kid is allowed to explore and break stuff.\n\nIn a shop, it is NOT fine for him to be breaking displays, and it is ridiculously entitled to expect employees to clean up after his trail of destruction. Strike 1.\n\nAt a playground, THERE ARE AGE LIMITS ON PLAY STRUCTURES FOR A REASON.\n\nIf her child goes off and plays on a structure that is not age-rated for him, and then injures himself, <that's her fault>. Strike 2.\n\nAnd then going off on you when you've actively prevented her child getting injured, because apparently humans who haven't developed a full range of mobility yet can control their own fall like cats? Strike 3.\n\n(Cats get injured from falls too, by the way!)\n\nIt goes beyond being irresponsible. At that point it's wilful negligence.", "Parenting is a difficult balancing act. A lot of people don't understand that and go with one extreme because they experienced the other themselves. Yes, it's good to let a toddler learn that falling hurts, but they should learn that safely. There's a huge difference between letting a pushy toddler that won't stop trying to touch a hot pan learn the lesson the hard way, and letting them have free access to the stove, fireplace, and fireworks, which sounds like the sister's technique. A lot of parents were yelled at and hit, so they think never correcting or disciplining is the answer. One has to teach kids respect, and boundaries, and manners. For example, if the kid destroys an expensive appliance, and there are no consequences for destruction of property and respecting other people's stuff when it's just the parents' belongings, how will the kid learn boundaries with anyone else? Teaching kids healthy boundaries is important, and that means teaching them autonomy, and respecting that of others and their property. Sometimes that means learning about things through empathy. Kid steals mom's bracelet, kid learns what it's like to lose something they love by having the parents take away a toy as a punishment. Kids need to learn when it's just their parents, or it will be learning it through the legal system. I'm not against gentle parenting. My mom always laid out rules and our expectations and what would happen if we didn't follow them. The kid is a small human, so that means they have to learn to follow rules before the consequences for breaking them are jail, or a broken neck, or lifelong health problems, or other things worse than a time out or no TV for a week. Now frankly, I think a lot of parents hover too much. Let you kid climb a tree, play with tools, and be outside, but not how this mom is doing it. Not in a way that will result in a bratty child that doesn't understand violation of property or following rules in their own house. That bit in the beginning about him being a little menace in his own home bothered me, because parents should be able to place and establish boundaries even with their own kids. If I spilled milk, my mom helped me clean it up, she didn't let me dance in it because it would  get everywhere, dry, get sticky, and attract bugs. I had to respect that I may have been allowed autonomy with my stuff, but that didn't mean I could leave them for my parents to trip over. Kids have to learn that their behavior affects others. If i yanked the cat's tail and the cat scratched me, for example, my mother used it as a teaching moment that the cat has boundaries and getting scratched is the consequence of not being gentle with the kitty. My parents told me I could draw whatever I wanted on paper, but if I wanted to draw on the walls of the house they were paying for, I should help with the mortgage. That's what every kid needs to hear. They are loved. Their actions affect others. They are people who's body and property deserve respect, and so are the bodies and property of everyone else. It's a balancing act. Teaching them there are no consequences results in brats. Teaching them with consequences that are too hard (either natural consequences like falling or punishment consequences like loss of privileges) and you're abusing the kid. You can't pick just one. You gotta balance both or your kid will wind up in either therapy, prison, or both. Kids are small humans, so teach them while the consequences are still small.", "NTA. That kid is going to be an unholy terror.", "NTA. They're raising a little nightmare and will learn to regret it.", "NTA. Give that part of your family a wide berth. Nothing good is going to come from that.", "I used to work in a coffee shop and I remember feeling my soul wither when a sweet little boy of probably 3 started cleaning up his mess from a table one day and his dad stopped him and said, \"there's people whose job is to do that.\" \ud83d\ude23", "More like  no parenting  at all, just present  as a body  so he us not completely  alone .

We gave him a bit more leeway and he got worse. \n\nWe thought about it, and corralled him back in. He settled right down. We call it putting edges on the square. Kids can bumble about in their virtual square knowing they can't go too far or get too crazy. That they are cared for.

Kid sounds like he\u2019s making lots of messes in their home and there\u2019s no discipline.", "OP should call CPS anyway and make a report for child neglect and endangerment. \n\nEven if nothing is done now, at least CPS will have a record of the event. Then it will at least corroborate any future reports made by teachers, hospital staff, etc. (assuming the neglect continues)", "Right? I have a  4.5 yo and a 3 yo.
