I bought it when I was 23 after letting my business partner take our shared assets in exchange for 600k. we owned a few properties together since we had bought our first place at 20 and 21 back when we were dating and even though we didn't work out we stayed in business together. I closed on my house a few months after my 23rd birthday. I had only been working part-time while I was managing our properties so aside from my bed and some little things from my apartment I stayed in my house for months while it was basically empty. I had always wanted to be a pastry chef and a local community college has a program that lets you get your certificate in almost anything for free with just 16 weeks of classes and if you choose to continue afterward your credits will roll over. That's where I met my fiance James (M27). James was a chef at a high-end restaurant. He had been working since 16 he started as a busser and worked his way up. While he had a lot of experience, he wanted to have a degree to back it up. We hit it off pretty quickly, he even taught me how to drive, helped me develop recipes, and helped me pick out the perfect spot to put my bakery. He proposed to me in Jamaica on August 8th, 2022. When we got back home I moved in with him. I've been perfecting recipes in my house as I had taken the time to make the kitchen to my liking. I tend to put my phone on DnD just to make sure I have no distractions. There have been a few times when I have missed calls from James and I see that it really bothers him but it's not like I go at random times I have a set schedule and I rarely go off of it.  About a week ago I finished baking quite early and ended up taking a nap my phone was still on DnD and I woke up to James banging on the door.  He told me he had been calling me for hours.  I told him I had forgotten to take my phone off DnD. He suggested that if he should have a key he could use for emergencies or in case something like this happened again. I said no because this is my safe space and I'm still adjusting to living with someone. The other day when I finished baking I noticed it was raining and I decided to call James because I don't feel comfortable driving in the rain. He didn't call me when he got here he knocked on the door and when I opened it he complained about getting wet while waiting for me and said he wouldn't have to wait if he had a key. I pointed out that he could've called me and I would've just come to the car. he said that wasn't the point and me not giving him a key was a slap in face. Yesterday I noticed he had one of those \"minute keys\" in his glove compartment while looking for my lipgloss I left in his car I immediately knew what he did and called my brother to help me change the locks, last night at dinner I let him know I found the key and told him it wouldn't be on any use as I had changed the locks.

You just have some weird hangup about your house.\n\nIn fairness, I don't think your fiance taking the key when you clearly told him not to make a copy is right, either. That was wrong on his part.

Gtfo with that. He needs to trust you, and he clearly doesn't. \n\nThe stealing your key and copying it without your permission is just the icing on the cake. NTA.", "NTA. Your instinct to not give him a key was correct. He proved you right by going behind your back and making a copy of the key.", "NTA you needing to answer the phone when he calls or he flys off the deep end says you have bigger issues than the key\n\nKeep your safe space", "NTA it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t trust him you just want your own space. Wanting a escape pod and hideaway isn\u2019t bad. If I don\u2019t want to give my house key away because I want my own space doesn\u2019t make me a jerk. Trust issues would be not feeling safe with him, thinking he was cheating, or not allowing him in your spaces when you want to. Like if you hid your house for example. This is just a boundary thing. Tell him your not ready to get rid of all your boundaries yet and you may never. He has to respect that or leave. He can\u2019t control you or force you to do something. It was for sure a jerky move to steal a key. This proved you were right to set a boundary because he doesn\u2019t respect your agency. Anyway good luck your life story is awesome!! Having all that wealth at young age is so cool!! And you earned it!", "Nta- he took something that wasn't his after permission was denied.

This, to me, would be a major RED FLAG.\n\nEDIT: \"When we got back home I moved in with him\" - this is also a huge RED FLAG! I totally missed this tiny little statement. You need to sit down together and have a serious discussion about your living arrangements. I fail to understand why you are entitled to access to his place and not also vice versa. Not very sharing and caring, are you, OP. YTA.", "NTA  no means no", "NTA because he did it against your wishes and behind your back. I have to say his demands that you be available at anytime he wishes and the sneaking a key seem like giant red flags to me. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure based on your lack of trust on both sides, if you are really ready to be In a relationship this far advanced?", "NTA.\n\nThat is a GIANT red flag. Do not ignore it.\n\nETA: Dynamics of the relationship aside, whether or not OP\u2019s reason for refusing to give him a key is justified, this is a breach of trust to be told no and then just go and sneakily have a copy cut.", "YTA -- who needs a \"safe space\" from their fianc\u00e9?  I can understand where he sees that as a slap in the face.", "Nta. That is a breach of trust. Be wary.", "NTA that\u2019s your private space, you explained to him very clearly why you needed it, and he\u2019s violating the shit out of your boundaries.", "Info - can you explain why you need a \"safe space\" that your fiance can't access?", "YTA.\n\nMove the fuck out of his house if you want a safe space. You are whole bunch of crazy to think it\u2019s okay that he isn\u2019t allowed a key to a place that HE OWNS AND LIVES AT.\n\nEdit: so this this is for her other home. Misread the Posts/comments. But I still think OP is an asshole and someone who isn\u2019t ready for a relationship. If she can\u2019t trust her fianc\u00e9 to have access to her home, than she isn\u2019t ready to be with him for the rest of her life.", "NTA - this relationship won't work", "Don't marry him.", "The issue isn't if someone is an AH. The issue is that you aren't ready for the relationship you are in. He wants unrestricted access to you at all times, and you want privacy and space. To me, he sounds creepy and pushy, and you sound distant and like you aren't all in. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and break up \n\nI'm going to say NTA instead of E S H because him making the key after specifically being told not to is a huge violation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While yes, fianc\u00e9 shouldn't have done what he did, goddamn I understand what drove him to do that.\n\nThere are so many solutions to this problem, none were taken.", "> OP sounds exhausting honestly. \n\nExhausting, immature, self-centered, irrational, and extremely privileged. \n\n\n> Good for her for being business savvy\n\nIs she business savvy, or just a rich kid who got handed a bunch of money and opportunities by her family and ex?\n\n Being business savvy doesn\u2019t give people the ability to start buying multiple properties when they are 20. It takes pre-existing money to do that. \n\n\n\n> rigid in routine with no flexibility or consideration for her fiance.\n\nThe routine is only rigid when she wants it to be. She\u2019s perfectly fine with breaking the routine to take a nap while her fianc\u00e9 waits outside for hours until she wakes up.", "That\u2019s a reasonable perspective for dating. Not a partner you live with and are planning to marry. \n\nThese two are not ready to get married. No trust, no marriage.", ">I agree that men who don't take \"no\" for an answer are terrifying. \n\nThis is such a bullshit take, which leaves no room for context and nuance. You know how many actors, writers, singers, other workers there are who did not immediately give up after hearing 1 no? How many men where told they could not do a certain education or job? Just because they did not accept a \"no\" doesn't mean they are automatically a rapist.", "I have two umbrellas in my car, so I agree.", "I agree completely that it was wrong of him to make a copy of her key. But I feel her wrong trumps his. Something about her wrong feels abusive to me; to cause so much anxiety and stress to your partner, and then go \u201cAH HA! I KNEW YOU COULDN\u2019T BE TRUSTED!\u201d when his anxiety gets the best of him & he makes a bad call by making a key.", "I agree it\u2019s weird to have the house and he not be allowed to have a key.      \nI\u2019m simply saying it\u2019s not good that he got the key without her consent and then gets shitty because she didn\u2019t answer her phone.     \nEven if they\u2019re in a relationship she\u2019s allowed to not answer her phone.      \nTho to me it seems she doesn\u2019t want to be fully in this relationship or at least she wants an out", "It\u2019s HER house! She bought it before she knew him. She SHOULD protect it. She\u2019s not using it for \u201cfunsies\u201d! It\u2019s her safe space that she is proud of buying at a young age all by herself. She\u2019s working from her kitchen that she set up for that purpose.\nShe is NTA!!!!! \nIf she wants to take a nap or spend the night by herself there, still, NTA\nGet a prenup OP, this is going to be a huge problem. It sounds like you have a much nicer home and he wants in. You\u2019re going to have a much bigger problem getting him out if you do let him in. NTA", "If I were a painter I'd give my partner a key. Maybe I'm incapacitated and need her to get something. Maybe I fall and hurt myself and need help. I am not the sole key holder for anything as a matter of principle. No matter what it is somebody has a spare key. This would be my partner unless it was a company property etc.\n\nIt doesn't sound like she trusts him or wants to be with him. This could be for good reason it could not be", "Personally I think he's the one who needs to run.", "That's what I was thinking too. OP even said in the comment that they had a talk and they are *both* the owner of the house passed down to her fiance but OP doesn't even want to let her fiance have the key to her house.", "I don't get this dnd stuff. I have set times that mine is on dnd, but it ignores it when someone calls from favorites in my phonebook. My husband, his mom, my brother, and my grandmother are on that list. When they call, dnd gets ignored because those call could be important. \nIf he can't handle only calling when it's important during OPs dnd time, that's another discussion.", "I do agree with you. I was just adding that it's not the fact that he's upset that makes him the asshole, it's purely his actions that went completely over the line and are violating, if not criminal, but his being upset isn't unjustified.\n\nIf the person you live with and are supposed to be marrying just ups and leaves and won't answer your calls, multiple times a week, wouldn't you be pissed off too?\n\nAgain, I'd just have left if I were him, rather than doing something this crazy that just wasn't going to help anything anyway.", "They are living in a house he owns. She runs off to that house to use the kitchen and is then uncontactable.\n\nFine if that's just someone you're dating, but this manic pixie dreamgirl quirky bullshit doesn't quite hit the same when you're supposed to be a) living together and b) getting married.\n\nAll this yelling of yours and CAPS and SHOUTY EXCLAMATIONS!!!! are giving more 12 year old that shouldn't be giving advice on adult relationships than someone who should be listened to.", "It sounds like he is frustrated that the woman he is planning on marrying intentionally leaves herself unavailable for hours at a time, sometimes several times a week. She has no problem living in his home but gets upset that he wants access to hers? They are partners who are planning on marrying. How exactly does she think a marriage is going to work when she's only half in the relationship. What if something serious happened to him and he couldn't reach her? Or vice versa. \n\nIt doesn't sound like she is at all ready to fully commit to a relationship and is keeping one foot out the door. He deserves better than this.", "Honestly. This relationship does NOT sound like a partnership and OP sounds like a piece of work b", "To be honest he sounds insecure. You'll need to have a conversation about what's really the problem.", "You 'don\u2019t have access' because he has asked you to respect that space as his private area and you've stayed out; because he has explicitly *forbidden* you from going in; or because it's *physically locked at all times* including when he is down there?\n\nThose things are very different from each other, and the answer makes a BIG difference on whether or not you actually have access.", "But  this time she called him so he knows her Phone is on.", "I would 100 percent be skeeved out if my boyfriend/husband/partner had a locked basement in our home that I was forbidden to enter. That's  very serial killer/kidnapping hostage vibes."]}
