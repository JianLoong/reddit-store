I bought it when I was 23 after letting my business partner take our shared assets in exchange for 600k. we owned a few properties together since we had bought our first place at 20 and 21 back when we were dating and even though we didn't work out we stayed in business together. I closed on my house a few months after my 23rd birthday. I had only been working part-time while I was managing our properties so aside from my bed and some little things from my apartment I stayed in my house for months while it was basically empty. I had always wanted to be a pastry chef and a local community college has a program that lets you get your certificate in almost anything for free with just 16 weeks of classes and if you choose to continue afterward your credits will roll over. That's where I met my fiance James (M27). James was a chef at a high-end restaurant. He had been working since 16 he started as a busser and worked his way up. While he had a lot of experience, he wanted to have a degree to back it up. We hit it off pretty quickly, he even taught me how to drive, helped me develop recipes, and helped me pick out the perfect spot to put my bakery. He proposed to me in Jamaica on August 8th, 2022. When we got back home I moved in with him. I've been perfecting recipes in my house as I had taken the time to make the kitchen to my liking. I tend to put my phone on DnD just to make sure I have no distractions. There have been a few times when I have missed calls from James and I see that it really bothers him but it's not like I go at random times I have a set schedule and I rarely go off of it.  About a week ago I finished baking quite early and ended up taking a nap my phone was still on DnD and I woke up to James banging on the door.  He told me he had been calling me for hours.  I told him I had forgotten to take my phone off DnD. He suggested that if he should have a key he could use for emergencies or in case something like this happened again. I said no because this is my safe space and I'm still adjusting to living with someone. The other day when I finished baking I noticed it was raining and I decided to call James because I don't feel comfortable driving in the rain. He didn't call me when he got here he knocked on the door and when I opened it he complained about getting wet while waiting for me and said he wouldn't have to wait if he had a key. I pointed out that he could've called me and I would've just come to the car. he said that wasn't the point and me not giving him a key was a slap in face. Yesterday I noticed he had one of those \"minute keys\" in his glove compartment while looking for my lipgloss I left in his car I immediately knew what he did and called my brother to help me change the locks, last night at dinner I let him know I found the key and told him it wouldn't be on any use as I had changed the locks.

Gtfo with that. He needs to trust you, and he clearly doesn't. \n\nThe stealing your key and copying it without your permission is just the icing on the cake. NTA.", "NTA. Your instinct to not give him a key was correct.

Wanting a escape pod and hideaway isn\u2019t bad. If I don\u2019t want to give my house key away because I want my own space doesn\u2019t make me a jerk. Trust issues would be not feeling safe with him, thinking he was cheating, or not allowing him in your spaces when you want to. Like if you hid your house for example. This is just a boundary thing. Tell him your not ready to get rid of all your boundaries yet and you may never. He has to respect that or leave. He can\u2019t control you or force you to do something. It was for sure a jerky move to steal a key. This proved you were right to set a boundary because he doesn\u2019t respect your agency. Anyway good luck your life story is awesome!! Having all that wealth at young age is so cool!! And you earned it!", "Nta- he took something that wasn't his after permission was denied.

I would recommend couples counseling if you are going to continue on this path", "NTA by miles. How do you trust someone who goes behind your back like this? This, to me, would be a major RED FLAG.", "NTA  no means no", "NTA because he did it against your wishes and behind your back. I have to say his demands that you be available at anytime he wishes and the sneaking a key seem like giant red flags to me. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure based on your lack of trust on both sides, if you are really ready to be In a relationship this far advanced?", "NTA.\n\nThat is a GIANT red flag. Do not ignore it.\n\nETA: Dynamics of the relationship aside, whether or not OP\u2019s reason for refusing to give him a key is justified, this is a breach of trust to be told no and then just go and sneakily have a copy cut.", "YTA -- who needs a \"safe space\" from their fianc\u00e9?  I can understand where he sees that as a slap in the face.", "Nta. That is a breach of trust. Be wary.", "NTA that\u2019s your private space, you explained to him very clearly why you needed it, and he\u2019s violating the shit out of your boundaries.", "Info - can you explain why you need a \"safe space\" that your fiance can't access?", "YTA.\n\nMove the fuck out of his house if you want a safe space. You are whole bunch of crazy to think it\u2019s okay that he isn\u2019t allowed a key to a place that HE OWNS AND LIVES AT.\n\nEdit: so this this is for her other home. Misread the Posts/comments. But I still think OP is an asshole and someone who isn\u2019t ready for a relationship. If she can\u2019t trust her fianc\u00e9 to have access to her home, than she isn\u2019t ready to be with him for the rest of her life.", "NTA - this relationship won't work", "Don't marry him.", "The issue isn't if someone is an AH. The issue is that you aren't ready for the relationship you are in. He wants unrestricted access to you at all times, and you want privacy and space. To me, he sounds creepy and pushy, and you sound distant and like you aren't all in. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and break up \n\nI'm going to say NTA instead of E S H because him making the key after specifically being told not to is a huge violation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You guys should reevaluate this relationship.", "That's really what's happening. I checked to make sure they gave me the lowest dose because oh my goodness. Thanks for the heads up.", ">churlish\n\nNew word for me! And I love it.", "Insubordinate AND churlish!\n\n(K&P reference)", "It feels like neither of you are ready to marry. You sound like somewhat combative roommates more than two people in love, ready to share their lives with each other.", "All those reasons are fine. I get the kitchen thing, but you're not baking to sell out of your home, non-commercial kitchen. You're doing it to perfect recipes - leisurely (improve skill and techniques). Right? \n\nYou should have shared a key considering you spend so much spare time there. He shouldn't have made a copy without permission. \n\nESH.\n\nEdit: Just to add, I think it's weird you host girls' night at your old house instead of your shared home.", "It\u2019s wild to me that people are pissed at you for enjoying your property lol", "Is girls night also work related? Asking for a friend.", "He turned the basement into a man cave long before met. I\u2019ve probably been Down there twice.", "He owned his house longer than OP", "I don\u2019t think OP has even thought that far into the future, by the looks of it they\u2019re not even ready to be in a mature regular adult relationship, let alone getting married.", "What did you think I meant when I said Custom pink? It\u2019s as close to commercial as it could possibly be inside someone\u2019s home. And again I don\u2019t spend \u201cso much time there\u201d I\u2019m there a few hours while he\u2019s working. He only knows I\u2019m there because I tell him. It\u2019s not time we\u2019re not spending together it\u2019s time he doesn\u2019t have.", "Depends are you also having them test your products or are the friends also coworkers? Then yes, otherwise I\u2019d classify it as more mental health/ therapy than work related lol.", "You have an entire house and he has a isolated room in the home you 2 share? \nEdit: ESH (while I think you are wrong for the propertys way of thinking, he was still wrong for secretly taking a copy of the key)", "What does that have to do with anything? He wants a key to her house that he doesn\u2019t live in. I personally think they are both AH\u2019s but again, this is not relevant at all.", "Argue with me all you want. You asked for judgment, and I gave it to you. \n\nIn case you missed it, ESH (*including you*)", "Touche \ud83d\ude06", "You\u2019re earlier post said u didn\u2019t know if he owned or rented. So follow the thread you never corrected that", "If op wanted to make a compromise or a gesture she could get a lock that also has a programmable keypad on it. That way should someone need to stop by either to check on the place if she goes out of town, or to drop something off, etc- she can give them the code and change it after they\u2019re finished. Although after the stunt the fianc\u00e9 pulled of going behind her back to have a key made, I personally wouldn\u2019t be wanting to make a gesture like that anytime soon. Especially not if he refuses to admit he was wrong and apologize."]}
