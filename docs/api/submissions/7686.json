I bought it when I was 23 after letting my business partner take our shared assets in exchange for 600k. we owned a few properties together since we had bought our first place at 20 and 21 back when we were dating and even though we didn't work out we stayed in business together. I closed on my house a few months after my 23rd birthday. I had only been working part-time while I was managing our properties so aside from my bed and some little things from my apartment I stayed in my house for months while it was basically empty. I had always wanted to be a pastry chef and a local community college has a program that lets you get your certificate in almost anything for free with just 16 weeks of classes and if you choose to continue afterward your credits will roll over. That's where I met my fiance James (M27). James was a chef at a high-end restaurant. He had been working since 16 he started as a busser and worked his way up. While he had a lot of experience, he wanted to have a degree to back it up. We hit it off pretty quickly, he even taught me how to drive, helped me develop recipes, and helped me pick out the perfect spot to put my bakery. He proposed to me in Jamaica on August 8th, 2022. When we got back home I moved in with him. I've been perfecting recipes in my house as I had taken the time to make the kitchen to my liking. I tend to put my phone on DnD just to make sure I have no distractions. There have been a few times when I have missed calls from James and I see that it really bothers him but it's not like I go at random times I have a set schedule and I rarely go off of it.  About a week ago I finished baking quite early and ended up taking a nap my phone was still on DnD and I woke up to James banging on the door.  He told me he had been calling me for hours.  I told him I had forgotten to take my phone off DnD. He suggested that if he should have a key he could use for emergencies or in case something like this happened again. I said no because this is my safe space and I'm still adjusting to living with someone. The other day when I finished baking I noticed it was raining and I decided to call James because I don't feel comfortable driving in the rain. He didn't call me when he got here he knocked on the door and when I opened it he complained about getting wet while waiting for me and said he wouldn't have to wait if he had a key. I pointed out that he could've called me and I would've just come to the car. he said that wasn't the point and me not giving him a key was a slap in face. Yesterday I noticed he had one of those \"minute keys\" in his glove compartment while looking for my lipgloss I left in his car I immediately knew what he did and called my brother to help me change the locks, last night at dinner I let him know I found the key and told him it wouldn't be on any use as I had changed the locks.

Your instinct to not give him a key was correct.

Wanting a escape pod and hideaway isn\u2019t bad. If I don\u2019t want to give my house key away because I want my own space doesn\u2019t make me a jerk. Trust issues would be not feeling safe with him, thinking he was cheating, or not allowing him in your spaces when you want to. Like if you hid your house for example. This is just a boundary thing. Tell him your not ready to get rid of all your boundaries yet and you may never. He has to respect that or leave. He can\u2019t control you or force you to do something. It was for sure a jerky move to steal a key. This proved you were right to set a boundary because he doesn\u2019t respect your agency. Anyway good luck your life story is awesome!! Having all that wealth at young age is so cool!! And you earned it!", "Nta- he took something that wasn't his after permission was denied.

I would recommend couples counseling if you are going to continue on this path", "NTA by miles. How do you trust someone who goes behind your back like this? This, to me, would be a major RED FLAG.", "NTA  no means no", "NTA because he did it against your wishes and behind your back. I have to say his demands that you be available at anytime he wishes and the sneaking a key seem like giant red flags to me. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure based on your lack of trust on both sides, if you are really ready to be In a relationship this far advanced?", "NTA.\n\nThat is a GIANT red flag. Do not ignore it.\n\nETA: Dynamics of the relationship aside, whether or not OP\u2019s reason for refusing to give him a key is justified, this is a breach of trust to be told no and then just go and sneakily have a copy cut.", "YTA -- who needs a \"safe space\" from their fianc\u00e9?  I can understand where he sees that as a slap in the face.", "Nta. That is a breach of trust. Be wary.", "NTA that\u2019s your private space, you explained to him very clearly why you needed it, and he\u2019s violating the shit out of your boundaries.", "Info - can you explain why you need a \"safe space\" that your fiance can't access?", "YTA.\n\nMove the fuck out of his house if you want a safe space. You are whole bunch of crazy to think it\u2019s okay that he isn\u2019t allowed a key to a place that HE OWNS AND LIVES AT.\n\nEdit: so this this is for her other home. Misread the Posts/comments. But I still think OP is an asshole and someone who isn\u2019t ready for a relationship. If she can\u2019t trust her fianc\u00e9 to have access to her home, than she isn\u2019t ready to be with him for the rest of her life.", "NTA - this relationship won't work", "Don't marry him.", "The issue isn't if someone is an AH. The issue is that you aren't ready for the relationship you are in. He wants unrestricted access to you at all times, and you want privacy and space. To me, he sounds creepy and pushy, and you sound distant and like you aren't all in. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and break up \n\nI'm going to say NTA instead of E S H because him making the key after specifically being told not to is a huge violation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes I do.", "Okay since we\u2019re being technical we live in the house he owns. I use my house for working and hosting.", "This was my exact thought. DND for hours at your other house that he's not allowed in to? Yeah. That's sus. Even if she's not doing anything, it's still suspicious behavior. There's a huge trust divide on both sides.", "He\u2019s a chef I doubt he thinks it\u2019s weird I\u2019m on dnd in the kitchen he actually suggested it to me given the fact that I have the attention span of a three year old. I also only go while he\u2019s at work so even if my phone wasn\u2019t in DND He would be the one person who couldn\u2019t reach me.", "Does this mean he should take back her key to his place?", "Lmao the amount of reaching is insane.", "I think that could be the case and I\u2019m probably just reading into it too much, he did say he didn\u2019t think I would care because I more of brushed it off like I wasn\u2019t taking him seriously", "Was going to say the same. My family were paranoid about getting in touch with me in an emergency scenario. If family rings after 10pm it's an emergency. \n\n\nMy current and previous android models have all had the permissions set so that certain contacts can ring through when DnD is on. There's also a setting that allows calls if any number phones twice in a 15 minute window, your phone will alert you and ring.", "No problem, it\u2019s a game changer for me lol. Wishing you the best!", "You can also go to his contact on your phone, edit, go to the ringtone section & toggle on emergency bypass :)", "It can, but that\u2019s a setting you need to turn on first.", "Right?!?!  She\u2019s not taking this seriously enough!  Red flags everywhere!", "Wait, you have a key to his place, which belongs exclusively to him under the law since it\u2019s deeded only to him, and you had a problem with him asking to have a key for yours? Am I understanding that right?", "She said , very clearly , that it gives her space and quiet to work on her recipes. Baking is a bitch! I HATE it \u2026so I understand the need for concentration and let\u2019s face it , the fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s the type to be able to not be constant contact with his SO. Stage 5 Clinger", "The reason is that she likes her alone time in her personal space. That's a pretty goddamn good reason.", "Yeah this is so weird. She's absolutely entitled to decide whether he should have a key, but it just seems like someone that needs this level of alone time in her own space isn't ready to move in with her partner yet. And that's ok!", "I just don't feel that she has to justify to any of us her decision to continue using her house as she wishes. \n\nHer question was is she the AH for changing locks. The answer is no, because he stomped on a boundary and made a key behind her back. It doesn't *matter* what she does at her house, he had no right to do that.", ">  he doesn\u2019t need a key to my workspace \n\nHe clearly does, because you keep inviting him over and then not letting him in. If he only swung by once in a blue moon to give you a ride, they way most people do with their partner's workspaces, he wouldn't need a key. But it sounds like he's coming over to your current workspace often enough that a key would make both your lives easier.", "Lol, that was about life changes and not about property.", "I don\u2019t not trust him he just doesn\u2019t need it and I think there\u2019s an actual reason he wants it that he\u2019s not telling me", "Is he controlling in any other ways?", "Well then, from the limited view I've got of the situation, I kinda get where he's coming from to a point. \n\nI guess from his perspective, he thinks that he has opened his home to you  to make your own and you're planning on spending the rest of your lives together so why would you not want to do the same? The fact that did not happen has obviously alerted something in him so he asked about a key and you refused... Pushing him to do something bloody outrageous to find out what that could be.\n\nLet me be clear, he has crossed the line and that's for you to deal with in whatever way you decide... But... It ain't good from either side to be honest. If he doesn't trust you and you need a place he cannot enter, it's probably not the best of matches.\n\n**Something about fish in the sea**.", "You fall and hit your head\n\nSomeone breaks in and you are dying and unconscious\n\nYou are dead\n\nYou napping and missing his calls is probably what set him into a spiral of paranoia. Because he wasn't at work and you forgot to take your phone off DND so your schedule was off", "Why would you never move him into your house? That\u2019s a very strange thing to say about someone you\u2019re currently living with and planning to marry.", "Ya I really don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re against him having a key unless you have some major childhood trauma", "The point is he's going to be your partner. If you don't trust your partner with a key to your house even just for emergencies that's a huge problem. Especially when you are inconsiderate and inconveniencing him when he's going out of his way for YOU. Might as well get him a dog house if he's not allowed in when it rains.", "It means he\u2019s welcome to buy a second house for himself or suggest they live in a neutral ground, not that he has an inherent right to her property and self", "What do you do in those times where you absolutely can't be disturbed, for example an important work meeting, or an interview?  Turn the phone off?", "I don\u2019t have a problem with him asking I have a problem with him doing it without my permission", "Umm yes I live there lmao.", "Had a pretty bad repetitive shoulder injury several years back - doc gave me muscle relaxers and I mean, it worked, I was able to move my arm without wanting to cry afterwards, but I don't remember much of the three days I was on them and have been told I was asleep an unnatural amount.", "My doctor recommended halving my prescription, which turned out great. I don't use it often, but at half the dose, it works the same and it's so much easier to get up the next morning.", "I had to take one in order to sleep when i had covid because the migraine hurt so bad that my eyes closed hurt. I ended up waking in the middle of the night because i accidentally peed myself and nearly fell down the stairs just trying to get to the bathroom. They really mess you up", "But don't you own a bakery? Why don't you trial recipes there??", "\u201cI don\u2019t not trust him, I just think he\u2019s not telling me something\u201d \n\nSo you don\u2019t trust him.", "No he\u2019s really supportive and loving. Never controlling.", "If that were the case I\u2019d be dead before he got off work.", "Well, that's not true,  she said above she has girls night there as well. People don't exactly bring their friends to their workspace.", "Ahh.. so he has to buy a second house in order for her not to have the right to his property.", "I've always put my phone on silent for interviews or a funeral or hospital etc. It's very very rare I need to. Occasionally in life your going to be unreachable. There's a 15 min stretch on my commute home where phone signal drops off regardless of whichever carrier your with. Then there's airplane mode when flying.", "Chicanerous and deplorable!", "Same, I\u2019m super confused on what\u2019s wrong? I would like a second house to pinkify with all my hobbies", "They\u2019re jealous- she\u2019s got a 600k spare house.", "Agreed. Her house, her business.", "No I think there\u2019s a reason he went from \u201cI don\u2019t need a key\u201d to making one without my knowledge. It\u2019s not like him at all", "It bothers him when your phone is on dnd and you miss his calls, he showed up banging on the door when you fell asleep, he repeatedly demanded a key to your house after you said no, he stole your key and made a copy without your consent. He reacted with anger when you informed him the locks were changed and he's not speaking to you know. That's controlling behavior. The silent treatment is a ploy to get you to change your mind and give him what he wants.", "Depending on when it happened. It could have happened minutes or hours ago. If you are actively dying, even a minute could potentially save you. And it doesn't sound like he's going to just invade your home for no reason as he doesn't like to be around when you are baking. So what reasons do you think he has for wanting a key???", "Good point. However, I also saw that her boyfriend has a man cave in their shared house. I would assume she can enter his man cave if she wants or needs to though, so purposely ensuring he cannot access her home in an emergency, or hell, even to just make him feel more secure in their relationship, is pretty shitty of her.", "Nah, he agreed to her having a key. She did not agree to him having a key. She doesn\u2019t have a right to the key just like he doesn\u2019t have a right to the key", "A-A-Ron!\n\nD-nice!", "It\u2019s not spare because they aren\u2019t married yet. He owns his home outright and could kick her out and then she\u2019d be screwed. This is smart financially and emotionally in my opinion. And then you add the business aspect?", "He told you that the key was made specifically to get into your house, yes? \n\nThe point of marriage is that you are going to spending and sharing the entire rest of your life with someone. \n\nIf you do not trust this person with a key to your house, *then you shouldn\u2019t be marrying them*\n\nI understand your reasoning for wanting to keep your own house. I don\u2019t understand your reasoning for keeping your fianc\u00e9 out of it.", "So, it's alright if he takes his key back and have her knock every time she comes over?", "Absolutely and OP mentioned a prenup. I only used \u2018spare\u2019 to denote that it\u2019s a house she\u2019s not living in full time.", "It\u2019s not like he CANT go but I\u2019m only there when he\u2019s busy and Why should he be there if I\u2019m not?", "Did he confirm that the key was made to get into your house? \n\nHe wants a key for situations like you described in your OP - to be able to reach you in case of a potential emergency (when you were unreachable), and to get in when you\u2019re home and unable to let him in right away. Why is that so unreasonable of your *literal fianc\u00e9* to want?"]}
