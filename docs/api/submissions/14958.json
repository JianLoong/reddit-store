One day when I was 12 I found out my sister wasn\u2019t my dads daughter and my mom dismissed it and called me nosey.\nMy mom upped and left when I was 14ish. We were living in another country (my dad and I are American, she isn\u2019t) and said that she\u2019d be working in the US with a workers visa and that she\u2019d be back in 6 months. She never came back. Mom was really nasty and abusive to me my whole life but my sister was her little princess. My sister never saw any wrong doings on my moms part.\nAnyway, now we\u2019re back in the US, my sister is now 18 and about to graduate from HS in mid May. She\u2019s got amazing grades while also being pretty much my dads nurse because he is bed bound (I live about 2 hours away from them). I\u2019m not on speaking terms with my mom and haven\u2019t been for 3 years now.\nI have been trying to tell my dad for about 2 years now that my sister needs to know that he isn\u2019t her bio daughter, specially before she does to college because she is considering going to another state but he won\u2019t do it. Last time we spoke about it he said \u201cjust tell her when I die.\u201d Which I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. My sister and I are extremely close and i care for her and I feel this is something she needs to know but no one is taking it seriously enough.\n\nWell, I told dad yesterday that once her graduation was over I was telling her unless he decided to tell her himself. He argued with me, said it wasn\u2019t my place or my business, how it was completely unnecessary for her to know and that there\u2019s no benefit to it.\nHe kinda scared me. Said she would hate my guts, I\u2019ll hurt a lot of people including her, and all these things that now have me wondering if I\u2019m making a good choice.\nHelp, Reddit. Should I tell my sister about this or keep it to myself? \n\nAnother note I want to add is that my dads black and my mom is latina. My sister\u2019s dad is white and she is very light skinned- if you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d think she was white. In her school she tells people she\u2019s half black and teachers have asked her if she was sure.

Not your place.  And a daughter/dad relationship is a lot more than who contributed DNA.  If he's treated her as his daughter his entire life, then that girl is his daughter.  The end.\n\nNow, the racial aspect is complicated.. but there I'd like to say that if she grew up in household with a black father,  thinking she was biologically 1/2 black, etc.  That's not nothing.  And it's going to be a hell of a thing to find out she's NOT. \n\nYWBTA\n\nedit:  I saw where your dad said \"just tell her when I'm dead\".  I would suggest you tell him that she's naturally going to have a LOT of questions when she finds out she's not biologically his.  If he's already gone when that happens, many of those will remain unanswered.  It would also be nice for her to hear from his lips that it never mattered to him.", "YWNBTA--mainly since your parents suck since they put you in this position of keeping the secret in the first place. If you tell her after he dies, she may be angry with you for not telling her sooner. If you tell her now, she may also be angry with you. Your dad should be cognizant that he has helped continue a really shitty situation that forces you to keep a secret. He's the asshole in my mind (second to your mother). \n\n**I would tell your dad how much stress this is causing you and how he has put you in this position of having to keep a terrible secret from your sister (and how it may blow up on you after he's dead). Maybe framing it in the light of how it's hurting you instead of how she needs to know will help him see the light.** \n\nAll that said, if you are going to tell her you need to be really sure though. Be prepared for your dad and your sister to stop speaking to you. Your dad seems panicked and vindictive, and your sister is going to have so many emotions she may take them out on everyone around her. You wouldn't be the asshole if you told her, but I wouldn't blame you if you didn't tell her either.", "YWBTA.  Yes, your sister has the right to know where she comes from and medical history and all that.  However, if your dad specifically asked you to tell her when he is dead. . ...what purpose would it serve to tell her sooner?", "Nta for wanting to tell the truth. Yta if you do not respect your dad's wishes on the matter. Perhaps have him write a letter or record a message for her to confirm once he has passed. It sounds like he raised your sister and by all means is her dad. It is not your place to ruin this relationship when it sounds like you all need each other in the moment.", "YWBTA. I understand why you want her to know the truth. But telling her right now would just cause chaos.  She\u2019s clearly close to her dad, bio father or not. And I don\u2019t think you should mess that up while he\u2019s alive. It really doesn\u2019t accomplish anything other than causing her a ton of angst. My suggestion would be to have your dad write a letter telling her the truth but explaining how much he loves her. And then tell her and give her the letter after he dies. And expect her to hate you for a while. I\u2019m not even sure I would tell her in pre DNA days. But it\u2019s highly possible she will figure it out one day and it might be better to explain. But remember you not only will screw with her parental relationships, you will change her racial identity and that\u2019s going to be a mindf*ck. Please only tell her if it\u2019s for the right reasons.", "YWBTA\n\nHe's right. It's not your place. I don't know why you think it's so urgent.  It sounds like she's happy and she and your dad have a good relationship.  Why ruin something because someone has a 'right to know '. \n\nAsk yourself if she really needs to know RIGHT NOW and if there is any good to be has for her to find out on YOUR timetable (which is what it is).\n\nYour dad said to wait until he's gone. Maybe you should respect his wishes,  but tell him to write a letter to your sister explaining everything.", "Not sure on this one. Normally I would say not to, but if she applies for grants or positions based on her ethnicity, things could blow up for her in future.", "I think this is all about your motivation for telling her. You are not doing it with malicious intend and it\u2019s her right to know and (1) confront her dad about it while he is still alive and (2) try to find her bio dad. \n\nAlso it sounds a bit like your dad could be mainly worried to loose the help of your younger sister. Which in my opinion makes it even more important that she knows. \n\nSo NTA as long as you are being gentle about it with her.", "YWBTA. I\u2019m confused as to why you think your sister needs to know. Maybe I missed it in your paragraph, but it seems like your only reason for wanting to tell her is because of some resentment towards your mother. Some attempt at revenge for her leaving you. \n\nHas your sister expressed any indication of concern or worry? Has your sister asked about this?", "NTA. I don\u2019t really get everyone saying you shouldn\u2019t tell her. Waiting until graduation is a good idea so she can finish out school with good grades and the least amount of stress possible. But as a young adult going into college and starting her adult life, she has a right to know where she comes from. \n\nIf you tell her you can help her adjust to knowledge that her dad who raised her and loved her is still her dad, but that she has a different biological father. If you don\u2019t and she finds out that you knew it could very well irreparably damage her relationship and trust in you. Everyone deserves to know their medical history and heritage which is something she currently doesn\u2019t.", "More info needed. \n\nYour dad has a serious illness, is it hereditary? Could you be saving her any worry if you told her? Does anyone else in your family know about it? (If everyone knows but her, that will hurt her even more in the long run)", "NTA your dad is using your sister as a nursemaid. She deserves to know.", "INFO: Is your sister a US citizen? Because that could really impact her when she starts applying for jobs, college, etc.", "INFO who will be caring for your dad when your sister goes to college? Is she staying close to care for him because of false obligations or going away to school? YWNBTA to tell her but if your dad is wanting a her to be his caregiver and giving her a guilt trip about leaving to better her life, the sooner you tell her the better.", "YWNBTA\n\nPeople say it's not a big deal cause he raised her. If it's not a big deal OP can say it right? \nOP's siter can decide how she reacts one she knows the truth. I don't see a reason why you shouldn't tell her except your father wishing so. \nSounds like tries to avoid explaining himself which is just cruel to your sister if she wants to talk", "NTA for caring, but mind your own business.  YWBTA if you tell her.  The father\u2019s wishes should be respected! If she gets to be 25 or so and still doesn\u2019t know, then try to toad to Dad again. A letter from Dad on file with his attorney is an important and valuable safeguard.  Whatever Dad is afraid of, he\u2019s probably right and she is still too young to receive such a jolt.  If Dad isn\u2019t 100% on board, this could make a big mess. This is absolutely not your decision!", "Can you imagine putting your heart and soul into taking care of your sick father, then his bio daughter who lives far away came along and told you thats not even your real Dad, how would you feel?  It's not going to be a fairy tale moment.", "YTA. who are you to tell? Butt out. Sounds like you\u2019re jealous of your sister and want to hurt her. Your actions would be horrible if you say anything. Sounds like you hate your sister and want to hurt her badly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's no happy ending. If you tell her after your dad dies, she'll hate you for not telling her. If you tell her now, everyone else will hate you for spilling the beans.  Rip the band-aid off now.", "NTA your sister has a right to know and understand where she comes from. As an adult she DEFINITELY has this right. As long as it's gone about in a sensitive and caring way, I think she has the right to know. Just realize that whatever happens after that is a bit of a weight on your shoulders that I don't think you should have to carry.  At the end of the day, your parents should probably be the ones to carry that.  But if they aren't stepping up, I can see why you would feel that you should.", "I am in the same kind of position as you but it's a long time situation. My brother knows my Dad adopted him (Dad has now passed), my Mum will not tell my Brother about his bio but my Dad told me. I have begged and pleaded with my M to tell my bro because he deserves to know but it's not my place to tell him especially as bio dad has passed also", "NTA.  She'll find out eventually and will be furious at everyone who knew and kept it from her day in, day out,vyear after year.  She's already going to - rightfully - be pissed that it's been kept from her, the actual subject of the secret, for so long already.  It may not be your business but it sure as hell is HER business and should should not cover for your lying parents another day.", "You should tell her", "Oof, I\u2019m going with NTA. I get that people are saying it\u2019s not your place, and they\u2019re right that it shouldn\u2019t be your place, it should be your dad\u2019s. It would be great if he was ready to tell her and explain that she\u2019s still his daughter and he still loves her just the same. However, he\u2019s said he\u2019s not going to do it, and your sister is an adult. Bottom line for me, I would want to know. What if your sister decides she wants to find her bio dad? Not telling her the truth deprives her if that chance. If she finds out later on her own (there are a lot of DNA kits out there), how is she going to feel to learn that her family never told her, and even worse, we\u2019re never really planning to tell her (until your dad passed, I guess). This is tough, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an AH to tell her. You\u2019ve warned your dad and you\u2019re doing it for her.", "You can't say anything. Ask your dad to write her a note that can be given after his death. But it's not your place to decide when. If your father loves her like his own it's not hurting anyone. But she may need medical info one day. But don't do this. You will be the A.", "The absolute only reason I want to tell her while he is live is because she could have a million questions about it that my dad could answer. If he\u2019s not there to answer them then I feel like it would weigh much heavier on her. Plus, It\u2019d be good for her to be able to talk to him and see how he was the one who was there for her her whole life. Am I wrong?", "You know what, I think even that is not an issue in this case.  She doesn't know, so if she applies for grants in this circumstance, it's not fraudulent on her part, and her upbringing has been in a home with a black parent, which matters much more than her DNA.  Yes, it's possible it could come back on her, but I suspect it's unlikely to.", "That's a really good point.", "Best answer I\u2019ve seen so far", "Maybe, maybe not. My grandaughter's birth certificate says her Dad (my son) is black. He's not. We haven't corrected it, because what's the point? Really.", "Didn't think of that", "I would add make sure you tell her in a place that is quite and allows for time to process her feelings. That news could make anyone sad angry cry. Give her some support afterwards. Give her space if she wants it but tell her that your still family to her and offer to help her if you can", "Why shouldn't she know", "Do you know who your father is?  Why wouldn't this woman have the same right?", "My dad is a diabetic. He lost his leg and he got depressed, lost all muscle cause he wouldn\u2019t get out of bed or exercise, so we both had to pretty much nurse him. Feed him, clean up after him, etc. All cause he never had the motivation to get out of bed. Everyone, absolutely everyone knows about this but her.\nAnother point to add is that I have 3 siblings (including her). All of us have different dads but my sister thinks we share the same dad.", "She is, yes.", "That\u2019s honestly how I feel, but I don\u2019t want to assume things.

What in my post made you think that?\nI\u2019m extremely over protective over her, she comes to my house and stays over at least twice a month and since she doesn\u2019t have a job I try to spoil her with her favorite things.\nThis is the reason I want to tell her. Because I love her and I worry that if I tell her after my dad passes she won\u2019t have closure. She won\u2019t be able to thank him, or to ask him questions, or just talk to him about it. I don\u2019t want her to spend the rest of her life wishing I had told her while he was still here with her.", "Aren't these really questions for your mom?  In any case, I think it's his right not to tell her, and it's not your place to do so.\n\nBut beware that she'll probably take out her anger/upset/betrayal on you no matter when you tell her.  And whenever you tell her, she'll tell you that you made the wrong choice.

To him, She is his daughter period.  \n\nIf you're concerned about these things after he passes why don't you guys do a DNA test through ancestry.com or two three and me if and only if she's curious about her bio father but don't be surprised if she's not and don't push her.", "YTA.

How much it could then hurt her to have all these unanswered questions?", "Yeah she will if she's white.  It will help her understand that missing part if her.  Dna test will prove it too.  Shes just going to need closure from her Dad, thats between them two though."]}
