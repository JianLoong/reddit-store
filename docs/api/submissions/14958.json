My sister never saw any wrong doings on my moms part.\nAnyway, now we\u2019re back in the US, my sister is now 18 and about to graduate from HS in mid May. She\u2019s got amazing grades while also being pretty much my dads nurse because he is bed bound (I live about 2 hours away from them). I\u2019m not on speaking terms with my mom and haven\u2019t been for 3 years now.\nI have been trying to tell my dad for about 2 years now that my sister needs to know that he isn\u2019t her bio daughter, specially before she does to college because she is considering going to another state but he won\u2019t do it.

Not your place.  And a daughter/dad relationship is a lot more than who contributed DNA.  If he's treated her as his daughter his entire life, then that girl is his daughter.  The end.\n\nNow, the racial aspect is complicated.. but there I'd like to say that if she grew up in household with a black father,  thinking she was biologically 1/2 black, etc.  That's not nothing.  And it's going to be a hell of a thing to find out she's NOT. \n\nYWBTA\n\nedit:  I saw where your dad said \"just tell her when I'm dead\".  I would suggest you tell him that she's naturally going to have a LOT of questions when she finds out she's not biologically his.  If he's already gone when that happens, many of those will remain unanswered.  It would also be nice for her to hear from his lips that it never mattered to him.", "YWNBTA--mainly since your parents suck since they put you in this position of keeping the secret in the first place. If you tell her after he dies, she may be angry with you for not telling her sooner. If you tell her now, she may also be angry with you. Your dad should be cognizant that he has helped continue a really shitty situation that forces you to keep a secret. He's the asshole in my mind (second to your mother). \n\n**I would tell your dad how much stress this is causing you and how he has put you in this position of having to keep a terrible secret from your sister (and how it may blow up on you after he's dead). Maybe framing it in the light of how it's hurting you instead of how she needs to know will help him see the light.** \n\nAll that said, if you are going to tell her you need to be really sure though. Be prepared for your dad and your sister to stop speaking to you. Your dad seems panicked and vindictive, and your sister is going to have so many emotions she may take them out on everyone around her. You wouldn't be the asshole if you told her, but I wouldn't blame you if you didn't tell her either.", "YWBTA.  Yes, your sister has the right to know where she comes from and medical history and all that.  However, if your dad specifically asked you to tell her when he is dead. . ...what purpose would it serve to tell her sooner?", "Nta for wanting to tell the truth. Yta if you do not respect your dad's wishes on the matter. Perhaps have him write a letter or record a message for her to confirm once he has passed. It sounds like he raised your sister and by all means is her dad. It is not your place to ruin this relationship when it sounds like you all need each other in the moment.", "YWBTA. I understand why you want her to know the truth. But telling her right now would just cause chaos.  She\u2019s clearly close to her dad, bio father or not. And I don\u2019t think you should mess that up while he\u2019s alive. It really doesn\u2019t accomplish anything other than causing her a ton of angst. My suggestion would be to have your dad write a letter telling her the truth but explaining how much he loves her. And then tell her and give her the letter after he dies. And expect her to hate you for a while. I\u2019m not even sure I would tell her in pre DNA days. But it\u2019s highly possible she will figure it out one day and it might be better to explain. But remember you not only will screw with her parental relationships, you will change her racial identity and that\u2019s going to be a mindf*ck. Please only tell her if it\u2019s for the right reasons.", "YWBTA\n\nHe's right. It's not your place. I don't know why you think it's so urgent.  It sounds like she's happy and she and your dad have a good relationship.  Why ruin something because someone has a 'right to know '. \n\nAsk yourself if she really needs to know RIGHT NOW and if there is any good to be has for her to find out on YOUR timetable (which is what it is).\n\nYour dad said to wait until he's gone. Maybe you should respect his wishes,  but tell him to write a letter to your sister explaining everything.", "Not sure on this one. Normally I would say not to, but if she applies for grants or positions based on her ethnicity, things could blow up for her in future.", "I think this is all about your motivation for telling her. You are not doing it with malicious intend and it\u2019s her right to know and (1) confront her dad about it while he is still alive and (2) try to find her bio dad. \n\nAlso it sounds a bit like your dad could be mainly worried to loose the help of your younger sister. Which in my opinion makes it even more important that she knows. \n\nSo NTA as long as you are being gentle about it with her.", "YWBTA. I\u2019m confused as to why you think your sister needs to know. Maybe I missed it in your paragraph, but it seems like your only reason for wanting to tell her is because of some resentment towards your mother. Some attempt at revenge for her leaving you. \n\nHas your sister expressed any indication of concern or worry? Has your sister asked about this?", "NTA. I don\u2019t really get everyone saying you shouldn\u2019t tell her. Waiting until graduation is a good idea so she can finish out school with good grades and the least amount of stress possible. But as a young adult going into college and starting her adult life, she has a right to know where she comes from. \n\nIf you tell her you can help her adjust to knowledge that her dad who raised her and loved her is still her dad, but that she has a different biological father. If you don\u2019t and she finds out that you knew it could very well irreparably damage her relationship and trust in you. Everyone deserves to know their medical history and heritage which is something she currently doesn\u2019t.", "More info needed. \n\nYour dad has a serious illness, is it hereditary? Could you be saving her any worry if you told her? Does anyone else in your family know about it? (If everyone knows but her, that will hurt her even more in the long run)", "NTA your dad is using your sister as a nursemaid. She deserves to know.", "INFO: Is your sister a US citizen? Because that could really impact her when she starts applying for jobs, college, etc.", "INFO who will be caring for your dad when your sister goes to college? Is she staying close to care for him because of false obligations or going away to school? YWNBTA to tell her but if your dad is wanting a her to be his caregiver and giving her a guilt trip about leaving to better her life, the sooner you tell her the better.", "YWNBTA\n\nPeople say it's not a big deal cause he raised her. If it's not a big deal OP can say it right? \nOP's siter can decide how she reacts one she knows the truth. I don't see a reason why you shouldn't tell her except your father wishing so. \nSounds like tries to avoid explaining himself which is just cruel to your sister if she wants to talk", "NTA for caring, but mind your own business.  YWBTA if you tell her.  The father\u2019s wishes should be respected! If she gets to be 25 or so and still doesn\u2019t know, then try to toad to Dad again. A letter from Dad on file with his attorney is an important and valuable safeguard.  Whatever Dad is afraid of, he\u2019s probably right and she is still too young to receive such a jolt.  If Dad isn\u2019t 100% on board, this could make a big mess. This is absolutely not your decision!", "Can you imagine putting your heart and soul into taking care of your sick father, then his bio daughter who lives far away came along and told you thats not even your real Dad, how would you feel?  It's not going to be a fairy tale moment.", "YTA. who are you to tell? Butt out. Sounds like you\u2019re jealous of your sister and want to hurt her.

If she finds out later on her own (there are a lot of DNA kits out there), how is she going to feel to learn that her family never told her, and even worse, we\u2019re never really planning to tell her (until your dad passed, I guess).

You mentioned your dad is bedbound but didn't say why.  If there are serious health issues that run in your dad's side of the family, your sister has to be worried about whether she has inherited those issues (genetically speaking).  At least if she knows she isn't your dad's biological offspring, it might put her mind at ease about that.  If she finds out before your dad dies, he might be able to tell her something about her biological/genetic makeup (assuming he knows anything about your mom's affair partner).

If your sister is half Latina and half Anglo, she has a lower chance of having that trait.

Skin color is a poor indicator of parentage, a Latin Mom and Black Dad can definitely have a child that passes. And where is your Mom in all of this? You mention that your sister is her princess and assuming you are correct wouldn't she be the best person to answer questions about your sister's parentage?\nThere is a missing element here that I am not understanding. The rush to tell the sister now, the pressure on the father to come clean. If you are so sure that he is not the father then why aren't you stepping up to take care of him instead of your sister? It feels somehow like some farfetched attempt to hurt the mother but will instead hurt the father and sister the most. \n\nYWBTA until I receive additional info.", "Your father should tell her. She can get in trouble in some communities for saying what she says at school at college.", "This is such a terrible situation as you lose for telling her and you will lose for not telling her when you always knew.\n\nAlso, the impact of his diabetes can be drastically altered with diet. His primary caretakers can stop enabling him by overtreding him so that he was more active.", "NTA.\n\nIt is, in fact, not your place to keep secrets about your sister from her.\n\nYour dad doesn't have the right to keep this information from your sister. He's being a coward.", "NTA. Everyone has the right to know the truth about their own life. Everyone here who is saying it\u2019s not your place should imagine themselves realizing at like 30 years old that their bio dad isn\u2019t who they thought it was. The shock and betrayal would be tremendous, that their family didn\u2019t think to let them know this fundamental truth about themselves. The comments that say she should have a chance to ask your dad questions only he will have answers for are right. She deserves to know about herself.\n\nYour dad is being selfish, putting the onus on you after he dies and avoiding answering difficult questions.", "This is a bell you can\u2019t unring. You are deciding to change how she looks at everything from her racial identity to her family dynamics and make up. What good would it bring? Why does she need to know? Do you know who her biological father is? Would this person bring value to her life? How is she going to feel after have lost the man she considered her father and this biological father rejects her? You are putting her in a position that she is going to have make big choices that no one knows the outcome to? Let her go to college. Let her be an 18 year old. It sounds from the description you gave she hasn\u2019t had an easy life so far, why would make it harder? If so many people have made the comment on her looks she probably had an idea and has either decided to ignore or doesn\u2019t want to believe it. You forcing her to come face to face with this because you believe she needs to know is frankly cruel.", "YWBTA it's either your mum's or dad's place but not yours. To be honest I think you should give your mum the ultimatum you gave to your dad. He seems like a living and caring dad and it might be good if he wrote her a letter for when he is no more. But this is a tricky situation and a tough spot for your to be in! Even if you tell her, you might be an AH but I think your motives are honest and it might also be a good thing for your sister to know your didn't keep it to yourself.", "You don't hide being adopted from people, why is this situation any different?", "Why would her obligations change? I don\u2019t believe children are obligated to take care of their parents anyway, but if they were\u2026 this man raised her as his own daughter, even after her mother left. He is 100% her parent.", "> If she didn't nurse him after that info, then she's an asshole because he spent her entire life raising a kid that wasn't his.\n\nOr she feels betrayed because she's been lied to all her life?", "Dude that's mean. He raised that child and he doesn't want to deal with the fallout when she'll be hurt from the truth. He's vulnerable and sick now. She's planning to leave anyway so he'll be losing his caretaker anyway. He doesn't want his child knowing she's not biologically his, especially when he cannot comfort her properly.", "Ask you dad to write everything down in a letter for her to read when he passes that might explain everything.", "You mean your MOM can answer a million questions. She\u2019s the one who cheated and created a baby with another man. Wth can your dad tell her about said sperm donor that your mom can\u2019t?\n\nTell your sister after he passes, or not at all. Why ruin her happiness?", "Elizabeth Warren genuinely believed she was part Native American, and people made a huge deal of it when it turned out she wasn\u2019t. I agree that she\u2019d be doing absolutely nothing wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean there wouldn\u2019t be issues.", "He is LYING to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**He does not even love her enough to tell her the truth.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He's vulnerable and sick now. \" .. He should have told her when he was not.", "The man loved her enough to raise her as his own, even after her mother left. I think he\u2019s wrong to not tell her but he obviously loves her a very great deal.", ">He does not even love her enough to tell her the truth.\n\nYou **cannot** make assumptions like this about other peoples lives and feelings and then present it as truth. It's sooo harmful. \n\nMaybe her dad is just thinking about the fact that her mom has already abandoned her, so he's all she has. Is it worth it to rip that away from her as well? \n\nYour point of view is valid, but it's *your* point of view, not the whole worlds.", "She's eighteen now. So when he wasn't sick, she was a kid. The mother wasn't around. Imagine being told that your bio parent left and the guy raising you is raising you out of pity. That's how she would have taken it.", "No I think the dad is a coward not to tell her while he is still there to answer questions. Instead he\u2019s leaving it to the older sister to have to do it and face backlash of all the emotions and anger by herself. NTA", "If nothing else she needs to know for medical history", "But now she is an adult .. time to stop lying to her.", "Sure, that's fair enough, although only if her bio dad / his immediate family have any genetic conditions.\n\nAnd I do think she should be told - but not by her sister. My only point was it's awful saying her dad doesn't love her when noone has any way of knowing that."]}
