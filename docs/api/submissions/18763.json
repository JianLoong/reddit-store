Sadly I am the stereotypical unseen middle child while Alison is the golden daughter. She literally cannot do anything wrong based on my parents' opinion.\n\nI opened up a new bakery in our town.

Now Alison is a playgirl who uses her law degree to get laid (even on my friends back in the day) but she never brought her girlfriends home. She did this time and everyone's attention was on her.\n\nThrough the whole dinner, there was only one mention of my bakery, ironically it was from Elizabeth. The rest was spent on getting to know Elizabeth and her job, interests, how she met Alison, etc. It also didn't help that she was a psychiatrist and everyone had questions. I was beyond pissed. She could've brought her home any other time but chose this one time that our parents decided to acknowledge me.\n\nSo I was cold throughout the dinner. Not that anyone really cared. At the end of the night, Alison asked me why I was sulking. I told her the truth and I said she managed to make this about herself as well, that she couldn't live if the spotlight wasn't on her.\n\nShe told me I should be happy for her because she's fallen in love and is extremely happy with her girlfriend and wanted her to be a part of this celebration. She knew exactly what bringing a girlfriend would do to the dinner. So I told her she could've done it literally any other night.\n\nRight now, we're still pretty distant. AITA here?

If that\u2019s the dynamic they\u2019ve created and perpetuated I\u2019m sure Alison has never even considered that the spotlight is always on her.", "NTA. It was insensitive and I agree with you with her being wrong because she should have checked with you if it was okay. It was YOUR celebration, not hers. It wasn\u2019t about her having to be in love, it was about your new job. It\u2019s normal to feel guilt when you\u2019ve been unseen your whole life, and with what your sister said, she made it seem you were selfish which you weren\u2019t.", "NAH I don't think your sister did it on purpose. In my experience the golden child rarely realizes how much more attention they get than their siblings. This something your parents do but you have directed your answer over it at your sister. When you've cooled down a bit I think it's worth a conversation with her about how you feel. If things go well it could lead to you two being closer, and maybe even her helping in directing more parental attention your way. \n\nYou are kind of an asshole for calling her a playgirl, how many people she sleeps with is no one's business but hers.", "NTA. You sulking is understandable especially with the context of Alison being the golden child and you feeling unseen. It is not that you are not happy for your sister, but indeed - she could have brought the gf to be introduced to the family at a different occasion.", "NTA-For wanting a dinner supposedly to celebrate you to be about you. Y T A for suggesting your sister uses her law degree to get laid.", "ESH.\n\nAlison for upstaging you, probably deliberately, at an event that was meant to be celebrating your achievement.\n\nYour parents for letting her.\n\nAnd you for this gratuitously nasty line: *Alison is a playgirl who uses her law degree to get laid.*", "YTA or ESH. You sound selfish, envious, bitter and someone who thinks that everything your sister does is wrong. She could've not come at all and you'd be still upset.\n\nPersonally I feel that's petty thing to start family drama for. Family drama never involves just you and the other participant.\n\nPoor Elisabeth. She must feel so umcomfortable to be welcomed in a family like that.", "YTA.
