Focus on the actual assholes here--your parents.  They were the ones who made it all about Allison.\n\nNow, Allison should have enough social awareness to realize when she's being the spotlight-stealer.  But golden children often don't have this awareness.  I think when tempers have calmed down, you should apologize to her BUT also let her know how you have felt through the years.  It is possible that with the right conversation, she may see what you're talking about and thus be more of an ally to you.", "NTA.\n\nAnd may I say: impressive, opening a bakery at the age of 25.

Your sister should have realized what this would cause, but I doubt it was of malicious intent. She should have asked you. What she did was thoughtless, but ultimately not horrible in my opinion. \n\nYour parents should have remembered who they were actually celebrating, I'd say it's actually just their fault for sidelining you. Wanting your gf to join family celebration is not bad, and the gf seemed to even be interested in what you do/direct the attention back to you as she asked about it.\n\nI understand how you feel, and it's completely natural. However, I think you could have been a bit more grown up about it and direct the anger to where it belongs: your parents. Maybe pull them aside and say um hello who exactly are we celebrating here. \n\nYour parents are the ones responsible for giving you their love as well. It's not your sister who needs to do something about the parents. She is not responsible for their utter failure. Asking her to tone it down so your parents can give attention to your achievements as well doesn't sound like a productive way to deal with this.

Your sister probably doesn't realise she's being treated like the golden child. So, probably lay off her. Even if she does, the parents are the ones actively ignoring you. It's their fault, not your sisters. Place the blame where it's due", "This is sorta tough, but I'll say ESH, referring to you and your parents.\n\nYour parents are assholes for pretty obvious reasons that everyone else has pretty much already told you in these comments. You, however, are also an asshole for choosing to hold so much resentment against your sister rather than your parents. Like, \"Alison is a playgirl that uses her law degree to get laid\". Seriously? That's your opinion of your sister?

They ALL should have treated the event properly.  Your sister is *maybe* a little insensitive to bring her new GF, but then again, it seems reasonable to bring her to a family event if it seems right.\n\nAfter that, is your sister, your parents, your brother who were ALL assholes for ignoring you and focusing on the new GF.  They should have been nice of course, talked with her, but kept the focus on what the actual event was for.\n\nSo NTA, but I'd say your anger should be more widespread to your whole family, not just your sister!  In a way at least she *noticed* that you were upset and asked about it, which none of the rest of your family did.", "Honestly it\u2019s probably not ever gonna change with your family.

This was your day.\n\nBut you also need to think about it this way, your sister has never not been center stage.

To her this was completely normal and is confused.\n\nThis isn't like many stories where she did it on purpose or with malicious intent, she just wanted to introduce her GF and didn't think beyond that.\n\nNo one's the AH in this situation IMO.\n\nEdit: After reading the comments I realize I forgot the parents. They are definitly the AH in this situation because it was their word that was given to you. They were the ones who promised to honor you and they threw you to the side when your sister arrived. \n\nI have little doubt that even if she hadn't brought her GF the parents would still make the night about \"Catching up\" with their out of town daughter\" \n\n(I like the rating system of rslash soooo) 2.5/5 buttholes for your parents 0.5/5 for your sister (what she did was still inconsiderate) and 0/5 for you, you had every right to be upset, just make sure it is pointed at the people who deserve it.", "Using a graduate degree to get into young women's pants... your sister is gross in a lot of ways, not just for ruining your dinner.\n\nCongratulations on your business!

How far? The way it's worded sounds like she can't just bring her home some other night, no?\n\nI think OP's feelings are valid, but also don't blame the sister.  If anything, maybe you should bring it up to the ones you're actually mad at, your parents, whom you've got this feeling of never being enough for.", "NTA, the parents are the AH here. They've enabled this all these years with no acknowledgement to your feelings whatsoever.", "NTA\n\nAnd ask your mother when you'll get your dinner.", "Probably bad timing with introducing the girlfriend to the family, but otherwise... it's completely normal, they're just talking.\n\nI get that you want more of the focus, but that doesn't always happen especially if there are more interesting things to talk about like a new gf being introduced (hence why it's bad timing)\nBut do you want them to just sit and talk about bakeries the whole time? You might have to take some initiative there because they don't know anything about it likely\n\n\nAnd either way, separate from all that, you seem to hold a lot of resentment, especially towards your sister\nI'm guessing here, but I'd imagine it's probably a pattern where she tends to be more outgoing and take more spotlight and it's probably always been that way\n\nIt's okay if you want to feel that attention and focus yourself, but you shouldn't resent your sister for it, and you definitely shouldn't be making disparaging comments about her intimate life\n\n\nIf you want to work past it, at some point I'd suggest you apologize to your sister for blaming her for something she didn't really even try to do, and then also tell her how you feel, and that you don't feel appreciated or focused on enough.\n\n\nThis isn't you vs sister.. it's just you and your sister, you're family.

Even now that I\u2019ve hit the big 50 I, the oldest, still sub-consciously see my job as protecting and guiding my younger siblings.  I feel an almost pathological  responsibility to be the have-it-all-together leader in the bunch and I could see that being perceived as being a \u201cgolden\u201d child but that was never my motivation or intention.  I\u2019ve learned to step back from that position as my siblings are all fully capable adults with children of their own but these roles are hard to shake and there are some very interesting studies about how birth order shapes who we are and affects us our whole lives.  \n\nMy point being, I agree that your sister may not have been aware of her golden child status and based on the information you provided I don\u2019t think she was purposefully trying to take your moment from you.  But I also don\u2019t think you were wrong to feel the way you did and I don\u2019t think you were wrong to express your feelings.  Just a very soft YTA for the way you did it.  Sulking is never a good way of communicating a need.  But now that you have put it out there and she is aware hopefully you both can use this as a stepping stone towards evolving your relationship into having a more adult dynamic less defined by your birth order roles.  Also maybe a less emotional but frank discussion with your parents about how you feel is in order.  Without further information I\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt that they may be unaware as well and are just suffering from \u201cthis is how it\u2019s always been\u201d syndrome.\n\nAnd congrats on opening your own bakery!

Depending on how long your sister has been with her partner, and how much time difference in between family gatherings, your sister might have thought this was honestly the best time because she isn't sure when you will get together again next and was really excited about having a partner she really cares about. I know if I was with someone I really cared about and wanted my family to meet them...I would hate to have to wait 3-4 or more months to introduce them when I was ready to do it now just because someone might feel like I was overshadowing them. \n\nI guess I am probably an outlier in this thinking and will get downvoted...but I don't really think that having a get together in your honor means that no one else is allowed to have interesting things happening to them or have people ask them questions. I do think your sister's response was awful though. \n\nI think your family mostly all sucks though in that they ignored you and your bakery and amazing accomplishment all together. That was incredibly awful of them, because while I don't think the entire evening had to be about you, it definitely should have been a least somewhat about you. A toast in your honor, some questions about you, etc etc, something. You did a really amazing thing and congratulations about that! \n\nI would say though that you are only a really soft AH in this, because even though you have a valid reason to be angry about the way that night shook down, I think you are unfairly putting all the blame on your sister when most of the blame needs to be on your parents. As the overshadowed sibling in my family, I know that you ought to also talk to your sister and parents about the blatant difference in the way you are all treated. I did it, it was awkward, but it was important. Unfortunately, my mother didn't think anything was wrong of course, but at least my sister and I were able to have a more meaningful conversation about it. \n\nOf course your situation is different, maybe your sister truly is an egotistic person and loves all the attention so it's really hard to say, but purely from what I have read I have given my verdict because I know that while you are definitely in the right for feeling angry and hurt about this situation, from personal experience I know that nothing will change unless you make the first move. Also, that at least from personal experience, that while I felt more and more like I was being left out or ignored...I was also creating that for myself by simply refusing to participate once I began to feel left out. \n\nYour family has failed you, your parents in particular, and for that I am truly sorry.

That\u2019s a 100% normal thing that people do at family dinners. She\u2019s not at fault for taking her when there was 0 reason to expect it might create a problem. OP says \u201cshe knew what bringing a girlfriend would do to a dinner,\u201d \u2014 I highly doubt she did.

Don't know for sure but we do know it's s long time, long enough that OP has some resentment for her. If that's the case, the attention could be \"normal\" for her sister but that's not her sister's fault. That's on her parents for dedicating the dinner to OP but switching to Allison and her GF. OP's anger seems misplaced and should be on the parents.\n\nAlso OP said the parents were interested in the GF, not Allison. The GF even asked about her bakery. I think people are putting too much vitriol on the sister for things out of her control. The sister is an AH for dismissing OP's feelings and not showing empathy for her.

OP\u2019s parents do have some blame for the dynamic, but I can also see a situation where her mom said that the dinner would be in her honor as an aside that OP latched onto and then didn\u2019t communicate that information to the rest of the family.", "\"My mom invites the whole family for dinner once in a while and this time she said the dinner was in my honour\"\n\nThis set up reminds me of my uncle that throws a BBQ like once a month during the summer and if there's anything going on with the family someone will bring a cake or something. But I guess OPs mom could be into formal parties and made it very clear this is not like the other get togethers she hosts", "Christmas.", "She could have even worked in bringing the new SO to her bakery to draw attention back!

Yeah Allison is definitely not an asshole.", "That\u2019s dismissed to me. She didn\u2019t acknowledge she felt hurt at all. Just criticized her reaction", "Oh, that is absolutely still happening for me with familial relationships and dynamics. It just so happened that, in this instance, I could see it would be better for me to make an ally than an enemy.", "I have a sibling I haven't talked to for 3 years, and my sibling didn't notice for over a year. \n\nThere doesn't need to be a big declaration of \"I'm not speaking to you anymore\", just literally don't talk to them. \n\nThe only reason I spoke to this sibling at all was for the sake of relatives that I loved, but they have since died, so there's literally no reason to talk to them.", "But what would Alison\u2019s story be here?

It's not.about the siblings SO, it's about the siblings intent to bring the focus off her sibling and put her new relationship in the limelight.", "For MOST people, it isn't. But this sibling has been doing that to OP her entire life.  So it's not a single incident that could be chalked up as a misunderstanding, it's a life long pattern of behavior.", "Lol, yes it will. Gf is a psychologist, and should pick up on that pretty quick.", "She apparently has never had a standing girlfriend before so bringing this new development to the party effectively took the attention off OP and put it on Allison, who is also the golden child.

It\u2019s likely they would have given her more attention no matter what.", "Except, only the quest of honor (OP) get's to decide if the party was ruined.\n\nIf this had happened at OP's birthday and, when her sister and GF showed up, nobody wished OP a happy birthday, gave her a gift (all of the gifts went to the new couple for being in love), the cake meant for you was cut by the new couple in celebration, and it was something \"usual\" to celebrate there would be NO DOUBT that the party was ruined.\n\nJust because OP is an adult who, by the way, STARTED HER OWN BUSINESS, doesn't mean she shouldn't expect HER celebratory event to be focused on HER, and it doesn't mean she's wrong for voicing the hurt that it wasn't when SPECIFICALLY ASKED.\n\nHer sister should've realized that bringing her new partner would take the celebration away from the celebrant, and should have asked or done it the weekend before or after. Now, the sister probably doesn't realize how much resentment OP feels for consistently having their emotional needs neglected in favor of supporting OP's sister, BUT, she can't call OP the asshole for being honest and saying \"You just did the same thing you've done our entire life by making every good thing I did about yourself when you could choose literally any day that isn't supposed to be celebrating MY achievement instead of the ONE I wanted to be able to be the focus of.\"", "OP said in a comment that Allison knew.", "Um given the fact that OP states that Alison said she wanted her girlfriend to be a part of the celebration, uh yeah she knew", "IMO, if my sibling told me this and I was oblivious to the context and did everything unintentional, I would immediately apologise and offer to make it up in a different way - have another dinner or something. Not demand that they are happy for my happiness.", "Shes a passive bystander and 28. She\u2019s a grown adult and clearly smart because she got a law degree. It is the parents fault for creating this golden child dynamic. The sister does have a right to be excited to talk about her new partner. But she\u2019s still not blameless. She\u2019s an adult and should start recognizing how her sister gets treated differently. \n\nAlso- When I see someone I love sulking I usually try to include them in the conversation to cheer them up. But I could see your perspective and approach.", "Actually, it sounds like she only comes 2x a year. Once for Christmas and once for a dinner that her parents host. I get why OP feels hurt, and really, the family should\u2019ve done more to talk about the bakery or dedicate a toast to her new business venture. But realistically, her parents and brother have probably heard tons about the bakery already if they live in the same town. There\u2019s also clearly limited opportunities for Allison to bring Elizabeth around to introduce her. Bringing your girlfriend across the country to visit your parents is a big move. It\u2019s not something you do lightly and it is a clear communication to the family that this is a person that you\u2019re serious about. Elizabeth could have her own family that she visits at Christmas, so really the only opportunity for Allison to introduce the family to her serious girlfriend within the next year is at this dinner. Allison is 28, an age when a lot of people only date a person for maybe two years before getting married to them. It sucks that this is the way that things shook out, but this is one instance where I do not think this was an effort to truly upstage OP. There\u2019s just some practical realities with getting your serious partner introduced to the family while working a high hour demand job, and where your partner is likely also similarly bogged down. Sometimes that means you end up sharing the spotlight.\n\nI think that OP is just letting her resentment over years of being pushed the side color her entire perception of this dinner. I also think they were better ways to handle this than sulking. ESH.", "You absolutely could and should be able to hold space for happiness for both of them. It would be different if they were celebrating OPs pregnancy and the sister came and announced her own pregnancy or something, but sister did nothing except bring her serious partner to meet her family. These meetings in my experience don\u2019t need to be a whole event on their own. It\u2019s actually most awkward when you set out To Meet the Parents vs just bringing them to a different event.\n\nWhere the sister is wrong is where the parents are wrong too \u2014 they should have made more of an effort to bring the conversation back to OP. But yknow what? I know it\u2019s hard, but I wish OP had the backbone to say something at the table instead of holding it in and lashing out on her sister. OP could have used a lot of methods to bring the conversation back to herself. She could\u2019ve been honest and informed the group she\u2019s feeling disregarded. She could have been sarcastic and made some sly self deprecating comment to bring the groups attention to the fact that they\u2019ve forgotten about her. She could have just started talking about her own business unprompted and led the conversation that way. Of course it\u2019s awkward but it\u2019s better than flipping out on your sister who probably didn\u2019t even notice it was happening until it was over. OP should be upset with her parents more than anything, not with her sister or her girlfriend.", "If I brought home an SO and j got yelled at because that got attention I can see being annoyed too. While I think sister should have brought the attention back to the OP, it\u2019s not the or fault the rest of the family sucks. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s be real. If she\u2019s the golden child it wouldn\u2019t matter if she brought home an SO or not. The family would have found a reason to give the OP less attention. It\u2019s not fair or right, but if that\u2019s the family pattern I doubt it would have changed for that night.", "Just throwing this out there, what if she called her mom before hand to tell her she had a gf to which the mom invited the gf to the dinner to meet everyone else", "I think a full, blind commitment to OP\u2019s narrative is naive when there is so much resentment involved. Yes, I do know men like that. I don\u2019t know a lot of women like that, because generally speaking women flashing wealth and success is received differently than men doing so. There could definitely be exceptions, but I don\u2019t find OP\u2019s telling wholly reliable, given she took one major success of her sister\u2019s life and attributed it to her sex life. She doesn\u2019t even mention that her sister is a practicing lawyer. Just that she has the degree, which she supposedly uses for sex.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t make a big issue just block them.

I told her to get over it and be happy for me\"", "Idk, maybe people do things differently in different parts of the world, but, at least in my experience, in the American Midwest bringing a new significant other to an already established party to meet your family is extremely, extremely common. I think I\u2019ve met most of my SO\u2019s family this way and vice versa.\n\nI really don\u2019t think Allison did anything wrong here, but I think OP is still NTA for how she reacted. It\u2019s a very understandable reaction but I think her vitriol is just misplaced. Should be on the parents rather than the older sister.", "I usually dislike AITA posts going viral because posting to the Reddit community might not mean you want the world to know your drama but I would love it if it goes go viral, to get her perspective. \n\nI also think it\u2019s lazy to make money and get followed just regurgitating someone\u2019s post off Reddit. Even when buzzfeed writes an article, they better add more information or it\u2019s just laziness.", "My partner is the middle child but him, his elder brother and younger sister all think they are their parents favourite. I leave them with no doubt that as an outsider the dog is most definitely their parents favourite child.", "There's two types of favorites, the ones who reject the special treatment and the ones who crave the attention.", "Being the favorite tends to come with a lot of rules. So it's entirely possible the love he received felt to conditional for him to feel (more) loved.", "How is that at all reasonable?? I would never in a million years not bring my gf to a celebratory dinner for my sibling.\n\nDo you live in the real world?", "It's entirely possible for two things to be true at once.\n\nYes, I agree that OP might automatically look for these kinds of explanations for her sister's behavior based on past family dynamic. She might have automatically believed her sister was attempting to steal the spotlight no matter *how* her sister behaved at this dinner.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean her sister *wasn't* trying to do just that on this occasion. Maybe her sister really is prone to picking the most dramatic possible moment to make announcements, spring news on people, and otherwise highlight her life so that she can make sure the spotlight is on her and not whomever is nominally being celebrated. And maybe that *is* why she decided to bring a serious girlfriend home for the first time on this specific occasion.\n\nIn the end, I don't think OP is an *asshole* for her behavior. She maybe has some soul searching to do to work out how to handle this kind of thing better. For all we know, though, there is a long pattern of behavior that made her reaction and suspicion more reasonable than we know.", "Hard to say. There's a lot of history here we aren't getting, and I read further down that the sister only visits twice a year. \n\nI'd like to say I would, but I also feel like OP is putting the rest of the family's actions (not giving her enough attention) on Alison which hardly seems fair.", "That's why I said that the \"you should be happy for me\" didn't sit well for me. It didn't feel like it was an \"innocent mistake\" to bring the partner (the only partner she introduced to the parent, among many that she had) on the only time OP was being celebrated. You're right, OP's response could've been directed to the parents as well, but I don't think OP was in the wrong for saying why she was sulking when the sister asked. Because the reason was the sister, whether she intended or not.", "\n>I think a full, blind commitment to OP\u2019s narrative is naive when there is so much resentment involved.\n\nHow does that not apply to you as well?", "Everyone needs to get realistic too about what type of jobs these people work. If Allison is in Big Law or any firm where she is a slave to the billable hour, then at 28 years old, she\u2019s probably in her third year of practice. That is when you are deep in the proving grounds about whether you are going to be an associate that just fizzles out or if you possibly have what it takes to become a partner. Now granted, you wont get voted in as a partner for a long time, but usually by year three you can start to see who is likely to not make the cut. You also have litigation schedules to deal with. If Elisabeth is the same age, yeah, she\u2019s a psychiatrist, but she\u2019s probably still in residency or she just got out and is just starting to try to build a practice. These people are not the kind that have very flexible jobs where they can just take time off to come in any old time. It sounds like it worked out that this dinner was the dinner that they could come in for. It sucks that there was overlap, but sometimes that\u2019s just how it happens.", "I am from Iowa and the bringing of the GF home is obviously common. However, when it\u2019s a new GF and from someone that, supposedly, doesn\u2019t take relationships very seriously it\u2019s a HUGE deal. Also Allison has apparently shown a pattern of behavior in which she strives to be the center of attention at all things. These things combined someone could quite easily, and probably accurately, assume Allison brought the GF on purpose to get the attention off OP.  Not saying that was technically what happened here but it has a very strong chance. In that case, Yes Allison did something wrong.", "You reminded me of a convo between my friend and his sister who\u2019s 9 years older. When the sister was young, their dad was young and healthy and a good provider who was generous to his family. By the time my friend was born, the father\u2019s health had been wrecked by illness, his ability to work was sporadic, at best, and he was alcoholic and angry.\n\nSister described some lovely memories of family outings when she was small, and how loving her father was. My friend responded, \u201cI never met that man.\u201d It was sad, really. Sister\u2019s image of a loving dad remained intact, even after his health and behavior changed. I don\u2019t think she fully grasped how different her experiences were from those of her younger brother.", "I never said any of it was or was not reasonable, did I? I don't even see the word \"reason\" in my entire comment.\n\nAll I said was OP, the guest of honor, felt like the party was ruined when the party turned into a celebration of the new GF, and so, since OP was the guest of honor the party was supposed to be about (not her sister and the GF), the party was a failure/ruined, and whether or not you think it's REASONABLE those feelings are valid.\n\nThis obviously is not just about this singular incident. It is a lifetime worth of OP's sister upstaging her at her own events, getting paid more attention to, being favored, being praised more, having bad behavior (like sleeping/flirting w OPs friends) excused, and overall receiving attention that OP was neglected. \n\nThen, the ONE TIME that this might be an event about OP literally starting a bakery, which is extremely difficult, OPs sister decided THIS is the grand reveal event? How long have they been dating? Why could it not have been at Easter two months ago? Why, if that was too early, could they not have organized their own event and let OP have this ONE dinner where she is the main focus and not something or other her older sister did, like it has been their ENTIRE lives?\n\nOPs sister might not even realize the scale to which this has happened, because you don't if you aren't the one being neglected, but that doesn't mean the trauma and resentment OP is feeling is any less valid.\n\nAND OP wasn't even going to say anything about it!! She was directly asked BY THE PERSON who took the focus onto herself, and was honest. If the sister didn't want to know the real reason, even if it was hurtful, she shouldn't have asked, and I have a feeling she knew that bringing the girlfriend would be a big deal with a lot of attention, and it was intentional, otherwise I don't see a nearly 30 year old woman saying anything other that \"I'm so sorry, I just figured this would be a good time since we were all together. I didn't realize how hard it was growing up in my shadow.\"", "Necessary additional info from one of OP's comments is that OP lives in the same town as her parents, but her sister lives on the other side of the country and only visits twice a year. Once at Christmas, and once at one of these family dinners. So a very likely explanation for why she brought the girlfriend at this particular occasion is because... it's literally one of only two possible occasions a year (maybe even just one if her girlfriend plans to spend Christmas with her own family.)", "It sounds like the family were just being pleasant and interested in the new partner?...", "It seems more like the direct issue isn\u2019t even the sister. It\u2019s her girlfriend. The family wasn\u2019t asking sister how her job is, what\u2019s been going on, how\u2019s life -- they were asking about the new person at the table. But OP wasn\u2019t mad at the girlfriend, or even her parents it seems, just at the sister. That makes me feel like this all has way more to do with baggage from long term family dynamics and resentment towards her sister than any actual concrete issue from that day. Because of that, it makes sense to me why the sister, after noticing OP seemed unhappy and asked about it, responded defensively when OP went off on her. If you think about it from the sisters perspective that was probably very unexpected AND instead of a mature response, (eg: I\u2019m honestly feeling let down, I was looking forward to being celebrated for once and it felt like our parents cared more about your girlfriend than my success)  OP just basically went after the sisters character. Of course she was defensive. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to think the sister never viewed the situation this way. How likely is it that she\u2019s thinking, \u201comg, my family\u2019s gonna flip, this is the first girl I\u2019ve brought over, hahah they\u2019re so used to me being a player they\u2019re gonna go crazy for this, I can\u2019t wait for all the attention they\u2019re gonna give me\u201d vs \u201cahh I am a little nervous to bring this girl, I hope she feels comfortable, not sure what this is gonna be or feel like, I hope everyone likes her, I wonder what I should wear\u201d. Those are normal thoughts of a person introducing their partner to their family. Usually the partner is nervous too and needs support, so she was also probably preoccupied about that. I do think sister and the whole family was wrong to not even try to make it a point to congratulate and celebrate OPs accomplishment, but at the same time I really don\u2019t think the most likely scenario is that the sister was maliciously trying to steal the spotlight the way the OP says.", "You\u2019re on the right track imo.", "Yeah, this is a pretty normal situation that is getting blown up into this big thing because OP is letting years of resentment color her perception of what is going on at this dinner.

A wedding, a funeral, retirement, party, or other party, and so on.", "Except OP said that this sister is the golden child.

It\u2019s easy for family to want to do that, since I have a couple years head start on everything and tend to hit those big life milestones before my sister. That said, cos I\u2019m not a jerk, I deliberately and loudly celebrate when she accomplishes something, not out of guilt, but because I\u2019m genuinely super happy for her and I want her to be celebrated.\n\nAttention on everyone doesn\u2019t lead to less attention for yourself, it just means variety which makes everyone happier.

All 3 of my siblings think I'm \"mean\" to our father but I'm just giving him the respect he deserves, none. I'm not giving him extra privileges he never earned. \n\nThe other two understood when I asked \"do y'all remember what my childhood was like with him? I never GOT 'Nice Dad' like y'all did.\" But my oldest sister is in just straight up denial. I don't think she'll ever see it at this point. She's in denial about his turn into dementia too, idk if that's related or not", "I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s really hard, especially when children of difficult families so often try really hard to be perfect.", "It can also be true that OP's parents treat the sister as the golden child. It's not mutually exclusive with the attention received for visiting just twice a year. That could explain OP's resentment.", "I fully believe that the sister was the golden child growing up and as I said earlier, OP\u2019s resentment for that is very understandable. I\u2019m just saying that this resentment may be clouding her judgement, and causing her to read malicious intent from her sister right now where there is unlikely to be any.", "NTA. And as for being distant - why not stay that way? Do you really need this spot-light hogger in your inner circle?", ">Now Alison is a playgirl who uses her law degree to get laid\n\nI am stuck on this part - how tf does she do this??? I have had a law degree for 16 years and it's never once gotten me laid.", "NTA.. I am going to get downvoted for this but IDC... If your family can't actually care about you when they are \"celebrating\" YOUR accomplishments I would let everyone at the dinner know that there is no going to be no special treatment if they want anything from your bakery. No family discount, no last minute cakes or cupcakes and I would consider going LC.  \n\nmy mother turned my  birthday dinner a few years (which I planned myself) into Christmas for my half sister (not even my moms kid and she did not grow up with us) and my half sister's step daughter. I didn't even get any present so I sat there watching them open presents during my birthday while I had none. They didn't even pay for my meal my husband did. I have not invited them to celebrate my birthday with me since and I have been much happier.  My birthday is in the first week of January not actually during Christmas.", "Invisible middle child here of five. My eldest sister got more time and attention than all of the others put together. She practically ran the family. When she moved across the country, our mom was so devastated at her absence that holidays were miserable. When I was younger, I resented it, but then I realized that my sister had a lot of pressure and responsibility put on her, so much that she feels that she lost her childhood. There is a kind of freedom in invisibility that I embrace. It allowed me to move to another state without my mother \u201cdying\u201d of grief. Seek counseling if it helps. Forgive if you can. It sounds as if you are \u201cplanting your own garden\u201d with your bakery business, but don\u2019t spend too much energy on wishing others brought you better flowers.", "I'll tell you the same thing my mom told me about my feelings on being the unseen middle child. \n\nYou and your siblings are an Oreo cookie and you are the best part, the sweet creme filling.", "N T A\n\nAlso I'm petty, so I'd tell the girlfriend that your sister is toxic\n\nEdit: After reading you replies to questions in this thread? YTA. She comes home three times a year. Yeah, cool, the nights about you. But you talk about her literally introducing the gf any other night. But that's not true. She xant see her any other night, because she lives on the other side of the country  You live in the same town as your mother, you see her all the time\n\nYour sister doesn't. Yeah she sounds like an AH tbh with the remarks she made, but so do you", "\"Narcissist\" is so old hat, now Reddit hates \"golden child.\"", "If the first time ever bringing a partner over for a family event and introducing them is done during a celebration thrown for a sibling's accomplishment, it might not be the best moment to do so.\n\nBut that's just my two cents.", "My sister was the favorite, and we all knew it, including her, and she also apologized as an adult. I told her thank you for acknowledging it, but she hadn't done anything wrong. I just appreciated that she recognized it.", "Sorry, forgot psychiatrist and thought psychologist. Big difference.", "My kids think the dog is my favorite as well lol.", "That's a good point! As an only child, I haven't experienced the change in dynamics that accompanies the birth of another child into the family.\n\nBut I think that as long as each sibling has parents who are at least a close approximation to the parents of their other siblings, the parents are doing things right. (Presuming the parents are trying to do right by all the kids. If the parents are equally awful to all the kids, that's dreadful and wrong.)"]}
