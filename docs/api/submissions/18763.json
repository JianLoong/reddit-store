Focus on the actual assholes here--your parents.  They were the ones who made it all about Allison.\n\nNow, Allison should have enough social awareness to realize when she's being the spotlight-stealer.  But golden children often don't have this awareness.  I think when tempers have calmed down, you should apologize to her BUT also let her know how you have felt through the years.  It is possible that with the right conversation, she may see what you're talking about and thus be more of an ally to you.", "NTA.\n\nAnd may I say: impressive, opening a bakery at the age of 25. Why do your parents downplay that by call it 'a job'? You are an entrepreneur!

Yes it looks like you\u2019re being a brat but the minute you told Allison the truth, her empathy should have kicked in and said omg I\u2019m so sorry you felt like that at a dinner that was being thrown in your honour. What can I do? Instead she immediately says your feelings are wrong and should be about her. I would feel gutted if I took the spot light from my siblings accomplishments at their own dinner.

If so, it would be an a-hole move on sister\u2019s part to bring a surprise +1 to the party.

Your sister should have realized what this would cause, but I doubt it was of malicious intent. She should have asked you. What she did was thoughtless, but ultimately not horrible in my opinion. \n\nYour parents should have remembered who they were actually celebrating, I'd say it's actually just their fault for sidelining you. Wanting your gf to join family celebration is not bad, and the gf seemed to even be interested in what you do/direct the attention back to you as she asked about it.\n\nI understand how you feel, and it's completely natural. However, I think you could have been a bit more grown up about it and direct the anger to where it belongs: your parents. Maybe pull them aside and say um hello who exactly are we celebrating here. \n\nYour parents are the ones responsible for giving you their love as well. It's not your sister who needs to do something about the parents. She is not responsible for their utter failure. Asking her to tone it down so your parents can give attention to your achievements as well doesn't sound like a productive way to deal with this.

But also understandable considering it stopped people talking about your business.\n\nThe real assholes are your parents for making your sister the golden child, and when she brings her partner along, completely ignoring you and focusing on your sister and her gf. Your sister probably doesn't realise she's being treated like the golden child. So, probably lay off her. Even if she does, the parents are the ones actively ignoring you. It's their fault, not your sisters. Place the blame where it's due", "This is sorta tough, but I'll say ESH, referring to you and your parents.\n\nYour parents are assholes for pretty obvious reasons that everyone else has pretty much already told you in these comments. You, however, are also an asshole for choosing to hold so much resentment against your sister rather than your parents. Like, \"Alison is a playgirl that uses her law degree to get laid\". Seriously? That's your opinion of your sister?

They ALL should have treated the event properly.  Your sister is *maybe* a little insensitive to bring her new GF, but then again, it seems reasonable to bring her to a family event if it seems right.\n\nAfter that, is your sister, your parents, your brother who were ALL assholes for ignoring you and focusing on the new GF.  They should have been nice of course, talked with her, but kept the focus on what the actual event was for.\n\nSo NTA, but I'd say your anger should be more widespread to your whole family, not just your sister!  In a way at least she *noticed* that you were upset and asked about it, which none of the rest of your family did.", "Honestly it\u2019s probably not ever gonna change with your family.

This was your day.\n\nBut you also need to think about it this way, your sister has never not been center stage. She seems to simply want to be a part of the celebration, not hurt you by taking away attention. To her this was completely normal and is confused.\n\nThis isn't like many stories where she did it on purpose or with malicious intent, she just wanted to introduce her GF and didn't think beyond that.\n\nNo one's the AH in this situation IMO.\n\nEdit: After reading the comments I realize I forgot the parents. They are definitly the AH in this situation because it was their word that was given to you. They were the ones who promised to honor you and they threw you to the side when your sister arrived. \n\nI have little doubt that even if she hadn't brought her GF the parents would still make the night about \"Catching up\" with their out of town daughter\" \n\n(I like the rating system of rslash soooo) 2.5/5 buttholes for your parents 0.5/5 for your sister (what she did was still inconsiderate) and 0/5 for you, you had every right to be upset, just make sure it is pointed at the people who deserve it.", "Using a graduate degree to get into young women's pants... your sister is gross in a lot of ways, not just for ruining your dinner.\n\nCongratulations on your business!

How far? The way it's worded sounds like she can't just bring her home some other night, no?\n\nI think OP's feelings are valid, but also don't blame the sister.  If anything, maybe you should bring it up to the ones you're actually mad at, your parents, whom you've got this feeling of never being enough for.", "NTA, the parents are the AH here. They've enabled this all these years with no acknowledgement to your feelings whatsoever.", "NTA\n\nAnd ask your mother when you'll get your dinner.", "Probably bad timing with introducing the girlfriend to the family, but otherwise... it's completely normal, they're just talking.\n\nI get that you want more of the focus, but that doesn't always happen especially if there are more interesting things to talk about like a new gf being introduced (hence why it's bad timing)\nBut do you want them to just sit and talk about bakeries the whole time? You might have to take some initiative there because they don't know anything about it likely\n\n\nAnd either way, separate from all that, you seem to hold a lot of resentment, especially towards your sister\nI'm guessing here, but I'd imagine it's probably a pattern where she tends to be more outgoing and take more spotlight and it's probably always been that way\n\nIt's okay if you want to feel that attention and focus yourself, but you shouldn't resent your sister for it, and you definitely shouldn't be making disparaging comments about her intimate life\n\n\nIf you want to work past it, at some point I'd suggest you apologize to your sister for blaming her for something she didn't really even try to do, and then also tell her how you feel, and that you don't feel appreciated or focused on enough.\n\n\nThis isn't you vs sister.. it's just you and your sister, you're family.

Best of luck with it!   :)", "Aaaah!  Sibling dynamics!  It is amazing how much they stick even well into adulthood.  Even now that I\u2019ve hit the big 50 I, the oldest, still sub-consciously see my job as protecting and guiding my younger siblings.  I feel an almost pathological  responsibility to be the have-it-all-together leader in the bunch and I could see that being perceived as being a \u201cgolden\u201d child but that was never my motivation or intention.  I\u2019ve learned to step back from that position as my siblings are all fully capable adults with children of their own but these roles are hard to shake and there are some very interesting studies about how birth order affects us our whole lives.  \n\nMy point being, I agree that your sister may not have been aware of her golden child status and based on the information you provided I don\u2019t think she was purposefully trying to take your moment from you.  But I also don\u2019t think you were wrong to feel the way you did and I don\u2019t think you were wrong to express your feelings.  Just a very soft YTA for the way you did it.  Sulking is never a good way of communicating a need.  But now that you have put it out there and she is aware hopefully you both can use this as a stepping stone towards evolving your relationship into having a more adult dynamic less defined by your birth order roles.  Also maybe a less emotional but frank discussion with your parents about how you feel is in order.  Without further information I\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt that they may be unaware as well and are just suffering from \u201cthis is how it\u2019s always been\u201d syndrome.\n\nAnd congrats on opening your own bakery!

Like someone else said, it could be true. Everyone has that one thing they like to say about themselves in the hopes to impress someone else. *Everyone*. I've heard people use their charity work, degrees, jobs, even wild things like their disabilities to try and get laid. Though, to be fair, that latter example was a really skeevy type of guy. I'm pretty sure he wanted to guilt trip people into sleeping with him.", "She ain't asshole in any way. She gave that info to tell us why her sister wanted others to value this girl so much.", "Why are people picking up on this, it's entirely irrelevant", "Yes, when something is thrown in your honour to celebrate your achievements with you opening your new bakery, you do expect people to at least bring it up. Starting a new business is really hard and special. It deserves to be the topic of conversation for a minute at a dinner specially put on to celebrate it. \n\nShe isn\u2019t upset it isn\u2019t all about her, she\u2019s upset it wasn\u2019t about her at all. Does that make sense ?", "Does it sway your opinion that when OP brought her feelings to her sister, her sister immediately invalidated them and then said OP should be happy for her ? I think when you see someone hurt by your actions even if that wasn\u2019t your intent, you should show some empathy. She dismissed them completely and then tried to turn it back on OP. Her reactions shows her AH status.", "no one would question the law degree line if it were a man doing the same.", "My thought as well. Alison is 28. She is old enough to be kind and empathetic towards others. But she obviously just doesn't care. This sub does have moments of people recognizing when other people, including siblings, are not treated well. \n\nOP's response should have elicited a moment of behavioral recognition, embarrassment, and apology. And that's a best case scenario given the situation because in my mind, Alison should have already been cognizant enough of others/her sister to NOT end up in this situation to begin with. \n\nInstead, Alison did not apology, made it about herself again, tried to guilt trip OP/get OP to feel bad for her very valid feelings of being overlooked/being upset with Alison. \n\nI think Alison is TA here as well. \n\nParents have a difficult time treating their kids as anything other than the children they once saw us even in adulthood; it is often up to the children to try to establish new boundaries and force them to recognize the change and agency of their children. Not fair, but often how it works. This falls on Alison to help out her sister and not be shitty. She fed into the dynamic instead.", "OP told Alison about her feelings and Alison dismissed it. I think she is an active participant not a passive by stander", "Sister\u2019s girlfriend(***) literally also mentioned the actual reason they were there once and accepted all the attention, sister instead was telling OP that actually they should be happy for her instead of upset the dinner got ruined. Sister loves the attention and thrives off of it\n\nEdited - sister is more pretentious than I originally thought", "Fair point. I was only considering OP vs sister, but you're totally right.", "I said \"I don't think\" not \"I definitely know\". I can't know someone's whole life story and family dynamic from a couple of paragraphs. Maybe you're right, maybe I'm right. I did not mean to invalidate or condescend and I'm sorry if I did. I just got the impression from the story that the OP's anger should be directed to at her parents.", "I like how you say they made that up and then proceed to make up your own story of what is going on lol. Could be projecting your own \u201cmean sister\u201d situation possibly?", "No, of course it's second-best.  But given a choice between second-best and being unhappy with nothing...?", "How does having a law degree help? \"I'm a lawyer, let me check your briefs...\"?\n\nIt sounds petty and mean and I think OP has a lots of negative emotions about their sister, TBF I think the parents are causing this.", "I voted for ESH, so no it doesn't sway. Yes she acted badly, my point is that everyone did. Sounds to me like she got defensive over something she couldn't control. It wasn't her fault but what she did was not nice. It was the parents fault for not understanding how tone deaf they acted. But she should have anticipated this / asked. And yes probably reacted better too.", "Yup that's even worse.", "I think so too. At 28 she\u2019s old enough to take the blame for her actions, whether her parents are the reason for them or not. Both the parents and Alison are TA.", "Plus, you know if you're a favoured child. I used to be the favourite child, and the treatment I received when compared to my sisters made it very obvious.     At least acknowledge how unfair it is on OP.", "Unfortunately that\u2019s how it goes. The favorite child often doesn\u2019t realize it, and when they finally realize they\u2019ve been poisoned and brainwashed and will take the privileges at the expense of other siblings", "Sister\u2019s girlfriend was actually the one who mentioned it once, not the sister.", "It doesn't look like she says \"the reason why we came is because you should be happy\". But rather it was a response to \"wtf did you bring your partner\" - \"it's because we're in love, you should be happy for me and not jealous\".\n\nDinner wasn't ruined, was it? Everyone else enjoyed it. It was ruined for OP. Because her parents give no shit about her.", "I don't know, the \"you should be happy for me\" doesn't sit well with me. If it's a celebratory meal for OP, which should the happiness be directed to the sister? If OP should be happy for her sister, why can't it be the other way around as well, specially because the focus of the meal would've been OP?", ">I said \"I don't think\" not \"I definitely know\"\n\nMaybe you should try basing your judgements on stuff you actually know, then, not whatever you can make up about the situation.", "Certain types of people are attracted to successful people with money. That's how.", "ACK! That\u2019s even worse to me omg. Thank you for bringing this up", "\u201cI wanted my girlfriend to be apart of this celebration and you should be happy for me because I\u2019m happy. Your celebration being ruined because I wanted my girlfriend to be here and not for one of my celebrations is NOT my fault. It\u2019s actually your fault for being upset and our parents liking me more\u201d", "Well she said law degree not lawyer. Seems she may not be practicing and not have success and money directly due to the degree. \n\nNot all lawyers have money or are the \u201cSuits\u201d stereotype  - speaking from a trainee lawyer in the UK who works in the immigration field.", "Sorry, I didn't know you were there and heard what she said.", "If she's manipulative with this information, I could see having a law degree working in the same way as being an actual lawyer. If she's just trying to get laid, she can use the fact she has that degree to imply she'll be successful in the future. Make them think she likes them and that they'll have a bright financial future together. Depends on what kind of person the sister is.\n\nOf course, this is all hypothetical. We only have OPs side, so she might not use her degree this way at all. But I can see how it can be done.", "Sorry I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t read the last paragraph, or you can and somehow perceived it differently than I did?", "Agreed! \n\nIt makes me sad when people assume law degree = money. Wish I was swimming in cash but alas!", "This speech isn't in there. Only that sister told that OP should be happy for her. All the rest is what OP thinks. Sister didn't say any of that.\n\nWhen someone complains WTF you bring your partner to your mother's house, it's very natural to answer that typically people are happy for their siblings. It's absolutely appropriate and acceptable to come with your girlfriend to your mother for family dinner."]}
