You've been dating this guy six months and he's ignoring your concerns and boundaries (with your food in your home), he just goes into your fridge and helps himself.

Sit down and discuss the monthly cost difference. My once son was buying extra points of meat at work to easily make his meal at home not realizing that he was paying 10x more per pound. With just a little prep and a freezer, you could save a ton and eat like a king with a plan and with time to cook. \n\nA fun date night could be talking about his monthly budget and yours, going out shopping together with his budget, and working together cooking for a date showing how the pre-made meals work for the week. This changed my son's life. If he doesn't want to do this or learn, let him go as it is time to grow and become the couple you should be or want to be.

Honestly, this is probably not the only thing he will be childish about. \n\nAlso, he hasn't taken you out on a proper date?

Its up to you to decide if you can continue feeding him or if its time to step away from the relationship as he's indicated he won't stop.", "If he isn't amazingly good in bed I suggest dumping him and then go looking for an adult to date. Thinking other people should feed you is one of the marks of a child.", "NTA, he is mad because he knows you were 100% right. He either didn't realize what he was doing (which I highly doubt, seems like something you just push to the back of your mind until you can't get away with it anymore) or he is insecure about the fact you can afford food that he can't, and got flustered with the conversation. There's no way that he can't undertand the imbalance between eating all of your expensive food, and just sharing a meal with you or some snacks. You don't raid anyone's fridge for all the leftovers when you go to someone's house. It's nice he likes your leftovers, but they're YOUR leftovers. Personally I find it strange to eat anyone's leftovers without asking, their existence alone implies someone saved them for later consumption. That in itself should tell anyone that they need to ask, well that and it being your home. He's just been doing whatever he can get away with, because it's easier for him, and while he may have other issues that are allowing him to rationalize his behavior, it doesn't actually excuse it. Good luck OP, hopefully he comes back with an apology and changed behavior, if not I would rethink the relationship. (If you aren't already.)\n\n\nETA: the attitude he has about this situation also reminds me of say, someone with depression who's forgetful and wants to do better but is stuck in their habits. If this is the case, he could be mad because he keeps being talked to about this issue and never does better by you/himself, and could be more mad at himself than he is at you. It still doesn't make his behavior okay though, and he needs to learn to work through his issues in a way that doesn't also cause you harm.", "NTA. Your \"boyfriend\" isn't an actual boyfriend. He's an actual mooch. A parasite. Give him his walking papers.", "I agree with this take.  He's using you and you deserve to be treated better.  You've told him to stop many times and he's blowing you off.  That means he doesn't care.  When someone tells you they don't care, believe them.\n\nNTA.  Dump the mooch.", "Op, he's using you for food.", "I\u2019ve offered to go shopping with him  and buy the foods and I\u2019ll show him how to cook and he\u2019s just complained my food is too expensive and cooking takes too much time. But he\u2019s ok with eating all my food once it\u2019s made", "Yeah ofcourse everybody likes fresh made tasty food i would say the same haha.\nBut is this a quality you can live with because i dont know if he will change. Even if he has money he isn't gonna cook", "Keep some boxed mac n cheese and microwave popcorn in your cupboard.  Sell it to him for $1 a box when he comes over hungry.", "Yeah I doubt he will change. His issue is not only the cost but also the effort that goes into cooking. He is probably too lazy to do it or just hates cooking. He will likely want a spouse/partner who does all of the cooking. If this is not something OP is willing to do in the future, if they decide to move their relationship forward, they should probably call it quits now.", "Oh I love this answer so much\ud83d\udc4c"]}
