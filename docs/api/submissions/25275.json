{"id": 25275, "submission_id": "15ygimy", "title": "AITA for leaving my son\u2019s wedding early?", "selftext": "My son, Alan (26M) has just recently gotten married to Helen (25-26F). I love them both very much. It\u2019s relevant to mention that I really dislike parties and large gatherings, I\u2019m not sociable at all and I really just dislike them. So it was kind of a downer when I heard that Alan and Helen were going to have a wedding with around 150 people. I told Alan ahead of time that I would probably leave early and that me and the rest of our family would take two cars so that they could stay if they wanted to. He looked like he didn\u2019t mind at the time. So at the wedding itself, after the ceremony I basically told him that I was glad and it looked great but I was going to go home. He asked if I was going to at least stay for cake or for food but the food didn\u2019t look all that appetizing to me so I told him I was just going to leave. He said \u201calright whatever just go\u201d and I went back to my table to get my stuff. I told my wife and she said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving back alone (the venue was very far from us and the roads there were not great). I said in that case she should come with me and after some hemming and hawing she agreed. So we left.\n\nThen two days later Alan\u2019s new wife bombarded me and my wife with messages that she was disgusted with us, saying horrible things about us and insulting us as people and as parents. Really just sickening. I told her off and asked why she thought it was okay to talk to her in laws like that and she said that us leaving \u201cruined\u201d the wedding for Alan and that he was very upset for the rest of the night. She continued to berate us. I politely told her to leave us alone and called Alan, mainly to inform him that his wife had a temper that he should know about.\n\nWhen we talked about it he basically started berating me too and said things like \u201cyou always do this\u201d and \u201cjust leave me alone\u201d before hanging up. I feel like I\u2019m justified since I told him ahead of time that I wasn\u2019t going to stay. AITA here?\n\nEdit since so many people care about the details: Yes there was a mother son dance planned. Yes he included me in the count for the food costs. Yes I love him. No this does not mean that I do not care about him.", "created_utc": 1692733862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ygimy/aita_for_leaving_my_sons_wedding_early/", "score": 6098, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What an absolutely disgusting lack of love and respect from you as a parent.\n\nYou also strong armed your wife into leaving too so your son had no parents present at his reception.\n\nHow you don\u2019t see that you\u2019re the AH is a mystery to me", "YTA. \"Leaving early\" doesn't mean \"not going to the reception at all,\" and taking your wife along with you was even worse.\n\nYou need therapy for this level of antisocial behaviour, especially since you don't even seem to understand why you're in the wrong.", "YTA - The fact that he's telling you \"you always do this\" strongly suggests that this recent blow up isn't just about the wedding, but, ignoring that, this is one of the most important days in your son's life so far, and you couldn't even be bothered to stick around for the toast? Did you *make* a toast to the couple? Typically the father of the groom dances with the bride and makes a toast to the couple, welcoming the bride to the family, thanking the guests for coming, and offering some heartfelt warm wishes/advice to the couple. \n\nI mean, the fact that your response to the whole thing was \"meh, the food didn't look that good to me, so we bailed and I took his mother with me\" speaks volumes to the relationship here. If the food had looked better, you'd have stuck around? But you wouldn't stick around when your son is clearly indicating to you that he wanted you to stick around a little longer? That right there makes you 100% the AH here.", "100% YTA. It\u2019s your son\u2019s wedding and no matter how uncomfortable you feel, it\u2019s your duty as a father to be there. It\u2019s one evening. Suck it up man.", "YTA\n\nMy \u00ab\u00a0dad\u00a0\u00bb did this at my wedding. I begged him crying to stay, I didn\u2019t get a father/daughter dance. \n\nIt\u2019s been 19 years and I am still not over it. We have basically no relashionship anymore.", "YTA. \n\nYou missed all of the traditional wedding reception things. You didn't make a speech, your wife didn't dance with your son. He didn't have his parents there to celebrate with him, even for an hour or two. You didn't express love just a \"hey you look great but I am going to leave\" and then you dragged your wife with you all because you couldn't be bothered to give him two hours of your time at his WEDDING.", "YTA. This was your son's WEDDING day. Do you honestly have no sense of what is the expected behavior of the parents of the groom? Hint: staying through dinner is the bare minimum.\n\nEdit: Your responses are making me so sad, because it seems like you genuinely don't care about your son's feelings at all. My own dad is very shy and introverted, and he worked so hard to put a speech together for my wedding and be friendly and sociable at the reception even though I told him he didn't have to. He said, \"You've always made me proud and today I want to make you proud.\" I wish everyone could have such a wonderful dad.", "YTA - your kid had a big event in their life and wanted you to celebrate with them in a way that felt good to them. You were not willing to face a bit of social discomfort to honor that wish, and your son feels like you didn't prioritize his feelings... and you didn't. His new wife, while I don't agree with the method of communication, was trying to stick up for him by letting you know how your actions made him feel. Instead of calling your son to apologize for how you made him feel, you called to tattle on his new wife?? HONESTLY, get a grip - this day was not meant to be about you. \n\nYou left immediately after the ceremony - you did the bare minimum to cover your ass in saying \"I attended my son's wedding\" - but you didn't actually participate. In addition to that, it sounds like your wife wanted to stay, but was made to leave in order to get home safely...? \n\nSo it sounds like the only person who gets prioritized in your family is you...", "Wow. When your son stops speaking with you, remember his wedding. Oh, wait - you were barely there. Regardless, YTA.", "YTA get over yourself.", "YTA.  You didn't leave the wedding early, you left right after the ceremony.  It wasn't just one party, hopefully his only wedding and his parents abandoned him.  I can't imagine how embarrassing it was as speeches, cake cutting and the first dance occurred, other guests rightly looking for the groom's parent's who couldn't be adults for one day and suck it up.", "YTA. At first I thought you meant leaving early - like the wedding reception started at 6 and you would leave around 9/9:30. But you basically only attended the ceremony and couldn\u2019t suck it up to celebrate your son\u2019s wedding and marriage for a couple hours.", "YTA\n\nThis was your son's wedding. The. Not only did you leave but you took your wife with you. So your son didn't have either of his parents there to support him during one of the biggest moments of his life!\nAnd since you left b4 the food i assume he didn't get to do the mother son dance!\n\nDespicable!", "YTA. The 2 of you couldn't even stay for dinner, nothing? You just peace'd out the second you could sprint to the car? Of course your son is going to be hurt that you can't bother to share in one of the biggest days of his life, if even for an hour or so.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you are not interested enough in your kid to invest ONE evening in his wedding?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo your wife just left without ewven saying goodbye? Even worse than you.", "YTA she's right and no, your son doesn't have to get his wife under control like a rabid animal. Get a grip, you're not the only person on this planet or closer circle.", "So, the deciding factor was that the food didn't look appetizing.\n\nThis wasn't just a party, it was a wedding celebrating a marriage for your son. This once-in-a-lifetime event will be without memories and photos of your son's parents because you skipped out and dragged your wife with you. \n\nI'm sad that your love for your son wasn't enough to keep you at this event, but really happy he found a wife who has enough love to stand up for him.\n\nAbsolutely YTA.", "YTA. The fact that you couldn\u2019t suck it up one time at your sons wedding, but that you also forced his mother to leave, is despicable. And from what your son said, I think this is not the first milestone day in his life that you missed.", "YTA I don't love huge gatherings either, but you couldn't have made more effort for your son getting married?", "YTA.  You REALLY couldn't be pleasant and just be there for your son for a couple of hours?  So the food didn't look good to you - so what!  It's ONE day and you couldn't manage it.  Yes, you're the AH.", "Info - at what point did you leave the wedding? Had the speeches and dancing happened?", "YTA\n\n She was right", "YTA", "YTA - you should have set your personal dislike of large events aside for your son on such a special occasion and huge event in his life.", "YTA Look I hate socialising too! Hate it ! But there\u2019s no way in hell I left my kids wedding !!! I was able to handle the discomfort for one night ! Generally it\u2019s the least a parent can do !!", "I get it, I don't like socialising either.  When my brother and his fianc\u00e9e announced their engagement I admit my heart sank because I knew it meant a big wedding which I'd have to attend.\n\nSo you know what I did?  I acted like an adult, sucked it up and went to the wedding because I love my brother and his now wife.  That's what you do for people you love.  The thought of leaving prematurely never crossed my mind.\n\nIf your social anxiety is so bad that you miss your son's wedding reception then you really need some therapy to address it.  Actually you should have addressed it before the wedding so you could at least have tried to not let your son down.\n\nYTA", "YTA. No further words required.  \nMy heart was broken when my mom didn\u2019t come to see my dress but this takes the \u201cYTA of the year award\u201d.", "YTA, and a selfish one at that. Plus, you're  not being honest. Which is it - your dislike of social occasions or the fact that 'the food didn't look all that appetizing\"? You would stay if the food looked good, but not to support your son and celebrate his marriage? How callous.\n\nCriticizing the food adds insult to the injury of not attending your SON's wedding reception.", " YTA Super shameful behaviour.", "YTA - you couldn\u2019t get over yourself for one night for your son?", "YTA.  It was his WEDDING. Probaby one of the most important events in his life.  You didn\u2019t stay for dinner, mother/son dance, speeches.  You said you left right after the ceremony.  Did you even take pictures with them?  And from your son\u2019s initial reaction, you\u2019ve done this to him before.  I wouldn\u2019t worry about getting invited to anything related to grandkids.  He won\u2019t want them disappointed and he has an additional family now.  I just hope you didn\u2019t ruin his relationship with his mother.  And the fact that you can\u2019t or won\u2019t see his point of view is sad.  I\u2019m so happy that he found a woman who will be there to support him when you let him down again.", "YTA\n\nWhen making up an AITA post you have to give the narrator at least one good quality.\n\nYou went full asshole; never go full asshole.", "YTA, out of all of the events skipped or left\u2026you couldn\u2019t compromise once for your son\u2019s wedding? \n\nYour need to be right has far eclipsed your common sense \u2014 and you\u2019ve ruined your relationship with your son. This is really sad.", "YTA", "Complete and total asshole. You. YTA.", "YTA get over yourself. It was the most important night of your sons life.", "You sounds like the child more than a parent who\u2019s child just got married. You have to come here to ask, thinking your dislike for social situations like many redditors, would make what you did better? YTA", "YTA. Does giving someone a heads up that you're going to be an AH make you less of an AH?", "YTA. It is utterly bizarre that you think you're entitled to withhold your support for your son on one of the biggest days of his life because he failed to cater his wedding plans to your very specific needs. Even so, I wasn't ready to come down either way until you disclosed that you got your wife to leave with you, functionally depriving your son of *any* parental figures at his own wedding.\n\nYour son doesn't exist to support your emotional needs and comfort. You brought him into the world, it is your job to support him nearly unconditionally. And you decided, nah, the food didn't look good enough for you to bother being a parent. How dare he not support *your* needs. Gross. I'm not at all a fan of this style of selfish \"parenting.\"\n\nDon't be surprised if he doesn't talk to you or your wife for years or ever again. If my parents did that to me at my wedding? I wouldn't.", "YTA. If I was your wife I would have stayed and gotten an Uber home. If by chance that it was in a rural area where there aren\u2019t any Uber I would go to a hotel and drive home next morning.

Like you will be.", "YTA - I HATE crowded places, I dislike most weddings, because I find many wedding games cringe, it takes too long, I dont want to small talk with people or get to know new people there. I dont like the music that is played on most weddings, Im not religious so I dislike the church part as well.\nSocial interaction with people that dont share my hobbies and interests is rly tiring to me, but I would never ever leave my sons wedding THAT early.\nYour son and his wife are most likely completly right about whatever they called you. You did indeed ruin one of their most special days. I could not emjoy my wedding, if my parents would leave so early and basically Show me, that they do not care.\n\nIf I would expect that behaviour, I would not even invite them in the first place...\n\nHow can you not see that damn =[", "YTA. You didn't \"leave early.\" You skipped the entire reception, and took the groom's mother along with you for good measure. \n\nMy four-year-old is less self-involved than this.\n\nNot only did you crush your son on his wedding day, it was probably humiliating to be asked over and over where his parents were.", "YTA", "YTA- my mum hates gatherings of more than her immediate family members, she however stayed for the entirety of my wedding because she knew how much it meant.\nIt\u2019s a piss poor excuse", "YTA\n\nI'm as introverted and asocial as they come, and I absolutely hate parties. But sometimes you just grit your teeth and participate, because it matters to the people you love.\n\nAnd your son's wedding is definitely an occasion where you just get it together and socialize for a handful of hours.", "YTA. It\u2019s your sons wedding. And it doesn\u2019t matter that you always do this. Clearly you\u2019ve upset your son by doing this before and you don\u2019t seem to care.", "YTA. It's his wedding. He wanted you there. You could have stayed at least an hour or two if it made you that uncomfortable. My mate's dad isn't big on parties but he remained at the table with his partner during her wedding reception and only spoke to those who approached him. You didn't 'go home early'. You refused to attend their reception. \n\nAs far as I'm aware, you usually pay per head for the catering.

I would be.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s fine if you wanted to leave early but\u2026there\u2019s early and then there\u2019s this. Leaving early generally means staying for the dinner, cake, speeches and first dance and parent dances and then leave. That\u2019s making an effort.

It is not immediately after the ceremony. You did not make your intentions clear to Alan when you told him you'd be \"leaving early\".

I can't believe you don't get it. ask your wife - maybe she knows.", "YTA. My cousin's father is an introvert with extreme social anxiety. My cousin had a large wedding bc he has a lot of friends and family. His dad sucked it up and made it through dinner and the cake, and everyone was happy.

I feel the least you could have done was spent the day with them. It's only 1 day out of the whole year and it was a very important one for him.\n\nOf course he would be upset that you and your wife left early.

I love them both very much. It\u2019s relevant to mention that I really dislike parties and large gatherings, I\u2019m not sociable at all and I really just dislike them. So it was kind of a downer when I heard that Alan and Helen were going to have a wedding with around 150 people. I told Alan ahead of time that I would probably leave early and that me and the rest of our family would take two cars so that they could stay if they wanted to. He looked like he didn\u2019t mind at the time. So at the wedding itself, after the ceremony I basically told him that I was glad and it looked great but I was going to go home. He asked if I was going to at least stay for cake or for food but the food didn\u2019t look all that appetizing to me so I told him I was just going to leave. He said \u201calright whatever just go\u201d and I went back to my table to get my stuff. I told my wife and she said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving back alone (the venue was very far from us and the roads there were not great). I said in that case she should come with me and after some hemming and hawing she agreed. So we left.\n\nThen two days later Alan\u2019s new wife bombarded me and my wife with messages that she was disgusted with us, saying horrible things about us and insulting us as people and as parents. Really just sickening. I told her off and asked why she thought it was okay to talk to her in laws like that and she said that us leaving \u201cruined\u201d the wedding for Alan and that he was very upset for the rest of the night. She continued to berate us. I politely told her to leave us alone and called Alan, mainly to inform him that his wife had a temper that he should know about.\n\nWhen we talked about it he basically started berating me too and said things like \u201cyou always do this\u201d and \u201cjust leave me alone\u201d before hanging up. I feel like I\u2019m justified since I told him ahead of time that I wasn\u2019t going to stay. AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA", "To elaborate: Getting married is typically viewed as one of the most important days of someone's life, usually listed alongside a graduation or a child's birth. Common practice is to include your parents in that day and for them to attend both the ceremony and reception. While certain emergencies and issues may result in a parent not being able to attend the event or part of the event, \"I don't like parties\" is generally seen as a very weak reason given the importance of the event. Attending is the symbol and demonstration of your love and respect for your child. Skipping a Labor Day BBQ because you don't like parties is the kind of thing people would probably back you up on. Skipping your child's wedding reception, particularly when you also pressured their other parent to leave, is an AH move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion: Are weddings not seen as a big event in your family? Did your parents voluntarily skip your wedding as well?", "It wasn't your day. Moreover, it was a once in a lifetime day. It was **your son's wedding**.

Big time.", "One single party lol it\u2019s your kids wedding and you showing him how much you truly do not care about him. YTA", "As other people have pointed out, this isn't just a party. Since you dislike parties and seem to think they're all the same, let's go over why this matters.\n\nThis was your son's wedding. Hopefully his only wedding. It was the day he chose to blend his life with his new wife's. Since you're married yourself, perhaps you can remember this being a joyful occasion. Being excited to start your new lives together. Looking forward to what you would do as a couple. Wanting to celebrate and share those feelings with the people closest to you. \n\nYour response was \"whatever it's just a party, I can always catch the next one.\"\n\nThere are several issues with this mentality:\n\nFirst off, judging from your son's words, you won't catch the next one. It sounds like you have a habit of avoiding your son's milestones if they don't perfectly fit into what you feel like doing. If this was a one-off, you could chalk it up to miscommunication, but instead it seems like just part of a larger pattern of behavior. One that has shown your son, for years, that what's important to him is not important to you. He has told you his problems very clearly and you seem to not care, and to value your own comfort above making your loved ones happy. Which is your prerogative, but certainly makes you an asshole.\n\nSecondly, the whole \"catch you next time\" attitude almost certainly rubbed Helen the wrong way, and for good reason. By ducking out before the reception, you basically showed her that you don't care about her joining the family. It's quite likely she thinks that you disapprove of her directly, or even that you think her marrying your son was a mistake, and you're just waiting until he meets the right one to actually bother sticking around. What a horrible impression to give a daughter-in-law that you claim to love. Was it rude of her to read you the riot act over the phone? Sure, but it also seems quite warranted.\n\nThirdly, you took your wife with you when you left. She did not want to leave that early, but you used her discomfort with the situation to manipulate it to your advantage and leave your son not just without you, but without his mother, on his wedding day. Why did it not occur to you to find a different solution, like calling a cab or having a family member drive with your wife? What was the point of taking separate cars if you were going to insist on having your way? This also speaks to a larger pattern of behavior; I suspect your son has become accustomed to not being able to depend on either of his parents to support him when it mattered. He thought you might be able to do it just once, for the most important day of his life to date, and his hopes were dashed yet again.\n\nSince you're so concerned with your own comfort above all else, I have to wonder why you had a child to begin with. You seem to have missed the memo that parents put their children's happiness first. You could probably benefit from some therapy to work out why you feel this way if you feel like remaining in your son's life. But it also sounds like you don't care much one way or another - and if that's not true, note that that's absolutely the message your behavior sends - so you can shrug it off and enjoy your hermitage. Just please do let your wife dictate her own schedule going forward.", "\"over leaving one single party early?\"\n\nIt isn't really a party though, it's a wedding.

I made small talk for a few hours and ate snacks while taking sporadic breathers outside to decompress. Was it fun? Not really. But she\u2019s my bestie and I love her. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not fun or comfortable, it\u2019s literally once in a lifetime (hopefully). I didn\u2019t complain and told her I had a great time. Want to know why? Because I care about her and my desire to be there in her moment of joy is way bigger and more compelling than my discomfort. \n\nI would definitely assume the same for a **child**.

Is it going to be horribly anxiety provoking? Yes, but I\u2019m still doing it because I love him and I\u2019m capable of using strategies to get myself through it. \n\nOP could\u2019ve stayed for just a bit of the reception, or found someplace to take a break from socializing in between the ceremony and reception, but it seems they simply didn\u2019t care enough to try to find any solution other than leaving.", "I also have a hard time in crowds and that\u2019s pretty much my game plan too!

I go to a quiet far bathroom or an outdoor walk around the venue or yard. Folks would rather I disappear for ten minutes at a time than leave completely. Same situation for when you have young kids who can\u2019t sit still for church, events, big gatherings, graduations, etc\u2026 you always just take the kid outside for a bit and let them get their bearings.", "Ya they didn\u2019t \u201cleave early\u201d they essentially missed half their kids wedding.", "Yep!  My fil didn\u2019t handle gatherings well and would take a separate car. But he stayed until food was served, speeches were made and cake was cut. He didn\u2019t stay for dancing and the socializing. But everyone knew this and we made sure to do all the stuff early so he could easily leave without making a scene.", "I have a feeling it will be last thing that he misses, as he simply won't be invited anymore. Son and DIL will cut them off, and he will wonder why they are not invited to events he doesn't even want to go to anymore.", "My petty heart is cheering on the wife for having a go at OP for being such an asshole.

But I\u2019m glad she did.", ">The fact that you left before the mother/son dance or the speeches speaks volume.\n\nThat's the kicker to me. I totally think it would have been okay to leave the reception early-all that stimulation can really wear ppl out. But to not even stay for a little bit, and to not even try to come up with a different plan so he's not guilting his wife into leaving before that dance, is so disrespectful. The ceremony shouldn't have tired him out enough that he had to leave immediately once it was done-he could have absolutely sucked it up and sat through and hour or two of the reception before dipping.", "If someone said to me \u201cI might leave early\u201d at my wedding I would assume they meant just after all the planned stuff was done - ceremony, meal, speeches, cake, planned dances etc. I would never assume they meant as soon as the ceremony was over unless they explicitly stated that", "Well, Dad has never been there anyways.  So the son wasn\u2019t surprised that Dad dumped on him AGAIN. But he was disappointed.", "Yes! A wedding is usually just once in a lifetime for a person so if it wasn\u2019t a true emergency, why would he leave? He literally left in the middle of his son\u2019s most important day in his life and then complained about the meal they PAID for that he didn\u2019t even take a single bite of and then got mad when they called him out for it. Complete AH of a father and father-in-law. I don\u2019t really like social events either but if I had a son and he was getting married, I\u2019d be in the front fucking cheering.

It seems so demeaning to me.", "And the fact that he said the wife has a \"temper\" instead of looking at it as the wife looking out for her husband because she saw how upset he was. I think she's a fantastic wife!", "Well, he also bullied his wife into doing what he wanted so his attitude towards women in general seems pretty clear.", "Very much \"keep you woman in check vibes\".  No acknowledgement that he might be wrong or that his son might have been hurt, just a phone call to tell his son to get his wife in line because she had the nerve to speak to her elders like that.", "Probably how he views and treats his own wife.", "I once went to a wedding where the Father of the Groom changed into crocs as soon as he could (it was a really nice venue) and then flew home to Alabama right after the reception.

So much so that I didn't even have my own wedding because the thought of all of that was paralyzing. \n\nThat being said, I've attended several weddings, in their entirety, for people I care about. Because that's what you do! When someone you love invites you to share one of the most monumental and special days of their lives, you fucking suck it up and go. For the whole thing! You can maybe get away with slipping out after dinner, after the father daughter dance, or mother son dance in this case, after cake, speeches. Whilst everyone starts partying you can maybe then begin to say your goodbyes. \n\nLeaving literally immediately after they said \"I do\" is a dick move. It clearly shows that he doesn't value his son's feelings. \n\nHis son saying \"you always do this\" speaks volumes. \n\nSounds like OP is the type of father who provided financial support during childhood but is completely emotionally handicapped.

I was sad I missed the cake but I was already asleep at home by the time they cut it :(", "I was in a pretty deep bout of depression on top of not being thrilled with crowds, loud noises, or people getting drunk.

Then spent the next week in a hotel searching for apartments to get away from this monster. The fact that she and her son had a dance planned and everything and she still relented makes me think that he's not only a terrible father, but a terrible husband, too.

Right after the ceremony?  And you're the parents of the groom?  Come on.", "The son didn\u2019t seem bothered because this shitty behavior has been happening his entire life! \n\nDad is going to get his wish and have more time to be alone.

I will stand up in a wedding if I'm asked, and my wife (who is pretty introverted) and I will go to weddings, because we love and respect our loved ones.

Leaving just after the reception? Incredibly rude, even if he was just a normal guest that has had a meal paid for by the bridal party because they RSVP'd yes. For a parent to do that? So unspeakably rude.\n\nEasy money is on the DIL seeing how much it affected her new spouse and that's why she's messaging them \"sickening\" things (probably these sickening things are nicer than what strangers on the internet are saying about him when they get his side of the story).

My husband's grandfather uses a wheeled walker so everything was accessible already. She didn't have much of an appetite but she packed a couple protein shakes that I didn't care if she ate instead.

OP didn't care enough.", "Same, I\u2019m an introverted person but I still stayed at my brother\u2019s wedding till the end.
