She said it with such ease that I thought it was something easy (like getting her something to eat or whatever), well she asked me to see if I could take money out of my 401k (U.S. retirement plan). Here\u2019s some history:\n\nMy sister has three kids, 9m, 3f, and 7month old m. The father of the first two children was a drug addict and passed away from an OD. Honestly I understood my sisters grief, but was ultimately was relieved she didnt have him in her life. When this guy passed, her current \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d decided to swoop in while my sister was still grieving her partner, as she already had some emotional and mental damage from before the original relationship, I could see why she easily fell for this new guy. They lived together for a few months, she got pregnant, he decided to move to Mexico, \u201cto get clean\u201d. He then denied being the father of this child and ghosted my sister (with a lot more stories involved). Until recently that he got in to the picture again. \n\nBefore he got into the picture again, my sister decided to throw my niece and nephew a huge party that follow our Mexican traditions. Well these parties can cost a lot of money. On top of the party, she decided she is going down to Mexico to visit said man so that he can meet his son. Thus the reasoning she asked me to get money out of my 401k, as she knows I wouldn\u2019t have the amount she needs saved up. I told her I would think about it. \n\nShe has borrowed me a large sum of money in the past (college years, when I got in a ruff patch with my serving job), but I\u2019ve already paid her back. I have a decent paying job for my age and I\u2019ve never said no to borrowing anyone anything, including money. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a pushover either, so most people wouldn\u2019t think about asking me. But, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to take out any money from my 401k to borrow my sister for a party and indirectly, for her to visit this guy. AITA for saying no?", "created_utc": 1689723823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153eevy/aita_for_not_taking_money_out_of_my_401k_for_my/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not do it. There is a hefty tax penalty. It would be different if there was an emergency situation that maybe it would be more justifiable. This is not one of those times.", "NTA. . . 401k isnt a typical \"account\" and you personally can be charged heavy fees and taxes for withdrawal like that. . . If the guy really wanted to meet his kid he should be paying anyway. Your 401k shouldnt be used for your sister's vacation to see that deadbeat", "NTA.  It's not just the tax penalty people have already mentioned.\n\nBut, if she doesn't pay you back, you'll miss out on at least 40 years of that money growing exponentially.\n\nThat's why the earlier people are able to start on their retirement, the less they have to contribute to it on a monthly/yearly basis to meet their goals.", "NTA, do not give her money from your 401k. It's not like taking money out of the bank. You will be taking a loan against your 401k that you will have to pay back. I've done this once when I had an emergency and I paid the money back. But trust me if you don't have to don't do it. Also depending how your account is set up you may have a penalty. So just Don't. Her (your sister) wanting to throw a party and to go see some dude is not an emergency. She does not need it.", "If you have already paid her back don\u2019t give the money NTA", "NTA, it's a terrible idea, don't do it.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t do this. This is your retirement and you\u2019ll get penalized for taking that money out. Your sister made her bed so now she can lie in it. Her bad choices should not be your problem.", "NTA. It is a terrible idea to take money out of your 401k. \n\nAnd btw, to borrow is to take and to lend is to give. Your sister wants to BORROW money and you should not LEND your sister that money.", "NTA.\n\nSay you take $10K out of your account, you'll automatically pay federal and state taxes plus an additional 10% penalty.  So, if you loan her $5K, she will need to pay you back $10K for you to break even.  (Approx, of course)", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't withdraw or borrow any money from your retirement account until you're retired and need retirement income.  And certainly shouldn't withdraw any money for non necessities.\n\nIf you can afford to do so, you might offer to buy each of your sister's kids some clothes this fall and/or school supplies for the oldest.  That would be far better for the kids than a party their mom can't afford.", "Step Away From The 401K!\n\nIn no sense are YTA.  Retirement now solely rests on the shoulders of workers.  This means between between 25-30 we need to grow to saving at least 10% of income for retirement.  After 30 it is critical to increase this percentage in order to have security for a normal retirement. Unfortunately, far too few people earn a living wage to be able to make this a reality.\n\nSo few people are taught this - you certainly won't hear it from politicians or the government.  Once money goes into a retirement account - it stays, until retirement.  50 years from now this will be self-evident.  Just look at the reports on how few folks have funds available to retire.  Unfortunately, at 70 years of age it's too late to act.", "NTA. DO NOT DRAW FROM YOUR 401K. Tax penalty aside, lost interest will far out strip whatever sister pays back. Depending on your situation you may be able to take out a loan against the 401k as collateral. If your sister doesn't pay back though, it could ruin your credit AND wipe out your retirement. In addition, if you do this now where will she get money for her daughter's Quincenera?\n\nIf the purpose of the party is to show off wealth the guests will all know the true situation anyway. If it's to get the family together to celebrate the kids, paper plates, plastic cups and bbq/potluck may have to do.", "Suze Orman says NEVER TAKE MONEY OUT OF YOUR 401K", "Please say no. NTA.", "NTA. She wants the money to throw a party? Look your sister's life sounds like a mess right now, but you don't have to go above and beyond for her. If she needed some rent/food money then maybe, but this is ridiculous. Can't her \"fiance\" pay any of this?", "NTA.\n\nTaking out from a 401k is significantly more expensive than what you actually take out, so the matter is that added cost. Not to mention...for a party? Like, living expenses and such I get. This, though, is entirely unnecessary. Your sister doesn't sound like like makes smart decisions and funneling her money to keep that pattern going doesn't sound ideal.", "NTA. Ooh hell no, don\u2019t you dare touch that 401k for her or any other reason. This isn\u2019t even an emergency if she wants to take a trip then she can save up for it on her own. I highly doubt you\u2019ll get your money back either. She sounds terrible Lu entitled.", "Tell her that that money isn't available to you without incurring a huge penalty that would drive the cost of the loan too high for her to ever pay back. I mean, we all know that she's *never* going to pay the money back no matter what happens - with multiple kids and those bad life choices repayment just won't happen - but you can at least use the fact that she's now pretending that this isn't a gift as a reason to say no. NTA.", "NTA. You should have just said no.", "NTA and please learn this at 25: NEVER EVER TAKE MONEY OUT OF YOUR 401K UNLESS YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. A trip to Mexico or a party will cost you!!!!!", "NTA.  And her plan seems unwise.  Take a bunch of kids in the road to meet up with an addict who ran out on them.  If he wants to meet the kid he can travel.  Don\u2019t lend her money to do something so stupid.", "NTA. DO NOT do this.", "NTA.  I borrowed from my 401K once. Yikes. First, you incur a penalty for doing that. Then, when you pay it back, it's post-taxes, so you get hit again. And will you get that money from your sister? \n\nSometimes, a person had to deal with the consequences of their own bad decisions before they can start making good ones.", "NTA please don\u2019t do this. It would be a huge mistake", "NTA  \n\n\nI understand its cultural significance but at the end of the day, it's a party.  It would be a dumb move to give her any money for a party but a completely moronic one to take it from your 401k. You will have to pay taxes and penalties plus it's not like when she pays you back it can go right back into your 401k since that has to be a payroll deduction. It will be a big setback for your financial future.", "NTA.\n\nAlso your sister needs to get in touch with Social Security.  If the OD father worked enough, his minor children should qualify for Social Security benefits every month.", "NTA...do not lend her the money.  She sounds very irresponsible.", " Nope,  nope, nope, nope, not an option; your 401k is for your retirement, not her party piggy bank.  The International Bank of Sis is closed.", "OP, your sister is making really poor life choices. It is best not to lend support to any of these choices. \n\nIf anything you might want to consider saving up so you can afford to care for the kids once CPS is inevitably involved.", "DO NOT TAKE THE TAX PENALTY ON THIS!!\n\nNTA", "Nobody\u2019s the AH\n\nI think that you could explain to her the tax penalty and paperwork involved with taking it out of your retirement. Offer her a portion of the money if you have something saved up she could borrow. She has lent you money in the past so offering nothing seems like an AH. Maybe if she needs 5k and you can offer her 1-2k that would be better than nothing. Not sure if the exact financial requirements of this trip.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
