They are planning on a destination style wedding with around 50 guests to Florida. Sister is looking for a large beach house that can hold 14 of her closest family members for the week of their wedding. Among the houses she has found that are within walking distance to the beach and hold all of us will cost each person around $1,000. When going through the houses she was deciding on, she states that my boyfriend and I (both 25 years old) will have to share a room with either my grandmother or my two younger brothers (ages 16 and 6) because of the number of beds in the house. At first I was taken back by the price as both me and my boyfriend will have the pay the $1,000 plus sharing a room with someone else but after having a conversation with my sister and her fianc\u00e9, I felt like I had no other choice but to suck it up having to pay the costs as she expressed she would only be getting married once and our mother had already expressed it was a little pricey which annoyed her. (background info my boyfriend and I just bought a house a few months back) Now after speaking about costs with my boyfriend (as he was not there during the initial conversation) | am starting to worry about the cost of staying at the beach house. As I am the sister of the bride and maid of honor I will have additional cost such as nails, dress, spray tan, flights to florida, food for the week, bachelorette party, etc. I texted my sister saying that after thinking about all of these cost I am worried about the beach house and gave a suggestion that my boyfriend and I could rent an airbnb that we found 8minutes away from where they would be staying which would cost us $1,300 for the week to split ($650 each). This upset her greatly with my mom telling me she was crying that I didn't want to stay with them and my sister telling me that shes upset we went ahead and decided we would rather stay in a separate house than be together. She says everyone is making sacrifices and sharing rooms and she's been trying her best to keep everyone's best interest in mind when it comes to cost and space. She says that they will not be asking for the payment right away with a 50% deposit at the time of booking and then the rest 2 months prior to the vacation which can help with upfront costs. In all, I don't think she's understanding that her want of having us all under the same roof is not possible without being too costly and I don't see the issue with us getting our own place 8min from them to help cut costs. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of deciding to get a separate house with my boyfriend or \"sucking it up\" and spending the extra money for the beach house.\nSo, AlTA for not wanting to stay at my sisters beach house for her wedding?", "created_utc": 1704607446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190le4i/aita_for_not_wanting_to_stay_at_my_sisters_beach/", "score": 720, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact we need to spend less and us SLEEPING somewhere else is an issue is astounding. \n\nYes, it's your wedding, but I am not going to put myself in debt, nor will I put us on financial trouble to give in on where we sleep. You need to be more understanding when people can not afford such. \n\nSo, the options you have are either we rent the airnub and this is dropped with no tantrums, manipulation, and trying to make me look bad for not giving in on what is MY AND BF LIFE or I can just not attend.\n\nI love you, but your reactions about sacrifice are bull. Where are you sacrificing anything when we have to be the ones putting our financial responsibility in jeopardy to make you happy. So you choose because I refuse to do that to me, and my bf and MY FAMILY should understand that guess what life happens and family does mean it only goes one way. That being yours. Where are you as family supporting and understanding of me?\n\nSo I will give you a week to decide which you want to choose. \n\n\nThen, just not answer the phone to either mom or sister. If ANY other family calls or says you're being selfish. Then you have the answer you need, and at that point, I would mass text the entire family. \n\nSeems bride to be made her choice. No one, especially family, has any right to demand or shame or manipulate me into putting money. I DO NOT HAVE into what she wants. Other options were offered that were within what we could afford. I find the entitlement of family who wants me to give in because she is family but not willing to support me because it's ok I go into debt. That I possibly not be able to afford my mortgage or other bills astounding. You have shown your true feelings so I will be stepping back from family who has shown a demand to go into debt just to sleep is more important then me not being able to pays bills that they care so little. So remember family is supposed to support each other and by not supporting me you have shown I am nothing to you so enjoy having one less family member until to come to terms with the fact that the person in the wrong does not get supported while making the one harmed give in. \n\n\nI am sorry, hunny, but at this point, it is time to take a stand and be willing to limit contact. Be willing not to attend the wedding. Because everything I said to send is true. Family supports and understands. They do NOT do what they are doing. And if you let this go because you love family and don't want to lose them, that's your choice. But remember, you are also making that choice for your BF. You are making him either choose you or go into debt. And what is the next thing you have to give on. To pay what you don't have. To do when it costs you. At what point do you call people out on their behavior and put yourself and who you are with first?", "I can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so pricey.

I\u2019d expect a luxury villa complete with infinity pool and butler service for that, not to mention my own fuckin room. \n\nI\u2019ve always found that the more people book into a villa etc, the cheaper it is for everyone. Is she and fianc\u00e9e also staying there, and are they paying their share? More importantly maybe, if they are, are they sharing their bedroom with others as well?\n\nAnd tbh I can\u2019t imagine anything worse than going somewhere for several days and having to share a room with other people as well as my SO.\n\nTbh it sounds like it would be cheaper if everyone found their own airbnb and you all met up somewhere for meals etc. \n\nYou need to put your foot down firmly and tell her, you are booking your own place to stay as it\u2019s much cheaper and u won\u2019t have to share your bedroom. It\u2019s probably a good idea to suggest it to everyone else as well.

The per-adult cost of splitting this house is $167/night, which for a couple like OP would be $330 per night.  For an ocean-front place attached to the wedding venue, that's a steal - it's just outside of their budget.  I went to a FL beach wedding, and as a couple we spent twice that per night in a hotel.  \n\nNo one was the AH until sister started the fit / guilt trip about OP declining.

If the MOST important factor is having you all there then she needs to book a house with an adequate number of bedrooms, not a pool.", "Well at least she\u2019s not cheating you! That\u2019s a small silver lining. But I agree with the other commenters that the financial burden your sister is expecting everyone to take on is just too much. Her expectations are not reasonable and you are NTA if you find ways to mitigate the financial hit you are taking. \n\nHeck, the people I know who had destination weddings made it perfectly clear that they understood if people couldn\u2019t come due to finances. If they had people they absolutely needed there, they either outright paid or helped finance it.", "Agreed!", "excellent comment"]}
