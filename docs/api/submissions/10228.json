I completely understand doing whatever you can to save your wife, however it probably would have been better to talk to your ex wife and son about selling the car instead of just deciding you were going to take back a gift you gave your son that he depends on to get to work. \nYou should probably replace the car you took from him as soon as you are able and work on apologizing repeatedly for you how handled this.", "[deleted]", "INFO did you consider selling the car to his mom so he'd still have access to it?", "YTA big time\n\nI hope your wife gets better cancer sucks, but you, my friend, just changed your relationship with your teen son and not for the better.\n\nIf I was the son I would start distancing myself from you because you have chosen your relationship to build and which to destroy. I would also feel that you can not be trusted and your word means shit. But that's if it was me, maybe you have a wonderfully strong relationship with your son and you didn't get ruin your relationship.\n\nEdit to note that in the US most major health facilities offer \"Health Loan\" at 0% interest, because it's illegal to charge interest on a medical bill.

This car couldn't have been worth more than 5 grand and hospitals can't refuse treatment based on your ability to pay. You could have taken out a loan or gone into debt to finance the treatment.

How in the fuck is someone dying more important than a car. There's not always some magical way to make money out of thin air to pay for this treatment.", "I feel like I have entered the Twilight Zone with some of these responses. From what I gather, OP sold the hand-me-down car that his son was using (along with valuables he and his wife own) to potentially save his wife\u2019s life.

As far as \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you sell your own car?\u201d- are you all serious? The person who provides for the family and works and presumably carries the medical insurance should NOT be able to get to work? \n\nIt does suck that the son will have to rely on buses/rides to work for a bit, and that OP took the gift back. That said, children are not entitled to a free car, and if his mom is so upset she should give him a car. The son did not pay for this car out of his own pocket, OP did. \n\nI saw a comment that the son shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice because \u201cshe isn\u2019t even his family.\u201d Um, what?
