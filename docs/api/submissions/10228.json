Yeah, you all had to make sacrifices, but it seems like your son didn't get a choice in this. That is not a sacrifice on his behalf.

And how much did you get for it. Not more than a couple of grand for a 20 year old car.\n\nAs other comments mentioned, it seems like selling your son's car wasn't your only choice. Just the best choice for you. If it was the best choice for all, you would have discussed it with your son before you stole his car.\n\nAnd you did steal it.

The health system is fucked, I can understand the desperation, but you basically pawned a stolen item and you're wondering why your son won't talk to you.", "YTA for what many others have said. I think you've succeeded in giving your son plenty of fodder for therapy. I understand cancer sucks ass, and I'm sorry about your wife, but this was not the way to handle it. He didn't ask for you to marry this woman or be dragged into the situation by removing his mode of transportation. You could have traded in your other car or something like that.", "YTA. Sell your own belongings first. smh. There are options out there: payment plans for example. even the shitty for profit system here in the us has those. \n\nYou didn't even ask. Just stole from your son. how is this not the actions of an Asshole?", "YTA. That's not his biological mom and he is not obligated to fork over anything to her.

His son didn't pay dime one for that car. His dad did something nice, situation changed, and he needed to sell HIS(the op) car. The OP owned the car, had his name on the title. He allowed his son to use the car. The son can get a fucking job and buy a car on his own, put it in his name and never have this issue again", "OMG.  NTA.  Your wife's surgery was a super important emergency, worth sacrificing your son's car.  That was a tough sacrifice though (even if necessary).   I'd play it this way.    When your wife is out of the hospital, start saving to buy son a replacement car.", "YTA understandably so  and in the soft side but still an AH. From the way your post reads you gave your son this car not let him use it. If so even if it was legally still in your name the intent was the car was his.", "YTA - you married your wife, your son did not. You created a new family, your son had no choice in the matter. You took vows to provide, your son did not. You effectively made your wife your son\u2019s responsibility by selling his car when he has no obligation to care for her. I am sorry about your wife, I really am, but this was off base and out of line. Apologize to your son, get him another car, and for Christ\u2019s sake care for your wife under your own power.", "YTA, \n\nAs much as I get how you need the money it\u2019s a really disrespectful thing to do. How are you going to handle the next financial emergency, if that was the only way to get some cash?", "YTA. You say you gave your son your \u201cold\u201d car. Presumably you have a new one that you bought recently? Did you consider selling that? You probably could have sold it, gotten more money, and gotten a crappy little car to get around. But no, you kept your new car. Your son has every right to be pissed. You are selfish.", "YTA. Sorry OP but that car wasn\u2019t yours to sell, it was your son\u2019s. Not only did you take away a gift, you took away some of his freedom.\n\nOne of my friends has cancer and his health insurance paid a great deal of it. Where is you and your wife\u2019s health insurance? Why didn\u2019t y\u2019all consider taking out a loan or work out a payment plan with the hospital?", "YTA. You have given that car to your son already, so it wasn't yours to sell.", "YTA.\n\nUnless there were literrally no other options, including debt, taking away something that is both gift and means of transportation is an asshole thing to do.", "I swear I have read this one before. YTA. You don\u2019t give someone an item and expect it back when you need money.", "YTA. I completely understand doing whatever you can to save your wife, however it probably would have been better to talk to your ex wife and son about selling the car instead of just deciding you were going to take back a gift you gave your son that he depends on to get to work. \nYou should probably replace the car you took from him as soon as you are able and work on apologizing repeatedly for you how handled this.", "I need more context. What country do you live in? You say it was an emergency. Why do you think it was an emergency? Did you discuss it with your son before you made the decision? Did you speak with your wife beforehand? Your wife is unhappy with your decision. Who owns the title to the car? I kind of sound like a lawyer, but my point is that I have no clue. Desperate people do desperate things, and I can't figure out if you were desperate or not from your post. Also, cancer is hard. It's hard on the people closest to the cancer patient. I need more info to decide. I'd hate to call you an AH for no good reason. I empathize with you. My partner died of cancer and it was horrible.", "INFO did you consider selling the car to his mom so he'd still have access to it?", "YTA big time\n\nI hope your wife gets better cancer sucks, but you, my friend, just changed your relationship with your teen son and not for the better.\n\nIf I was the son I would start distancing myself from you because you have chosen your relationship to build and which to destroy. I would also feel that you can not be trusted and your word means shit. But that's if it was me, maybe you have a wonderfully strong relationship with your son and you didn't get ruin your relationship.\n\nEdit to note that in the US most major health facilities offer \"Health Loan\" at 0% interest, because it's illegal to charge interest on a medical bill. And they work with the families to pay large bills down, also there is gofundme accounts", "if u had other options yta but if that was the only way to do it no he is because its important to act quickly", "YTA. I am sorry about your wife and I hope she gets better. \n\nBut you gifted him the car. Therefore it\u2019s his. You don\u2019t get to sell his property. I would be angry as well.", "If it was literally that or she died, then nta I guess, but I have a hard time understanding why you couldn't sell your car or take out a loan.", "YTA - you're a thief. You stole from you're son as you mentioned that it was his car and you only forget to do the paperwork to transfer it to you're sons name.\n\nWhy you doesn't talk to you're son first and asked him? Or take out a loan? Make a payment plan?\n\nAnd you plan on paying you're son back, right? Because you owe him the amount you get for the car.", "I'm amazed you thought you even needed to ask. Of course YTA, you don't take a gift back. You just showed your son that your wife is more important so it's hardly surprising he doesn't want to spend any time with you. I doubt it will make a difference even if you manage to get a replacement car.", "NTA -  but you should have talked to your son first.\n\nThe people saying he should have sold his car - how old are you?", "YTA. This sucks, and I'm sorry, but it's really not on him to cover the costs of this", "YTA.  Have you spoken to a social worker or the oncologist\u2019s office regarding your financial difficulties?

However, your situation is one of the few situations I feel a take back is justified. Also, my answer is assuming all your other funding options were exhausted. For example, you have no savings, no credit cards and you weren't able to trade in your Truck for a honda civic to free up some money.", "I'm calling bullshit. This car couldn't have been worth more than 5 grand and hospitals can't refuse treatment based on your ability to pay. You could have taken out a loan or gone into debt to finance the treatment. It's not your son's fault that you are incredibly irresponsible with money. YTA for this post being fake or for you being one of the dumbest people on this planet.", "NTA. How in the fuck is someone dying more important than a car. There's not always some magical way to make money out of thin air to pay for this treatment.", "I feel like I have entered the Twilight Zone with some of these responses. From what I gather, OP sold the hand-me-down car that his son was using (along with valuables he and his wife own) to potentially save his wife\u2019s life. The only thing I think OP should have done was speak to his son about it first. \n\nAs far as loans/care credit- you have to have good credit to get approved for those. As far as \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you sell your own car?\u201d- are you all serious? The person who provides for the family and works and presumably carries the medical insurance should NOT be able to get to work? \n\nIt does suck that the son will have to rely on buses/rides to work for a bit, and that OP took the gift back. That said, children are not entitled to a free car, and if his mom is so upset she should give him a car. The son did not pay for this car out of his own pocket, OP did. \n\nI saw a comment that the son shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice because \u201cshe isn\u2019t even his family.\u201d Um, what? She is his stepmom, and has been in his life for 12 years. And since when is the convenience of a teenager having a car more important than a human life?
