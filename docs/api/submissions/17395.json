We normally don't bother paying for a pre-booked seat but this time it was included with our fare as we needed checked baggage, so we booked two aisle seats next to each other near the front of the plane. We both hate middle seats, and normally are fine being separated if it means each has a window or aisle seat, so this was perfect. While we were already seated and people were still boarding we were talking (not loudly, we were literally across the aisle, it was a normal volume), so it was obvious we were travelling together.\n\nThe man seating next to me in the middle seat (30s?) asked me politely if we wanted him exchanging seats with my friend, so we could be seated together, but I also politely declined, saying we'd booked it like that for a reason and we were already next to each other. After my answer he stopped being polite and insisted that people that travel together should be seated together, that we were being very rude to someone who only wanted to help us, and that we were disturbing other passengers with our \"loud talking\". We tried to ignore him but he kept on pestering us, and finally ended up admitting that he needed the aisle legroom more than us, since my friend and I are both pretty short and it wasn't fair that the man in the window seat was already eating into his space (to his credit that was true, the man in the window seat was a big guy). After that I had enough and told him we were not gonna move and he should suck it up, and then finally the safety briefing started and we were off. He didn't openly bother us again, but he spent the whole flight manspreading into my seat, but I didn't care because as I said I have short legs and the flight was barely two hours long. \n\nMy friend is obviously on my side, but my mother thinks we should have given in, since neither my friend nor I would've been bothered by the man in the window seat and we could have done a nice think for someone else who needed it.", "created_utc": 1684244438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j5k22/aita_for_not_exchanging_seats/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
