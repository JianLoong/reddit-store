Not only is she not rideable because of her size, she has cancer. Honestly I'm not sure how much longer she has and my place is more of a hospice. She's also lost weight because of it so now she's getting pampered while she lives out her life. She wants peppermints and apples after her meals? She can have a few bites.\n\nOccasionally I have a few neighbors with kids who come say hi to the horses. Usually not a problem since they typically keep an eye on the kids and I know them. Just can't go into the pastures. Few weeks ago we had a new family with young kids move in. I believe they're around 10 but unsure of exact age.\n\nThey came over and said hi, and they asked if they can also say hi to the horses so I said yes and explained it has to be over the fence, kids need to be supervised at all times, and they can't ride. For a while they were respectable of this or so I thought.\n\nMaybe a week ago I received a text from other neighbor that those new kids have been over without parents. I have cameras around the property but seldom check them, but sure enough, they were seen messing with the horses and trying to ride, especially the sick mare I mentioned earlier.\n\nI went over to their house and told them the kids were banned from the property unless they were supervised and I was also there then explained one of them is sick. Next day the kids (only the kids, no parents) rang the bell and asked if they could ride the horses. I said no and sent the kids back.

If this keeps happening, I'll be getting the law enforcement involved.\"\n\nI haven't seen the kids for a few days so I thought I got my point across. I was grocery shopping and I got an alert on my phone from my cameras. I changed the settings just to be on the safe side after I sent the text to the new neighbors.

The \"right\" to ride? Umm, has anybody explained that a horse is private property? You are definitely going to need to press charges if it happens again.", "Absolutely NTA. I grew up riding and working with horses, it can be dangerous to just interact with them if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and unsupervised kids messing around with horses will more than likely get hurt at some point. Miniature ponies are not exempt from kicking and biting and I\u2019ll bet you anything that if those kids has gotten hurt while messing with your horses while you weren\u2019t home the parents wouldn\u2019t think twice about trying to sue you. Not only that but one of your horses is sick and clearly deserves to live out her last days in peace, free from annoying, entitled little brats. You said nothing wrong, only the truth. \n\nStay firm on your threat to press charges, and given how entitled the parents are I would really make sure you keep an eye on them. There was a story a while ago where a kid was kicked out of his riding lessons because he kept running, screaming, and not listening to his instruction while around the horses. His dad started sneaking onto the property at night to hurt the horses in retaliation. Keep yourself and your horses safe OP! Don\u2019t think twice about calling the cops on them again!", "NTA. Those kids need to learn boundaries and respect for animals and other peoples property.", "NTA. Sounds like you have some entitled neighbors raising entitled kids. Good luck to you!", "NTA - no doubt if she kicks one of those kids, the asshole parents would be awfully quick to sue.\n\ngive the sick mini a scritch (assuming she's unusual, and not evil like most minis), and continue on guilt free.", "NTA I\u2019d have a group meeting with the other parents and kids tell them what is happening and that those kids are not allowed on property at all. The other families could help keep an eye out for the horses and trespassing kids.", "NTA. How many warnings do people need?\n\nThe father may throw a temper tantrum all he likes but that doesn't change the fact that it is your property, so your rules. IMO perfectly normal rules.\n\nYou and certainly your animals should not be the victim of parents not wanting to parent their children.", "NTA.\nHow sweet of you to give that horse a nice end. Watch your cameras, I don't think the parents are giving up. I hope the children stay away and that the horse has a nice last few months.", "NTA\n\nOther people do not have a right to your property. \n\nPresumably if those kids were hurt your would be liable?", "Nta, the kids do absolutely not have any right to ride the horses. Besides that, as someone who has no experience with horses, I would also say it's dangerous for kids to ride/be around horses unsupervised if they don't know how to treat the animals. Horses aren't toys, they have their own minds and I assume these kids don't know your horses very well. I'd say this is outright negligence from the parents especially if they continue to let their children do as they please.\nI hope these kids learnt their lesson and your sick mare (and the other horses) can get their peace.", "NTA - you told them multiple times not to do it. What did they think was going to happen?!", "NTA. Not at all. You handled that beautifully and your reply at the end was hilarious to boot.", "NTA.\nAt all.\nThose kids were trespassing and it seems the parents don't give a rats arse.\nThat dear old horse\ud83d\ude22\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "nta\n\nthe parents are also sick animals are the most dangerous \n\nthere in pain and can lash out\n\nthe parents are putting there kids at risk \n\na kick from a horse even a small one can be fatal", "NTA Your response was perfect. \n\n\"kids had every right to ride.\" \n\nReally? Who decided this right? Can dogs, cats, chickens be ridden?\n\nCan children ride horses anywhere in the world including prize race horses? \n\nIs there a limit to how many rides en enslaved horse must give to children. How about 1000 per day?", "As someone who owns a horse herself I can definetely say you are NTA. Playing around horses and trying to ride them is extremely dangerous. If the Kids actually managed to ride them the horses could have easily spooked and thrown them off and then you know the parents would try to rip into you because they are your horses. So telling them off with police help was definetely necessary", "NTA - wth did I just read? \"Every right to ride those horses\"? Except for the right of ownership, I would say lol sick=grumpy otherwise known as more likely to lash out. Is dad willing to accept that the horses have every right to kick their kids? I would be willing to bet the answer would be no and if the horse did kick one of them they'd sue for at least medical bills. You're smart to get the police involved, especially since they go on the property when you're not there. The grandpa comment is priceless. Thank you for providing a comfortable end of life experience for the mini, it takes special people to take animals they know are dying. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "What!? Hellz no, NTA. I'm surprised you needed to ask. You handled it like a pro.", "NTA.and DSL (Dead Set Legend). You're carrying for a sick horse. \nYou've made it clear to the people and children that it won't be appropriate to ride horses. \n\nThank you for caring for the horse.", "NTA.\n\nEntitlement runs strong in some people", "NTA.  They have a \"right to ride\"?!?  They trespass on your land and touch a sick animal that's big enough to kick them across the fence and they think they have the right?  What entitled jerks.  If they do it again press charges.", "Not only did you do the right thing by not letting strangers who are unfamiliar with taking care of horses freely stroll around on your property without conscent or warning, you even have them polite warning od the consquenses of their actions which they then promptly ignored. \n\nAnd I\u2019ll bet you a good deal of money that they would try to sue the hell out of you if one of yhe kids got hurt as a result of aggitating the horses. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
