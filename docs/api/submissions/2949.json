I grew up riding and working with horses, it can be dangerous to just interact with them if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and unsupervised kids messing around with horses will more than likely get hurt at some point. Miniature ponies are not exempt from kicking and biting and I\u2019ll bet you anything that if those kids has gotten hurt while messing with your horses while you weren\u2019t home the parents wouldn\u2019t think twice about trying to sue you. Not only that but one of your horses is sick and clearly deserves to live out her last days in peace, free from annoying, entitled little brats. You said nothing wrong, only the truth. \n\nStay firm on your threat to press charges, and given how entitled the parents are I would really make sure you keep an eye on them. There was a story a while ago where a kid was kicked out of his riding lessons because he kept running, screaming, and not listening to his instruction while around the horses.

And she is sick and old so she can't get away from them as easily.  \u2639\ufe0f Give her a Peppermint and a scrach from me.", "NTA. How in the world do they have the right to ride your horses? How do they have the right to anything or anyone on your property? Ugh.", "NTA.\n\nIn what world does that entitled asshole dad think the the kids have \u201cevery right to ride\u201d a horse that doesn\u2019t belong to them and have been told numerous times they are not allowed???  \n\nHonestly, I hope it happens again.  Press charges.  Fuck around and find out.  Bratty ass kids and asshole parents.", "NTA. For the kids\u2019 safety, even, this has to stop. My riding instructor was extremely safety conscious around horses, made one error, and got killed in her own barn.", "Most definitely not the asshole. They wouldn't be entitled to ride if the animal was healthy. But to harass an animal in the last weeks of life with cancer is animal abuse. Unfortunately where parents fail to parent, it often takes law enforcement to do so for them. NTA", "I'm not sure what went through their minds that gave them the impression that their little nightmares had the RIGHT to ride horses on YOUR property. Probably nothing but air.\n\nAnyway NTA.", "NTA. Ppl think their entitled to your animals is ridiculous.  What if one of the kids gets hurt? Than they'd probably try and sue you. Keep on top of them,  their idiots. And keep all your records of any correspondence.  You'll probably need it again. \n\nThe kids sound uncontrollable", "How in the hell do the kids \"have every right to ride\"??? These aren't their horses. That isn't their property. \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "nta\n\neven if the horse wasnt sick, they have no right to your animals", "Or dogs.", "No kidding. Learned in my farm safety class that the majority of animal related injuries/fatalities on farm are caused by horses.", "Seriously, it's a miracle the kids haven't been severely injured harassing them the way OP describes.", "If anything miniature horses and ponies are more aggressive with shorter tempers than their larger counterparts. In my experience anyway. Especially a sick horse who is likely on pain.", "I have 2 neighbors who are horse people (each set has over 10 horses each), so I help out when I can cause the neighbors are getting older. I was helping at the feed store when I heard this joke:\n\n\"You tell a gelding. You ask a stallion. You discuss it with a mare. But you pray like hell if it's a pony\".  \n\nNow, I like ponies. They got personality to say the least. But I am also 10000% with you that ponies are not exempt from causing injury. A sick one especially who may just decide fuck it and go for a bite or kick.", "Worst bite I ever got was from a Shetland pony named Flash Gordon.  Nailed me right on the side of my kneecap and caused some lasting damage I still deal with 25 years later.  Ponies are 1000% Satan.", "I feel like \"when it happens again\" is okay here. Entitlement like that almost guarantees it.", "Probably the same kind of people who think they have a right to their neighbour's yard and private pool because \"chiiiiildreeen\"", "Not just private property - a horse is a living breathing entity with a brain and free enough will to hurt someone who is hurting it.  I've never had cancer, but I've had gallbladder surgery, and I'd probably have bitten any kid that tried to make me give them a piggyback ride if they didn't listen to 1. a polite no, 2. a less polite no, and 3. a leave me alone you little shit before I bite you.", "I think the parents are the bigger problem here- they need to learn boundaries and respect for animals and other peoples property.", "Their parents need to learn too, but it sounds like the dad is shameless.  Hope those kids don't come around again and the dad will leave you alone.  \n\nIn a battle of wits, he's got less than half capacity to work with.", "\"They're out in a field just standing around.  That means they're free game.\"\n\nSure buddy, then that means *your car* that is sitting in the driveway is free game for me to \"borrow\" and take for a drive.  Your kids' bikes sitting in the yard are also free game.", "There was a case last year of a kid playing on the other side of a fence, and the horse jumped the fence and literally tore his arm off. Kid did not make it. \n\nOPs neighbors are negligent af for leaving their kids on their own while they mess with the horses.", "My GF's childhood friend hopped on the back of a hood horse (they ride them around the hood in Dallas, idk why), got bucked off instantly, and ended up with a metal plate in her arm.", "Would horses count as attractive nuisance?", "Especially tiny ones who can't carry the weight and sometimes have structural issues that make them even less able to deal with attempted rides.  It's animal abuse really.", "Or Jacks and Donkeys they\u2019re smart but stubborn but will fck you up", "Gross", "Oh man, ponies a chubby little devils. Cute as can be, but there\u2019s evil lurking below the surface. I have an off kilter coccyx to prove it", "The two miniature horses I know are not very aggressive and they are also not afraid of anything (including dogs, cars, people and much larger horses) so they are very easy to deal with even for me who is not very experienced with horses. A friend of mine goes running with them from time to time.\n\nAnd, yeah, the very idea of even kids riding them is crazy. They have a lot muscle but are still tiny.", "\u201cThe shorter the horse the closer to satan\u201d is my preferred pony explanation.", "\"Flash Gordon\" made me giggle", "I've been around horses my whole life and never seen anything like that. Something's wrong with that horse.", "Gonna need a source for that.", "You and the people around you didn't torment the horses is what happened - nothing wrong with an animal protecting themselves from assholes - they just don't have fingers and Reddit they have hooves and teeth", "Sorry, I misremembered the year. I think I probably just saw the article pop up last year and assumed it was recent.\n\n[Link](https://tulsaworld.com/archive/colcord-boy-4-dies-from-severe-horse-bites/article_ab2d9d90-1562-5399-8ec0-704eab018443.html)", "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mares_of_Diomedes\n\n/s", "Well it's possible that the kid who had it's arm ripped off isn't the one who taught the horse to hate people. Maybe it is the one, but some animals are just tight to be aggressive from past experience.", "Holy crap!  This may replace a chimp attack in my nightmares.", "Good God. I knew horses were dangerous but that never would have occurred to me.", "That is absolutely awful. Poor kid. Poor family.", "I saw a terrible video on here of a wild mustang killing a sheep, I imagine that little boy getting attacked looked pretty similar \ud83d\ude2c", "This made me stop regretting not having approached the last horse I saw.", "Saw one of a stallion killing a foal Infront of the foals mother. Mother couldn't do anything. Horses have an unbelievable power", "Why would a stallion kill a foal? I assumed stallions would protect the whole herd. Feeling like I'm about to learn a lot about horses that I didn't want to know.", "The foal wasn't his, the stallion killed it so the mare would go into heat again so he could impregnate her. In a herd there are usually only 1-5 stallions, the herd is lead by a mare."]}
