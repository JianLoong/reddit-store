He has never done anything malicious or nasty and is a nice enough guy. \n\nThe dog is also lovely but it is not trained at all, it doesn\u2019t listen to anyone\u2019s calls or do as you ask it to. It\u2019s only a semi small dog only slightly larger than a regular sized cat. \n\nA month or so ago my car was parked out front and as I was about to get in, neighbour was walking past with said dog and it wasn\u2019t on the leash. \n\nAs I opened my car door the dog ran up to me and jumped in my car jumping all over the seats and on the dashboard. \n\nNeighbour and I laughed it off but I was slightly frustrated there wasn\u2019t more urgency on his part to remove his dog from inside my vehicle. \n\nAnother time whilst standing at the front door, he walked past and the dog ran up to me and ran into the house before I shouted loud and it darted out. The reason I shouted was because at least 1 or 2 of my cats are always inside and that is their home, so I was slightly concerned for them. \n\nAnyways, breaking point came when I was taking out the bins and the dog again came running over, this time i dropped the bin bags and sprinted to the door to close it before the dog ran through my house again. \n\nNeighbour was laughing at the front fence but he immediately stopped when he saw my face and I told him sternly \u201cyou need to take control of this dog, come and collect it immediately.\u201d\n\nHe was clearly taken aback. His jaw dropped and I reminded him of the previous 2 incidents and that I have cats inside. \n\nMy wife was watching from the kitchen and said i was rude to him and that i should be more respectful to neighbours. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve done nothing wrong so I refuse to apologise to the neighbour as my wife wishes. \n\nAITA for my behaviour?\n\nEdit: spelling mistakes", "created_utc": 1674229033, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gzz54/aita_for_demanding_my_neighbour_collect_his_dog/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And no you should not have been more respectful, this dude is being extremely disrespectful to you and apparently has zero self awareness. If my dog got off leash and jumped in someone's car I would be mortified, someone's house I would consider moving away to avoid ever having to face that person again lol. This guy needs to keep his dog on a leash. That's a pretty universal rule unless you're in a dog park or somewhere designated as an off leash area. It doesn't matter if the dog is friendly, clearly the dog isn't under his control since it keeps running off and going into people's cars and houses.", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\nI hate it when people can't be bothered to leash their pets or fence their yards; that poor doggo is going to end up hit or get in the wrong person's/animals face at the wrong time.\n\nBest you can do is take action on your end to protect your cats and property.", "NTA. Once is an accident. Twice, is careless. Three times is lazy, arrogant, irresponsible and reckless. This is an accident waiting to happen. Untrained dogs, whilst often friendly, have no boundaries and no self control. If it\u2019s got prey drive, it could see your cats and chase them, potentially attacking them, or chasing into traffic or hell even just traumatising them in a home which is their safe space. \n\nIt\u2019s against the law in many places to have an out of control and/or unleashed dog. Make it clear that you will report him to animal control unless he gets his dog under control.", "NTA.  Three strikes, and the dog is out, on its way to the Speed-E-Kill Shelter and Incinerator Company.", "Thanks everyone. \n\nThe main consensus here is that I\u2019m NTA - however, next time if I\u2019m ever in a similar situation I will be sure to set boundaries the moment a dog jumps into my car uninvited!", "*Respect is earned, not given* would have been my retort; neighbor isn't even walking his dog on a lead.", "Definitely,  I can't imagine there's no leash law in ops area.", "Not to be rude, but what does that have to do with OP's interaction with the neighbour?", "Me too, like immediately when the dog jumped in my car.", "Boooo you don't get to ask for tax after victim blaming. Anyone with a shred of interpersonal intelligence will realize that people don't love untrained dogs running wild", "Exactly. Dog owner sucks for not controlling his animal, OP sucks for allowing him to think it was OK, on multiple occasions, before arbitrarily escalating to an immediate confrontation.\n\nIf OP had communicated calmly in the first place such an encounter could have been avoided.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it, describing the guy as \"borderline alcoholic\" despite it having no relevance to the events in question seems like OP is trying to bias user responses to save face.

NTA.", "A precedence is set the first few times that OP didn't communicate their dissatisfaction. Although the Dog Owner holds responsibility for the dogs actions, if something is perceived to be ok, it would come across as confusing for someone to suddenly become confrontational. Therefore, it's also OPs responsibility on that first occasion to just say, \"I'm not ok about that happening. Would you mind keeping the dog on a leash?\"\n\nAt the end of the day, no one was harmed and all animals were safe. It's not a big deal, it's just an area where a bit more communication could have helped the situation. OP asked for feedback, I've given it.", "I said borderline alcohol being nice to be honest, the guy is a full blown alcoholic. \n\nOther neighbours on the block who he frequents regularly have confirmed this. \n\nI would like to counter that I wasn\u2019t being completely biased as I also mentioned he has never caused any trouble and he is a nice enough guy. \n\nI think the main consensus here is that I\u2019m NTA as the dog is his responsibility. \n\nI am however going to take on board that I should have set boundaries with him the moment the dog jumped into my car. I think this would\u2019ve meant my stern response being much more warranted and likely have avoided the 2nd and 3rd interactions altogether.", "Not relevant as the neighbour doesn't bring it up in the encounter", "He literally shouted the second time.

They need to either train their dog, or have it trained, and unti it is trained, they need to do all they can to make sure their dog doesn't go into your car or house.There is this thing called a \"leash.\" They need to get one, and use it.

They're non-native predators that actively harm local bird populations and they're allowed to go unsupervised on other people's property (I'm allergic and used to have a neighbor's cat regularly making a home on my outdoor furniture and terrorizing my leashed dog) with no regard for how it may affect your neighbors.", "NTA.\n\nYou're way more patient than many people would have been. I'm a huge dog person, but that doesn't make it ok for other people to not train their pets properly and let them disrespect your property that way.\n\nPresumably you don't allow your cats to act that way, because if they're similarly in his yard all the time then you both suck :)", "NTA\n\nNeighbors is.

But you are a super asshole for letting your cats out into the neighborhood. You are a bad pet owner", "NTA but also....you have animals that are out and about not being supervised.
