I\u2019m not wealthy but I make enough to very comfortably support myself. I work from home & have a flexible schedule so I have a lot of time to live how I want. \n\nI have a complicated friendship with Emma (27F) because I love her but she frustrates me. Emma is a single mom with 2 children, Caleb (7M) & Grace (4F). Grace has had serious lung problems since birth & contracted RSV in Oct & has been hospitalized since. It\u2019s been a horrible time & she is finally more stable now but not well.\n\nEarly into grace\u2019s hospitalization, Emma asked me to take Caleb. Emma lives with her parents who were not willing to watch him full time so I happily took him in & temporarily converted my den into a room for him. He\u2019s a sweet kid who\u2019s been though a lot & I\u2019m happy to give him some quiet space. \n\nI\u2019ve never taken care of a child long term before & my life was not set up for kids but he has adjusted well. I love cooking and collecting special ingredients to use and try in new recipes & Caleb just rolled with it. I grow micro greens at home and he\u2019s loved watching the process & incorporating them into his food. He hasn\u2019t liked everything but he\u2019s always willing to try. \n\nI like pour painting & we\u2019ve been having craft nights where he gets to experiment with his own canvases which he\u2019s enjoyed. We also take trips to museums & shows. I\u2019ve kept up my regular life & luckily, he was thrilled to come along. I would\u2019ve struggled to come up with a more kid specific lifestyle. \n\nEmma usually only calls weekly & sees him maybe once or twice a month which bothers me but the Grace situation must be draining so I try not to hold against her but it does mean that Emma really has no idea what we do day to day. \n\nYesterday was Christmas & he was going home to visit his mom. I sent him with his gifts (shoes & books) plus gifts for his mom & sister. \n\nHis grandma dropped him off last night & didn\u2019t really say much to me which was weird. Caleb looked sad & didn\u2019t want to talk about it so I let it be & we watched a movie before bed.\n\nLate that night, I got a call from Emma scream crying at me for ruining her relationship with her son. I guess it didn\u2019t go super well & she feels that Caleb is now spoiled because of me and that what she can provide is no longer good enough for him. \n\nHe wants to make kimchi with her. He wants to get a cat. He didn\u2019t want the mac & cheese his mom made for him. When Emma gave him a new coloring book, he told her about the paintings instead and asked her to get the supplies so they could do it together when he went back home. He asked why she never takes him to museums.\n\nI was so thrown off by the screaming that I yelled back & told her I wasn\u2019t going to downgrade my life to suit her expectations & she hung up on me.\n\nI feel guilty now. I really hadn\u2019t considered how I could be affecting Caleb\u2019s tastes long term but I think she should\u2019ve thought about that herself.

The kid is 7! She only saw him a couple times a month. She abandoned the poor thing. How far apart are y'all that she wasn't seeing her son?", "NTA, yo, hook that kid up with some culture, shit. Maybe explain auntie and mama don't roll the same way? You're dope as fuck for taking him in.", "NTA \n\nThis actually made me laugh\u2026she\u2019s so furious about the way your raising her child, yet she dumped him straight back to you at the end of the day?! That\u2019s a whole new level of entitlement \ud83d\ude44 she should be more grateful that you have been caring for her child for so long with what I am interpreting as zero financial compensation.", "NTA. Wow! You are a hero for taking on the added responsibility of a child for long stretches of time, and I'm  assuming you are paying for the extra food. Etc. I'm a bit surprised that the family didn't step up, however I don't know the situation- they may be ill or something. \n\nYou have been a wonderful friend to them, and it's a shame they can't see it. Not many people would have taken on this responsibility. In the process you have opened the child's mind to new things such as museums, which is also great and a broadening experience for the child.\n\nIf your friend is mad, they can always find somewhere else for the child to stay, and if the friend's bad behavior persists, you might insist on it. The person seems very ungrateful.for what you have done.", "I'm gonna say NTA. You took on a child when you didn't have to. \n\nYour friend's family didn't step up to the plate. Your friend visits her child so rarely, she's at risk of becoming \"auntie mom\".\n\nYou shouldn't have to give up your life for a kid you didn't ask for, but happily took on.", "NTA - she's upset because she's jealous that he actually loves spending time with you but she shouldn't have got mad with you, because you're doing her an enormous favour by becoming his primary caregiver. And you probably shouldn't have yelled back, but it's emotional for you both so it's understandable.\n\nThis was always going to be difficult and I think you both need to talk it through - it seems to have surprised you both - but he was always going to bond with you and gain a bit of independence from her. There may be some things you can both do that will make this a bit easier on you all - he takes some of his preferred art materials when he sees her so he can show her and she can feel involved, she finds something 'special' that you and he don't do, to do one-on-one with him when she sees him etc. \n\nSuggest you sort this out and most importantly sit him down and tell him he's done nothing wrong, you both love him, and then keep talking so you can iron out any upsets before he is impacted by them", "NTA- She is an absentee parent to Caleb and it was put on display and she is now very embarrassed about it. Her daughter may be sick but only seeing and talking to your son a couple times a week!? She could easily call him every night to talk. None of this is your fault. You helped her out and took care of this child and eased him into your lifestyle to his benefit and yours. She just needed to call and have conversation with you about the exciting activities you have introduced Caleb to and she should be thanking you everyday for the help your giving her", "NTA.  This is about her not knowing her son anymore.  You're not spoiling him by cooking, doing crafts, and visiting museums.  They are things he's interested in and he's wondering why his mom doesn't spend time with him or want to learn about his new interests.  Having a kid in the hospital is horribly difficult, so I sympathize with her there, but she needs to make an effort to be there for her son too.", "NTA \n\nYou did her a HUGE favor by taking her son in when her family didn\u2019t want to. You have no reason to feel guilty. She\u2019s being ungrateful because you didn\u2019t have to take her son in. She chooses to only see her son once a month then wonders why he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her. I mean she can\u2019t even take him to see his sister.", "NTA you just opened up his world \ud83c\udf0e.", "You\u2019re certainly NTA what a kindness you\u2019re doing for your friend and for her son. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for him to not be seeing or hearing from his family.", "NTA NTA NTA!! You are an amazing person for loving on this boy. Mom needs to realize that you can't uproot a 7 year old child and expect everything to be hunky dory when you see him again. Personally I wouldn't be able to cope going that long without seeing any of my young children, but if I had no choice I would be so grateful to have someone like you to entrust them too.", "NAH. Your friend is having a hard time now because of her daughter's health situation, but she may never be in a position to do all the stuff with Caleb that you have been doing. Caleb will understand, in time, that she is his mother, and that the relationship you have with him is wonderful, but not that of a mother and son. In no way will I suggest to you that you lower your standards for how you treat Caleb or the activities he and you have together. In time, his mother will be grateful that you are taking so good care of her son and doing so much to make him miss her as little as possible. If that doesn't happen, then she is a ginormous AH, but let us give her the benefit of the doubt for now.", "NAH you are a hero for taking such great care of her son  when she is in a very difficult situation with her other child. Hopefully she will eventually see that and be grateful. She probably feels both guilty and jealous thst he\u2019s having such great experiences with you when she is unable to provide this level of care herself.", "NAH. I think your friend is just going through I hard time. I'd never be able to keep my emotions in check throughout that. Some of those things might have been hurtful, but she didn't really mean it. It must also be hard to see that there's a possibility her son is better off with someone else. Even if it's just a fleeting thought, that would be devastating to compare the two lives her son has when you look at it on surface level.", "NTA she has taken huge advantage of your friendship and you have performed beautifully as a caretaker for this boy. Honestly this sounds like a lifetime movie plot in some aspects. Hopefully it has a happy ending and mom learns that she has to actively reconnect with her son to make things right, and appreciates you instead of resents you.", "NTA, possibly (depending on how she follows up on this, what triggered the initial reaction, etc.) NAH.\nIt's understandable that she feels shitty about not being able to provide her kid with a lot of things he likes now. But it doesn't sound like you \"turned him against her\" in the sense of talking badly about the life with his mom. I hope for everyone's sake that together, you find a way to make Caleb understand why perhaps certain things are easier for you to provide, and to make the time he spends with you feel like a happy addition instead of a \"better\" or \"different\" version of what he doesn't have at his mom's.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like her family is unsupportive and she's not able to do a great job balancing the needs of her kids right now. If your ward is in a good school district, maybe reach out to the guidance counselors and see what support he might get through them for the abandonment he must feel.

I'm seeing things a different way but I could be wrong. Aside from you, she doesn't have a support system at all, not even from her parents. They're hell bent on kicking her out and her 2 kids. She's more than likely really struggling being away from one child and watching another one in the hospital in critical condition. She's struggling with juggling all of that. She isn't necessarily a negligent parent, she's unable to multitask. She lost the father of the children too just last year, so I can't imagine how overwhelming it must all be to be a single parent all of a sudden. I don't know, but it sounds like she's burned out and running on fumes all this point and not being able to give her attention.\n\nOP, maybe tone down the expensive hobbies a bit and maybe help him bond with his mother more, find out her hobbies and continue to talk about her and talk to her. She has every right to feel threatened because honestly, it looks like she's losing everything. The guy, the support, the child in the hospital, and now even the bond with her other child. Her anger may be misplaced but gosh, I really think she needs help. If she's unable to make it, maybe meet half way or take him to see his mom. Reestablish their connection.

They're less likely to forget people. He would still probably trade all of it to be with his family.", "It is if there's no one to watch the one in hospital. Dad doesn't seem around otherwise the parents would have a kid each and swap. Grandparents are useless. You can't leave a 4yo alone in hospital for more than the time it takes for a quick shower when they're asleep. Hospital staff make kids better they don't supervise or do personal care. A kid older than a baby in hospital can't be left alone for a few hours.", "Asking OP to tone down her LIFE in her own HOME is ridiculous.

Meanwhile, mom and the 6F are really sick, and the 2M's got the sniffles but that's not slowing him down any! Hubby stepped in to help the first night, so that Dad could get some sleep (in the ICU room) while helping monitor the 4F and keep her calm. Next night while hubby's checking in, 6F needs to get to the ER, and they have one car. So hubby takes their car (we don't have kid seats), picks me, and drops me off to babysit 2M and gets mom and 6F to the ER. Then spends night two in the ICU while the parents are downstairs in the ER. The family finally steps in on day three and offers meaningful support. (Kids are now all home and recovering.)\n\nMy point with this is that having a 4 year old in the hospital is draining on its own. They can't advocate for themselves, have little emotional regulation on the best days, and are still working on communication. You don't get more than 20 min or 30 minutes at a time, and all around you are more very sick children. It's fucking awful. And Emma has the support of one person.\n\nOP, Emma is stressed to the breaking point. The people she should be counting on are either dead or not stepping up. I can only imagine what's going through her head, but none of it is likely positive. And you are the safest person to unleash on, as you aren't going to kick her out, you clearly aren't going to abandon Caleb, and you can't negatively affect Grace's care.\n\nYou're doing great. You're giving Caleb a safe and loving environment when a lot of other people can't or won't. You have nothing to feel guilty for. Maybe find some time to visit Emma and Grace with Caleb. Do a little more heavy lifting, and forgive your friend for being on the brink of a breakdown. She's got really good reasons for that.", "NTA. You are exposing him to amazing things.", "NAH I can see why the mom is upset you show him things that well she can't she doesn't have the money for any of that, as she is trying to care for his sick sister, but you didn't do anything wrong you were just living your life but maybe try to get him to be more understanding that his mom can't do those things as you can but his mom does still love him", "NTA but maybe start emphasizing to him the importance of saying thank you when someone gives you something", "ESH your friend is going through a very rough time right now. You kinda set her up to fail by showing Caleb a life where a person who can spend all their free time on a kid (because they have the money and aren't already burnt out by a kid). It would be different if it was like a one night thing where it is one day of fun and then back to normal but you made this expensive and time consuming lifestyle his normal and what did you expect your friend to do? What did you expect Caleb to do?

She doesn\u2019t answer when we call. I know she\u2019s depressed but I don\u2019t even know where to begin. \n\nI do want to clarify one thing here, just because I\u2019ve seen a few comments on it  - Emma was a single mom long before her ex died. He went off the rails and pretty much abandoned them when Grace was 6 months old. He\u2019d occasionally show up to steal from, terrorize and/or dote on his kids, depending on what stage of his addiction he was cycling through but he wasn\u2019t a consistent presence for years before his death. His parents are a very sporadic presence, they were the ones who stayed with Grace on Christmas but I think that\u2019s the only time they\u2019ve seen her in the hospital. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that makes it easier emotionally - if anything, it only further complicates the grieving process. But it\u2019s probably worth noting.", "I do not. His school and his pediatrician both know he\u2019s in my care but I have nothing official beyond that. \n\nA lawyer is a smart move but I don\u2019t want to do anything that will make her feel like I\u2019m trying to actually steal her child.", "Why?

You never chose to have this kid. Yet you're generously dedicating your time (as well as love and money) to him. Mom should be grateful that he's getting all of these experiences which clearly seem out of range for him if she were the one taking care of him. She did the right thing making sure he was taken care of and it seems she did well raising him (if there aren't too many tantrums and he's adapted well to all the changes) before. She really has let the ball drop by not checking in on him more often, but that has nothing to do with him preferring the meals and activities he's become accustomed to. Honestly, it's unfair and heartbreaking for mom, but that's life sometimes. Mom should appreciate OP raising him so well while she can't.", "NTA. From what you've said, you've shared your life with Caleb and offered him new experiences, not actively tried to alienate him from his mother. \n\nI can see why Emma might react badly, not because you've done anything wrong but because she feels stressed and alienated from her elder child. She's a single mother, one child seriously ill and in hospital some distance away, she's not seen much of her other child for months and she's realised what she's missed. Unfortunately, Emma's limited contact has meant this change in/development of her son's tastes, interests and wishes have meant its effectively blindsided her on the Christmas visit. Not to mention the financial drain Grace being in hospital, travelling to the hospital to speak time with Grace, and I am guessing loss of income.  \n\nI would suggest if it is not going to upset things too much, ask Emma if she can fit in more regular chats with her son, if not more regular visits. Whether she says she can or can't, consider sending video updates of what you have Caleb have done together, and particularly Caleb 'showing' his mom and sister his work or what he's learnt - not to rub Emma's nose it in, but so she keeps up to date with her son's life.\n\nWhen Caleb does go home, could you perhaps gift him/them a family ticket for local museums - so Emma can take both her children (when Grace is well enough), and so Caleb's interests can both be continued and shared??

You also made sure he wasnt lonely, or made to feel like a burden on you.\n\nI think she ought to go over her entire interaction with Caleb because he asked HER to make kimchi with him, he asked HER to paint with him, he asked HER if they could go to museums.

Her behaviour as described by OP is not a committed mum going through a tough time, it's abandonment. She has neglected him in every single way, he feels she doesn't want or love him, and no matter whether she is able to get things together and care for him again as Gracie recovers, the memory of her making him feel unloved and unwanted at Christmas will probably stick with him for the rest of his life. \n\nYou're right that she's going through hell.

We do know the mom is dealing with extraordinary stress, fear, and probably grief. \n\nMy baby had rsv... Mild compared to current strain. It was terrifying. A child dealing with long term life threatening illness is going to take an enormous toll. I would not expect 100% perfect behavior from a parent. I might expect irrational, emotional responses at times. It's also the first Christmas without her husband. Just awful. \n\nI am not going to assume a mother in that situation is an AH.

The grocery like the rest of us i presume.\n\nDid she not need to clean up the mac and cheese either.\n\nI know kraft mac and cheese is the American instant noodle or something. But even the instant ready to go mac and cheese I've had requires *some* prep. Which is probably comparable to it\n\nThe entire point I assume is to spend Christmas with her son who she doesn't see.

Is complaining that you are spoiling him by spending time with him and he appears to be interested in doing the things with you?  And if you are that bad for the child, why bring him back over to you?\n\nWhile I am not an expert in child care, but I can tell you that from the way he is acting, he is being neglected and given the bare minimum at home and not alot of interaction with any adult.  Nothing there that is positive, nothing that says hey how about you and me go and do something, more like you are here, just go play in your room by yourself.  And he is clinging to you cause probably are the first actual adult who has included him in activities and opened up his eyes to a whole new world.  \n\nWhile she may not have to change her lifestyle but would it kill her or her parents to actually spend time with him?  From what you have described, he sounds like a wonderful little boy who is in desperate need of attention from an adult who is going to hold his hand and say:  It is ok for you to be you and explore.

I have two kids, and for a while, children\u2019s services put my teenaged niece with me too. It was a pretty big upgrade for my niece. She was suddenly getting allowance for doing chores because my kids got allowance for doing theirs. She was allowed to request specific items for school lunches, instead of whatever the food bank provided. We purchased some items for her room to help it feel more like home. When we got take out twice a week (one breakfast run on sports mornings, and pizza nights), she got it too. She got rides to friends houses instead of being made to walk, just like my kids. \n\nHer mother used to call me screaming because I was \u201cbuying her love\u201d and \u201cteaching her daughter to expect things she can\u2019t provide.\u201d \n\nThe reality is, we weren\u2019t spending our family\u2019s income on meth and booze and tattoos, and so we could afford to do these things for our children, and that included our niece as soon as she entered our care. We couldn\u2019t have 3 children under our roof and treat them all differently. We couldn\u2019t have different disciplinary rules. Houses don\u2019t work that way. \n\nYour friend can\u2019t expect you to take her child in and downgrade your life to accommodate the type of childcare she was providing.

She probably wanted a day where she was reunited with her child, who was ecstatic to see her, and instead got a child who seemingly rejected the things she offered. In reality, it sounds like he really enjoys some of your activities and was excited to share them with his mom, but she didn't take it that way. I think you should wait a little for Emma to calm down and then ask her over to talk it out. If she needs to vent about hospital stuff or other life stuff, hear her out. If she still acts horribly, it may be time for her to find another place for her son.", "NTA - this is a difficult situation for everyone.

She can't abandon her son and expect nothing to happen. And he doesn't hate her. He wants to share his new interests with her", "Look here. After all that, she still sent him right back to you.

After my mom died, many years later, I saw a copy of a letter she sent to me while I was there. They were in the same state, maybe an hour or two away, but that was it. Just a few letters and maybe the odd phone call. I enjoyed it where I was, but was also ok going back.

It\u2019s hard for her because she doesn\u2019t want to have a bad relationship with her son while going through all this and needing to look after her daughter while her parents are minimally helpful. She\u2019s in a tough spot and the OP is doing a tremendous service for her friend and the boy. A little further would be to talk about it with the son, try to explain what his mom and sister are going through, reassure him of his mother\u2019s love, and try to help help learn patience and be an outlet for him to talk about his feelings.

Most museums offer free entries to children, cooking different things is a way to bond and experiment and painting is a relatively inexpensive hobby. In your attempt to show grace to the mother, you seem to ignore that OP isn\u2019t being remotely extravagant. Her hobbies is her way of life that she allowed space for this child to experiment with.

How weird that the mother is not happy for her child, that he is having a good time and learning new things.", "Poor baby. All he wants is to spend time with her. That\u2019s what all of those activities are - quality time with someone you love. You are so NTA for providing him with one on one attention.

She's extremely lucky to have a wonderful friend who could step in, but this woman has got to be completely fried both physically and emotionally.\n\nHer small child is far away from her, and I'm sure she would see him more if she could but she has an even smaller, extremely ill child to take care of and she can't move the hospital closer to home.\n\nHer reaction was really bad, but can we have a little empathy for how she probably already feels like a terrible parent for what she's had to do, and the first time she gets to spend some time with her son again, nothing she does is good enough anymore. Nothing OP did was wrong, but surely you can understand how her friend must feel?\n\nShe doesn't have the luxury of sitting around thinking about her own situation from behind a keyboard, she's living it. I'm sure there's a better solution here but like, can we give her some grace?", "OP is trying to take care and distract a kid with a sister in critical condition o.o in this situation the other kid is often neglected and forgotten and OP helps for it to not be the case and you come here to say this sort of things ?????

I saw my mother about an hour a day. Hospital staff took care of me. The needs of a very sick kid are similar to the needs of a very sick adult\u2014hygiene, nutrition, hydration, medication. Nurses do all that. \"Supervision\" of a very sick child is mostly medical, they aren't running around causing mischief.\n\nMy earliest full memory is having a chat with an orderly about whether he could help me find cartoons on the TV. (And please don't argue with that, some people retain early memories, I've validated my details are correct with people who were present adults at the time.)\n\nThe mother is choosing, instead of spending, say, 95% of her time with sick child and 5% with well child, to spend 99.05% of time with sick child and .05% of time with well child. That is not because the sick child need her mother with her 24/7 to be ok. It is because the mother has some kind of worry, fear, irrational calculation, that is causing her to put everything daughter above anything son.

Maybe if she had made more effort to see her own son than \"once a week calls\" and once a month visits,  it would have mattered more.\n\nIt's not your fault if Emma can't maintain the standards you live by.  From what you posted, it's not solely a money thing.  Going to a museum is free.  \n\nMaybe this will be a wake-up call to Emma to work harder on what she can provide to her son.", "NTA, but cut her some slack. Long term hospitalizations work some serious damage on the mental health on both the patient and main caregiver.\n\nShe may be really stressed about money, disability, and yes, even temporarily surrendering the custody of her son.

He wants to make kimchi with the mom. He wants to buy painting supplies to do the pour painting with the mom. He asked the mom why they haven\u2019t gone to museums together. Which sounds to me like he wants to go with her. \n\nSo basically she\u2019s mad Caleb was introduced to new activities that she\u2019s not interested in? And it would have been easier for her if he only wanted to do the same stuff he\u2019d been interested in before she dumped him on her friend? \n\nSomeday Emma is going to end up on r/JUSTNOMIL as the MIL hating on her DIL for stealing her son and introducing him to new interests. I mean, obviously it sucks she feels like there is a disconnect between herself and young son, but that\u2019s more to do with the length of time she is leaving him IMO. It really does sound like she just doesn\u2019t want to do the things he\u2019s asking to do with her now. And art museums are free for the most part. What\u2019s to complain about there?", "While I agree with everything you are saying,  Caleb is the one in the middle.

And I don't think that is OP's goal. So, sadly, it falls on OP to do what she can.\n\nIf Emma won't talk to her, she should let Caleb text her once a day. If she doesn't respond, OP should reach out to the grandparents and ask them to ask their daughter to talk to her son every day. \n\nLook, I would love to just say screw Emma.
