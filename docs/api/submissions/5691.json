I\u2019m not wealthy but I make enough to very comfortably support myself. I work from home & have a flexible schedule so I have a lot of time to live how I want. \n\nI have a complicated friendship with Emma (27F) because I love her but she frustrates me. Emma is a single mom with 2 children, Caleb (7M) & Grace (4F). Grace has had serious lung problems since birth & contracted RSV in Oct & has been hospitalized since. It\u2019s been a horrible time & she is finally more stable now but not well.\n\nEarly into grace\u2019s hospitalization, Emma asked me to take Caleb. Emma lives with her parents who were not willing to watch him full time so I happily took him in & temporarily converted my den into a room for him. He\u2019s a sweet kid who\u2019s been though a lot & I\u2019m happy to give him some quiet space. \n\nI\u2019ve never taken care of a child long term before & my life was not set up for kids but he has adjusted well. I love cooking and collecting special ingredients to use and try in new recipes & Caleb just rolled with it. I grow micro greens at home and he\u2019s loved watching the process & incorporating them into his food. He hasn\u2019t liked everything but he\u2019s always willing to try. \n\nI like pour painting & we\u2019ve been having craft nights where he gets to experiment with his own canvases which he\u2019s enjoyed. We also take trips to museums & shows. I\u2019ve kept up my regular life & luckily, he was thrilled to come along. I would\u2019ve struggled to come up with a more kid specific lifestyle. \n\nEmma usually only calls weekly & sees him maybe once or twice a month which bothers me but the Grace situation must be draining so I try not to hold against her but it does mean that Emma really has no idea what we do day to day. \n\nYesterday was Christmas & he was going home to visit his mom. I sent him with his gifts (shoes & books) plus gifts for his mom & sister. \n\nHis grandma dropped him off last night & didn\u2019t really say much to me which was weird. Caleb looked sad & didn\u2019t want to talk about it so I let it be & we watched a movie before bed.\n\nLate that night, I got a call from Emma scream crying at me for ruining her relationship with her son. I guess it didn\u2019t go super well & she feels that Caleb is now spoiled because of me and that what she can provide is no longer good enough for him. \n\nHe wants to make kimchi with her. He wants to get a cat. He didn\u2019t want the mac & cheese his mom made for him. When Emma gave him a new coloring book, he told her about the paintings instead and asked her to get the supplies so they could do it together when he went back home. He asked why she never takes him to museums.\n\nI was so thrown off by the screaming that I yelled back & told her I wasn\u2019t going to downgrade my life to suit her expectations & she hung up on me.\n\nI feel guilty now. I really hadn\u2019t considered how I could be affecting Caleb\u2019s tastes long term but I think she should\u2019ve thought about that herself. She knows how I live.", "created_utc": 1672058654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmfdw/aita_for_spoiling_my_friends_child_and_turning/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The kid is 7! She only saw him a couple times a month. She abandoned the poor thing. How far apart are y'all that she wasn't seeing her son?", "NTA, yo, hook that kid up with some culture, shit. Maybe explain auntie and mama don't roll the same way? You're dope as fuck for taking him in.", "NTA \n\nThis actually made me laugh\u2026she\u2019s so furious about the way your raising her child, yet she dumped him straight back to you at the end of the day?! That\u2019s a whole new level of entitlement \ud83d\ude44 she should be more grateful that you have been caring for her child for so long with what I am interpreting as zero financial compensation.", "NTA. Wow! You are a hero for taking on the added responsibility of a child for long stretches of time, and I'm  assuming you are paying for the extra food. Etc. I'm a bit surprised that the family didn't step up, however I don't know the situation- they may be ill or something. \n\nYou have been a wonderful friend to them, and it's a shame they can't see it. Not many people would have taken on this responsibility. In the process you have opened the child's mind to new things such as museums, which is also great and a broadening experience for the child.\n\nIf your friend is mad, they can always find somewhere else for the child to stay, and if the friend's bad behavior persists, you might insist on it. The person seems very ungrateful.for what you have done.", "I'm gonna say NTA. You took on a child when you didn't have to. \n\nYour friend's family didn't step up to the plate. Your friend visits her child so rarely, she's at risk of becoming \"auntie mom\".\n\nYou shouldn't have to give up your life for a kid you didn't ask for, but happily took on.", "NTA - she's upset because she's jealous that he actually loves spending time with you but she shouldn't have got mad with you, because you're doing her an enormous favour by becoming his primary caregiver. And you probably shouldn't have yelled back, but it's emotional for you both so it's understandable.\n\nThis was always going to be difficult and I think you both need to talk it through - it seems to have surprised you both - but he was always going to bond with you and gain a bit of independence from her. There may be some things you can both do that will make this a bit easier on you all - he takes some of his preferred art materials when he sees her so he can show her and she can feel involved, she finds something 'special' that you and he don't do, to do one-on-one with him when she sees him etc. \n\nSuggest you sort this out and most importantly sit him down and tell him he's done nothing wrong, you both love him, and then keep talking so you can iron out any upsets before he is impacted by them", "NTA- She is an absentee parent to Caleb and it was put on display and she is now very embarrassed about it. Her daughter may be sick but only seeing and talking to your son a couple times a week!? She could easily call him every night to talk. None of this is your fault. You helped her out and took care of this child and eased him into your lifestyle to his benefit and yours. She just needed to call and have conversation with you about the exciting activities you have introduced Caleb to and she should be thanking you everyday for the help your giving her", "NTA.  This is about her not knowing her son anymore.  You're not spoiling him by cooking, doing crafts, and visiting museums.  They are things he's interested in and he's wondering why his mom doesn't spend time with him or want to learn about his new interests.  Having a kid in the hospital is horribly difficult, so I sympathize with her there, but she needs to make an effort to be there for her son too.", "NTA \n\nYou did her a HUGE favor by taking her son in when her family didn\u2019t want to. You have no reason to feel guilty. She\u2019s being ungrateful because you didn\u2019t have to take her son in. She chooses to only see her son once a month then wonders why he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her. I mean she can\u2019t even take him to see his sister.", "NTA you just opened up his world \ud83c\udf0e.", "You\u2019re certainly NTA what a kindness you\u2019re doing for your friend and for her son. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for him to not be seeing or hearing from his family.", "NTA NTA NTA!! You are an amazing person for loving on this boy. Mom needs to realize that you can't uproot a 7 year old child and expect everything to be hunky dory when you see him again. Personally I wouldn't be able to cope going that long without seeing any of my young children, but if I had no choice I would be so grateful to have someone like you to entrust them too.", "NAH. Your friend is having a hard time now because of her daughter's health situation, but she may never be in a position to do all the stuff with Caleb that you have been doing. Caleb will understand, in time, that she is his mother, and that the relationship you have with him is wonderful, but not that of a mother and son. In no way will I suggest to you that you lower your standards for how you treat Caleb or the activities he and you have together. In time, his mother will be grateful that you are taking so good care of her son and doing so much to make him miss her as little as possible. If that doesn't happen, then she is a ginormous AH, but let us give her the benefit of the doubt for now.", "NAH you are a hero for taking such great care of her son  when she is in a very difficult situation with her other child. Hopefully she will eventually see that and be grateful. She probably feels both guilty and jealous thst he\u2019s having such great experiences with you when she is unable to provide this level of care herself.", "NAH. I think your friend is just going through I hard time. I'd never be able to keep my emotions in check throughout that. Some of those things might have been hurtful, but she didn't really mean it. It must also be hard to see that there's a possibility her son is better off with someone else. Even if it's just a fleeting thought, that would be devastating to compare the two lives her son has when you look at it on surface level.", "NTA she has taken huge advantage of your friendship and you have performed beautifully as a caretaker for this boy. Honestly this sounds like a lifetime movie plot in some aspects. Hopefully it has a happy ending and mom learns that she has to actively reconnect with her son to make things right, and appreciates you instead of resents you.", "NTA, possibly (depending on how she follows up on this, what triggered the initial reaction, etc.) NAH.\nIt's understandable that she feels shitty about not being able to provide her kid with a lot of things he likes now. But it doesn't sound like you \"turned him against her\" in the sense of talking badly about the life with his mom. I hope for everyone's sake that together, you find a way to make Caleb understand why perhaps certain things are easier for you to provide, and to make the time he spends with you feel like a happy addition instead of a \"better\" or \"different\" version of what he doesn't have at his mom's.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sending u guys positive and healing vibes \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99", "NTA - You've been a wonderful friend and caretaker. I am sure your friend is under a huge amount of stress. It sounds like her family is unsupportive and she's not able to do a great job balancing the needs of her kids right now. If your ward is in a good school district, maybe reach out to the guidance counselors and see what support he might get through them for the abandonment he must feel. Would it be possible to invite his mom over for a craft or cooking night? I know that's even more work for you, but it might ease some of the transition when he goes home.", "Her parents house is 10 minutes from me but the children\u2019s hospital is in a neighboring state, about 90 minutes away.", "In regards to her family - they\u2019re being dicks. That\u2019s it. They won\u2019t care for him because they want her to move out and stop depending on them. I understand their position in general but this is not typical circumstances and they\u2019re being assholes.", "Don\u2019t insist on him going back. You have done a amazing job. It could have been quite traumatic to have mom dump you off but you have made this fun and enjoyable for him.  \n\nMaybe talk to him about not complaining about the mac and cheese and about how mom would like to take him to museums but she just cannot and not to aak about that.  Everyone is digging at mom and it sounds like it is deserved but she is his mom and loves him In her own way.", "I feel so sad that Caleb isn't older and could demand to stay with the OP. It sounds like his life is far better there. Yes the other child is sick but this woman has just dumped this poor boy for three months.", "I can tell that it has not been easy for him but he tries to keep it to himself. He was bullied for crying in school after his father died last year and I think that has deeply affected how he shares his feelings\u2026 I\u2019d love to get him in therapy but I have no power to do it so I periodically remind him that his guidance counselors and I will always listen if he wants to talk.", "I see where you're coming from, but I think the N A H rating is a bit too soft on the mother. Her scream yelling was definitely an AH move, although for the reasons you list I certainly understand *why* she is acting poorly and think - if this is out of character for the mother - OP should give her friend some grace, which it sounds like that's the case. \n\nTangentially, I find it sad and sweet the son wants to do these things with his mom. It really highlights how wonderful of a job OP is doing with him. I'm guessing (hoping) the mother is feeling guilty for not having the emotional capacity to care for both children and is the genesis of why she acted the way she did. Keep up the great work OP, you're doing great.", "This is exactly why I feel guilty, I think. Thank you.", "90 minutes away is not that far. Especially if you're a *good* parent and that's the distance between you and your small child.", "That's \"just\" a three hour roundtrip, I know several people driving double that to see their kid a few times a week when they have another kid in the hospital.\n\nNTA", "People here are incredibly harsh on his mother. I'm seeing things a different way but I could be wrong. Aside from you, she doesn't have a support system at all, not even from her parents. They're hell bent on kicking her out and her 2 kids. She's more than likely really struggling being away from one child and watching another one in the hospital in critical condition. She's struggling with juggling all of that. She isn't necessarily a negligent parent, she's unable to multitask. She lost the father of the children too just last year, so I can't imagine how overwhelming it must all be to be a single parent all of a sudden. I don't know, but it sounds like she's burned out and running on fumes all this point and not being able to give her attention.\n\nOP, maybe tone down the expensive hobbies a bit and maybe help him bond with his mother more, find out her hobbies and continue to talk about her and talk to her. She has every right to feel threatened because honestly, it looks like she's losing everything. The guy, the support, the child in the hospital, and now even the bond with her other child. Her anger may be misplaced but gosh, I really think she needs help. If she's unable to make it, maybe meet half way or take him to see his mom. Reestablish their connection. She deserves to have her family intact.", "You\u2019ve opened the world to Caleb and it\u2019s a shame that the mom appears to be embarrassed and jealous that you\u2019ve done so much for him. Eventually, he\u2019ll return home. If you can afford it, maybe a membership to the museum might be a generous parting gift so he can continue to develop culturally. NTA in ANY way, shape or form!!  For many children who are struggling at home, just one attentive person can make a world of difference. You\u2019re it for Caleb.", "Don\u2019t feel guilty. She decided to dump him on you. You decided to make the best of it.\n\nShe needs to get her shit together. She\u2019s likely receiving Social Security benefits for the kids. She could very easily buy a family museum membership with that money.\n\nI bought one for my family to a great zoo for $120. For a year.", "Besides, kids forget things. They're less likely to forget people. He would still probably trade all of it to be with his family.", "It is if there's no one to watch the one in hospital. Dad doesn't seem around otherwise the parents would have a kid each and swap. Grandparents are useless. You can't leave a 4yo alone in hospital for more than the time it takes for a quick shower when they're asleep. Hospital staff make kids better they don't supervise or do personal care. A kid older than a baby in hospital can't be left alone for a few hours.", "Asking OP to tone down her LIFE in her own HOME is ridiculous. And it\u2019s not like she\u2019s lavishing the poor kid with FAO Schwartz; she\u2019s spending TIME with him. This poor child has a messy home life but because of his mom\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d OP needs to what\u2026stop spending time with the kid? Giving him the attention he is severely lacking\u2026? What do you suggest OP do? \n\nShe\u2019s NTA and the mom isn\u2019t entirely an A H either just yet. She\u2019s entitled to feel what she\u2019s feeling but she ALSO should look out for her son who is being borderline neglected. Their home life is super unstable and idk who\u2019s fault that is but it isn\u2019t OP\u2019s fault.", "I am also seeing things your way.  From OP's description, the mother is alone and definitively needs help. I'm not saying it is OP's job to support more than they do already. But to me it is a given to at least explain the wealth & situation difference to the child. Especially since OP does not come from emotional hardship the mother is in."]}
