I\u2019m not wealthy but I make enough to very comfortably support myself. I work from home & have a flexible schedule so I have a lot of time to live how I want. \n\nI have a complicated friendship with Emma (27F) because I love her but she frustrates me. Emma is a single mom with 2 children, Caleb (7M) & Grace (4F). Grace has had serious lung problems since birth & contracted RSV in Oct & has been hospitalized since. It\u2019s been a horrible time & she is finally more stable now but not well.\n\nEarly into grace\u2019s hospitalization, Emma asked me to take Caleb. Emma lives with her parents who were not willing to watch him full time so I happily took him in & temporarily converted my den into a room for him. He\u2019s a sweet kid who\u2019s been though a lot & I\u2019m happy to give him some quiet space. \n\nI\u2019ve never taken care of a child long term before & my life was not set up for kids but he has adjusted well. I love cooking and collecting special ingredients to use and try in new recipes & Caleb just rolled with it. I grow micro greens at home and he\u2019s loved watching the process & incorporating them into his food. He hasn\u2019t liked everything but he\u2019s always willing to try. \n\nI like pour painting & we\u2019ve been having craft nights where he gets to experiment with his own canvases which he\u2019s enjoyed. We also take trips to museums & shows. I\u2019ve kept up my regular life & luckily, he was thrilled to come along. I would\u2019ve struggled to come up with a more kid specific lifestyle. \n\nEmma usually only calls weekly & sees him maybe once or twice a month which bothers me but the Grace situation must be draining so I try not to hold against her but it does mean that Emma really has no idea what we do day to day. \n\nYesterday was Christmas & he was going home to visit his mom. I sent him with his gifts (shoes & books) plus gifts for his mom & sister. \n\nHis grandma dropped him off last night & didn\u2019t really say much to me which was weird. Caleb looked sad & didn\u2019t want to talk about it so I let it be & we watched a movie before bed.\n\nLate that night, I got a call from Emma scream crying at me for ruining her relationship with her son. I guess it didn\u2019t go super well & she feels that Caleb is now spoiled because of me and that what she can provide is no longer good enough for him. \n\nHe wants to make kimchi with her. He wants to get a cat. He didn\u2019t want the mac & cheese his mom made for him. When Emma gave him a new coloring book, he told her about the paintings instead and asked her to get the supplies so they could do it together when he went back home. He asked why she never takes him to museums.\n\nI was so thrown off by the screaming that I yelled back & told her I wasn\u2019t going to downgrade my life to suit her expectations & she hung up on me.\n\nI feel guilty now. I really hadn\u2019t considered how I could be affecting Caleb\u2019s tastes long term but I think she should\u2019ve thought about that herself.

The kid is 7! She only saw him a couple times a month. She abandoned the poor thing. How far apart are y'all that she wasn't seeing her son?", "NTA, yo, hook that kid up with some culture, shit. Maybe explain auntie and mama don't roll the same way? You're dope as fuck for taking him in.", "NTA \n\nThis actually made me laugh\u2026she\u2019s so furious about the way your raising her child, yet she dumped him straight back to you at the end of the day?! That\u2019s a whole new level of entitlement \ud83d\ude44 she should be more grateful that you have been caring for her child for so long with what I am interpreting as zero financial compensation.", "NTA. Wow! You are a hero for taking on the added responsibility of a child for long stretches of time, and I'm  assuming you are paying for the extra food. Etc. I'm a bit surprised that the family didn't step up, however I don't know the situation- they may be ill or something. \n\nYou have been a wonderful friend to them, and it's a shame they can't see it. Not many people would have taken on this responsibility. In the process you have opened the child's mind to new things such as museums, which is also great and a broadening experience for the child.\n\nIf your friend is mad, they can always find somewhere else for the child to stay, and if the friend's bad behavior persists, you might insist on it. The person seems very ungrateful.for what you have done.", "I'm gonna say NTA. You took on a child when you didn't have to. \n\nYour friend's family didn't step up to the plate. Your friend visits her child so rarely, she's at risk of becoming \"auntie mom\".\n\nYou shouldn't have to give up your life for a kid you didn't ask for, but happily took on.", "NTA - she's upset because she's jealous that he actually loves spending time with you but she shouldn't have got mad with you, because you're doing her an enormous favour by becoming his primary caregiver. And you probably shouldn't have yelled back, but it's emotional for you both so it's understandable.\n\nThis was always going to be difficult and I think you both need to talk it through - it seems to have surprised you both - but he was always going to bond with you and gain a bit of independence from her. There may be some things you can both do that will make this a bit easier on you all - he takes some of his preferred art materials when he sees her so he can show her and she can feel involved, she finds something 'special' that you and he don't do, to do one-on-one with him when she sees him etc. \n\nSuggest you sort this out and most importantly sit him down and tell him he's done nothing wrong, you both love him, and then keep talking so you can iron out any upsets before he is impacted by them", "NTA- She is an absentee parent to Caleb and it was put on display and she is now very embarrassed about it. Her daughter may be sick but only seeing and talking to your son a couple times a week!? She could easily call him every night to talk. None of this is your fault. You helped her out and took care of this child and eased him into your lifestyle to his benefit and yours. She just needed to call and have conversation with you about the exciting activities you have introduced Caleb to and she should be thanking you everyday for the help your giving her", "NTA.  This is about her not knowing her son anymore.  You're not spoiling him by cooking, doing crafts, and visiting museums.  They are things he's interested in and he's wondering why his mom doesn't spend time with him or want to learn about his new interests.  Having a kid in the hospital is horribly difficult, so I sympathize with her there, but she needs to make an effort to be there for her son too.", "NTA \n\nYou did her a HUGE favor by taking her son in when her family didn\u2019t want to. You have no reason to feel guilty. She\u2019s being ungrateful because you didn\u2019t have to take her son in. She chooses to only see her son once a month then wonders why he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her. I mean she can\u2019t even take him to see his sister.", "NTA you just opened up his world \ud83c\udf0e.", "You\u2019re certainly NTA what a kindness you\u2019re doing for your friend and for her son. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for him to not be seeing or hearing from his family.", "NTA NTA NTA!! You are an amazing person for loving on this boy. Mom needs to realize that you can't uproot a 7 year old child and expect everything to be hunky dory when you see him again. Personally I wouldn't be able to cope going that long without seeing any of my young children, but if I had no choice I would be so grateful to have someone like you to entrust them too.", "NAH. Your friend is having a hard time now because of her daughter's health situation, but she may never be in a position to do all the stuff with Caleb that you have been doing. Caleb will understand, in time, that she is his mother, and that the relationship you have with him is wonderful, but not that of a mother and son. In no way will I suggest to you that you lower your standards for how you treat Caleb or the activities he and you have together. In time, his mother will be grateful that you are taking so good care of her son and doing so much to make him miss her as little as possible. If that doesn't happen, then she is a ginormous AH, but let us give her the benefit of the doubt for now.", "NAH you are a hero for taking such great care of her son  when she is in a very difficult situation with her other child. Hopefully she will eventually see that and be grateful. She probably feels both guilty and jealous thst he\u2019s having such great experiences with you when she is unable to provide this level of care herself.", "NAH. I think your friend is just going through I hard time. I'd never be able to keep my emotions in check throughout that. Some of those things might have been hurtful, but she didn't really mean it. It must also be hard to see that there's a possibility her son is better off with someone else. Even if it's just a fleeting thought, that would be devastating to compare the two lives her son has when you look at it on surface level.", "NTA she has taken huge advantage of your friendship and you have performed beautifully as a caretaker for this boy. Honestly this sounds like a lifetime movie plot in some aspects. Hopefully it has a happy ending and mom learns that she has to actively reconnect with her son to make things right, and appreciates you instead of resents you.", "NTA, possibly (depending on how she follows up on this, what triggered the initial reaction, etc.) NAH.\nIt's understandable that she feels shitty about not being able to provide her kid with a lot of things he likes now. But it doesn't sound like you \"turned him against her\" in the sense of talking badly about the life with his mom. I hope for everyone's sake that together, you find a way to make Caleb understand why perhaps certain things are easier for you to provide, and to make the time he spends with you feel like a happy addition instead of a \"better\" or \"different\" version of what he doesn't have at his mom's.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like her family is unsupportive and she's not able to do a great job balancing the needs of her kids right now. If your ward is in a good school district, maybe reach out to the guidance counselors and see what support he might get through them for the abandonment he must feel.

I'm seeing things a different way but I could be wrong. Aside from you, she doesn't have a support system at all, not even from her parents. They're hell bent on kicking her out and her 2 kids. She's more than likely really struggling being away from one child and watching another one in the hospital in critical condition. She's struggling with juggling all of that. She isn't necessarily a negligent parent, she's unable to multitask. She lost the father of the children too just last year, so I can't imagine how overwhelming it must all be to be a single parent all of a sudden. I don't know, but it sounds like she's burned out and running on fumes all this point and not being able to give her attention.\n\nOP, maybe tone down the expensive hobbies a bit and maybe help him bond with his mother more, find out her hobbies and continue to talk about her and talk to her. She has every right to feel threatened because honestly, it looks like she's losing everything. The guy, the support, the child in the hospital, and now even the bond with her other child. Her anger may be misplaced but gosh, I really think she needs help. If she's unable to make it, maybe meet half way or take him to see his mom. Reestablish their connection.

They're less likely to forget people. He would still probably trade all of it to be with his family.", "It is if there's no one to watch the one in hospital. Dad doesn't seem around otherwise the parents would have a kid each and swap. Grandparents are useless. You can't leave a 4yo alone in hospital for more than the time it takes for a quick shower when they're asleep. Hospital staff make kids better they don't supervise or do personal care. A kid older than a baby in hospital can't be left alone for a few hours.", "Asking OP to tone down her LIFE in her own HOME is ridiculous.

Meanwhile, mom and the 6F are really sick, and the 2M's got the sniffles but that's not slowing him down any! Hubby stepped in to help the first night, so that Dad could get some sleep (in the ICU room) while helping monitor the 4F and keep her calm. Next night while hubby's checking in, 6F needs to get to the ER, and they have one car. So hubby takes their car (we don't have kid seats), picks me, and drops me off to babysit 2M and gets mom and 6F to the ER. Then spends night two in the ICU while the parents are downstairs in the ER. The family finally steps in on day three and offers meaningful support. (Kids are now all home and recovering.)\n\nMy point with this is that having a 4 year old in the hospital is draining on its own. They can't advocate for themselves, have little emotional regulation on the best days, and are still working on communication. You don't get more than 20 min or 30 minutes at a time, and all around you are more very sick children. It's fucking awful. And Emma has the support of one person.\n\nOP, Emma is stressed to the breaking point. The people she should be counting on are either dead or not stepping up. I can only imagine what's going through her head, but none of it is likely positive. And you are the safest person to unleash on, as you aren't going to kick her out, you clearly aren't going to abandon Caleb, and you can't negatively affect Grace's care.\n\nYou're doing great. You're giving Caleb a safe and loving environment when a lot of other people can't or won't. You have nothing to feel guilty for. Maybe find some time to visit Emma and Grace with Caleb. Do a little more heavy lifting, and forgive your friend for being on the brink of a breakdown. She's got really good reasons for that.", "NTA. You are exposing him to amazing things.", "NAH I can see why the mom is upset you show him things that well she can't she doesn't have the money for any of that, as she is trying to care for his sick sister, but you didn't do anything wrong you were just living your life but maybe try to get him to be more understanding that his mom can't do those things as you can but his mom does still love him", "NTA but maybe start emphasizing to him the importance of saying thank you when someone gives you something", "ESH your friend is going through a very rough time right now. You kinda set her up to fail by showing Caleb a life where a person who can spend all their free time on a kid (because they have the money and aren't already burnt out by a kid). It would be different if it was like a one night thing where it is one day of fun and then back to normal but you made this expensive and time consuming lifestyle his normal and what did you expect your friend to do? What did you expect Caleb to do?

She doesn\u2019t answer when we call. I know she\u2019s depressed but I don\u2019t even know where to begin. \n\nI do want to clarify one thing here, just because I\u2019ve seen a few comments on it  - Emma was a single mom long before her ex died. He went off the rails and pretty much abandoned them when Grace was 6 months old. He\u2019d occasionally show up to steal from, terrorize and/or dote on his kids, depending on what stage of his addiction he was cycling through but he wasn\u2019t a consistent presence for years before his death. His parents are a very sporadic presence, they were the ones who stayed with Grace on Christmas but I think that\u2019s the only time they\u2019ve seen her in the hospital. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that makes it easier emotionally - if anything, it only further complicates the grieving process. But it\u2019s probably worth noting.", "I do not. His school and his pediatrician both know he\u2019s in my care but I have nothing official beyond that. \n\nA lawyer is a smart move but I don\u2019t want to do anything that will make her feel like I\u2019m trying to actually steal her child.", "Why?
