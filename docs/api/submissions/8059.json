They\u2019re acting like saying he has a wife is equal to giving out medical information like the dude has cancer or a third arm growing out of his ass. They\u2019re acting like you told clients some super hush hush secret shit about him.\n\nThe guy\u2019s wife *shouldn\u2019t have been some massive secret.* There are no good reasons for that, only \u201che was fucking or implying he would fuck these clients for sales\u201d reasons, and that is fucked up on his part.\n\nSomething is definitely fucky here.\n\nMax was married but these women didn\u2019t know. Did he wear a wedding ring, or did he specifically take it off while working? Did he have zero pictures of his wife?\n\nMost importantly: are you telling me these women became this attached to Max and they never, ever asked him if he was single, which would require Max to blatantly lie to them?\n\nDoes he have no social media presence that they could have stalked? Based on how these women reacted, I find it difficult to believe they weren\u2019t looking him up on some social media platforms. Did he just have none, was it locked down so they couldn\u2019t see, or did he just not ever mention a wife and hide her existence? Or (even worse) did he have a separate public profile for his sales clients that showed him as a single guy, which would require a lot of extra effort on his part to keep up the lie.\n\nPoint is hiding that he is married would take more effort than you\u2019re giving him credit for. He would have to be actively hiding his wedding ring or choosing not to wear it at work. He would have to alter his social media or hide it completely. He would have to go out of his way to never, ever talk about his personal life, which is counterintuitive to how these women *clearly* felt about him and how they felt they knew him.\n\nUsually good sales people connect with their customers, and personal anecdotes can go a long way in that. So either Max never talked about his personal life or he intentionally lied about it.\n\nYou say you don\u2019t think he did anything wrong, but bro, I think you\u2019re being willfully naive there, because if he was fucking any of those women it would be kind of a (bigger) shitstorm.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for mentioning he had a wife. It shouldn\u2019t have been some top secret military grade info that he was married.
