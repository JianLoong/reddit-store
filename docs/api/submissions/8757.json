I think it\u2019s a reasonable thing to ask about. Hopefully she has told her therapist about her travel plans and gotten a thumbs up.", "NTA - even if she\u2019s gotten it under control, going to the Vatican could majorly trigger those delusions again and she could end up doing something to get herself or your whole group in trouble. It\u2019s not just a normal church. You\u2019re going to the Catholic Church\u2019s headquarters.", "NTA, but I will tread carefully as this is a sensitive topic. I'd voice my concerns to your mom that it might trigger some behaviors that might affect your cousin, your family, the area and the people around. I'd let your mom decide whether to invite them. Suggest that give Rosalia the option not to join the visit in the chapel specifically if she feels uncomfortable. Given that she's in therapy now, I believe your cousin knows herself and her situation better than anyone else. if she decides that she wants to join, then suggest that she checks in with her therapist about the plan. This could be an opportunity for her to see how far she had progressed or maybe it is a bit too soon. If the therapist says no, that's the only time I would strongly discourage her from joining, unless she is ready to face the consequences of her behavior/reaction once there. \n\nAs a family, you may choose to distance yourself from her if anything untoward happen, or let it slide. As long as you arent outright saying that she shouldnt join you without properly saying your worries like an adult, then NTA.", "I'm a little bit on the fence myself. \n\nRather than encouraging your mom not to invite her, maybe it would be a good idea to voice your concerns, but say like hey lets talk to her about what would be the best way to support her. \n\nRosalia sounds like she should be able to make an informed choice, along with her therapist, if it's a good idea to attend and it would be wrong to take that decision away from her. But you can be proactive and figure out how to support her best and minimize the chances of a negative reaction or minimize the harm of it. \n\nShe also may just not want to go for exactly the reasons youve mentioned and you can support her in that too and be proud of her for making decisions to protect her mental health.", "I would love to be a fly on the wall for this.", "NTA, especially because your family is celebrating YOUR graduation. You have every right to decide who you want to have there. However, even if the occasion was your mother's birthday or your parents' anniversary or the like, it wouldn't be wrong to mention a legitimate concern beforehand.", "INFO:\n\nAre you concerned that this trip my be bad for Rosalia's overall mental health?\n\nOr are you concerned that she'll have an episode and you'll have to deal with that?", "YWBTA...  Ask Rosalia if it's a trigger for her.  It's wrong to exclude her because you imagine she \"might\" have an issue.  You are a high school student, not a medical professional.  Your thinking is ableist and discriminatory.", "NTA for being concerned, but please talk to your cousin directly about your concerns instead of going over her head and let her make this call. Disabled folks can and should decide for themselves whether or not they can handle a potential trigger, and respect for a person's autonomy is often healing in and of itself. \n\nWhile I certainly don't know anything more than what you've described regarding the schizophrenia diagnosis, I do want to make you aware that the specific \"delusions\" you described are things that children are commonly told by adults involved in cults, who are often quite skilled at manipulating them into believing such things. It's really important to distinguish between genuine delusions and false beliefs that someone was manipulated into believing by abusive people, and it's, unfortunately, quite common for complex trauma to be misdiagnosed as psychosis (as well as for deeply traumatized individuals to have one or more psychotic episodes before they process the trauma). I'd really, really suggest talking to your cousin about finding a trauma therapist.", "YWBTA if you used the exact wording \"it would be a terrible idea\".\nY W N B T A if you asked your mum, for instance, if there's a tactful way to voice these concerns to Mateo and Rosalia without immediately going \"DON'T BRING HER, SHE'S GOING TO MAKE A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF\".\n\nBy your own admission, she's doing a lot better than she used to. She got healthy and through college by herself, with a father who didn't get her any therapy and a mother who actively worked against her. That speaks volumes for her capacity to stay grounded and in touch with reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sistine Chapel is full of exquisitely done religious imagery that has had profound emotional effects on more than one visitor in the past. Stendhal syndrome and Jerusalem syndrome are a thing.\n\nTalk your concerns over with your mother. And talk to Rosalia if you can be tactful about it. But please don't say \"it's a terrible idea\".\n\nEdit: typo", "YWBTA: sure- Rosalia has had religious delusions in the past, but it does sound like she\u2019s doing pretty well now. I\u2019m sure herself/her father can decide if the trip is right for them.\n\nBut OP- are you worried about your cousins mental health? Or are you worried she could ruin your trip or cause a scene and embarrass you? Because that\u2019s certainly what it sounds like.\n\nI mean, would you bring it up with your mother if Rosalia was invited to thanksgiving? It\u2019s a lot of eating and she\u2019s had issues with food before\u2026", "YWBTA. You are not your cousin's keeper, and you don't get to decide what kind of situations might be difficult for her based on her past. If she's been putting herself through college and getting herself to therapy, it sound like she's trying to move forward with her life and goals. Not that it's any of your business, but do you even know if she's on medication? How successful her 6 months of therapy have been?", "Please talk to Rosalia directly. She should decide with her therapist if she wants to visit the Sistine Chapel or not. More importantly, don't put her under pressure to decide now. Please tell her, that it is perfectly okay with you to turn around at the portal, and that you will defend her decision against other family members (if necessary). If she just can't walk in on that day, fine, you'll spend the rest of the day together. She could get a coffee (very overpriced) or just walk around outside instead.", "YTA. If she can go to uni and is in therapy I really feel you are just looking for excuses.\n\nYou mention the anorexia in passing, do you.....express concerns about her being around food a lot?", "Honestly I think Yta. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s any of your business really, you\u2019re 18. Your mother can invite who she likes and her brother can decide if his daughter should come. You don\u2019t know the full extent of her condition. If you are so concerned about being around her you could refuse your own invitation.", "YWBTA - that\u2019s for Rosalia and her therapist to decide. If they are fine with it and think she is healthy enough to go there, it\u2019s really none of your business. Speaking from a disability perspective, this kind of exclusion is so real and hurtful.", "Sounds like a good time! Take the risk!\ud83d\ude02", "YWBTA - It's not your place to make that decision. \n\nIf you don't want her to go because you're afraid she will make a scene, maybe you shouldn't go with them. That is a problem you have, not her.\n\nIf you don't want her to go because you genuinely think it might set her back in her health, then you need to make peace with letting people make their own decisions.\n\nSide note, the idea of \"high functioning and low functioning\" is polarizing when we talk about people. At the end of the day, we are all \"functioning\" by living our lives to the best of our ability at that moment. That is a measurement only subjective to ourselves, and not other people's lives.", "YWNBTA\n\nWhy would your mom think this is a good idea?", "NTA. This seems like a legitimate concern that you should be able to talk to your mother about. You\u2019re not suggesting that your cousin shouldn\u2019t be allowed to come on the trip merely the trip to the Vatican might not be good for her mental health.", "No NTA. It doesn't seem unreasonable to have that concern, or to express it to your mum.\n\nI think it's ultimately probably not your decision. But I think you have a right to expect your input to be given due weight.", "NTA. The Sistine Chapel is overwhelming and awe-inspiring for people who aren\u2019t schizophrenic with religious delusions. This is a very valid concern.", "YWBTA, it's nice that you're concerned about her, but she's mature enough to make her own choice on the matter.\n\nUnless you know the ins and it's of her therapy and progress, you're not in a suitable position to decide what could or couldn't trigger an episode.\n\nIf someone made a choice for me based on my mental health without consulting me, I would be furious. Especially if it meant I missed out on what could be a once in a lifetime trip.", "NTA it doesn't sound like an appropriate place for her to visit. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with bringing up your concerns. You wouldn't invite someone with major sensory issues to a rock concert, you wouldn't ask someone in a wheelchair to go hiking with you, you wouldn't ask someone who get migraines triggered by not eating to fast with you on a spiritual journey. In this case you don't want to bring someone with religious delusionals to a religious site. It would be unkind to bring her. The fact everyone around you seems to be denying the truth is really only harming your cousin.", "YWBTA. \n\nThe reasonable thing to do here is check with Rosalia if its a trigger for her. You do not get to decide on her behalf and exclude her based on your (poorly informed) presumptions. \n\nTheres nothing religious about the Sistine Chapel anyway, its basically a museum. Zero holy water involved.", "Ywbra, she is high functioning. Knows she needs therapie.

If it's the case, that could be a really bad idea to take her to a religious site, especially if she had delusional ideas around the theme of religion.   \n\n\nBut, as other pointed out, a good start beside talking to your mum, would be talking directly with your cousin, asking her about how she feels about the idea of going, and maybe suggest that she talks about the trip to her therapist. That is even more important because in schizophrenia a common symptom is also idea of persecution, and being excluded (without being even consulted) of a trip, espacially one in a religious site, could totally trigger that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWish you the best, aswell as your cousin.", "ESH- its wrong to leave your cousin out due to a disability, but at the same time this could be potentially triggering.

Having a religious delusion in the past doesn't mean you automatically have one forever and can never get past it.  Many issues can be treated and even cured. \n\nI used to have extreme needle phobia, but after therapy and hard work, I finally got over it.

If she is following properly, her therapist will help her decide. But again the parents should really think this through, not only because she can \"destroy\" the trip but also because they will feel incredibly guilty if she relapse which is very scary because we are never sure if the person will leave the delusional state."]}
