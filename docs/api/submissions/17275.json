{"id": 17275, "submission_id": "13i427k", "title": "AITA for forcing my daughter to learn sign language?", "selftext": "I (49 F) recently married my husband (52M) who has a deaf 7 year old daughter. She communicates solely via ASL. \n\nFor some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn\u2019t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn\u2019t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn\u2019t happen and as long as she\u2019s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can\u2019t exactly punish her for not liking them.\n\nNow, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her. \n\nHowever, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren\u2019t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she\u2019s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.\n\nThis issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nSo given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\nWell, my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684145717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i427k/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_learn_sign/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of talking and asking your daughter how she feels, or consider a different babysitter he pulls out the nuclear option to your relationship. \n\nYou are TA because you throw you daughter under the bus for marriage's sake and threaten to kick her out instead of being a mother and trying to understand her and offer her a bail out aka a different babysitter", "INFO: why is the daughter watching SD?

You can't make your daughter learn it, but you can take away things that you could only trust her with if she could.\n\nI won't pretend that your daughter isn't being unbelievably selfish and bratty. However, as an estranged adult child, I cannot help but feel that there's not enough asking of why here. I do not know for sure, but considering your daughter's age, I cannot rule out that she's scared that your stepdaughter will replace her in your heart. Is this rational? No, but it's worth remembering that you were her only adult in the world for the best part of 15 years, and just as she is about to reach the milestone of becoming an adult, a new man comes into your life with a child ten years her junior who needs more care than she did.\n\nI think you need to talk to your daughter away from the steps about this. Explain to her that marrying your new husband or being a good mother figure for your stepdaughter doesn't replace her father or her. Make sure she feels, not just knows, that she is seen and supported, it's just that stepdaughter needs extra care because she's deaf and because she's younger and in a less independent stage of her life.\n\nBy all means, encourage her to fly the nest, even if just temporarily, but remember this.\n\n\"It is not enough to love the young, but make sure they feel loved.\"\nJohn Bosco\n\nETA: for clarity, I don't think stepdaughter has a horse in the asshole race because she probably doesn't entirely understand what's going on here, due to age and daughter refusing to learn how to communicate with her.\n\nAs for the husband threatening divorce over this... I feel mixed because on the one hand, punishing OP for the behaviour of her daughter sucks, but I would expect him, given his circumstances, to put his child above a spouse.", "YTA for having your daughter babysit when she won't learn ASL. That's ridiculous; find someone else.\n\nI think you need to realise that, from your daughter's perspective, this relationship is still relatively new and as a near-adult she is less likely to see your stepdaughter as her stepsister. To her, you're changing the agreement re her living at home for college. I don't think you're wrong re ASL; tbh it's a good to to learn irrespective of living with someone who communicates this way.

I also think she sucks for taking it out on a child.\n\nI wouldn't call you an asshole for saying your daughter needs to learn or find some other way to make money, she should absolutely not be babysitting this child if she refuses to learn to communicate. You are an asshole if you make it a requirement for living in her own home, she didn't choose this. I feel sorry for your SD in this situation, and I find it a little appalling that you would leave her in the care of a teenager that demonstrably dislikes her to that extent, but I think you need to work on your own relationship with your daughter before trying to facilitate theirs.

She communicates solely via ASL. \n\nFor some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn\u2019t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn\u2019t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn\u2019t happen and as long as she\u2019s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can\u2019t exactly punish her for not liking them.\n\nNow, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her. \n\nHowever, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren\u2019t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she\u2019s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.\n\nThis issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nSo given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\nWell, my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And why don\u2019t you seem at all concerned about how your own child is feeling?", "Learning an entire language is not a like kinda thing it\u2019s a love thing.", "And kicking your daughter out of the house is going to make that conversation easier?\n\n\"Why do we never see my older step sis anymore?\"\n\"Oh we kicked her out and she now hates all of us\"", "I get this, and it\u2019s not a great feeling I\u2019m sure. However, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that your marriage was for YOU, not for your daughter.", "I strongly disagree:\n\n- the original plan was for the daughter to stay home for college, so no dorms and we're talking of years before OP could be alone and free to live, this is in no way reasonable.\n\n- a parent love life come second to the child in certain cases but not all, the more obvious being no abuse of any sort, no strong disturbance of the kids life (moving across country for example) and a practically adult teenager. We're not talking of a five years old or thirteen years old she'll be eighteen in two weeks, she is not a child anymore.", "I feel like ur just saying this bc he's a man. Any other time a woman posts saying she wants to leave because of how step children are acting she's told she should leave and she's right. But now a man is saying he wants to leave because of how a step child is treating him and his disabled daughter, he's some manipulative person trying to get a young woman kicked out of her home?", "Perhaps I should have said her understanding is most likely the tip of the iceberg...", "Oof way to make assumptions on gender. That\u2019s gross. I\u2019ve commented elsewhere, both parents suck for blending a family that wasn\u2019t ready to be blended. It\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t put work into making the 17yo feel comfortable with a new family. The root of the issue is op and husband. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re seeing that when you made your comments. The daughter is taking it out on the wrong person, SD, but the only one that she can act out against without authority.", "I mean you're the one saying he somehow calculated this and just wanted a house for him his daughter and his wife and wanted to obviously kick ops daughter from the start with literally no fucking evidence but ok sure I'm the weird one here"]}
