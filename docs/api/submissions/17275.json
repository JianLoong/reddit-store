{"id": 17275, "submission_id": "13i427k", "title": "AITA for forcing my daughter to learn sign language?", "selftext": "I (49 F) recently married my husband (52M) who has a deaf 7 year old daughter. She communicates solely via ASL. \n\nFor some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn\u2019t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn\u2019t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn\u2019t happen and as long as she\u2019s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can\u2019t exactly punish her for not liking them.\n\nNow, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her. \n\nHowever, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren\u2019t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she\u2019s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.\n\nThis issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nSo given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\nWell, my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684145717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i427k/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_learn_sign/", "score": 8623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't make your daughter learn it, but you can take away things that you could only trust her with if she could.\n\nI won't pretend that your daughter isn't being unbelievably selfish and bratty. However, as an estranged adult child, I cannot help but feel that there's not enough asking of why here. I do not know for sure, but considering your daughter's age, I cannot rule out that she's scared that your stepdaughter will replace her in your heart. Is this rational? No, but it's worth remembering that you were her only adult in the world for the best part of 15 years, and just as she is about to reach the milestone of becoming an adult, a new man comes into your life with a child ten years her junior who needs more care than she did.\n\nI think you need to talk to your daughter away from the steps about this. Explain to her that marrying your new husband or being a good mother figure for your stepdaughter doesn't replace her father or her. Make sure she feels, not just knows, that she is seen and supported, it's just that stepdaughter needs extra care because she's deaf and because she's younger and in a less independent stage of her life.\n\nBy all means, encourage her to fly the nest, even if just temporarily, but remember this.\n\n\"It is not enough to love the young, but make sure they feel loved.\"\nJohn Bosco\n\nETA: for clarity, I don't think stepdaughter has a horse in the asshole race because she probably doesn't entirely understand what's going on here, due to age and daughter refusing to learn how to communicate with her.\n\nAs for the husband threatening divorce over this...

That's ridiculous; find someone else.\n\nI think you need to realise that, from your daughter's perspective, this relationship is still relatively new and as a near-adult she is less likely to see your stepdaughter as her stepsister. To her, you're changing the agreement re her living at home for college. I don't think you're wrong re ASL; tbh it's a good to to learn irrespective of living with someone who communicates this way.

I also think she sucks for taking it out on a child.\n\nI wouldn't call you an asshole for saying your daughter needs to learn or find some other way to make money, she should absolutely not be babysitting this child if she refuses to learn to communicate. You are an asshole if you make it a requirement for living in her own home, she didn't choose this. I feel sorry for your SD in this situation, and I find it a little appalling that you would leave her in the care of a teenager that demonstrably dislikes her to that extent, but I think you need to work on your own relationship with your daughter before trying to facilitate theirs.

You do your stepdaughter no favours here, she needs to learn to communicate with people who don't know ASL, so she's not dependent on you for the rest of your life. \n\nYou chose this life. Your daughter didn't. The girls aren't siblings, they are housemates with nothing in common so stop assuming a relationship that doesn't exist.

It's a more than acceptable agrrement that you offer to pay for her collage dorm if she doesn't want to learn ASL.\n\nMore of my opinion: I think you have no right to force her to learn ASL. I think you were irresponsible to leave a deft child with someone who is unable to communicate with her. But the fact that you are willing to pay her accommodation even when she is an adult is very kind of you.\n\n(For context: in my country you have to earn extremely hight points throughout your studies to get a scholarship to study law and there are 5 scholarship places for 100 students. I earned a scholarship which meant that I don't have to pay for university and I earned following scholarships with my high grades and activities that meant I got money from university/government and I paid for my dorm, food, hobbies and other activities. When I moved together with my boyfriend I started to work to be able to pay for a flat (which required mor money than a dorm) and mainwhile kept my grades high to get scholarships.

She\u2019ll probably grow up a lot faster that way, which is good for her, and it will help the household dynamics.\n\nTherapy is probably in order here.", "NTA. It\u2019s really not much to ask for someone to take 5 mins a day to learn to communicate with someone they live with and get paid to care for. That said, your daughter is obviously struggling with this new relationship and family counseling would probs be a good idea because this matter isn\u2019t going to resolve itself. \nAdditional suggestion: make learning ASL more appealing to your daughter in general. Knowing how to sign is a huge benefit when looking for future jobs and she can put on her resume that she can sign and cared for a child who is deaf which will look good when applying for her major in university. Try to make this sound like more of an opportunity than a chore and maybe she\u2019ll respond better to learning ASL.", "Nta, your daughter doesn\u2019t have to like the new family but it shows a complete lack of respect and decency on her behalf that she\u2019s happy to take your money to watch your step daughter but then throws it in your face saying it\u2019s not her problem. In that instance it is 100% her problem as she is looking after her.\n\nYou did the right thing by saying she needs to stay somewhere else if she doesn\u2019t like it. Definitely stop getting her to watch SD though as she clearly doesn\u2019t care if anything happens to her.", "I am going to be clearly biased .

She IS responsible for being involved in the life of her family while she lives at home with you. \nShe has a stepsister now. She needs to learn enough ASL to be able to provide help to her sister if she needs it. \n   I truly believe you should not pay for her dorm room.

It cannot hurt and it really could help.", "NTA - your daughter clearly has issues with audism and needs to be taught a lesson on how to appropriately interact with Deaf folks.

I would be saying the same thing if it were a spoken language.", "Your daughter should be going to the dorm no matter what. All of you will benefit from her no longer having to interact with people she has been very clear she has no interest in, especially your SD who likely has been internalizing this very negative response as something she caused. That\u2019s not a healthy environment and your husband is right to be concerned and considering ways to remove his child from it. So your daughter moves as is appropriate for this next stage in life and in no way a punishment. \n\nBut you should also look into individual and parental-child therapy sessions because her level of disdain and lack of empathy is very concerning. You cannot force her to like the new family members, but you can help her more positively process her emotions. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for trying to find solutions to this situation, but you are TA for ever attempting to leave your SD alone with your daughter when you know how negatively she feels and acts towards SD. That should never have been an option because it\u2019s too detrimental to SD\u2019s well-being.

She communicates solely via ASL. \n\nFor some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn\u2019t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn\u2019t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn\u2019t happen and as long as she\u2019s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can\u2019t exactly punish her for not liking them.\n\nNow, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her. \n\nHowever, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren\u2019t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she\u2019s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.\n\nThis issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nSo given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\nWell, my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Imagine if you acted the same way when you found out he had a daughter with a hearing impairment!)\n\nI\u2019d be looking very hard at the kind of person she\u2019s becoming as an adult and certainly wouldn\u2019t allow her to destroy my marriage because of her cruel and insensitive demeanor.", "NTA you\u2019re really asking for some bare minimum effort on your daughter\u2019s side. She\u2019s almost 18, not 10. Your alternative to pay for her dorm is very generous - you\u2019re not kicking her out on the streets or abandoning her. It\u2019s ok that your daughter is angry, she\u2019s allowed to feel emotions, it\u2019s not ok for her to take it out on her 7 year old step sister. \n\nEveryone on here is talking about you ruining your relationship with your daughter by \u201ckicking her out\u201d but i think your request is reasonable, and that if anything, your daughter is the one damaging the relationship between you two.

Regardless of the babysitting situation, your daughter needs to make an effort to communicate with her step sister - if she doesn\u2019t want to learn ASL, then they should write to each other if that\u2019s an option. But the heart of the matter is that your daughter is being unkind to her step sister and you\u2019re trying to find a solution.

This could be the silent treatment which is manipulative AF or it could be shutting down under feeling manipulated. Forms of silence, protesting communication and mutism are common reactions in kids to feeling overwhelmed and not listened to. The thing about this spectrum of behaviours is there is what some therapists call Capital M Manipulation to abuse and small m manipulation to try to influence situations when actions speaker louder than words (or ASL.)\n\nEveryone manipulates but pre-meditated being manipulative is what we see as bad. It\u2019s actually a huge flaw of the English language we don\u2019t really delineate between manipulate (craves pizza: \u2018hey do you prefer pizza or cooking tonight?) and Manipulate (if you don\u2019t buy pizza I won\u2019t speak to you until I choose) or selfish (no, I have to study before I babysit even though your event is important) and Selfish (your kid, your problem.)\n\nI spent a chunk of my teens not speaking to my parents.

I did not speak to them for 9 months as a very teenage power play.\n\nIt was surprisingly hard work to keep up. It was very lonely, I did not like how bratty I was being and it took a lot of effort to keep up. But I was so intensely unhappy it was the only method I had to convey that. I would have preferred dialogue. At 16 my parents did indeed discuss it again. The answer was no and they stopped any financial support too. I suspect if I\u2019d played nicer it might not have escalated so much\u2026\n\nSo yes I think 17 is not acting well and 7 must be hurt.

Its not great-- and it can be hard to swallow-- but outside of throwing money or paying for a solution-- she needs more mental and emotional help.", "For most of your daughter's life, it's just been you + her. Then, you move her in with a man she doesn't like and his disabled daughter, who I'm sure takes away time and resources that used to be spent on her. In her senior year, you're giving her the responsibilities of learning ASL and babysitting a disabled 7 year old. On top of that, you threaten her that she'll have to move out (whether it's paid for or not it will still feel like rejection) if she doesnt learn a new language. All in her senior year of school, which is stressful enough. \n\nYTA. Clearly.", "YTA for never getting your daughter into therapy. Your husband is also YTA for only considering his child's needs. There are two children here with issues, not just his.", "YTA - you choose a man and his daughter over your daughter, of course she's resentful. Your husband's an AH for marrying you knowing this. Your daughter will completely go NC with you over this.", "A better approach would be to increase her babysitting rate if she learns ASL. In the meantime, find a new babysitter who knows ASL. I'm sure there are students in the program you were in who would be delighted to have a babysitting gig where they can sign. \n\n\nShe's under no obligation to like your husband or stepdaughter. Forcing her to interact with people for this long has only made her resent you too. She'll be gone in a year and is counting the days until then. \n\nYTA", "So many YTAs?! At most this is a ESH, but I honestly feel like NTA. Worse thing OP did was allow her to babysit, which I\u2019m sure will no longer be happening. But, how is the daughter exempt from being the AH for her actions..? She\u2019s holding a 14-year long grudge and expects OP to never re-marry and continue to find another life partner? She made her choice to ignore OP\u2019s husband and daughter, fine. She\u2019s allowed to have feelings about it. But the reality is- she\u2019s creating a mentally unhealthy/unsupportive living situation for the deaf daughter. The consequence of that is she will live in dorms (she won\u2019t even have to pay for it!) if she continues this way. Stop acting like she\u2019s gonna be homeless. \n\nEven the husbands side makes sense! Of course he would bring up divorce if this is how it\u2019s going to be long-term. He\u2019s not even an AH in anyway to bring that up, he\u2019s just looking out for his own daughter. \n\nOP just needs to have a REAL talk to her daughter. Figure out what she\u2019s feeling and why. Put her in therapy. If she feels betrayed, she\u2019s going to have to work through that. Because at the end of it it\u2019s not fair to expect OP to not move on.", "NTA you are offering to pay for her dorm! Saying that everyone in the household should have a basic grasp of how to communicate with eachother is reasonable. You gave her a very reasoble choice woth two good options. \"Learn a skill that can also help you in the future as well as allow our entire household to communicate, or get free housing close to your college\" how can anyone call this an AH move? How spoilt can a person be?", "NTA. You are a mother, but also a human. You deserve love and happiness too. You didn't rush into anything, you've wait long enough and then some to be respectful to the memory of your first husband. You are still supporting your basically adult daughter, but also setting some reasonable personal boundaries.\n\nAll that said, while I don't think you are the asshole, I also don't think this is the smart decision to make. The ASL thing is a symptom of the much larger issue - - your daughter does not think it's OK for you to move on from her dead father, and she is taking those emotions out on your new husband and his daughter. It'd be one thing if it was just your new husband but obviously it's terrible and untenable to have the 7 year old be a victim of this too. The problem is, your plan is going to force exactly that! Your daughters resentment is going to focus on the 7 year old more than ever because she's the reason she can't live at home. And even if your daughter gives in, I think if your honest with yourself you'll realize that won't solve anything. Your daughter will speak a little sign langauge, but if she's still being cruel or unkind or resentful towards this child, your new husband will need to leave.\n\nInstead of the ASL ultimatum, I'd say offer a different one. Family therapy for you and your daughter (just you two, at least for now). Nothing will change until your daughter gets past her frozen grief of whatever other blocker she has that makes her think you are betraying her and her father by being in a relationship at all. Once she agrees that you deserve a new relationship, everything else will fall into place over time.", "NTA. I would tell her she can either learn ASL and live at home or figure out how to pay for a dorm or shared accommodate by working part time. In any case, knowing ASL could be an asset to her in the future.", "NTA. If you were asking your daughter to learn the entirety of sign language, you would be. Learning a new language is a big ask. But asking her to learn the basics is reasonable. Honestly, it would be reasonable even if she wasn\u2019t babysitting your stepdaughter. It would be ideal for everyone in the house to know at least a little sign language so your stepdaughter can be comfortable. And the ultimatum you put out there (stay at home and learn some ASL or move out which OP will pay for) seems completely reasonable especially considering that you would pay for her to live in a dorm. \n\nEven though you\u2019re NTA, I would like to ask you to consider taking your daughter to therapy. She obviously has some big feelings from her father\u2019s death and is uncomfortable with her stepdad and stepsister living with her.", "Going against the grain here and saying NTA, even though it\u2019s hard for me to say that because it implies that a minor child of 17 is an AH. At this point, being a minor, it\u2019s unfair for adults to label her in any manner other than \u201cneeding help\u201d. Get her help. However, her need for help shouldn\u2019t impede your need for a partner and definitely shouldn\u2019t expose a vulnerable child with a disability to potential abuse or harm. All the blah blah blah and therapizing here is too much. Whatever your daughter is struggling with is valid to her, however, our struggles never excuse cruelty to others. Make no mistake, either: cruelty to a disabled child is cruelty to their parent as well. Your husband\u2019s consideration of leaving is 100% self-preservation and protection of his child, which has to be his number one priority.  \n\nIf you found through objective analysis that your daughter\u2019s struggle is pathologically severe enough that it means that your living situation is harmful to her, then your priority should be to protect her similarly.

It shows how people view those with disabilities as not worthy of equality and accommodations, even in their own home. \n\nAs an aside, I would encourage you to discuss therapy with your daughter. And, maybe you could go for family sessions, too (you and her). I know you can\u2019t make her go, but it seems that she is struggling and could use the support of an outside and unbiased source. Her anger could be related to unresolved and misdirected grief/trauma. Good luck.", "NTA. Everyone here saying you are needs a bit of a reality check. Reading the post and comments I have from OP, here is the reality of what is here.\n\nThe daughter wasn't and still isn't forced to learn ASL.\n\nThe daughter wasn't forced to be a babysitter for the 7 year old deaf girl. She was given first rights to the job and took it for extra cash.\n\nThe daughter has pretty much a whole floor of the house for herself. She isn't even forced to share her space with a 7 year old. She can and clearly does remove herself from the situation.\n\nBoth parents seem to have acknowledged that the girl has no responsibility to step family from the looks of it.\n\nHer mom and Step-dad have been amazingly accomodating to the elder kid. They have encouraged but never forced interaction and learning ASL. They have put in the effort to encourage, and not force. Why are they STILL the bad guys for wanting to be together?\n\nThe daughter, on the other hand, has chosen not to try to be a part of the family, to be barely nice, act cold and standoffish to a 7 year old, be franky disgusting by telling her mom it's not her fault she chose a disabled kid's dad when asked to try and learn ASL for the job she took babysitting the deaf child.\n\nConmenters are letting this 17 year old get passes she frankly doesn't deserve. She refuses to learn ASL, so she should lose the source of income for sure. End of story, actions have consequences. She refuses to get the basic skills for the job, so be it she loses it.\n\nThe husband is rightly tired of seeing his 7 year old get the cold shoulder in her own home and has made the effort to not force this 17 year old to do anything up until this point. But it is having an effect on his kid, and he's vocalized how big of a problem this is.\n\nThe 17 year old is about to turn 18, and her mom has offered two paths for college. Stay home, but she needs to start making an actual effort to make the house comfortable to everyone in it, or she can live at the dorm. Basically, act like an adult and stop acting like these people are home invaders in their own home or leave because both parents share the cost of the house meaning it's BOTH theirs not the soon to be an adult's house.\n\nMom is willing to pay for her daughter in either case, which her daughter should be grateful for since not all 18 year olds have that option. Most parents would have kicked the kid out for being an AH to the rest of the house.\n\nThe daughter isn't being given an ultimatum she is being given a choice. Either way, she is paid for, so no added stress of bills or being kicked out to fend for herself.\n\nThe choice is simple, stop acting like an asshole, or get her own space outside the house so that everyone can be comfortable.\n\nMy sister is 8 years older than me. She is my biological sister. Due to reasons, my mom and dad split up before she was born and remarried when she was 7. So my sister and dad barely knew each other (Army sucks for families) before our parents got remarried. While she acknowledges our dad as her dad, she has frankly treated him like a stepdad most of her life, and me a half sibling at best.\n\nMy sister was given the same allowances this 17 year old was given with her step sister. I'm not deaf, but I am mentally disabled. She was never forced to watch me, she was paid for it ect.\n\nWhen she was about to start high school, my parents had had enough of her treatment of me. They set her down with my Grandparents (whom she adored and adored her) and gave her a choice. She could stay with us, but she had to stop treating me like a problem, stop actively being cold towards me, stop taking my toys apart, and make an effort to be a part of our family. Or she needed to go live with her grandparents because it wasn't fair to me that she was making my life a living hell as revenge for mom remarrying our dad.\n\nMy sister chose to live with our grandparents. She would rather live with them than make an effort to see me as a person who had a right to not be treated like a lesser person in her own home for being 'not part of her family'.\n\nThis 17 year old is basically getting the same choice my sister got, except the 17 year old seems to want option 3 to continue to stay at home and make life miserable for a 7 year old. And people back this? Why? She literally has no more right to be in the family house than the 7 year old.\n\nActions have consequences. She wants to be an ass and cause emotional distress to a 7 year old, fine, she can live at the dorm. Either way, her mom isn't abandoning her to the wolves. Sne will still cover the dorm, the daughter will I am sure still be allowed to visit and see her mom, she just isn't allowed to ruin a disabled 7 year old's life.", "I\u2019m going to divorce you because your kid is being abusive to mine who also has a disability.

In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication.\n\nCounterpoint - there are other ways to communicate beyond ASL, but also you could have just hired a babysitter that knows ASL if that's a key point for you.

She's not responsible for your choice, and she shouldn't be forced to learn another language because of the decisions you've made.  And again - if knowing ASL is the requirement to *babysit*, then you should hire a babysitter who knows ASL - not force your daughter into it.\n\n>This issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all.\n\nYour husband should have considered this prior to getting married, honestly.  I strongly doubt your daughter was extremely outgoing and affectionate pre-marriage and then pulled a 180 to \"bare minimum interaction\".  Also - have either of you tried actually explaining to the 7YO \"She's not super engaging with you, some people are like that\"?  Like... the only way it's going to be super damaging is if someone is feeding this notion that everyone will be happy and holding hands and her bestest friends to her, and then leaving her to deal with the reality that not everyone is going to like you.\n\n>He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nOr, you know, hire a different babysitter who knows ASL and explain to 7YO that not everyone is going to want to be friends with her, and that's ok.\n\n>So given all that, I had to finally put my foot down.\n\n\"My marriage is what matters, not my daughter having agency or teaching my stepdaughter an important life lesson\"\n\n>I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL.\n\n\"I am making you responsible for my decisions, because my husband is mad that you aren't being part of the picture-perfect family he wants\"\n\n>She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency.\n\nThere are other ways to communicate beyond ASL.  Is 7YO illiterate as well?  Also, forcing someone to communicate with her because \"it's basic decency\" is just outright shitty - you're just circling back to trying to force a relationship that isn't there, which *I thought* we established you understood was a not a thing you should do.\n\n>I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\n\"If you aren't willing to keep giving in to what I want you to do, you can't be here.

Blended families are hard in the best of circumstances.  But trying to force your daughter to put in the time and effort to learn a language just to keep your husband happy (because let's be honest - that's what this is) is shitty and just showing her exactly how far down she is on your priorities.  *She* isn't trying to damage your relationship or be hostile to anyone else.  *Your husband* is fully aware that you forcing her to do this will damage your relationship with her, and that you will blame her for that damage.  *You* are willing to sacrifice your relationship with your child to keep him happy.\n\nNeither kid is an asshole - your teenager just wants to be left alone, and your stepdaughter is caught in the crossfire of two adults who refuse to let the teenager just exist instead of playing happy family.", "INFO where is your daughter's father in her life?

If you were my mother I would take this as you choosing your new family over me. You\u2019re telling your daughter she will lose her housing if she doesn\u2019t do what you want for your step daughter, someone she has no obligation to. Your marrying the girls father does not mean your daughter suddenly has a responsibility. You have a responsibility as a mother. But you are clearly making a choice. And your daughter will make hers. In the future you\u2019re be writing a post asking why your daughter refuses to speak to you.", "> It is not an ultimatum, but a legitimate concern of a parent.\n\n>As a single father his main responsibility is to provide a safe (physically, financially and emotionally) for his kid.\n\nSo he 'hired' a babysitter that can't communicate with his child and doesn't want to.", "Having a 5 minute conversation with a one-time adult customer is completely different from regularly watching a child for multiple hours a day, assumedly multiple times a week.  In fact, most Deaf/HoH people strongly prefer an interpreter whenever possible when receiving services because so much is lost in translation when writing.  Plus it can be frustrating and difficult for them as ASL and English have completely different grammar rules and sentence structures.  ASL is not a direct translation of English.\n\nThe younger daughter is likely not fluent in English yet at her age, especially if she was born Deaf/HoH or if it happened before she was regularly speaking. If they had to write to communicate, OP would be giving the 7-year-old the \"homework she doesn't want\" if she has to learn how to write in English to just communicate her needs with her babysitter. I think it makes more sense to require the almost-adult woman who is getting paid to start learning basic ASL.  Or hire a new ASL-fluent babysitter and require the older daughter to learn to have some common courtesy for a child who is also going through a rough transition or go live in a college dorm.", "You say that as though 17 is too young to know that being a jerk to a small child is wrong. God forbid a teenager be culpable for their own actions on this sub", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair to expect someone to learn another language when they clearly don\u2019t want to communicate with their step sibling. What if she wasn\u2019t deaf, and the OOPs daughter just ignored her? Would the outcome be the same?", "i thought mom just wanted the teen to learn certain words at least?\n\nlike Fire Alarm. Not Safe. Stranger Danger. Are you okay? Whatever. or learn to understand the signs for \"in pain\", \"hurt\", \"help\". what if the 7 year old is injured non-visually (appendicitis or something) and tried to communicate that with the teen? But can't, because teen refuses to learn even the sign for \"pain\" or \"emergency\"?\n\nTo me OP seemed to only want want the teen to learn enough ASL for *safety* sake. \n\ni think it's extremely ableist to refuse to learn even basic signs to communicate with a deaf person in your home. Even if you do not like them and their father. \n\nThere is no way the 7 year old did so much harm to the teen, personally, that the teen should be punishing the 7 year old with being a refusal of communication even in an emergency! Come on. \n\nA teenager is old enough to understand if there is an emergency some basic communication ability can be a life or death thing, or nearly."]}
