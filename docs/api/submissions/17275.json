{"id": 17275, "submission_id": "13i427k", "title": "AITA for forcing my daughter to learn sign language?", "selftext": "I (49 F) recently married my husband (52M) who has a deaf 7 year old daughter. She communicates solely via ASL. \n\nFor some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn\u2019t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn\u2019t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn\u2019t happen and as long as she\u2019s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can\u2019t exactly punish her for not liking them.\n\nNow, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her. \n\nHowever, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren\u2019t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she\u2019s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.\n\nThis issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nSo given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\nWell, my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684145717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i427k/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_learn_sign/", "score": 2503, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of talking and asking your daughter how she feels, or consider a different babysitter he pulls out the nuclear option to your relationship. \n\nYou are TA because you throw you daughter under the bus for marriage's sake and threaten to kick her out instead of being a mother and trying to understand her and offer her a bail out aka a different babysitter", "INFO: why is the daughter watching SD?

You can't make your daughter learn it, but you can take away things that you could only trust her with if she could.\n\nI won't pretend that your daughter isn't being unbelievably selfish and bratty. However, as an estranged adult child, I cannot help but feel that there's not enough asking of why here. I do not know for sure, but considering your daughter's age, I cannot rule out that she's scared that your stepdaughter will replace her in your heart. Is this rational? No, but it's worth remembering that you were her only adult in the world for the best part of 15 years, and just as she is about to reach the milestone of becoming an adult, a new man comes into your life with a child ten years her junior who needs more care than she did.\n\nI think you need to talk to your daughter away from the steps about this. Explain to her that marrying your new husband or being a good mother figure for your stepdaughter doesn't replace her father or her. Make sure she feels, not just knows, that she is seen and supported, it's just that stepdaughter needs extra care because she's deaf and because she's younger and in a less independent stage of her life.\n\nBy all means, encourage her to fly the nest, even if just temporarily, but remember this.\n\n\"It is not enough to love the young, but make sure they feel loved.\"\nJohn Bosco\n\nETA: for clarity, I don't think stepdaughter has a horse in the asshole race because she probably doesn't entirely understand what's going on here, due to age and daughter refusing to learn how to communicate with her.\n\nAs for the husband threatening divorce over this... I feel mixed because on the one hand, punishing OP for the behaviour of her daughter sucks, but I would expect him, given his circumstances, to put his child above a spouse.", "YTA for having your daughter babysit when she won't learn ASL. That's ridiculous; find someone else.\n\nI think you need to realise that, from your daughter's perspective, this relationship is still relatively new and as a near-adult she is less likely to see your stepdaughter as her stepsister. To her, you're changing the agreement re her living at home for college. I don't think you're wrong re ASL; tbh it's a good to to learn irrespective of living with someone who communicates this way.

I also think she sucks for taking it out on a child.\n\nI wouldn't call you an asshole for saying your daughter needs to learn or find some other way to make money, she should absolutely not be babysitting this child if she refuses to learn to communicate. You are an asshole if you make it a requirement for living in her own home, she didn't choose this. I feel sorry for your SD in this situation, and I find it a little appalling that you would leave her in the care of a teenager that demonstrably dislikes her to that extent, but I think you need to work on your own relationship with your daughter before trying to facilitate theirs.

Your daughter didn't. The girls aren't siblings, they are housemates with nothing in common so stop assuming a relationship that doesn't exist.  You risk your relationship with your child here with the ultimatums  being thrown around.", "I wanted to say you're TA until I read the end of your post. It's a more than acceptable agrrement that you offer to pay for her collage dorm if she doesn't want to learn ASL.\n\nMore of my opinion: I think you have no right to force her to learn ASL. I think you were irresponsible to leave a deft child with someone who is unable to communicate with her. But the fact that you are willing to pay her accommodation even when she is an adult is very kind of you.\n\n(For context: in my country you have to earn extremely hight points throughout your studies to get a scholarship to study law and there are 5 scholarship places for 100 students. I earned a scholarship which meant that I don't have to pay for university and I earned following scholarships with my high grades and activities that meant I got money from university/government and I paid for my dorm, food, hobbies and other activities. When I moved together with my boyfriend I started to work to be able to pay for a flat (which required mor money than a dorm) and mainwhile kept my grades high to get scholarships. And I wasn't even cold with neither my stepdad or with my half sister just realised that I'm a freaking adult who should handle her own shit...)\n\nSo no you are NTA", "NTA-you have an extremely self-centered daughter. Now, what I would do now, I\u2019d go back into my own child-rearing decisions and try to figure out what I did to make her lack empathy and believe the world revolves around her. It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s just teenage self-centered-ness, but it\u2019s also possible that she\u2019s a narcissist. \n\nAnd she should go to that dorm no matter what. She\u2019ll probably grow up a lot faster that way, which is good for her, and it will help the household dynamics.\n\nTherapy is probably in order here.", "NTA. It\u2019s really not much to ask for someone to take 5 mins a day to learn to communicate with someone they live with and get paid to care for. That said, your daughter is obviously struggling with this new relationship and family counseling would probs be a good idea because this matter isn\u2019t going to resolve itself. \nAdditional suggestion: make learning ASL more appealing to your daughter in general. Knowing how to sign is a huge benefit when looking for future jobs and she can put on her resume that she can sign and cared for a child who is deaf which will look good when applying for her major in university. Try to make this sound like more of an opportunity than a chore and maybe she\u2019ll respond better to learning ASL.", "Nta, your daughter doesn\u2019t have to like the new family but it shows a complete lack of respect and decency on her behalf that she\u2019s happy to take your money to watch your step daughter but then throws it in your face saying it\u2019s not her problem. In that instance it is 100% her problem as she is looking after her.\n\nYou did the right thing by saying she needs to stay somewhere else if she doesn\u2019t like it. Definitely stop getting her to watch SD though as she clearly doesn\u2019t care if anything happens to her.", "I am going to be clearly biased . Not only do I think she should learn some ASL, but l honestly think the family would benefit greatly from some therapy.  She IS responsible for being involved in the life of her family while she lives at home with you. \nShe has a stepsister now. She needs to learn enough ASL to be able to provide help to her sister if she needs it. \n   I truly believe you should not pay for her dorm room. If she wants to leave to go to college and does not want to live at home that is fine but why should you pay for that privilege especially if she rejects and is disrespectful to her sister?\n     Do please consider family therapy. It cannot hurt and it really could help.", "NTA - your daughter clearly has issues with audism and needs to be taught a lesson on how to appropriately interact with Deaf folks. I\u2019m sorry she hates her step family but if she is going to be living with someone who uses a different language than her then she needs to learn how to use that language. I would be saying the same thing if it were a spoken language.", "Your daughter should be going to the dorm no matter what. All of you will benefit from her no longer having to interact with people she has been very clear she has no interest in, especially your SD who likely has been internalizing this very negative response as something she caused. That\u2019s not a healthy environment and your husband is right to be concerned and considering ways to remove his child from it. So your daughter moves as is appropriate for this next stage in life and in no way a punishment. \n\nBut you should also look into individual and parental-child therapy sessions because her level of disdain and lack of empathy is very concerning. You cannot force her to like the new family members, but you can help her more positively process her emotions. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for trying to find solutions to this situation, but you are TA for ever attempting to leave your SD alone with your daughter when you know how negatively she feels and acts towards SD. That should never have been an option because it\u2019s too detrimental to SD\u2019s well-being. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to also get some sessions for SD with an ASL-speaking therapist to make sure you haven\u2019t allowed your daughter to cause any lasting damage already.", "It\u2019s unfortunate that this is the hill your daughter has chosen to die on. But not really surprising as it\u2019s the one that is getting her the attention she is wanting. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s basic safety and decency to be able to communicate with others.

You're offering to pay for her accommodation as an alternative so she won't end up homeless or any worse off financially. It's completely reasonable to expect her to have basic manners if she wants to continue living in your house as an adult.\n\nAnd to everyone saying that it's 'not that bad' for the 7 YO to live in a house where someone actively refuses to learn to communicate with you - can you seriously not imagine how isolating and upsetting it would be for a literal child to to have one member of their household refuse to EVER speak to them? I truly am taken aback by the callousness of some Redditors...", "NTA.\n\nYou've done the responsible thing in not forcing a relationship where none was desired but if your daughter is going to remain at home beyond what you're required to provide her as a minor, and also choose to watch SD for money she needs to learn ASL.

She communicates solely via ASL. \n\nFor some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn\u2019t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn\u2019t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn\u2019t happen and as long as she\u2019s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can\u2019t exactly punish her for not liking them.\n\nNow, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her. \n\nHowever, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren\u2019t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she\u2019s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.\n\nThis issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he\u2019s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this. \n\nSo given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn\u2019t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it\u2019s just that living in our house (that is also my SD\u2019s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.\n\nWell, my daughter hasn\u2019t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Imagine if you acted the same way when you found out he had a daughter with a hearing impairment!)\n\nI\u2019d be looking very hard at the kind of person she\u2019s becoming as an adult and certainly wouldn\u2019t allow her to destroy my marriage because of her cruel and insensitive demeanor.", "NTA you\u2019re really asking for some bare minimum effort on your daughter\u2019s side. She\u2019s almost 18, not 10. Your alternative to pay for her dorm is very generous - you\u2019re not kicking her out on the streets or abandoning her. It\u2019s ok that your daughter is angry, she\u2019s allowed to feel emotions, it\u2019s not ok for her to take it out on her 7 year old step sister. \n\nEveryone on here is talking about you ruining your relationship with your daughter by \u201ckicking her out\u201d but i think your request is reasonable, and that if anything, your daughter is the one damaging the relationship between you two.

Regardless of the babysitting situation, your daughter needs to make an effort to communicate with her step sister - if she doesn\u2019t want to learn ASL, then they should write to each other if that\u2019s an option. But the heart of the matter is that your daughter is being unkind to her step sister and you\u2019re trying to find a solution.

It was very lonely, I did not like how bratty I was being and it took a lot of effort to keep up. But I was so intensely unhappy it was the only method I had to convey that.

Nobody is forcing her to do a thing Chief, she's less than a year away from being an adult anyways.\n\nAsking her to learn 10~ signs if she wants to live at home otherwise I'll PAY FOR you to live elsewhere isn't \"forcing\" and especially not when the \"child\" is 17.", "Living with people you dislike is not abuse, actually.", "Y\u2019all are wild lmao.", "To be fair, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around the younger girl either. Not everyone will go the extra step to accommodate her.", "Learn a whole language to interact with someone I\u2019m forcing you to care about, this is the only way you can still stay at your home that you\u2019ve been at for longer", "I think she\u2019s objecting to feeling like she\u2019s being pushed out of her home. Even if she wants to go away to college, the \u201cok I\u2019ll pay for it but you\u2019re leaving\u201d position of her mother is very harsh. But the daughter has chosen to focus her resistance on a very vulnerable person, so it\u2019s hard to see how she could be allowed to stay.\n\nLike many of these situations, the problem started a lot further back, with her mother moving forward with her new relationship while her daughter was left so far out of things. And it\u2019s clear that the \u201cpaid babysitting\u201d wasn\u2019t voluntary, or a good idea since the daughter can\u2019t communicate with the stepdaughter, so that\u2019s another example of the mother forging ahead and requiring her daughter to fall in line. It sounds a lot like the \u201cmust learn to communicate\u201d and \u201cwill not\u201d battle lines are related to the babysitting; daughter figures she can\u2019t be made to babysit if she won\u2019t learn to communicate, and the mother isn\u2019t having that.", "No... thays so conditional... you only love your kid if they learn for soemoen else they're not even related too? Mom decided to be involved with this guy.... daughter did not. Shes ALLOWED to not like someone", "I always paid my daughter when she watched her younger brothers during the summer, didn\u2019t mean she had a choice in the matter.", "When I was a teen I was often \u201casked\u201d to do things including some that were really not appropriate and I would get screamed at for not having the capability of an adult. \n\nYes I was paid but that was just a means of making it so I couldn\u2019t complain - some people treat paying you as \u201cI\u2019ve paid you therefore can treat you any way I want\u201d.\nThese days you could offer me any amount of money, and the answer would be no, cause that parent can no longer coercively control me.", "You think she was getting what an ASL fluent sitter would?", "She is getting paid to babysit though...if she was forced then she wouldn't be getting paid for it", "It's the internet, aren't we supposed to speculate?", "I am not divorced. But I have many friends family member divorced or lost their partner in life. Shot happens. And is unreasonable to forbid those people to get another chance. I will understand if there is abuse or really unreasonable expectation of love and relationships, but be civil and allow your parents to have a future and a life is extremely selfish. Treating a little girl like a pariah just because you can\u2019t accept your mother remarried is extremely petty and AH behavior. There is no excuse. The mother has been widow for 15 years, daughter is on the verge of adulthood.", "Then it\u2019s her choice, god knows I will be happy to have my kids home. But again they can\u2019t become dictators of my own life as I can\u2019t dictate their life. Rules, compromises sure. Little dictators on my $, hell no. Or I ll will make it my mission to move in with them in adulthood and disapprove boot put any future partner just because.", "Right? It's not even fluency to hold a conversation with anybody...it's specifically enough to communicate with a seven year old. That's gonna be some pretty basic signs and a few specific interests. \n\nI can't imagine living with a child who probably feels isolated enough in a hearing world already and having a sibling that won't even make an attempt to talk to you. \n\nIf the teen really wanted to pull a petty power move, she would learn sign language and use that to be an obnoxious older teenage sibling. Figure out what the sign is for an exasperated sigh and saying \"muuuuuh-aomm!\" with the particular cadence of youth.", "Luckily craig could put up with me, he was so nice and would give me money for takeout if he was taking my mom out for dinner and asked how school was and sports. He took care of my brothers and treated all of us like his partners children because he knew we all had a dad and we didn\u2019t want a \u201cnew\u201d dad. I\u2019m glad he was able to put up with my meanness and they\u2019re still together now and we laugh about it", "Where does it say she barely knew him before moving in? What\u2019s the appropriate time to know someone before moving in together? What if she knows him and just doesn\u2019t like him?", "My step dad moved in with my mom and myself when I was 15. I hated it, I knew of him, I met him many times but didnt \"know him\" and I just hated him in my house and was super fucking rude. I'm in my 30s now and we have a great relationship, teens have a hard time with their emotions and parents shouldn't suffer for it.", "Then what if both partners bought the house, like equally contributed to the sale the what now?", "I'm a male", "ITT: TIL that having a blended family is basically child abuse, actually", "\"everyone\" is not sharing a house with her. she's seven.", "You have a point. However, I think society at large agrees that ethically speaking, it is highly rewarding if people accommodate others. But I guess the 7 year old is getting a real good taste of reality that people aren\u2019t always this way.", "She literally just asked her to learn a couple signs. She never told her to learn a whole new language lol wtf\n\nSorry but giving two options isn't \"forcing\" her to do anything and even if she were, we're talking about maybe 10-20 signs at most. Idk if you're aware but there are thousands of signs, 10 doesn't equate to a \"whole language\" that's a massive exaggeration.\n\nBut even if that were the case, she gave her the option to live at a dorm fully paid. Sorry but what kind of privileged upbringing did you have where in your view that's being \"forced\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah if you live w someone who is deaf I\u2019m trying to understand the logic for not learning \u201chelp\u201d \u201churt\u201d \u201cyes\u201d \u201cno\u201d etc?  \n\nThe op says daughter knows no words at. What is the rational for not learning at least help and yes and no?", "Exactly, OP's daughter will quickly change her mind about living at home for college.", "Her and the husband paid equally for the home they\u2019re in so I doubt OPs daughter has lived there longer. She is accepting payment to watch the 7 y/o but refuses to learn basic signs in case there is something wrong and the 7 y/o needs to communicate that to her", "Yes that's right. It's Step daughters home now too.", "She's not forcing her to become fluent. Just to learn basic words. That isn't a huge ask, ESPECIALLY when living with a deaf child. Frankly, she shouldn't have been allowed to watch the girl without knowing some basic communication. That's just dangerous.", "No one should have to force you to care about the basic safety of a child in your household. I think people get quite wrapped up in the idea of \u2018who is responsible for a child\u2019 and suggest that this responsibility lies solely with the biological parents but this is a horrible way to look at things. \n\nNeither the 17 year old or the younger child chose this situation but it is the situation they are in. Regardless of her relationship with her mum or her mum\u2019s partner the 17 year old has a de facto relationship with the child. She is saying through her actions that she will not make minimal effort to help keep the child safe. That\u2019s unconscionable and it *is* ableist.", "She isn\u2019t forcing her to care about the child- daughter should know how to communicate with her step sister.", "She\u2019s allowed to not like someone but not allowed to be disrespectful to others by refusing to learn how to accommodate. Learning ASL is not complicated. Some basic signs go a long way. The 17 year old is being more unreasonable than anyone else.", "Nobody said she didn't love her daughter though, she's even willing to pay for her dorm. But the thing is, when you get married to someone with kids, part of your responsibility is loving your step child just as much as you would one of your own children. Loving all your kids equally. And from OP and step daughters perspective, the daughter is quite literally ignoring the poor little girl's existence altogether. And from what this is saying the daughter didn't even give them a chance from the get go. Choosing to let the daughter stay and continue bullying the disabled daughter, will do nothing but enable the older one and risk causing the disabled one to end up with trauma.", "You can be forced to do something and still get some compensation", "Selfishness runs so deep that you can tell just from the downvotes on certain comments who can relate to the daughter\u2026", "Aw that\u2019s awesome, I\u2019m happy for you and your family.", "Towards the end of ops post they even say the house was paid for equally by them. It\u2019s doubtful it came to a HUGE surprise for the 17 year old as it would be an anomaly for a brand new couple to buy a house together. Is it possible, yes but we don\u2019t know that context unless op updates on the relationship timeline. I do believe it is every human\u2019s responsibility on earth to treat each other with decency and respect. 17 year old not even trying to communicate with a deaf 7 year old doesn\u2019t seem right. If they find their own way of communicating such as writing on paper etc I think that\u2019s okay but I also think 17 yr old needs to know certain signs for emergency situations regardless of if she is going to continue watching the kid because you should be able to know when someone in your home is in serious medical danger. I don\u2019t know asl so I\u2019m unsure what basic signs would be necessary to know but I do think 17 yr is definitely displacing their resentment for their families circumstances on a 7 year old.", "Don't do that in the first place? Why would you buy a house and move with your kids there if your kids barely know the other person? Who does that?", "This sub has the wildest takes I\u2019ve ever seen anywhere in the internet. I refuse to believe some of these users aren\u2019t bots.", "There is no logic. A bunch of the people responding to this topic sound like angsty 13 year olds but if they aren't they lived very privileged lives. There is no rationale aside from being a brat imo.", "Sorry daughter I only care about you as a babysitter, unless you learn a new language you will not be allowed to stay here because you aren\u2019t small, cute, and obey us like she is and does <3", "On top of it she was only asked to learn a couple signs in order to make the girls life easier. Not being able to communicate is really tough especially for a 7yr old.\n\nOPs daughter could learn 10-20 signs with very little effort at all. She's just being a brat imo. I can't believe how many people above us are on her side. On top of it they're totally misrepresenting what happened. Every person here is an AH aside from the 7yr old who is innocent.", "I noticed this too, it's infuriating. \nSo many young people that seam to think that parents should be punished for having a child against that child's wishes (the famous tiktok saying \"I didn't choose to be born\") and should bow to every whim of their child, not allowed to have a shred of happiness just because they became a parent and turns out life sucks and sometimes we can't give our children the life we planned/wished for.", "Or she could move out and be on her own which would be paid for by her mother. She\u2019s wants to have her cake and eat it too. What she doesn\u2019t get to do is make a bad environment for a 7 year old unnecessarily because she has issues with her mom moving on from her dad after 15 years. That completely uncalled for.", "The older daughter is being paid to babysit. Mom isn't asking her to become fluent, just to learn some basic communication tools so she can interact at a minimum level with her stepsister. It's no different than a decent human would do if they had to interact daily with a deaf person as part of their job or in their social circle.", "Wow. That is ridiculous.", "Seems more like daughter I will not allow you to mistreat a small child because you're mad, I will continue to care for your biggest life expense but will not allow you to mistreat a small child on what is also her home.", "Yes, ASL is easy enough to learn over a few dinner sessions \u2014 how are you, yes, no, happy, sad, help, bye, hi, etc. Anyone as busy as a 17 year old can accomplish this quickly in mere minutes per day.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think OP even explained why her daughter dislikes the stepfather and stepdaughter. This is the real root cause of this drama.", "And if you mention that \u2018no contact\u2019, \u2018low contact\u2019 goes both ways the howling begins about how fucked you not only are as a parent, but that your kid hates you for a reason. Not accounting for the fact that plenty of decent people work extremely hard to raise a child and they just turn out to be an asshole. Period."]}
