I've been doing the painting upstairs and sometimes spill a bit and when I do I try to clean it up as fast as possible. The linen closet is upstairs so I just run to that and grab out a few towels and don't really pay attention to what I'm grabbing as long as it can wipe paint up.\n\nMy wife is kind of crazy when it comes to towels lol. She's got different ones for different uses, hair, hands, face, body, decorative, general cleaning, even old ones that are paint and grease covered but been washed, etc... so she gets upset that I use whichever towels to clean paint spills instead of the ones she has dedicated to stuff like this. \n\nHer complaint is, some of the towels I use are kind of pricey and have a certain purpose and I'm ruining them by using them to wipe up paint. And some she only has limited quantities of. I say, towels are towels, they're all basically the same and are replaceable, so she can use the joint account and buy more of her towels because I'm not going to waste time looking for specific towels when there's paint on the floor I need to clean up. \n\nWife says I'm the ah for not respecting her stuff. I say I'm not the ah and she's being a bit silly over nothing.

The linen closet is upstairs so I just rum to that and grab out a few towels and don't really pay attention to what I'm grabbing as long as it can wipe paint up.\n\nMy wife is kind of crazy when it comes to towels lol. She's got different ones for different uses, hair, hands, face, body, decorative, general cleaning, even old ones that are paint and grease covered but been washed, etc... so she gets upset that I use whichever towels to clean paint spills instead of the ones she has dedicated to stuff like this. \n\nHer complaint is, some of the towels I use are kind of pricey and have a certain purpose and I'm ruining them by using them to wipe up paint. And some she only has limited quantities of. I say, towels are towels, they're all basically the same and are replaceable, so she can use the joint account and buy more of her towels because I'm not going to waste time looking for specific towels when there's paint on the floor I need to clean up. \n\nWife says I'm the ah for not respecting her stuff. I say I'm not the ah and she's being a bit silly over nothing. What say you, reddit?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
