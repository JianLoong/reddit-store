What, you own the street now? What impact did this have on you?", "NAH. But if they were in a public space who really cares. If they like to be out in that stuff they can go for it.", "YTA. You embarrassed them. What they were doing had no impact on your life.", "Soft YTA. Don\u2019t you remember how fun it was to make out with your bf/gf when you were young?  I think the whole \u201cdidn\u2019t want them to get wet in the rain\u201d is BS. I would have felt humiliated at that age and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re remembering how sensitive teenagers can be.", "YTA, they weren\u2019t hurting you, and I doubt they thought you were cool, think back to when you were that age", "YTA. Unless they were on your property it was not your place to say anything to them. You must have found some nice ones. Most teens would have told you to go fuk yourself.

What is boo-ed?", "NTA\n\nThat sounds adorable \nAnd I bet she appreciates the suggestion of cocoa (I would have).\n\nIf they prefer to canoodle in the rain, they can walk the loooooong way to the cafe.", "Okay, when I read the question without reading the context you added, I did think you were the AH. But after reading how you said it to them, it seems lighthearted and even a little funny. NTA", "NTA- I think that's kinda cute?", "True. From their uniforms, I determined they were high schoolers. If they were adults or the weekend, I would have ignored them.", "Yep. NAH at worst.", "True. No impact except I wanted them to be warm and dry and maybe not cross paths with a truancy officer. I'm totally cool with being in love and skipping school.", "They were in front of his house so yea..", "I tried to make a joke/be lighthearted so they would feel less embarrassed or scolded. Mostly just wanted dude to be more mindful and take the girl out of the rain. The were 20 steps away from a tunnel/overpass. 10 mins walking from the library.", "Exactly this. Like mind your own fucking business man. YTA", "You are getting old OP, this is how I start to think these days lol", "You're pretty sexist too. What, because she's a girl, she doesn't have the sense or agency to get out of the rain? She needs the guy to do it for her? Gross.", "le sigh.

I totally would have laughed and asked to go to the library after that, you\u2019ve got a great point! Us young folk don\u2019t need to be out in public all the time.", "NTA.\n\nOf all the things I've heard of people saying to teen couples, although mildly embarrassing (as most things at that age are) this was actually pretty cute and funny. Not to mention you weren't pulling a *hey , you kid! get off my lawn!* just saying they should get out of the rain and  that he should be chivalrous. They probably even had a laugh about it later.", ">I think I was being cool/lighthearted while encouraging them not to get sick from standing in the drizzle.\n\n\nHonestly, you did. You weren't telling them \"hey get lost with that lovey lovey crap\" you were telling them it would be better to be out of the cold rain\n\nNTA", "It seems like a lot of the roommates/friends/family in AITA basically think anyone who says anything to anyone is out of bounds.", "This is my boo, my girl, evolved into being boo\u2019ed up, having a girlfriend", "> le sigh\n\nStill using this is the primary indicator of age."]}
