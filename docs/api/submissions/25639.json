I have no red flags when it comes to him and our relationship. We are the textbook definition of a perfect couple. \n\nHe has one sibling which is his younger sister (19). The first day i met his sister , she was uninterested in getting to know me. Our first meeting all three of us went out to eat . My boyfriend always holds the car door for me when he is driving. This time though as he was holding the door for me , his sister got into the front . Which obviously isn\u2019t a big deal , but it was the first instances of many when i felt she was being snarky. \n\nAnother day , me and my boyfriend decided to bring his sister with us to the beach . ( this time i sat in front before she could get to the car ) The whole time while we are at the beach , she\u2019s trying to hold his hand at the same time as me. She would touch his chest and look into his eyes. It got to a point where some one asked us if we all was in a poly relationship! \n\nIve been trying to hold my cool about it since everyone tells me that\u2019s \u201csibling love\u201d even though i definitely don\u2019t act like that with my siblings. But this past weekend? I\u2019ve had enough. I stayed at my boyfriends house for a few days just to spend some time with him. Obviously while i\u2019m there he\u2019s spending time with me and not his family . As me and him was sleeping , his sister called him 27 times, texted 51 times and left 4 voicemails . The texts and voicemails consisted of her yelling at him for not spending enough time with her because of me .\n\nI eventually was over it & woke my boyfriend up to tell him about his sisters weird behavior . He proceeds to tell me i\u2019m not the first girl he\u2019s been with to say that , but he still doesn\u2019t believe the way she acts is a little inappropriate for a brother and sister relationship. Me and my boyfriend are now in our first big fight and i haven\u2019t seen him in over two weeks .

It looks like your boyfriend already has a girlfriend.", "No. NTA. That is weird.  And to be honest, this issue should be a deal breaker.  If he doesn't see the problem then he's going to continue to allow it.  And as long as he allows it, it will continue. There is nothing you can do but decide if you want this as part of your life.  It doesn't sound like you do want this as part of your life.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's not the one.", "NTA\n\nHis sister needs psychiatric help. 27 calls 51 txts and 4 voicemails, holding his hand at beach when he is holding yours\n\nYour bf also needs psychiatric help if he cannot honestly agree that there is something wrong with his sister's behavior,  (27 calls 51 txts 4 voicemails, holding his hand at beach when he is holding yours etc).  Plus, prior GFs have said the same thing, and now a random couple asked if you 3 were a poly relationship.  So be clear with him, that thats quite a number.of people who have observed the  strangeness of their relationship.\n\nMost sisters dont call their brothers 27 times in a year, much less a few hrs\n\n\nIf he will not agree there is an issue and agree to reasonable boundaries, then i think your only hope for the relationship  is if you can convince him to accompany you to counseling so a professional can open his eyes.\n\nIf he is unwilling to do either of those things, i dont know why you would want to go forward with him.   Because ewwww. What you described  at best is an enmeshed co-dependent relationship or at worst emotional and/or sexual incest.\n\nYou would never have peace in the relationship as long as his sister behaves that way and as long as he allows it.  It is not your problem to fix and if he isnt not just willing, but happy & enthusiastic to put boundaries in place w his sister it is not worth your effort. \n\nYou didnt say whether he behaves the same way towards her.  If he calls and txts her the amount she does with him, its prob not even worth your effort to talk w him about it, because he is just as weird w her as she is with him.  In that case,.let them have whatever they have with each other and move on.", "NTA, that's some seriously strange stuff.", "I didn\u2019t even have to read the whole thing I got to the holding hands part and immediately got the ick. Unless she\u2019s a child there\u2019s no reason for her to want to hold her brothers hand \ud83d\udc80 NTA wake up break up and maybe warn future gfs of this and his weirdo behavior \ud83e\udd72", "NTA\n\nThe problem isn't his sister's behavior, although that is certainly very strange as you describe it.  (I'm also inclined to believe you since he admitted he had other GF's who have said the same.) The problem is that *he* doesn't see anything wrong with it.\n\nI'd guess his sister has succeeded in sabotaging yet another of his relationships, which is clearly her goal.", "NTA \n\nRUN! This is like incest creepy, he admits you aren\u2019t the first one to have an issue and pretty much has shown you it won\u2019t change. \n\nLet his sister have him!", "NTA.\n\nIt is definitely weird!\n\nIt could be she has attachment issues, is there anything weird about her relationship to her parents, or is she adopted or something?", "Yeah...this is a bit weird. Look, you can only express to your BF your discomfort and how you find his sister's behavior intrusive and inappropriate.  It really is up to him whether he wants to establish boundaries with his sister, but you don't have to stick around if he doesn't.  NTA.", "NTA, that doesn't sound normal for a sibling relationship. I would question that too", "You're definitely not the ah, and whether or not your boyfriend and his sister have a romantic relationship, she has an incredibly unhealthy emotional attachment to him. She's definitely trying to come between you and him and can't stand the idea of him being with you. So he definitely needs to deal with it. You're absolutely right for dealing with it and not just looking the other way. This is some really weird behavior.\n\nNTA", "definitely NTA. Your boyfriend needs to open his eyes. If his other ex girlfriends said the same, then that means something is going on and that he needs to stop basically defending his sister and have a serious conversation with her about her actions etcetera. If he doesn't understand, then there's no point with being with someone like him since his sister will probably be the cause of possible fights", "NTA - The red flags blot out the sun.  If he doesn\u2019t think this is a weird situation then I\u2019d cut my losses and leave him now.  Imagine the girl who marries him and has to put up with his sister FOREVER!", "NTA at all to question this behavior.  I can't say the \"why\" of it, but it is not normal.  If your BF ghosts you for asking about this, good riddance, I'd say.  You do NOT want to get involved seriously with someone who thinks this is the way it should be.  I'm close to my siblings but in no way was ever in competition with their GFs.", "NTA. \n\nYour BF\u2019s sister seems a little too comfortable being physical with him. Most grown siblings don\u2019t hug each other more than a few times a year, let alone hold hands (especially while also holding your GF\u2019s hand) and touch each other.
