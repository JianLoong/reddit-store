I wish I could figure it out but what I do know is everyone is a big ol\u2019 meanie to Sam and Mommy.\u201d \ud83d\ude43", "\u201c I want to call out all the family-shaming in this thread. There\u2019s lots of different ways to be a family, and that\u2019s not what this request for judgement is about.\u201d\n\nI think the concept and definition of family is different depending on the person. If someone considers blood their family, that\u2019s their business. Likewise if someone considers non-biologically related people their family, that\u2019s also their business. There isn\u2019t a wrong way to go about it. If there\u2019s conflict because two people disagree, then that\u2019s a problem. However, it doesn\u2019t mean one person is wrong for having their own beliefs/opinions as to what family is to them. \n\nThe only problem with family definitions and family shaming  is when someone shames, judges, or tries to correct someone else\u2019s view of what family is to them. \n\nYou can absolutely determine for yourself what family is to you, and no one has the right to try to change that so it fits what they like or believe in. \n\nThere\u2019s nuance to it; it all depends on the people and the situation. There\u2019s many ways to be family and they should all be respected. The thing in this situation with OP, is that he doesn\u2019t consider his mom\u2019s on and off life partner\u2019s children his family, and readers pick up on that and react accordingly. If OP had said he viewed them as siblings, comments would be different. Either way, OP has the right to consider, or not consider, those kids as his siblings, and it should be respected even if in this case his no ruffles mom\u2019s and mom\u2019s partner\u2019s feathers.", "I'm sure they like to do that to make you and others feel obligated to do whatever is they want.   \n\n\nHow he tries to twist this to make it seem like your biased as opposed to you legitimately don't want to is infuriating. (And I notice you're not getting paid to do it or being offered any kind of incentive to do it either.) You're allowed to say no and not give a reason. You keep holding those boundaries OP!", "thanks", "15 counting OP", "No, its 15 counting OP. 6 from mom and 6 from step dad separately and then 3 from them together... 6+6+3=15", "They are definitely not thinking about birth control", "They're NOT thinking. These people need to be issued some chastity belts or something because holy shit.", "Both of you killed me", "Whenever forced birth control is mentioned, it\u2019s always rebutted with eugenics. That\u2019s where it gets touchy.\n\nThe thing is, neither one of these people are doctors or lawyers. They\u2019re not independently wealthy. They\u2019re either living off public assistance and/or are living in some degree of poverty. Neither is good for society and neither is good for the upbringing of all 15 of those children. \n\nThe other issue being none of those children are receiving proper attention from mom or dad. Absent or emotionally parents do not raise emotionally healthy children. Based on the tumultuous relationship between these two people (and their ability to jump in and out of the relationship, with other people too), raising their 15 kids isn\u2019t their top priority. Aside from OP, the older kids are probably being tasked with raising the younger children. Again, not good. \n\nOh and one more thing. Remember 19 kids and counting where the older kid was molesting the younger ones? That\u2019s a very real worry when you have 15 kids between them and can\u2019t possibly supervise all of them correctly."]}
