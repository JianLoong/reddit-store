She agreed and she broke the agreement, that was on her. And I would further explain that my obligation to my daughter far exceeds the wife's \"obligation\" to the friend and that her failure to understand that and that she took extra money from the account is why she will no longer have access to that account.", "That is an insane amount of money to spend in general, let alone on kids that aren't even yours. NTA. She way overstepped a boundary", "NTA. But here's how you can prove your point. Tell the wife you will let her buy all of the original gifts that she had bought and that you'll pay for them, but she has to give you every one of her paychecks until that amount is caught up. In other words, let her spend her money instead of your money on the gifts. My guess is she'll change her tune rather quickly. And the problem with her having her money but the money you make being both of your money is that she will spend her money on her, and your money on her. You need to stay strong in this.", "NTA\n\nFirst, this is your money for your daughter.  This money was ear-marked per prior discussion and agreement with you Ex.\n\n1. You told her  not to go over 300, and she spent nearly 3 times the limit.\n2. You told her to take it back.  She refused.  Again, this is YOUR money.\n3. You took the stuff back to get back YOUR money.  AND you bought the kids replacements, which was as thoughtful as it was above-and-beyond.\n\nShe's the controlling one, here.  And with these three infractions, I would be reconsidering this marriage.  Is she committed to you or her friend?  She needs to pick one.\n\nThings you need to do immediately:\n\n1. Cut off access to your money from her.\n2. Your daughter is more important than her friends kids.  To both of you.  Make her say that out loud.  If she can't agree to that, then why are you married to her?\n3. Tell her that since her friend is obviously never going to plan ahead, that if your wife wants to help, she needs to sacrifice her own money and plan ahead.  You are not longer the fall back.  Stick to your guns.  These aren't your kids.\n4. Counselling.  This friend is more important to her than either YOU or YOUR daughter.  That behavior makes this clear.  You guys need to work this out or you need to move on for your daughter's sake.\n\n\"She felt it was unfair that less fortunate kids had to get less so my daughter could have a car \"\n\nYour daughter's needs come first.  If she wants to be generous, then she should do it with her own money.  Full stop.  You don't get to be generous with other people's money.  That's not how it works.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. $300 limit for gifts for non-family members is more than generous. She definitely overstepped your boundaries.", "NTA \n\nI am bothered by the unwilling to compromise bit. You compromised by giving her money at all for spoiling someone else's kids.  There is nothing wrong with prioritizing your own child first. \n\nAs a step parent who raised two kids I am appalled that she doesn't want to involve herself more with your daughter. When you marry someone who has kids it is a package deal. If you can't grasp that you have no business dating someone with kids in the first place.", "NTA your wife overstepped.", "NTA You wife needs to learn not to write checks her ass can't cash. It's nice to help out other people in the holidays. I am on a fixed income and always budget to participate in our local community giving tree. However, your wife is trying to be Santa Claus on someone else's dime.", "NTA If your wife wants to keep being generous to that degree, she can work more to afford it.", "NTA. Cancel her access to the account, that's absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. You've given your wife permission to use your money within reason. I know some people might jump down my throat over \"you're married, all money is joint money!\" but that's a personal decision, not an obligation. You've said this limiter has been in place for 5 years, so there's no excuse for accidents at this point. You gave her an inch and she took more than a mile. Your family comes before other people's families.", "Absolutely NTA! Your wife's friend's daughter? Are you kidding me? There's generosity and there is abuse of that generosity....this is clearly abuse. Do not put up with it. Your children come first.", "NTA. Your wife can learn to cope with full-time work if she wants to support a whole second family.", "NTA not even a little. But your wife is.", "NTA. By your wife's logic there will always be another family with less. I get that she wants to do something kind and generous for her friend, but by doing so she is being unkind to you and your daughter. This isn't a communal pot of money to share between the less fortunate, this is your money that you have earned and budgeted to support your daughter, who should absolutely be your priority.\n\nYou've been more than generous already. You tried to resolve this through conversation first. You're not an A H here.", "NTA can't believe you let her stay part time and funded her obsession with her friends kids either \n\nMy dad ever the charitable one would never let us have WiFi while spoiling his nephews and nieces", "NTA: She only works part time and you don't even use her money. You set a limit for her and she went over it by like 500 dollars. She did it on purpose Going 50 to a 100 might be a compromise but she went a full 550 over the set limit. Like how does she think thats a compromise. Like I too like nice things for people but I sent a limit and don't go over it and if I do and im using someone else money I ask or just wait on it because sometimes the price might lessen. I think going forward you do not share the your personal account with her anymore since she seems to think she can do what ever she wants. \n\nOn a sidenote why do people think its alright to just do something that they know they aren't supposed and expect to be forgiven? Like I find that behavior extremely manipulative and rude.", "NTA $300 is a ton of money to spend on someone elses kids.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t controlling, this is budgeting and I\u2019m sorry your wife can\u2019t see that right now. $500 is a significant overage, especially this time of year.", "NTA you were already being very generous", "Nta\nI agree with everyone else and would encourage you to remove her access from your accounts.\n\nYour wife is unable to work more then part time but you let her keep it all and cover all bills.  You are being more then fair to her.", "NTA.", "Nta. Almost 3 times a budget when it\u2019s not her own play money isn\u2019t okay full stop", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
