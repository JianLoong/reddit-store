If they\u2019re going to be bathed later then that should suffice. If he\u2019s so adamant, then he should bathe them.

It strikes me as odd that he even went to the zoo with his phobia, so perhaps it's more of a weird control issue? Perhaps I am wrong, but it is also odd that there are scheduled baths. Another weird thing is how is knows when their balls touch the seat...

While children should be taught about germs and the importance of things like washing your hands to avoid them, insisting a kindergartener shower down immediately after getting home just because they used a public toilet is too far. Even if your son doesn't develop a fear of germs, he might pick up on these weird habits, which could cause him to struggle socially later in life. \n\nIt's also kind of fucked that he insists your son needs a shower, but you have to be the one to bathe him.

He can be uncomfortable with the feeling if he wants, but others shouldn't change their behavior to accommodate an unreasonable behavior. He's allowed to want to excessively wash himself or not touch anything in public, but he shouldn't force that behaviour on your child - otherwise your child will end up with germophobic tendencies. \n\nYour son shouldn't learn that he's not allowed to interact with anything because all of the outside world is filthy. He should learn reasonable hygiene (washing your hands before you get home, before eating, if you're visibly dirty, etc), and that it's fine to touch handrails, press elevator buttons, etc. It's fine to interact with the outside world.", "They definitely have said do not bathe every day- it dries out the skin.

For OCD, the worst thing you can do as a partner is whatever he\u2019s asking.

Reasonable and rational is the criteria, and if his request doesn\u2019t meet that, don\u2019t comply.  If he wants YOU to shower every night before bed-don\u2019t.  His germ phobia should not effect you or your kid.  If he can\u2019t live with that then the relationship won\u2019t last.

It keeps the bad things out of your body. It\u2019s not supposed to be kept pristine, it\u2019s the protective cover. \n\n- focus on what your kid actually needs instead of his own anxieties. He should be protecting his kid from his own bullshit as much as he can, not forcing it.\n\n- if he\u2019s really going to bug if the kid doesn\u2019t get a shower, he can shower the kid himself. Making more work for you and the kid because he has a phobia is not okay. \n\n- wash his hands.

Public washroom is not a very clean place.", "Depending on where your husband is from and his background you may in fact be TA. Public bathrooms are gross and depending on what your kid touched all I see is your husband wanting to be sure. I've been in countries where I would absolutely shower if I had to use a public toilet and especially if I had to sit on one. I can't relate to this being a gender role issue. I showered with all of our children boys and girl when they were young because they were slippery and I could manage them better than my wife but she would dry one off while I'd go get the other. It was teamwork.", "NTA because he can do it himself if it\u2019s so important but YTA for calling it weird.

And if your kid is in first grade he\u2019s not being directly supervised to make sure he even washes his hands properly after using the bathroom, let alone prevent his balls from touching the seat etc etc", "I know right? Same with self diagnosis. A lot of the time people over diagnose themselves but at the same time it can take months if not years to actually get to see a doctor.", "In this instance couples therapy won\u2019t prove very useful.

Those are two separate issues. It's up to you if you want to wait around for a result from family therapy, but as someone who went through a similar dynamic with my ex-partner...don't hold your breath expecting him to change. In order for ANY kind of therapy to work, your husband has to own the fact that his behavior is a problem. He has to WANT to change.", "Tbh I think many people who don\u2019t have (idk a better term for it) \u201cterminal\u201d marital problems could benefit from couples therapy. Communication, which roles each person wants to fill - those could all be helped with therapy.", "Omg this is overkill, just all of this!  My germ tolerance is crazy high because I specialize in OCD, but do NOT sanitize the toilet seat man.  Your kid could literally sit on blood on the toilet seat and be fine because 1) everything contagious including HIV dies quickly when exposed to air.  You are not going to catch anything from a toilet seat.  I mean, if there\u2019s diarrhea all over the seat and you sit in it and some of those germs get on your hands, sure you might get a stomach virus, but a little pee?  You\u2019re totally fine!  Old school OCD therapists used to think you needed to be able to pretty much eat something out of the garbage to be \u201ccured\u201d.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love couples work and think it\u2019s super helpful.  However, I don\u2019t think OP should hold out for it as being the think that will fix things because germ phobia and OCD are things the person who has it is the only one that can fix it.

It sounds like you put up with a lot for the sake of not fighting.", "This would only make sense if your husband is afraid of both germs and body wash.

Especially if your skin is intact (no big cuts/lesions).
