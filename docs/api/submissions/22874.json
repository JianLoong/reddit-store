I said that she and Violet are welcome to tag along and she said no, she's not coming, only Violet. I gently said no because respectfully I want to relax on my day off work and enjoy the movie and I don't feel like watching Violet. Not only is she younger and less independent but she's autistic and can be quite a handful (I didn't say this to Emma but she knows). I could see Emma was getting annoyed and she said I'd only be watching Violet during the movie and its only such a small ask. I told her no and that's that. She said I'm excluding Violet for no reason and that I'm playing favorites, and I don't have to deal with Violet being sad that she can't go see the movie with us, but said I obviously don't care because I'm so selfish.\n\nThis upset me a lot and I told Emma to just drop it but she won't, and says that I never offer to babysit Violet but don't have an issue taking Kayla to activities.\n\nMy brother got involved and he said to Emma if she wants me to spend time with Violet so bad she can bring her own daughter to the movies with us and pay for their own tickets. This all snowballed into a massive family rift as my parents got involved too and said that Emma has every right to be upset and I should just bring Violet and that it would make Violet really happy.\n\nI ended up only taking Kayla and she had a blast but this situation has gotten me feeling so crap and I just need to know if I really was right or wrong.", "created_utc": 1690034786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156l1xo/aita_for_not_taking_my_niece_to_see_the_barbie/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a parent of young children part of your job is to advocate for them when they can\u2019t for themselves. Sometimes it can be hard to shut that part off, I imagine it must be even more difficult when your child is not neurotypical, so I don\u2019t want to jump on your sister about it. I wonder if you were to take a deeper look at what is going on with your niece if you would see that she is starting to be excluded more often, not necessarily by you because you seem like a loving aunt, but maybe by others. I think maybe reach out to your sister and talk with her about it.", "Such a small thing to cause a \u201cmassive family rift\u201d over. Humans really are selfish and egotistical creatures. You appear to be in the right in this situation, though, you have zero obligation to babysit a child that isn\u2019t yours", "NTA, your sister was invited.  Violet needs extra supervision and that is your sister's responsibility.  The part of the story that is left out is whether you spend time with Violet.", "NTA OP, you already planned something in advance & it\u2019s not your job to make her choice of having a child easier. I get that she doesn\u2019t want to do it; but she could do other things except dump her issues on you.", "Do you, or will you do something similar for your younger niece when it's her birthday? If the answer is no, than YTA. It sounds like you have a tight knit family, if you're showing favouritism towards 1 niece over the other, of course, that part of the family is rightfully going to be upset.", "NTA. You took Kayla out to celebrate her birthday. Bringing a precocious 5 yr along that you know is likely to act up would have ruined it for her. Unless Kayla specifically requested that Violet come along, you made the right choice. It\u2019s ok to take kids in your family out by themselves. Like other people have said, you can make it up to Violet by taking her places by herself. I think what your family members are not understanding is that going to the Barbie movie with Kayla was about her and having her enjoy her birthday.", "NTA. No other factor matters aside that it was a gift for your older niece", "NTA.  Not every activity is for everyone.  Do something else with Violet.", "NTA Let me start by saying I have a son that is autistic and he can be a lot for my other kids to handle at times. It is not fair to make what is essentially your birthday present for Kayla inclusive of Violet. Emma wants a break and I get it, but you can't force your kid on anyone and you should not expect other people to want to deal with all of the extra that comes with this. Emma doesn't even want to deal with it which is why she doesn't want to take her.", "NTA Your sister had the opportunity to come with you and Kayla, but she turned it down. If Violet is upset, it's your sister's fault, not yours.", "NTA. Autism aside there is a huge difference between hanging out with an 11 year old and having to babysit a 5 year old. This was also a birthday outing for Kayla so you didn't need to bring anyone else along that may take away your attention from her.", "NTA & Emma is. It was a treat for Kayla\u2019s bday, not to mention it\u2019s completely out of pocket to tell you that you\u2019re spending money on her child and providing 2 hours of free childcare. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to not be comfortable watching a child who may have special needs by yourself.

One of them had to go to the bathroom during the movie and they were too young for me to leave one alone in the theater or to send one to the bathroom alone.

This is a pg-13 movie that many adults will be attending on their own, because that\u2019s how it was marketed and that\u2019s who the majority of the humour is intended for.", "NTA.  Your sister just wanted a free babysitter for a break and notwithstanding that movie was not age appropriate for five year old and I'm sure the rest of the movie patrons also thank you for not being a AH.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but bringing an autistic five-year-old to the movie theater for your older niece\u2019s birthday doesn\u2019t sound like much of a treat for her.

I\u2019m glad that your older niece enjoyed her birthday outing", "NTA  isn't that movie PG-13 anyway?", "NTA - I HATE that so many people think they can just dump their kids off on family members. Plus this is a birthday treat for Kayla, there is really no reason for Violet to be there. Having a 5yo at the movies is always a struggle, having a 5yo that is autistic there is just asking for trouble. If you'd have taken her, no one would have had fun. Violet can be disappointed for a while, this was Kayla's day.", "NTA, this was a treat for Kayla for her birthday. It was tacky of Emma to encroach on that bonding time for you and Kayla. Sounds like Emma wants a break from Violet and was trying to guilt you into giving her one.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to take Violet with her Mum also to help with her care needs, this is a reasonable compromise and she said no.", "I haven't seen it yet but isn't the Barbie movie PG-13 \ud83e\udd14 I don't think it is suitable viewing for a 5 year old", "NTA. As the mother and aunt of autistic children, it's a hassle sometimes to even take my 20yo nephew to the movies. He'll leave the theater if the noise is too loud. He's spent entire movies in bathroom stalls. My son will hide under my shirt with his ears covered when the noise is too much. For a lot of autistic people, the surround sound is overpowering. I love them, but I'm minimizing that chaos if I can by streaming movies or waiting until movies die down in hype so the theater isn't full.\n\nViolet will only be sad if Emma tells her about the movie.", "NTA -\nYou said it was a birthday treat for Kayla.  Also PG-13 for a 5 yo may not be appropriate. \n\nIf you want to make peace, take Violet out for a few hours by herself.", "[deleted]", "You were absolutely not wrong. NTA", "NTA why do people think they can dump their kids on any person in any situation and pretend like it's fun for everyone. \n\nAlso, it's not \"excluding\" anyone. It would be if you were taking a bunch of kids and deliberately left her out. But no, this is one on one time with another kid in a definitely-not-5yearold-friendly activity. \n\nA five year old at a movie is a CHORE, and would have made it much less fun for not only you but the kid who was supposed to be having a birthday treat.", "NTA.  This was the older niece\u2019s bday gift.  Violet (and her mom) need to learn that she doesn\u2019t always have to be included.", "nta. this was a birthday treat for an 11 year old. the movie is not appropriate for a 5 year old. babysitting a five year old is very different from babysitting an 11 year old. and once again: it was for her birthday. you can do something special with the 5 year old on her birthday, something she\u2019ll enjoy more than a movie for teens, tweens and adults. (and if mom really cared about her kid feeling excluded, going along with you would have been a solid yes from her. it\u2019s not about the kid, it\u2019s about mom needing a break. which is not your responsibility.)", " Nta its also not a movie for 5 year olds", "I'm confused.... Are you talking about the Barbie movie with Margot Robbie?\nBecause that's rated pg-13....", "NTA it was Kayla's birthday. It seems appropriate for an aunt to spend 1 on 1 time for a birthday.\n\nThe only reason Violet even knows is because Emma told her and caused all this.", "NTA, and you were taking Kayla as a birthday celebration.  As others have mentioned, this Barbie movie isn't for little kids, your sister wouldn't come along and obviously just wanted to pawn her kid off on you.  Tell your parents they're free to take Violet to the movie that's not appropriate for her if they think that's a good idea.", "A five year old autistic child in a movie theater?  HOLY HELL. NTA", "Borderline NAH.  Why?  Because you can't be the AH for only including a birthday girl in plans you made specifically for the occasion.\n\nBut... is Emma's seemingly nutty sense of entitlement towards this situation just a reaction to a status quo where Violet doesn't get the same considerations from you?", "NTA it\u2019s not to small kids who don\u2019t know what is gynaecologist", "NTA once you said it was for Kayla\u2019s birthday, no further explanation was needed.

You were taking your older niece as a bd present. If you or Kayla wanted to open this up to other people, you would have extended the invitation yourself. You have the right to put boundaries on your relationships and how you spend time with people.

As someone with two children, taking children under the age of 7 is a pain in the ass. Their attention spans are short, they get bored quickly and want an insane amount of snacks and drinks. It makes it hard to sit and enjoy the movie.\n\nI don't think the 5 year old would hold a long enough interest in the movie to sit there quitley and comfortably long enough to enjoy it, and you would end up feeling frustrated.\n\nYou can make a play date with Emma to do something more appropriate for her age range and needs. She may enjoy the animated barbie movies more so you could make an at home movie date with snacks, barbie toys and some movies and make it fun.\n\n It also sounds like your sister could be upset because she is looking for some time to herself. Do you or your family take Emma or babysit for her every now and then? Is Emma's father around to help? I would talk to your sister a bit more and find out if there is more to her anger about the situation too.", " NTA. As aunties we are not required to take our siblings' kids to every thing all the time. I have special outings with my nieces and nephews independently of each other all the time. The kids love the 1-1 on time. Your sister is really rude for making you feel bad about something special you were doing for your brother's kid. I'm sure if you wanted to do something special just with her child she'd get upset if you decided to split your attention on her child's \"special day\". You did the right thing. Take your other niece out for a her own day another time and tell your sister to get over it. In the course of a childhood this is such a minor disappointment that will be forgotten in 24 hours by the kid, unless your sister keeps making a big deal about it. Im not sure why her daughter was even told before she asked you if it was ok. If she told her, then she set her kid up for disappointment, not you.", "NAH\n\nFor this particular situation as it was for Kayla\u2019s birthday.\n\nBut it does appear that you are being ableist in general and have less of a relationship with the autistic niece than the other niece because autism makes her more work.

No reason Emma and Violet couldn\u2019t both go, enjoy the movie, and celebrate your niece/their cousin. NTA", "No you're not. I understand, so the family blackmail needs to stop, it was started on purpose and you need to address it. It's called bullying and what is so sad all the adults started and jumped in on it.  What you do and who you do it with on your day off is your business. Stand your ground.", "NTA. This was a gift for Kayla.

She snowballed this situation to the point where your parents are now opining and saying your sisters feelings are justified and you should take the 5 year old.

In fact they can take her to the Barbie movie.", "Nta - sounds like your sister needs a break but it isn\u2019t fair to ask YOU to be the one to give her that break.

Helping to make sure that your little 5 year old cousin sits still through a movie is not the same thing", "And it\u2019s not the year-old\u2019s birthday. This is a present!!!\n\nEveryone else is being ridiculous. And your sister is doing a great job of making sure you never do anything for her.", "Especially not one who is known to be difficult to manage.", "Thank you! This isn\u2019t a even about the etiquette of bringing her. This is not an appropriate movie to bring a small child who is likely to fuss.", "It\u2019s also completely unfair to the many adults in the threatre who did not being children to have a child far too young who is known to be difficult to manage and is likely to be disruptive in the threatre.", "I was talking about this with my coworker lol. There\u2019s gonna be those handful of parents who don\u2019t read the summary or rating, take their young kids, and go shocked pikachu when there\u2019s adult jokes/content.", "And this movie isn\u2019t for young kids (it\u2019s not a movie about a toy\u2026", "As someone with a 5yo I wouldn\u2019t be upset with you for this at all. Maybe if you wanted you could do an animated Barbie movie evening at your house or something with the old school Barbie movies.", " I don't see where you're in the wrong. It sounds like everybody just kind of lost sight of the intention at the beginning, that you're spending time with one niece for her birthday like you did with the other niece a couple months back.", "Absolutely!", "It's a reference to a scene in the Barbie movie.", "Was that a Barbie movie reference? \nPs. I've not watched it yet", "Add to that that she's autistic, so she will need double the attention / energy.", "It means a lot to me personally.", "not to mention the movie is rated pg 13, she can't get in anyways", "Hence the no assholes here judgement.  It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not take a 5 year old on a 13 year olds birthday movie.\n\nBringing Autism into it was not necessary.", "It isn\u2019t ableist. You are not a public accommodation and do not need to make every activity in your life work for Violet. If you consistently excluded her from every family activity, that would be a problem. From what you\u2019ve described, your concerns about including her would apply to a neurotypical 5 year old as well.", "That\u2019s why I said for this incident.\n\nThat a Barbie movie turned into a family rift suggests that there is a lot more going on then you are sharing and violet being excluded is not just this thing.\n\nAlso that you mentioned her autism also suggests that it\u2019s an issue when really the reason you should be using is it\u2019s just a birthday.\n\nThe autism didn\u2019t matter in this case but was brought up anyway.", "She did not state that", "I think it'll be a LOT more than a handful. Most of the folks I speak to legitimately don't even know what the ratings mean anymore, let alone what it says about the content they're about to expose their kid to lol", "I haven\u2019t seen it yet either but can\u2019t fathom wtf the word gynecologist has to do with OP other than someone trying to drag the movie being \u201cwoke\u201d (read: feminist)", "It means a lot to you to insist you are invited to someone else\u2019s birthday treat? That makes no sense.", "You know you\u2019d have to pay extra for childcare for a special needs child, right? Is that ableist? There\u2019s multiple other comments from people with autistic family members now for reference- OP is not being ableist here", "Family rifts can happen for a LOT of reasons. A rift does not mean that OP was wrong. In this case, the family was actually split in their response. The rift happened when some family members agreed with OP's (reasonable, clearly stated) boundary, versus other family members who leaned on the whole \"but faaaaamily\" button in order to try to push OP's boundary.\n\nIt's a false equivalence to insist that OP should treat any 11 year old and 5 year old in the same way in general, let alone when it's the 11 year old's birthday. Instead of assuming the OP brought up the niece's autism as a way of being ableist, it's also possible to see that she may be alluding to the fact that her niece has higher care needs, may have potential sensory issues related to the movie theater setting, etc.", "It\u2019s actually a line in the movie. Won\u2019t make or break the movie and I loved it, but it\u2019s not targeted towards young kids. I took my 13 and 10 year olds and it was fine for them but a lot went over their heads.", "I was referring to small kids asking what that word means after seeing Barbie", "No. \n\nSibling relationships mean a lot to me.", "Yes it\u2019s ableist to charge more for an autistic child because they are autistic.  The question is whether it\u2019s justified.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have blown up if it was just about the Barbie movie.  The OP also didn\u2019t need to include any info about the autism in the post if it was the birthday.\n\nViolet is being excluded because of the autism and based on the reactions of the brother and sister this isn\u2019t a one time thing.", "Ok and? Why is it a bad thing that a kid knows what a gynecologist is? Lady parts exist. There\u2019s a doctor that specializes in treating women and specific issues related to reproduction and childbirth. *Clutches pearls*. How awful.", "It is not ableist to charge more, they have additional needs that means additional care, additional training. Would you prefer it was unfairly paid labour? \n\nOP is not Violet's caretaker, if she doesn't feel comfortable solo babysitting that is perfectly fair. She even suggested violet's mum comes as well with violet and the mum said no.", "It is not ableist to charge more for care of children with special needs. This is because caretakers of those with special needs have to have specialized trainings, lots of the time medical ones to be able to fully care for those children. This combined with the different responsibilities that a caretaker of a autistic child vs the responsibility of a caretaker of a neurotypical child. It depends on the child. Some autistic children are more independent and some need 24/7 care to ensure safety, and many times in those cases you will need to assist them in the bathroom and other daily living skills. It is a specialized job that requires more pay.", "You\u2019ve never said why the mother of the child couldn\u2019t just go. Do you even have any knowledge of autism or know anybody who has it? Because you just don\u2019t seem like you know what you\u2019re talking about. The effects of the disorder have such a massive range that we can\u2019t possibly know anything about Violet\u2019s day to day life from this post. We have no idea what extra care is required, or even if she could tolerate sitting through the movie.", "I disagree see autistic. Kids need more attention more care than a regular child if someone isn\u2019t capable of watching the autistic child why would you want them watching them I see you\u2019re a colorectal surgeon. With that being said, you are a doctor would you be comfortable handling someone with the bone problem or cancer? No because that\u2019s not your specialty right but your doctor you should be able to handle all kind of ailments and if you want to sit here and say well, it\u2019s my specialty that I specialize in this criteria you need somebody that knows how to handle an autistic child to take care of an autistic child", "It\u2019s still ableist.  The question is is it justified.\n\nLet\u2019s say the state paid for daycare for every neurotypical child.  But if you had any special needs you were charged a surcharge.  Would you consider that hypothetical program abliest?  I would.  Would it pass any countries equal treatment laws? Probably not\n\nWhat about accessible bathrooms?  Is it ableist to not provide accessible bathrooms?  It costs more and takes more resources to provide them.  But it certainly would be ableist not to proved them\n\nSo the question isn\u2019t Is it Ableist.  It\u2019s do the circumstances justify the ableism.  In terms of private child care it wouldn\u2019t exist without the premium being paid so in the choice between more expensive and non existent the least worst option is more expensive.  That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not ableist though.\n\nBut if you start to think this way you realize that the public in general would need to subsidize these additional costs to accommodate people with different needs.  We accept that with bathrooms, elevators, ramps, and parking stalls.  We aren\u2019t yet there for daycares.", "Exactly with her being a ass doctor I wouldn\u2019t ask her to look at my head \ud83e\udd23", "Yes I do have first hand experience.  Yes I am sensitive when people use autism as an excuse.", "**It is a PG 13 movie.**"]}
