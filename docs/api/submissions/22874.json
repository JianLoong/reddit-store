I said that she and Violet are welcome to tag along and she said no, she's not coming, only Violet. I gently said no because respectfully I want to relax on my day off work and enjoy the movie and I don't feel like watching Violet. Not only is she younger and less independent but she's autistic and can be quite a handful (I didn't say this to Emma but she knows). I could see Emma was getting annoyed and she said I'd only be watching Violet during the movie and its only such a small ask. I told her no and that's that. She said I'm excluding Violet for no reason and that I'm playing favorites, and I don't have to deal with Violet being sad that she can't go see the movie with us, but said I obviously don't care because I'm so selfish.\n\nThis upset me a lot and I told Emma to just drop it but she won't, and says that I never offer to babysit Violet but don't have an issue taking Kayla to activities.\n\nMy brother got involved and he said to Emma if she wants me to spend time with Violet so bad she can bring her own daughter to the movies with us and pay for their own tickets. This all snowballed into a massive family rift as my parents got involved too and said that Emma has every right to be upset and I should just bring Violet and that it would make Violet really happy.\n\nI ended up only taking Kayla and she had a blast but this situation has gotten me feeling so crap and I just need to know if I really was right or wrong.", "created_utc": 1690034786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156l1xo/aita_for_not_taking_my_niece_to_see_the_barbie/", "score": 2777, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a parent of young children part of your job is to advocate for them when they can\u2019t for themselves. Sometimes it can be hard to shut that part off, I imagine it must be even more difficult when your child is not neurotypical, so I don\u2019t want to jump on your sister about it. I wonder if you were to take a deeper look at what is going on with your niece if you would see that she is starting to be excluded more often, not necessarily by you because you seem like a loving aunt, but maybe by others. I think maybe reach out to your sister and talk with her about it.", "Such a small thing to cause a \u201cmassive family rift\u201d over. Humans really are selfish and egotistical creatures. You appear to be in the right in this situation, though, you have zero obligation to babysit a child that isn\u2019t yours", "NTA, your sister was invited.  Violet needs extra supervision and that is your sister's responsibility.  The part of the story that is left out is whether you spend time with Violet.", "NTA OP, you already planned something in advance & it\u2019s not your job to make her choice of having a child easier. I get that she doesn\u2019t want to do it; but she could do other things except dump her issues on you.", "Do you, or will you do something similar for your younger niece when it's her birthday? If the answer is no, than YTA. It sounds like you have a tight knit family, if you're showing favouritism towards 1 niece over the other, of course, that part of the family is rightfully going to be upset.", "NTA. You took Kayla out to celebrate her birthday. Bringing a precocious 5 yr along that you know is likely to act up would have ruined it for her. Unless Kayla specifically requested that Violet come along, you made the right choice. It\u2019s ok to take kids in your family out by themselves. Like other people have said, you can make it up to Violet by taking her places by herself. I think what your family members are not understanding is that going to the Barbie movie with Kayla was about her and having her enjoy her birthday.", "NTA. No other factor matters aside that it was a gift for your older niece", "NTA.  Not every activity is for everyone.  Do something else with Violet.", "NTA Let me start by saying I have a son that is autistic and he can be a lot for my other kids to handle at times. It is not fair to make what is essentially your birthday present for Kayla inclusive of Violet. Emma wants a break and I get it, but you can't force your kid on anyone and you should not expect other people to want to deal with all of the extra that comes with this. Emma doesn't even want to deal with it which is why she doesn't want to take her.", "NTA Your sister had the opportunity to come with you and Kayla, but she turned it down. If Violet is upset, it's your sister's fault, not yours.", "NTA. Autism aside there is a huge difference between hanging out with an 11 year old and having to babysit a 5 year old. This was also a birthday outing for Kayla so you didn't need to bring anyone else along that may take away your attention from her.", "NTA & Emma is. It was a treat for Kayla\u2019s bday, not to mention it\u2019s completely out of pocket to tell you that you\u2019re spending money on her child and providing 2 hours of free childcare. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to not be comfortable watching a child who may have special needs by yourself.

One of them had to go to the bathroom during the movie and they were too young for me to leave one alone in the theater or to send one to the bathroom alone.

After reading a movie summary, I wouldn't take a young child to it. At best, they wouldn't understand the movie and at worst, be bored the whole time.

If it had been something more age-appropriate the 5yo then the bday girl may not have enjoyed her bday treat as much.", "NTA\n\nFor the sake of EVERYONE ELSE in that movie theatre, please do not bring a young child. \n\nThis isn\u2019t The Adventures of Barbie and her Pony Pals where it\u2019s all parents with young kids and you expect young kids to be chattering. This is a pg-13 movie that many adults will be attending on their own, because that\u2019s how it was marketed and that\u2019s who the majority of the humour is intended for.", "NTA.  Your sister just wanted a free babysitter for a break and notwithstanding that movie was not age appropriate for five year old and I'm sure the rest of the movie patrons also thank you for not being a AH.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but bringing an autistic five-year-old to the movie theater for your older niece\u2019s birthday doesn\u2019t sound like much of a treat for her.

I\u2019m glad that your older niece enjoyed her birthday outing", "NTA  isn't that movie PG-13 anyway?", "NTA - I HATE that so many people think they can just dump their kids off on family members. Plus this is a birthday treat for Kayla, there is really no reason for Violet to be there. Having a 5yo at the movies is always a struggle, having a 5yo that is autistic there is just asking for trouble. If you'd have taken her, no one would have had fun. Violet can be disappointed for a while, this was Kayla's day.", "NTA, this was a treat for Kayla for her birthday. It was tacky of Emma to encroach on that bonding time for you and Kayla. Sounds like Emma wants a break from Violet and was trying to guilt you into giving her one.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to take Violet with her Mum also to help with her care needs, this is a reasonable compromise and she said no.", "I haven't seen it yet but isn't the Barbie movie PG-13 \ud83e\udd14 I don't think it is suitable viewing for a 5 year old", "NTA. As the mother and aunt of autistic children, it's a hassle sometimes to even take my 20yo nephew to the movies. He'll leave the theater if the noise is too loud. He's spent entire movies in bathroom stalls. My son will hide under my shirt with his ears covered when the noise is too much. For a lot of autistic people, the surround sound is overpowering. I love them, but I'm minimizing that chaos if I can by streaming movies or waiting until movies die down in hype so the theater isn't full.\n\nViolet will only be sad if Emma tells her about the movie.", "NTA -\nYou said it was a birthday treat for Kayla.  Also PG-13 for a 5 yo may not be appropriate. \n\nIf you want to make peace, take Violet out for a few hours by herself.", "[deleted]", "You were absolutely not wrong. NTA", "NTA why do people think they can dump their kids on any person in any situation and pretend like it's fun for everyone. \n\nAlso, it's not \"excluding\" anyone. It would be if you were taking a bunch of kids and deliberately left her out. But no, this is one on one time with another kid in a definitely-not-5yearold-friendly activity. \n\nA five year old at a movie is a CHORE, and would have made it much less fun for not only you but the kid who was supposed to be having a birthday treat.", "NTA.  This was the older niece\u2019s bday gift.  Violet (and her mom) need to learn that she doesn\u2019t always have to be included.", "nta. this was a birthday treat for an 11 year old. the movie is not appropriate for a 5 year old. babysitting a five year old is very different from babysitting an 11 year old. and once again: it was for her birthday. you can do something special with the 5 year old on her birthday, something she\u2019ll enjoy more than a movie for teens, tweens and adults. (and if mom really cared about her kid feeling excluded, going along with you would have been a solid yes from her. it\u2019s not about the kid, it\u2019s about mom needing a break. which is not your responsibility.)", " Nta its also not a movie for 5 year olds", "I'm confused.... Are you talking about the Barbie movie with Margot Robbie?\nBecause that's rated pg-13....", "NTA it was Kayla's birthday. It seems appropriate for an aunt to spend 1 on 1 time for a birthday.\n\nThe only reason Violet even knows is because Emma told her and caused all this.", "NTA, and you were taking Kayla as a birthday celebration.  As others have mentioned, this Barbie movie isn't for little kids, your sister wouldn't come along and obviously just wanted to pawn her kid off on you.  Tell your parents they're free to take Violet to the movie that's not appropriate for her if they think that's a good idea.", "A five year old autistic child in a movie theater?  HOLY HELL. NTA", "Borderline NAH.  Why?  Because you can't be the AH for only including a birthday girl in plans you made specifically for the occasion.\n\nBut... is Emma's seemingly nutty sense of entitlement towards this situation just a reaction to a status quo where Violet doesn't get the same considerations from you?", "NTA it\u2019s not to small kids who don\u2019t know what is gynaecologist", "NTA once you said it was for Kayla\u2019s birthday, no further explanation was needed.

You were taking your older niece as a bd present. If you or Kayla wanted to open this up to other people, you would have extended the invitation yourself. You have the right to put boundaries on your relationships and how you spend time with people.

As someone with two children, taking children under the age of 7 is a pain in the ass. Their attention spans are short, they get bored quickly and want an insane amount of snacks and drinks. It makes it hard to sit and enjoy the movie.\n\nI don't think the 5 year old would hold a long enough interest in the movie to sit there quitley and comfortably long enough to enjoy it, and you would end up feeling frustrated.\n\nYou can make a play date with Emma to do something more appropriate for her age range and needs. She may enjoy the animated barbie movies more so you could make an at home movie date with snacks, barbie toys and some movies and make it fun.\n\n It also sounds like your sister could be upset because she is looking for some time to herself. Do you or your family take Emma or babysit for her every now and then? Is Emma's father around to help? I would talk to your sister a bit more and find out if there is more to her anger about the situation too.", " NTA. As aunties we are not required to take our siblings' kids to every thing all the time. I have special outings with my nieces and nephews independently of each other all the time. The kids love the 1-1 on time. Your sister is really rude for making you feel bad about something special you were doing for your brother's kid. I'm sure if you wanted to do something special just with her child she'd get upset if you decided to split your attention on her child's \"special day\". You did the right thing. Take your other niece out for a her own day another time and tell your sister to get over it. In the course of a childhood this is such a minor disappointment that will be forgotten in 24 hours by the kid, unless your sister keeps making a big deal about it. Im not sure why her daughter was even told before she asked you if it was ok. If she told her, then she set her kid up for disappointment, not you.", "NAH\n\nFor this particular situation as it was for Kayla\u2019s birthday.\n\nBut it does appear that you are being ableist in general and have less of a relationship with the autistic niece than the other niece because autism makes her more work.

No reason Emma and Violet couldn\u2019t both go, enjoy the movie, and celebrate your niece/their cousin. NTA", "No you're not. I understand, so the family blackmail needs to stop, it was started on purpose and you need to address it. It's called bullying and what is so sad all the adults started and jumped in on it.  What you do and who you do it with on your day off is your business. Stand your ground.", "NTA. This was a gift for Kayla.

You told your sister she could come along too but that wasn\u2019t good enough.  She snowballed this situation to the point where your parents are now opining and saying your sisters feelings are justified and you should take the 5 year old.

In fact they can take her to the Barbie movie.", "Nta - sounds like your sister needs a break but it isn\u2019t fair to ask YOU to be the one to give her that break.

No because that\u2019s not your specialty right but your doctor you should be able to handle all kind of ailments and if you want to sit here and say well, it\u2019s my specialty that I specialize in this criteria you need somebody that knows how to handle an autistic child to take care of an autistic child", "It\u2019s still ableist.

Is it ableist to not provide accessible bathrooms?  It costs more and takes more resources to provide them.  But it certainly would be ableist not to proved them\n\nSo the question isn\u2019t Is it Ableist.  It\u2019s do the circumstances justify the ableism.  In terms of private child care it wouldn\u2019t exist without the premium being paid so in the choice between more expensive and non existent the least worst option is more expensive.  That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not ableist though.\n\nBut if you start to think this way you realize that the public in general would need to subsidize these additional costs to accommodate people with different needs.

Perhaps tell your sister you will do the same for Violet when it\u2019s her birthday.  Otherwise she can do what you and your brother suggested and come along with her daughter.  She isn\u2019t entitled to infringe on this outing for the sake of free babysitting.  Anyone complaining is free to join you and Kayla and watch Violet themselves.", "NTA. As both a patent and somebody that loves going to the movies. First and foremost your sister clearly just wanted time away from her own kid, which is fine but it's not your responsibility to provide free babysitting for her. If this was specifically about going to the movie, she should have no problem taking her own kid to make her happy. But it's not, it's about you taking one niece for a celebration and your sister thinking she can't just drop your other niece on you so she can get 2-3 hours of time to herself. Also, she probably knows 5yo with autism will 100% be rowdy and act up during thr movie and she doesn't want to deal with that. Which leads me to my second point, as a mother I would never take a 5yo to whats not a \"kid movie,\" whether they were NT or ND if I knew they wouldn't behave. I didn't take my own daughter to see a movie in theaters until she proved she could sit through an entire movie as home without running around or talking to much/loudly. As both parent and movie goer, I believe that kids under 5 honestly shouldn't be taken to the movies (let's all be honest here even for kid movies most children do not have long enough attention spans to sit and pay attention for longer than an hour), and even at 5yo and up, theaters should have specific kid/family friendly show times, and specific non kid show times, so that parents can have the opportunity of a nice family outing, but other movie-goers can also have the opportunity to see a movie without worrying about the potential of rowdy kids. Leading me to my third point: as a movie goer a appreciate you not breaking down and taking the 5yo knowing that she's a handful because I have sat through way too many movies (both with and without my kids) were a good portion of the film was interrupted/ruined by screaming kids or babies. Who tf takes a less than 1yo along to see Top Gun??? Surely you could've gotten a sitter for a measly 3hrs... I don't remember what movie it was, but we were out as a family to the movies and my now 9yo was complaining about how loud and annoying the other kids were being... so no NTA at all.", "NTA because I can see why you wanted to treat Kayla for her birthday and not repeat the same thing for Violet, but is there any chance you could take time to do something else with Violet, even maybe with Emma there too?\n\nI was the youngest cousin and had undiagnosed autism, and I was left out of a lot of things. Even now in my mid twenties I still feel like the outsider of my family and it all began from being excluded in my childhood. Violet may have different needs but it would be nice if you could make some time to do something else with her, even if just for a couple hours", "NTA and it was totally fair for you to insist that Emma come to watch her daughter. It could have been a ladies outing with lunch & everything.", "NTA. You planned a birthday treat for Kayla, Emma had no right to demand you Violet come too.  Including Violet would have changed the get together significantly.  However is there a way to have some special get together with Violet too?

I also have 2 nieces but they\u2019re sisters. 11 and 6. Since moving closer I\u2019ve taken the 11 year old out on a couple outings because I\u2019ve either been pregnant or had a newborn and an 11 year old is much easier than a 6 year old. The 6 year old doesn\u2019t listen very well and tends to get distracted if an activity is too long for her. Which is fine and age appropriate but it limits what we can do. Their mother (my sil) fully understands this and just appreciates that I\u2019m taking one. A 5 year old will not sit through an entire movie without bothering others.", "NTA the time to include Violet is not on Kayla's birthday trip.

Why is she getting creampied so much if she doesn't have the time to take her kid to a movie?", "NTA. \n\nA six year age difference is huge. Plus, from what I\u2019ve heard, Violet may not have even enjoyed the movie as it is not actually geared towards children. \n\nAs Violet gets older, I\u2019m sure there are more activities you can (and will) do with her. But with as young as she is, it is a lot more effort to find something enjoyable for you both.", "Nta. Emma made her sad by telling her she was going to see the movie before checking if it was ok with you. That's not your fault. 5 year olds are way harder to babysit, especially in a public place. I wouldn't want to do it either.", "NTA if Emma wanted Violet to watch the movie so bad, she could have gone with her.", "NTA\n\nIt is obvious Emma wants you to take Violet because she wants a break. \n\nHowever, it is probable she sees your relationship with Kayla and wishes you had that with Violet. You were only eight when Kayla was born, you were able to develop a different relationship with her because you were able to play more of an older sister role. You can tell Emma and your mom that it is unfortunate but because of the age difference, you can\u2019t have the same kind of relationship with Violet and while you understand your sister wants a free babysitter, she shouldn\u2019t try to force you to include Violet in age inappropriate activities like taking her to a PG 13 movie. As an olive branch you could offer to do an age appropriate activity with Violet that  you will choose the activity (unless Emma plans to pay for it) and it will be under three hours-be sure to stress this may end up being a one time only activity (you want to stop Emma from using \u201cbut Violet expected this to happen every Saturday\u201d as a manipulation tactic and you also do not want Emma taking advantage of the babysitting).\n\nGood luck", "NTA", "NTA. Neither of these kids are your children and you\u2019re not obligated to do anything for or with them.

The issue is that because it IS a movie for adults, the audience will be expecting to not have to deal with the likely disruptions of an unpredictable 5-year old. Also, your sister is making huge presumptions - that you will provide free babysitting and split your attention for the birthday kid with her kid, and that this is just expected. She doesn\u2019t view your time as valuable or worthy of being respected. A good sister would ask if she and her kid could BOTH tag along to celebrate the birthday kid instead of making the whole event about her kid. NTA.", "NTA - this was a birthday treat for Kayla.

The adults, Emma specifically, are acting entitled as if it\u2019s your job to take her daughter to the movie. It is not. You were treating your niece to a movie for her birthday, that is a special treat and the movies aren\u2019t very cheap. It is also a hassle to take younger children to the movie bc they can be more rowdy and not know how to act in the theater. Personally I think you made the right decision.", "NTA\n\nBut I think it can be hurtful for your sister too.

The 11-year-old was probably no trouble.", "NTA- First of all, the new Barbie movie is PG-13 and is not appropriate for a five year old. Second, Emma was just trying to use the movie to get free babysitting.", "I have an autistic family member that age. I love her to pieces and love when I get to see her. She requires my full attention for her safety and comfort (she likes to run). I wouldn\u2019t take her to a movie that I was bringing another young family member to for their birthday because it may would result in me leaving the theater with her multiple times. It would shift the focus off the bday girl (who would either have to leave with us or sit alone) and off the movie. NTA. \n\nIf Emma could use some help, maybe there is another day that you can come play Barbie or have a Barbie themed ice cream party do something else with Violet so Emma can go relax for an hour or two and you and Violet get some special 1 on 1 Barbie time. I\u2019m sure both your sister and niece are very important to you and wanting to give Kayla a day of your attention does not negate that you love Violet. You aren\u2019t slighting her because you are being practical. \n\nIf Emma does not talk about you going to Barbie, Violet will never know. \n\nAlso, I haven\u2019t seen the Barbie movie but it seems like it\u2019s not made for kids that young.", "NTA and it\u2019s pretty obvious hanging out with your 11 yo niece for her birthday is completely different than the responsibilities of watching over a 5 yo autistic kid. I can understand your sister wanting her daughter to be included but to your point, they are welcome to come together. Also it\u2019s very  manipulative of your sister to use her daughter as a pawn for emotional blackmail when she mentioned Violet being upset. Violet is a 5 year old - the only reason she\u2019d be upset is if her mom is telling her she\u2019s excluded in the first place. This sounds more like projection and insecurity from your sister, which I\u2019d guess is due to some sort of jealousy over your relationship with Kayla and/or the fact that her daughter is more of a handful to deal with. These feelings of hers seem a lot bigger than just a day at the movies, and your family would probably benefit from a little group therapy to air this out.", "NTA. That movie is NOT for children. Every person who has seen it so far has said not to bring kids. Emma needs to get over the fact that you dont want to take Violet. Violet is not your responsibility.", "NTA but this could have been handled a bit more delicately: \u201cIt\u2019s for Kayla\u2019s birthday and I want to spoil her/make it all about her/etc. this time.

If your sister needs help with her neurodivergent child then she should ask, not try to guilt you into it. It is hard to have a child with autism, and to be honest a cinema is not always a good choice. For example, my child with it finds the darkness and loud speakers can be overwhelming, hence why they have screenings for such people.\n\nYou could then spend some time with her separately at a different time, the mum is just being selfish.\n\nAlso this is for the 11 year olds birthday, if you take the 5 year old autistic child it will be all about her and your older niece will be neglected nomatter how hard you try.

NTA. \nPs I don\u2019t think your sister was necessarily being an asshole here for wanting a day off from special needs, but she is blinded by her feelings & not seeing it clearly. \nYour parents on the other hand are doing the whole adult replication of include your younger sister in whatever plans you have. Her not being able to see other people\u2019s perspective is definitely youngest child syndrome. \nMaybe once she gets past the hurt feelings you & her & possibly your brother should plan to do something fun together.
