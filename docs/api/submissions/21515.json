I (20M) got into a minor accident a few weeks ago where I got hit by an electric bike. No long term damage, but I ended up busting my shoulder and getting two infected cuts and a black eye. My mom (63F) and dad (61M) happened to be in town so they took me to the ER. I was pretty clear the entire time that I was in a fair amount of pain, and while I was grateful for the ride, would generally prefer to speak to the doctor alone. However, when the nurse brought me to my room, my mom followed. I knew it would hurt her feelings if I asked her to leave, so I figured I would deal, but then the nurse asked my to take off my clothes/into a gown and I began to feel really uncomfortable with her being there. I don\u2019t like being any level of undressed in front of anyone, so I asked her to leave. I guess she misunderstood me, because once I had the robe on she came back in. I was still basically naked (the robe didn\u2019t have a tie in the back) so I expressed that I was uncomfortable and asked if she could wait in the waiting room. At this point, my mom starts freaking out, begging me to stay, and I\u2019m in a lot of pain, and increasingly uncomfortable, so I just keep asking until she left. Afterwards, my mom said that I \u201cmade her look abusive to the staff, and really hurt her.\u201d I said I was sorry, but that I had tried to set a boundary and she wasn\u2019t respecting it and I hadn\u2019t spoken about her at all to the nurses after she left. My mom now thinks that I \u201clove boundaries more than her\u201d And I that I \u201cwon\u2019t be able to have a happy relationship\u201d until I fix things with her. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep. AITA?\n\nEDIT FROM THE COMMENTS:\n\nI feel like I should add that I love my mom a lot, and she\u2019s genuinely coming from a good place. We get along fine 90 percent of the time, she\u2019s just old fashioned, and I wanted to know if I was actually being hurtful or if she was just interpreting it that way.

NTA", "NTA your mom mad herself look abusive when she refused to respect your boundaries. The comment about loving boundaries more than her tells me everything I need to know. Healthy people respond to a boundary by respecting it, its very normal for someone to wish to speak to a doctor in private. Perhaps you had some private questions to ask, perhaps you needed to show them an injury and would have felt embarrassed about it with your mom present. Either way, it's extremely normal to want some alone time with a doctor. Your mom is being manipulative and gaslighting you. Keep your boundaries, they're more important than your mom's feelings on the matter.", "NTA, your mom has some serious issues if she's more worried about what the hospital staff think than respecting your boundaries though.", "NTA. As a mom I can understand her going in with you - old habits and all that - but she should have left as soon as you asked. I hope you are feeling better!", "NTA. And I think it *is* that deep. You have boundaries. Your mother doesn't think you should have boundaries. I don't think you're going to have a relationship with her, at least in the near future, since she's the one who needs to fix things.\n\nMaybe talk to your dad about this.", "NTA.  You didn't make your mom look \"abusive,\" she did.  She's. being manipulative now to try to guilt you into changing or apologizing for your  boundaries.  Stand firm.  Some parents can't seem to respect that their children grow up and become autonomous, independent beings.  If you give in on this, she'll just keep trying to bulldoze right over your boundaries forever.", "NTA your mom sounds like she is very emotionally abusive though the whole \"you love boundaries more than you love me\" thing is a text book example of that. She is trying to make sure you readjust your boundaries so it fits what she wants rather than what you are comfortable with. Whilst its hard to express exactly that to her because no matter what she will take it badly. But if I was in your situation I would have said of course I love my boundaries more they are set up for a reason and that is to protect yourself. That does not mean she is not loved but it shows how important they are to me. Like its 100% that would have ended in another arguement but it is inevitable until she understands. Pointing out her emotional abuse will most likely make it worse. Just know you are not the ass hole here and you shouldnt have to worry about someone elses feelings over your own needs.", "NTA. I have some sympathy for your mom as she was obviously worried about you, and old habits (of taking care of you when you're sick, going in with you to the doctor etc) die hard. But you were right to set this boundary and you shouldn't apologize for it, if you want to have a good adult relationship with your mom, she's going to need to learn to respect your boundaries and treat you like an adult.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When an adult requests a boundary, I can understand there is potential for misunderstanding and perhaps a little bit of hurts feelings, initially in the moment, but not repeatedly trying to impose their will over the child.  Once the a few minutes go by and the child is going to be fine, a Mom who is genuinely there to support the child, will likely break the ice, apologize if appropriate, and then it's all water under the bridge.\n\nYour injuries were bad enough without the added emotional baggage.  Give it time and it should be fine, as long as you don't give in on your newly established boundaries.  Be kind and understanding but fine on your position.", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA. you are an adult and are well within your right to want privacy for your emergency medical appointment.\n\nShe sounds like she might have always been a helicopter parent which must make it hard for her to be faced with a boundary by you.

I could understand if your Mom\u2019s feelings were hurt because she\u2019s your Mom & you kicked her out when she wanted to help .... or if she was overly concerned because you were in so much pain but I have no idea why she would care what the staff think. Very strange\n\nI kind of agree it\u2019s just not that deep. The most important part of the story is that you\u2019re okay.

A non-abusive parent would be more than willing to abide by your boundaries in such a fraught situation. An abusive parent would push, argue and invalidate your request without concern for what you wanted because her own feelings and desires are more important than yours. Source: I worked as a cna and/or safety companion for nonagenarians for over a decade. I also now put my skills to use caring for my elderly parents and accompanying them to dr appts. \nTimes when _i_ ask if any client wants me to leave the room temporarily or permanently: when the nurse calls us back to the exam room, when anyone begins taking history or otherwise discussing private medical info, any time any clothes are adjusted/removed or any invasive/hands-on examination takes place, when the doctor comes in, before the doctor leaves and once or twice at random.
