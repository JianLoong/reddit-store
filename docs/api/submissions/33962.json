The Will divided the estate into equal portions for each of my grandparents\u2019 four kids. But since my father died, his portion will be divided equally between my brother and myself. My mother lives with my brother, his wife, and his two kids. Both my mother and my brother said I should give my inheritance to her, since that\u2019s what my grandparents would have wanted. They plan to use my brother\u2019s portion to remodel their basement into a mother-in-law suite. The inheritance isn\u2019t life-changing money, but it is a fair amount. If they didn\u2019t go crazy with extravagance, the money would be enough to pay for the remodel two or three times over, so I don\u2019t know why they think they need my portion as well. If it matters, I\u2019m not single. I am married and have two kids. I\u2019ll admit that when I first found out about the will, it didn\u2019t occur to me to give the money to my mother. She collected from three life insurance policies when my dad died and her expenses are fairly low since she\u2019s living with my brother. But I also know that I have some negative thoughts/feelings toward my mom because of things she\u2019s said to me, the way she acted when my dad died, and the fact that the one thing of my father\u2019s that I asked for she gave away after promising it to me. My mother has been laying on the guilt trip pretty hard about the inheritance and one of the last things my dad said to me was to please take care of my mom. My uncle told me that the money is mine and I should do whatever I want with it. He took care of my grandparents and said their will is exactly how they wanted it.

If they had wanted her to have a share, they\u2019d had rewritten their wills to do that.\n\nI speak from experience on this.  My in-laws left a large estate.  They specifically set up a trust that bypassed the spouses.  If my husband dies before me, none of the money in that trust goes to me.  It legally cannot.

Do not give anything away until you have all the legal ramifications in place. \n\nWe learned a ton about inheritance when my FIL died. His will was deemed invalid which meant that after the first 15% the remainder is divided between all of the heirs (in this case my husband who is an only child and my monster is law).\nShe tried (and succeeded) on several occasions to prevent my husband from getting any inheritance but the downfall was the 2 physical houses that she had placed only in FIL\u2019s name. Which meant we found out about everything 3.5 years after FIL\u2019s death and 2.5 years of no contact. \n\nMy point- whomever is executor of the will must show that each party involved has been fully compensated. So that means with the death of your father, you and sibling receive what was left for your father. This is just basic inheritance and obviously it sounds like you are guaranteed by a valid will. \nIf the grandparents want a change, that\u2019s on them. \n\nWe learned about this when monster wanted to sell one of the homes (and prior to this phone call we believed that monster inherited everything) and it was a real estate lawyer who found out about monster hiding hubby\u2019s inheritance claim. The caller said hubby needed to write and notarize a statement declining his inheritance. \n\nWe ultimately learned that if we gave her anything that our own \u201cestate\u201d at death would be an issue for our sons (who are to inherit everything).\nSo do some research too.", "NTA. The will could have easily said if your dad died then his share would go to your mom. If a lawyer was involved, then I think it\u2019s fair to assume that\u2019s not what your grandparents wanted. If your grandparents just scribbled out a will leaving assets to their kids and the default rules kicked in to give your dad\u2019s share to you and your brother, not your mom, then maybe there\u2019s a question of intent. In any event, it sounds like your mom and brother want to use the money to benefit just themselves, not you, so not surprising they want you to hand it over.
