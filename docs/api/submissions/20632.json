He needs to set his own priorities.", "NTA,\n\nI also stayed at home for university instead of going away, despite getting firm offers from better universities.\n\nMy reasoning was that I could graduate with 0 debt and also help my parents with my younger siblings and their school runs, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, your brother doesn't need the money, for something essential, it is for something purely cosmetic (I'm assuming), and if it is not necessary, save up and don't go into debt even if it's with family.\n\nEven now many years after I've graduated I only buy things on credit, when I have the money to pay it off outright and I can get a 0% finance deal for the long term purchase like a car", "We only have one guardian who know won\u2019t pay for it. Not in a bad way but she wants us to be more financially independent. She\u2019s also financially focused on many other things right now. \n\nMy brother and I are probably going to be the first financially independent people in our family for a generation and since we were younger we\u2019ve always \u201cshared\u201d pocket money - this didn\u2019t extend to when we got our bank accounts though. I\u2019m wondering if it stemmed from that, where we always do things for and with each other.", "If it were critical I\u2019m sure our guardian would have paid for it. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to happen of course but it\u2019s what I predict. If she didn\u2019t pay for it then I\u2019d be happy to help. It\u2019s just minor teeth straightening which I myself want to get done too.", "By that I meant I don\u2019t think he should see his friends less often. Instead, choose other cost efficient activities to do with them . I also know that he parties and drinks a lot which is fine, but instead of three drinks have less per night.", "Drinkers gonna drink.", "It sure is easy to spend other people's money. You've both made your choices on how to live, and those choices come with both good and bad consequences. You're electing to go on holiday, he's choosing **elective** dental work.\n\nNTA for not giving him any money. You're both living within your means, he just doesn't have as wide a margin as you do. He's not entitled to raid your bank account just because there's more money there than in his bank account.", "INFO. Hold up. You live with a single parent who works 24/7. So they never sleep, eat, wash up, or anything else - 24/7 they are working.\n\nJust wondering what job has someone working 24/7. Not on call or standby, but actually working every moment of every day.", "NTA.  He WANTS dental work done.  Work that is not necessary.  That is up to him to find a way to pay for his cosmetic procedure.  If it were necessary & he was struggling I'd say help him out, but he's not struggling, he's just not budgeting properly.  I wouldn't give him a dime.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money, you choose what you do with it, especially since he has money but spends it on useless things. You act smart with your money so you have some, he acts stupidly with his so he doesn't. Don't be ashamed to keep your money", "Nta. You\u2019ll learn this as you grow. But just because you have something , doesn\u2019t mean you need to give it to family or loved ones. As you said he CAN save up for his (wanted not needed dental work) it will just take longer. Most people have to save for things they NEED in this world so him saving for this thing he wants done is OK. If you start giving just because \u201cyou already have it\u201d people will continue (your brother) to ask you for more. You are not evil if you just tell him he should save his money until he can afford the thing he wants or if you feel really bad (you have no reason to , but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t continue to feel the way we do) you can offer to pay for it now but he has to agree to monthly installments until the amount is payed back. \n\nThis is your money . He is also getting money but is using it for room and board. You are able to save yours because you live at home. It\u2019s not fair in my opinion that your brother gets the on campus college life plus your money for a WANTED not needed dental work. This is your money and it\u2019s okay to say no, and just because someone calls you selfish (which your brother might) doesn\u2019t make it true. He will say it to guilt you because he didn\u2019t get what he wanted.(possibly) or he\u2019s a cool guy and will understand you saying no.", "NTA- I mean if its a large amount of money and you want to make sure to get it back, I would demand it in writing.", "INFO: did you mean give the money as a loan, or you pay for his dental work? Either way, why didn't you just say no to begin with? He has more money than you and you will need it for your own things.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t have siblings, but a best friend who is like my sister.\n\nI know she\u2019s got close to $20k in her saving rn, and I don\u2019t have much as I\u2019m going to school and paying for all my own stuff. \n\nI really want (kinda need low key) lasik eye surgery. It\u2019s about $5k for both eyes. \n\nI don\u2019t have the money for it right now, but I\u2019m NOT going to beg/demand/ask for it from my \u201csister\u201d", "Nta", "NTA. Your brother can take out a loan. Don't give him money.", "Exactly. And what if something happens and OP ends up needing dental work (or anything else!) in a couple months. Then they've got no extra money for their own needs.\n\nPlus, housing is expensive as shit and I assume OP won't want to live at home forever, so that money will be useful then too.", "She does sleep and eat but can be away for 12 hours on a normal day. In some cases she can be away on business trips for days or even weeks. She gets weekends off too but if we\u2019re out one day, she\u2019s working at home the next.  I don\u2019t know how or why she works so much but because of this I don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving the dogs.", "It\u2019s around 1.5k - 2k. He has said that he would want to pay me back but I don\u2019t really trust him with  that. \n\nI\u2019ve paid for things he wanted in the past which he told me he\u2019d pay me back for but that\u2019s just added up to over \u00a3300 which I\u2019ve never seen again.", "He does not have more money than me, I think I worded it poorly though. I meant to say that he works over the summer so he can *get* more money in his bank. His balance is pretty low since all of his money grants go towards accommodation.", "I also want the same dental work he wants done (straightening my teeth) but I\u2019m waiting until I have a job to do that."]}
