They have previously rented. My brother asked me back last summer if they could live with me and my wife in our new house we purchased in Fall 2021. My wife and I are well off, both have high paying jobs, no kids, and our house is bigger than we need. I told my brother that it should be fine and asked how long they need to stay. He said until the end of the year which should give him enough time to save up some money and pay off some credit card bills and look for a house. Agreed upon time was from August until December.\n\nAt first, everything was great. I love my brother and his wife and I enjoy spending time with them. Over time, though, I noticed that the timeline wasn't adding up. They moved in a bunch of stuff, took over our pantry, and stored stuff in areas I told them I didn't want it. It didn't appear they were making much effort looking for a home either and when I asked him about it, he said mortgage interest rates are too high. He bought a good bit of stuff too like a 3090Ti graphics card, expensive collectibles, etc. I'm not judging him on what he spends his money on but the whole point of this was for him to save money. I'm not charging him anything at all to live here and I even paid for their meals a few times.\n\nIn November I asked him what his plans were. I told him it takes a long time to close on a house and this would go past the December date we agreed upon. He said he now needed to stay until the summer. Once I heard this, I realized that once summer gets here, the date may get pushed again for as long as I allow. I work from home so having someone here most of the time where previously there wasn't has been a change for me. As much as I appreciate spending time with them, I was ready to have my privacy and quietness back.\n\nOne night we let them know that we'd be happy to extend the deadline to the end of February but summer will be too long. He seemed to take it okay at the time but things have gotten weird. I understand that he's hurt and feels like his brother is kicking him out because essentially, I am. In the past few weeks, they have been mostly standoffish. They will talk to us some nights and on others they lock themselves up in their room. They decided that they aren't staying until February and have already packed up most of their stuff and moved it out. They do have arrangements to stay with their parents until summer. Today, their food was given away to one of their coworkers instead of being offered to us. We haven't received any thanks or anything and now I feel like we're going to be portrayed as the bad guys to our families for kicking them out. I did this to help them but it seems it has backfired. My mom has already guilted me by saying \"This is your brother, are you sure you can't let him stay longer?\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671127855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmrtwk/aita_asking_family_to_move_out_at_our_agreed_upon/", "score": 597, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get that it is hard to save up for a home basically everywhere. But it is not your responsibility to pay their way while they faff around and take advantage of your hospitality. \n\nIf your mom is so concerned, why doesn\u2019t she let them move in with her, rent free? After all \u201cthis is her son, is she sure she can\u2019t let them stay\u201d?", "NTA - they asked for temporary accomodation, you provided and they then proceeded to take over your house and now seek to make this a permanent free residence.  They need to get their crap together and go find another rental if that's what it takes.  You've run that gravy train long enough and are entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of your home without their junk everywhere.  Tell your mom she's welcome to house them if she thinks making them arrange living quarters of their home is too hard for two grown ass adults.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019ve overstayed their welcome and made no effort to prepare to buy/rent/move. They were totally willing to keep taking advantage of you. \n\nIf your family is up in arms, tell them they\u2019re welcome to house everyone. You\u2019ve done your turn.", "NTA.\n\nYou're absolutely right - he was planning on just continuing to take advantage of your generosity. Parents can let him mooch indefinitely if they're so concerned.", "NTA.\n\nHe was not realistic of the timeline and/or honest when he approached you with the situation, then it took you talking to him about when they were moving out. \n\nEven if they were saving all their money, the initial agreement was Aug-Dec, living rent free. You have every right to say you don\u2019t want to extend the agreement. Given they had 4 months to save up, looking for a place to rent with 2 1/2 months notice wouldn\u2019t have been a big issue so it\u2019s not like they would have been homeless. \n\nFamily or not, they took advantage. Let them take advantage of someone else.", "NTA.\n\nYou've given them a deadline. This also needs to he a formal WRITTEN notice, and start eviction proceedings if they don't budge", "NTA.   House guests are like fish - they go bad after about 3 days.  In your case, 4 months.  You gave a reasonable deadline and even a reasonable extension.   He's your brother not your child.   Time for him to grow up.", "NTA. You generously let them stay  with you for months. Let the people who say things like, \"This is your brother. are you sure you can't let him stay longer?\" invite him & his wife to live with them.", "*I noticed that the timeline wasn't adding up.* \n\nA lot of their behavior doesn't add up.  If you take their words, and list them on one side, and their actions, and put them on the other, and add those up, the sums at the bottom of each column are vastly different.  One side says they are staying for a short while and saving up.  The other side says they are planning to stay as long as you let them, years, and that they will slowly take over your house and make it theirs.   **Believe the actions.  Their words are deceptive.**\n\n*They moved in a bunch of stuff, took over our pantry, and stored stuff in areas I told them I didn't want it.* \n\nSo, **rudeness, inconsideration, putting their wants first, ignoring your rules** by putting stuff where you said not to, **basically taking over your home and pushing to see how far they could get.**  \n\n*It didn't appear they were making much effort looking for a home either and when I asked him about it, he said mortgage interest rates are too high.* \n\nHe's not been looking.  His plan was just words, not a real plan.  \n\n*He bought a good bit of stuff too*\n\nBecause while he's living on your expense, and not having to spend on rent and utilities, he's got money to spend where he wants to spend it.  **He's not saving his money, he's using your support to let him spend it on toys** instead of basic living.\n\n*One night we let them know that we'd be happy to extend the deadline to the end of February but summer will be too long.* \n\n**You set a deadline.  You set a boundary.**   Last time you talked, he told you his intention was to stay another six months or so.  He didn't realize that you would walk away from that and basically be saying \"hell, no.\" in your mind.  So, here you are, setting a deadline to him and he's not expecting that.  **A set boundary, to a manipulator, is enough to make them angry at you for not letting them continue to manipulate you.**  \n\n*He seemed to take it okay at the time but things have gotten weird.*\n\nThat's because he is trying to adjust to the news that you being nice to him for four months wasn't because you are going to comply with his wants and let him manipulate you as long as he wants to.  He expected to stay, and to keep on taking over, slowly, while you kept on letting him.  **He didn't expect a hard boundary.  So, he's been figuring out how to spin this, how to profit off it, how to manipulate someone else**. \n\n*They decided that they aren't staying until February and have already packed up most of their stuff and moved it out.* \n\n**They got caught.   You caught out their lies,** that they were saving money, that they were looking for a place, that they were setting goals that they never planned how to meet.   They feel uncomfortable now, around you, knowing that you figured out their ploy and caught them at it, and you aren't going to let them get away with this.    They are moving on as fast as they can, because they got caught, and they want to sponge off another victim. \n\n*We haven't received any thanks or anything*\n\nYou would have, if they felt gratitude.  **They obviously don't feel gratitude, but entitlement,** the way they have treated your home already.\n\n *and now I feel like we're going to be portrayed as the bad guys to our families*\n\nThey might.  You can try to spread the truth, counter any ignorant comments with truth.  You can even do social media posts, if that's your thing, like wishing them well as they move out and on to another place, because you had agreed to house them for four months.  \n\n *for kicking them out.*\n\n**You did not kick them out.  You merely kept them to the agreement** between you.  They can pretend otherwise, but that's not truth.  You said end of the year, and then extended that to Feb.  They are the ones choosing to leave early.  You didn't kick them out.  **You held them to their word, the agreement made between you.**  If they had signed a lease and the lease expired, they wouldn't be being kicked out, they would be moving on because their lease expired.  That's what this is, their agreement expired.\n\n *I did this to help them but it seems it has backfired.*\n\n**People who don't yet know them, will learn soon enough that they are playing victim and blaming others, instead of taking responsibility** for their own lives.  I doubt that this is the first time he's done this, and I doubt it will be the last time, either.  \n\nBe very careful in the future, what you agree to do for them, and if you bail them out of anything.  They are people that will take, suck you dry like the emotional vampires they are, and then blame you for not giving more.    The truth is, **they are the predators, not the victims** here.  **Protecting yourself is the way forward here.** \n\nNext time your mom tries to guilt you, flip the discussion to how she's going to protect herself.  Has she set a deadline for when they are leaving?  Has she told them to put their stuff in storage, not all over her house?  Does' she have rules for her house, so that her stuff isn't pushed aside while they take over?", "NTA and ask your mother why he couldn't stay with them", "NTA. You had an arrangement, you stuck to what you said. \n\nYou would be TA if you allowed them to live indefinitely with you. They need the harsh reality to motivate themselves. They need to accept their decision, to do nothing, has consequences. \n\nNow you know why they struggled to buy. It was never that they couldn't, they chose to prioritize spending it all.", "Nta", "> \"This is your brother, are you sure you can't let him stay longer?\".\n\n\"Clearly not.\"  When people ask you dumb questions, give them dumb answers.

You offered a compromise.  They've decided to find alternative arrangements and move out as requested.  What's the problem?  They're being a bit sour about it?  Of course they are.  They had a good gig going and now that gravy train has come to an end and now they have to go back to acting like grownups.  Or at least, now they'll have to start taking advantage of someone else's hospitality.  It's about to not be your problem anymore, so let them leave with all the grace and dignity they choose to muster.  It's not a requirement that they go away happy, it's just a requirement that they go away. \n\nIf you were instead expecting them to kiss the ground you walk on and profusely thank you for the extensive kindness you showed them, I would use your disappointment as a lesson for the future the next time a friend or family member requests a short stay at your expense.", "\u201cHe\u2019s your son, it\u2019s more of your responsibility.

Hahaha. He is taking the piss. Well done for not standing for it.", "NTA, they lied, tried and took advantage of your generosity and hospitality. There seems to have been no effort to save up for their own house, a 3090ti is expensive, hence why I think they were taking advantage of you.", "They did this to themselves. They spent months living rent free, saving at least a $1000 a month from that alone, and you paid for some of their food. \n\nInstead of saving money for a downpayment *(It really doesn\u2019t take a ton! Partner and I bought our first house with $10k total down for closing costs and downpayment, within the last 6 months.)*, they bought expensive luxuries."]}
