If you can afford it you can help her out of kindness (but you are not obligated) and tell her that you only keep on helping her if she shows all of her spendings to you even the last cent she spends. \n\nIt's possible that secretly she's helping somone, or that she is addicted to something etc. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Maybe you should look closer at her finances. How is she throwing money away like that?", "Gambling it's gambling", "NTA. If your mom lives comfortably with the same amount of money, your MIL can\u2019t handle money. I wouldn\u2019t pay for that either. Actually I wouldn\u2019t even pay for her food etc. Simply get her some course on how to handle your finances. Supporting parents/in-laws if they really need the money is absolutely the right thing but that woman is just wasting your money (for your retirement\u2026)", "NTA. If she asks again, tell her you will only consider helping if she is honest about the debts and provides you with receipts. It sounds like she needs to be forced into honesty about some part of her life that is problematic and either an addiction or a scam. So you guys may want to try to formulate a plan to intervene, but one that doesn\u2019t necessarily involve you solving her debt problems by just paying them off for her, but instead figuring out what they are and assisting her in resolving them herself by helping her face/stop her behaviour and come up with a plan to tighten her belt.", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you and you are letting her do it. Stop enabling her and make her pay all her bills.", "She wouldn't tell. Doesn't seem she is buying much stuff. Not living fancy either. It's all the same vague explanation she is short. We got a suspicion that there might be a gambling problem, but nothing that would prove it, and it's not like we would hire PI to figure this out.", "I have no idea. No medical issues we would know about. She is fairly active and seems to be feeling well. No fancy things at the house. She wouldn't tell, and math is not adding up.", "We asked not to borrow from anyone else and come to us when she is short. It is not a problem to give her 200-300 hundred when she is short, but suddenly, there is 1k+ debt from somewhere it gets overwhelming. Ar the end of the day, it is us who end up paying anyways.", "NTA then. I am also kind of supporting my parents now (paying their monthly bills and 50% of food) and while I don't mind giving them money to spend on wants; I expect transparency on how it is being spent if I do ask. \n\nA little $50 or $100 once a week is all cool. But seems like your MIL's antics is getting form bad to worse and affecting your family's finance. Your husband (and to that extend, your family) is not her retirement funds.", "She won\u2019t tell means you won\u2019t pay. NTA.", "Thank you. I realize now this is exactly what is bothering - lack of transparency. She owes us some honest answers.", "NTA. She is either gambling or into drugs or some other thing that is causing her to spend and not get anything back. \n\nShe is taking advantage of you. Cut the strings.", "NTA. I saw in comments you don\u2019t think she\u2019s spending frivolously. Does she have any other kids or family and could she be giving the money to them?", "NTA- stop paying unknown debts. I\u2019ll point out that you should have been requesting more info on the debts and/or setting her up with budgeting. It\u2019s your right to know how she\u2019s spending the money since you are the ones always bailing her out. If you continue helping with food and rent I\u2019d go ahead and sit down and say if she wants that continued help she needs to allow you to organize her finances and set up a budget for her.\nIf she doesn\u2019t like that then she should pay her own bills.", "NTA- with the food, you might want to do gift cards if you think gambling might be in the mix.", "NTA. Does she have some kind of addiction? Alcohol or gambling?", "YTA to yourself you need to cut her off completely she will bleed you dry.", "NTA and I remember reading something similar, where the MIL was getting pumped with money \"because of her debts\" and it turned out she was just giving the money to other family members/friends, making herself appear wealthy. Since you have no clue where all the money goes, maybe that could be it. Either way, you should supporting those unknown debts she keeps piling up", "NTA", "NTA but I'd be wanting to know where my money was going - that was your biggest mistake. We loaned our son a significant amount of money to cover his debts but he had to hand over his finances. We discovered some really poor financial decisions and my husband was able to get him better at managing his finances. He's been consistent repaying us and has gotten a much better job.", "NTA. She has to step up.", "*stop supporting", "I bet it's gambling. My ex was a gambler and this sounds very familiar.", "Her poor managing of finances is not your problem, it's her problem. NTA", "NTA", "You are not her ATM", "NTA and it is sad that it took as long as it did to get to this point. Keep this boundary OP and make sure your husband is FULLY on the same page and does not get guilted into helping behind your back. \n\nAlso, you made a clear concern at the beginning, which is to not borrow from anyone else. Your MIL needs to have financial counseling to learn how to manage as she clearly cannot handle her finances right now. Please ensure that she seeks help for that and good luck", "NTA either she has gambling issue or is paying for sex. Do t be surprised that women her age need a little company every now and then .", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019m really concerned that this wasn\u2019t lifelong behavior for her. Would she be willing to have a cognitive assessment?\n\nIt could also be a gambling issue, or someone in her life is taking advantage of her - either way it\u2019s definitely reasonable to refuse to pay unknown debts. You need more information.", "THIS. When my sister was going through her divorce, we had to sit down with her and explain budgeting, buying NEEDS vs WANTS, and look at regular bills (mortgage, utilities, etc).  \n\n  We had her set aside a certain amount of cash, and said *\"That's your limit for restaurants & take-out!\"* b/c she would just charge these...and then wonder why her VISA bill was so high! \n\n   Luckily, my sister listened and DID stay on her budget, but not everyone will.", "I would give her a gift card for food and offer to help her apply to move to a senior apartment to reduce her cost of living. Either she has to take accountability and sort out her finances alone or she has to accept you taking over her finances and having control over making sure the basic bills are paid first. Potentially a social worker and a medical evaluation could help too because reckless spending can be an early sign of some neurological disorders", "She could just be taking out so many fast loans from loan sharks or not know how to handle credit cards and is buried under a mountain of unnecessary debt.\n\nMy mom makes decent money and could live a (not-rich) but comfortable  lifestyle. However, she has this poverty mindset from her childhood so she keeps taking out loans for NO REASON, when she could easily pay for whatever she wants outright. \n\nShe lives under chronic stress and financial instability...like a pauper FOR NO REASON while credit companies make bank on people like her.\n\nPeople like that don't think long term and get too embarrassed to ask for help until it's too late.. .which I think is what is going on with your MIL.", "She\u2019s may be giving her money away to someone as an act of charity. I was giving my grandma $500/month. She would subsequently turn around and give her \u201cfriends\u201d(predators preying on elderly) gifts of $100-500 to \u201chelp them out.\u201d I quit giving her the money and all those parasites disappeared from her life. It made her feel good to \u201chelp people out.\u201d Your MIL may be in a similar position, giving her money away then fleecing you into bailing her out every time.", "Don\u2019t give her any more money if she refuses to tell you why she needs so much so often.", "If she won\u2019t tell, then I would absolutely not give her money. That kind of secretiveness with no sign of where the money goes suggests some kind of addiction (e.g. drugs, gambling) or a person repeatedly falling for scams."]}
