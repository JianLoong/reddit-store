She does have income and with our help she should be comfortable enough. My husband is quite upset with her as well and he agrees with me.

If you can afford it you can help her out of kindness (but you are not obligated) and tell her that you only keep on helping her if she shows all of her spendings to you even the last cent she spends. \n\nIt's possible that secretly she's helping somone, or that she is addicted to something etc. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Maybe you should look closer at her finances. How is she throwing money away like that?", "Gambling it's gambling", "NTA. If your mom lives comfortably with the same amount of money, your MIL can\u2019t handle money. I wouldn\u2019t pay for that either. Actually I wouldn\u2019t even pay for her food etc. Simply get her some course on how to handle your finances. Supporting parents/in-laws if they really need the money is absolutely the right thing but that woman is just wasting your money (for your retirement\u2026)", "NTA. If she asks again, tell her you will only consider helping if she is honest about the debts and provides you with receipts. It sounds like she needs to be forced into honesty about some part of her life that is problematic and either an addiction or a scam. So you guys may want to try to formulate a plan to intervene, but one that doesn\u2019t necessarily involve you solving her debt problems by just paying them off for her, but instead figuring out what they are and assisting her in resolving them herself by helping her face/stop her behaviour and come up with a plan to tighten her belt.", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you and you are letting her do it. Stop enabling her and make her pay all her bills.", "She wouldn't tell. Doesn't seem she is buying much stuff. Not living fancy either. It's all the same vague explanation she is short. We got a suspicion that there might be a gambling problem, but nothing that would prove it, and it's not like we would hire PI to figure this out.", "I have no idea. No medical issues we would know about. She is fairly active and seems to be feeling well. No fancy things at the house. She wouldn't tell, and math is not adding up.", "We asked not to borrow from anyone else and come to us when she is short. It is not a problem to give her 200-300 hundred when she is short, but suddenly, there is 1k+ debt from somewhere it gets overwhelming. Ar the end of the day, it is us who end up paying anyways.", "NTA then. I am also kind of supporting my parents now (paying their monthly bills and 50% of food) and while I don't mind giving them money to spend on wants; I expect transparency on how it is being spent if I do ask. \n\nA little $50 or $100 once a week is all cool. But seems like your MIL's antics is getting form bad to worse and affecting your family's finance. Your husband (and to that extend, your family) is not her retirement funds.", "She won\u2019t tell means you won\u2019t pay. NTA.", "Thank you. I realize now this is exactly what is bothering - lack of transparency. She owes us some honest answers."]}
