Nothing in the house belonged to one person, everything we brought had to be shared. For example if someone went to a restaurant and brought home leftovers anyone in the house could claim them. If me or a sibling got a new toy the other sibling had every right to play with it. When I was younger I didn\u2019t mind so much but now that I\u2019m 22, I just want some things for myself. When I started dating my boyfriend Mikey and he and his parents found out about this rule they let me store stuff I didn\u2019t want to share at their house. While it is a bit inconvenient it\u2019s better than being forced to share everything. \n\nIt was my birthday and Mikey and I were celebrating with my parents. For my birthday he brought me 6 specially decorated cookies. When my father saw he said \u201cI can\u2019t wait to try those, go ahead and pass them out.\u201d Mikey replied that those are for me and he brought everyone else some of the same cookies just not decorated. Well, my parents didn\u2019t want those they wanted the ones made specifically for me. When I refused to give them out my mom said if I didn\u2019t want to share then I needed to get them out the house. At that my boyfriend and I packed my cookies plus the regular cookies and went to his house. \n\nLater that day I get a text from my sister saying that not wanting to share cookies is a stupid hill to die on and I need to do something to make up for it. My brother understands that I didn\u2019t want to share but said it was my fault for celebrating with them when I know how they are. Mikey and his parents say I didn\u2019t have to share and did nothing wrong. \n\nI feel like an a hole for straining my relationship with my parents over something so trivial and maybe I should have just shared. There were 6 total and I would have still had 4 if I gave some to my parents.", "created_utc": 1678651062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11po42b/aita_for_not_sharing_cookies_with_my_parents/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was really struck by the comment you mentioned where if somebody had brought home take out, then it was for everybody. It seems like there are boundary issues, being that you are not allowed to set any. I understand wanting to share things but your family was definitely out of line, you shouldn\u2019t have to share your special birthday treat from your awesome boyfriend, who took the time to also get them cookies to feel included. \n\nWishing you lots more cookies for yourself, OP and none for your fam \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - time to move out. \n\nSharing is cool but this is aggressive.", "NTA - It's obnoxious that your dad basically said \"I can't wait to eat your birthday gift, hand it over\".    And there were cookies for them but they wanted YOUR special cookies.    I agree with the others,  I hope you can move out soon.", "NTA.  Sounds like your parents have set up a commune, not a family home.\n\nSharing is good but there is nothing wrong with establishing boundaries and having some things to call your own.\n\nUnfortunately, it really seems like you are going to have to set and enforce boundaries, not just over cookies, but over life in general, and I don't know how you can really do that without moving out.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t trivial.  You\u2019d shouldn\u2019t have to share a special birthday gift.  They are immature for kicking you out and demanding you give up a particular present when they were offered something else.  what a ridiculous family", "NTA.  What a ludicrous rule.  I'm having a hard time grasping the sheer level of entitlement that your family thinks they get to share your BIRTHDAY GIFT simply because it's physically present in their house.\n\nGet. Out. Soon.", "NTA\n\nYour parents have a real issue.  You are allowed to have things you don\u2019t want to share,  \n\nGood luck getting out of that home.", "NTA.  Your parents are insisting on an unreasonable lack of boundaries.  It\u2019s not healthy to not be allowed to have anything that is just your own.  If anyone is making this a stupid hill to die on, it\u2019s your parents.  Your boyfriend made you a sweet gift, and was considerate enough to make enough cookies for everyone.  But no, they *have* to have the pretty ones that were specially decorated for you.", "NTA\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Sharing husbands too ? Sharing weddings? Sharing bills? Sharing debt? Sharing hospital expenses? Sharing engagement rings? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMove out. ASAP.", "NTA. It's not trivial and it's not just about the cookies. The cookies were the last straw. Do all you can to save up and move out of there.", "NTA. \n\nIt makes me kind of sad that you never got to have anything special, just for you, while growing up. \n\nIt's okay to have some boundaries with people regarding some things. That doesn't make you a selfish person. \n\nA birthday gift from a boyfriend is absolutely something you have total decision-making control over. Even if you decide to keep them all for yourself? Not selfish.", ">Nothing in the house belonged to one person, everything we brought had to be shared.\n\nI'm just glad they didn't ask you to share your boyfriend.\n\nNTA\n\nSharing is great; entitlement is not.", "NTA. Sharing is caring, but not in this situation. You are not obligated to share everything. Your bf even went out of his way to buy similar cookies for them, but instead wanted yours? That\u2019s really strange to be honest. What was so special about yours than the other cookies?", "NTA  \nAnd clearly they wanted the cookies more because your boyfriend got them for you than because they wanted cookies if the non-decorated ones he got specifically for him weren't good enough  \nIf this incident was enough to strain your relationship, something tells me spending time with Mikey and his parents will open your eyes to more or your parents' & siblings' behavior that isn't exactly normal, this doens't feel like it's the only weird thing they do/expect and you may suddenly realize a weight has been lifted one you move out of there  \nHope you enjoyed every single bite of those cookies though!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to move out and have a lot less contact with your abusive AH parents?", "Nta but you need to move out", "NTA...  Time to get out.", "Time to move out. NTA.", "NTA what kind of weird commie garbage are your parents peddling? So u go out and buy something and your obligated to share it. That\u2019s so weird", "NTA. This kind of gets thrown around a lot around here, but this really does feel like like it was supposed to be some kind of power play.\n\n\u201che brought everyone else some of the same cookies just not decorated.

You\u2019re 22 the communal lifestyle is getting old.", "ETAH If your mom buys expensive make-up do you just go use it? Your special cookies should never have been in the house given the rules you live under. Move out, or pay rent and establish new rules.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sharing is only fine to a vertain point and your parents passed that point long ago.

You are not required to share your special birthday cookies with your parents and they are extremely selfish to insist after you expressed discomfort with the idea. Sharing is all good and well, especially to avoid fighting between multiple children, but that whole mentality hinges on respect and consent. You dont just take things, especially meaningful ones, ESPECIALLY if there is an alternative provided that is equivalent.", "NTA. I am the youngest of seven and we never had to share anything. I feel like your parents made this stupid rule to benefit from their children. I mean you have to share gifts. So people are buying gifts for the family? That is just weird and lazy parenting.

Move out.", "My dad was like this as a kid everything was for everyone but usually it just meant he'd eat all my food and not buy more. I got screamed at for writing my name on a specific box of snacks I got once since it was a seasonal thing and wanted to savor it. My older sister hid a big box of things in the closet with snacks. It's a stupid rule.

Of course, the plain cookies weren't good enough, so the parents wanted her birthday cookies.", "What is ETAH?", "If we got money we got to keep it, gift cards on the other hand, if someone else wanted to use it before the owner did we had to let them use it", "You're missing the point that it's free food.  Free!", "Exactly. I knew about the decoration on the cookies, but it\u2019s like despite that, what made them want hers than the others? Cookies are cookies ya know.
