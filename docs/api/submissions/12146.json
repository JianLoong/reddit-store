As such for the drive we each had our own coloring books and markers/pencils etc. Anyway we went to have lunch with my cousin I think and her children and as we were leaving her children started to just try to take our coloring books and use them. Obviously that upset us and my moms cousing started going off about how we need to share and it wasn't just ours. Thankfully my mom stepped in and shut that down.

So she loves getting something special and being able to share it with me.  I also will only nibble to show my appreciation and would never dream of taking it all. The act of sharing is a gift to bestow on others, not a command shoved down your throat.

Even if your bizarro family thinks that anything brought in by *their* money and effort are fair game, these cookies were a gift from your boyfriend. When he buys you a wedding ring, can your sister take that too? Heaven forbid you have a baby and bring it over, sis will steal it and raise it as her own.", "\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a\n\nNTA", "NTA. But, OP, it might be time to move out. I have a feeling just living with your family is really \"messing\" you up.

Were you at least allowed to have your own underwear?  Sheesh.\n\nYour boyfriend brought over cookies for everyone and a few fancy ones just for you because it was your birthday.  They were not entitled to your gift!  You offered them the regular ones that he'd brought for everyone to share.  What kind of jerks won't let their kid have their special birthday cookies without demanding to share?\n\nNTA\n\nI'm so sorry you have to deal with this crap.  Your boyfriend's parents sound like nice people.  I'm glad you have a nice set of parental figures in your life who encourages you to actually enjoy your own things without being forced to share everything.", "Total NTA.  This is bizarre, and it seems at least borderline abusive to not let you really own anything.  Your boyfriend sounds like a keeper, your parents, not so much.  Is this really the hill your parents want to lose their daughter on?", "NTA. This sounds like hell.\n\nBought something for your work/school lunch tomorrow? Nope somebody ate it just cause it was there.\n\nBought a new game you can\u2019t wait to get home to play?  Sorry someone already unwrapped it and is playing it now you\u2019ll have to wait until they get bored to have a turn of the game you paid for.\n\nThat dress you\u2019ve bought for a date? Yeah that\u2019s in the wash because someone wore it and spilled tomato sauce all over it, oh yeah that might stain huh. \n\nFoooork no. I\u2019d be out so fast the door would be sporting a cartoon silhouette", "Boyfriend understood the assignment, specially decorated bikkies for you and plain ones to share. Your parents are just plain greedy bullies at this point. NTA", "OP, NTA, I don\u2019t know how to say this the right way, with a correct psychological diagnosis but your family sounds pathologically crazy, I mean I kind of saw  their point of view  until they said that leftovers didn\u2019t belong to anyone. That\u2019s stealing. If they were my family I would probably be gently leading them to therapy or teaching them boundaries, maybe I am wrong, but you don\u2019t have to share every darn thing. Somethings can just be for you, I think like definitely leftovers, that definitely belongs to the person who bought the food. You can share if you want but it doesn\u2019t belong to you?!  That\u2019s crazy?!!!! NTA. P.S. Your parents are straining your relationship!

Like, \"yeah, there's other cookies for all of us but the ones that are special for you, I want those instead!\" \n\nI kind of wonder if her grandparents used to buy her dad a gift on his siblings' birthdays...", "That took a wild left turn \ud83d\ude02", "YES!!!
