We still travel every year and it became even more special now, because we don't get to stay together as much as we used to, so we use this time to be together.\n\n2 years ago, two of my father's aunts asked where we were going on vacations that year and they would tag along, because out trips look like fun. We are caught by surprise, but my mother gives them the whole intinerary, they end up tagging with us the whole trip and being a nuisance, asking me to carry things around, they don't speak english and don't even try, so they order me around so I get stuff done for them. It was the worst experience, but eventually ended and we joked that would never have other people come along...\n\nLast year, my uncle (her brother) asked if he could travel with us on our next vacation, because it looked fun (yeah, you know where this is going).\n\nThis time it was worse, we get individuals rooms, but this time, I had to share the room with my uncle so he could save some money. I live alone, so I'm not used to share a house with someone, even worse a room.\nSame communications issues and some personality ones, they end up fighting from time to time (siblings, you know right), by the end of the trip I told my mother that it's okay if she wants to travel with whoever she wants, but I'm not up to it and would pass next time.\n\nThis year we are planning a cruise trip and some time in Europe. On thurday she told she had paid her part on the travel agency and I could send them the money to cover my part. When I talk to them, they ask if I'm Anon or Anon's Uncle.\nMy mother had invite my uncle to travel with us again, after knowing that, I said that something came up and would call another day to finish the payment.\n\nToday I called my mother and told her that I'm not paying and won't travel this year, because I don't want to repeat the same experiencie from last year. She started crying, saying he invited himself again, and she couldn't say no, but this time would be different, because in the cruise each one can do whatever they want.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to waste my vacation (the only time of the year I'm off work and can enjoy doing things that I like or just relax) traveling with someone I dislike and I feel even worse because she didn't even told me, I found out because the agency guy asked me who I were.", "created_utc": 1675618792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uib2d/aita_for_bailing_on_a_trip_with_my_mother_because/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP's refusal to pay Uncle's way might resolve that part of the problem immediately - Uncle might drop out when told he has to pay for himself and then OP can go after all.

Don't.\n\nHe is an adult with a life of his own.  He could probably find a woman to go with him, if he tried.  According to reddit, lots of women are willing to put up with a guy's idiosyncrasies in order to have a companion.\n\nDon't give in to this malarkey, or you will be going on vacation with these people forever.  *Your mother changed the parameters of the trip by telling uncle that he could go.  You are no longer obligated to go along, or pay for it*. \n\nIf your mother can't cancel the reservations that she may have made for you she can probably find another relative eager to go.\n\nOr, she could try to find someone uncle might like to go with them.\n\nActually, OP, you need to tell her that you are lonely for her exclusive company.

It is not a good idea to share with your Uncle unless you can swim really well because I guarantee you will want to jump overboard.", "NTA. Your mom *could* have said no. You said \"no, *if*\" last year and the year before it was even both of you swearing you'd say no next time. She's had two chances to practice. She was there when you said it , she heard it, and she decided to say yes. That's her choosing your \"no\". Don't back down. It sounds like you are the one bearing the majority, if not the total, of the inconvenience and extra physical, emotional and mental labour on these vacations and if you let your mom guilt you out of a decision she knew damn well would result from her \"yes\" you'll be teaching both her and your uncle that you can be emotionally manipulated into a \"vacation\" where the quality of your time is lowered in order to increase the quality of others.\n\nUnfortunately if she can't learn to say no then this may be the end of your vacations with mom. But I would encourage you to try something new this year, since mom is out - try going somewhere you've always wanted to go by yourself so you can do what you want when, or find a travel group that consists of like gender or age or type of travel or whatever and make new friends. Or break your budget up and take mini vacations around your own local area, visit places you've never been to despite living nearby, or check out a nearby province, state whatever, or spend a weekend in a big city shopping or in a quiet cabin in a forest or by the waterfront.", "NTA one of the greatest freedoms in the world is traveling solo.

Sure you won't spend much time in the room but you will never be at peace knowing you have no private space at all.  Considering last time your mom didn't share her room I'm betting she'd expect you and uncle to share a cabin on the cruise as well.\n\nAlso note your mom is at least a little manipulative to try and get you to pay without mentioning this and clearly basically planned to spring your uncle on you despite you clearly communicating where you stood on that front.  Was probably hoping you wouldn't find out until literally on the cruise so that refund was impossible and she could just say \"well you're here and the moneys spent so just make the most of it.\"  \n\nHonestly I wouldn't feel bad because you set a boundary she decided her inability to say a TWO LETTER Word, took priority over your boundaries.  I know some people have a hard time saying no but those who use it as an excuse to ignore other peoples boundaries tend to end up very unhappy in a lot of their relationships.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy your solo vacation and perhaps next year mom can grow a spine.", "NTA for not wanting to waste your vacation. You tried it, didn't like it, and don't want to repeat it. You are the sane one.", "Let your mom know that you want alone time with her and that is the only reason you are going on the trip. If you don\u2019t skip this trip, you will always end up going with someone else whom you don\u2019t want to go with. Mom is too weak to say no to the others so unless you hold your ground, this will be repeated every year.", "So much easier to get away on a boat in the middle of an ocean and sharing a tiny stateroom! /s"]}
