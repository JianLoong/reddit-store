So people can go through to get from slides on both areas. \n\nI had already gotten my sons shoes on so he was just walking around the area kind of upset that we had to go and stop playing. I go to get my shoes and this girl who is probably 9/10 comes running through the area and knocks my son to the ground, hard. He is now in tears and without even thinking I pick him up and raise my voice \u201cstop running!\u201d She did apologize so I didn\u2019t continue talking to her I just wanted to make sure he was ok. Which he wasn\u2019t he busted his lip open. \n\nAfter we calm him down a little bit a lady comes over (I think her grandma) and asks if I just yelled at a girl. I said \u201cuhh yah I raised my voice and told her to stop running because she plowed my 2 year old son to the ground\u201d\n\nThen she went on some rant about how the \u201cappropriate thing\u201d would have been to come find the girls parents and talk with them instead of yelling at her and what I did was awful. I was ready to go as my son was still crying and just said \u201cok then, we\u2019re leaving bye\u201d. And she just continued to basically imply I was a bad father. And I just didn\u2019t engage my older two kids I knew were watching.\n\nMy wife thought I shouldn\u2019t even have engaged but I was so outraged that she even came over to talk to me as if I was in the wrong. Perhaps the appropriate thing to do would be to teach your daughter to not run in a place that has signs all over about not running and especially through areas where people are sitting. \n\nI had a bunch of \u201cwish I said this\u201d scenario in my head but AITA for raising my voice at this kid?\n\nEDIT: Let me clarify.

All you said was stop running, which is appropriate. \n\nGrandma got a bit too defensive here.", "NTA. You raised your voice in a situation that required it.

I would bet that that lady wasn't even related to the girl, just your classic \"old lady looking for a reason to complain\".", "NTA. I find it ironic that her grandmother didn\u2019t try to find your parents? After all, she shouldn\u2019t be disciplining someone else\u2019s child. Talk about a hypocrite!! /s. But in all seriousness, you did nothing wrong. Your main focus was your children and someone else hurt your child. Your reaction was appropriate.", "NTA she mowed him down it\u2019s called a reaction. I\u2019d tell Granny you wouldn\u2019t have to raise your voice if her family had taught her basic manners! What a witch!", "NTA. Kid should learn to not run in a place with signs saying no running. Grandma needs to chill and teach her grandkid some manners.", "NTA. This may sound harsh, but I don't give a single fuck about politeness or feelings when physical safety is concerned lol. She needed to stop running NOW, not after you mosey over to a defensive grandma and debate about her behavior", "NTA - you didn't lecture the kid, you didn't swear at her, you just told her to Stop Running in an area she shouldn't have been running in.  It's not always possible to follow a kid back to their parent/guardian, and most of the time those assholes just defend their precious little \"angels\" any way. (not to mention how someone might perceive a grown man following after a young girl). You didn't do anything wrong, as it's not your fault where the business put the locker area, although it would be a good idea to keep your kiddo closer to yourself maybe.", "NTA\n\nIt was fast, the kid apologized, WTF with this lady coming at you.  You said nothing inappropriate.", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing.  Anyone would.\n\nThe kid needs to learn to be more careful and the parent needs to be more conscientious.", "NTA for raising your voice, you were caught up in the moment with concern for your injured lad--any parent  would have done that.

She didn't deserve any more of your precious energy.  Hope the boy is feeling better.", "You are not the asshole.

Grandma is an AH, as soon as she saw your son was hurt and upset she should have apologised and backed off. \n\nHope little man is ok now.", "NTA. If a parent wants to be involved in every interaction, they need to be supervising closely enough to proactively be there, not expect other people conducting their own lives to go out of their way to find the parent. A kid was doing something dangerous. A parent or supervising adult wasn't close enough to stop it themselves, so you intervened as a community member to improve safety. If grandma wasn't close enough to actually hear you yelling, she wasn't close enough to have an opinion on this situation.

At these places, it may be your job to tend to your kid, but everyone should be making sure that everyone is staying safe. If my child was acting inappropriately (and running through that kind of area is inappropriate), I would expect other parents to correct him.  It was grandma\u2019s job to be monitoring the kid and she should have apologized to YOU for failing to do so and thanking you for correcting the kid.  Frankly, you showed WAY more restraint with grandma than I would have.", "NTA.

If the kid fell down a sewer and was holding on with a hand, do you help the kid or go looking for the parents.  Those that can't care for their kids so often deflect by telling others not to yell at their kids.  Sort of code for don't let anyone else know I wasn't paying attention and I got to cover and project the fault on the victim.", "NTA. I would have have said the exact same thing, and then reiterated to the guardian that her inability to control the child's behavior (running where she shouldn't) is on her.

If you don't want other people raising their voices at your kids, then actually parent them yourself!", "Going against the grain but a soft YTA for yelling at a child. Soft, because it is understandable that you want to mind your son, but not right at the same time.\nA grown man, especially one the child doesn't know, shouldn't yell at them. It would have been fine to quietly and calmly ask the her to stop running and explain why, but you probably frightened her - as adults we often forget our size and authority can be overwhelming - and she may have been in tears afterwards. Think of how you would react if you were the parent or guardian under those circumstances.\nAlso, it is a child's play place - and even though you may look your toddler in relation to the size of a 9 or 10 year old and forget that she is only a child too, no matter how large she seems in comparison to your son. And in a child's play place, all kids are full of the joys of life and rambunctious. So go easy. Teach, don't berate.\n\nRead this again when your toddler is 9 or 10 and you might see it from another perspective.", "Oh good, you're the parent awesome; key me go ahead and press assault charges then since my kid was injured and it's your kid's fault\n\nNTA", "NTA. A 9 or 10-year-old kid is much bigger than a 2-year-old toddler. She ran him down & drew blood. You yelling at her makes the situation even; the girl didn't even cry.

She was excited and running around, in a place designed for kids to run and play. Of course she should have been more aware of her surroundings, but she\u2019s a child. \n\nI also totally understand why your gut reaction was to raise your voice a bit, when your small child was just slammed into the ground hard enough to cause injury. \n\nI also understand why grandma was upset. I\u2019m imagining, based on personal experience, that the girl just stared at you in quiet terror, then went and started sobbing to grandma that a grown man just yelled at her. You probably scared her, and of course grandma got defensive. \n\nWhen I was about 8, I was in a crowded pool and bumped into another girl. A giant grown bearded man turned around and shouted at me, admittedly more aggressively than it sounds like you did. I ran out of the pool and sobbed to my parents, and was too scared to go back in the pool all day.

What you did was the least interaction in the situation.", "Sometimes I'll stop my walks and go talk to small children I see outside alone. I've always found the parents quickly enough, just out of my sight lines, but I'm always concerned that the day I don't, one of those kids will wander into danger unattended.", "Years ago we had to call the police because there was a naked toddler playing in the street. Dad stood in the street so she wouldn't get hit by a car while we waited, and I had to call my work to say I was going to be late.\n\nThe mother figured out who called and came to our door yelling and screaming and threatening us. But like... she didn't answer her door when he knocked and didn't notice the kid was missing for an hour."]}
