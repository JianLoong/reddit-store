I also have an ex gf/fianc\u00e9 \u201cMarisa\u201d(30), we we\u2019re together for 6 years, engaged for 10 months. But we broke it off due to some fundamental differences that we couldn\u2019t work on or see past.\n\nMy family got on with Marisa but my mother loved her and was devastated when we split and tried to get me to just ignore some of my beliefs and views and stay with her. It\u2019s been 5 and a half years since we split and since then my mother has invited her to almost every family event. I didn\u2019t really care and when I explained the situation to Max prior to his first family event and he was fine with it.\n\nHowever when I started bringing Max around things changed. Marisa would be sat next to me, normally with max in the other side, then he would be asked to get something from the kitchen and a kid would take his chair and when he came back my mother and some of my aunts would just tell him to swap with the kid since they obviously miss their uncle (me). Leaving me sat with Marisa at almost every family gathering. When I tried to point this out I was told I was being paranoid and rude to Marisa.\n\nWell last week I came home for Christmas. We are staying at my grandparent\u2019s house since they have a big house and so are some of my family, and Marisa. Normally she only comes for Christmas eve Day but this year my mother had invited her for the whole holiday. Max almost never gets jealous but the thought of having her here the entire time even made him uncomfortable. But again when I brought it up I was told the same thing, as well as that max was being over possessive and crazy.\n\nWell today everyone was out of the house doing things except me and max. So we did what you would expect a couple who hasn\u2019t been able to do anything too intimate (this included kissing because it made my mother \u201cuncomfortable\u201d) for a while would do. We triple checked that no one was home, calling out to anyone in the house because the last thing we wanted was a sick kid left home to walk in, but we were clear or we thought and went at it.\n\nWell about an hour ago I found Max crying, I comforted him and asked what was going on. He told me that Marisa was still in the house when they did it and had recorded the audio of that as well as had some audio recordings of him during one of his online therapy appointments and was basically calling him a disgusting person, accusing him of being the reason we broke up and saying he manipulated me.\n\nShe specifically went for things she knew were weak spots for him (which she knew from listening in to his session) and called him pathetic when he broke down, threatened him if he told me then Left. I am fuming. My family are not back yet but I want to go off on her and my mother, and honestly all of them for enabling this behaviour. So WIBTA if I did?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: i have a friend who lives near my grandparents, she's away now but has said me and max cant stay at hers for a while while we sort things out, she has asked her house sitter to drop by and give us the keys, we are packing our stuff right now and I'm taking us there. then I'm gonna order take out and some of max's favourite food. then I'm sending my parents a text that Marisa has crossed a line and that i cant be in the same house as her. and that i want her gone, i will come back tomorrow to talk to them (just me). I'm gonna be spending tonight with Max and making him feel better, because while i have tried to push back against this behaviour in the past, i just wanted to keep the peace and didn't do enough.", "created_utc": 1670760654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zipk13/wibta_if_i_went_off_on_my_family_during_the/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She might have always been their agent and that was her mission.\n\nEven if she were acting alone and of her own volition, that is still something she intends to use as a wedge between you and your bf/family so it might be wise to play it cool and try to figure out which before saying or doing anything.\n\nIf it goes smoothly just let it be and, on the way out, let your folks know that you won't be back if she's there.

Holy shit, I am petty as hell. \ud83e\udd23", "Reading your edit, I would just not subject Max to my family any more during this holiday season. I would go home\u2026 get some distance and deal with them then. This was horrible and traumatic. I don\u2019t think it can be fixed through just one conversation\u2026 or even over a few days. This feels like it needs weeks to months to resolve.\n\nObviously, YWNBTA.\n\nBest to you\u2026", "NTA. And this is where you just go home, and don't ever come back.   \nTell your mother that \"*You made it very clear that you did not love me as your son, you just loved me as someone who could spread your genes. I will have nothing to do with you anymore. Nothing at all*\".   \n\n\nTake care of that boyfriend of yours, he seems like a good  man.", "She secretly stayed in the house to spy on you both? And record your intimate moment AND Max's therapy session? And then threatened him??? What the everlivin' fuck???", "Dang! You nailed the \"christmas spirit\" everyone is bragging about without even trying. You're awsome. Sending all my good vibes for you to distribute around you.", "Sounds like OP finally got their head screwed on right, but it must have been an absolutely miserable thing for the BF to deal with for 5 years while OP was working on their spine.\n\nAlso in queer relationships, if you even suspect your fam is homophobic, you sit them down and hash out behavior expectations *before* bringing your partner around to stay with them.  If they can't promise to be civil, you don't bring them around.  \n\nQueer peeps have to deal with bs from literally just existing all the time, and to bring a partner into more hostile situations when it should be loving family is just wrong.\n\nESH except Max", "Finally! The award is for how long I had to scroll to find someone to point out how long it took for someone to point out how long it took for someone to point this out!", "Just call the police. Asking her to delete would get rid of the evidence.", "i honestly don't know, we called out and did quick sweeps of all the rooms.", "not the bedrooms, only the bathrooms.", "i live in the uk, so its not illegal to record someone without their knowledge or consent however i havnt been able to find clear answers if that applies to sexual recordings or private therapy sessions.", "\ud83d\udc9c As long as you are accepting of a whole lot of wholesome crazy people and copious amounts of pets, absolutely! \ud83d\ude0a", "That would have to depend on if therapy is considered a medical thing and therefore sharing patient information without consent would be illegal. IANAL but that might give you a place to start. Alternatively you could call whatever your equivalent of not emergency police contact line, and see if there is something you can do that way. Do consider she threatened him, which could be seen as blackmail. Technically she tried to threaten him with a recording she made of his private conversation with his therapist. That might get you further.", "It doesn't seem so simple. I googled a bit, found this: https://www.onlinespyshop.co.uk/uk-surveillance-law-the-essential-guide/ and I would assume that you could expect privacy there and I also found something else, where you can't record with malicious intent. I would try and find a lawyer or at least some free legal advice on the topic, this shouldn't go without consequences.", "I\u2019m not OP but would love to meet you, your wife, and the in-laws! You all seem to have giant, open hearts, which is something we need more of in the world. Blessings to you & yours and merry Christmas!\n\nedit:typo", "\ud83d\udc9c I understand! And I genuinely hope Max and you have a wonderful holiday season. You both deserve so more respect and love than you are being shown right now."]}
