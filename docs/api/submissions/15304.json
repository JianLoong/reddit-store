My sperm doner slept with his secretary (my mum) when she worked as his company. He was married at the time and had three kids. My mum got pregnant with me, sperm doner fired her and completely cut her off. He paid child support but it wasn't much and he was never involved in my life.\n\nHe showed up when I was ten because his company took off, and he didn't want his past \"errors\" to taint his image. I was forced to spend time with him and his family, particularly his kids. His daughter Verity (24f) was awful.\n\nShe treated me like Cinderella most of my life. Always making snide comments about me or my family. Things like:\n\n\"Look at my dolls, (OP). All of them, all mine. You don\u2019t have dolls like mine, do you?\"\n\n\"Look at my ponies (OP). I have three, you don't even have one, do you?\"\n\n\"Look at my dad (OP). He loves me, not you. Why are you even here, (OP).Nobody likes you here. Nobody wants you here.\"\n\n\"I hate you, (OP). You\u2019re not my sister. You\u2019re nobody. Just an ugly girl without a proper family.\"\n\nShe once laughed at me with her friends until I cried. She'd make fun of my hair, my clothes, she'd call me ugly or a gold digger, she'd make up rumors or throw dirt in my food. She used to always tell me to \"go back to your mum, (OP) where you belong.\"\n\nI struggled to pay for school, she went to a prestigious university without the burdens of tuition.

I've rarely spoken to sperm doner since, but recently I've been getting daily calls from his office. I hadn't answered until three days ago, he said he needed to meet with me on something urgent, and initially I wasn't going to go, but he sounded strange so I went to his office yesterday.\n\nHe told me that his company was offering a six month internship for new graduates. In truth, that internship could be the key to me getting into a good university. It pays really well and ultimately paints a really good path for my future. But I'd have to work with sperm doner, Verity and his sons. \n\nI told him that I didn't need him or his charity, that he could take his internship and stick it because he was a lousy excuse for a man and his family were the worst people I'd ever met. I don't regret it. He's never apologized for anything he's ever done to me or my mum. I'm a charity case for him, nothing more. But this opportunity is huge, and I'm conflicted over whether I'm making the right choice here.
