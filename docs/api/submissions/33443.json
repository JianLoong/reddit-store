Her flight was scheduled to get back at 7:40pm Sunday night. On Sunday I went to dinner at my parents house and was going to go directly from dinner to pick her up. \n\nDuring dinner I was checking her flight status to make sure I was going to be on time. The last I checked was at 7pm and it said her flight was going to arrive at 7:28. At 7:12, as I was leaving to go to the airport, I got a text from my girlfriend saying she landed, followed by a text asking why I was still at my parents house. I said I was just leaving and would be there in about 35 minutes. She texted back and said she was \u201cso fucking pissed\u201d, and \u201cdon\u2019t bother, I\u2019m going to get an Uber\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s extremely irresponsible\u201d, \u201cyou better have a damn good excuse\u201d\u2026 to quote a few of the texts I got on the way to the airport. \n\nAnyway, she ended up having to wait about 15 minutes for me to get her. She says that she shouldn\u2019t have to wait to be picked up at the airport and that I should have given myself more time just in case her flight was earlier. To me, I don\u2019t understand why I should have to be the one to wait in the cell phone lot, especially when I\u2019m doing a favor (which she says me taking her to the airport and picking her up is not a favor, just something I should do). In my opinion, for a flight that landed 16 minutes before the flight tracking said it would, waiting 15 minutes is not that bad and should be understandable. \n\nBut let me know if I\u2019m wrong! She said she talked to people about it and they all say she\u2019s right\u2026 and I don\u2019t like talking about relationship issues with people that know both of us.

A 15-minute wait isn't going to kill anyone. Your girlfriend sure has a flair for the overly dramatic. You need to ask yourself if this is really something you want to deal with for the years to come. Hardly your fault that the airline schedule didn't reflect an early landing.", "NTA. You were checking the time and going off the information you had available to you. \n\n>\u201cso fucking pissed\u201d, and \u201cdon\u2019t bother, I\u2019m going to get an Uber\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s extremely irresponsible\u201d, \u201cyou better have a damn good excuse\u201d\u2026 \n\nBut if anyone talked to me like this, I would have let them take that uber and would rethink the relationship.", "Hmmm, I see you just checked your phone instead of your crystal ball. If you had (responsibly) checked your crystal ball then you would have known that the flight was going to get in EARLY!! Ask your girl friend what form of witch craft she would suggest next time so as to clear up this issue. NTA", "NTA. She sounds a little unhinged tbf. 15 minutes is not that long to wait especially since she landed early.", "NTA. A 15 minute wait at the airport is not that unreasonable. You kept tabs on her flight time, but the flight tracker was wrong. Her flight was early. It seems she texted you while she was still in the plane, but she was already mad that you weren't ready to pick her up? Did she just magically get from her seat to curbside, with her luggage? She seems pretty ungrateful, and I would be hesitant to take her to the airport in the future.", "NTA. But her nasty texts make we wonder how often she pulls crap like this. If someone were kind enough to do me the favor (in a world of buses, subways and Ubers, yes it's a favor) of picking me up at the airport, I would never harangue them like this. Most times it's at least 10 or 15 minutes after landing before you're even off the plane anyway. I really kind of hate that she did the \u201cdon\u2019t bother, I\u2019m going to get an Uber\u201d when in fact she was NOT going to get an Uber; she was going to wait there for you to show up to probably throw more verbal abuse your way.", "INFO: why did you still go & pick her up when she was that rude to you? Especially given that she suggested an Uber. \n\nAny partner talking to me like that would be encouraged to get their own Uber home.", "Waiting 15 minutes to get picked up from the airport is mildly annoying, at worst. Her being \"so fucking pissed\" is quite the overreaction.\n\nALSO!\n\n\"She said she talked to people about it and they **all** say she's right...\"\n\nYeah, I highly doubt this. NTA", "NTA, if someone picks you up for free, and you have to wait for a few minutes, there is no reason to complain. Does she do this often?", "Nah, she ain\u2019t the one. \n\nNTA", "NTA - next time she can take an Uber", "NTA - and here\u2019s the thing we ALL HAVE BEEN THROUGH way more often:\n\nYou arrive on time to pick someone up and wind up waiting 35-minutes to an hour because:\n\nA) plane landed late\nB) traffic on the runway\nC) baggage carousel took an eternity\nD) \u201csorry! Got lost in Starfleet HQ - i mean - the terminal!\u201d As in airports are huge and easy to get lost in.\n\nMy point is it\u2019s WAY more common for the person driving to the airport to arrive om time but wind up standing there like a Justin Beiber groupie at the backstage entrance anyway.", "NTA, but you would be one if you stayed with this chick. It sounds like she is willing to manipulate the story to her friends so she doesn't seem like the bad guy. You did nothing wrong. If I knew the flight would land at 7:40, I would check its status at 7, but also at 6 and 5 just to make sure it's not early.\n\nSomething else doesn't add up - unless there's like 2 airplane gates at the airport, it takes a hell of a lot longer than 15 mins to get out of an airport. But still all the same, NTA. Dropping off and picking up your S/O is typical of a long-term BF/GF relationship, but it should not be expected.", "NTA.  The correct response here is: \n\n\"I've got hairy balls, not crystal balls\"", "NTA. Where's the \"thanks, honey\"?  Picking people up from the airport adds a commitment to your day that essentially limits it. It's a nice gesture to pick someone up; where's the gratitude? A simple thanks would be nice", "Nta she's being over dramatic. 15 minutes, boohoo. When someone is nice enough to pick you up for the airport, you say thank you.", "NTA - you did your job. You watched her flight, you left on time. You can\u2019t help that her flight was early. Good grief, such a choosing beggar!", "Nta. If someone does me a favor I don\u2019t complain", "Fine, take an Uber. See you in a couple of days...maybe", "NTA. Run. Or fly.", "Leave her. She is not nice to you.", "NTA Once that texts started getting nasty I'd have turned around and let her take an uber. Verbal abuse is not ok.", "If I was a dick to my wife because I had to wait 30 minutes or less after my flight landed, I'd apologize later and say that I was wrong. She's the one putting in the half hour each way to come get me. Even if it is a bit inconsiderate, it's not a big deal. Your girlfriend needs to learn to choose her battles. My favorite quote goes something like \"you can tell the size of a person by the size of the things that bother him.\" I try to use that as a guide in all things.", "NTA, I would rather wait at the airport than have the person picking me up wait. You never know how long it\u2019ll take to deplane. I\u2019ve been on a flight that was only 40 minutes long and we landed early. It took 2 hours to deplane - not sure what the hold up was but I wouldn\u2019t want someone picking me up to also have to wait. \n\nFor trips in the future have your girlfriend drive and park or use Uber / Lyft since she expects immediate pick you up. FYI, if she parks her car and use shuttle she may have to wait 10-15 min for shuttle to come but it\u2019s no longer your problem. Also when you use Uber / Lyft it also may take 10-30 minutes to get one.", "NTA. She's probably in a bad mood and anxious to get home after traveling, but shouldn't take it out on you. You're not crazy, man.", "NTA\nShe has a phone, it can occupy her time. They she chargers if her battery was low.", "NTA - Had to wait 15 minutes...Boo Hoo; How Horrible!\n\nShe is unrealistic and an entitled brat. Perhaps her expectations are out of whack due to not traveling much.  Her texts to you are completely unacceptable. Do not tolerate being treated this way. Most people would be incredibly grateful to have curb-side pick-up at an airport within 15 minutes.", "NTA\n\nWhile I more or less agree with her that it really should not count as a favor 15 minutes is not a big deal especially given that you were at dinner with your parents and the online status was so far off. If you consider it a favor, both have a lot of things to talk about and may need some relationship counseling.\n\nShe did not speak to anyone who is impartial. It is likely she only spoke to her own cronies to validate her opinion.", "NTA. It was landing early by circumstance, and she wasn\u2019t waiting long.\n\nI have a bad feeling that people are agreeing with her just \u2018cause she\u2019s a girl >-<", "NTA.  Your girlfriend needs to learn how to say thank you.  Airport pickups are an even bigger favor than drop offs.  Next time let her wait for an Uber.", "Why is she making a big deal about it like you cheated or something \ud83d\ude02 I mean yeah no one wants to have to wait but it\u2019s not the end of the world lol", "Was she in a hurry?  15 minutes seems like pretty normal waiting for a ride at the airport time.", "NTA. Let her drive herself and pay for parking next time. 15 minutes isn't a big deal.", "NTA your gf seems like an entitled b\\*tch", "NTA", "NTAH, you should dump her", "I dont like your girlfriend very much.\n\nDo you? \n\nAre you commonly treated like trash in your relationship?", "NTA and your girlfriend seems very petty if she\u2019s now complaining to her friends about this. You were checking the flight and made decisions based on the information you had. Also, dropping someone off at an airport is a favour.", "Absolutely not the AH! \n\nYou had to drive 35 minutes each way X 2.\n\nThat's 2 hours and twenty minutes of your time you sacrificed for her and she couldn't even wait for 15 minutes???!!\n\nIf I was you I would have left her at the airport - she's so incredibly rude, disrespectful and entitled.", "nta at all", "Wtf. It was only 15 min. NTA.", "NTA. What a ridiculous expectation. I\u2019ve been married for many years, and I\u2019m just grateful when my spouse is able to come get me. Being angry at having to wait a few minutes is silly.", "NTA its not as if you were super late. She was early. She can't expect you to see into the future and know to sit there early. And I say this as someone who is almost always 15 minutes early.", "NTA. Picking up someone from an airport is a big ask. If she couldn't handle waiting 15 minutes for you to pick her up she can order an Uber, and likely wait 15 minutes for the Uber. \n\nBut you've learned a valuable life tip: No good deed goes unpunished when it comes to picking up people at the airport. You should always decline doing it.", "NTA... that was not a long time to wait and you were watching the tracker.\n\nThis is just the travel blues. If she keeps it up, suggest she arrange an uber next time.", "Absolutely NTA! Most airports near me have a parking/waiting charge if you get there early - much better for her to be waiting than for you to be. Also, you timed it pretty well if her flight hadn't landed early, which there's no way you could have known.", "You would be wrong if you stayed in a relationship with her. NTA.", "INFO\n\nIf it takes 35 minutes to get to the airport then why weren\u2019t you leaving around 7? It\u2019s weird to me that you are annoyed to have to wait in the cell phone lot but your girlfriend should have to suck it up and wait for you to pick her up after a day of traveling.", "NTA. Her reaction was out of line for a 15min wait.", "NTA - Hit her with the \"I'm sorry I didn't happen to get your text with the pilots phone number so he could tell me you guys were landing earlier\"\n\nPoor behavior from her, needs to learn that she asked someone a favor not summoned her fucking butler.", "NTA , she should've communicated with you.\nHow were you supposed to know?", "Slightly entitled, don't you think? So, in her eyes, things can't happen... I am sure she is perfectly perfect in all her ways all the time?", "NTA, but probably not the issue.\n\nShe may be blowing this one occurance up but it's probably something else that built it up and she's only now expressing it.\n\nDo you often not prioritize arriving places on time or early? Do you often have time blindness? Does she feel maybe you don't communicate enough to make her feel she's a priority?  If roles were switched, would she have done the same?  \n\nOf course her friends will agree with her, because likely she's not just sharing the scenario you just expressed but all the other examples that lead to this one thing becoming a big deal.\n\nAgain though - NTA, but rather than shifting that to meaning she is, just take a beat to zoom out and be sure it's not a bigger issue/red flag. I mean, it doesn't look great based just on the info here.\n\nOn another note, you also don't want to be TA that sits in the cell phone waiting area forever when there's a courtesy time limit.. Park somewhere 5 minutes away and wait for the \"I've landed/hitting customs/coming out\" text THEN pull up. Lol. \n\nBut yeah, when I first started dating my wife, I'd park, be at the gate with a gift, help with the bags. Now that we're older, she's grown past that type of stuff and would rather just be efficient and get home asap. I check google for the flight status and aim to arrive at least 10 minutes before she should be coming out the airport at our agreed spot.  The extra 10 minutes is so I can drive through some Starbucks or in case there's traffic.", "Waiting happens, especially when it comes to travel. someone always is going to have to wait, whether it be the person picking up or arriving. It is what it is. Not ideal for anyone.   \n\n\nYou're gf acting a bit entitled especially with her responses to you. I get she is mad and it is frustrating. Most people are tired and exhausted, so not surprising she would be upset. But she taken a bit too far with her responses, especially when she didn't have to wait too long either.   \n\n\nI am long distance with my partner and we know sometimes we have to wait.", "NTA\n\nPlanes can be early, on time, or late. \n\nLet's cross off planning on the plane being late, so that leaves planning to be there early or on time.  \n\nIf you plan on being there early, someone will be waiting in 2 of the 3 plane arrivals (early arrival is no wait; on time or late arrival is you waiting,  potentially for a long time). If you plan on being on time, then someone is still waiting in 2 of the 3 plane arrivals (if the plane is early she waits, if it's late you wait). That second (on time) plan balances the risk of waiting and reduces likelihood of anyone waiting the longest (early you arrival with late plane arrival). On time is the logical approach.\n\nBUT. Not everyone thinks logic applies here. I know some who feel that plane travel is just different and others need to shoulder some of the stress for the traveller. And, I know some who think that's especially true for women traveling and men picking up. \n\nIt's not really a question of who's the AH. The question is which is the base assumption between you two: logic & equality or chivalry  & women need extra help.", "Was this the first trip away in your relationship?  Could you have met her at the gate?  While I think she was over the top, this feels a bit like \"you didn't miss me\" energy.  And to be honest, your description of the day feels a bit like you didn't.\n\nIf she was expecting a romantic gesture, then you disappointed her.\n\nWhich doesn't make you an AH.  Just means that there was a mismatch in expectations and maybe some poor communication.\n\nMy wife's first business trip during our relationship was flowers at the gate (back when you could be at the gate).

But regardless, she is very much an ass for getting pissed he wasn't waiting with bated breathe for her to come strolling out of the doors.", "My flight last Saturday came in almost 30 minutes early.... I texted my dad from the plane (once we landed) that \"I think we took a shortcut...\" to give him a heads-up, then could take my time to get down to the baggage claim. Still ended up waiting a bit (mostly because my suitcase was one of the first ones off the plane), but hey, after taking two+ hours of public transportation in order to get to the airport that morning, a fifteen-minute wait was like nothing and the pick-up was very much appreciated.\n\nI do have to wonder what's with all of the early flights, though, because there were three more on just the same baggage carousel that were 15+ minutes early (I did not look at other carousels). Maybe airlines adding on time to their estimates in order to look good when they can say that they've arrived early?", "She's the type to expect him to be there an hour before waiting on her because \"he knew she'd be on the way.\" There was never going to be a correct time for OP to go unless he was already there, which is what she expects no matter what", "The girlfriend is the AH, get over yourself\u2026he is doing you a favor, plus he checked the app\u2026next time walk home brat", "He was supposed to circle the airport from the time he dropped her off until she got back!!", "I'm still processing her attitude.

It is like an accident happening during your commute. You couldn't leave earlier to avoid the accident as it hadn't happened yet. \n\nPlus those flight apps are only somewhat accurate and the timing can REALLY depend on the airport. My sister's flight landed 10 minutes early. But they had to wait for an open gate and then by the time she used the bathroom, picked up luggage, and then got outside for me to see her was 40 minutes (the wait for the gate was of that time).

It's delayed only a few seconds from real world (live under a landing pattern and I can literally look at my screen, then out the window). Generally speaking, it helps to also check Flight Radar or FlightAware for an ETA.\n\nHowever! Just because a plane lands, doesn't mean there is a gate open. I watched my parent's flight land last week, then move into a holding pen, since there wasn't an open gate for them to pull into. I'm only 10-15 minutes from the airport, so I don't leave until the plane is literally at the gate. It also depends on whether someone has checked bags or not. Checked bags take longer to get. It could be 20-25 minutes if someone checked their bags. No checked bags means the person's walking to the exit immediately. Depending on the airport, that could be 5 minutes or 15. You also have to contend with the other passengers. It can really be a crap-shoot in terms of how long it takes to get through.\n\nIt sounds like the girlfriend's flight landed early, had an available gate that was close to the pick-up area, and was able to get off the plane quickly.

Crap got that T-Shirt too.", "Assuming people aren\u2019t unemployed or just waiting around to see if their partner needs them, they have to make accommodations to pick someone up from airport. This guy could have spent more time with his parents if he didn\u2019t have to pick up his gf. Your world does not have to revolve around your partner 24/7", "Hahaha with his next gf, yesss", "Yes! With the times give here, my solution would be to text when the plane lands and then the one picking up can go. If the one being picked up has to wait 15 min, so what, they\u2019re being picked up, and it\u2019s probably quicker than taking the bus/train/whatever.", "Yeah exactly. Flight times change constantly, traffic, other things come up. It's life.", "Dear u/Ok_Caramel_1402,  \n\nYou've expressed this opinion twice, yet the percentage of people who agree with you remains nil. Do not attempt post this again, or you will be haunted by the ghost of the masturbatory self-righteousness, who will torture the souls of you and your loved ones with the curse of eternal tardiness to airport pick-up obligations.", "Which means you're also paying for parking. Good for you, I guess. Op planned to be on time, and would have been if the flight had landed as originally scheduled. So your \"not even bothering to come on time\" comment is completely unnecessary. The vast majority of people do not consider a 15 minute wait at an airport unreasonable.", "In this scenario you'd still be up to 8 min late picking up the gf, which is why OP is nta. (Scheduled landing 7:40, texts 'why at you're folks?' At 7:12, based on your habits your spouse would be waiting for 5-8 min. The point is, shit happens and you still should just appreciate your partner coming to pick you up. \n\nAlso, why wait 20 min when you can just do your best to arrive when they do? My husband travels for work constantly, I live a 15-20 min drive from the airport, it takes 15-20 min to land, de board and walk through the airport so I just wait until he texts me 'landed' to leave home. Most times we arrive within minutes of one another, sometimes he waits 5 min, sometimes I wait 5 min. \n\nThe difference is if he's waiting, he can just chill out, whereas if i'm too early, I either have to park at the cell phone lot 5 min away or just drive around and around as you're not allowed to stop at the arrival area. If I drive up and he's not quite there, it'll take me 5 min to circle around again. Fortunately, he values my time as equally as I value his so our system works for us.", "What country do you live in?  In the US, post 9/11, you don't get to greet people at the gate.\n\nYou're lucky if the cop doesn't fuss at you for waiting at the curb in your car for more than a minute or two.", "He wasn\u2019t late.", "Do you think passengers teleport off the plane to the pick up area as soon as the plane touches the ground?  That's not how it works.  It takes time to taxi to the gate, get off the plane, and walk to the pickup area.\n\nHe would have arrived at 7:50 for a plane that was scheduled to arrive at 7:40.  That's reasonable.", "He wasn\u2019t late.  He was on time.  She was early.  Learn2math.", "He did.  It\u2019s obvious to me an 43 other people that downvoted you who\u2019s doing the mental gymnastics and it sure as shit ain\u2019t me.", "\u2018The last I checked was at 7pm and it said her flight was going to arrive at 7:28.\u2019\n\n35 min drive, he should have left then", "I waited two and a half hours in line at LAX to just check in for my flight (which I missed \ud83d\ude44).", "Or equally plausible, her friends are just as shitty and entitled as she is.", "I talked to all my friends. They all say you should have been waiting. And you should have gotten a better car to pick me up. In fact, if you actually cared, you'd have rented a limo and hired a mariachi band to sing while you showered me with flowers.\n\nI swear, chivalry is dead.", "More likely she's doctored her side of the story to make him look like an asshole.", "Unless all of her friends are entitled brats like she is. They\u2019re like a cult.", "Came here to say the same thing", "Haha true, but I do think it\u2019s different to ask internet strangers than to create IRL drama.", " Sounds very mommy.", "Mmm, you right. I was just thinking of my usual dash to the trains at DIA, lol.\n\nAnyway, she's def the asshole. My boyfriend drives to pick me up from the airport way further than 35 minutes and idc if he's a little \"late\" and I have to sit for ten minutes in front of the pickup, lmao.", "Oh, I have found some very inexpensive flights from where I've been and needed to go into Dane County, lol. But I do know they can be wack, so I'll often just fly into Chicago and take the coach bus up! I have family that lives there and visit several times a year. I actually do love that airport and sometimes it's just less of a hassle to pay $40 more and not take the three hour bus from Chicago or Milwaukee.", "Yeah exactly. Further, on qantas which I normally fly, they have wifi (free or paid) on exactly zero of their planes. Even when I travelled overseas in business class.", "Who said they all do??", "Same this free shit is new to me", "Same and I fly all the time. Never ever seen free in flight WiFi.", "Most have free wifi texting capabilities but not internet.", "Never said that was the case.  However anyone counting favors like this is really quite an AH. I mean by this every act of kindness no matter how small is a favor to someone.  Me picking up things off the floor at a grocery store to put back on a nearby shelf is a favor to employees. There comes a point when you should not be viewing it as a favor of any real note.", "Same My SO has to fly out for work and back every 3 weeks. When he lands he's ready to go home not have a reunion in the airport. And sometimes I'm early and sometimes he waits.", "I understood that just fine. \n\nBut he hadn\u2019t even left at 715 and stated it was a 35 minute drive. So, considering he hadn\u2019t left yet, he would have still been late for an on-time arrival. \n\nYou see, that\u2019s how math works.", "Your all just focused on that her flight landed early. \n\nI\u2019m going by the original time. 712 + 35 gets you to exactly 747, which is AFTER the original flight time. But he hadn\u2019t left yet, so he still would have been late. Thats by his own numbers. (I did doing to 715 earlier but used his exact time of 712 here.)\n\nYes, she overreacted. I\u2019ve stated that. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he would have been late even for the original flight time. \n\nSome of you all need to learn how to do basic math apparently. \ud83d\ude44", "Or she lied to them to make her seem right.  Nta", "She\u2019s so high maintenance and unappreciative", "Fck that shit.  Who the hell is paying airport parking fees when we all know flights are far more likely to be delayed than are to be early.  She spoke to no-one.  I doubt she has friends.  She is a lying liar that lies.", "Is chivalry really dead or being killed. I noticed that for the past 5-10 years. When I hold the door open for certain women, they seem put off by it. I'm in my late 30s and was brought up to always be gentlemen, hold the door open, and give women the right of way. Most older women and senior citizens  seem to appreciate the gesture, thank me, when they walk by. But most younger women seem creeped out. Don't even say thank you or bother acknowledging the goodwill. I get better feedback from men when I hold the door open for them.  If I'm closer to the door and someone is a few paces behind, I think it's rude to just let the door close  in their face.  Sometimes, I wonder if I should just let the door close in their face and instead of creep them out.", "But your friends know the both of you and past situations/arguments. They'll know more details about this situation also. Idk, if I had a disagreement with someone, I'd talk to my friends about it first to see someone else's point of view instead of jumping straight to writing a post about it.", "Same here-- qatar, united, American business class doesn't have free wifi even for elite members. The msg alone plan is relatively low cost, I guess", "Some =/= most", "LOUD NOISES!", "I flew Delta to Vegas a few weeks ago and they had free wifi.", "I fly a stupid amt and have elite status on 4 airlines... wifi is rarely free. Maybe it's the carrier.", "We are not talking about the things you do for shared things, like keeping the house clean. If you are constantly obligated to do stressful tasks for your partner and they don\u2019t have to be grateful because \u201cthat\u2019s your job\u201d, it can get very tense. For people in Los Angeles, picking someone up from LAX is considered a saint\u2019s job. This weekend I took the bus out of the terminal just to spare my ride the pain of the horseshoe from hell. I can\u2019t even imagine having to force a partner to get me every time!", "Have you never flown before? It takes at least \\~15-20 minutes, if not more, after the plane lands to taxi to the gate, passengers to deboard, and then walk through the terminal to the pick up area.", "And as a result she would have had to wait 7 1/2 minutes. Meaning she would have only been half as mad\u2026..Which is still 100% more mad than she has any right to be.", "Do you think people teleport from their seat the moment they land to the curb outside the terminal?", "How long do you think it takes disembark, get your luggage, and get outside the terminal where passenger pickup is?  Even if she had a carry on, he\u2019s got more than enough time.  Not to mention, she landed 15 min early, she waited 15 min, does that sound like he would have been late.  It\u2019s not a word problem dude.", "Or they're so sick of her entitled shit that they just agree with her so she'll shut up and they can get on with their lives.", "Right? Can you imagine telling any normal person, I\u2019m so angry my boyfriend wasn\u2019t prepared for my flight to arrive earlier than scheduled and I consequently had to wait 15 minutes to be picked up! \nI\u2019m embarrassed for her.", "Bingo! This gets my vote.", "But she'd have to weave a pretty big lie. Even if the flight was on time and he'd arrived 15 minutes late (and not on time, which was the case), it's not that big of a wait considering she was getting a free ride.", "Why not both? They know what she\u2019s like and the story with a few omissions sounds much worse. \u201cHe was supposed to pick me up and when I landed he hadn\u2019t even left his parents house and I had to wait around for him\u201d is all _technically_ true and makes him sound awful while completely missing the important details that change everything.", "Who the fuck pays airport parking fees nowadays?\n\nThere's a thing called the cell phone lot. You wait there in your car until whoever you're waiting for calls you. Then you drive to the terminal.\n\nBut just in case it went over your head, my response was ironic hyperbole.", ">She is a lying liar that lies.\n\n<3", "Idk, my flight on Saturday arrived early. And I thanked my husband for picking me up, instead of griping that he wasn't there the second I walked off the plane. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don't think I've ever had someone upset that I held the door for them.", "Yeah, I tell women like that all the time \"You're RUINING everything for the rest of us.\" He does for me/I do for him. Give and take is a lost art but, believe me, beautiful manners are loved by most humans. And the one's who don't feel that way? Just let the door slam shut in their faces. Everybody's happy \ud83e\udd17", "I think a lot of women don't really understand why this is still a thing. If you'd hold the door open for anyone, great, do that. But if you're holding the door specifically for a woman, why? Are women less capable of opening a door themselves? I think in the past this kind of chivalry was accepted because women were seen as weaker and in need of protection, and a lot of women liked it too. But these days there's less place for it and the best way to show your respect for women is to treat them as equals, which means being equally polite to men and women.", "I would do neither. But I\u2019m especially not dragging my friends into something so mundane as I had to wait 15 mins at the airport don\u2019t you think my bf is a jerk? That\u2019s just people who love drama and affirmation, not people who are legitimately looking for advice.", "And your point? If someone is on an airplane that has in-flight texting capability, then they can use it to contact transportation on the ground. If it doesn\u2019t, then they can\u2019t. \n\nSeems pretty straightforward.\n\nRemember, the original comment said \u201cmost.\u201d", "Sorry, I don\u2019t understand your reply.", "Ok so it's one or two airlines and one carrier. This isn't most", "He didn\u2019t try to match it up though or he would have left when he saw the flight was early. He did not do this though. Hence my comment on his time management skills. \n\nI agree she needs to chill though.", "Several times a year actually. Thanks for playing.", "Or she was mad that he hadn\u2019t bothered to leave at all.", "And he knew almost 15 minutes before that, that the flight was early and still didn\u2019t leave. \n\nAbsolutely a first world problem. Never said it wasn\u2019t. I also never claimed she was being rational.", "Lots of possibilities.  None of which make OP the AH.", "That is such a good point. he got there exactly on time. she's the one that is early. dose she expect him to always anticipate when she's going to be early? by how much? always wait around a half hour for the off chance that she will be early? this makes her sound so nuts.", "Omg can you even believe he doesn\u2019t value me enough to even show up? I had to stand there. In the cold. I almost got *trafficked!* Like if my man isn\u2019t eager enough to see me again after TWO WHOLE DAYS AWAY to be waiting curbside with flowers and getting my suitcase is he *even* a *real* man? \n\nYou know it girlfriend.", "Not in my country.  But I get your hyperbole.  Edited comment.  We're a bit backwards here.", "It wasn't ironic.", "Weird take then. Bet you're one of those people that immediately stand up and crowds the aisle as soon as the seatbelt sign is turned off.", "You're not being rational, either.  OP had plans with his parents.  Why should he cut that short because her flight is early?  Normal people don't expect that.", "Definitely.  That commenter sounds insufferable.", "Hell no. I wait til the end."]}
