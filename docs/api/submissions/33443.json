Her flight was scheduled to get back at 7:40pm Sunday night. On Sunday I went to dinner at my parents house and was going to go directly from dinner to pick her up. \n\nDuring dinner I was checking her flight status to make sure I was going to be on time. The last I checked was at 7pm and it said her flight was going to arrive at 7:28. At 7:12, as I was leaving to go to the airport, I got a text from my girlfriend saying she landed, followed by a text asking why I was still at my parents house. I said I was just leaving and would be there in about 35 minutes. She texted back and said she was \u201cso fucking pissed\u201d, and \u201cdon\u2019t bother, I\u2019m going to get an Uber\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s extremely irresponsible\u201d, \u201cyou better have a damn good excuse\u201d\u2026 to quote a few of the texts I got on the way to the airport. \n\nAnyway, she ended up having to wait about 15 minutes for me to get her. She says that she shouldn\u2019t have to wait to be picked up at the airport and that I should have given myself more time just in case her flight was earlier. To me, I don\u2019t understand why I should have to be the one to wait in the cell phone lot, especially when I\u2019m doing a favor (which she says me taking her to the airport and picking her up is not a favor, just something I should do). In my opinion, for a flight that landed 16 minutes before the flight tracking said it would, waiting 15 minutes is not that bad and should be understandable. \n\nBut let me know if I\u2019m wrong! She said she talked to people about it and they all say she\u2019s right\u2026 and I don\u2019t like talking about relationship issues with people that know both of us.

A 15-minute wait isn't going to kill anyone. Your girlfriend sure has a flair for the overly dramatic. You need to ask yourself if this is really something you want to deal with for the years to come. Hardly your fault that the airline schedule didn't reflect an early landing.", "NTA. You were checking the time and going off the information you had available to you. \n\n>\u201cso fucking pissed\u201d, and \u201cdon\u2019t bother, I\u2019m going to get an Uber\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s extremely irresponsible\u201d, \u201cyou better have a damn good excuse\u201d\u2026 \n\nBut if anyone talked to me like this, I would have let them take that uber and would rethink the relationship.", "Hmmm, I see you just checked your phone instead of your crystal ball. If you had (responsibly) checked your crystal ball then you would have known that the flight was going to get in EARLY!! Ask your girl friend what form of witch craft she would suggest next time so as to clear up this issue. NTA", "NTA. She sounds a little unhinged tbf. 15 minutes is not that long to wait especially since she landed early.", "NTA. A 15 minute wait at the airport is not that unreasonable. You kept tabs on her flight time, but the flight tracker was wrong. Her flight was early. It seems she texted you while she was still in the plane, but she was already mad that you weren't ready to pick her up? Did she just magically get from her seat to curbside, with her luggage? She seems pretty ungrateful, and I would be hesitant to take her to the airport in the future.", "NTA. But her nasty texts make we wonder how often she pulls crap like this. If someone were kind enough to do me the favor (in a world of buses, subways and Ubers, yes it's a favor) of picking me up at the airport, I would never harangue them like this. Most times it's at least 10 or 15 minutes after landing before you're even off the plane anyway. I really kind of hate that she did the \u201cdon\u2019t bother, I\u2019m going to get an Uber\u201d when in fact she was NOT going to get an Uber; she was going to wait there for you to show up to probably throw more verbal abuse your way.", "INFO: why did you still go & pick her up when she was that rude to you? Especially given that she suggested an Uber. \n\nAny partner talking to me like that would be encouraged to get their own Uber home.", "Waiting 15 minutes to get picked up from the airport is mildly annoying, at worst. Her being \"so fucking pissed\" is quite the overreaction.\n\nALSO!\n\n\"She said she talked to people about it and they **all** say she's right...\"\n\nYeah, I highly doubt this. NTA", "NTA, if someone picks you up for free, and you have to wait for a few minutes, there is no reason to complain. Does she do this often?", "Nah, she ain\u2019t the one. \n\nNTA", "NTA - next time she can take an Uber", "NTA - and here\u2019s the thing we ALL HAVE BEEN THROUGH way more often:\n\nYou arrive on time and wind up waiting 35-minutes to an hour because:\n\nA) plane landed late\nB) traffic on the runway\nC) baggage carousel took an eternity\nD) \u201csorry! Got lost in Starfleet HQ - i mean - the terminal!\u201d As in airports are huge and easy to get lost in.\n\nMy point is it\u2019s WAY more common to wind up standing there like a Justin Beiber groupie at the backstage entrance.", "NTA, but you would be one if you stayed with this chick. It sounds like she is willing to manipulate the story to her friends so she doesn't seem like the bad guy. You did nothing wrong. If I knew the flight would land at 7:40, I would check its status at 7, but also at 6 and 5 just to make sure it's not early.\n\nSomething else doesn't add up - unless there's like 2 airplane gates at the airport, it takes a hell of a lot longer than 15 mins to get out of an airport. But still all the same, NTA. Dropping off and picking up your S/O is typical of a long-term BF/GF relationship, but it should not be expected.", "NTA.  The correct response here is: \n\n\"I've got hairy balls, not crystal balls\"", "NTA. Where's the \"thanks, honey\"?  Picking people up from the airport adds a commitment to your day that essentially limits it. It's a nice gesture to pick someone up; where's the gratitude? A simple thanks would be nice", "Nta she's being over dramatic. 15 minutes, boohoo. When someone is nice enough to pick you up for the airport, you say thank you.", "NTA - you did your job. You watched her flight, you left on time. You can\u2019t help that her flight was early. Good grief, such a choosing beggar!", "Nta. If someone does me a favor I don\u2019t complain", "Fine, take an Uber. See you in a couple of days...maybe", "NTA. Run. Or fly.", "Leave her. She is not nice to you.", "NTA Once that texts started getting nasty I'd have turned around and let her take an uber. Verbal abuse is not ok.", "If I was a dick to my wife because I had to wait 30 minutes or less after my flight landed, I'd apologize later and say that I was wrong. She's the one putting in the half hour each way to come get me. Even if it is a bit inconsiderate, it's not a big deal. Your girlfriend needs to learn to choose her battles. My favorite quote goes something like \"you can tell the size of a person by the size of the things that bother him.\" I try to use that as a guide in all things.", "NTA, I would rather wait at the airport than have the person picking me up wait. You never know how long it\u2019ll take to deplane. I\u2019ve been on a flight that was only 40 minutes long and we landed early. It took 2 hours to deplane - not sure what the hold up was but I wouldn\u2019t want someone picking me up to also have to wait. \n\nFor trips in the future have your girlfriend drive and park or use Uber / Lyft since she expects immediate pick you up. FYI, if she parks her car and use shuttle she may have to wait 10-15 min for shuttle to come but it\u2019s no longer your problem. Also when you use Uber / Lyft it also may take 10-30 minutes to get one.", "NTA. She's probably in a bad mood and anxious to get home after traveling, but shouldn't take it out on you. You're not crazy, man.", "NTA\nShe has a phone, it can occupy her time. They she chargers if her battery was low.", "NTA - Had to wait 15 minutes...Boo Hoo; How Horrible!\n\nShe is unrealistic and an entitled brat. Perhaps her expectations are out of whack due to not traveling much.  Her texts to you are completely unacceptable. Do not tolerate being treated this way. Most people would be incredibly grateful to have curb-side pick-up at an airport within 15 minutes.", "NTA\n\nWhile I more or less agree with her that it really should not count as a favor 15 minutes is not a big deal especially given that you were at dinner with your parents and the online status was so far off. If you consider it a favor, both have a lot of things to talk about and may need some relationship counseling.\n\nShe did not speak to anyone who is impartial. It is likely she only spoke to her own cronies to validate her opinion.", "NTA. It was landing early by circumstance, and she wasn\u2019t waiting long.\n\nI have a bad feeling that people are agreeing with her just \u2018cause she\u2019s a girl >-<", "NTA.  Your girlfriend needs to learn how to say thank you.  Airport pickups are an even bigger favor than drop offs.  Next time let her wait for an Uber.", "Why is she making a big deal about it like you cheated or something \ud83d\ude02 I mean yeah no one wants to have to wait but it\u2019s not the end of the world lol", "Was she in a hurry?  15 minutes seems like pretty normal waiting for a ride at the airport time.", "NTA. Let her drive herself and pay for parking next time. 15 minutes isn't a big deal.", "NTA your gf seems like an entitled b\\*tch", "NTA", "NTAH, you should dump her", "I dont like your girlfriend very much.\n\nDo you? \n\nAre you commonly treated like trash in your relationship?", "NTA and your girlfriend seems very petty if she\u2019s now complaining to her friends about this. You were checking the flight and made decisions based on the information you had. Also, dropping someone off at an airport is a favour.", "Absolutely not the AH! \n\nYou had to drive 35 minutes each way X 2.\n\nThat's 2 hours and twenty minutes of your time you sacrificed for her and she couldn't even wait for 15 minutes???!!\n\nIf I was you I would have left her at the airport - she's so incredibly rude, disrespectful and entitled.", "nta at all", "Wtf. It was only 15 min. NTA.", "NTA. What a ridiculous expectation. I\u2019ve been married for many years, and I\u2019m just grateful when my spouse is able to come get me. Being angry at having to wait a few minutes is silly.", "NTA its not as if you were super late. She was early. She can't expect you to see into the future and know to sit there early. And I say this as someone who is almost always 15 minutes early.", "NTA. Picking up someone from an airport is a big ask. If she couldn't handle waiting 15 minutes for you to pick her up she can order an Uber, and likely wait 15 minutes for the Uber. \n\nBut you've learned a valuable life tip: No good deed goes unpunished when it comes to picking up people at the airport. You should always decline doing it.", "NTA... that was not a long time to wait and you were watching the tracker.\n\nThis is just the travel blues. If she keeps it up, suggest she arrange an uber next time.", "Absolutely NTA! Most airports near me have a parking/waiting charge if you get there early - much better for her to be waiting than for you to be. Also, you timed it pretty well if her flight hadn't landed early, which there's no way you could have known.", "You would be wrong if you stayed in a relationship with her. NTA.", "INFO\n\nIf it takes 35 minutes to get to the airport then why weren\u2019t you leaving around 7? It\u2019s weird to me that you are annoyed to have to wait in the cell phone lot but your girlfriend should have to suck it up and wait for you to pick her up after a day of traveling.", "NTA. Her reaction was out of line for a 15min wait.", "NTA - Hit her with the \"I'm sorry I didn't happen to get your text with the pilots phone number so he could tell me you guys were landing earlier\"\n\nPoor behavior from her, needs to learn that she asked someone a favor not summoned her fucking butler.", "NTA , she should've communicated with you.\nHow were you supposed to know?", "Slightly entitled, don't you think? So, in her eyes, things can't happen... I am sure she is perfectly perfect in all her ways all the time?", "NTA, but probably not the issue.\n\nShe may be blowing this one occurance up but it's probably something else that built it up and she's only now expressing it.\n\nDo you often not prioritize arriving places on time or early? Do you often have time blindness? Does she feel maybe you don't communicate enough to make her feel she's a priority?  If roles were switched, would she have done the same?  \n\nOf course her friends will agree with her, because likely she's not just sharing the scenario you just expressed but all the other examples that lead to this one thing becoming a big deal.\n\nAgain though - NTA, but rather than shifting that to meaning she is, just take a beat to zoom out and be sure it's not a bigger issue/red flag. I mean, it doesn't look great based just on the info here.\n\nOn another note, you also don't want to be TA that sits in the cell phone waiting area forever when there's a courtesy time limit.. Park somewhere 5 minutes away and wait for the \"I've landed/hitting customs/coming out\" text THEN pull up. Lol. \n\nBut yeah, when I first started dating my wife, I'd park, be at the gate with a gift, help with the bags. Now that we're older, she's grown past that type of stuff and would rather just be efficient and get home asap. I check google for the flight status and aim to arrive at least 10 minutes before she should be coming out the airport at our agreed spot.  The extra 10 minutes is so I can drive through some Starbucks or in case there's traffic.", "Waiting happens, especially when it comes to travel. someone always is going to have to wait, whether it be the person picking up or arriving. It is what it is. Not ideal for anyone.   \n\n\nYou're gf acting a bit entitled especially with her responses to you. I get she is mad and it is frustrating. Most people are tired and exhausted, so not surprising she would be upset. But she taken a bit too far with her responses, especially when she didn't have to wait too long either.   \n\n\nI am long distance with my partner and we know sometimes we have to wait.", "NTA\n\nPlanes can be early, on time, or late. \n\nLet's cross off planning on the plane being late, so that leaves planning to be there early or on time.  \n\nIf you plan on being there early, someone will be waiting in 2 of the 3 plane arrivals (early arrival is no wait; on time or late arrival is you waiting,  potentially for a long time). If you plan on being on time, then someone is still waiting in 2 of the 3 plane arrivals (if the plane is early she waits, if it's late you wait). That second (on time) plan balances the risk of waiting and reduces likelihood of anyone waiting the longest (early you arrival with late plane arrival). On time is the logical approach.\n\nBUT. Not everyone thinks logic applies here. I know some who feel that plane travel is just different and others need to shoulder some of the stress for the traveller. And, I know some who think that's especially true for women traveling and men picking up. \n\nIt's not really a question of who's the AH. The question is which is the base assumption between you two: logic & equality or chivalry  & women need extra help.", "Was this the first trip away in your relationship?  Could you have met her at the gate?  While I think she was over the top, this feels a bit like \"you didn't miss me\" energy.  And to be honest, your description of the day feels a bit like you didn't.\n\nIf she was expecting a romantic gesture, then you disappointed her.\n\nWhich doesn't make you an AH.  Just means that there was a mismatch in expectations and maybe some poor communication.\n\nMy wife's first business trip during our relationship was flowers at the gate (back when you could be at the gate).  By trip #10 (she traveled a lot for work) it was \"which pylon are you at, I'll slow down enough for you to jump in the car\".", "NTA.  Your GF sounds impatient.\n\nA question, though, are you habitually late when doing things with her?", "Oh wow a whole 15 minutes, NTA I also worry this is indicative of some sexism...", "Dump your girlfriend.

Proof or it didn't happen.", "At 7pm he knew he needed to leave and it waiting at least 10 more minutes.

YTA. You knew you were going to be late and figured screw it, I\u2019ll hang with my parents a bit longer. Also this is not a favor, it\u2019s literally what partners do for each other.

She's not just one of your buddies or an aquaintance you're fitting into your schedule. I assume when  you say girlfriend, that you're in an actual relationship.

Someone cool and with low expectations probably would be super happy you made the time to even come out of your \"busy schedule\" not care about waiting 15 minutes.", "Habitually? I don\u2019t think so. Could I be better? Yeah. Trying to be objective, I\u2019d say I\u2019m average for a mid 20\u2019s guy. I think it\u2019s been 2-3 times in the past year when she\u2019s been upset about me being late. And it\u2019s mostly golf taking longer than I expected\u2026", "Right, the entitlement and self importance of this one is wild", "He wasn\u2019t going to be late. He was leaving at 7.12 to arrive for 7.47. Her flight was supposed to get in at 7.28, and it takes 20 minutes to get out of the airport. So he expected her to arrive at 7.48. One minute is hardly enough to consider him running late in this situation.", "Why on earth would you arrive 15 minutes before an arrival time? When it takes another 20 minutes to get through arrivals then you\u2019re sitting around for half an hour for no reason.", "I agree.  Why is no one mentioning this.", "How was he rude?", "?? OP was right on schedule. It takes like 20 min to get off the plane, she wasn\u2019t expected til like 8 and she\u2019s mad he\u2019s there right when she was supposed to land.  Not her fault that it landed early but to pitch a fit about waiting is absolutely ridiculous.", "He already answered this. It would take 20 minutes for her to get through arrivals. So he was leaving at 7.12, expecting to arrive at 7.47. He thought her flight would get in at 7.28, meaning she would\u2019ve been through arrivals at 7.48. He\u2019s NTA, she\u2019s entitled and controlling.", "If the flight was going to land at 7:28pm, she's not going to teleport from the gate to the pickup area instantaneously. Unless the airport is very small, it would probably take 15 minutes to get outside so him leaving 15 minutes to make a 35 minute drive means that if her plane had landed on time, she would have had to wait maybe five minutes.\n\nShow me on the map where the bad man left you at the airport, yeesh.", "\u201c it\u2019s literally what partners do\u2026\u201d. Exactly. You have an obligation of results with them BE THERE. Same kind of excuse as people blaming traffic for being late to whatever event.

You're talking like that to someone who isn't late, or who is telling you they changed their mind last minute and to find your own transportation home, just someone who didn't get to the airport to sit and wait for you, EARLY.\n\nHoly smokes, she's unreasonable. NTA, OP.", "None of the girlfriend's quoted texts support your theory.", "The 1990s called. Time to go back.", "Not according to op. She was mad specifically because she had to wait at the airport. She told him his time management sucks because she had to wait. Maybe the airport she flew into doesn\u2019t have a free lot for short parking times. Maybe op can\u2019t afford to pay 15 bucks to park and go inside.", ">extremely toxic and controlling\n\nAnd so entitled! I'm in NYC and neither I nor most of my friends have cars, and I'm perfectly happy taking public transportation to and from the airport.

The vast majority of people would never, ever speak to their so in such a manner and no amount of \"oh the horror of airtravel\" makes it just an oopsie.

Before we moved provinces, our usual thing was leave the house at the time the flight is landing because it takes time to get off the plane, walk to the baggage claim, get your bags (we always checked bags) and then get out. \n\nHonestly NTA. I've had to wait over an hour for my BF at the airport before just due to traffic or him getting off work later than anticipated. Life happens. And there's been times if was my flight that was delayed and he was the one having to wait on me. I'm always just happy for the ride because we live an hour and a half away and it's over $300 for a taxi.", "Does she treat you like this often? It seems like she expects you to be at her beck and call.\n\nLife happens. So, she has to wait 15-30 minutes. Big whoop de doo. Her entitlement and her condescending attitude should have you rethinking a lot of thingsif this is how she routinely treats and talks to you when she suffers a truly minor inconvenience.\n\nYou know what I say when my husband is a little late picking me up at the airport? Cool - I'll go grab a coffee. Text where you want me to meet you when you are 5 minutes out. \n\nIts NOT difficult to treat people -- especially those you love -- with respect and dignity.

It\u2019s basically a designated parking area where people picking up passengers wait till they get the call from person they have landed.  This way you don\u2019t have to pay and wait in a garage.

I hope this is a wake-up call for OP.", "Idk, even at my most angry and annoyed days I couldn't conceive of saying any of that to my husband.", "That's so weird to me that people are late to pick up their loved ones. I'm always 20 minutes early when my husband flies back home because I can't wait to see him and that moment when he comes through the gate is exciting. Not even bothering to come on time is impressive.", "Yeah and they also have the flight info displayed on a big screen (or more than one screen at a large airport). Everyone parks their cars and sits there facing that screen like it's a drive-in movie. Usually they have restrooms and drink/snack machines too.", "Plus it might\u2019ve been stating the longest time it could potentially take? Idk, your point is better lol", "Did you miss the part that, by his own timeline, he would have been late even if the flight had been on time?\n\nIt was 715 and he hadn\u2019t even left for what he says is a 35 minute trip.

Or you don't fly Delta.", "I did not. \n\nDid you miss where he knew the flight was going to land early and still waited another 15 minutes to bother leaving?\n\nLook, her reaction was over-the-top. I don\u2019t agree with her either. But he\u2019s not innocent here either and his time management skills sucked since he should have already been halfway there.", "Or Southwest. In-flight texting (imessage and whatsapp) is free", "Love that. Linds doesn\u2019t fly Delta. Maybe better like this so we won\u2019t come across her on a plane \ud83d\ude05.", "I missed nothing. He was watching the time closely and tried to match up when he would be there and she would be ready. He details how he tried to do this as closely as possible.\n\nIt is so outrageous for her to expect him to expect her to land early and accommodate that, since we all know that even landing early doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t still be waiting a long time after. Last time I had a flight get in early we exited the plane an hour later than expected because everything was so backed up. And then baggage claim on top of that!\n\nShe could so easily have gotten a coffee and found a chair and not been a dick."]}
