For more detail, it belonged to my maternal grandmother and when she passed, my mum inherited it. It has always been a fact that she will give it to one of her daughters when we grow up. We also always assumed she will give it to my sister Mercy (28F). To be clear, it's not a super expensive ring or anything. Mum added a diamond to it but it costs around the same as the average engagement ring. \n\nThis might be important to the story: Mercy is my half sister, same dad different mums. Her bio mum has never been in the picture but my mum has always made it clear we are both her daughters and she loves us both. She has also always treated Mercy well.\n\n\nAnyway when mum gave the ring to my now fianc\u00e9 to propose to me, I was pleasantly surprised but also confused. But again, mum never said who she would give the ring to. Later I talked to mum about the ring and found out mum only gave my fianc\u00e9 the ring because Mercy didn't think she would ever get married.\n\nI talked to Mercy later and she confirmed this. She felt strongly against marriage and with good cause which isn't relevant here.\n\n\nThe issue now is that Mercy has been dating this nice guy let's call him Jake (35F). He is sweet, treats her like a queen and has a cute son. He has been putting it out there that he intends to propose and even asked for our parents' blessing. Now Mercy wants the ring back.\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I didn't have any problem giving it back right after our engagement and finding another one but it has come to mean so much to us. We have been planning our wedding with my late grandma in mind and grandma only had one ring, my current engagement ring, and it's like the final touch. Other details include remaking her wedding dress, using one of her necklaces, getting a wedding band that's a perfect match to pair with the engagement ring, etc. \n\n\nI told Mercy this and she said we can just design a ring that looks the same. One of her reasons is 'she isn't our mum's biological daughter so she should get this one privilege. She also thinks since mum intended to give her the ring anyway, so I should give it back to her.\n\n\nI still think she should not have said it was okay if it wasn't, and my fianc\u00e9 agrees. However, Mercy is not speaking to me and my parents have different opinions on this. So will I be the asshole if I hold onto the ring?", "created_utc": 1675537442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10toc16/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_late_grandmothers/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
