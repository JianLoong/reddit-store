{"id": 15207, "submission_id": "12s9j9k", "title": "AITA for \u201cruining\u201d my step sisters graduation dinner?", "selftext": "My (18F) dad got married to this woman about two and a half years ago and she has three daughters, with one of them being my age. We both graduated from high school at the same time obviously, and our graduation was on the same day too. We go to different schools though, so in the morning my dad and his wife attended mine and they went to my step sisters later in the afternoon.\n\nI get a text from my dad that evening saying that we were going to go to dinner to celebrate our graduation because my step sister wanted to. I told him that I had other plans that evening, I was going to watch the sunset with my friends. But I said yes and decided to go. About half an hour later they picked me up and we were on our way to a restaurant. However, it was taking longer than usual and right when we got to the restaurant my friends texted me saying that they were on their way to the place we were going to meet up to watch the sunset. We didn\u2019t leave the car yet so I told my dad to turn back and drive me home, and he got super upset because we had just got there. My step sister looked a little upset too and at this point I was raising my voice and telling my dad to drive me back because I didn\u2019t want to miss the sunset with my friends. They drove me back and I immediately slammed the door and left because so much of my time was wasted up by that. I did end up making it to the sunset with my friends though, which was good. \n\nThe next day I got a call from my dad and he said that they didn\u2019t end up going to the dinner because him and his wife (my step sisters mom) got into an argument about the situation. He also told me that that night when they got home from dropping me off, my step sister was talking to her mom saying that she was upset about the situation because she felt like her graduation dinner was ruined because I \u201cruined the mood\u201d by making my dad drive me back home, and that my dad got upset because of that and did not drive them to the dinner.  My step sister asked why I even decided to come if I knew I had other plans that were occurring close to the dinner.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow okay I am the asshole. And after reading everyone\u2019s comment I understand why. Some people are coming at me asking how I could believe I was anything but TA in this situation. I thought maybe my feelings of wanting to do my own plans for my graduation could possibly have made me NTA, and the fact that my dad was the one who actually didn\u2019t end up taking them to the restaurant, but I now know I went about it in the wrong way and shouldn\u2019t expect sympathy since I also ruined my step sisters day by acting selfish and trying to do everything all at once. \n\nI actually feel like this event made us distant because my step sister doesn\u2019t talk to me as much as before. I feel it\u2019s too late to apologize since it\u2019s already been a few weeks, but I hope she doesn\u2019t hold too much resentment towards me.\n\nEDIT 2: please do not message me mean and vulgar things, I know I messed up but that doesn\u2019t mean you can call me a stupid bitch and a cunt, amongst other things.", "created_utc": 1681937136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s9j9k/aita_for_ruining_my_step_sisters_graduation_dinner/", "score": 1046, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where you already were? But thank God you didn't miss that once-in-a-lifetime sunset for a routine high school graduation celebration!\n\nHoly shit YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have said you were going to the dinner, and once committed to that plan you shouldn't have demanded your dad drive you back. You messed everyone around to suit yourself.", "YTA  \nYou agreed to go for the dinner. And didn't cancel with your friends.  \nThen at the last moment when they call you, you again changed your mind and demanded to back.  \nYou clearly ruined the mood and spoiled dinner for your stepsis.", "YTA\n\nDon't make overlapping plans. Commit to something and stick with it.", "YTA with 100% certainty. You don't treat people like they are only good enough until a better offer comes along. You don't force a carload of people to turn around and rearrange their plans because you were feeling fickle.", "Damn. YTA. How in the world would you think you're *not* the asshole? And your attitude in general about it is horrible; demanding to be driven home, slamming doors.\n\n>My step sister asked why I even decided to come if I knew I had other plans that were occurring close to the dinner.\n\nThat's a good question.", "YTA - You sound like you acted really selfish.   \n\nBe cautious when acting like that, sooner or later people (like your friends) will think \"if she can do that to her dad and family, she can do that to us too\".  \n\nBuy your step sis something nice and say sorry to everyone and ask to smooth it over.    You're young, it's okay to make mistakes.  Just clean it up and it'll be okay.", "YTA. You should have declined the invitation to dinner if you preferred to watch a sunset (which happens, um, DAILY). But instead you took an opportunity to ruin -- no scare quotes -- your stepsister's evening. You obviously have an issue with \"this woman\" your dad married, so I question your motive.", "YTA. It comes off as you sabotaged the dinner on purpose. You don\u2019t make plans with two groups of people for the same time frame. Why were you yelling at your dad when it\u2019s you that didn\u2019t balance things properly?", "YTA.  You ruined her dinner because you couldn\u2019t tell time.", "YTA, why would you double book plans? that's just a waste of other peoples time", "Yta - def sounds like you didn't have time to do both, so your step sister is right.", "YTA Were you planning on participating the whole dinner and afterwards seeing your friends? That would not have fit timewise in one evening. Were you planning on asking your dad to drive you home halfway trough the dinner? How is the relationship between you and your stepsister? Are you sure you weren\u2019t just trying to ruin the dinner?", "YTA. Blatant sabotage.", "Over a sunset? Really?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted to watch the sunset, you should have stuck with that plan. If your dad didn't make the dinner plans early, telling them you already had plans for the evening is acceptable. They would have been disappointed but understood.\n\nBy being wishy-washy about what you wanted to do, then taking it out on your family, you became the a-hole by default. They wanted to do something nice for your graduations, and you threw it back in their faces.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't go out to dinner in a restaurant and expect to meet up with friends to watch the sunset on the same night,  unless it's the summer solstice and you went to dinner at the Senior Hour (4 pm).", "YTA for sure and your dad is doing you no favors. You yelled at him to take you home after you willingly agreed to come, and he did. If this apparently rare event of the setting sun was so important, then you shouldn't have agreed to go to dinner. I would be taking some time to reflect on the level of disrespect you showed your dad because most people in your future won't tolerate that type of behavior.", "YTA. While it's understandable that you wanted to spend time with your friends to celebrate your graduation, you had already agreed to attend the dinner with your family. Changing your mind at the last minute and insisting on being driven home not only inconvenienced your family but also put a damper on the mood of the celebration.\n\nYour step-sister's feelings of disappointment are valid, as the dinner was meant to be a celebration for both of you. It would have been more appropriate to either decline the dinner invitation from the beginning or to reschedule your plans with your friends for another time.\n\nIt's important to learn how to balance commitments and prioritize special occasions. In this situation, you could have communicated better with your family and made an effort to find a solution that would have allowed you to celebrate with both your family and friends without causing tension. An apology to your step-sister and family for your behavior may be a good starting point to mend the situation.", "Well it sounds like you had two plans and backed out on one but later flipped it the other way. If I'm understanding that right, yeah YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you had other plans you shouldn't have gone out with your family.  You could've eaten dinner with your family, and then asked if they could drop you/your step sister off to go see the sunset.", "YTA\n\nYou decided to go to a dinner even though you knew you had something else you wanted to do. Then you made a scene and made everyone turn around so that you could go to your pre-existing plans. You yelled in the car and slammed the door in full tantrum mode. Of course that ruined the mood.", "Is \u201csunset\u201d the new slang for oxy?\n\nYTA\nI\u2019m fairly certain your father wasn\u2019t upset because they said you ruined dinner.

There's nothing redeeming for you in this story, OP. I can't even imagine what the other side sounds like", "YTA and your dad should have told your adult ass to pay for an Uber if you wanted to change your mind last minute to see the sunset and act like a child to get your way.", "YTA so first you ditched your friends, then you changed your mind halfway through and not only ditched your family but forced their plans to be ruined by having to take the time go drop you off where you left in a rude ass flounce. Never even said please or thank you. Yelled at them and demanded it, making it clear you'd ruin dinner anyway if they didn't do as their highness commanded. And you think you're in the right because...? Guessing daddy has spoiled you rotten and you no longer think of anyone but yourself.", "YTA. You know you are.", "YTA and super entitled", "YTA. Really?", "Yes, I think yata. You could have never changed your plans only to change them back, and in the process, needed them to take you.", "YTA you said you\u2019d go to a dinner knowing you already had plans then ruined it for your step sister.", "Yta, why did you agree to go to the dinner in the first place? If you wanted to see the sunset, you should have just said that. And then you acted like a brat slamming the door and yelling.", "So why did you decide to go?", "YTA either goto the dinner or goto the sunset don't ruin other people's nights.", "Info: when you told your Dad you would go to dinner, how did you expect the evening to go? Did you think you had enough time to eat dinner and have your Dad drive you to meet your friends or did you not think that through?", "YTA you sound fucking insufferable.", "YTA. You really asking when you behaved so bratty?", "YTA not for having other plans but for agreeing to go to dinner when it was obvious wouldn't be able to do both and having them drive you back, you wasted everyone's time, and ruined everyone's night.\n\nAnd there was no excuse for it you graduated so obviously you know how to tell time and know you couldn't do both.\n\nAnd you should be intelligent enough by now to not need a bunch of strangers to tell you that you're wrong, because it's obvious even to you that you are", "YTA for being indecisive.  Say yes or no and stick with it.", "YTA and you know it.", "You got main character syndrome. Wow YTA", "YTA. Congrats on failing your first social outing as an adult.", "YTA and a brat. How someone who acts like that has friends is beyond me", "YTA. You agreed to dinner even with firm plans, then made dad/family jump through hoops to cancel and drive you home. You should have declined dinner if you were on such a tight timeline. You did ruin their celebration dinner by your selfish actions.", "YTA - I agree with your stepsister. You weren\u2019t forced to go. You chose to go knowing that you had other plans. Then you changed your mind On the way to the restaurant. That was selfish and inconsiderate of your family and their plans. It\u2019s also just mean to agree to dinner and then on the way to dinner make it very clear that you would rather be with your friends. For next time, the adult thing to do is say: \u201cI\u2019d love to but I already made other plans with friends. Maybe we could do something at another time.\u201d The end.", "I can understand where you're coming from but YTA. Sometimes it can be hard for families to understand that it's funner for you to hang out with your friends than be with them and then they get offended. But you definitely handled the situation badly. Best way forward: apologise to your family and get you step sis a meaningful gift as an apology or maybe you could plan a surprise graduation meal or a family activity/ trip to the cinema for everyone? I also find writing a sincere letter with tons of compliments for your family members usually helps a lot.", "YTA\nIf you knew you had other plans why did you make them drive you back? You absolutely ruined their plans, you could\u2019ve just paid for an Uber. Actually the real question is why did you decide to go in the first place? You clearly didn\u2019t have to go and knew they were happening at the same time, you absolutely ruined the mood. You sound incredibly selfish and immature, it\u2019s time to grow up and start being responsible and respectful to others.", "Yta. Appalling behaviour quite frankly. You ruined it through your utter selfishness. What the hell is so special about a sunset. Grow the hell up.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have stuck to one plan once things got into motion. Either stayed home and gone to watch the sunset, or gone to dinner. You did ruin the dinner b/c it didn't happen. That's pretty selfish.", "YTA - why didnt you just not go to the dinner. This was clearly going to be an issue and you seem to gave had the freedom to not go to the dinner. You made them drive you to the restaurant only to then force them to drive you straight back under duress of your shitty attitude", "YTA and you need to learn that you are not the main character, you have been very disrespectful of your father and your stepsister and you are probably just as disrespectful of other people in your life. Soon no one will want to have anything to do with you and you will left wondering why.", "Holy sh*t YTA so hard\u2026 how do you NOT know this? What an insufferable brat.", "Wow. Self absorbed much? YTA.", "You chose to go to the restaurant to get a meal paid for by your Dad, because you clearly weren\u2018t there to celebrate either of your success. You then made everyone miserable. If you wanted to skip out on the family celebration you should have done so. If you wanted to be selfish and try to get the free meal, you, an adult in age, presumably with a mobile phone since they\u2019re fairly ubiquitous, could have called a taxi, a ride share, or even one of your friends to swing by and pick you up.\n\nInstead you chose to make everyone miserable by whining for a ride. YTA", "YTA\n\nyou acted very selfishly", "You mean you actually took the time to type all this out and still felt the need for outside opinions by the time you got to the end?\n\nYes, YTA. Clearly YTA. Even small children would look at this behaviour and see YTA.", "It really depends on how the exchange went with your dad on the phone. If he assured you that the dinner would be over in time to meet with your friends, then you're not the asshole. If he was under the impression that you were allowing the dinner to be the priority though, then you didn't communicate clearly enough and were leaving too much to chance. In that scenario, from their perspective, you then decided your friends were more important after agreeing to the dinner. I think in future you need to be clear on your decision and make clear boundaries as early as possible.", "Honestly, ESH! \n\nYou made other plans and they made no plans. \n\nShe decided last minute that she wanted to go to a restaurant and your dad and stepmom were like \"ok, bet, we'll invite the other kid who happens to be graduating too\" as a total after thought. And then, you already had plans with your friends, but for some reason decided that you were going to hop on board with this without actually thinking it through or planning properly for the time. So, you bail, it causes a huge commotion and upends the half-assed plan that they threw together like an hour prior, and instead of just like going along with it or figuring something else out or just being a little bit later at the restaurant, your dad throws a temper tantrum and gets into a fight with his wife over the entire thing so nobody ends up going?

What a thoughtful, considerate and selfless thing to do. Then your step sister, following in this spirit of familial unity, comes up with the sweetest idea that you all should go out for a family dinner to celebrate! (Many families can only afford to go out like this a few times a year, btw). \n\nNow, you had the once in a lifetime opportunity to catch a sunset with your friends, god forbid you miss that. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re about to move into an entirely new stage in your life that inevitably separates you from your family to some kind of extent, right? I\u2019m *sure* your dad isn\u2019t going through any kinds of emotions over watching his baby girl officially stepping into adulthood, or the fact that you\u2019ll be moving out of his house within a few years. Nope, no reason that you should be soaking up as much time as possible with him right now. It\u2019s your friends, who will most likely be a completely different group of people in a few years, who are the important ones. Go ahead and throw your dad in a position where he has to defend you against his wife, who cares about him, right?\n\nAlso, gas is super cheap right now so it\u2019s not like that extra trip\u2026 oh wait, there was no extra trip because the whole thing was ruined, oops. \n\n/s\n\nYTA", "NTA - they should have planned better", "YTA and a spoiled brat. Wth were you trying to do other than ruin your family's night?", "YTA. You knew you had other plans and still went and ruined your stepsisters dinner.", "YTA how can you even be upset \"they waste your time\"?

So she could leave whenever?", "I decided to go because the agreement with my dad was that he drops me back when we were done dinner so that I could go with my friends. \n\nI guess I didn\u2019t anticipate that i wouldn\u2019t have time for both, so in that moment I had to prioritize my plans.", "I'll repeat:\n\nHoly shit YTA", "I'll repeat:\n\nHoly shit YTA", "I see what you did there\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Because she's selfish and Wanted to ruin the dinner for step sis.

You owe everyone an apology.", "Who could've guessed that dinner and the sunset happen at the same time?", "Why couldn't your friends pick you up from the restaurant, instead of having your dad take you back home?", "So you agreed to wait until *after* dinner like your dad suggested but then changed your mind bc you realized it was a mistake to double-book? And now you're blaming everyone else for your lack of planning, raising your voice and complaining that they wasted your time? No, OP, *you* wasted your own time. You should have either skipped going to the dinner or rescheduled with your friends.\n\nI know you say it took longer than usual to go to the restaurant, but there's no way you genuinely thought you would be able to make it through dinner before sunset. It took them half an hour alome to pick you up, and dinner itself usually takes about an hour. And you know what time sunset is. You should have taken into consideration how long it would take your dad to pick you up and then go to the restaurant, possible traffic, and the actual dinner itself.\n\n>I guess I didn\u2019t anticipate that i wouldn\u2019t have time for both,\n\nSo you admit that, but aomehow you can't bring yourself to admit that you're TA? It's your responsibility to be on top of your plans and make the best judgment call you can, and that means acknowledging that if you're going to be cutting 2 events extremely close, then it's probably better to avoid going ro one, eapecially if the other plans is a celebration for someone else. \n\nHow would you feel if the situation was reversed? If your step sister was the one with other plans and you were the one celebrating something at the restaurant, and right when you get there, she demands you guys turn around so she can go to her other thing and you don't actually get to go to dinner?

I can't tell are you agreeing with me or disagreeing with me?", "Geez now I got to agree with a guy who I was already arguing with. \n\nYeah, OP wasn't forced . she just suddenly changed her mind and wanted to do both the dinner and the sunset viewing. Which she doesn't explain at all.", "Ya I guess. But also, just because my dad got upset with me and had to drive me back doesn\u2019t mean that they still couldn\u2019t have gone to dinner. the reaction didn\u2019t have to be my dad not taking them at all, they still could have had a nice dinner while I did my thing. \n\nSeems like everyone in the sub is against me but it\u2019s not my fault that my dad still didn\u2019t take my step sister and her family out.", "Yeah its not like us humans haven't figured that out over the last...oh, thousands of years", ">Every comment so far is ignoring that part. I'd be kind of bitter and pissy too.\n\nThen you're a brat, too lmfao. You communicate like an adult to either your friends and say you misjudged timing or your family that you've decided not to go. You don't scream in the car at the restaurant that you're going to miss a sunset. And wasn't OP involved with the planning of the dinner if they originally decided they were going to skip and watch the sunset?

Not everyone is fortunate enough to celebrate milestones with their family. OP is a brat.", "You're twisting yourself into pretzels trying to throw shit on the parents.", "The car thing is what threw me off. \n\nWas she expecting her friends to pick her up? Then why make everyone go home? Tell them to get you.\n\nWas she expecting to drive there? Then take her own car. \n\nEasiest thing she could have done was say: \"I was planning to go to the sunset. I need to be X place by Y time. (sunset is pretty easy to figure out).\" \n\nThe photos and congrats doesn't hold water because she never even went inside the restaurant. If it was before at the house, that would've already told her she couldn't make the sunset. There's no way that she couldn't have any idea of the time it takes to get where ever.", "Agreed with the power move idea. It's just weird timing to think that you are all mad that the dinner wasn't over by the time you just got to the restaurant. \n\nI was taught that don't feel bad about feeling the worse of everyone. That just means you won't be disappointed lol.", "> Seems like everyone in the sub is against me\n\nI think that's because this is a sub about judging assholes and you sound like an asshole. Hope this helps!", "Why ask if you\u2019re the asshole and then argue that you\u2019re not? If you\u2019ve got 100 people agreeing that you are, you probably are. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate peoples reactions to things. You upset them by being selfish.

Everyone is saying you are in the wrong because you are. Not sure what other verdict you were expecting here to be honest\n\nBe an adult and apologise", "\"Seems like everyone in the sub is against me\" have you considered your step sister feels the same that that her step father gave into her step sister's tantrum?

Look, I get that your dad marrying someone else is hard, and having all these new people in your life can be equally hard. Believe me, I get it, because I lived it too. \n\nBut you should have just gone with your friends and never said yes to dinner. We're not against you. You asked if you were the AH in this story.", ">Then you're a brat, too lmfao.\n\nNah, I'm better at managing my emotions than that and would have stuck to my plans of hanging out with friends. I'm just pointing out that it seems like OP was an afterthought when they both graduated and I understand her being salty. \n\nIt seems weird that a dinner celebration after two grad ceremonies is spontaneous and not a planned event and OP was left out of the loop. Which c'mon, that would be a slap in the face and an obvious show of favoritism of the step sister. \n\nWho knows, maybe OP always acts like this and there's a reason she was excluded until the very last second.", "That's why I had to ask if you were agreeing or disagreeing. Cuz I wasn't throwing shit on the parents. Even if the dad and the stepmom did every step in the book of trying to adjust their children to the remarriage, are you telling me it's not an upheaval to add four +people to their home suddenly as a step parent and step siblings? \nAlso OP didn't give me any ammo to throw. Besides what I just mentioned (4+), she didn't say if she had any problems with them in particular. They obviously don't seem close, but OP doesn't give share animosity.", "Buuuuuut, that would require OP to plan ahead. \n\nShe just wants to do what she wants when she wants it. \n\nI mean, she was so upset about missing the sunset.

Did the sun pause where it was so that OP wouldn't miss it? \n\n/s\n\nI feel bad for the stepsister. But I think that the Dad mishandled this.

I had my reasons to be frustrated though.", "I get what you're saying now, I'm sorry for being aggressive. However, and not that this is necessarily true for everyone, but my family wouldn't plan dinners but I kind of always knew for these sort of events that we would take time out of our nights to celebrate. Maybe it's odd that this did get \"sprung\" on them, and maybe that doesn't help, but OP is absolutely in the wrong here and should explain the feelings you've explain, if that's how they feel. And there are still a million ways to handle this otherwise, like maybe saying \"hey can we do a whole family dinner tomorrow or some time this week?\" Or maybe reschedule with their friends.

There\u2019s fkn 364 more sunsets you could have watched or been watching in the year, one day out of your life OP wouldn\u2019t have killed you. And before anyone goes bashing me for thinking \u201cbut its HER GRADUATION\u201d my own parents didn\u2019t even come to my graduation because they had to work.

Then you throw a fit? Way to ruin everyone else's night, but at least you got what you wanted, right? You seem like a very entitled, rude, thoughtless person. Time to grow up.", "YTA. Why did you even come?", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have agreed to attend the dinner if you had other plans. You shouldn\u2019t have demanded to be driven back when your friends texted you after you already committed to the dinner as a family.\n\nYou did ruin the mood because you ended up sabotaging one graduation celebration for just your own. Not only did that put your dad in a difficult situation, but it showed a disregard for how the rest of the family would be effected.\n\nThe intention was to celebrate you both as family to a nice meal..your step sister simply came up with the idea. \n\nWhat a shame.", "Yes of course YTA.  You acted like an entitled brat and ruined everyone\u2019s evening except your own.  Why did you even say you\u2019d go when you knew you had to be somewhere else at a specific time\u2026.

Something in that teenage brain doesn't have a lot of empathy and emotional maturity. Demanding to be brought home and then slamming doors is just basic asshole behavior. I can't imagine you feel good about how you acted, or you wouldn't be here asking. \n\nThe key here is that you grow from this situation. It was your special night, for sure. But you have people that love you and worked hard with you to achieve it. And, a step sister who was also hoping for a special night. The right thing to do in this situation was to either politely decline or go and enjoy a dinner with the other graduate in your life. \n\nAlthough you were definitely the asshole, it's not fatal.

Maybe you thought you could squeeze in both, maybe you wanted to disrupt dinner. We don\u2019t really know, but in either case your actions disrupted the plans of everyone else in a completely avoidable way. Once you got in that car, you should have just went to dinner. You can\u2019t control that your dad got into an argument with your step mom causing them to not go to the restaurant, but if you had just made a solid choice before getting into the car it never would have happened and your step sister would have had a nice dinner celebrating her accomplishment the way she wanted to as well.", "In what universe are you considering yourself N T A here?

You ruined your step-sister's night.", "I liked how she put \"ruining\" in quotes, as if we were all going to laugh at the suggestion instead of agree.\n\nOP absolutely ruined the dinner, and it sounds like OP is spoiled and entitled, with the screaming and slamming doors and loud demands.", "such an immature move. 18 or 8?", "Maybe she thought they were driving through McDonald\u2019s", "Imagine 5 years from now when she no longer talks to any of those friends and lost touch.

Cuz I thought you could just spend it however you want.", "Lol \n>we didn\u2019t leave the car yet\n\nClearly op is used to getting everything her way. So spoiled. Why would you expect people to bend to your will like that? You could have had your friends pick you up from the restaurant or better yet could have just said no. And also, sunset is at like 7:30?

That actually isn't the issue here.\n\nJust don't ruin other people's plan by pfaffing around and wasting people's time - especially your dads having to drive you back and forth for nothing.\n\nWhat was the point of saying yes when you clearly have nothing but disdain for your fathers new family and did not want to go.

They happen all the time... sometimes in reverse.\n\nSarcasm aside, I'm hung up on your attitude: \"dad had to drive me back\". No, he didn't. You double-booked and this would have been a good time to learn a lesson in maturity as you enter adulthood.\n\nHow long was the car ride before you yelled at your dad to turn around? He didn't ruin the mood. His wife was probably upset with him that he gave into your selfish demands. In order to avoid that tension for him, you wouldn't have gotten to see that sunset with your friends so cut your dad some slack.

I know you're only 18 but holy crap are you immature and an asshole. I'm going to tell you a secret you may not be aware of, there was a sunset the next night and the night after. In fact there's actually one every night! But you couldn't possibly meet your friends another time and celebrate with your family? This was an important day for your step sister as well and you ruined her celebration by acting like a brat after you agreed to go. If I was your parent I would have said you can come in the restaurant, sit in the car or take an Uber back.", "No you didn\u2019t\n\nBut congratulations now your stepsister has her reasons to exclude you from all future plans. Heck, your stepmother and her other daughters probably also will refrain from including you in things because why even invite you when you are just going to ruin it for everyone?", "Because it\u2019s frustrating having to be in the middle and feeling obligated to go to both plans.
