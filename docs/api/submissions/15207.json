We both graduated from high school at the same time obviously, and our graduation was on the same day too. We go to different schools though, so in the morning my dad and his wife attended mine and they went to my step sisters later in the afternoon.\n\nI get a text from my dad that evening saying that we were going to go to dinner to celebrate our graduation because my step sister wanted to. I told him that I had other plans that evening, I was going to watch the sunset with my friends. But I said yes and decided to go. About half an hour later they picked me up and we were on our way to a restaurant. However, it was taking longer than usual and right when we got to the restaurant my friends texted me saying that they were on their way to the place we were going to meet up to watch the sunset. We didn\u2019t leave the car yet so I told my dad to turn back and drive me home, and he got super upset because we had just got there. My step sister looked a little upset too and at this point I was raising my voice and telling my dad to drive me back because I didn\u2019t want to miss the sunset with my friends. They drove me back and I immediately slammed the door and left because so much of my time was wasted up by that. I did end up making it to the sunset with my friends though, which was good. \n\nThe next day I got a call from my dad and he said that they didn\u2019t end up going to the dinner because him and his wife (my step sisters mom) got into an argument about the situation. He also told me that that night when they got home from dropping me off, my step sister was talking to her mom saying that she was upset about the situation because she felt like her graduation dinner was ruined because I \u201cruined the mood\u201d by making my dad drive me back home, and that my dad got upset because of that and did not drive them to the dinner.  My step sister asked why I even decided to come if I knew I had other plans that were occurring close to the dinner.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681937136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s9j9k/aita_for_ruining_my_step_sisters_graduation_dinner/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA.", "Wait, you agreed to join them, then when they had already arrived at the restaurant you demanded they turn around and drive you back home? Instead of going inside the restaurant? Where you already were? But thank God you didn't miss that once-in-a-lifetime sunset for a routine high school graduation celebration!\n\nHoly shit YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have said you were going to the dinner, and once committed to that plan you shouldn't have demanded your dad drive you back. You messed everyone around to suit yourself.", "YTA  \nYou agreed to go for the dinner. And didn't cancel with your friends.  \nThen at the last moment when they call you, you again changed your mind and demanded to back.  \nYou clearly ruined the mood and spoiled dinner for your stepsis.", "YTA\n\nDon't make overlapping plans. Commit to something and stick with it.", "YTA with 100% certainty. You don't treat people like they are only good enough until a better offer comes along. You don't force a carload of people to turn around a rearrange their plans because you were feeling fickle.", "Damn. YTA. How in the world would you think you're *not* the asshole? And your attitude in general about it is horrible; demanding to be driven home, slamming doors.\n\n>My step sister asked why I even decided to come if I knew I had other plans that were occurring close to the dinner.\n\nThat's a good question.", "YTA - You sound like you acted really selfish.   \n\nBe cautious when acting like that, sooner or later people (like your friends) will think \"if she can do that to her dad and family, she can do that to us too\".  \n\nBuy your step sis something nice and say sorry to everyone and ask to smooth it over.    You're young, it's okay to make mistakes.  Just clean it up and it'll be okay.", "YTA. You should have declined the invitation to dinner if you preferred to watch a sunset (which happens, um, DAILY). But instead you took an opportunity to ruin -- no scare quotes -- your stepsister's evening. You obviously have an issue with \"this woman\" your dad married, so I question your motive.", "YTA. It comes off as you sabotaged the dinner on purpose. You don\u2019t make plans with two groups of people for the same time frame. Why were you yelling at your dad when it\u2019s you that didn\u2019t balance things properly?", "YTA.  You ruined her dinner because you couldn\u2019t tell time.", "YTA, why would you double book plans? that's just a waste of other peoples time", "Yta - def sounds like you didn't have time to do both, so your step sister is right.", "YTA Were you planning on participating the whole dinner and afterwards seeing your friends? That would not have fit timewise in one evening. Were you planning on asking your dad to drive you home halfway trough the dinner? How is the relationship between you and your stepsister? Are you sure you weren\u2019t just trying to ruin the dinner?", "YTA. Blatant sabotage.", "Over a sunset? Really?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted to watch the sunset, you should have stuck with that plan. If your dad didn't make the dinner plans early, telling them you already had plans for the evening is acceptable. They would have been disappointed but understood.\n\nBy being wishy-washy about what you wanted to do, then taking it out on your family, you became the a-hole by default. They wanted to do something nice for your graduations, and you threw it back in their faces.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't go out to dinner in a restaurant and expect to meet up with friends to watch the sunset on the same night,  unless it's the summer solstice and you went to dinner at the Senior Hour (4 pm).", "YTA for sure and your dad is doing you no favors. You yelled at him to take you home after you willingly agreed to come, and he did. If this apparently rare event of the setting sun was so important, then you shouldn't have agreed to go to dinner. I would be taking some time to reflect on the level of disrespect you showed your dad because most people in your future won't tolerate that type of behavior.", "YTA. While it's understandable that you wanted to spend time with your friends to celebrate your graduation, you had already agreed to attend the dinner with your family. Changing your mind at the last minute and insisting on being driven home not only inconvenienced your family but also put a damper on the mood of the celebration.\n\nYour step-sister's feelings of disappointment are valid, as the dinner was meant to be a celebration for both of you. It would have been more appropriate to either decline the dinner invitation from the beginning or to reschedule your plans with your friends for another time.\n\nIt's important to learn how to balance commitments and prioritize special occasions. In this situation, you could have communicated better with your family and made an effort to find a solution that would have allowed you to celebrate with both your family and friends without causing tension. An apology to your step-sister and family for your behavior may be a good starting point to mend the situation.", "Well it sounds like you had two plans and backed out on one but later flipped it the other way. If I'm understanding that right, yeah YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you had other plans you shouldn't have gone out with your family.  You could've eaten dinner with your family, and then asked if they could drop you/your step sister off to go see the sunset.", "YTA\n\nYou decided to go to a dinner even though you knew you had something else you wanted to do. Then you made a scene and made everyone turn around so that you could go to your pre-existing plans. You yelled in the car and slammed the door in full tantrum mode. Of course that ruined the mood.", "Is \u201csunset\u201d the new slang for oxy?\n\nYTA\nI\u2019m fairly certain your father wasn\u2019t upset because they said you ruined dinner. He was upset because they were angry at him for you ruining dinner.", "YTA - you agreed to do something with your family then intentionally disrupted it.", "YTA \n\nhow could you not realize that typing it out? There's nothing redeeming for you in this story, OP. I can't even imagine what the other side sounds like", "YTA and your dad should have told your adult ass to pay for an Uber if you wanted to change your mind last minute to see the sunset and act like a child to get your way.", "YTA so first you ditched your friends, then you changed your mind halfway through and not only ditched your family but forced their plans to be ruined by having to take the time go drop you off where you left in a rude ass flounce. Never even said please or thank you. Yelled at them and demanded it, making it clear you'd ruin dinner anyway if they didn't do as their highness commanded. And you think you're in the right because...? Guessing daddy has spoiled you rotten and you no longer think of anyone but yourself.", "YTA. You know you are.", "YTA and super entitled", "YTA. Really?", "Yes, I think yata. You could have never changed your plans only to change them back, and in the process, needed them to take you.", "YTA you said you\u2019d go to a dinner knowing you already had plans then ruined it for your step sister.", "Yta, why did you agree to go to the dinner in the first place? If you wanted to see the sunset, you should have just said that. And then you acted like a brat slamming the door and yelling.", "So why did you decide to go?", "YTA either goto the dinner or goto the sunset don't ruin other people's nights.", "Info: when you told your Dad you would go to dinner, how did you expect the evening to go? Did you think you had enough time to eat dinner and have your Dad drive you to meet your friends or did you not think that through?", "YTA you sound fucking insufferable.", "YTA. You really asking when you behaved so bratty?", "YTA not for having other plans but for agreeing to go to dinner when it was obvious wouldn't be able to do both and having them drive you back, you wasted everyone's time, and ruined everyone's night.\n\nAnd there was no excuse for it you graduated so obviously you know how to tell time and know you couldn't do both.\n\nAnd you should be intelligent enough by now to not need a bunch of strangers to tell you that you're wrong, because it's obvious even to you that you are", "YTA for being indecisive.  Say yes or no and stick with it.", "YTA and you know it.", "You got main character syndrome. Wow YTA", "YTA. Congrats on failing your first social outing as an adult.", "YTA and a brat. How someone who acts like that has friends is beyond me", "YTA. You agreed to dinner even with firm plans, then made dad/family jump through hoops to cancel and drive you home. You should have declined dinner if you were on such a tight timeline. You did ruin their celebration dinner by your selfish actions.", "YTA - I agree with your stepsister. You weren\u2019t forced to go. You chose to go knowing that you had other plans. Then you changed your mind On the way to the restaurant. That was selfish and inconsiderate of your family and their plans. It\u2019s also just mean to agree to dinner and then on the way to dinner make it very clear that you would rather be with your friends. For next time, the adult thing to do is say: \u201cI\u2019d love to but I already made other plans with friends. Maybe we could do something at another time.\u201d The end.", "I can understand where you're coming from but YTA. Sometimes it can be hard for families to understand that it's funner for you to hang out with your friends than be with them and then they get offended. But you definitely handled the situation badly. Best way forward: apologise to your family and get you step sis a meaningful gift as an apology or maybe you could plan a surprise graduation meal or a family activity/ trip to the cinema for everyone? I also find writing a sincere letter with tons of compliments for your family members usually helps a lot.", "YTA\nIf you knew you had other plans why did you make them drive you back? You absolutely ruined their plans, you could\u2019ve just paid for an Uber. Actually the real question is why did you decide to go in the first place? You clearly didn\u2019t have to go and knew they were happening at the same time, you absolutely ruined the mood. You sound incredibly selfish and immature, it\u2019s time to grow up and start being responsible and respectful to others.", "Yta. Appalling behaviour quite frankly. You ruined it through your utter selfishness. What the hell is so special about a sunset. Grow the hell up.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have stuck to one plan once things got into motion. Either stayed home and gone to watch the sunset, or gone to dinner. You did ruin the dinner b/c it didn't happen. That's pretty selfish.", "YTA - why didnt you just not go to the dinner. This was clearly going to be an issue and you seem to gave had the freedom to not go to the dinner. You made them drive you to the restaurant only to then force them to drive you straight back under duress of your shitty attitude", "YTA and you need to learn that you are not the main character, you have been very disrespectful of your father and your stepsister and you are probably just as disrespectful of other people in your life. Soon no one will want to have anything to do with you and you will left wondering why.", "Holy sh*t YTA so hard\u2026 how do you NOT know this? What an insufferable brat.", "Wow. Self absorbed much? YTA.", "You chose to go to the restaurant to get a meal paid for by your Dad, because you clearly weren\u2018t there to celebrate either of your success. You then made everyone miserable. If you wanted to skip out on the family celebration you should have done so. If you wanted to be selfish and try to get the free meal, you, an adult in age, presumably with a mobile phone since they\u2019re fairly ubiquitous, could have called a taxi, a ride share, or even one of your friends to swing by and pick you up.\n\nInstead you chose to make everyone miserable by whining for a ride. YTA", "YTA\n\nyou acted very selfishly", "You mean you actually took the time to type all this out and still felt the need for outside opinions by the time you got to the end?\n\nYes, YTA. Clearly YTA. Even small children would look at this behaviour and see YTA.", "It really depends on how the exchange went with your dad on the phone. If he assured you that the dinner would be over in time to meet with your friends, then you're not the asshole. If he was under the impression that you were allowing the dinner to be the priority though, then you didn't communicate clearly enough and were leaving too much to chance. In that scenario, from their perspective, you then decided your friends were more important after agreeing to the dinner. I think in future you need to be clear on your decision and make clear boundaries as early as possible.", "Honestly, ESH! \n\nYou made other plans and they made no plans. \n\nShe decided last minute that she wanted to go to a restaurant and your dad and stepmom were like \"ok, bet, we'll invite the other kid who happens to be graduating too\" as a total after thought. And then, you already had plans with your friends, but for some reason decided that you were going to hop on board with this without actually thinking it through or planning properly for the time. So, you bail, it causes a huge commotion and upends the half-assed plan that they threw together like an hour prior, and instead of just like going along with it or figuring something else out or just being a little bit later at the restaurant, your dad throws a temper tantrum and gets into a fight with his wife over the entire thing so nobody ends up going? This whole family is a mess of selfish people who apparently have no time management abilities or forethought", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You double booked yourself. Then you made 3 other people take you home so you could do the original plan.
