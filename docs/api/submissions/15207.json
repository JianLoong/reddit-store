We both graduated from high school at the same time obviously, and our graduation was on the same day too. We go to different schools though, so in the morning my dad and his wife attended mine and they went to my step sisters later in the afternoon.\n\nI get a text from my dad that evening saying that we were going to go to dinner to celebrate our graduation because my step sister wanted to. I told him that I had other plans that evening, I was going to watch the sunset with my friends. But I said yes and decided to go. About half an hour later they picked me up and we were on our way to a restaurant. However, it was taking longer than usual and right when we got to the restaurant my friends texted me saying that they were on their way to the place we were going to meet up to watch the sunset. We didn\u2019t leave the car yet so I told my dad to turn back and drive me home, and he got super upset because we had just got there. My step sister looked a little upset too and at this point I was raising my voice and telling my dad to drive me back because I didn\u2019t want to miss the sunset with my friends. They drove me back and I immediately slammed the door and left because so much of my time was wasted up by that. I did end up making it to the sunset with my friends though, which was good. \n\nThe next day I got a call from my dad and he said that they didn\u2019t end up going to the dinner because him and his wife (my step sisters mom) got into an argument about the situation. He also told me that that night when they got home from dropping me off, my step sister was talking to her mom saying that she was upset about the situation because she felt like her graduation dinner was ruined because I \u201cruined the mood\u201d by making my dad drive me back home, and that my dad got upset because of that and did not drive them to the dinner.  My step sister asked why I even decided to come if I knew I had other plans that were occurring close to the dinner.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681937136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s9j9k/aita_for_ruining_my_step_sisters_graduation_dinner/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where you already were? But thank God you didn't miss that once-in-a-lifetime sunset for a routine high school graduation celebration!\n\nHoly shit YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have said you were going to the dinner, and once committed to that plan you shouldn't have demanded your dad drive you back. You messed everyone around to suit yourself.", "YTA  \nYou agreed to go for the dinner. And didn't cancel with your friends.  \nThen at the last moment when they call you, you again changed your mind and demanded to back.  \nYou clearly ruined the mood and spoiled dinner for your stepsis.", "YTA\n\nDon't make overlapping plans. Commit to something and stick with it.", "YTA with 100% certainty. You don't treat people like they are only good enough until a better offer comes along. You don't force a carload of people to turn around and rearrange their plans because you were feeling fickle.", "Damn. YTA. How in the world would you think you're *not* the asshole? And your attitude in general about it is horrible; demanding to be driven home, slamming doors.\n\n>My step sister asked why I even decided to come if I knew I had other plans that were occurring close to the dinner.\n\nThat's a good question.", "YTA - You sound like you acted really selfish.   \n\nBe cautious when acting like that, sooner or later people (like your friends) will think \"if she can do that to her dad and family, she can do that to us too\".  \n\nBuy your step sis something nice and say sorry to everyone and ask to smooth it over.    You're young, it's okay to make mistakes.  Just clean it up and it'll be okay.", "YTA. You should have declined the invitation to dinner if you preferred to watch a sunset (which happens, um, DAILY). But instead you took an opportunity to ruin -- no scare quotes -- your stepsister's evening. You obviously have an issue with \"this woman\" your dad married, so I question your motive.", "YTA. It comes off as you sabotaged the dinner on purpose. You don\u2019t make plans with two groups of people for the same time frame. Why were you yelling at your dad when it\u2019s you that didn\u2019t balance things properly?", "YTA.  You ruined her dinner because you couldn\u2019t tell time.", "YTA, why would you double book plans? that's just a waste of other peoples time", "Yta - def sounds like you didn't have time to do both, so your step sister is right.", "YTA Were you planning on participating the whole dinner and afterwards seeing your friends? That would not have fit timewise in one evening. Were you planning on asking your dad to drive you home halfway trough the dinner? How is the relationship between you and your stepsister? Are you sure you weren\u2019t just trying to ruin the dinner?", "YTA. Blatant sabotage.", "Over a sunset? Really?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted to watch the sunset, you should have stuck with that plan. If your dad didn't make the dinner plans early, telling them you already had plans for the evening is acceptable. They would have been disappointed but understood.\n\nBy being wishy-washy about what you wanted to do, then taking it out on your family, you became the a-hole by default. They wanted to do something nice for your graduations, and you threw it back in their faces.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't go out to dinner in a restaurant and expect to meet up with friends to watch the sunset on the same night,  unless it's the summer solstice and you went to dinner at the Senior Hour (4 pm).", "YTA for sure and your dad is doing you no favors. You yelled at him to take you home after you willingly agreed to come, and he did. If this apparently rare event of the setting sun was so important, then you shouldn't have agreed to go to dinner. I would be taking some time to reflect on the level of disrespect you showed your dad because most people in your future won't tolerate that type of behavior.", "YTA. While it's understandable that you wanted to spend time with your friends to celebrate your graduation, you had already agreed to attend the dinner with your family. Changing your mind at the last minute and insisting on being driven home not only inconvenienced your family but also put a damper on the mood of the celebration.\n\nYour step-sister's feelings of disappointment are valid, as the dinner was meant to be a celebration for both of you. It would have been more appropriate to either decline the dinner invitation from the beginning or to reschedule your plans with your friends for another time.\n\nIt's important to learn how to balance commitments and prioritize special occasions. In this situation, you could have communicated better with your family and made an effort to find a solution that would have allowed you to celebrate with both your family and friends without causing tension. An apology to your step-sister and family for your behavior may be a good starting point to mend the situation.", "Well it sounds like you had two plans and backed out on one but later flipped it the other way. If I'm understanding that right, yeah YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you had other plans you shouldn't have gone out with your family.  You could've eaten dinner with your family, and then asked if they could drop you/your step sister off to go see the sunset.", "YTA\n\nYou decided to go to a dinner even though you knew you had something else you wanted to do. Then you made a scene and made everyone turn around so that you could go to your pre-existing plans. You yelled in the car and slammed the door in full tantrum mode. Of course that ruined the mood.", "Is \u201csunset\u201d the new slang for oxy?\n\nYTA\nI\u2019m fairly certain your father wasn\u2019t upset because they said you ruined dinner.

There's nothing redeeming for you in this story, OP. I can't even imagine what the other side sounds like", "YTA and your dad should have told your adult ass to pay for an Uber if you wanted to change your mind last minute to see the sunset and act like a child to get your way.", "YTA so first you ditched your friends, then you changed your mind halfway through and not only ditched your family but forced their plans to be ruined by having to take the time go drop you off where you left in a rude ass flounce. Never even said please or thank you. Yelled at them and demanded it, making it clear you'd ruin dinner anyway if they didn't do as their highness commanded. And you think you're in the right because...? Guessing daddy has spoiled you rotten and you no longer think of anyone but yourself.", "YTA. You know you are.", "YTA and super entitled", "YTA. Really?", "Yes, I think yata. You could have never changed your plans only to change them back, and in the process, needed them to take you.", "YTA you said you\u2019d go to a dinner knowing you already had plans then ruined it for your step sister.", "Yta, why did you agree to go to the dinner in the first place?

Did you think you had enough time to eat dinner and have your Dad drive you to meet your friends or did you not think that through?", "YTA you sound fucking insufferable.", "YTA. You really asking when you behaved so bratty?", "YTA not for having other plans but for agreeing to go to dinner when it was obvious wouldn't be able to do both and having them drive you back, you wasted everyone's time, and ruined everyone's night.\n\nAnd there was no excuse for it you graduated so obviously you know how to tell time and know you couldn't do both.\n\nAnd you should be intelligent enough by now to not need a bunch of strangers to tell you that you're wrong, because it's obvious even to you that you are", "YTA for being indecisive.  Say yes or no and stick with it.", "YTA and you know it.", "You got main character syndrome. Wow YTA", "YTA. Congrats on failing your first social outing as an adult.", "YTA and a brat. How someone who acts like that has friends is beyond me", "YTA. You agreed to dinner even with firm plans, then made dad/family jump through hoops to cancel and drive you home. You should have declined dinner if you were on such a tight timeline. You did ruin their celebration dinner by your selfish actions.", "YTA - I agree with your stepsister. You weren\u2019t forced to go. You chose to go knowing that you had other plans. Then you changed your mind On the way to the restaurant. That was selfish and inconsiderate of your family and their plans. It\u2019s also just mean to agree to dinner and then on the way to dinner make it very clear that you would rather be with your friends.

Maybe we could do something at another time.\u201d The end.", "I can understand where you're coming from but YTA. Sometimes it can be hard for families to understand that it's funner for you to hang out with your friends than be with them and then they get offended. But you definitely handled the situation badly. Best way forward: apologise to your family and get you step sis a meaningful gift as an apology or maybe you could plan a surprise graduation meal or a family activity/ trip to the cinema for everyone? I also find writing a sincere letter with tons of compliments for your family members usually helps a lot.", "YTA\nIf you knew you had other plans why did you make them drive you back? You absolutely ruined their plans, you could\u2019ve just paid for an Uber. Actually the real question is why did you decide to go in the first place? You clearly didn\u2019t have to go and knew they were happening at the same time, you absolutely ruined the mood. You sound incredibly selfish and immature, it\u2019s time to grow up and start being responsible and respectful to others.", "Yta. Appalling behaviour quite frankly. You ruined it through your utter selfishness. What the hell is so special about a sunset. Grow the hell up.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have stuck to one plan once things got into motion. Either stayed home and gone to watch the sunset, or gone to dinner. You did ruin the dinner b/c it didn't happen. That's pretty selfish.", "YTA - why didnt you just not go to the dinner. This was clearly going to be an issue and you seem to gave had the freedom to not go to the dinner. You made them drive you to the restaurant only to then force them to drive you straight back under duress of your shitty attitude", "YTA and you need to learn that you are not the main character, you have been very disrespectful of your father and your stepsister and you are probably just as disrespectful of other people in your life. Soon no one will want to have anything to do with you and you will left wondering why.", "Holy sh*t YTA so hard\u2026 how do you NOT know this? What an insufferable brat.", "Wow. Self absorbed much? YTA.", "You chose to go to the restaurant to get a meal paid for by your Dad, because you clearly weren\u2018t there to celebrate either of your success. You then made everyone miserable. If you wanted to skip out on the family celebration you should have done so. If you wanted to be selfish and try to get the free meal, you, an adult in age, presumably with a mobile phone since they\u2019re fairly ubiquitous, could have called a taxi, a ride share, or even one of your friends to swing by and pick you up.\n\nInstead you chose to make everyone miserable by whining for a ride.

Clearly YTA. Even small children would look at this behaviour and see YTA.", "It really depends on how the exchange went with your dad on the phone. If he assured you that the dinner would be over in time to meet with your friends, then you're not the asshole. If he was under the impression that you were allowing the dinner to be the priority though, then you didn't communicate clearly enough and were leaving too much to chance. In that scenario, from their perspective, you then decided your friends were more important after agreeing to the dinner. I think in future you need to be clear on your decision and make clear boundaries as early as possible.", "Honestly, ESH! \n\nYou made other plans and they made no plans. \n\nShe decided last minute that she wanted to go to a restaurant and your dad and stepmom were like \"ok, bet, we'll invite the other kid who happens to be graduating too\" as a total after thought. And then, you already had plans with your friends, but for some reason decided that you were going to hop on board with this without actually thinking it through or planning properly for the time. So, you bail, it causes a huge commotion and upends the half-assed plan that they threw together like an hour prior, and instead of just like going along with it or figuring something else out or just being a little bit later at the restaurant, your dad throws a temper tantrum and gets into a fight with his wife over the entire thing so nobody ends up going?

You were in that car by your own choice, your selfishness literally derailed their night, your choice to go to the restaurant then immediately have your dad turn back around wasted your families time and you threw a fit about how wasting their time was really all about your time ????\n\nBut glad you didn\u2019t miss that super rare chance to see a sunset\u2026 next time tuck and roll so your dad won\u2019t have to stop the car.", "YTA did you think you were going to get to the restaurant and be seated, order, be served, eat and pay the bill in half an hour? On what was most likely a busy night because of\u2026local graduations? You should have never agreed to go if you still intended to make it to your original plan. I have to wonder if you did that on purpose or if you thought you had something to gain by going and when you realized that you didn\u2019t, you bailed and threw everyone\u2019s night down the toilet.", "I hope Stifler didn\u2019t show up to the sunset and totally kill the vibe. Best of luck trying to lose your v-card after prom, we\u2019re all rooting for you.", "YTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to get in the car with them.", "I understand you\u2019re still very young and a teenager so you\u2019re incredibly selfish, most of us were at that age. But YTA. You should\u2019ve never agreed to the dinner if you knew you really wanted to watch the sunset. You were a brat and very rude. You owe them all an apology.", "YTA", "u read this back to yourself and ask yourself whether or not you\u2019re the asshole", "YTA and you should apologize to your step sister, your dad and her Mom.", "YTA. Raising your voice and making everything about you? Yeah, bratty behavior, friend.\n\nBut you're 18. Hopefully you will grow up.", "YTA.", "YTA \n\nYou're a selfish brat. Don't make overlapping plans and don't be shitty with your parents for just trying to include you in a celebration.", "YTA. Narcissistic behavior.", "YTA!!!", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA, sorry. You decided to go but then changed your mind, causing them to have to drive you back.", "I understand how you feel, I get you were frustrated about the timing. I can imagine myself having a similar reaction at your age. However, it was not justified and it did ruin the night for your family. I\u2019m surprised your dad drove you back to the park, my parents would definitely not have done so and instead would have told me to stop throwing a tantrum honestly. YTA but I think it\u2019s a case of your age/emotions running high and not malice.", "So you had plans, canceled them for new plans, and then last minute canceled the new plan for the old plan? \n\nYou wasted your own time. YTA next time just stay firm on your \"no I have plans\" and don't make your poor planning everyone else's fault.", "Yta.", "YTA.  Why would you double-book yourself and expect your dad to chauffeur you around during that time, knowing he had plans?  That's just inconsiderate of everyone's time.", "You had other plans, but decided to go to the dinner. And had them drive you. You are old enough to know that means you very likely wouldn\u2019t make it back to the thing with your friends. But instead you ruined everyone else\u2019s evening by behaving like a spoiled child. \nYTA.", "YTA. What you did was incredibly immature and selfish. What the hell were you thinking?", "YTA\n\nThere will be other sunsets", "Your step sister is right, and she will remember this for the rest of her life. I doubt it took you the time of an entire dinner length to make it to the restaurant - were you going to make your entire family abandon their food halfway through eating to drive you home if your meal had run a little late? It may be time to sort out your priorities. YTA.", "YTA\n\nFirst, you agreed to go to the dinner knowing you had other plans.\n\nThen you actually got there and then made your dad turn around and leave. \n\nThen you threw a tantrum when your family pointed out how you were messing up the night. \n\nYou're not only the AH, but incredibly selfish and childish. \n\nYou owe your family an apology.", "YTA. Why\u2019d you decide to go to dinner if you were going to be with your friends?", "YTA - no question.", "YTA. My god teenagers suck sometimes.", "Sheesh\nI wonder how many times stepsister pulls last min things\nOr wanted to disrupt your evening \nEsh", "YTA - way to ruin everyone\u2019s night by being a flake to everyone - even your friends. Pick a plan and stick to it", "Wait... from the way you said things. \n\nDo you not live with your dad? Because you didn't know about the fight and he called you.\n\nSo, they came to your house to pick you up (delaying their dinner to do so), turned around once they got to the restaurant (delaying the dinner again) drove you back to your house (where you slammed the door on them because they had the nerve to delay their own dinner significantly to take you to a place you had no intention of eating at and then back home?)\n\nYou had to have done this just to upset your stepsister. Is there an actual legitimate reason you hate her? Why couldn't you have gotten an uber from the restaurant or had someone pick you up? Why couldn't you drive? Why was \"make sure my dad, stepmom, and stepsis have a severely delayed dinner that I don't intend to participate in\" the only option?\n\nAt least the sunset was nice, because 100% YTA.", "I would of made you uber.  yta", "YTA. You already had plans and made someone else who invited you change their plans because you believed your were more important. She had something to celebrate too! You sound like an entitled brat/toddler. Tell us how you feel about your family without telling us how you feel.", "YTA", "YTA\nYou got main character syndrome or what ?", "YTA. Are you aware that there's a sunset every day?", "You waited for everyone to get together and get to the actual location and THEN decided to throw a fit and make everyone have to leave again? You can't always do both things, and severely inconveniencing a group of people (your family) because you don't know how long it takes to travel and eat is inconsiderate and selfish.\n\nThe sun sets every day. YTA", "You were selfish and self centered.  Took no one else\u2019s feelings into consideration and yelled at your father. You agreed to go to the dinner and then once there wanted to go be with your friends. Ruined the dinner for everyone while not apologizing or showing any remorse", "YTA. You made them drive you home when you were already at the restaurant, you slammed the door, and yelled? \nHow could you not realize you're the a*hole?!", "YTA. Good luck in the real world with such an awful, entitled attitude.", "Info: why did you decide to go to the dinner at all? This can\u2019t be the first meal you\u2019ve ever eaten so you had to have known you wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to both.", "Yeah, what an asshole move. Why not just go with the friends to begin with, why make a big fuss about ruining the evening for everyone? Sounds like sabotage to me. \n\nAnd why on earth didn't the father still bring them to dinner?", "YTA and I can answer that because she didn\u2019t want stepsister to have any of her spot light on her graduation. She wanted to prove to everyone her dad would choose what she wanted over everyone else.", "Yup.  Stepsister said what we're all thinking.", "I'm actually wondering if other family members were supposed to be at this dinner. \n\nYou know, maybe some aunties and uncles, a few cousins, maybe the grandparents and family friends. The cynical part of me is wondering if OP thought there would be some graduation cash for her if she attended the dinner. \n\nBut on the way there, she either decided that friends trumps cash (should have figured that out earlier, and not at the expense of other's time), or learned that it was just a small family celebration, so no monies to be had. \n\nThat, or OP thought it would be a short dinner that she could dip out on early, and got annoyed that no one else was hurrying along.", "Not only that but you can literally catch a sunset any good ole day.", "Judge, jury,\n\nExcretioner ??? Lmao what ???", "The fact that he agreed to drive her back is the reason him and SM fought for sure. Bet she rarely hears \"No\" from dad and SM is sick of it. Why couldn't these friends pick her up from the restaurant? Why did she agree at all. Personally I would've told her that she needed to find a ride and went inside to have dinner.", "Ah yes, because step siblings aren't people and therefore are not allowed to have feelings /s. What an immature take, trying growing up.", "Where on earth are you getting this from? The implication that the stepsister is the favorite here is utterly absurd, considering it's clear that the father blatantly favors OP and they both completely ruined the stepsister's graduation dinner.", "I may be reading it wrong, but it sounds like the OP's father and his wife got into an argument over it, and they ended up not going. \n\nWhich was, pretty much, the OP's plan.", "How was she going to dip out early if she had no car? She would've had to make everyone leave, too.", "She dipped out before they even got into the restaurant", "Yep. You can even leave the restaurant for a few minutes and just look up in the sky.", "I didn\u2019t chose it, poop themed titles are one of the quirks of this sub! \ud83d\ude02", "Its kind of telling that OP wasn't even aware of the plans until the last minute that her family isn't considerate of her. She being accused of ruining her stepsisters celebration when both of them graduated that day? Why wasn't she included in any of the planning? \n\nEvery comment so far is ignoring that part. I'd be kind of bitter and pissy too.", "My thoughts too. I think this was a power move. Meant to upstage the stepsister. But I am jaded and think the worse of everyone", "I meant that she was so self-centered and bad at estimating times that she thought dinner would be only half an hour, everyone would be done (because she wanted to be done quickly), then she could make it on time to watch the sunset.\n  \nBut the world conspired against her!\n  \nI wonder what exactly \"took so long\".\n  \nWas it traffic that caused them to take longer than usual to get to the restaurant?\n  \nOr maybe, it was photos and crowds of congratulations for the stepsister, and OP got annoyed.", "I don\u2019t have any issue with her not wanting to go to dinner and choosing her friends in this case. My issue is the back tracking. She decided to go to dinner for whatever reason but then decided it was taking too long? The fact that her Dad drove her to her friends shows me he wasn\u2019t opposed to her hanging with friends so I want to know why she told both groups yes. Did she really think that would work out? Had she said he forced her to go that would be one thing. Had she said no to begin with, fine. But she didn\u2019t so I\u2019m confused at what she expected to happen"]}
