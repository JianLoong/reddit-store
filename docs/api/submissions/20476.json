She is abusing you and if I were in your situation I would way away. She does not respect you", "NTA\n\nDude, seriously, WTF.  You have bigger issues here than whether you do or do not take back an Xbox.

OP needs to get out until she\u2019s been sober for at least 1 year of continuous sobriety but I suspect it\u2019s the end, she sounds like she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s change worthy behavior yet.", "Admittedly she's not an alcoholic..she just chooses to drink wine which really doesn't agree with her! Give her a rum and coke and she's good as gold.", "Unless there is a custody agreement in place pretty sure you can\u2019t be charged with kidnapping.  Talk to a lawyer.  If you have a child in this environment it is not good for the child either.", "Since there is a kid involved, you need to start documenting as much as possible about her behavior. There will eventually be a custody dispute if you decide to leave (and you should protect your child from this behavior if she isn\u2019t willing to get help) and having these records will bolster your case. But, if you\u2019re the bio father and this is in the US you cannot be charged for kidnapping your own child whom you have custody of (which you do in the absence of a court order or agreement that you don\u2019t have custody). Get a lawyer.", "It is really hard to see all the signs while you are still in it. Her behaviour is not ok, and I think you know it isn't. You have gotten good advice on this comment so far. I want to add that you can (and in my opinion should) contact a DV centre in your area for more extensive support and advice. They will be happy to listen.\n\nI want to stress again that she appears to have a drinking problem, she could easily choose not to drink wine and not become enraged at you, she chooses to anyway, and she is still responsible for her behaviour when inebriated especially knowing this is the effect.\n\nI also want to point out if all this behaviour is new she may be suffering with post-partum depression. In that case she needs to see a doctor asap.\n\nEven if it is either of these or other reasons you still won't be the AH if you decide to leave or take a break over this even if she does get treatment. You deserve to feel safe and to know your child is safe around her.", "Call a lawyer. Strat documenting her unhinged behaviour. There is a way to do this but only under a lawyers guidance. Don\u2019t take legal advice from a drunk abuser. She doesn\u2019t know what she is talking about. Get a professional.", "You need to start documenting what happens in your house! \nWhen she's drunk, how she speaks to you and the baby etc. \n\nMake sure to do it in secret though. \nYou need to work on getting you and the baby out. \nIs there some \n\nIs there a hotline, crisis center or something like that where you live? \nBecause this is abuse", "Lawyer up and document anything and everything.", "So you need to be MORE motivated to get away and get as much custody as possible. Your parent is going to do this kind of shit to the baby too.", "Threatening to your report you to the police for trying to leave and take your child out of the situation is also abusive as fuck. Not only is she an angry, abusive alcoholic, it also seems like she's willing to try to hold anything against you to get her way. You really do need to look into finding a way out of this both for your own sake and especially for your child's. \n\nAre you really okay with your child growing up in an abusive household? If she is this way to you, there is an extremely high chance she'll be the same way to your kid as they start to get older.", "Continuing to drink alcohol even though it is harmful to the people they love and their relationships is a literal symptom of alcohol use disorder.", "Still an alcoholic my friend.", "If you\u2019re unmarried in my state, the father doesn\u2019t have rights unless he\u2019s legitimated by the court, otherwise anyone could claim to be the father.

And if you can please get some help to be able to leave that relationship. It's not healthy at all for you. Relationships are for partners who lift each other up not blackmail and tear down the partners.", "NTA. Run. Run far and run fast, this will not get any better.", "She wants you to take it because she is embarrassed about her actions also she wants to play the \"take it away\" game. 1st take it back and tell her the next time she threatens you. You will give it to her and never take it back. 2nd you don't need to be abused by \nher. Drinking isn't excuse.

She's being an abusive drunk, and then blaming you for her behavior", "NTA - get the fuck away from this person they are emotionally and financially abusive", "Nta Break up with her, she crazy crazy.", "NTA. Just end things with her. She is an alcoholic with an anger problem. You can do better", "INFO - why is she threatening to take it away? Is it interfering with quality time or intimacy? Are you parked in front of it every spare minute? Or is she just lording it over you over something completely unrelated?", "INFO: Why are you still with her?

Better to just take the high-road and leave her without it.", "Are you kidding? That\u2019s even more reason to leave. What happens when she starts being an abusive drunk to your child?", "As a parent, it is your responsibility to protect your child from abusive environments. Do the right thing and lawyer up. NTA!", "Walking away with the baby is now essential. Anyone who holds your child hostage to keep you in a relationship, is not someone you want to be in a relationship with. \n\nPlease document everything and record all the times she becomes abusive under the influence of alcohol. Please keep all messages she sends you that clearly document her controlling and emotionally threatening behaviour towards you. \n\nReach out to charities that support partners in abusive relationships. They will be able to advise you on how to end this relationship and keep your baby safe. \n\nAll the best of luck", "If the cops get called, tell em about the drinking and how you no longer feel safer in the same home.

He should cut his losses and run.", "no one likes a mean drunk.", "Hard to tell she\u2019s an alcoholic which changes your brain but that\u2019s why OP should wait a full year and see where she is then she may just be mean but the addiction may have also caused it and it gets better she may too especially if she works a program of recovery which encourages personal responsibility and growth", "That would be very noble of him, but he's not an A if he decides to leave. You don't owe abusive people anything. Besides, she might be going through a hard time, but it doesn't justify her behaviour. Alcoholism is hard, but it is not an excuse for abuse. But I admire your empathy for her. Very kind of you.", "I completely agree but I wouldn\u2019t even attempt until Al that point she won\u2019t get help if OP puts up with it she has no incentive to even try yet", "If OP gives her a second chance, he's a much better human being than most of us.", "I hope he gets some counseling himself to figure out why he puts up with it so he doesn\u2019t make the same choices in the future"]}
