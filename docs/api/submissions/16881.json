At the current moment, I do week on week off and switch on Mondays. It has been this way since around my early teens.\n\nRecently, I came home on a Monday and C said he wanted to talk about something. He asked me if I wanted to change from Monday swap over day to Friday swap over day as they believe it would be more convenient for them and that he thinks we would be able to enjoy the weekend more and do more things during the week. I said no and he said for me to think about it. I think Monday is the most practical swap over day and it's the one that I am used to. \n\nI then come home to face the usual Monday interrogation from B who talks about the issue and says the Friday swap over day is a requirement rather than a suggestion. An argument ensures and my step mum accuses me of being selfish and says she made sacrifices for me so I should start making sacrifices for her. \n\nI point about that the change in swap over day timetable would also have to be consented to by V and their demand puts me in a precarious position. I also point out that many things happen on a Friday and would make it more difficult to do things on a Friday. I pointed that my involvement in a political party which organises events on a Friday. This results in her changing it to a Thursday swap over day which is less terrible than Friday but still worse than Monday. \n\nLater that night, I suggest I would prefer to just be at their house for a weekend from a Thursday to a Monday as that would be less disruptive. B proceeds to go on a verbal tirade against me saying that Thursday to Thursday is the only acceptable schedule. At the end of the night, I get blamed for causing arguments even though they decided to make controversial demands on a Monday night. I am then left worrying about how to tell V about their demands for the rest of the week. She did reluctantly agree to Thursday to Thursday.", "created_utc": 1683723972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dq3wd/aita_for_objecting_to_the_day_change_demanded_by/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Agree to the change or get your own transport, either way grow TF up.  YTA", "This is understandable but I still think you need to make a decision about a single home right now and keep to that. I understand both sides have arguments against this but I think you should choose and then just put your foot down. Hopefully you will be in your own place soon so this is just for the foreseeable future whilst you work at getting a job. I think you and the entire family will feel more settled if you choose a place", "What conclusion(s) do you think I jumped to?", "You are not trying to make things work as shown by refusal to agree to their terms for transportation dates.  You are acting like a spoiled child who wants things her way.", "sounds like it\u2019s time to move somewhere cheaper.", "That kind of makes sense but also kind of doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s nice that you\u2019re so close with her that she wants to do that to spend time witb you, but again I don\u2019t see why changing the days would cause such a big shift", "If only I had the opportunity.", "Ideally I can move out soon.", "I've never completely gotten along with all my parents. It's more an example of why Friday is inconvenient.", "Was in university until last year.", "I have a savings account with a bit of money in it.. They offered to help me in the initial stages of moving out and I was in the process of looking for work at the time.", "If I had to choose, it would be my mums. She is less likely to kick me out. She said no for now but I may be able to change her mind with some time. Hopefully if I get some luck with a job, I can just move out.", "Like a lot of people and myself included, she views Monday as the beginning of the week and Monday to Monday as planning blocks.", "Take some responsibility for yourself, jfc.", "This is a cop out. YTA. You\u2019re an adult. That\u2019s their house.", "No its not. It doesnt explain at all why friday is inconvenient\u2026..\n\nThats like saying friday is inconvenient cause thats when i go to movie night.  How does it affect going out", "Ok, how have you not found a f/t job in a year?", "Where do you live (no need to be too specific)? Is the cost of living really high? Is the job market bad?", "If you get through this on boarding process with the new job you can always assure her that you will only be staying with her whilst you look for your own place, hopefully this will reassure her. Best of luck", "Ok\u2026..so why doesn\u2019t she just put in her plan that she\u2019ll see you Thursday or whatever it is? I still don\u2019t see why this is an issue. I get the feeling someone, not sure who, gets extremely overdramatic about small changes. Not sure if it\u2019s you that over reacts or if you\u2019re just pre-reacting because you know V over reacts", "My opportunities were literally restricted by the government during the pandemic. It isn't completely my fault. I keep applying for jobs but keep getting rejected. My country has a very high minimum wage which makes it difficult to get into the workplace unless I have a billion years experience.", "Amen to that!!!", "Who are threatening my place at the other house with their demands.", "Have you tried getting a full-time job recently, my dude? It\u2019s not as easy as you think.", "Took me 6 months to find a full time job after uni, delivered pizza and worked bar till I found one. Its really difficult to get your 1st full time job.", "Rental market is difficult and job market not the greatest. Where I live has a high minimum wage so places are more hesitant to take on new people. I guess the cost of living here is high.", "I like schedules and predictability. The Monday to Monday is a built in routine for me and the forced change to the routine is frustrating for me. She also likes the Monday to Monday. I don't like unexpected surprises and I knew that my mum wouldn't be happy about the change. Especially if it is also forced on her.", "All you are doing is making excuse after excuse and not acknowledging that you can do something yourself to change your situation. Your parents are NTA to ask their fully grown adult daughter to do something to make their lives easier.", "My cousin is 2 years younger than you and held a job during the pandemic while also going to school. You absolutely can find a job, maybe not the one you WANT right now, but you can find a job you just don\u2019t want to. MANY people go to school and have a job. If you don\u2019t need to then great, but you\u2019re a grown ass adult not even in school. It doesn\u2019t take a year to find a job. Grow up and take accountability for yourself, this is just embarrassing.", "Volunteer. Find a mentor. Access job search supports (your uni would probably help).", "At 22 you should have a place that isn't your parents house. \n\nGrow up.", "Then move. By 22, I had a full time job and was living in an apartment with my boyfriend across the country from my parents without any parental support besides being on their insurance plan. You aren\u2019t helpless.", "Yea you guys need to learn to go with the flow more. You can literally still plan monday to monday and go somewhere else halfway through the week. Just put it in the calendar that you\u2019re going. It really is not that hard, and if it is you should seek out therapy (not trying to be rude, but genuinely something is wayyy too rigid in your way of thinking and there\u2019s probably a reason why)", "It's more they are putting me in a position that could put me in conflict with my mother who like me, likes the Monday to Monday arrangement.", "Humm, in an hypothetical defense of OP, as I do not know the real situation,I would point out that it might not be excuses but the real situation of her country. That is, there are several countries with a less flexible job market than the US.\n\nHeck, in my own european country several university-educated young people spend years without being able to get a first job after university. Because they are considered as too much educated for low-paying jobs, and without actual practical experience for degree-related jobs. So, they can spend a couple of years waiting for a literal lucky break. Here, the average age for leaving the parental home is also over 30 years.\n\nThat is all to say that OP's actual situation, considering her country, might not be so bad as it could be considered in some countries"]}
