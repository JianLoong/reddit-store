At the current moment, I do week on week off and switch on Mondays. It has been this way since around my early teens.\n\nRecently, I came home on a Monday and C said he wanted to talk about something. He asked me if I wanted to change from Monday swap over day to Friday swap over day as they believe it would be more convenient for them and that he thinks we would be able to enjoy the weekend more and do more things during the week. I said no and he said for me to think about it. I think Monday is the most practical swap over day and it's the one that I am used to. \n\nI then come home to face the usual Monday interrogation from B who talks about the issue and says the Friday swap over day is a requirement rather than a suggestion. An argument ensures and my step mum accuses me of being selfish and says she made sacrifices for me so I should start making sacrifices for her. \n\nI point about that the change in swap over day timetable would also have to be consented to by V and their demand puts me in a precarious position. I also point out that many things happen on a Friday and would make it more difficult to do things on a Friday. I pointed that my involvement in a political party which organises events on a Friday. This results in her changing it to a Thursday swap over day which is less terrible than Friday but still worse than Monday. \n\nLater that night, I suggest I would prefer to just be at their house for a weekend from a Thursday to a Monday as that would be less disruptive. B proceeds to go on a verbal tirade against me saying that Thursday to Thursday is the only acceptable schedule. At the end of the night, I get blamed for causing arguments even though they decided to make controversial demands on a Monday night. I am then left worrying about how to tell V about their demands for the rest of the week. She did reluctantly agree to Thursday to Thursday.", "created_utc": 1683723972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dq3wd/aita_for_objecting_to_the_day_change_demanded_by/", "score": 497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you have a history of executive function problems?", "Or move to moms full time?", "And in other posts it\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re 18, they don\u2019t owe you housing anymore\u201d", "I'm 28 and I don't feel like an adult \ud83d\ude2d", "Eh, my bar is the scientific data on brain formation. Between 15-25, the prefrontal cortex is undergoing massive development and is not fully functional yet. This, I give younger \"adults\" a lot of leeway because they're making long term decisions while the long-term thinking part of their brain  isn't even fully online yet, but the people on the opposite side of those agreements and legally binding contracts *do* have full function in that region. Student loans at 18 is extremely predatory IMO for exactly that reason. They're still relying on older adults to be honest and fair in their advice, and that's fucking them over left and right until they're old enough to start making better predictions about the downstream effects of their actions. \n\nPeople from 15-25 quite literally cannot primarily think with the rational part of the brain. \n\nThat said, if you're a young adult and you don't like your parents' rules, move into a living situation where you're at least stable, if not happy. Changing what the homeowner thinks is rarely successful, especially if they're used to treating you like a young child.", "Same thoughts. It seems like the parents are task burdened by her lack of independence.", "You do know that there are lots of countries in which the average age of leaving the parental home, by choice and/or economic reasons, is at late 20s/early 30s, right?\n\nFor all we know, leaving at 22 could be extremely early in her own country.", "Yes. OP sounds very immature, and she doesn't seem to be making any moves into adulthood. I think this living arrangement is part of why. OP, did you have friends in college? Did people know you were still functioning as a minor with regard to your parents?", "Depending on the renting market, it may not be enough...", "Nah OP is acting like all young adults where she lives. I live in the same country. It is very normal for adult children to live with the family while going to university and moving out once they have a stable job in their field of study. Some don\u2019t move out until they can afford a home. We have one of the most expensive property markets in the world.\n\nWe also had strict government regulations during the pandemic making it near impossible for young people not already in employment to get a job during this period so I can understand that it is taking OP longer to get a break in their industry.", "Wait, you aren't working at *all* right now? How long has it been since you graduated?", "It's a workers market right now. Everywhere is hiring. Widen your application scope. Any job in the short term is better than no job in the long term.", "What is your degree in?", "Yeah this sub is wild lol", "That's fair lol. But it doesn't change the fact that you are. I'm going to be 40 in 2 weeks and still don't feel like I fit the adult mold. But still. We are.", "Then it is Thursday to Thursday. You are an adult. They are letting you live with them. Either play by their rules or stop with the extra curricular activities and put your energy into getting a job and a roommate.", "The point is you need to stop living in two places.  You\u2019re not a child.  Pick one and visit the other.", "How about act like the adult you are so your mom don\u2019t consider you a child. I\u2019d also be pissed if my 22 yo lived with me but expected child treatment.", "Yes absolutely like mine. But I'd add that we're not as vocal about disagreeing with our parents. If we're living under their roof, unless it's something about our health/life/jobs that we're responsible for, what they say (mainly fathers) goes. I have a job which is nowhere good enough to love separately but since I'm living with my parents, their plans or decisions regarding the family even as small as them going out would be according to them. Not me. And I'm alright with it. The least I can do is respect their rules when they're still putting me up. So I wouldn't ever be refusing what my father tells me to do, which seems OP's dad asked rather than demanded the first time", "YTA if trying to make things work does not involve compromise. Thursday is a fine compromise.", "It\u2019s most certainly not enough. And OP has a degree, those jobs don\u2019t want to hire people with a degree. Leave the degree off the resume and they\u2019ll wonder why someone at 22 has little to no job history.", "Rent a room, you don't have to have an entire apartment.", "Well, you don't have a job...so, you could live anywhere", "YOU ARE AN ADULT. You have been an adult for 4 years. Of course, they expect you to work out details with your mother. They have no reason to talk to her.", "Are they involved in transport? Why does the day affect either of them?", "Ahh this comment makes it more of a ESH situation as they are using you to make changes to the arrangement without wanting to own up to the other party that it is their want/need not OPs.", "Because when you turn adult, the renting market magically get better, and you instantly get good paying jobs, right?....", "It\u2019s not always that easy. Service jobs don\u2019t always want people with degrees. Leaving the degree off the resume can result in them wondering why a 20 something has no work history. Its fucked.", "It's wild that different people have different opinions?", "How do we know the OP can afford to move out?", "Not everyone has this option. Shut the fuck up about moving out.", "For the record, I also was not able to save any money and be ready when the pandemic was over to move back out of my parents house. It\u2019s not that easy.", "I waited tables five years ago with a degree and made enough to pay rent with a roommate.", "And moving is free now?", "these, I find it very ridiculous that most Americans criticize someone for not moving at 18, when there are many factors to consider why you can't, I think they are just people abandoned by everyone or privileged", "Also not sure you understand the difference between an opinion and a fact. Let me help with an example. \n\nOpinion: \"22 is hardly an adult tbh\" \n\nFact: 22 IS an adult", "[removed]", "Op 1) would be best served by moving out 2) provided no reasons they can't move out 3) said they're actively trying to move out.", "That was 5 years ago.", "Cool. Call up all the grocery stores and restaurants I\u2019ve applied to and ask them to hire me since it worked for you.", "\u201cI have a lot of savings\u201d \n\nliving with your parents rent free for your entire adult live has its perks. \ud83e\udd70", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Finding a job where you can support yourself can be difficult and take time in many areas.  Yes, I'm sure OP could get a fast food job or something but that would not enable them to support themselves.  They need something with career potential which can take time to get.", "Dude who the fuck are you to be grilling this young woman? The way you are speaking to this person about finding work is wrong plus it is none of your damn business.", "Entire adult life? It\u2019s been 4 years and she\u2019s been in uni. It\u2019s great she has savings and she should use it but money doesn\u2019t go so far anymore and moving is expensive. Moving and finding a place to live? I don\u2019t know if her savings are enough for that.", "Not something to joke about.", "Go work in a kitchen/as a server. You don't need experience for that. Frankly, with each of your comments, you come off as denying any personal responsibility and seem to think that your wants as a 22 year old adult outweigh those of the three adults who are PAYING YOUR WAY AND DRIVING YOU AROUND. I'm sorry, but if ALL of the parents in this situation are put off by this arrangement, I think it's time to face facts that they are sick of this arrangement and being responsible for you, who is -again- and ADULT.\n\n\nYTA. Be a grown up, get over the fact that you're not getting your way and go with the arrangements your parents have made, and get a job and start saving for your own place in the meantime. The audacity and entitlement you have is astounding. Do better.", "Jfc OP, YTA. Guess what, I\u2019m your age, my opportunities were also restricted by the pandemic, and have degrees in very specific and competitive fields with very few job opportunities. Yet I STILL managed to find a job in a related field with the skills I have and now pay for my own apartment. You can absolutely apply for jobs that may require more experience and frame your youth and fresh ideas as a plus for the job. You\u2019re just making excuses.", "Even if you didn\u2019t cause all your problems you are the only one who can solve them. \nI guess this seems really juvenile. I worked full time when I went to university because there were no other options. Take some responsibility for yourself.", "You kidding?  Service industries are all hiring.", "Walk into literally any fast food place and get hired full time on the spot. I know because I\u2019ve been doing it for a decade. Not a great job but you\u2019ll get the hours you want and there will always be shifts available", "What is your degree in?", "she literally said she is planning to move in the post i\u2019m responding to. \n\nwhy are you going so hard about a think that you (admittedly) don\u2019t know.", "I come from the same country as OP. Even though I find it odd that they are still following the custody agreement I would agree that it would be near impossible for them to move out at the moment. Rents are at an all time high with vacancies sitting at about 1%. It\u2019s also not uncommon for adult children to stay with their families through out university and until they get a steady income. Some don\u2019t even move out until mid 20s. \n\nOP YTA for not being more flexible. As an adult you need to take on responsibility at home to be a more considerate family member. If it hasn\u2019t been an issue for your mum then you need to go with the flow with your dad. If it doesn\u2019t work out you can always switch back to the Mondays.", "They\u2019re hiring but then don\u2019t give you hours. I specifically went for service industries because of this and not a single one offered me more than twenty hours a week and usually I got less than fifteen. It\u2019s not that easy to just \u201cget a job\u201d.", "america is so weird"]}
