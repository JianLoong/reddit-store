At the current moment, I do week on week off and switch on Mondays. It has been this way since around my early teens.\n\nRecently, I came home on a Monday and C said he wanted to talk about something. He asked me if I wanted to change from Monday swap over day to Friday swap over day as they believe it would be more convenient for them and that he thinks we would be able to enjoy the weekend more and do more things during the week. I said no and he said for me to think about it. I think Monday is the most practical swap over day and it's the one that I am used to. \n\nI then come home to face the usual Monday interrogation from B who talks about the issue and says the Friday swap over day is a requirement rather than a suggestion. An argument ensures and my step mum accuses me of being selfish and says she made sacrifices for me so I should start making sacrifices for her. \n\nI point about that the change in swap over day timetable would also have to be consented to by V and their demand puts me in a precarious position. I also point out that many things happen on a Friday and would make it more difficult to do things on a Friday. I pointed that my involvement in a political party which organises events on a Friday. This results in her changing it to a Thursday swap over day which is less terrible than Friday but still worse than Monday. \n\nLater that night, I suggest I would prefer to just be at their house for a weekend from a Thursday to a Monday as that would be less disruptive. B proceeds to go on a verbal tirade against me saying that Thursday to Thursday is the only acceptable schedule. At the end of the night, I get blamed for causing arguments even though they decided to make controversial demands on a Monday night. I am then left worrying about how to tell V about their demands for the rest of the week. She did reluctantly agree to Thursday to Thursday.", "created_utc": 1683723972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dq3wd/aita_for_objecting_to_the_day_change_demanded_by/", "score": 2798, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What precarious position would you be in??", "EDIT: Have since taken a look at OPs comment history (as suggested by u/Moodybeachphoto \\- thanks!) and I change my judgement - DEFINITELY the asshole. At first I was super sympathetic, as you can see in my original reply below: dealing with divorced parents is incredibly difficult, and even more so when you're coming back from college and are trying to navigate being a different person in your old life.\n\nHOWEVER, seeing some of OPs comments on other posts has definitely changed my tune. OP has said that they barely put any time towards the job search (so, what are you doing all day?) and being very particular about the kind of job they want - not because of qualifications, but because apparently OP \"dreads an office job\". Like...grow up? You have an education, you live rent free, and complain about not being able to afford your own place when you have made no significant effort to actually do anything about it. So you hate the concept of an office job. I think *most* people do, but sometimes beggars can't be choosers.\n\nSo of course your parents don't feel the need to rearrange their schedule for you, or to go out of their way to coordinate with their ex-spouse. Why would they, when you have *nothing* that you are doing??\n\nI really wanted to feel sympathy for you, but the AHolery was too strong.

I don't know what that protocol is and I couldn't find it in the FAQ!!!)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEveryone asking why at 22 the OP still goes by the custody agreement CLEARLY did not grow up with divorced parents.\n\nFirst of all, when you get into a routine for over a decade, you start building your life and schedule around that routine. How far away are your parents house? Do you have some activities that can only be done when at one house, versus another? These are all things that can be incredibly stressful to try and rearrange, for what seems to be because? Dad and SM want to?\n\nPlus, let us not even get into how difficult it is to try and coordinate schedules between people who actively don't want to talk to each other, meaning you're the go between for something that you don't even want to do in the first place. Divorced parents are more like *children* than adults when they have to agree on something.\n\n~~NTA~~!!

Student loans at 18 is extremely predatory IMO for exactly that reason.

The the argument is over changing the current schedule which one parent wants and me and the other parent oppose.

I think the idea of a 22 year old still moving between houses is so odd most people aren\u2019t really looking at all the different sides of the conflict. Your Dad and Stepmom wanting to change the arrangement with very little reason why seems odd and more than a little suspect. \n\nMany people reading into this and seeing entitlement. I\u2019m reading between the lines and seeing a kid who has had two toxic and unstable homes, although in very different ways, for a large part of their life. The fact that neither home is one you would want to live in full time is very telling. That you mention keeping a foot in both houses to reduce the chances of you ending up homeless is also very telling. Your SM telling you she has made sacrifices for you now it is time for you to sacrifice for her is not ok. I\u2019m surprised no one else is commenting on how inappropriate that is! OP it seems like you have been put in the middle of your parents battles and used against each other for a long time. I\u2019m sorry you are stuck in this crappy situation. \n\nIf you were still a kid and one parent wanted to change the arrangement they would need to talk to the other parent about it. Even though you aren\u2019t a kid, they still shouldn\u2019t be using you as a go between. I can\u2019t understand why your dad and SM think Friday is a better day than Monday, especially since you move between houses on your own. This just screams controlling to me. How much time do you spend doing things with them that this really effects them at all? My 23 yr old still lives with us for many of the same reasons you still live at home. His comings and goings hardly have any impact on us. All we ask is a heads up if he has other plans for supper and to know when he is leaving so we know if we hear the dogs doing something they shouldn\u2019t, we have to handle it rather than assuming he is there and dealing with it. \n\nI wish I had good advice to give. All I can say is try and not let them put you in the middle anymore. If you had reasonable parents, I would say you could have told your dad that your mom needed to be a part of this conversation, that they couldn\u2019t unilaterally demand a change with out realizing it involved another person, but I don\u2019t think you have reasonable parents and trying to have a conversation the 4 of you would have been awful. Hopefully you and your mom can live with Thursdays once you get use to it. Even more hopefully you find a job soon that lets you get out of this situation! Good luck!", "I live in Australia, and I know many Uni students whose parents are divorced.  As you said, it not unusual for students or other young people to continue to live with their parents.  I've never known any that continued to follow a custody agreement schedule after they aged out of the requirement.  \n\nIf one household is giving you agro, stay permanently at the other.  If you Mum asks for rent, it is a reasonable request.  If your Dad and Stepmum are willing to let you live there rent-free, you won't have to move weekly.  It might be annoying to listen to stepmum's rant, but free rent is free rent.\n\nEither way, you are not required to uproot yourself weekly.  You can stop at anytime, you are not your parents property.  If you really like the arrangement,  you should just agree to do your weekly swap on Thursday/Friday.", "Thank you for the advice.
