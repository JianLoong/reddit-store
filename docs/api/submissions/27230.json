(4-5 trips in total)\n\n\nThe thing is, I have gone on a couple of trips with them in the past and didn't have the best time. The reason being that most of them (at least the vocal majority) plan the trips around socialising, taking pictures, and visiting every place they can in the time frame. On the contrary, I prefer to have a more silent and less hectic schedule, just a plain and simple viewing experience. I don't really mind missing a few places, so I could take in everything from what's been offered in the places that I actually visited.\n\n\nFor example, a couple of years ago, we went on a trip towards the coast. We were staying near this absolutely gorgeous, almost uncrowded beach that I was basically spellbound by. My friends wanted to go for water activities/sports that were on a beach an hour away from the place we were staying. I decided not to go, as I wasn't done with the place. And they went without me. I spent almost the whole day going for a swim and basically sitting and lying on the beach. It felt otherworldly and peaceful.\n\n\nLater, my friends arrived around the evening, and one of them said that we had come to this trip as a group, and I shouldn't kill other people's mood for my pretentious interests. Look, I know I am a pretentious cunt, but I'm not just going to visit a place and not do what I want to do there. I spent the next few days doing what the group was planning to do, but it just wasn't my thing.\n\n\nTo me, it was simple: I can't make a group trip about myself, but a trip without that, just doesn't appeal to me. So, to not ruin anyone else's time, I just prefer not to go. At first I made excuses for why I wouldn't be able to go, but later I simply communicated what it actually was, and I was criticised for living in my perfect social bubble and that I have to adjust certain stuff for friends. And I'm against this idea.

I teach my 3 year old this. \"Its ok to like different things! We all have different bodies and minds and we can like things or not like things and that's ok!\" Seems like they never got that lesson.
