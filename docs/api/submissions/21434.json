He lost his job in the tech sector and we decided to contribute 50% of our take out to the account to pay for shared expenses like groceries, rent, utilities etc. He makes $1800 a month take home in unemployment and I take home $5600 a month since I still have my job. So he contributes around $900 and I contribute $2800 a month. Our rent is $2200 our utilities $200 and our groceries $400 so we should have some left over each month. \n\nI haven\u2019t checked what is taken out of the bank account until 2 times it over-drafted. I got a call to add overdraft protection and said I wouldn\u2019t need it and the bank person said it overdrafted twice and I was charged $35 each time so I should be adding overdraft protection. I checked the bank statements and sure enough I had $30 in there. I checked the transactions and they had all been venmoed into my bf\u2019s account. \n\nI confronted him when he got home and asked where the money went. He said it was in his account and he was using it to pay our shared expenses. I pointed out I bought the groceries, utilities were on autopay and I also venmoed our landlord every month so what bills are there to pay? He kept saying our shared expenses and refused to elaborate. I demanded receipts and he called me paranoid and refused to talk about it any further. After several days of trying to get the answers I\u2019ve had enough.\n\nI called the bank to close the account and I\u2019ve told my bf Im moving out at the end of August (end of lease) if he doesn\u2019t cough up the money. By my estimate he stole $2700 from our joint account and about $1800 of it was mine. He still refuses to tell me where the money went and calls me money hungry when I point out it\u2019s mostly my money that\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve told my landlord Im leaving and he can\u2019t afford the place alone so he will need to move. I\u2019ve also done a credit check on my credit because now I don\u2019t feel like I can\u2019t trust him. But am I being too harsh? We\u2019ve been together for 2 years and we haven\u2019t shared finances at all until this point?", "created_utc": 1688577713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rh6mm/aita_for_closing_the_shared_bank_account_and/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seeing as how he is refusing to tell you where that money went, he's definitely hiding something. The fact that you instantly went to closing the account and moving out means that your gut is telling you something and you are right in trusting your instinct.\n\nIf he wasn't doing anything wrong or worth hiding, he wouldn't have issue 1 with proving his innocence. But the fact that he has resorted to name calling (paranoid, money hungry...), He is deflecting and gaslighting, making it seem as though you are mentally unhinged. It's good that you've seen this now instead of years down the road when you have a mortgage, marriage and kids tangled up into the mix as well.", "NTA!!!! I'd be leaving too.\n\nLesson-learned: When you have a joint account, check it weekly, if not daily. Me, I wouldn't open up a joint account with a bf. Even husband and I only have a joint account for the rent. The rest of our money goes into our own accounts and we decided how to split the rest of the expenses. Ie. I pay utilites and he pays our car payments, etc. split equitably not equally.", "Nta\n\nCongratulations for confronting an issue and reacting immediately and appropriately to it.  He is a thief, a liar, and a coward.  You don't need to know anything else. \n\nJust be sure to remove yourself formally from the lease and notify your landlord and your boyfriend in writing.    He sounds exactly like the kind of guy who would stop paying rent and try to pin it on you.  \n\n Id also text or email him in writing and try to get him to admit he took the money and will pay you back and try to get him to pay a small amount toward it and agree to payments, even if he can only give you $100 towards it.  I think paying toward a debt assumes responsibility for it and you can take him to small claims for the rest.  I also assume you didn't take out joint cards and he didn't add you to his? Id freeze my credit info too just in case and also try to run a credit check on him if possible - just don't break the law.\n\nBut change your passwords asap.  Pissed off IT people can be sneaky.so be careful.   The good thing is, some IT jobs require deep background checks so it may come up down the road for him if you filed a court case or the landlord evicts him.", "NTA.   He stole from you and lied about it and then resorted to name calling.  He can't be trusted.", "Keep those ducks of yours in a row, and just keep going! \n\nNTA", "NTA at all.  Your bf cannot be trusted.  You have to protect yourself.  No matter what he's doing with that money, he is hiding something from you.  And you're right, he is stealing from your joint account.  It's good you're getting out of there ASAP.", "NTA. Sounds like a gaslighting thief to me. No one likes to have money stolen from them, but at least you found out sooner than later. You might have to just cut your losses and be glad it wasn't worse than it was. I had to do that before with a previous bf regarding money he owed to me. Good for you for calling him out, taking financial control, and leaving him.", "NTA.  He stole the money out of your joint account and can't even offer up a token explanation.  I couldn't live with a thief.", "You're money hungry, lol!? He's the one playing hungry hungry hippos with your money. NTA. End of the day, he's still the guy that stole from you. Do you really want to stay together?", "NTA- you need to get this straight.  Your bf is thieving- hopefully doesn\u2019t have some stupid idea that gambling will solve his problems. \n\nI feel for you. This sucks.", "NTA\n\nIts sure as hell justified!   He's spending a very alarming amount of money and refusing to account for where it's going.  That is break up territory.", "NTA. You made the right call here.", "Nta, be harsher. \nThe fact that he\u2019s gaslighting you about it very much means he did something shady", "NTA. A withdrawal from a joint account really isn't stealing as many have found out the hard way. Including myself. \n\nBeing secretive with the money is a serious red flag. Good on you for taking action. Best of luck to you going forward.", "Nta at all. His refusing to tell you where the money went is not okay.", "He stole your money, this is black and white. Get everything in writing (ie giving notice to the landlord). NTA. \n  \n  Bravo for handling it so well though, this guy\u2019s a waste of oxygen.", "NTA - Your boyfriend is a sly thief.  The fact that he took money without saying anything is low.  At least you learned about it early and put an end to it.\n\nCount yourself lucky and you didn't have a lot more in the account, because you probably will never get it back.\n\nBTW - if he venmoed from your account can you dispute the transactions?", "NTA\n\nffr, the second money goes into a joint account, it belongs equally to any & all accountholders.  Any accountholder has the right to withdraw any (or all) funds from the account, and it's not stealing, no matter who the original source of the deposit is. \n\nSomething to keep in mind before you merge funds with anyone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And even if he\u2019s not hiding the expenses, it sounds like he doesn\u2019t trust you with the money, so why should you trust him with YOUR money?

Man's a thief and trying to make you second-guess yourself.

I am the sole worker, so she just contributes to groceries while tending to our house. I have no idea how much money she has (it\u2019s likely reasonably substantial), but we both make sure not to let money be an issue between us by keeping our spending under our own control. \n\nWhen we started dating, I was paycheck to paycheck, but I budget like a champ and she\u2019s so thrifty that we\u2019re in pretty good shape.
