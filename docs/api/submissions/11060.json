They have two kids. I hung out with the kids and took them out to do stuff. They were thrilled with the extra attention. But at home things were not nearly as fun. \n\nI was there several weeks and my uncle was constantly complaining the oldest kid doesn\u2019t like him. Which I mean yeah, she\u2019s 13, kids that age hate everything. But I think it got to my uncle that she was so nice to me. I tried to tell him it\u2019s just because she hasn\u2019t seen me and she\u2019s excited.  But he kept complaining and he was doing it directly in front of his kid. So then there\u2019s a ton of fighting. I tell my uncle can he please stop harping on this while I\u2019m here because I want to enjoy my time with everyone. And it\u2019s hard to do that when he keeps riling up his hormonal daughter. \n\nHe tells me to butt out and let him parent his kid. So I go quiet. But then the final week everything boils over. We\u2019re having a nice dinner; my aunt made traditional meal from our ethnicity. And my cousins are doing sibling things bickering at the table. It really wasn\u2019t that serious, neither kid was upset. I confirmed that with my younger cousin after. So then here comes my uncle who says to older cousin, \u201cYou are nasty as hell. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re so popular when all you do is talk shit.\u201d So OF COURSE now cousin is being fresh, and my uncle keeps responding wanting the last word, and before we know it they\u2019re both screaming. My uncle is following her round the kitchen ranting at her, now she\u2019s saying all sorts of bad things (like \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d.) So he takes her upstairs kicking and screaming. \n\nWhen uncle comes back down we finished our meal and then I followed him into the living room. I asked him if older cousin can still come out with me and the other kids tomorrow. I leave in two days. Uncle says hell no. And, well, I lose it. I tell him he needs to stop trading words with his kid like he\u2019s another middle schooler. That half the reason she acts up is because he is constantly calling her names and tit for tatting with her. He\u2019s a grown-ass man and he knows that his kid is at a hard age and there\u2019s no reason to punish her for things that are completely normal, like rolling her eyes or not wanting to hug him goodnight or tonight: trading words with her sibling at the table. Uncle says I have no idea what it feels like to lose your bond with your kid. I say well that\u2019s on him, because he\u2019s hardly doing a good job of helping her thru her middle years. \n\nAunt says I\u2019m out of line, so does grandma, so does my mother. All my other relatives including granddad and uncle\u2019s OWN BROTHERS say I\u2019m in the clear and he needed to hear it.

Trust me, there is a lot to enjoy about her while you still live with her and see her every day.\"\n\nWhile he may be fully in the wrong and what you said was accurate, it doesn't mean it helps. \n\nHe feels disrespected by his daughter and now by you, too.

The 13 year old girl described here sounds like she is on the autobahn racing towards ruining her life.  Not every angsty teen becomes a delinquent but every delinquent WAS also an angsty teen first.  Like I said, you don't know the thousands of lesser reactions her parents may have already tried to improve the situation.  When there is a younger child living under the same roof, the stakes get even higher.  If the F-bomb is being thrown around left and right that can indicate very bad things for a future family situation, job situation, and even criminal record.

Didn\u2019t step in and didn\u2019t contact authorities to help the kids. You\u2019re just as evil as he is because you see the evil for what it is and you allow it. THE LEAST you can do is tell your relatives, your nieces teachers, and make it so he at least faces some social pressure.

My aunt said you can\u2019t just lay down on the stairs and scream at your dad. My uncle then picked her up princess style and took her to her room. \n\nIt was really crazy that night but that was very out of the ordinary for things to get so bad, I think everyone was exhausted and short tempered because we did a ton of stuff while I was visiting; it was very busy. Cousin doesn\u2019t get that bad usually and uncle would normally have dropped it at some point.

It makes me think of regression which *can* be a sign of abuse, whether physical or emotional/psychological.", "It sounds like the father is reacting in a traditional gender role, and you're right that authoritarian parenting generally doesn't turn out well. It would be generous to reach out. It sounds like he's struggling in life, and may be redirecting it into trying to control a teen... but emotional connection doesn'twork like this. How's his mental health, because this could be a yellow flag?", "Age 13 is just PRIOR to grades slipping, rebellious friends, casual hookups, and weekend partying.  You know that.  Her dad isn't perfect.  No dad is.  But you have no clue how many hundreds of calm and cool strategies he has tried with her.  When it's unchecked at age 13 a terrible attitude can lead to being fired from multiple jobs and having multiple divorces.  Dad wants to protect her from that.  You need to offer a little freaking understanding instead of throwing fuel on the fire."]}
