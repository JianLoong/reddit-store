They have two kids. I hung out with the kids and took them out to do stuff. They were thrilled with the extra attention. But at home things were not nearly as fun. \n\nI was there several weeks and my uncle was constantly complaining the oldest kid doesn\u2019t like him. Which I mean yeah, she\u2019s 13, kids that age hate everything. But I think it got to my uncle that she was so nice to me. I tried to tell him it\u2019s just because she hasn\u2019t seen me and she\u2019s excited.  But he kept complaining and he was doing it directly in front of his kid. So then there\u2019s a ton of fighting. I tell my uncle can he please stop harping on this while I\u2019m here because I want to enjoy my time with everyone. And it\u2019s hard to do that when he keeps riling up his hormonal daughter. \n\nHe tells me to butt out and let him parent his kid. So I go quiet. But then the final week everything boils over. We\u2019re having a nice dinner; my aunt made traditional meal from our ethnicity. And my cousins are doing sibling things bickering at the table. It really wasn\u2019t that serious, neither kid was upset. I confirmed that with my younger cousin after. So then here comes my uncle who says to older cousin, \u201cYou are nasty as hell. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re so popular when all you do is talk shit.\u201d So OF COURSE now cousin is being fresh, and my uncle keeps responding wanting the last word, and before we know it they\u2019re both screaming. My uncle is following her round the kitchen ranting at her, now she\u2019s saying all sorts of bad things (like \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d.) So he takes her upstairs kicking and screaming. \n\nWhen uncle comes back down we finished our meal and then I followed him into the living room. I asked him if older cousin can still come out with me and the other kids tomorrow. I leave in two days. Uncle says hell no. And, well, I lose it. I tell him he needs to stop trading words with his kid like he\u2019s another middle schooler. That half the reason she acts up is because he is constantly calling her names and tit for tatting with her. He\u2019s a grown-ass man and he knows that his kid is at a hard age and there\u2019s no reason to punish her for things that are completely normal, like rolling her eyes or not wanting to hug him goodnight or tonight: trading words with her sibling at the table. Uncle says I have no idea what it feels like to lose your bond with your kid. I say well that\u2019s on him, because he\u2019s hardly doing a good job of helping her thru her middle years. \n\nAunt says I\u2019m out of line, so does grandma, so does my mother. All my other relatives including granddad and uncle\u2019s OWN BROTHERS say I\u2019m in the clear and he needed to hear it.

He sounds physically as well as emotionally abusive and the fact that his wife is okay with it is tragic because the kid has no hope of rescue.  \n\nI\u2019d keep an eye on it and not be shy to call CPS, kids are most often abused at home and when mom and dad are the perpetrators, their only hope in being helped is a teacher or witness who is willing to stick up for them and stick with it.", "NTA.

Let me guess he was the \"cool\" and \"fun\" dad that is now angry that his daughter doesn't think that anymore. He is a horrible father if he thinks insulting your children and physically dragging them places is acceptable to completely normal teenage attitude then he's going to be absolutely shocked when they absolutely hate him when they grow up more. Also expect him to get worse. \n\nNTA, I would even go around telling everybody we both know how he felt the need to argue around fighting with a middle schooler, and when he inevitably lost the argument he decided to push and hurt her.

He sounds like an absolute nightmare. Parenting is hard and I'm sure nobody always makes the right decisions, but a full grown adult basically provoking his teen child into fights is not just a small misstep. No wonder she acts out if that's how he deals with things.", "NTA  I was a \u201chormonal\u201d teenager a long time ago. I kept adoring my Dad. I kept adoring relatives who had respect for me and treated me well. I am not saying this is always the case, but your uncle will keep \u201closing\u201d his daughter.

It sounds like you are nta, but I am concerned that his wife thinks you were in the wrong.  I think the key in these situations is to learn to be diplomatic.  \n\nIf you had instead told him, how much you enjoy your cusin and say something like\n\n \"I know you guys butt heads, but I have really enjoyed hanging out with her, and she really is a great kid.\n\nHe would probably say something that oppens a bit of a conversation\n\nThen you might say something like, \n\n\"She just needs to know she has room and permission to become  herself.  You have done the hard work, she's a good person.  Trust what you have done and who she is and give her a little room.  Trust me, there is a lot to enjoy about her while you still live with her and see her every day.\"\n\nWhile he may be fully in the wrong and what you said was accurate, it doesn't mean it helps. \n\nHe feels disrespected by his daughter and now by you, too.  Unfortunately, that means it might make matters worse.  \n\nTry to make a second lap and smooth things over a bit.

Do I think he's verbally abusive, yes, Should he change his ways, of course, were you the right person to tell him that at 25 years old, absolutely not. I wonder why this isn't a conversation you couldn't have had with one of your aumts or uncles who could have then talked to him?", "YTA - some 13 year old girls are incredibly rebellious to the point they are in danger of bad substance abuse, hanging out with criminals, and having a baby with some deadbeat.  This girl used you to get a rise out of her dad.  The truth is you have absolutely no idea what these parents have struggled with only being at their house a few weeks.  If you think a 13 year old girl telling her dad to \"shut the fuck up\" is in ANY way completely normal then don't ever have a kid.  It's a sign of bad things in her future.

People appreciate it when you reach back out.  In the end, the results may be positive.  Life is hard.  I find parents on a tight budget are very moody.

The 13 year old girl described here sounds like she is on the autobahn racing towards ruining her life.  Not every angsty teen becomes a delinquent but every delinquent WAS also an angsty teen first.  Like I said, you don't know the thousands of lesser reactions her parents may have already tried to improve the situation.  When there is a younger child living under the same roof, the stakes get even higher.  If the F-bomb is being thrown around left and right that can indicate very bad things for a future family situation, job situation, and even criminal record.  This 25 year old houseguest has no clue whether she is likely to \"grow out\" of it but the parents have a more accurate perspective.", "No, they\u2019re actually very well off.

My uncle says so himself, his problem is her general attitude around the house and my argument is that\u2019s just what teens are like. Also maybe I made it seem like she\u2019s constantly disrespectful but she isn\u2019t! just when she\u2019s in a mood or tired. \n\nYou\u2019re probably right it wasn\u2019t my place to lecture him especially at my age but at the same time I\u2019m not talking out of my ass here; I\u2019m a child welfare worker with 20 teens on my caseload! So I\u2019m talking from some kind of experience. I think you get a lot further with these kids when you don\u2019t stoop to their level with your attitude. As the adults we have to keep our cool and model respectful behavior.", "Interesting.  I feel bad for the ones who can barely pay the bills.  I know the dad may not deserve it but one avenue is to convince your cousin to go have a great time with her dad.  Someone has to break the cycle.  They both need it even if they don't act like it."]}
