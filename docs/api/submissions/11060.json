They have two kids. I hung out with the kids and took them out to do stuff. They were thrilled with the extra attention. But at home things were not nearly as fun. \n\nI was there several weeks and my uncle was constantly complaining the oldest kid doesn\u2019t like him. Which I mean yeah, she\u2019s 13, kids that age hate everything. But I think it got to my uncle that she was so nice to me. I tried to tell him it\u2019s just because she hasn\u2019t seen me and she\u2019s excited.  But he kept complaining and he was doing it directly in front of his kid. So then there\u2019s a ton of fighting. I tell my uncle can he please stop harping on this while I\u2019m here because I want to enjoy my time with everyone. And it\u2019s hard to do that when he keeps riling up his hormonal daughter. \n\nHe tells me to butt out and let him parent his kid. So I go quiet. But then the final week everything boils over. We\u2019re having a nice dinner; my aunt made traditional meal from our ethnicity. And my cousins are doing sibling things bickering at the table. It really wasn\u2019t that serious, neither kid was upset. I confirmed that with my younger cousin after. So then here comes my uncle who says to older cousin, \u201cYou are nasty as hell. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re so popular when all you do is talk shit.\u201d So OF COURSE now cousin is being fresh, and my uncle keeps responding wanting the last word, and before we know it they\u2019re both screaming. My uncle is following her round the kitchen ranting at her, now she\u2019s saying all sorts of bad things (like \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d.) So he takes her upstairs kicking and screaming. \n\nWhen uncle comes back down we finished our meal and then I followed him into the living room. I asked him if older cousin can still come out with me and the other kids tomorrow. I leave in two days. Uncle says hell no. And, well, I lose it. I tell him he needs to stop trading words with his kid like he\u2019s another middle schooler. That half the reason she acts up is because he is constantly calling her names and tit for tatting with her. He\u2019s a grown-ass man and he knows that his kid is at a hard age and there\u2019s no reason to punish her for things that are completely normal, like rolling her eyes or not wanting to hug him goodnight or tonight: trading words with her sibling at the table. Uncle says I have no idea what it feels like to lose your bond with your kid. I say well that\u2019s on him, because he\u2019s hardly doing a good job of helping her thru her middle years. \n\nAunt says I\u2019m out of line, so does grandma, so does my mother. All my other relatives including granddad and uncle\u2019s OWN BROTHERS say I\u2019m in the clear and he needed to hear it.

You're definitely spot on that he's just aggrivating the situation by behaving the way he does, me and my dad are much better now but I remember butting heads with him quite a bit and it wouldn't be pretty.

Hopefully, the uncle will take it to heart.", "And he took her upstairs kicking and screaming.  I sincerely hope OP was speaking metaphorically at that point.", "Yeah the fact that he\u2019s taking her being nice to you so personally is weird. You\u2019re the fun cousin, your presence signifies a fun change in the routine. Pretty often kids act up most around their parents because they\u2019re most comfortable with them, or are fixtures of their day-to-day. I was babysitting one time and this toddler absolutely lost it at the *idea* of their mom leaving, and generally acted up in her presence. They apologized ahead of time for him, but as soon as his mom was gone, that kid was chill as could be and just wanted to vibe with *Polar Express*. The parents were baffled when I told them lol. Felt kinda bad about it, really.", "NTA.

I was thinking more along the lines of wrestling her up the stairs."]}
