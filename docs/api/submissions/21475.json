There are definitely layers of privilege with even this one situation.", "Literally already said this in a previous comment. \\*eyeroll\\* I think a lot of people are thinking I put quotes around it and said \"that's a new one\" like I just learned about it.

To be fair though there have been times Canada has been quicker and more aggressive in getting citizens out of situations.

I got my visa declined because I didn't have a \"proof of accommodation\" for the last night because my plane left at 3 am and I didn't book a hotel for that night. Another time I had to sleep at McDonald's bench with mice running around the floor of an empty airport because there were no rooms left at the airport hotel and I couldn't go back outside because my visa was single-entrance. All the stories from me and my friends who didn't get a visa at all, with no explanation given, even though all the formalities were taken care of...\n\nThe stress your sister is going through is real, so offering some help (not financial) is expected from a close person. Something like helping her read through the rules, doing research about the paperwork she should submit, offering to write her a sponsorship letter if she doesn't have a lot of money on her bank account or a well-paying job and you do, or just admitting that her passport is worse than yours for travelling. My guess is what she actually wants is her anxiety validated, and the fee issue was just blurted out because she was stressed.", "As someone with a 'weak' passport, she needs to get over it. \n\nIf you wanna travel abroad, ya gotta deal with these processes.

Or how people here are herded like cattle and moved from room to room and building to building only for most of them to get rejected? \n\nI mean she wouldn't know but her issue is like normal for most of the world. \n\nPeople have to book hotel rooms and spend soooo much money to get a visa.

Does she see it a sign of love?\n\nRight now you are NTA, but that would change if you and mum deliberately lie to her about who ultimately paid the fee.
