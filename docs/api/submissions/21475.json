OP is not responsible for solving global inequality.", "So you hold a Dutch passport, and so can travel freely in the EU, whereas your family are traveling on Thai passports, and so need to jump through all the \"prove you're a genuine tourist\" hoops?", "It feel unfair but it isn\u2019t. It is based on country safety and border control, and it is based on international relations between countries. There isn\u2019t illegal immigration into Thailand.", "Whether it's unfair or not is irrelevant, and in any case debatable at best.\n\nCountries need to protect their borders, I doubt that illegal immigration into Thailand is anywhere as much of an issue as it is for Schengen countries.", "I grew up in Thailand.", "I have taken trips where not everyone was a US citizen,,", "She doesn't _need_ to. But personally I'd feel like a right arsehole if I was in OP's position and didn't help out/chip in for these expenses for a family trip.", "Right, she moved very quickly from \u201cthis paperwork is stressful\u201d to \u201cmoney would make me feel better\u201d. The mom should just go ahead and pay if she\u2019s already willing to.", "I definitely have passport privilege, being South American but having also Italian citizenship.", "It's fine I technically have passport privilege even though I don't have a passport", "Yes. That is how it works.", "Suggesting that exchange may just be to keep the peace.", "Of course it's unfair.\n\nUnless you're a naturalized citizen, your citizenship is entirely a matter of where you were born and/or who you were born to \u2014 two things you did absolutely nothing to earn and had absolutely no control over.\n\nInsofar as there are differences in the value of citizenship in different countries \u2014 and it's undeniable that there are \u2014 those differences are unfair.", "There is but it\u2019s from other SE Asian countries, and probably some westerners overstaying their visas. It\u2019s just that westerners think of \u2018illegal immigration\u2019 as being economically motivated, instead of refugees or holiday makers.", "??? Of course it's unfair! European borders are literally designed to be unfair! It's not as if she's earned her Dutch passport!", "She just looked at the stamps in our passports and waved us through.", "Yes, it's unfair. Of course it is. I work with people from multiple countries. The ones who had to jump through multiple extra, and more expensive, hoops to get here are all from majority non-white countries, despite being at least as qualified and experienced.\n\nDitto travel for holidays.\n\nBorder control is an idea governments use to scare their citizens into going along with divide and rule - even as they simultaneously import an immigrant underclass to do jobs that don't pay well, plus brain-draining doctors and nurses from less well-off countries.", "She just looked at the stamps in our passports and waved us through.", "Sounds like you are a people pleaser and need stronger boundaries.", " I do prefer being overprepared than under though!!!", "I think it varies a lot depending on the country. I'm Australian and going into Europe I get no question, but American border agents seem to believe that America is heaven on earth and that nobody could possible not want to live there.\n\nI have no idea about Canada but Canadians aren't anywhere near as culturally different from Americans as they think.", "Sure but they don't ask for proof, do they?", "If you have the time and energy, and your family are running around stressed trying to get everything in order, then you could ask them if there's any admin you could help them with to alleviate some of the stress.", "Absolutely.\n\nAnd it sometimes happens that traveling with the EU passport gets you in a long line of other Europeans while using the South American would have been _less_ of a hassle. \n\nBut you never know where luck (or lack of there of) will take you so yes, overprepare, people!", "Sometimes they might, it usually depends on length of stay, purpose and your passport.", "They might ask, even if we have correct visa, immigration  still able to refuse us in if they have suspicion, but they never disclose the reason, it's like having invitation, but the guard say meh, you're not proper for this party. Except maybe if you have diplomatic passport.", "They absolutely do if they deem you \"high risk\" for overstaying/ wanting to secretly immigrate. And in OP's case being both from a \"poor\" country and having a family member who is a EU citizen are common red flags. Same as having a gf/bf in that country and coming to visit them as a tourist. \n\nDoes everyone get stopped and asked for more proof? No. But enough people do that it's advised you bring proof. And when it comes to a tourist visa, just getting that visa will require proof.", "You have never heard of anyone carrying papers? \n\nTo get into South Africa I needed my kids' birth certificates (translated and legalized). And proof of vaccination.\n\nTo get into some of the other countries I have travelled to I needed at least proof of travel insurance. And that includes a neighbouring country we go to at least once a year. \n\nDifferent countries have different requirements. Shocking.", "I\u2019m American and my husband is Indian. We just got back to the US and had to wait in the citizen line, which was much, much longer than the visa holders line. They told him to go with me to the citizen line, even though he is not a citizen or permanent resident. He was grumbling the whole time that he\u2019s never had to stand in the citizen line before and now that he is, it isn\u2019t even faster. Of course, they sent him to secondary processing, making me go with him despite stamping me in no problem lol\n\nIt was the reverse in every other country we visited. In India, they made him come with me to the non-citizen line. The non-citizen line was *much* shorter than the citizen line. In UK and Portugal, they made me go with him to the actual human instead of using egates. That obviously took more time than egates.", "We were talking about Schengen countries n covid vaccination was needed for some time but that's not needed anymore", "Yup. And from my country to Schengen you are supposed to provide the things I mentioned. \n\nI know people who have been asked to show all of the above. When we were there we saw people get detained. We got lucky I guess. Doesn't mean nobody has to ever take papers"]}
