It's a great perk of being dual nationality, especially an EU one and travelling within Europe.\n\nIt's not your fault what your nationalities are, what passports you're entitled to or what things are easier for you with said passports.

But I can understand your stepsister's anxiety and stress over applying for a visa to go travelling. Whilst I don't agree with the idea of you contributing to the visa fee, there's nothing stopping you from helping her in other ways to ease her anxiety.\n\nAnd I seriously don't understand why your Mum needs you to apologise to her (have you said something to upset your stepsister?). I also don't get how you giving your stepsister some money and your Mum reimburses you to keep the peace is an ideal solution. Surely your Mum should just give the money to your stepsister.", "NTA\n\n>My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.\n\nThis will keep happening unless you put a stop to it now. Why doesn't your mother cut out the middleman (so to speak) and pay her daughter's visa fee.", "\"Passport privilege\"? That's a new one. NTA. Enjoy at all and I wouldn't do as your mom is suggesting and that just opens the door to future manipulation. Have a great trip!", "NTA\n\n\"My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.\"\n\nSo you're saying you're not the favorite.  :-)\n\nDon't apologize.  You did nothing wrong, and you don't owe her anything.", "NTA At all", "NTA! It\u2019s her visa fee! She\u2019s just acting entitled, don\u2019t apologize, you\u2019re good.", "NTA, how much is this visa, your parents have the same cost, let them pay and no apologies to the brat.", "NTA. It could be good helping them with information about certain things to get the visa, but it's not your fault you have a different passport and she doesn't.\nShe's probably stressed, hence why she said that, but still, you don't need to pay anything for THEIR visa", "NTA. You happen to have another passport than her. That\u2019s not your fault.", "I can understand her frustration but I don't think you're TAH.

Visa nonsense is just part of the crap you have to deal with to travel. In this case, the relevant thing is not that your passport is \"strong\" - it's that it's an EU passport, so you have free movement throughout the EU, and your family doesn't.\n\nThere's no need to be stressed about the process. It's pretty mechanical. There's a lot of scary language associated with visas and immigration offices, along the lines of \"we have infinite power, and you have no recourse if we decide we don't like you\", but in practice, if you show up with the correct documents, it's just a lot of boring waiting.", "NAH.\n\nYou have an unfair upper hand over the rest of your family. You didn\u2019t make conscious choices to have it, but it\u2019s an advantage you will forever carry that your sister doesn\u2019t. Her anger is reasonable, even if you didn\u2019t choose the inequity. If it were me, and I were financially able, I would consider paying more for the tickets or buying them a nice dinner. Use your privilege to help your loved ones.", "That's bs. I have medical needs that others don't. I have food restrictions other don't.

Maybe run an errand for the family while they\u2019re trying to get the paperwork in order? Your comment of just \u201cchilling \u201d is  an AH comment. I don\u2019t think your under any legal obligation to help. But I\u2019m surprised your family wants to travel with you if this is how you act.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume I must have \"passport privilege\" tbh. I guess I should be thrilled as it's one of very few, lol", "26 is plenty old enough to know that \"fair\" doesn't mean \"the same for everyone\". So NTA, as long as you aren't gloating (you do come across smug but perhaps that's a choice of wording). But making an effort to help out if everyone else is stressed would be a nice thing to do.\n\nI *wouldn't* apologise and pay in just to keep the peace. Your mom is asking you to pretend that your sister is in the right, even though nobody actually thinks she is. That's not a great family dynamic.", ">didn't need a visa but was so worried about all the other papers OP mentions. Know how many the agent looked at? Zero.\n\nWhy would you be worried about visa application if you don't need visa? Which agent are you talking about?", "Maybe it\u2019s just your choice of words.

If your itinerary isn't complete like travel between two neighboring cities within same country, then you are rejected on the spot. Or you take an overnight flight without hotel stay, rejected again.\n\nI have never heard anyone carrying papers at immigration gates and nowadays lot of visa free travellers don't even have to face a human and can simply go through with a machine scan of passport"]}
