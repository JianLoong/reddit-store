If mom or step dad give you the money right there, in your hand then I would just pay it out of convenience but I would not pay and wait to be reimbursed.", "Yeah, it should have been discussed and agreed upon initially, which is why I said ESH. But frankly the cost of a visa is probably a fraction of the cost of the whole trip, I doubt it's a matter of affordability but more just recognition that the OP gets to totally avoid a big time-waster and a major source of stress. OP's seeming refusal to acknowledge the big unearned advantage they have is what makes them an asshole. Why travel with your family if you don't want to work together with them?", ">So you are blaming OP for being born with this privilege\n\nNo, I'm blaming them for being unsympathetic about it.\n\n>When will it stop? Next stepsister will find that OP have other privileges that she doesn't have and will want OP to finance those too.\n\nIt stops at: \"We are undertaking a specific activity together and otherwise splitting shared costs, so it's reasonable for necessary costs to be absorbed.\" That's very different from \"you should finance my life\".\n\n>If this is the case, you, I and others not born into wealth should expect those who were born into wealth to give us help with us with our debts too.\n\nYes, as someone who was born into relative wealth and privilege along many axes I am in fact in favor of redistribution of wealth from the very wealthy to the less wealthy.", "Sure. That may be correct, \\*and\\* the step sister is \\*still\\* an entitled asshole. I also have a weak passport. I have been through numerous visa application processes. They are always headaches. I have cancelled trips and changed plans because I cannot move as freely as someone with a stronger passport can. Do I complain about this? Yes. Do I think this is racist and colonialist, also yes. It has never occurred to me to demand that someone with a stronger passport pay my visa fees, because as annoying as this is, and however well I understand colonization, racism, and globalization, I'm not an entitled asshole.", "Isn\u2019t *everyone\u2019s* issue(s) rooted in complex history that is shaped by colonization, racism, and globalization? I mean even vacationing from Thailand to Europe at all is the consequence of globalization\u2026*and* colonization.\n\nSaying that something is rooted in racism or colonization or globalization doesn\u2019t excuse any individual for the way they behave toward or think about other individuals, unless that other individual is literally their oppressor. I have a feeling OP is not step sister\u2019s oppressor.", "I actually think it is a really good analogy. It\u2019s societal issue based on misogyny (racism/colonialism in the OP\u2019s situation) that afabs have every right to complain about. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can demand your brother buy you tampons out of fairness", "AFAB?", "I'd say the exact opposite. Just like we have those taxes because of structural inequality, some nations have far weaker passports. Instead of misogyny, it's colonialism and racism here.", "I'm not saying it's a good idea I'm just saying those are the 2 points of view the mom could be coming from that I can think of. \n\nWhat Mom should be doing is shutting the sister down.", "I agree completely, I just mean those are the possible angles the mom could be viewing it from.\n\nWhat Mom SHOULD do is shut the crap down with the sister.", "Because the point is to keep the peace, which (in her view) means it has to come from OP", "I just don't think she said it to manipulate OP, she's just bitter.

There's also \"expats\" who work black in Thailand because they don't get a working visa. And that's a problem. That's why, in most cases, you need to show you have a way out (plane ticket, bus ticket etc) before entering.\n\nThey are just more willing to not be as strict about their visa (the stamp on entry is still a visa) to make it easier for tourists to come and spend money there (because they do spend a lot, especially Americans and Chinese). \n\nI was on Koh Tao when the military shut probably a quarter of the island down, arrested illegal immigrants (also Europeans under them) to throw them out, and everyone that didn't had a proper licence. You just wouldn't read about any of that in our newspaper.", "Ehh there are lots of Europeans and Americans overstaying their visas in Thailand.", "\"isn't illegal immigration into Thailand\"? Uh, I guarantee you that if you gave me (Westerner) two minutes in any expat/westerner-heavy part of Thailand, I could find you at least one example of a visa overstayer, if not bonafide longterm (i.e. years) illegal immigrant. Your statement is like \"No gays in Japan\" (give me 2m in \u65b0\u5bbf\u4e8c\u4e01\u76ee, etc): both trivially demonstrably false, and both frankly offensive bc they're both obviously trying to duck the issues by pretending they don't exist.", "^ bot", "Are you ok ?

Time to grow up", "No, other people don't absorb costs just because they're going on a trip together. I'm meeting my family later this year for a vacation. It is wildly more expensive for my husband and I to fly there due to a stupid NFL game. I would never even consider asking my family to help me pay the extra amount. It's absurd. I could cry about it not being fair that it's costing us more money than them, but instead I'm being an adult and recognizing life isn't fair and i can't control everything. It would be beyond absurd to even consider asking them to pay more money towards our flights.", "what is the definition of a \"strong\" passport?  like are we talking 1st world vs 3rd world?  or just being from a country other countries view positively like idk Canada", "I think you\u2019re missing the family element here though. This is a *family* trip. If the rest of the family don\u2019t get their visas, nobody gets to go, including OP.

Currently the UAE has the strongest passport.  \n\nhttps://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php", "A strong passport is essentially a passport that doesn't need too many visas to be able to visit other countries. \n\nIf you have a strong passport, you don't really have to worry about visas. You might have to get a visa to a country but it's unlikely you'll be denied or have to fight tooth and nail to obtain said visa. More often than not, you can just hop on a plane and go.\n\nIf you have a weak passport, you need to apply for a visa, and depending on things outside of your control, the likelihood of success varies. You can prepare for months and have everything in order but be denied because you're a single woman in a third world country and they don't want to risk you being a mail order bride. \n\nFirst world countries are more likely to have a strong passport and third world countries are more likely to have a weak passport.", "https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php", "I don't think I'm missing anything here.

Nowhere does it say that she is struggling with affording the cost of the visa fees, or is worried about being refused the visa, she is simply bitter that her sister, who has a more powerful passport, is excused the stress. Is it unfair that people with stronger passports move through borders more freely, I happen to think so. Does that give anyone the right to demand that they cover visa fees when they have not already offered? No, that's entitled behavior. That's taking advantage. Family members are entitled to respect.
