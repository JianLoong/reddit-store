But if that's how she reacted, she might not or might take a while...\n\nTo resolve the toxic energy,  an option might be to approach her and ask if she wants to talk about what happened at the farm. Then hopefully she could be open to a more mature response in a less public place.", "NTA, your kid, you decide. And you have a legitimate concern with his lower immune system. I had a strong immune system, but my sister had a weak one, so she couldn\u2019t do things I could do, and once she came along, I couldn\u2019t do some things that I could do before because I might have carried germs with no symptoms. I accepted that at 3 years old. Your mother should be able to accept that.", "NTA. \n\nOn top of believing that she knows better than you.

Is there something in the water or does becoming a grandparent just rot your brain? It's a fascinating trend I've noticed.", "NTA.\n\nI'd be willing to bet she was one of those parents who said, \"As long as you're in my house, you'll follow my rules,\" but now you're no longer in her house and she still wants you to follow her rules, right?\n\nI had the same sort of issue with boundary-setting with both my mother and MIL. I'm guessing this child is your first? Anyway, it's part of growing up (by which I mean, your mom needs to grow up): learning to respect the fact that her child is now an adult and she has to respect your decisions and your boundaries even if she disagrees. It's good you stood up to her because my mom and MIL both pushed boundaries like that for the first couple of years, and I had to have talks with both of them.", "NTA. She\u2019s being self centered and completely disregarding you as a parent and the health of your kid. Sure, you ran around and put things in your mouth as a kid, but I\u2019m guessing you *didn\u2019t* have a low immune system whereas your kid does. That makes things completely different. Plus, You\u2019re absolutely right that you are the parent. You are the one who decides. \n\nI\u2019m also guessing this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something like this. Just ignore her hysterics.", "Sounds like they live together? Still\u2026 yeah.\n\nNTA OP.
