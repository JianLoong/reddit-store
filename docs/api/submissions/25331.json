I then explained to him that regardless of his efforts, Stacy's parents probably wouldn't change their opinion of him, and Stacy herself would probably move on to someone else as she saw him as a joke.\n\nHe got pretty upset by this and told me that I was weird. I told him that he was becoming a joke amongst his peers and that our parents would be deeply ashamed of this if they knew (they know very little of this entire situation). I said this because, earlier this summer he made up an excuse to miss a family event so that he could hang out with her. And overall, I think our parents would be embarrassed that their son is demeaning himself like this.\n\nI also said that he was simping like an idiot when he should be focusing on getting into a good college.

Yes they are young but this girl is using and abusing your brother and he needs to see this. She\u2019s so disrespectful and degrading and clearly is using him for the attention and gifts. If she says these around him, imagine what she says when he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s to the point where even her friends are feeling confident to insult him. \n\nI\u2019d want to actually check in with my brother and see how he\u2019s doing. Why would he just sit there and let her be so cruel to him? Is it because they have this small little pockets of time together when she\u2019s nice to him? Actions speak louder than words, and I don\u2019t think she values him. And I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s too smitten, or doesn\u2019t think very highly of himself, to see it or do anything about.\n\nFrom a sibling or outside perspective, yeah this is annoying.

You slightly for being more worried about being embarrassed by your brother\u2019s actions than him demeaning himself to try to get a girl who doesn\u2019t like him.\n\nYour brother sucks as well for not taking No for an answer and being overly pushy/obsessive about this girl. This could very well be a precursor to stalker like behaviour and he needs to let go of this situation. Bombarding a girl with gifts until she says yes is not a good thing to teach a high school kid is acceptable. It\u2019s devaluing the autonomy of the girl involved.\n\nObviously the girl and her family suck for the out of his league comments, but have you considered that maybe this girl feels extremely uncomfortable with how your brother is acting. Talk to your parents, talk to your brother. \n\nThe use of the term \u201csimping\u201d is derogatory. People in romantic relationships do nice things for each other, its not a \u201csimp\u201d situation. I doubt if your father bought something for your mother you would call it simping.

No wonder your brother thinks treating him like shit is normal because he\u2019s grown up with you doing it to him.", "YTA.\n\nYes, your brother is being dumb.

It bothers me a lot considering that its my brother acting like this", "I honestly think its ridiculous to compare my parents relationships, to whatever my brother has going. The girl keeps him around for gifts and attentions, he's happy to indulge her", "Eh, a lot of this reads as brother potentially harassing Stacy.... the \"nicer\" view that he's giving her free stuff is over looking that there's a high chance even that is not wanted. There's honestly some red flags going on here\n\nI wouldn't assume her friends had good intent, either- that sounds like a prank, and she may not even be aware they were saying that with the \"hard to get\". Add in she gave him a chance and OP likely got his info on the parents from his brother, who should be considered an unreliable narrarator, and it's kinda alarming.\n\nThe names are escalating because Stacy wants him to leave her alone. That's fairly common high school behavior. It's likely going to get more hostile if brother persists", "Our parents are present and they are aware that he and Stacey hang out.

It\u2019s easy to convince oneself that other people can see our good hearts, when it\u2019s irrelevant if they aren\u2019t interested. You would do better by being a big brother and taking him under your wing, and being kind. Distract him. Study with him. Hang out with him. Work out with him. Listen to him but also let him know that he deserves someone as excited about him as he is about Stacy, and at 17, there is no hurry. Stacey isn\u2019t even his friend.

Standing by it anyhow. \n\nBut you should NOT tell your parents your brother is \"simping\" (btw,i do think you're kinda an AH fit that phrasing and for being \"embarrassed\"instead of \"worried\").\nI do think you should say you think tie brother is being emotionally abused by a girl who belittles him.  Lay out facts to them without commentary.\n\nThis is kinda like the grade school difference between 'tattling' and 'keeping safe'.\n\nIf you think he's being embarrassing and that's your only worry,  STFU because people in love are embarrassing and people are allowed to like things/people you don't like. \nIf you think that someone is systematically insulting and belittling him, destroying self confidence, monitoring and berating him, then tell to keep him safe.", "Yeah what you need to be telling him is that he should stop wasting his time on someone who seems like they're only using him, and that he deserves to be with someone who likes him for him. \n\nThis has nothing to do with Stacy's parents, or what other people think. It's about his own self image.", "Solid take/advice."]}
