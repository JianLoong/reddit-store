This could very well be a precursor to stalker like behaviour and he needs to let go of this situation. Bombarding a girl with gifts until she says yes is not a good thing to teach a high school kid is acceptable. It\u2019s devaluing the autonomy of the girl involved.\n\nObviously the girl and her family suck for the out of his league comments, but have you considered that maybe this girl feels extremely uncomfortable with how your brother is acting.

There's honestly some red flags going on here\n\nI wouldn't assume her friends had good intent, either- that sounds like a prank, and she may not even be aware they were saying that with the \"hard to get\". Add in she gave him a chance and OP likely got his info on the parents from his brother, who should be considered an unreliable narrarator, and it's kinda alarming.\n\nThe names are escalating because Stacy wants him to leave her alone.

You would do better by being a big brother and taking him under your wing, and being kind. Distract him. Study with him. Hang out with him. Work out with him. Listen to him but also let him know that he deserves someone as excited about him as he is about Stacy, and at 17, there is no hurry. Stacey isn\u2019t even his friend.

Lay out facts to them without commentary.\n\nThis is kinda like the grade school difference between 'tattling' and 'keeping safe'.\n\nIf you think he's being embarrassing and that's your only worry,  STFU because people in love are embarrassing and people are allowed to like things/people you don't like. \nIf you think that someone is systematically insulting and belittling him, destroying self confidence, monitoring and berating him, then tell to keep him safe.", "Yeah what you need to be telling him is that he should stop wasting his time on someone who seems like they're only using him, and that he deserves to be with someone who likes him for him. \n\nThis has nothing to do with Stacy's parents, or what other people think. It's about his own self image.", "Solid take/advice.", "You're 1000% correct, and he's letting himself be abused because he thinks it'll get him somewhere he wants to be. \n\nWhen it doesn't, well, that bridge will need crossed before too long. \n\nNTA", "YTA.

And on top of all that you are trying to shove your noggin into the situation by dragging in your parents' opinion (which btw you don't know what it actually is) on it instead of acting like the maturer older brother and trying to have a level-headed conversation. Right now it's much more important to him personally reach the conclusion that this situation is unhealthy; you are only achieving the opposite by insulting him.", "Your brother is in an abusive \"relationship\".  This girl seems to enjoy the feeling of stringing him along as her personal clown.  What he needs is a wakeup call and help extricating himself from her influence (and especially the influence of her friends, who seem to be the primary instigators), not shame."]}
