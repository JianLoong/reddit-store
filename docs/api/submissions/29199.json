Driving 7 hours for a 2-hour event is crazy. \n\nIf there are 25 kids in the party, so birthday boy will not be bored or lonely.\n\nThe only way to come over is if you spend a whole day there, but then they should host you or at least entertain and feed you.", "Info:  Most likely NTA but there's one way I can justify the BIL being upset.  \n\nHave they ever made that trip for one of your special occasions?", "NTA. Send a nice gift and your apologies but it's too far for a one day trip. \n\nNo one gets to lay claim to your time just because it's their kid's birthday, even if it's family. There's nothing wrong with knowing your limits and honoring your boundaries even if others don't agree with you. That's exactly the point of boundaries...so you don't get trampled on and taken for granted.", "NTA, you get to decide what reasonable amounts of time for you to spend in a car are. Yes, you are allowed to base that decision on the function you will be attending. Hopefully you will be sending the nephew a present, but again, that's entirely up to you.", "FaceTime the nibling and send a super cool gift. 7 hours is ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The 7-8 hour round trip isn't worth it, it's not a close family event. Your BIL's son will be too high on sugar, birthday cake and sausage rolls as well as other similarly food fueled kids. He won't miss you unless he's been specifically reminded to. 8 isn't a milestone birthday the way 16, 18 or 21 is either.", "NTA. Gack, who would do that?

My views could be clouded because I'm from the UK whereby 3.5-4 hours would be driving the majority of the country and we aren't as used to long drives compared to large countries such as the US... but, for drives as long as that would generally require an overnight stay in order to rest enough and drive back the following day.\n\nIt's nice that you've been invited and that they want you there, but it isn't a reasonable ask for something so short in duration, and with a large group of attendees, which means you wouldn't get much conversation because the hosts would be floating between guests.\n\nMy general rule of thumb is, that if the journey somewhere takes longer than the duration of the event... then it is perfectly reasonable to give the event a miss. Just be sure to thank them for the invitation, send a thoughtful gift and at the next family gathering be sure to give them a little more one-on-one time and ask to see pictures so they know you do care about their child's party.", "NTA. Because if you are, I\u2019ll be as well seeing as my cousin has 4 kids and they live 3 hours away and I\u2019m not attending 4 birthday a year which requires a 6 hour drive during the day.", "I'm sorry our inability to attend makes you so upset, we will definitely miss the opportunity to see you all. We'd love a video phone call at some point, but if that isn't possible we look forward to seeing party videos! And then respond to nothing else. Definitely NTA and a VERY weird ask tbh", "yta It's your nephew's birthday, a special occasion for a child, and you're not willing to make a reasonable effort to attend. A 3.5 to 4-hour drive might be a bit inconvenient, but it's not an unreasonable distance for family. Your priorities seem skewed if you can't spare a few hours to celebrate with your family on this occasion. Your brother-in-law has every right to be disappointed with your decision.", "NTA.  And you don't even know if your BIL is angry.  Texting is hard to decipher sometimes.  I wouldn't even bring it up again unless they do.", "NTA and anyone who gives you a hard time about this is certainly the asshole in this situation.", "NTA!!! You aren't obligated to go. It was unreasonable of BIL to expect you to show up with such a drive.", "Way too far to drive.", "Nta", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. 7-8 hours in the car with an adult can be unpleasant.  Let alone kids.", "NTA. That's asking too much.", "Nta, I travelled 6.5 hours each way for my niece's 16th, but that was a big occasion. 3.5 each way with kids is far too long for an 8th birthday.", "NTA.  Do you do video visits?  I think your nephew would probably like a short video call afterwards (maybe a different day) where he can tell you about it.  If you're close enough you can still mail him presents.  Really surprised how quickly people seem to have stopped doing video visits after covid.  They're not just for quarantine.", "NTA...just NTA.", "25-30 kids, that's going to be noisy too, so including parents sticking around that's a big event. Two people won't be missed.", "For many years now, my rule of thumb has been that I never drive any long trips unless I will be spending more time at the destination than the round-trip driving takes. It's made so many traveling decisions so ready.", "No. Not once.", "Exactly this. I live thousands of miles away from my mom and she still gets a relationship with her first grandchild because we can FaceTime regularly.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201ckids spell love T. I. M. E.\u201d but you don\u2019t have to be physically present to spend time with someone these days.", "7-8 hours total driving for an 8 y/o's birthday. Yta for thinking that is reasonable. That kid is going to be playing with his friends, not crying because his aunt and uncle didn't come- especially if they send a gift, which he probably won't even look at the card for. And if this couple has kids, it definitely isn't worth it. That much time in a car with children just to go to a birthday party sounds miserable.", "I\u2019m *all about* family, like to a crazy extent\u2026but an 8 hour round trip for a 2 hour party with 30 kids is absolutely preposterous.", "So...personal boundaries don't matter? LOL, okay.", "It\u2019s 7-8 (or possibly more) hours of driving in one day. That\u2019s a lot.", "It\u2019s a completely unreasonable ask to expect 7-8 hours on drive time for a two hour kids party where there will be stacks of other people in attendance.", "How close are you and your spouse to their nephew? How often does he see you two?", "Do you and your husband ever host parties for your kids or just family gatherings in general? If so, are your BIL and his family invited?", "It's not about them or their discomfort. It's about making an effort for family, especially for an 8-year-old's birthday. Kids remember these things, and the joy of having his aunt and uncle at his party would mean a lot to him and his family. Sending a gift is nice, but it's not a substitute for their presence.", "That's the length of a working day stuck in a car, all for two hours to see thirty odd sugar high kids, parents and family with half an eye on where their kids are. Not much chance for one on one time with the birthday boy either.", "We see them 2 - 3 times per year I'd say. I forgot to add that we have small children. They would be happy to see each other, but 7-8 hours in a car WITH small children is hard, and LA traffic feels volatile and dangerous. Having had 3 of my cousins, all on separate occasions throughout the years, die in Los Angeles traffic crashes, it feels that much more contentious.", "We extend an invite to them to kids\u2019 birthdays out of courtesy, but they have never come. Nor would I ever expect them to.", "Wow, you are seriously detached from real life. I'm willing to bet there's a post or 3 about you in this forum. \n\nMost people aren't making a 7-8 hour trip in one day for their Dad's birthday, unless it genuinely may be his last, let alone a niece/nephew/cousin's party. This isn't their own son or daughter- and the post says it's the \"brother in law's son,\" so it sounds like a step nephew. That kid may have only met the couple once or twice. \n\nWho hurt you as a child?", "Are you OP\u2019s BIL? \ud83d\ude02", "The return trip would not be fun if your kids were still on a sugar high.", "Wait, 7 hours in Los Angeles traffic?  I wouldn't do that trip for Moschiach deciding it's a good day to wake everyone up.", "That makes me feel cringy and I'm not even contemplating this", "NTA but I vote you send a nice gift. I live in Ventura county and the drive to LA in bad traffic can be hellish! I know when I enter LA county because the traffic on the 101 freeway becomes stop and go! Why not meet up to spend a day together somewhere between where you both live so it is only a 2 hour drive?  \n\n\n\ud83e\udd23 it is such a California thing to measure how far away something is by the drive time!", "NTA Lol your BIL is an asshole.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you were going for the weekend or something. But to drive that for 2 hours? I wouldn\u2019t do it just with me in the car, let alone with small kids.", "It\u2019s already a tossup to take the drive without kids. If you\u2019ve got babies/toddlers in the mix, it was an unreasonable request", "At 8 years old, best gift wins.... So send an awesome gift, and cross your fingers he remembers it was from you!\n\nWith a butt load of kids coming over, he won't even remember if you were there.... And to your BIL- I mean a completely random person trying to say you are TA,  eff.off!\n\nAs a side note, you said this was your BIL's child, does that mean it's not your sister's child? Not that step children are any less important, but I feel like this is important for context.", "Send a present and your regrets.\n\nExpecting you to travel that far is unrealistic and unfair.", "This is perfect. I agree 100%.", "So true!", "That makes it an easy judgement. He\u2019s not willing to travel but he expects you to? NTA x 100", "Seriously?!?! I feel like it might actually be! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
