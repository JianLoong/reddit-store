He came back in after 20 minutes and said that they are leaving. About 2 days later and we still hadn\u2019t heard from them.

I feel sorry for your brother.", "NTA\n\nShe was snooping through your phone for sure. Idk why though. It's her fault she saw that hilarious contact name and both her and your brother are overreacting.", "NTA \n1. Why did she see what she was saved as in your phone if she was just checking the time?\n2. Losing it like that at a 14yo when you\u2019re an adult is ridiculous \n3. It\u2019s a funny nickname", "Your phone. You can label anyone how you like.\nI'm terrible with names usually.

It's your family too.", "NTA, and if she's had back to back pregnancies, the nickname is accurate. It's also funny as hell. Maybe it's hormones. Maybe she just doesn't have a sense of humor. Who knows. \n\nBut to anyone wanting you to apologize, ask them how she saw your contact list if all she wanted was the time. Every phone I've ever had or seen has the time right on the lock screen and at the top of the regular screens. You don't even need to open the phone. You sure as hell don't need to open any apps! \n\nSo SIL found something by looking at private information without permission, and she's having a hissy fit? Nope, anything you find in those circumstances is your own fault.\n\nAlso, if your phone isn't locked with a password, or better yet, your fingerprint, do it NOW! If you aren't using it, get in the habit of shutting it down so it's locked. If someone makes a grab for it, all you should need to do is hit the power button to lock it.", "NTA I do the same thing! \n\nMy partner is Supreme Asshole, \nMy bestie is Evil One, \nMy sister is ButtCrack Nazi, \nMy nephew is EliTwin, \nMy ex's mom is Bonus Mom\n\nLol", "NTA...if you'd done it anywhere other than your personal phonebook there would be an issue.\n\nSorry not sorry to sil, going through a kids phone and having a temper tantrum at what you find is not acceptable.

She may come around in time.", "Lmao definitely not they are over reacting", "Something's not adding up here. It takes literally two seconds to check the time-all she has to do is tap the screen. So why didn't you ask for the phone back immediately? How did she have enough time to open contacts and swipe through to find hers? And how did she know it was hers? Unless you click on them, contacts don't show the #s associated with them. So she had all that time before you asked for your phone back?

This is a serious overreaction, and their demand that their 14 year old sister/sil stay in a hotel because she made a joke they didn't like is just bizarre.\n\nI'd apologize for making a joke that offended her, and now that you know that pregnancy is a touchy subject for her I'd avoid it (and change her name in your phone) but overall you're definitely not the one out of line here.", "yeah not very nice of you, but you are a teen, I think an apology should do it in this case. She's majorly overreacting, might be the hormonal imbalance contributing, but your brother should know better. + why the hell was she snooping, dying to know that one\n\nINFO did you ever mention this nickname habit to anyone ?", "NTA. Thats not anything offensive and the reaction is pretty extreme.", "NTA and that is a brilliant name for her lol. Tell them you are more mature at 14 than they are as grown adults!!!", "NTA. Thats hilarious btw and nothing to get offended about (fellow always pregnant woman since getting married). I feel like she was just looking for something to be upset about to pull this stunt about not wanting to see you - checking the time takes quick glance at the phone screen & she had to go through your contacts to find that. Good luck to your brother!", "Nta. I would ask her in a group chat with your brother and parents. Id ask her why she was going through your phone. Then I would say ur sprry for the joke but she wasnt intended to see if and you give joking nicknames to everyone in your contacts.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
