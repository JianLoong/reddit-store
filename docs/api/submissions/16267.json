The fact that these celebrations have to be held separately just enforces my thoughts on the situation. When my mother and MIL were both still with us, we had absolutely no problems having a joint Mother's Day lunch with them and everyone enjoyed it greatly.

We would like to take you both out to brunch at XYZ restaurant, please let us know if you can join!\u201d And then DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN!! Do not change the time/place, do not separate the occasions for each mom. Just have one brunch/lunch, in a normal amount of time. If they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t come and it\u2019s their choice to miss out. \n\nBasically don\u2019t tell them what you\u2019re NOT going to do any more, just tell them what you ARE going to do, with very firm boundaries around it, and in a time frame where they can\u2019t argue to move/change your plans. Don\u2019t even tell them about plans that don\u2019t involve them (your nuclear family\u2019s day). Just tell them you are not available that day if they ask."]}
