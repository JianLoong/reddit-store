We weren't able to see each other on Christmas or the New Year, so we ate and caught up yesterday. Derrick and I are really close, and he says I'm like a second mom to him. So yesterday, while we were catching up in the living room, Derrick kept going back and forth on his phone and I could tell he was stressed. I prodded for a bit and Derrick finally decided to talk about it. \n\nDerrick said that he and his girlfriend were arguing because he had apparently asked her to shave down there since he personally thought it was gross. His girlfriend didn't take kindly to that, so they were fighting. Derrick asked me for advice, and I decided to just be honest and tell him that he couldn't force her to change if she didn't want to and that it was up to him to decide how much it was worth it. Derrick said he couldn't believe how nonchalant I was being about it, and he even said that having hair down there is \"gross, unappealing, and that it had a bunch of negative health effects.\" I was honestly getting pretty ticked, so being blunt, I straight-up said \"Honey, I have not shaved my bush in literally decades. Growing up, nobody was doing any of, your mom and I included. It's natural, it's a sign of sexual maturity and womanhood. Quit being a prude unless you want to lose your girl forever.\" \n\nI should mention now that this banter is the way Derrick and I talk to each other on average. But he didn't take it well, saying I grossed him out and accused me of sexualizing myself and his mom. Later, Becky got pretty pissed at me, saying I overstepped boundaries and acted totally inappropriate. Bill thought it was funny, but Ross hasn't said anything to me. Did I go too far though?

Further, talking about grooming, personal hygiene, and bodily choice in the matter aren't inherently \"sexualizing\" of someone, and you clearly weren't in any way meaning for it to be sexual.\n\nIf he didn't want to hear his aunt's opinion, he shouldn't have brought it up to you.", "NTA - He asked for your advice, then body-shamed a sweeping number of women. You answered bluntly and truthfully.\n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s just mad you disagreed with him.

But you know what, his GF is just with the wrong guy.", "NTA! But your nephew is. I think he\u2019s mistaken, he sexualized your body, not you. It may have made him uncomfortable, but he obviously needed a reality check. His girlfriend is likely going to be his ex soon, and good for her! I hope this is a learning moment for him.", "NTA, he's the one who brought up shaving pubic hair not you, and he asked for advice on the matter. if he didn't wanna hear your opinion on shaving pubic hair he shouldn't have asked. \n\nI'm 100% with you on shaving it, it's a recipe for ingrown hair and itchiness. it's perfectly normal, and ime the only downside is that it can get a little gross from discharge or period blood, but if you bathe daily or at least rinse things off it's fine. at *most* a little trimming to keep things tidy is really all that's needed.", "Nta.
