What reason does your husband possibly need to see? His half-siblings treated him abhorrently as a child, as an adult, he made the decision to cut all contact with them. There's nothing left to say here other than she was wrong and whatever vitriol she's receiving from the is deserved. She was told to leave it alone, and yet she continued to press the issue. \n\nThe only AH here is her. You didn't rub her nose it in. You stated the truth. Fuck around and find out. \n\nThis whole mess reminds of a BORU post where the man tracked down the abusive family of his fianc\u00e9e, and much to his surprise was horrified that her reaction was not what he expected. People are allowed to have boundaries, and others need to respect them. Your sister failed to respect your husband's.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband set a clear boundary and she stomped all over it.

However, your sister is.", "Nta. Part of standing up for someone and standing behind them is following their lead. He said no. She went behind his back. She suffers the consequences", "NTA. And to be real cold, however horrible your husband's siblings' behavior was (and... is), it's irrelevant - your husband said \"don't nobody contact them\" and your sister in a wild show of arrogance did, in fact, contact them.\n\nI guess you guys owe her \"gratitude\" alright, and you should be ever so grateful for her actions... by staying the fuck away from her. She has shown how she will act in a way to benefit *her* and her worldview and to hell with everyone else - what, does she think she's fooling anyone? She did it to stir shit and, if things miraculously went down like a saccharine movie, there would be a heartfelt reunion and *she* would be the mastermind. As is, she's the mastermind of a realistic response.\n\nHope the boyfriend is taking notes, he would be a right fool not to.", "NTA - what is wrong with her!?  Yeah, she's 100% in the wrong, and had NO right to get involved in your husband's life that way, at all... You doing it would ALMOST be forgiveable (almost), as the wife.. But your sister? NO... not even a little.", "Your husband had rough life and his older had siblings want nothing to do with him.\n\nHe gave you and sister EXPLICIT boundaries that no one was ever to contact the older half siblings.\n\nYou sister did not respect your husbands boundaries.

It\u2019s like they don\u2019t know how to be at peace and enjoy the conflict.", "NTA\n\nShe went against your husband\u2019s wishes in a matter that was not her place to interfere.
