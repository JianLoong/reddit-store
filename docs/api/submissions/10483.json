If that means paying you back in installments, so be it.", "being devastated doesn't give an excuse to behave that way. He could have just stayed sober and grieved but no.

NTA.", "NTA he can afford to drink, he can afford to make weekly payments to you until you can buy a new pair", "NTA but you ain't getting those earphone back unless you take him to small claims... Also your friends sound like idiots not even trying to see your point. Those earphones meant something thing to you don't drop it you should insist or sue.", "NTA.  He is at fault for breaking them, so he should replace them.\n\nYour friends need to work on their logic skills. Saying he's not at fault for this is like (albeit much less consequential) saying drunk drivers aren't at fault because they are drunk.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d may be going through a rough time and sounds like he could use some therapy, but that doesn\u2019t excuse us from consequences of our actions. He chose to be drunk, he chose to kick a chair, he chose to handle his grief with unhealthy coping mechanisms. Your other \u201cfriends\u201d taking his side because they feel sorry for him is doing him zero favors. They are enabling him to continue unhealthy grieving mechanisms which will just allow him to continue a downward spiral. He may never replace them which is unfortunate, but it may be time for you to look at alternative living arrangements.", "NTA he\u2019s a grown man that takes out his anger on objects that don\u2019t even belong to him, he is responsible no matter what he\u2019s going through.

He chose to get shitfaced drunk and can\u2019t use being drunk as an excuse.", "NTA.\n\nFirst off, drunk or not, your friend broke them. Both sober friend and drunk friend are the same person. Trying to skimp anything with the \"I was drunk\" is sleazy. It's the people who say \"I only cheated because you were away for the weekend\"-kind.\n\nSecondly, he _knows_ he breaks stuff when he gets drunk, so maybe he shouldn't get drunk if he can't afford to replace whatever he breaks.\n\nWhich brings us to number three; if he has money to drink, he has money to put towards your headphones. The next dozen bottles he's drinking could've been your new headphones, but your \"friend\" prioritized getting drunk and wrecking more stuff he can't afford to break.\n\nNumber four: Well, at least we won't have to guess why his girlfriend dumped her violently drunk and constantly broke boyfriend.\n\nNumber five: His grandma died. That sucks, especially if you were close. But at age 21, stuff like that is to be expected to happen. I lost my last living grandparent when I was 24. Such is life. Was I sad? Yes. But devastated to the point that I needed to get drunk? No. Using alcohol as a coping mechanism is a good way to end as an addict by the way.\n\nSo OP; your friend (and roommates) are all assholes. But you are NTA.", "Take him to small claims court. Being drunk isn't an excuse, especially when it's a frequent occurrence. He's not being rude or neglecting his chores, he's damaging other people's property. \n\nNTA", "nta. love how your 'friends' are blaming the victim. Where else are you NOT supposed to put headphones? lol\n\nHe's responsible. Maybe have a payment plan.", "NTA - he broke them and he should replace the value at least. He can pay you back on a payment plan if he has too.", "Take no responsibility for whatever actions, regardless of the consequences. They can now no longer complain. NTA. Your roommates' line of reasoning is extremely ridiculous, as placing headphones on a table is a very normal thing to do - exempting yourself from responsibility because of a crap situation combined with intoxication, is not.", "NTA - His failure to control himself when drunk and the actions that result from that are his problem and he needs to take accountability. Clearly this is his fault and needs to pay.", "What do friends mean it's not hi fault they broke? To me it seems like it's precisely his fault, the chair didn't just fly on top of your headset all by itself. NTA, demand a replacement. He's an adult, he should manage his behavior better. If he can't afford replacing objects he breaks, he shouldn't drink himself into oblivion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbf if I were your mom and saw you not using the headphones I'd ask what's wrong and maybe you don't like it. And if you told me you got them broken by a friend and just let it go, I'd be very very upset, as if you didn't care at all.", "What a sucky situation for everyone. If your mom bought it on a credit card, since it was purchased so recently maybe it's covered by credit card protection. Alternatively maybe because it was such an unusual large purchase for her maybe she purchased the extended warranty at the time of purchase? I guess check those things first if you want to be nice to your friend. But if not he should replace it. If he's graduating from college will he start making money soon?  NTA", "NTA his hard time has nothing to do with your property.\n\nTell him that you get they are expensive but he needs to replace them but you are willing to go with a payment plan. Ask for \u00a35-10 a week/month (whatever he can swing) until you've reached the 200.", "NTA\n\n>I shouldn\u2019t have left them on the table\n\nSo bringing anything into your home makes it liable to damage from your roommate and you just have to accept that? No, nu-uh, that's not how it works. If you'd dropped the headphones on the floor in a spot that people walk through, maybe, but a table should be safe from anyone but toddlers and dogs.", "NTA - Your friend has a drinking problem, and he needs to replace what he broke. If he remembers it or not.", "NTA and even if he can't afford to cough up the whole 200 now, the decent thing to do would be to pay it in installments. If he has to go without booze sometimes to pay it, that wouldn't be a bad thing.", "NTA and your roommate needs to get help for his drinking and emotional problems. Many people downplay this type of violence because it\u2019s against \u201cthings not people\u201d, but it\u2019s alarming, intimidating and damaging behaviour, and absolutely should not be tolerated. I would sit down with him and some or all of the other housemates and tell him if there are any more incidents of kicking chairs etc, drunk or not, he will have to leave. And that he should get counselling (presumably available at low cost or free from the university).\n\nAs for your headphones, yes, he should pay to replace them. If it\u2019s too much for him to pay all at once, if you\u2019re feeling generous, you could let him pay it off, maybe $50 a week for four weeks or something.\n\nAnd tell your friends to back off. Whatever his deal is, this guy\u2019s behaviour is not ok and people around him need to stop enabling him.", "NTA\n\nThere's really not any excuse, even being dumped and having family deaths, that makes it reasonable to violently throw shit around and break stuff. \n\nHe should pay you back.", "NTA.\n\nBeing drunk doesn't mean you get a free pass to be an ass. Don't think we need to ask why his gf left him... If he can afford alcohol he can afford a payment plan of some sort. Grief sucks but it's not an excuse to hurt ppl. And your \"friend\" saying you \"shouldn't have\" left them on the table is a red flag gaslighting technique .. he just told you, the victim, it was your own fault. Find new friends.", "Gosh it\u2019s almost like there should be consequences to actions. Maybe next time he overdrinks and wants to kick over a chair, he\u2019ll remember having to pay $200 for headphone replacements. \n\nHe can stop drinking for a bit to get the money. NTA and anyone saying you are should be willing to cough up the money since poor violent drunkard is having such a rough time right now.", "NTA You need to approach it sensitively because of his situation but it doesn't mean he's not responsible for his actions", "NTA - your friend needs to reimburse you for the headphones. You didn't leave them somewhere they would naturally get damaged. Every person you talk to regularly can be going through a rough time, it doesn't excuse damaged items and bad behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
