But I guess just asking you to do what she wants is easier. They're the a-hole of the story, to you, to your brother, and to their foster kid!", "NTA. This is a parenting issue. You have done the best you can to include her. The very fact your adopted brother is behaving this way without your parents curbing such immature behavior is on them.", "NTA - but you can make more of an effort to get to know her instead of just writing her off as the sibling you'll never connect with. She's used to rejection, so she probably reads more into your actions than you realize. Be easy with her. She deserves acceptance and love, the same as your brother. You're old enough to get this (not a dig at your age. Just saying I'm only mentioning it because of your age ...I wouldn't lay that heavy stuff on a child). Sometimes our actions mean something innocent to us ...and to others, they see it as an indication that they are unlovable.", " NTA.

This girl is a new person and someone you have to get to know.", "NAH, I don\u2019t think you need to go out of your way to become as close to the newer kid like your brother, but I can kind of see where the parents and your newly adopted sister are coming from, and how often you are giving your brother gifts might be a factor here. Another factor could be that maybe she wants a relationship with you too, which it sounds like she might according to your parents. \n\nI think a compromise can be discussed with the family so she does not feel hurt.", "NTA. Title was a bit misleading, but you could try contacting her a bit more if you haven\u2019t already.", "NTA.", "INFO are you showering your brother with gifts or is just for special occasions plus one or two. You are N T A either way but this can make a real difference in parenting difficulty.", "NTA because it was not your intention to hurt her - but put yourself in her shoes, i bet you can imagine how she's feeling a bit unaccepted by you. From the fact that she is in foster care, we can only imagine what hurts and insecurities she is carrying.\n\n   You do not yet have much of a relationship with this young girl, however, you can (and should) change this! Call or email to apologise, say you havent had chance to get to know her very well and that you would like to fix that. Then text her regularly like your bro and send gifts for both at the same time - by texting, you can find out what your sister is in to. Good luck!\n\nEdit: the apology would be for not realising that the FS was so upset and felt excluded...NOT an apology for giving presents. It would be a small act of kindness to recognise her feelings in this way", "I'll go with NTA, but I think you could do better as role model for little bro. Sure, you don't owe the girl anything, but she's part of the family now, and you know she came from a rough spot, and you know now that she's feeling left out. The kindest thing to do would be to send her something when you send you brother something (unless it's little bro's birthday). Maybe get little bro involved in picking something for her and giving it to her. Be a good role model and teach him to be more proud of giving a great gift than receiving one. If you start to treat her like part of the family, there's a solid chance your bro will too. Better outcomes for everyone could be possible. Maybe foster sister is cool and you just don't know yet.", "NAH. I get your parents pov because they are trying to create a home for a child and provide a family and you are part of that family.

As a parent, I see how this is actually really damaging to your FS. I dont think the young people here understand that. \n\nIt isnt about how close you are. Its that she has undergone a lot if pain and wants to feel like she belongs. She isnt asking for presents, the real truth behind this is she is asking to be treat as a member of your family too. She wants to be loved by you too.\n\nYou arent. You need to make the effort to get close to her and get to know her. Even sending tiktoks or memes can count as connection. Stickers and such. It doesnt matter your age, you are integrating FS into the family and yes, this is ostracizing her. Shes already veen through a lot and needs to feel at home somewhere safe and loving.", "Soft YTA. Your parents are trying their best to treat these two tteenagers as equal siblings, but the 15yo brother is flaunting his relationship with you in the face of the other teen. You have to think about how this affects their household. Your parents aren't demanding gifts for the girl. They aren't demanding feelings. They are just saying that if you get something for him just because, think of her too. You can call, text, and communicate with your brother as you always have, but be careful with gifts. Especially since he's bragging about them. If he wasn't doing that, it wouldn't even be an issue.", "NTA - the assholes are your parents. They aren\u2019t parenting either teen.\n\nThey need to tell their foster placement of 3 years that obviously, their son is going to get presents from his sibling he\u2019s known for 13 years, and she should not take that personally. You are NOT *her* sibling. Even if they decided to adopt her, she\u2019s old enough to understand that you don\u2019t know her. You buying presents for your brother is nothing to do with her status, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t know her personally.\n\nThey need to tell their son not to brag about presents from his sibling, to someone who is from a really vulnerable situation who doesn\u2019t have any such family. This would be true if the girl was a total stranger. It\u2019s basic empathy.\n\nIt sounds like they have put their own feelings before their children at every point. When both you and your brother reached teenage years, they got themselves a new child to play with. It\u2019s not right to bring in fosters if this will have an adverse effect on children who already live in the household, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing: saying he can\u2019t have a sibling relationship unless you spend money on the foster child they\u2019ve taken in for their own ego.", "NTA - for now. \nYou love your brother more because you actually know him and spent years bonding with him, you are not wrong for that. They can\u2019t force you to bond to her especially now you\u2019re an adult, presumably not living with them.\nHowever are you doing more with her then just sending her gift cards and such at birthdays and holidays? And are you giving him more gifts outside of gift giving holidays? Because that is just common older sibling courtesy, to make sure younger siblings are being treated equally in gifts, especially when you favour one more emotionally. If that\u2019s not the case, perhaps what they mean is maybe they feel you aren\u2019t making enough effort to connect more personally. \nThere just a lack of INFO to judge accurately. For starters, Idk why they would be using the words discrimination and bullying. Is she a different race? Maybe she came from a hard family, and they are hyper sensitive to your lack of emotional support. Idk", "NTA you lived with one child and have had a relationship with him for 13 years. He's also legally your brother. \n\nYou don't have any relationship with the fostered daughter, who as she's in her late teens may or may not be around for long. If relatively short term fostering is what your parents intend to do from now on, they can't expect you to be big sister to each one.\n\nThey've said if you can't do that to cut back on what you do for your brother. It's not fair to your brother to have him miss out on contact with you etc because your parents have decided to open their home further, and it may cause him to resent her aswell.", "NTA. I get where your parents are coming from and trying to achieve but they've done it maybe the worst way", "NAH, of course you don't *have to*, but I think it would be nice of you to spend some time with your foster sister to bond with her and get to know her. It's been almost three years. Of course you will not be as close with her as you are with your brother, but you can still try.", "I would actually think a bit of both. \n\nNAH", "Taking him out on a treat would probs make the foster sister feel just as bad - because OP would still just be giving attention to one of them", "Why does she need to apologize? She doesn't know the girl and she doesn't owe her a relationship.", "Definitely the way to do it", "OP is not a parent though.", "I am way past being a young person. \n\nOP doesn't owe this girl a familial relationship, to be \"loved by her,\" phone calls, or expensive gifts.

You cannot FORCE a sisterly relationship.", "OP is 29. Her parents have made a recent decision to foster someone in their late teens, knowing they may not stay after they're not required to. Parents might choose to do this regularly going forward aswell. Is OP expected to be a perpetual big sis to an increasing number of kids the whole time? \n\nOP had no say in this decision and should not be expected to treat her as she treats her actual legal brother who she's had a 13 year relationship with.\n\nThis is on the parents for not treating the situation tactfully enough. It's on them to manage FS' expectations regarding relationships with the rest of their family, and to ask their son not to flaunt what he gets so much since he's 15 and it can't be excused as a small child's excitement.", "Sometimes I don't know what is wrong with the people in this sub. \"OP doesn't owe her anything\" - what kind of bs is that? It's like nobody has any empathy.\n\nIt doesn't take much effort to be kind or to send a few messages here and there. But it might mean a lot to OP's Foster sister.", "So parents failed at parenting but OP is somehow the AH?", "I don't think asking the world to revolve around our kids is reasonable. People would have different feelings towards them, different behaviors, and they have to learn which one they want to work to make evolve and which one they can't/don't care. It's parenting. OP is not responsible for that.", "No, she doesnt owe her a relationship. It's just a nice thing to apologise when you hurt someone, even if it WAS unintentional.", "I mean nobody owes anybody anything, but this is a girl who recently joined the family from foster care... The kind thing to do would be to make her feel welcome and part of the family. OP is doing the right thing by giving her gifts but it wouldn't take much effort to reach out to her every once in a while and get to know her. It would probably mean a lot to her.\n\nJust because you're not obligated to be nice, it doesn't mean you should be a dick.", "Not a \u2018young person\u2019 either, and the idea of OP somehow having a responsibility because their parents took on an extra child - let alone when OP is 29 years old, a grown adult with her own life, and long since out of the house - is just silly. A relationship might grow at some point. Pushing won\u2019t help.", "This. Def nta. And I'm middle aged, have kids too. Not some young person. \n\nHe's nta.

He knows the brother because for the last 15 years they got to bond and know each other. Can't and shouldn't force a relationship", "That's right. I said what I said. No one owes anyone else gifts, messages, their time, or a familial relationship.\n\nIf you're so concerned then get a hold of OP and start giving your time and money to this foster kid.", "Of course. Parenting fails are always someone else's fault", "She still doesn\u2019t owe someone she barely knows an apology for giving gifts to her own brother.", "She didn't do anything to hurt her. This kid's feelings are not her responsibility.", "OP isn't being a dick, though. And she certainly isn't being a dick by not having a relationship with this kid. No one is owed a relationship from any woman, not even an older teen girl.", "Bingo.", "OP isn't being a dick yet, but this whole idea of \"I don't owe anyone anything\" is such poison. This girl is part of the family, and existing in a family or a friendship group or any other community is a social contract where you give and you take.

People don't owe me shit, either. Well done.\n\nYou're learning. Maybe eventually, you'll realize bonding and familial relationships can not be forced.\n\nAnd I'm frankly laughing at the downvotes. You're going to have a world of trouble if you think you can force someone to bond with another person. Frankly, it's creepy AF.", "NTA - nope - totally understandable what you are doing. For them to expect you to treat two people exactly the same when you have different relationships with each, is absurd.", "One is your brother, one you've had a bond with for almost his whole life.\n\nThe other is your parents' foster child, one that you practically don't even know.  I'm willing to bet you haven't even met this girl more than a handful of times.  Not your fault, not her fault, that's just how it is.\n\nBig difference.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - sometimes you're closer to one sibling than others - adopted or otherwise.  I'm much closer to my sister and little brother than my older brother.", "NTA, as long as you are kind to her in person, there is really nothing you can be forced to change or do about this non-relationship. I'm sure she has been through a lot, and seeing your brother's happiness has made her jealous. Your parents brought her in to their home. It is their responsibility to show her love and care, not a stranger she doesn't even know.", "NTA.\nYou are giving her gifts though, albeit maybe they're a little bit impersonal but you don't really *know* this person well enough to get her personal gifts.\n\nThat being said, do you have anything *against* getting to know her? I know that she's joining your family as a teen as opposed to a baby like your brother did but even if you're unable to forge a sibling relationship with this person due to that, there's no reason -at least written here- why you couldn't forge your own type of relationship with her if that's an option for you that you want to take.\n\nYou're definitely not bullying her, though. Your parents are somewhat out of line for telling you you are when, realistically speaking, you're giving gifts in line with your attachment.\nIt definitely isn't going to help matters having them attempt to shame you into it.", "Nta. You don't know her and didn't grow up with her. \n\nYour parents could go and foster and adopt 10 more kids but doeant mean you have to treat them all the same.", "NTA\n\nYour parents, and she, need a bit of a reality check. \n\nYou can't just declare closeness. You've had many years with your brother. Your parents should have consulted or considered that adopting such an old child when you were already out of the house would never result in a close bond.", "You're not discriminating against siblings.  You're treating a friend better than a stranger.  I can't fault your parents for being concerned about the discrepancy, though.  The only AH here is your brother, who is throwing your relationship in your sister's face.", "NTA.  You don't know her well so why would you get her a lot?  If you'd known her as long then yeah, AH but not in this case.  Now if you refuse to get to know her better that may be a different story.  She also needs to be making the effort to get to know you.", "NTA", "NTA and your parents' requests are ridiculous. That being said, if my math is right your brother is 15 now. That's old enough to understand that his step-sister is hurting and not flaunt his gifts from you.", "NTA - I would stop sending gifts. Not to be petty, but to let things cool down. Text your brother and say that you still love him but you don\u2019t want to make waves.", "I call bullshit on this. \n\nThe relationships **MUST** be different with a brother that you have bonded with for over 13 years, and a stranger that you don't know.\n\nAnd your parents do not understand this!!!", "NTA.  Sounds like OP parents are trying to force a relationship on her.  Considering the timing, this really isn't fair to OP.", "NAH", "She's a stranger to you basically lol. I get what your parents are saying but if that's how they feel they should be the ones buying her something not you.", "So it sounds like you don\u2019t live anywhere close to your parents. They have unrealistic expectations. Is the foster daughter hurt, I\u2019m sure. Is it your fault, I don\u2019t believe so. You cannot expect a relationship that has been growing over 13 years to be the same or have the same benefits as a relationship that literally does not exist. \n\nAlso why do you have to call her, is she not capable of reaching out to you? If she wants that relationship she has to put in the effort to build it as well. \n\nTell your parents that in trying to make her feel better they are alienating you and their son and causing irreparable damage to their relationships with the both of you. Instead they should be reaching out to the resources provided to help her understand and better settle into the family. Demanding equal treatment between a sibling and someone a half-step above a stranger is bad parenting and a recipe for fractured relationships for all involved. \n\nAlso not to come off as an AH but even in the best of circumstances there is a very real distinction between adoption and fostering. While she has been placed for a good amount of time that can literally change at any moment if she\u2019s not adopted. Or has she aged out? It\u2019s hard to tell because you said she was a late teen when she was placed and it\u2019s been about 3 years. \n\nNTA", "NAH - if the new sister wants actual presents instead of gift cards or vouchers then your parents need to help you out with picking them out. You don\u2019t know her since you never spent time with her - that\u2019s fair. However, since she is family now it would make sense for you to attempt to get to know her. Perhaps ask your parents for some conversation starters/commonalities. You can\u2019t be expected to treat them equally without equal knowledge of them.", "Nta", "This is a tough one.

For the gift giving, ask your parents to make a wish list you can purchase from. It will make her feel more included with minimal effort on your part. For quality time, make sure you are asking to talk to her when you call the whole family and seem excited when you do talk to her.
