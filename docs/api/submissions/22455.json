We'll call this friend Liam.\n\nLiam was a graduating senior from my school, being two grades above me, we met through a mutual friend and got along great, considering we texted a lot and hung out at lunch. Now, after Liam graduated in early March and moved an hour away, we kept in touch and he would occasionally come back to our school to visit me and his younger brother in the grade below mine. \n\nI noticed more weird behaviors in Liam when he moved away. He kept asking me to call him every night, would text me in classes and lash out when I didn't respond, even when I was asleep. He started saying weird things and complimented me often, which I just laughed off, and asked me questions about relationships and if I trusted him enough to say 'I love you'.\n\nNow, cut to the graduation ceremony, late at night, after my family and I took pictures with my older brother (senior). I found Liam and his parents, all normal, and he gave me little plastic flowers that the school gives to the students. It's to show gratitude to someone who impacted your life that year, and he gave them to me. Liam also later claimed he wanted to KISS ME at the graduation, which I was severely uncomfortable thinking about.\n\nAfter that, on a call one night, Liam said he wanted to visit me. He knew where I worked from previous conversations and said he might stop by. (I work in a church with daycare centers for Newborn-5th graders who can't sit in adult service, hence the security needed.) I thought Liam was joking, saying he didn't need to come to my work.\n\nLong story short, HE CAME. Liam arrived at 8 AM (my shift started at 11), asked security for me multiple times, alerted my manager and MOM about it, and didn't leave my city until 12 PM. My mom talked about how it was 'inappropriate' to drive all the way to see her daughter and talked to me later about how all this looked.\n\nI blocked him on Snapchat, and Liam reached out to me on MESSAGES and asked why I blocked him. I explained everything, he was mad and I blocked his number without hesitation.\n\nI'm still contemplating whether Liam deserved it or not...

Are you guys dating? Is there anything here that is missing stating you guys are in a relationship?  You need to let your parent/ trusted adult know that he is making you uncomfortable.

Three years isn't a big deal if you're, say, 25.  It is an extreme concern when you are 15 and \"underage\".  His behavior borders on stalking, so you've done the right thing at this point.", "you need to screenshot all of these messages and notify police this is genuinely unhinged behavior. you\u2019re NTA but GENUINELY i feel like this isn\u2019t over and you need to get a protective order or restraining order.", "NTA.
