We'll call this friend Liam.\n\nLiam was a graduating senior from my school, being two grades above me, we met through a mutual friend and got along great, considering we texted a lot and hung out at lunch. Now, after Liam graduated in early March and moved an hour away, we kept in touch and he would occasionally come back to our school to visit me and his younger brother in the grade below mine. \n\nI noticed more weird behaviors in Liam when he moved away. He kept asking me to call him every night, would text me in classes and lash out when I didn't respond, even when I was asleep. He started saying weird things and complimented me often, which I just laughed off, and asked me questions about relationships and if I trusted him enough to say 'I love you'.\n\nNow, cut to the graduation ceremony, late at night, after my family and I took pictures with my older brother (senior). I found Liam and his parents, all normal, and he gave me little plastic flowers that the school gives to the students. It's to show gratitude to someone who impacted your life that year, and he gave them to me. Liam also later claimed he wanted to KISS ME at the graduation, which I was severely uncomfortable thinking about.\n\nAfter that, on a call one night, Liam said he wanted to visit me. He knew where I worked from previous conversations and said he might stop by. (I work in a church with daycare centers for Newborn-5th graders who can't sit in adult service, hence the security needed.) I thought Liam was joking, saying he didn't need to come to my work.\n\nLong story short, HE CAME. Liam arrived at 8 AM (my shift started at 11), asked security for me multiple times, alerted my manager and MOM about it, and didn't leave my city until 12 PM. My mom talked about how it was 'inappropriate' to drive all the way to see her daughter and talked to me later about how all this looked.\n\nI blocked him on Snapchat, and Liam reached out to me on MESSAGES and asked why I blocked him. I explained everything, he was mad and I blocked his number without hesitation.\n\nI'm still contemplating whether Liam deserved it or not...

Are you guys dating? Is there anything here that is missing stating you guys are in a relationship?  You need to let your parent/ trusted adult know that he is making you uncomfortable.

Three years isn't a big deal if you're, say, 25.  It is an extreme concern when you are 15 and \"underage\".  His behavior borders on stalking, so you've done the right thing at this point.", "you need to screenshot all of these messages and notify police this is genuinely unhinged behavior. you\u2019re NTA but GENUINELY i feel like this isn\u2019t over and you need to get a protective order or restraining order.", "NTA.

You don't want anything to do with him.  I'd consider shaking up your schedule a bit, he sounds like he may not take no as an answer.  \n\nNTA", "NTA you are a child being stalked by an adult. That's creepy. You need to call the police on him. If he's being this aggressive now, what's stopping him from forcing himself on you. Get the police involved and block him on everything", "NTA. Red flags everywhere. Get out now.", "NTA get your mum to speak to his parents and tell them how inappropriate him doing all this to an underage child.", "We never dated. My mom knows of the situation and actually berated him at the church. While she did blame me a bit for my choice of friends, we talked it out and she understands and helped me see that I needed to block him.", "Perfect,  block him and don't engage. He will continue to try to contact you with different numbers and maybe just showing up again. He may blame you for leading him on, playing with his feelings, making you feel bad. Don't feel bad, hopefully he gets the picture and moves on.", "Also, like another redditer said if it escalates, get the police involve, you may need a restraining order. Keep messages and document.", "Alert the school authorities too- because he has a brother in your school, and he may use that pretext to stalk & harrass you further. \n\nHis behavior is alarming even if you were an adult- but the fact that you're underage just takes it to another level of yikes.\n\nYou're very young- if ANYBODY- no matter who they are- makes you uncomfortable and tries pushing you to do anything- report them and immediately block them. You don't owe them anything.\n\nNTA.", "Ew Liam. No", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou told him \"I love you\"! You pretended to be his gf.

Alert your parents please.", "NTA it's cool for a sophomore and senior to be friends but he's taking it beyond friendships or even a healthy romantic relationship. He didn't listen to you or respect your boundaries. Showing up at your job is so not okay that it's not even funny. He deserves to be blocked.", "This is REALLY CREEPY behaviour. Stay away from him and his family!!! Stay safe OP.", "YTA He has a crush on you. You don't have to block him. Just tell him you're not ready for a relationship or don't see him that way.", "Oh mighty All-Father, he is a creep, and girl, run, run, run. NTA for all you did, and please make sure no one gives info about you to this creep. I made a mistake when I was a teenager for being naive and too trusting, but my mother protected me, just like your mother. Run away from this creep, I sensed that he has a strong stalker potential. It might have not been fully manifested, but protect yourself as soon as possible. Ask yourself if what Liam did was okay for you, imagine that he would continue to push it, maybe at some point, he would force himself on you, like kissing you without your consent, or manipulating you into thinking that you should be with him because I think he is going there. He already hinted strongly that he wanted you to say ILY to him, and to kiss him. He was planting the idea and hoping that you would do it if he tried hard enough. Run, girl. Always trust your guts.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSounds like you definitely would've ended up as a lampshade.", "Liam is going to treat some major red flags there. Rather strange and very possessive.", "If he gets worse this could get dangerous.", "I'd consider shaking up your schedule a bit", "NTA get your mum to speak to his parents and tell them how inappropriate him doing all this to an underage child.", "NTA -you\u2019re dodging a bullet. That\u2019s incredibly controlling behaviour that he is exhibiting.", "Get the police involved and block him on everything", "Also some people who aren't emotionally constipated tell their friends they love them all the time, me and my friends do.

He showed up at her work, convinced her to get in his car to talk, drove her out to the marshes, and slit her throat. You should 1000% file a police report and look into a protective order. This obsession isn't your responsibility to resolve in a polite manner, you need to protect yourself first and foremost. Again, **please speak to the police with your parents**\n\nDon't wind up a statistic OP", "Yeah. but when some of your friends you tell you love visits you (after announcing it!)  ---> Do you ghost and block them then?", "I hate that this is 100% correct.\n\nSeriously OP - FILE A POLICE REPORT as soon as possible. And it would be a good idea to install a location tracker on your phone as well as carrying an Air Tag on your person at all times. \n\nI'm not saying this to scare you. I'm saying it because you need to keep yourself safe.", "There is a chance if:\n\na. They knew I was working.  *(showing up at someone's place of work is inappropriate,* ***especially if they work with children.****)*  \nb. They didn't ask, they just announced.  \nc. They came after being told not to come.  \nd. They didn't leave when asked. \n\nThese are all things he did, every time she tried to establish a boundary he tried to push it.  He tried to force the girlfriend role on OP, they were never dating, she was being nice and he was being pushy and controlling, not to mention inappropriate with a minor.", "**He was NOT told not to come.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe said \"he **didn't need** to come to my work.\"  ... a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT message."]}
