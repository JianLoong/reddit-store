He knows my side of the family and I know his, and my parents absolutely adore him, his (autistic) sister even more. It has gotten to the point where every time I invite him over, my parents make me bring his sister as well. I had no problem with that, but by time, it started annoying me. She would always but in our conversations, ask the weirdest questions, always needed my bf\u2019s help for the littlest things, and we had to keep a close eye on her all the time. Let\u2019s call my bf Marcus. Marcus and I had no alone time at all because of his sister, and I can\u2019t tell him to make her stay at home because my parents would feel bad, and so will Marcus. \n\nMarcus\u2019s dad applied for a job 3 hours away from home (by airplane). So he had to go there for the interview. Marcus\u2019s mom was going with him. Marcus then said he wanted to go and meet his friend group there since he hasn\u2019t seen them for years (he used to leave there) and offered to go. His parents agreed and wanted to take his sister (let\u2019s call her alice) with them as no one was there to care for her.\nWhen they were looking for airplane seats, there were only 3 available. As Alice was the youngest they decided to leave her here and asked me to care for her while they were gone for the whole week.\n\nWhen I heard that they wanted me to babysit Alice, I quickly said no. Marcus and his parents were shocked. They immediately asked \u201cwhy?\u201d and I simply said that she was a handful and just annoyed me in general and that I didn\u2019t want to spend my week keeping an eye out/helping a kid with a special needs. His parents were very upset by the way I said it and Marcus called me bitchy. And most importantly, my parents were furious for what I said about Alice.\n\nAITA? and should I apologize?", "created_utc": 1685985947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141lpwg/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_boyfriends/", "score": 958, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When did you sign up to become a caregiver to Alice?  When did you sign up to become a 24-HOUR caregiver to Alice?  Why are Alice's own parents not parenting Alice?  If your parents love Alice so so so much, why aren't *they* volunteering to look after Alice?\n\nAnd why is nobody looking for peers for Alice?  Is Alice the only autistic kid in the entire town?", "NTA for refusing to babysit, that's your right. You definitely are an AH for the way that you phrased it though. You should apologize but I'd honestly be surprised if your relationship survived this.", "NTA- Marcus is using you as a caregiver for his sister. He used to have to shoulder that burden by himself. But now he doesn't. You've been such a huge blessing! The money they save on caregivers with you around has allowed them a family vacation. If Alice can't go, neither should Marcus. I do not even believe there wasn't enough room on the flight. That doesn't sound right to me. Basically, you will see that as a young woman, everyone expects you to just be a free caregiver and to want to be a caregiver to whoever doesn't want to parent their own children. It happens quite a lot. And, if you don't want to be a caregiver they will say something is wrong with you because that's the traditional role of women in our culture. This is not to say that boys are never expected to be caregivers. It is just an acknowledgement that there is a cultural bias towards thinking that women/girls are meant to want to be caregivers and are told there is something wrong with them if they don't fall in line. You will have to be strong if you want to fight against this situation.  Your parents, Marcus, and his parents are all fully committee to seeing you as her caregiver. As if that is normal. It is not normal. And I think you should break up with him over this.", "INFO: how old are you, Marcus and Alice?", "Lol I know people are gonna call you ableist and TA but I severely disagree. NTA. You don\u2019t have to care for someone you don\u2019t feel comfortable with and who actively annoys you. I\u2019ve worked in childcare for years and I refuse to watch or teach autistic children bc I\u2019m not comfortable with it nor am I properly trained for them. It\u2019s a bit of a different scenario for you but it\u2019s probably just a usual case of the parents being offended and overly protective bc their child is autistic.", "NTA. Set the boundaries now if you don't want to help be a care giver at all. I mean the way you said it was a bit harsh, but if you softened it, they might ask again later. This ways stops the asking once and for all.", "NTA. First of all the mom should\u2019ve stayed home to take care of Alice instead of abandoning her and expecting you to take care of her. Second of all by agreeing to date your boyfriend you didn\u2019t also sign up to be a constant caregiver to Alice and it is unfair of anyone to expect you to let her tag along any time you\u2019re going to do something with your boyfriend.", "NTA \n\nYou bring her with you all the time. \nI think you should never feel forced to babysit especially when you're annoyed already. She will probably notice that and feel bad. \n\nMaybe you have to have a conversation with your parents and your bf again and tell them while you could bring her over at times it doesent have to be at all times.", "Yeah so...I think your relationship is kind of over - what you have to learn (and now seems a time good as ever), that when there are issues, you need to talk about them.\n\nYou and Marcus don't seem to have any more time for yourselves but you never mentioned that to your or his parents. Now a situation has come up, where his fsmily actually needs your help, after you fostered an environment that made it seem like you were okay with how things were - and you snapped. What uou said could have been said with more compassion, earlier and in a less mean way.\n\nNow you already come across as ableist, your boyfriend sounds disgusted by your behaviour and so does his family.\n\nNot much to rescue here.\n\nEHS because all adults (I strongly assume you are underage) should have recognised that they should have given you more space, but you also never said anything until it all exploded.", "NTA. You are not obligated to take care of her just because you are dating her brother. And, by their reaction, it sounds like both the parents and your BF were starting to take you for granted and assume you are \u201cpart of the family\u201d where they can assume they can put family obligations on you.", "NTA, I feel like this could definitely be a controversial issue. You're going to have to evaluate this relationship because as long as you date your boyfriend, his sister will be in your life as well.", "NTA, he tried to force you into something you clearly didn\u2019t want. You could\u2019ve worded it better", "NTA the kid isn't your problem and you don't need to be forced to watch a kid that annoys you", "NTA, you are under no obligation to care for someone elses child.", "NTA you have the right to refuse. I just feel like you could\u2019ve phrased it a bit better :)", "Wow so your own parents and his parents basically made you the free babysitter without even asking you first?? Screw that, find a better bf instead. Shame on his parents for thinking it's ok to leave a minor with a reluctant unpaid babysitter. Nta. There's a reason teachers actually get specialised training to care for Children with autism and a lot of babysitters won't even babysit kids with autism, and I bet the parents knew that which is why they booked first before asking you.", "NTA caring for someone who is special needs can be a lot. \nBut It does not make sense. 3h flight for a job interview? Will the family move then if the father gets it? \nPlus, how could a family just go and leave the youngest with someone? \nWould it be logical for the mother to stay with her child and the father and son go together then? \nAlso there must be other flights, surly they can find one with 4 seats.", "Even if Alice was the most neurotypical of neurotypical children in the whole wide world, OP would not be wrong for refusing to take care of the kid - for a whole *week*!\n\nAdding that she is on the spectrum, is just cherry on top of the oh hell no sundae.\n\nNow, OP, you could have been a whole lot more diplomatic about refusing. You really could have. But you were frank in your refusal and your reasons. (Oh, the horror! You were so comfortable in your relationship you thought you could tell your BF what you really thought!)\n\nWell, because you didn\u2019t dance around and politely decline, it gave evvvverybody a handle to latch onto when they were angry and disappointed that you spoiled their plans. And now your BF called you \u201cbitchy\u201d. Well, you can call him \u201centitled\u201d. \n\nNon refundable tickets, the parents bought, did they *even* entertain the thought that OP might say \u201cno\u201d?\n\nMarcus can stay home and watch his sister. By himself, since this is probably the end of your relationship. NTA", "NTA - she's not your problem", "This is a HUGE ask.\n\nIt would be one thing if it were for an afternoon, but presumably this is at least overnight. If you haven't watched his sister for that long before, this is a crazy ask.\n\nCould you have more politely said no? Yes.\n\nBut they should have asked if you were comfortable watching his sister before ever actually asking you to watch her.\n\nAnd it sounds like this is part of a bigger issue. You feel like your relationship isn't just between 2 people but between 3, and that isn't what you signed up for. That's something that yes, you should talk to Marcus about.\n\nBut you should also speak with your parents about. Let them know that you are thrilled that they like Marcus and his sister but that you sometimes need his sister to not be included. That you understand that it's important for his parents to get a break from being caretakers, but that doesn't mean that every time you invite Marcus over- that your parents need to invite his sister. (This is important because whether for this relationship or future relationships- it's a valuable conversation to have with your folks.)\n\nAnd you ultimately need to have the same conversation with Marcus.\n\nThis isn't saying that his sister wouldn't still come and do things with you guys. But that it should be more like 50% of the time. Not 100% of the time.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work for Marcus, that's okay. The two of you may have different needs that don't work for your relationship. That doesn't speak negatively about either of you.\n\nNTA", "Why can't Marcus (or mother) just take a different flight to the same destination, even if it's on a different day? Marcus is seeing friends, he's not on a strict schedule like his dad (not sure of mother's schedule or reason to go). Other than sister, the other three family members are capable of flying alone.\n\nOP refusing to babysit is okay, but the phrasing was terrible. YTA for the poor decision to become brutally honest (i.e. rude af) right then. At least OP won't have to worry about having to spend time with sister (nor with ex-bf and his parents).", "You should apologize for the way you deliver your message. But NTA for refusing the voluntold duty.", "NTA.  You said 'No.'  That should have been sufficient.  When they pushed and asked why, you are not responsible for their take on your honesty.  Marcus should be ashamed of himself and ask your parents if they are volunteering on babysitting Alice for a week.  If you are met with silence from them, ask why on earth this is such a big ask of them?  Yeah, always so easy to judge others when they aren't willing to step up.", "NTA!  The have no right to demand you provide 24x7 care for a special needs person who is not related to you.  That's simply a gross imposition upon you.", "NTA. I think the think that upsets me the most, understanding that you are obviously not her caretaker, is that they\u2019re treating her like a dog that needs to be boarded while they go and do things. She is a member of their family! If there isn\u2019t a seat for her, they find another flight! You wouldn\u2019t just leave with half of your kids, right? They treat her like a burden they can just shove off on other people, and that has been you. They can\u2019t just go to this city and do whatever they want while you act as a free babysitter.", "Nta", "YTA for how you phrased it. There was a polite way to say no- simply stating that 24/7 care was beyond your capabilities and you didn\u2019t feel like you could appropriately provide for her entirely by yourself for that length of time would have been sufficient. Instead you basically blamed her for being too much- and calling her annoying was seriously uncalled for. You\u2019re allowed to say \u201cno,\u201d but you did it in  a way that was really hurtful.", "NTA - a week is a long time to care for someone that you\u2019re not used to caring for full-time. It\u2019s a huge ask. Their reasoning for asking is bizarre; they could easily find other plane tickets or split up and go another flight\u2026 or shorten their stay so the ask wasn\u2019t a whole week. Seems like they wanted a vacation away from her. If that\u2019s the case; sad.", "NTA\n\nYour parents could have volunteered to take care of Alice if it was such an easy thing to do.\n\nIt was an enormous request by your BF\u2019s family and the fact they just assumed you would do this (presumably without financial compensation of any sort) speaks volumes about how they view you.\n\nPlease consider whether you want to continue this relationship. Your parents can still hang out with Alice even if you and Marcus break up.\n\nMaybe you were an asshole for how you phrased things, but I am giving you the benefit of the doubt that you were shocked by the expectation and then they would not accept your saying no.", "NTA. All of these people who are angry at you can babysit her. She is not related to you at all, it is not your job. Back away from the situation with her.", "NTA tbh I don\u2019t think I would be able to take care of a person with autism. Especially for a week. It\u2019s not fair that they assumed you\u2019d be able to but also I think this is a clear break for y\u2019all. She will always be there and it\u2019s obvious that her brother will take her when her parents pass. I just don\u2019t think this sounds like the right situation for you.", "NTA as someone who is a certified registered behavioral therapist it\u2019s not your responsibility to watch her, they need to take care of their daughter themselves. Autistic children are a handful, way more than I normal kid, and to put that responsibility on someone who doesn\u2019t know how to handle her if any behavior issues pop up? That\u2019s a big no no! She could end up hurting herself and her parents could end up blaming it on you for not watching her properly, and believe me, you have to keep an eye on these kids 24:7 this is NOT an easy job. I\u2019ve been in this profession for 4 years. I get burnt out a lot. I\u2019m at the point I might have to take a break or find a different profession. Not that I don\u2019t love these kids, but it\u2019s a lot mentally, physically and emotionally. \nPlease stand your ground. Do not give into watching her.", "NTA.. you are not your boyfriends sisters caretaker. What a presumption", "Info: how old are you, bf and \"Alice\"?\n\nIMO ESH \n\n-You said shitty things, I'd apologize for the way you spoke about her\n\n-Your bf and his family had no right to presume you would babysit someone for an entire week whether they're autistic or not \n\n-Your parents and bf need to set better boundaries with Alice NOW and let you guys have time alone", "Nta", "Sounds to me as if they are interviewing for a two-for one future deal: wife plus child care provider. \n\nNTA and good for you knowing your own limitations and kudos for be able to being able to speak your mind with confidence.", "So, you\u2019re not TA for not wanting to look after her.

Seen about 5 threads to do with them.", "NTA but I really don\u2019t see this relationship moving forward from this. Marcus is very active in his sister\u2019s life and seems to be looking for a partner who would be similarly active in her life, and since your parents love his sister and always \u201cmake\u201d you invite her as well, I can kind of understand why he thought it was wasn\u2019t outlandish to ask you to care for her and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware how much youre annoyed by inviting his sister over all the time (to be fair to him, you do that of your own free will even if your parents do push you to do so). that doesn\u2019t mean youre wrong for not wanting to do it, but you have different priorities. He\u2019s a jerk for calling you bitchy for it though instead of expressing his frustration another way", "Might get downvoted for this since I'm seeing a lot of NTA's but I think people are missing the biggest issue here.\n\nYou're not the asshole for not wanting to babysit her. That would have been a HUGE workload for you, and it's fair to not take that on.\n\nWhere you ARE falling into asshole territory is how you handled it. \"No\" is a complete sentence and you should have started and ended with that. If they had extra pressed on it, you could have just said \"I don't feel like I'm responsible enough to do that\", and you'd still be in the clear. But everything else you said? YTA. You owe your boyfriend and his family an apology for that, but I don't think it will matter because if I were him I'd dump you.\n\nYou should have told your parents you were uncomfortable. You should have told MARCUS you wanted some more 1x1 time with him. Your parents also shouldn't have put that on your, nor should Marcus' parents have pressed you when you said no, but snapping like this when it doesn't seem like they had any reason to believe there was an issue was a dick move. They love their daughter and Marcus clearly loves his sister. You were mean. I get that you were bottling up resentment over a long period of time, but that's why communication is so important. You fucked up bad on the phrasing, and are on your way to single-town.", "Definitely NTA for not agreeing to become a weeklong caregiver, but you are TA for phrasing it in that way. A simple, 'I'm not comfortable with such a huge responsibility for an extended period' would have sufficed.", "You\u2019re NTA for refusing to babysit, that girl isn\u2019t your responsibility. But wow, your phrasing was god awful. You really should apologize for how you worded it.", "\u201cBabysit\u201d is two to maybe five or six hours while family takes bf to a college interview. They asked for 24/7 for a WEEK?! And they think YOU are in the wrong? No no no no no. \n\nWhere\u2019s grandma and grandpa? Or how about they ask YOUR PARENTS, because they are ADULTS  who have been PARENTS. \n\nUnless you and your bf are in your mid20s which I\u2019m guessing you are not because you both live home with parents, their request is unreasonable. And your parents are in the wrong to criticize you. They can offer to take Alice themselves. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents need to step up.  You need to make a stand.  Everyone is taking advantage of you.  It sounds like Marcus, awesome as he is, has found a permanent babysitter for his sister.  Tell Marcus he should stay home with his sister while you go have fun.", "NTA Could have worded it a lot better. But you will end up the caretaker if you think you will be with this guy long term hes a package deal with the sister.", "NTA - you should have just said you don't want to babysit 24/7 without bringing up Alice's special needs.

If you're not comfortable watching someone like that, no one has any business pressuring you. I wouldn't want that responsibility either.", "NTA. If you're not comfortable watching someone like that, no one has any business pressuring you. I wouldn't want that responsibility either. Would have been more tactful to mention that instead of saying \"she's annoying\", however.", "NTA. They should pay for babysitter that is qualified to take care of child that needs extra care and attention.\n\nAlthough,  you could have left the annoying bit out.", "NTA for saying no but kind of an AH for how you said it. No is a full sentence. Saying she annoyed you and pointing out that she's special needs was unnecessary.", "NTA, she really isn't your responsibility. Could have maybe worded it kinder, but that was a huge reach on their part, so not a big deal.\n\nThis is very strange though, sounds more like they treat his sister like his daughter... Maybe the plan is he (you?) takes over as her carer in the future? No idea, but I'd probably nope out of that family situation.", "NTA.", "NTA, you are allowed to have your feelings. However you needed to have some tact. Like I can\u2019t because I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that level of responsibility. But let me ask my parents if they would be okay.", "NTA\n\nYou are not required to babysit your bf\u2019s sister. \n\nHowever as your parents are upset with your decision welcome them to coordinate with your bf\u2019s family so they can signup to watch Alice for a week. \n\nI will say you REALLY could have been way more polite with declining. You could have said you weren\u2019t up to spending 24/7 for a week caring for Alice.  Saying she annoys you when she is around just may be how your relation ends with bf as I suspect his family likely sees you as a fake for including Alice in visits.", "NTA. When I was in Junior High my parents volunteered me to watch their friends autistic child. He couldn\u2019t feed himself and was confined to a wheelchair. It was honestly the worst month of my life. I had to come straight home from school and watch him until his mom came 3-5 hours later. I was a child watching a child. Now as an adult you\u2019d think I\u2019d have patience for it, nope. It\u2019s ok to say no. You know what you can handle and what you cannot.", "Have you talked to your BF about his sister's living arrangements when his parents get older?

But, I would have phrased it..  She is way more than I can handle.", "NTA. The delivery was harsh and your boyfriend might break up with you. \n\nHowever, as parents, your boyfriend\u2019s parents should have realized the instant they saw there were only 3 tickets that either one parent or your boyfriend were going to have to stay home. Not just their autistic daughter. If she requires a caregiver and there aren\u2019t enough seats on the plane to include her then one of the parents or brother stays home. \n\nIt sounds like maybe they (your boyfriend and his parents) all wanted a break from Alice and decided to go about it this way. If I\u2019m right, it\u2019s kind of manipulative and definitely not cool. Have they never paid anyone to babysit her while your boyfriend is out and they have/want to do something without Alice? This just feels planned to me. Maybe I\u2019m reading to much into it. Maybe I\u2019m too pessimistic.", "Apologize for nothing.

He is a HUGE handful, and I would never want to put someone I love in that caretaker position.\n\n(Though I would have avoided the mention of her being annoying, since saying her needs are too vast for you, someone she\u2019s only known for a year, is a fine reason) \n\nNow, it\u2019s good to set your boundaries.

My older sister and I were his guards growing up, we had to fight a lot of bully\u2019s off (and this includes rude adults.)\n\nI\u2019m sure he has also been raised with the idea that he needs to be there and be the caretaker for his sister, I\u2019m sure (unfortunately) all parents with autistic children do this to the other siblings. \n\nHe has had it drilled into his head that his sister, because of her autism, take priority. And because of this indoctrination he is under the impression that you are on the same wavelength on the matter.\n\nHe may see himself as her caretaker in the future, and since you are together he is presuming you would be involved too, since he sees her as his responsibility.", "NTA, but I do think you should apologize for how you said it.

Just simply saying you did not want to be responsible and care for her for an entire week would have been enough without the \u201cannoying\u201d part.

It's possible you'll loose the relationship, but you all might be better off for it. They might need something different and so might you. That's okay.

He knows my side of the family and I know his, and my parents absolutely adore him, his (autistic) sister even more. It has gotten to the point where every time I invite him over, my parents make me bring his sister as well. I had no problem with that, but by time, it started annoying me. She would always but in our conversations, ask the weirdest questions, always needed my bf\u2019s help for the littlest things, and we had to keep a close eye on her all the time. Let\u2019s call my bf Marcus. Marcus and I had no alone time at all because of his sister, and I can\u2019t tell him to make her stay at home because my parents would feel bad, and so will Marcus. \n\nMarcus\u2019s dad applied for a job 3 hours away from home (by airplane). So he had to go there for the interview. Marcus\u2019s mom was going with him. Marcus then said he wanted to go and meet his friend group there since he hasn\u2019t seen them for years (he used to leave there) and offered to go. His parents agreed and wanted to take his sister (let\u2019s call her alice) with them as no one was there to care for her.\nWhen they were looking for airplane seats, there were only 3 available. As Alice was the youngest they decided to leave her here and asked me to care for her while they were gone for the whole week.\n\nWhen I heard that they wanted me to babysit Alice, I quickly said no. Marcus and his parents were shocked. They immediately asked \u201cwhy?\u201d and I simply said that she was a handful and just annoyed me in general and that I didn\u2019t want to spend my week keeping an eye out/helping a kid with a special needs. His parents were very upset by the way I said it and Marcus called me bitchy. And most importantly, my parents were furious for what I said about Alice.\n\nAITA? and should I apologize?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You could have put the onus on yourself, e.g. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of safely being in charge of her care.

That's despicable, you can be way nicer. Communication is the most important thing in a relationship and you failed greatly. You should've told people you wanted more time alone with your bf, and that you were getting overwhelmed with the responsibility. People can't read your mind. I wouldn't be surprised if your bf left you over this, that's such a shitty thing to say. \"I find your sister annoying\" how do you not realize that is mean.\n\nYou're NOT obligated to babysit her, but damn are you an asshole otherwise.", "I think you could have probably worded it better than \"your sister annoys me so no\" but you're certainly NTA for not being willing to take full time care of a special needs child for a whole week. You two have been dating for 1 YEAR. They honestly shouldn't be comfortable with asking you to do this. Maybe a wife or fiancee, but gf of 1 year? That's super irresponsible.\n\nAlso \"we couldn't find 4 seats together so oh well\" is a super sus reason to leave 1 whole daughter out of what is now essentially a family trip. It reeks of the parents wanting a holiday from their kid and trying to skirt around paying for a full time caregiver. Do they not have any other family to watch her?

She is just going to have a fun trip. Second, your BF doesn't have to go away with friends. Third, you cannot take charge of a minor while all of the family is away. Aren't you a minor as well? What if she needs to go to the hospital?\n\nDump your BF. His family is going to make her live with you and you are going to be her care taker for her whole life.\n\nAlso, stop involving your parents in your private life!\n\nAre you a people pleaser?", "What I get here is that OP acted all cool and happy in the beginning about the little sister because she wanted the brother regardless, plain and simple, he was a catch. However this young man is VERY involved with his sister and spends an inordinate amount of time with her to his credit. He thought he found a gf who not only understood this but who was down for this lifestyle as well when clearly she is NOT! She's been hiding her disdain towards this disabled person until now so everyone including her own parents are shocked by her lack of compassion etc. \nThese two are NOT compatible and she needs to just cut her losses and walk away. This was a BIG ask indeed but she fooled then into thinking she loved being the big supportive FSIL who would blend into their family smoothly. \nAs the grandparent of an autistic teenager I find her attitude and comments disturbing and a deal-breaker! Her lack of compassion towards the girl and disdain for her situation was terrible. \nI think Marcus should be staying home while Alice accompanied her parents on the flight. It was okay to decline their request absolutely based on her  inexperience, time constraints or anything besides insulting the girl and being unkind about it to boot. But Your true feelings about her probably sunk your battleship with him so be prepared to just move on. You're NOT the best match for him or his family! In fact don't pair up with anyone who has any disabled family members because you're not a supportive person in reality. \nFor the record, Autistic people can be fun and engaging when you actually want to work/play with them.

You refused to babysit and you told the truth about why.

Unless I missed it, I don't see where you ever indicated you wanted to be her caregiver.  Since there's conveniently only 3 seats for the only flight and your folks love Alice so much, I'm sure they'd be thrill to look after her for an entire week!\n\nWhere you enter ahole territory is what you said during your outburst.

Kids say stuff like that all the time. \"Mom, sissy is being annoying!\" And, \"mom, can you make sissy stop, she is being annoying!\" And, \"mom, I don't want to bring sissy along bc she is annoying!\" What she said is not the end of the world and is pretty normal for kids. We don't know how old she is but this should be a good indicator that an autistic child should not be just pawned off on young people as a way to get her out of the house.

None of us was diagnosed back then, but the kids I got along with best were autistic in the same way as me.  \n\nWhen other people came along to butt into our parallel play interspersed with happy nerd talk and tell us we were socializing wrong...that's when it got annoying.", "Yeah, I'm reading this like op and Marcus are college ish age, and his sister is in like mid high school and just somewhat annoying socially, but doesn't really need much supervision besides making sure she doesn't throw a party or burn the house down. Which would explain why everyone is pissed she is using Alice's disability as the reason...", "INFO: What's the age of literally anyone involved in this story??", "What made me think it's fake is that OP said there was only 3 seats left on the flight as if that was their only reasonable choice.", "You could have phrased it as it\u2019s a big responsibility and you don\u2019t feel up for the task and also have commitments in the up coming week that wouldn\u2019t allow you to give 100% of your time to bf sister\u2026", "The whole trip is odd from start to finish. Why is his mom going on his dad\u2019s job interview? Why must he also travel that week? Just weird.", "she said no, they asked for the reason why. maybe the parents can learn from this that no is a full sentence and not to have such high expectations of others to cater to their needs. The mom doesn\u2019t need to go on this trip, she just wants to.", "Whilst I agree that your suggestion should be acceptable. We don't really know if Alice's parents and brother would accept it or if they would attempt to handwave OPs concerns away.\n\nI can easily imagine \"Oh what do you mean, she's no trouble!\"; \"You two get along great, and your parents love her!\" or words to that effect.", "Yep I agree!", "Depending on where they are on the spectrum yes you do. I\u2019ve had kids who were autistic and most of the time there weren\u2019t too many issues, then turn around and the same kid physically harmed one of my other teachers due to a meltdown that we DID NOT have experience or training on how to handle. You can have patience and compassion all you want but still have your own boundaries on what you want to handle lol. Some people can and want to work with them, I don\u2019t have to be forced to when, again, I\u2019m not trained properly.", "I agree to everything you said, the problem is the way OP worded their issues to bf and parents, and also said nothing about it at all until she snapped and brain dumped and hurt people's feelings.\n\nIn a healthy situation OP would have brought it up with bf and/or Alice's parents well before this point, when she first started feeling uncomfortable/unhappy with the situation.\n\nThe issue is with OPs lack of communication, not their unwillingness to provide free support to a child with needs, that unwillingness is fully understandable.", "this was my thought, there's a major difference and to drop it on her is massively unfair of a family that whoa hey, could only find 3 tickets.", "I would have been on a warpath of blaming his parents for even asking except her reasoning for the \u2018no\u2019 was rude and hurtful and I can\u2019t get past that. \n\nOp doesn\u2019t give ages for anyone so that does play a bit of a role, but the parents definitely shouldn\u2019t have asked or should have have offered to compensate her well and let her know that there was no pressure to accept since they already know it\u2019s a big ask", "The fact they have booked non-refundable tickets before asking you shows how they feel entitled to your help. You were right to say no but you should have been less harsh.\n\nAlso perhaps your parents can take care of her as they are against your decision.", "Dump Marcus and his family now! This is BS! Remind your parents your are their daughter not Alice.", "NTA for saying no. But definitely YTA for how you phrased it.", "Very little is non refundable if you call airlines and give a good reason", "Or even better \"why don't you take courses in nursing it will make you feel more confident in taking care of our kid when we don't want to\"", "\u201cYour parents will be right there if there\u2019s trouble!\u201d Yeah, no.", ">Alice loves you and she'll be no trouble at all!\" Yeah, no.\n\n\"If she'll be no trouble at all, then you should take her with, I'm unavailable.\" Simple.", "Yeah I agree what she said was a little harsh but again that\u2019s why I have a feeling that this isn\u2019t the right relationship", "Even at 16-20, you should know well enough to be a bit more diplomatic instead of it erupting out of your mouth. But maybe that\u2019s just me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree. I\u2019m still curious about the ages.", "Bad bot", "What?", "Agree with you 100%. \n\nJust because the words aren't what other people might say out loud, being with this kid all the time is certainly annoying af. \n\nAll of this is also insane to me... this relationship is only a year old!", "I agree NTA for not wanting to be saddled with this, but if you make boundaries your whole life by tearing the pin out of a grenade and tossing it into an occupied building while you walk away, your boundary will be moot because ain't nobody going to want to be with you anyway,", "True but if you are old enough to date someone for a year and to be left alone with their special needs sister,  that means you are old enough to learn to watch your tongue.  Some things you don't say,  even if you are young. She didn't have to agree to the babysitting.  Heck, she should set  boundaries regarding tagging along on their dates. But you don't call a disabled person annoying to their parents' face.  That's incredibly rude.", "Like I said, in my experience as a mother of autistic kids and have a few autistic family members, they often get irritated by autistic peers, especially my son.  Doesn't mean everyone.  But, I have never sought out to make him friends that were autistic,  I just let nature happen and let him be friends with who he wants.", "She's dependent enough on her brother to come on every date he has to OP's house. That doesn't sound like \"doesn't really need much supervision\".  That sounds like the parents were already trying to off-load her onto another family every chance they got instead of helping her to develop her own friendships with people her own age.", "Of course. Just keep laying it on nice and thick.", "And then when there were only three seats, they decided to leave the youngest person who can't stay home alone. Because logic.", "yup. people shouldnt ask for more info/why if they dont want to hear it.", "I dunno, to me this reads of someone that is 16, to which I would probably also get more info about the 'no'. Also I think the mom does need to go as it's important... Because they will be moving 3 hours away.\nBut we have basically no info here!", "\u2018Depending on where they are on the spectrum yes you do \u2018 \n\nMe : it would only be the children with more severe care needs \n\nI mean \u2026 \ud83d\ude05\n\nBeing autistic myself and having autistic kids I\u2019m very aware of how quickly a kid can have a meltdown .. and what that can look like . If a child is having a meltdown in class then their general needs are overlooked . Like I said compassion and patience . You don\u2019t need special training to know a child doesn\u2019t like to be touched or is triggered by an overload of sensory input . \n\nNobody said you should be forced to do anything \n\nHave a great day", "I agree she was too harsh. However, after she said no, they shouldn't have asked her why. It was obvious it was already a big ask.", "She didn't explain the no, first. They shouldn't have asked further as it was already a big ask. I agree it was way too harsh but just asking why when she said no shows they feel entitled to her (free) help.", "Yeah. Marcus also deserves someone who will loving embrace the family He has not the family they want it to be.", "ehhh it\u2019s iffy if it\u2019s younger, should they be able to? sure. can they? probably not to be honest. especially when dealing with a parent/person in authority a high school sophomore/junior isn\u2019t gonna react the best, which isn\u2019t helped (if im understanding correctly) by the bfs parents pushing for a why after the no.", "Love your username 10/10 would watch that show \ud83e\udd23", "Even well behaved kids with no issues are annoying to be around. I wish OP had given her age but why would a young person want to spend all their time with a high needs kid who isn\u2019t even related to them \n\nHer parents probably love the kid being around all the time because its a big cock block situation, and how ever old they are, they still deserve a little privacy to at least have conversation", "This girl has literally tolerated her BFs sister tagging along on nearly everything they do. Plus the families reaction is to just\u2026 attempt to drop the special needs kid on her then GET ANGRY she wouldn\u2019t do it. If there is a time to set boundaries this would be the time.", "So when did the word annoying become a slur to you people? It\u2019s a descriptor, not a grave insult and a valid reason to not want to hang out with someone for a week. The parents kept pressing the issue. They don\u2019t get to be upset when it\u2019s not the answer they want. Also had anyone considered the parents let Alice fall by the wayside for this trip because traveling with her would be\u2026annoying?", "> It has gotten to the point where every time I invite him over, my parents make me bring his sister as well. \n\nBut, it's OP's parents who want the sister to come with Marcus! So, the whole thing is weird, because why wouldn't they watch Alice if they love her so much, or at least in combo with OP? It seems like she wouldn't be all by herself - but somebody in this story other than Marcus' dad has to work? It sounds like OP lives with her parents, but these days, that could be any age.", "So weird that you think teenagers don\u2019t get autonomy when it comes to what they will or won\u2019t do for others. If it comes to moving then they should take a trip as a family there and I don\u2019t see why the rest of the family couldn\u2019t take another plane that had more seats.", "Why does the mom need to go to a job interview location with her spouse?", "It's an interview,  so he isn't guaranteed the job. It's when he gets the offer letter that they should visit and make the decision. It's just an excuse to take a trip. Like other people said, they could go on a later day. There is no reason for the mom to NEED to go at all.", "I think there is so much going on here. Asking in the first place is a lot and they do act entitled. Not that it makes it ok, but I wonder if she has gone out of her way to give the impression that she adores the sister and that she proactively seeks out time with her. Maybe the parents were swayed by that and didn\u2019t quite realize how big an ask it would be. They would still suck though just minutely less.", "We all say things in the heat of the moment that we wish we could take back. I guess it depends whether there was time to think about the response (even just a couple of minutes), or not. \n\nI kinda feel like OP hasn\u2019t shown any remorse for what she said/how she said it. Unless there are other comments from them saying so, in which case I would reconsider my viewpoint.", "Aw thank you kindly!", "Ha ha! Me too", "We're quibbling here. She won't have a boyfriend after this. It might be for the best for her, sounds like. However, she will still have parents and ostensibly these are the parents that taught her boundaries in the first place. \n\nThe resentment that comes from stuffing your needs down your whole life in service of or in deference to others does not go away without a whole lot of practice. I'm 42 and still checking in with myself on what I'm doing for me authentically versus what unhealthy scripts I'm recycling from my mother's mother and her mother. \n\nI don't think it's helpful to call what she did a boundary. It was a rightful explosion after feeling infringed upon over and over and then feeling walked all over. Good for her, I totally agree. \n\nOP seems young and will hopefully have time and therapy to help her identify and name this sort of exploitive or uncomfortable dynamic earlier so she doesn't have to burn it all down. A boundary is a well-tended fence, not a forest fire, I guess that's all I'm saying.", "It sounds made up, tbh. \n\nBut it also sounds like within  the story OP's parents find the sister endearing but notably they *didn't* volunteer to be caregivers for her when bf's parents were away, they just were shocked at OP's reluctance tried to pressure her. \n\nThey assume that OP would just naturally be happy to take on a quasi-parental role (because she's young and female).", "Definitely get autonomy, just usually also comes with more questions.\nNot saying this is fair, just working out what's happening, I also think it's crazy to fly when you can just drive or FaceTime."]}
