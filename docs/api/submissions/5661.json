The other sister in law used my credit card to purchase tickets for four to go to Disney, with the agreement she would give. Me $1000 at the time of booking, and the balance before the next payment cycle. Here we are 5 months later, I\u2019m still waiting on payment. Made two payments, have skipped ever since, and never even a phone call to say I\u2019m late, is that ok?  I have since built a spreadsheet with all the money owed and have charged a $40 dollar late fee for the missed payments, as well as 18.9% APR compounded monthly on the monies owed. This is after a long series of getting fucked like this. Wife says ITA since I make a lot, have an 825 credit score and they don\u2019t.

You have a wife problem bigger than an in law problem. Have you talked to her about it, given that this is a repeated occurrence. The last minute notification seems a convenient explanation.  The family seems to know that they can use your wife as an ATM. \n\nDo you have separate finances or merged?

Who gave your credit card to your SIL? I see a multitude of issues here that need fixing. As far as charging interest? Go for it.

They are selfish people and you think charging interest solves that. \n\nStop letting these people use your credit card. Cut them off. You\u2019re not their bank to fund there trips. Helping out to pay for the father\u2019s surgery is great, but then having them go on trips without covering the share you and your wife covered shows how selfish they are.", "My wise old dad once told me, \"You should never loan anything that you expect (or worse yet, need) to be returned or repaid.\" \n\n\"It's perfectly okay to lend a hand to a friend in need\", he'd say, \"but you must be prepared to think of it as 'a gift or a gamble', much like playing the lottery...Any other mindset could quickly turn a dear friend into an enemy.\" \n\nThat was some of the best adult-level advice I ever learned as a young kid. \n\nI still loan objects and money and/or pay for things things that someone I care for has promised to return or pay back, but I do so knowing that the onus is on me, not them. This mindset has allowed me to appreciate every attempt someone might make to pay it back, and also compels me to 'pay it forward', whenever they do.", "NTA, however save yourself the trouble going forward and dont pay for anything for them.", "NTA. Were I in your situation, I\u2019d just write all of the money off as a loss, tell everyone you forgive their debt, and make it 100% clear that they\u2019re never to borrow any more money from you ever again! Just wipe your hands of the whole situation and be done with it.", "YTA for charging interest on loans. NTA for giving money in critical emergency situations. Which u should consider medical proceed moneys gone, never getting that back. And as far as I can see, these monies should only be given in emergency situations, not this Disney bs. Disney (fun stuff) should not even be lent or your credit card borrow. money should only for the parents life critical procedures nothing for the siblings cause they should start planning their retirement/savings now not you (or your wife) helping them in 20s years. \n\nyour wife needs to stop assuming you\u2019d just give her family money (unless u are a multi-millionaire and they aren\u2019t even breaking 65k) , y\u2019all need to talk. Older siblings making decisions cause diff culture or not, who ever pony\u2019s up Calls the shots. So they either include you or stop expecting your generosity.", "YTA - Not because you make a lot, or because of your credit score, or any of the other little justifications people use when they feel entitled to your money, but because you're changing the deal after the deal.  If you want to charge them 200% interest on the next loan, I would happily say NTA, but the existing loans need to remain as agreed upon.  They obviously suck, but that doesn't mean you should suck with them.  Realistically, you will probably never see repayment anyway, so my advice would be to never loan them money again, and maybe even take them to court to recoup what you can, within the confines of the original agreement.", "Well to be fair, they showed up at the doctors office and she was sort of on the spot. She only got on me when I said I\u2019m going to let them know they each owe you about $335 each and I expect paying it back to be a priority. Heck, had they consulted me prior and said the fourth sibling had no money, I would have kicked in his share. Instead I get blindsided with $1000 expense I wasn\u2019t anticipating. My wife is the youngest of two older sisters, and they make all the plans without consulting us; and then dictate to all. They are horrible money managers, but in the Latin families older siblings are in charge no matter how inept.", "Wife clearly knows it\u2019s not ok and feels terrible.

That\u2019s when the fun began.", "I don\u2019t expect to get the interest, but it may be a nice way to illustrate the alternative of the real world vs having family help out and the importance of upholding those obligations.", "That\u2019s the best advice yet. I\u2019m not a bank, so don\u2019t make the loans I the first place.", "I should clarify on the surgery. Fathers destitute. Needs cataract surgery on one eye. Price $4000. There are a total of four kids. My wife, two older sisters, and a brother. All four agreed to an equal split after going to the GRANDCHILDREN asking for money and they all refused, rightly so. We are talking about a man that has not seen his  kids in twenty years, only now that his health is declining. Get to the outpatient facility for surgery the day of, and the brother no shows. Now they are $1000 short. Neither sister can cover it. Wife can. She goes ahead and covers it. I find out a month later when she asks me to help pay her credit card bill. I see the Dr.s Charge and sat WTF, you share was $1000, why did you get stuck with half?  This was June, she just now told me what happened. She thought they would pay her back the following month before the statement cycle and I would never know. Keep in mind, this is her personal card I have no access to. We maintain joint bank and credit card accounts I had when we got married, but she has several of her own exclusively that I have no access to and don\u2019t want access to.", "They\u2019ve actually told her what do I care, I can just sell one of my expensive watches to cover the whole surgery. I pray to God I am not a burden on my kids in my old age. This guy cheated on their mom, abused them, and they still live and take care of him like he\u2019s Ward fucking Cleaver, after being estranged for 29 years. Even had the balls to keep smoking after the surgery and diagnosis of glaucoma and being specifically told not to smoke, and asking me to lie about it to my wife. I told him in my broken Spanish that being a liar was his forte, and if he wants to smoke, do it elsewhere. When I asked him where he got the smokes, it was from the one kid that didn\u2019t contribute to the surgery.", "I\u2019m not wanting to charge interest on the medical stuff. Earlier, I said had they come to me first; I would have paid in and written it off. These are folks that use title loans to pay for unexpected expenses. I\u2019ve offered to negotiate and work through the paperwork, but those offers are refused on the basis that this is \u201cfamily business\u201d and they handle family business in the family.", "In charge of whom? Tell your wife to grow a damn spine", "Siblings should stop getting to you through her. She needs to be better at saying no and walking away and meaning business otherwise they always expect you all to help when shit goes south.", "She grows a spine or you cut off access to your money", "Did you get a Promissory Note from everyone???", "Very true. You and your wife should have a conversation about your finances and how this whole dynamic affects all of you. As for the money you've already loaned, good luck getting it back.", "The dads been gone 20 years and y\u2019all paying for his medical bills? Dude what level of generosity is this? I mean, good for you guys. I don\u2019t have it in me, that\u2019s for sure, Karma is def gonna get me. Oy.", "Wow- there\u2019s a lot in there. Charging them interest just makes you look cheap. Just cut them off financially if you feel contributing to their family is a burden.", "Still standby what I said- you call the shots (in these bigger money discussions) or stop expecting your generosity. \n\nIt\u2019s not family business if they don\u2019t pay you back! Ugh. While I did say you are the asshole for charging interest on loans, they (family) are bigger assholes for not making an honest effort to repay you in a timely manner or manners that was discussed per the borrowing terms \u201cfamily business\u201d", "It\u2019s not a burden. It\u2019s disrespectful.", "I\u2019m not going to expect the interest money. Want to use it as a teaching lesson on why your zero interest banker is the last guy you want to piss off. Lender of last resort usually charges like 25%. My wife\u2019s family helped me out of a jam about a dozen years ago. Cost $5000. I realized it took moving heaven and earth to raise that money. I lived in my car and mowed lawns during the recession of 2008 and paid it all back in 2 months. They are good people, just think that favor grants them this treatment of me?", "You have the means to contribute more. Some cultures see that as a responsibility of family and not doing that is disrespectful.\n\nCharging interest is cheap and petty. It bothers you so just cut them off financially.", "It sounds like there\u2019s some black market family business history loan terms that me as well as others here aren\u2019t gonna fully understand. That said- I\u2019m glad u are so understanding and generous, however I fear that your interest rate theory will not illustrate the lesson intended and they might just keep borrowing money and slow to pay back? And then what? You\u2019ll just keep lending, hoping one day that money comes through when you have your own financial emergency? And if it doesn\u2019t? \n\nI mean it\u2019s fine with what you elect to do and live with, but just be def very ready to accept that whatever amount you lend out , you should be ready to accept it\u2019s gone or end relationships cause family money is COMPLICATED."]}
