Her daughter is one of my current students.", "selftext": "Sorry if I format this wrong, I've never posted on Reddit before.\n\nI (64F) taught a young woman who I'll call Anne about 15 years ago. Anne and I were very close and I was one of her favorite teachers. As a teacher, I can't have favorites, but if I did, she would have been one of them. Anne was one of the smartest students I've ever had the pleasure of teaching and she wanted to become a doctor. Anne's parents were immigrants from a very conservative country and at first, they supported her ambitions, but after they found out that Anne had a boyfriend, they didn't let her go to college and forced her to marry a man from their culture while she was in her last semester of high school.\n\nWe had orientation for the new freshmen last week and I was there to give a presentation for the parents. After the presentation, Anne came up to me and introduced herself. Her daughter is entering ninth grade this year. I didn't recognize her at first but remembered her almost immediately after she told me who she was. I am always excited to see my old students, so I hugged her and asked her to come into my classroom to chat while her daughter toured the campus.\n\nAnne and her husband moved to another city shortly after she graduated. She has three daughters and left her abusive husband when the oldest was seven. She moved back to our town a few months ago. We talked for a bit and before leaving, we exchanged phone numbers and Anne invited me to her home for dinner. I told her that I'd have to check with admin first. I talked to our vice principal and he said it's fine since I know Anne and we live in a pretty small town where everyone knows everyone. \n\nShe invited me to come on Saturday and that morning my son called and asked if I could watch my grandchildren that evening because he had to go to a wedding and the babysitter canceled. I told him that I'm busy and he should have asked before. He asked me what I'm doing and I told him. He said that it's unethical to go to a student's house for any reason and I should be watching his children instead. He couldn't find anyone else to babysit so his wife had to go to the wedding alone.\n\nHe called me the next morning to tell me that I'm behaving very inappropriately and this will send the wrong message to my other students. I don't believe I did anything wrong because the vice principal allowed it and Anne is a former student who I was very close to.

The vice principal didn't have a problem with it, their opinion is the one that matters, not your son and his attempted guilt trip.", "NTA, OP, you had plans and were not available to babysit. Granny here, and we are allowed to have other plans, priorities and responsibilities. I realize that your daughter-in-law was disappointed, however you raised your children; it's their turn to do the same.", "You already had plans (which you had cleared with your supervisors).\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have partied with a few of my teachers, part of the joy of growing up. \nI consider the relationships I formed with teachers in high-school set the stepping stones for all of my Profesional adult relationships. Even in professional  settings you can make friends. Friends are friends and they care about each other. \n\nYour boy is just gaslighting you because he didn't get his way.", "NTA. You already cleared this with your boss. Your son needed to parent, and couldn\u2019t always expect that you\u2019d be available.", "NTA\n\nYou had plans, you cleared them with your administration. Your son is just mad you didn't drop everything for him.", "NTA.  It is entirely appropriate to have dinner with a former K12 student, particularly one who is distant and old enough to have their own kids.  My family is full of teachers who have gone to their students' college graduation parties, weddings, and reunions as special invites.  For the ones they mentored, or helped through a crisis, or just had a great relationship with, it can be great to touch base years later.  One German exchange student tracked down my mom by sending me a letter at my work address after more than a decade.  She cried receiving his letter.  You met as teacher and student with an inherent power differential.  You now meet as friends on equal footing.  You cannot affect her grades, or her scholarships, or her detention, or her college plans.\n\nAlso, even as a grandmother, you are an adult woman.  You can have your own life and commitments and vacations and social engagements outside of your son's life.  It doesn't matter if you had a date with a lover, a friend, a colleague, or an old student.  You had a prior commitment and an obligation to them.  This wasn't an emergency.  Your social calendar counts as much as his.", "NTA- I\u2019m still in touch with two of my favorite teachers. If I lived close to them, I would absolutely invite them for dinner. They greatly impacted my world. And it sounds like you were a shining memory for Anne. Getting to introduce her favorite teacher to her kids was probably a really warm and fuzzy moment for Anne after what sounds like some rough times. \n\nYour son is being a brat. He didn\u2019t get what he wanted when he wanted it. Tell him he\u2019s too old to throw a hissy and to build a bridge and get over it.  He doesn\u2019t get to police what you do with your time. You are not on call to babysit 24:7 either. How entitled and rude.", "NTA. You already committed to a prior engagement, and it isn't your problem that your son doesn't have a babysitter lined up. It's that simple, and his telling your you're behaving very inappropriately is gaslighting, and way out of line on his part.", "NTA - Your son insults you to get you to babysit. It's fine for him to ask but you have a life and you made commitments. His ask was overbearing. His insults are not applicable. You did nothing wrong. Enjoy yourself!", "NTA. The only part that is relevant to your son's request is that you had a prior commitment so aren't available to babysit.\n\nHow you know the person you are meeting is relevant to you and you checked with your employer that that part isn't an issue, but that element of the situation is none of your son's business.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine to have a life of your own.", "NTA", "My best friend\u2019s mother was my 5th grade teacher.

It\u2019s unfortunate your adult I-can-run-my-own-life offspring had a complication in a social activity.  It\u2019s assumed from the lack of emergency that he was not a member of the bridal party or the officiant, but merely a guest.  But, his social activity does not trump yours.  You were unavailable, regardless of the reason.  He should have pulled up his big boy pants and solved the problem, not whined and found a reason to malign your choice.  You were right.  He\u2019s wrong.", "NTA\n\nAnne isn't even your current student...", "YTA - You couldn't do a last minute favor to watch your grandkid when your son needed your help through no fault of his own? \n\nThe dinner at the former student's house is irrelevant.
