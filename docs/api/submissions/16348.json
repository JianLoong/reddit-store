It's helping him feel better about himself and gives us some needed time apart since we're both WFH. The issue is how he deals with the inevitable soreness afterwards: moans, groans, and gripes galore. I've tried to ignore it and let him vent, but it's distracting and really starting to grate on my nerves. I don't mind an occasional \"oof\" or \"ouch\" or \"man I shouldn't have done that\", but he's making some sort of grumble nearly every time he moves and it just seems excessive. It doesn't help that I was raised to see this kind of behavior as attention-seeking, and learned to refrain from making a bunch of racket unless it was a) involuntary/a severe injury or b) something I needed help with - like saying ow when a bandage was being applied too tightly.\n\nThis goes along with his general tendency for random outbursts and saying unrelated stuff when I'm nearby. It makes me think I need to stop what I'm doing and interrupt my inner monologue to pay attention to him because he's talking to me, but it'll just be him talking to himself about his work/games/etc. I'll ask what he said and his usual reply is \"oh nothing, don't worry about it\" - which would be fine if I could actually do that, but my anxious brain won't let me just ignore when he says stuff. So I just keep getting interrupted and bothered for no reason, and due to my executive dysfunction, it can take a while for me to get back into the flow of things. I've tried to explain this to him, but either it's just not getting through or he doesn't think it matters. His interruptions ironically are easier to deal with when I'm actively working since I have other stuff to focus on/get back to, but it's hell when I'm trying to relax and keep getting yanked out of that state.\n\nI hit my limit tonight while I was trying to read and I finally asked him to vocalize less. I just couldn't deal with it anymore since I'm fairly certain I'm already coming down with a migraine (still getting the hang of predicting them), and he's made some extra groan or complaint *every time* he's sat down or stood up since he got back from the gym this morning.

Having someone NEVER be quiet near you is beyond exhausting. You can't ever focus. I had to adjust to the same exact thing with my bf. \n\nHowever, you should really learn to handle this better. Communicate sooner, don't let it fester. Have a talk about needing quiet time, tell him you love interacting with him but you just need downtime sometimes. Then tell him when you need it \"My love, I need a bit of quiet time right now, is this an okay time for you?\" Or whatever your version is of that. Everyone gets their needs fulfilled and he doesn't feel like he annoyed you just for existing/being himself.", "I don't know why so many are saying you suck. Had a roommate that used to do this and it was so annoying. He had to make noise; loud sneezes, yawns, whatever. Great dude but I eventually had to tell him to STFU. He didn't even realize he was doing it.\n\n\nNAH.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019ve been around people like that and if you have executive dysfunction or are sensitive to noise it\u2019s a real problem. It\u2019s also not his \u2018fault\u2019 it\u2019s just how he is - as you say he\u2019s not purposefully interrupting you or trying to get you to engage with him when you\u2019re busy. \n\nSo this is a fit/compatibility issue rather than an AH issue - neither his constant noise nor your inability to block out extraneous vocalisation is inherently wrong, they just clash. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to expect him to stifle himself in his own home but nor is it fair for anyone to expect you to live with what to me sounds like the equivalent of someone following you round with a chalkboard and scraping their nails down it at frequent (but unpredictable) intervals. You both need to be able to feel comfortable at home. \n\nI\u2019d suggest investing in some good noise cancelling headphones and telling him that, because you\u2019re easily distracted you\u2019re going to wear the headphones whenever you\u2019re trying to concentrate. You need to agree though on how/when he can signal you when he does actually want to talk to you and how you can signal when you need to be completely uninterrupted (as opposed to just wanting to exclude background noise) so that he doesn\u2019t feel shut out but also you can get some interruption free periods.", "NTA per se, but you could be more understanding and I think there are ways to improve the situation for you both.\n\n1) You say you were brought up to regard any outwards vocalizations of discomfort as attention seeking, but I'd challenge you to examine why. Women are so often socialized to put others' needs ahead of their own and minimize their own hurt/distress to make the people around them comfortable, and it seems like you might be projecting this onto your fiance. It's perfectly fine to express to a loved one when you're hurting, and expecting him to limit it to 1-2 \"oofs\" or \"ouches\" seems patently unreasonable to me.\n\n2) Having said that, if his \"oofing\" is indeed as constant and distracting as you say, I think it's perfectly fair for you to feel bothered by this. My husband and I both WFH, and I'm ADHD and cant tolerate noise/interruptions like he can, and it took a lot of communication (and several come-to-Jesus talks) for me to clearly establish my boundaries & for him to accept them. Now, if I can't talk, I simply say \"I'm in the middle of something. Twenty minutes?\" or whatever timeframe I think I'll be free and he respects it and I connect with him later. So yeah, talk to him, explain why exactly his noise is so bothersome for you, and come up with a mutually beneficial solution that still shows you care (like a hand signal or phrase, agreeing to connect later when you're free/ready to talk, etc).", "INFO Why the ongoing moans and aches? It\u2019s typical that when you first start out or return to weight training there\u2019s the inevitable soreness of getting \u2018swoll\u2019.  Which is incredibly painful.\n\nWhy is it going on after more than a month? After a few weeks something\u2019s wrong beyond normal manageable soreness as muscles adapt to the routine. He\u2018s either using poor form in exercises or otherwise pushing too hard.", "NAH here. Get noise cancelling headphones, it will help you deal with the vocalizations that he needs to do, and that you apparently can't handle. Ideally, tell him you're not intending to ignore him and you're perfectly willing to interact (if that's actually the case of course), you just need some silent space to relax in if there's no need or wish for interaction on his part.", "NAH. \n\nI agree with headphones or ear buds. Maybe not even noise canceling, but something so you can listen to whatever you want and will help you stay in your zone. \n\nAlso like other commenters said, let him know that you feel concerned while he's moaning and groaning and you get distracted and feel like you can't relax, so *that* is why you'll be wearing headphones. \n\nMy partner is an info-dumper who also has lots of weird random noises (yay getting older) so I try to make sure I communicate that they need to get my attention if they have something they want to say, and if I don't have the mental hit points for info-dumping, I need to remember to mention it early in the evening. Like, \"Hey, I had a really tiring day, if you have a thing you want to talk about, can we limit the Ted talk to ten minutes?\" (Seriously I timed them once, they once talked about the latest thing they were researching for 80 minutes straight and I said nothing aside from \"oh?\" And similar one word responses.)(Also the Ted talk description is our joke but may not be appreciated elsewhere.)\n\nGood luck, I hope you are both doing okay and can find solutions!", "NAH. \nI think what you're experiencing is sensory overload. I do too.  And I especially hate when people interrupt when I read. Part of being in a relationship is rubbing off eachotjers corners and settling down into a pattern comfortable for both of you so I see nothing wrong in communicating what you feel. Just don't do it when you're already angry and snap at him because that's not going to achieve anything. When you're both in a good mood talk to him and tell him that in general when you're reading, winding down etc you'd prefer if he didn't interrupt. Maybe set some time (like an hour) for individual downtime) and sometime specific to spend with him.", "Nta. My brother moved into my house during covid and we get along well so he's staying. But he talks to himself,  he talks to the TV,  and he makes so much noise from being sore and having sinus congestion for months (yes he has seen a doctor)  its loud,  it's distracting. We finally came to an agreement that if we're in the room together and he actually needs me to respond vs is v taking to himself for him to say my name or wave to get my attention but otherwise I don't need to respond. It's still distracting but I'm not having to pull myself out of what I'm doing and he isn't having to break a life long habit of mumbling to himself. \n\nIt is easier to ignore when background noise is on... so music playing or the TV on and I can be reading in my living room and he can be talking to the TV and both are happy for the most part. And when it gets really annoying I think I get shorter with him and then he knows and tries to be conscious of doing it for a few hours", "NTA. The moaning and groaning would get old since you say he\u2019s doing it for long periods (would he be willing to take an OTC pain med?).  And the random talking, but not to you, would drive me up the wall if I was trying to concentrate.", "**INFO** I absolutely would go to another room if I could. We're currently crammed into one bedroom and a communal living room with our housemate - who recently got a puppy that stays in the living room and either whines in her crate or is all over you when she's out. I just don't have anywhere to go to relax.", "NTA, it\u2019s been so long, I think the people saying yta don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to put up with people who constantly complain.\nmy mom is the kind of person who will bump her knee or stub her toe and still complain every day for weeks or months. it\u2019s unbelievably tiring.", "NTA\n\nI'll be watching a show. My husband will randomly come into the room and start speaking to me about nothing in particular. Sometimes, he literally only pops in to kiss the top of my head then lurks. You'd think that's so cute and sweet. But it's really annoying if I'm into the show, and he has no interest in the show, so he's really just interrupting me for no good reason other than he wants to. He usually does this when he takes a \"break\" from gaming. -.-\n\nI totally get your frustration and it's not an unreasonable request to ask him to moderate this behaviour.", "NTA, people are being weirdly sensitive over this. Some people are just unnaturally noisy to the point where it's a disturbance, especially when you share a living space with them. I have this situation, and I'd recommend getting earbuds and listening to white noise on YouTube for a bit. It's always been reliable when I've needed to drown out noise that was giving me anxiety.", "NTA. \n\nIt **is** attention seeking.", "NTA that sounds annoying as fuck.", "Honey - you need some downtime away from each other to regroup and set realistic boundaries with each other. NTA for saying what you need (or don\u2019t need)\u2026..but what was your delivery? That\u2019s where you would be the best judge of whether it was too harsh.", "NAH.\n\nHonestly, if ya'll aren't already in couple's therapy, please consider starting before getting married. It can be helpful to have a more objective mediator who can teach you effective communication skills. You don't want to be dealing with this for the rest of your life.", "NAH.\n\nUsually, you should not be in pain after a workout. It's a sign you've overdone it or done something improperly. If he truly is in so much pain, I hope he figures out a better routine for his own (and your) sake.\n\nHowever, this might just be his way of trying to communicate to you that he would like to be validated. He's building up a good habit and might seek appreciation and therefore would profit from occasional encouragement. I also wondered if maybe he feels pressured to work out so you can have peace or because he is insecure. \n\nThe other option of course is, that he is bloating a bit and unnecessarily dramatic. From what I read, you seem to be on the edge a lot currently, which likely might trigger you to conclude this interpretation. Needing space and quiet is valid, I empathize a lot with you. I find when I am already stressed/unhappy, I usually have a low tolerance for things like repetitive chatter or noise and react harsher than I would if you were more relaxed and happier altogether. So try to grab the problem at the root and wind down and do something for yourself every once in a while.\n\nThere's definitely more to this and I hope the two of you can sit down, talk and find out what both of you need and solutions. I hope you can manage to get to a place where you both feel more relaxed, comfortable, and happier again.", "NTA - for a relationship to work you need good communication, if you didn\u2019t talk about it and just bottle up your feelings, your frusturation would just come out in other ways.  As long as your aren\u2019t mocking him or being unnecessarily harsh, it\u2019s important to talk to him about things that bother you.  Living with someone is a delicate balancing act.  Good luck!", "YTA\n\n> I was raised to see this kind of behavior as attention-seeking, and learned to refrain from making a bunch of racket unless it was a) involuntary/a severe injury or b) something I needed help with\n\nYeah, well, he wasn't.\n\n> This goes along with his general tendency for random outbursts and saying unrelated stuff when I'm nearby.\n\nOh god? How awful?", "NTA\n\nTell him that if he does this for minor soreness then you'll take all expressions of soreness as minor and if something is really wrong/bad you won't know it and help him\n\nAt the moment he is crying wolf where no wolf is present.", "YTA and it seems like you just kind of hate having your partner around?", "Sorry, NAH", "YTA\n\nGive it 20 more years and you'll be groaning every time you make a sudden move. You'll look back and wish you'd learned to let that shit go.", "NTA if he hurts that much after working out, he's either doing something wrong or he's doing too much or lifting too much.", "YTA, you gave me a migraine reading this. If you want a silent partner, leave him and marry a mime.", "YTA. this sounds like a you problem. You're just hyperfocused on his vocalizations and making a big deal out of nothing. He wasn't raised in your spartan household and he's not expecting you to do or say anything about it. You can ask him politely or playfully to tone it down but if this is the person you're marrying, you need to accept some things about them that might be a little annoying or inconvenient.", "YTA I would struggle to breathe around you tbh. Listen OP, don\u2019t make a mountain out of a molehill. Looking deeply into this, all your partner did was make sounds because his body was sore. There\u2019s nothing there to call him an AH about. You need to acknowledge and understand that people have been raised differently, people act differently and that they won\u2019t always accommodate to others needs.\n\nYes, you\u2019ve told him before and it can be slightly irritating but there\u2019s nothing harmful or malicious about it and your reaction seemed a little over the top.

I disagree with the general premise of your upbringing that \u201cattention seeking\u201d is bad, especially from one\u2019s partner. Being a newbie to a serious workout routine is a big adjustment, your body is always sore in places you didn\u2019t know existed, and it is a reminder of your achievements. I don\u2019t think you can really ask him not to vocalize it out loud to himself in his own home. It might come across as being unsupportive. \n\nParagraph 2- have you been tested for ADD? This is exactly what it feels like. \n\nMaybe there are ways that you could have more structured alone time? It\u2019s important to be able to express when you need alone time. Maybe you could develop some signals for when you need it, and tell him that these are cues (such as when you are reading a book, or going to another room) that you aren\u2019t available for conversation. Maybe those seem like obvious cues to you and I, but there is no harm in communicating it directly.", "YTA - you know how you just can't ignore him and you have trouble refocusing? It may be equally as hard for him not to vocalize pain or talk to himself. The way your brain works and what you need are not automatically what everyone should adjust to. Wear headphones.", "Sounds like he\u2019s a drama Queen but then being honest you don\u2019t sound much better to me . Sort it out between yourselves without the need for all the attention him from you and you from social media AKA the world", "Well it seems to me that this is actually a YOU problem. You think every noise has something to do with you. You think unless someone is dying or need assistance should be quiet and your fragile concentration is easily disturbed. Again, a you problem. I get that someone can be a drama lama and exaggerate but you have made this issue into something extremely more serious that waht is already be. Also getting annoyed so easily is not most of the times the reason, but just a symptom YTA", "why are you dating this guy?...apparently everything but his breathing annoys you.", "The logical solution here seems to be noise-canceling headphones or going in another room and shutting the door when you are having focus time.

While it may just be how he grew up to vocalize his internal thoughts & reactions, so long as you've asked kindly & directly for for him to tone it back he should. But a point to consider is if he is actually that sore after the gym every time, he's not taking care of himself. Workouts should push you but he's probably not doing any post workout cool down, stretching, foam rolling. I know I'm super lucky to have a gym with a pool & hot tub, so my husband and I always finish our routines with cold pool/hot tub/cold pool and it really allows your muscles to move into recovery properly.

You can also tell those who have never dealt with any kind of sensitivity to sound or been close to someone with them.\n\nAlso, as someone with chronic pain, I'll be the first to say that there are always gonna be those legitimate times when you can't control yourself bc the pain comes out of nowhere for whatever reason. However, if you're sore from exercising, yeah, it definitely hurts.. but it's not like it's gonna be a surprise each and every time. You know it's coming, so brace yourself and keep on trucking. In my case, I do my best to go the other way and try to make as little pain related noise as possible bc 1) I don't want my loved ones to feel bad. I'm always hurting, and there's nothing they can do about it. Constantly making it known does nothing but bring down the general vibe in every situation, 2) when people are subjected to the same noise all the time, it starts to lose its meaning so they tune it out and actually stop hearing you for real. You're not being ignored, you've just been relegated to background noise by that point and then, when it's a noise that *shouldn't* be ignored, they won't know bc they've heard it 100 times that day already, and 3) we're all human. Hearing the same thing over and over is gonna get annoying no matter how much of a compassionate person you are. Hell, even I'd get annoyed by my *own* voice if I spent the whole day groaning each time I moved a muscle. \n\nHopefully OP, you and he can have a sit down and talk it out. Maybe he feels like he's not getting something from you. Maybe he wants extra compassion or possibly even some validation for how hard he's working?? Could it be that he thinks that by being so vocal, he's conveying how much it hurts, and he wants you to tell him you're proud of him for working so hard.. or something akin to that?? Idk, I feel like if it were my kids doing this, these would be the types of questions I would ask them. Good luck, hope you get some peace and quiet soon!", "Also I think that OP just needs to explain what\u2019s been explained here regarding the way she was raised.

If you\u2019ve just told him it bothers you, and that it interrupts you\u2019re functioning when he has these outbursts, but not specifically *why*, then I would say NAH.

Adding some kind of yoga or pilates at the end of the session is a good way to ease the body, it helps for the soreness (also, sauna or very hot shower). It is really a game changer. \n\nBut about the training, the most important is that it should be leveled : some training should be recurrent (same amount, same time) until the exercise is accomplished without difficulties or excessive soreness after. Just when your body fully adapted, meaning being able to do it without suffering after, then you try to reach the next goal.\n\nThis consistency help in the short and long term, especially in case of accident or sickness that prevent from exercising, the body loose less muscles and strengths and return to his performance in an easier and quicker way.", "Sometimes people want time to themselves.
