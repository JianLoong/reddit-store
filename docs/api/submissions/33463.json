Not picking him up makes you seem like the AH. However, HIS flight got changed to come in 2 hours later. Not under your control.  If this was during the day time I'd call you the AH but considering how late and far it is and given the fact he can easily pay for this...NTA", "NAH. I get it, 2am is super late and if you\u2019re tired it wouldn\u2019t be safe to drive, but your brother isn\u2019t an ass either for being upset that you decided not to help after all.", "NTA. It's up to you to decide if you feel safe driving late at night, and it sounds like there are plenty of viable alternatives available.", "NTA. What does he expect you to do, stay up all night? Flight delayed until 2:10 means you\u2019re not getting home until 3:00 at the earliest. What if there is another delay? We all know how great the airlines are at keeping to their schedules", "NAH. This is a sucky part of travel. Planes get delayed and plans change. If you're not comfortable driving at that time then it's safer you don't anyway.\n\nBut I can understand his disappointment of not seeing family straight away, so I don't think he is an AH either - so long as he doesn't press the point anymore now. He's allowed to be disappointed but not to the extent that would make you feel like you've done the wrong thing. If he pushes back anymore - he's crossed a line!", "Ehhh idk. My biggest concern here is the logistics of getting an Uber at that hour. Of course if you\u2019re in a big city it\u2019s probably not too difficult but in smaller cities it can be difficult to get an Uber at 2am on a week night, especially going outside the city. If getting an Uber is going to prove to be challenging I\u2019d say yta, you made the commit to already pick him at midnight, with no real excuse I\u2019d say it\u2019s reasonable to expect you to still go at 2. If Ubers are no issue and reliable in your area I\u2019d say NAH, reasonable accommodation but I get it being annoying having to get in a strangers car at that late of an hour when you were expecting your brother.", "NTA.  I wouldn't be safe to drive that late at night; so I can totally understand leaving it to someone who is more awake.", "Slight YTA, I know 2 am is pretty late, but he's the one who's still traveling. Getting a cab at midnight sucks, but at 2am is even worse. You just made what was a long and crappy day of travel even worse. You bailed on him because it got inconvenient for you.", "NTA.\n\nIf I was your brother I would\u2019ve asked you myself not to bother coming because my flight was delayed.", "NTA most people are so tired by 2am that it really is unsafe for them to be behind the wheel", "Your brother didn't plan to be that late. He's probably more upset than you are.\n\nI flew back form the UK to NYC one year. the flight was to arrive at 7 pm. a friend working in queens and was going to get dinner after work and pick me up. The plane was delayed and didn't get in until 2 am.-this was precell phone days and I'd called-on a pay phone- to a mutual friend in NY and left a message warning the friend .\n\nI didn't expect him to be there. I figured I 'd have to figure a way to get back home. but he showed up. 2 am and he was there. he went home, went to bed, then got up in the middle of the night to help a friend. not even a brother.  \n\nand yet you couldn't do that because you don't feel like it?\n\nlet's make it official YTA", "If he makes enough money\nNTA", "NAH, I get both points of view", "I mean it is not great to back out in general without good reason.    \nAs long as you are okay if the roles were switched. And probably expect the same courtesy might happen to you if a similar scenario comes up.", "No more TA than he is for asking you to still collect him at that ungodly hour.\n\nIn an ideal world, both of you would prioritise the other's feelings. Call it reverse horse trading.\n\nHe might have started \"my flight is delayed until 2.10, don't come out, I'll get a Uber\". You might have replied \"it's OK, I'll still come and get you\". Him: \"but it's so late, you should be sleeping\". You: \"that's ok, I dont have to work the next day\"... etc etc\n\nSee who blinks first \"well, if you're sure...\"\n\nThis volley can last between 5 and 20 shots depending on the situation.\n\nFWIW in our family I feel this would end with an Uber, and rightly so IMHO. Final judgement: If you offer to pay for the Uber then NTA. Although this too might trigger another round of reverse horse trading.", "YTA. You said you'd get your brother from the airport. You know that flights get delayed. If you had said, \"I'll pick you up at midnight, but if your flight's delayed you have to take an Uber,\" it would be different. But you committed to pick him up from the airport, any you should have done it, either by getting him or paying forc the Uber yourself.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nIt is family. Yes, they can be an inconvenience, bothersome at times, but it is always nice to get off a plane and see your family waiting for you or excited to see you.\n\nI don't think its about the money but an Uber is a waste of money.", "YTA\n\nYou don't have to work. You just don't feel like picking him up 2 hours later. That's just lazy. You should at least pay for his Uber.", "I get it. But I\u2019m giving you a soft YTA. You agreed to pick him up, planes get delayed alllllll the time. If it were me personally, I would\u2019ve planned on the plane landing well after the initial arrive time and planned my evening accordingly, like taking a nap. I\u2019m not going to say \u201che\u2019s your brother,\u201d but you made a commitment and then didn\u2019t stick to it because you just didn\u2019t want to be up that late. I don\u2019t know, I was just taught that when you agree to do something like pick someone up at the airport, you do so, regardless of flight delays (unless there really is a scheduling conflict which you stated there is not). It\u2019s not your fault his flight was delayed, but it\u2019s also not his, and you let him down.", "YTA. \n\nThere will be a time in the future that you will also need him and he will then be influenced by your decision probably. If you had work tomorrow or another place to be, it would've been understandable but as you don't it just seems like laziness or uninterest.", "YTA.  You had no big reason, and he is coming to see you.  But, he also is one for not preemptively offering to Uber given the hour.", "YTA. It's your brother. It's just you being lazy and selfish.", "YTA. He\u2019s your brother at the end of the day. If you don\u2019t have anything planned for the next morning then why wouldn\u2019t you help him out?", "YTA, you agreed to pick him up, you let him down.  It\u2019s not the money.", "YTA. It\u2019s your brother. One late night to help your brother won\u2019t kill you.", "Jesus... YTA... are you serious?  Set an alarm.", "NTA\n\nFlight got changed hours later, he\u2019s not hard up for cash, you let him know.\n\nShit happens. He needs to suck it up.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nYTA if you renegged and the original flights were still the same and you didn't give enough notice, but flights have been delayed, instead of a slight convenience chances are it's now out of your way, sleep deprivation etc. you've offered alternative solutions and given plenty of heads up.", "NTA. I get that flight times are not always convenient and the person flying needs to pick the times/dates that work best. That being said, it is almost 100% inevitable that a flight arriving at midnight will not arrive on time. Take the 6 am flight the next day, arrive at a reasonable time and have cushion for delays. That's just my flying philosophy tho...", "YTA\n\nYou made a commitment, and then cause it was a little more inconvenient, you just texted him and bailed. AH move.", "YTA. You said you\u2019d do something you should stick to it. Midnight and 2 am are both in the \u201cyou get your own ride\u201d time zone for me, but if you agreed you should follow thru. Agreeing to pick someone up from the airport doesn\u2019t usually come with the \u201cunless your flight is delayed\u201d caveat.", "NTA. You agreed to pick him up at midnight. There's a certain hour at which people have to understand their timing has lapsed from \"People can work with you on this\" to \"I need to figure this out myself because it's at a time when it is a terrible inconvenience, if outright not possible\". Asking someone to pick you up after you *land* at 2:10 (and while I don't know your airport, the two closest to me that will mean \"maybe walking out of the airport at 2:30, if you're lucky\" - odds are worse if there's a checked bag) is too much.\n\nYou agreed to midnight. You didn't agree to 2-something AM.", "NTA -- expecting you to stay up that late is an unreasonable expectation on his part.", "[deleted]", "YTA", "Yeah, you're an asshole. It's not his fault the flight was delayed, and you said you didn't have to work.... It's your brother. Let me re emphasize, YTA!", "NTA. Not your travel plans? Not up to you to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Traveling anywhere requires accommodating for hiccups with delayed flights, lost luggage, missed rides, etc. It's up to the traveler to figure out new arrangements if the first plan falls through. Personally, I wouldn't even ask my family to come get me because that is pretty late. I would text them all my Lyft info and let them know when I've arrived safely. But also, in my family we bend over backwards for one another. I bet $1000 bucks any of my siblings would pick me up at 2am no problem and I'd do the same. We all got that unhealthy sleep schedule going in our favor \ud83d\ude05", "NTA being out driving around at 2 am when you're not used to being up that late is just begging to get into an accident.", "INFO. What was the original time the flight was due?", "NTA. His flight changed, it\u2019s not like you bailed on the original pickup time.", "eh idk me personally I'm going to pick my brother up! I set an alarm catch some Zs and go. however I understand not want to drive that late at night. it's not ur fault his flight got delayed but it's not his fault either\n\nNTA I guess... maybe lol idk", "ESH. Flights get delayed frequently. You should have told him off the bat that you wouldn't pick him up if his flight is delayed. He sucks for the same reason: deal with predictable things ahead of time.", "For my brother or a friend, I can still Reddit and Instagram for two) 2) hours while I wait. It's just not that big of a deal to me. Are you not that close with your brother that you'd do this for him? Did you not think this through before ditching him? Didn't think he might be upset that he's now having to deal with an Uber instead of a ride with his bro? Didn't think that it may affect the mood for everyone in the house for the entire holiday? Sometimes we think beyond ourselves and make sacrifices for others. Butterfly effect dude.", "YTA: You made the commitment. You're counting on him being able to find an Uber at that time of night? I don't know if I would trust anyone driving around at that time of night if they weren't a friend or relative. I think it's a jerk move- flights get delayed. Everyone knows this. You still committed.", "Really? You have nothing to stop you picking him up except you don't  want to miss some sleep? Family and friends should help each other when needed. Only 35 minutes away? Pick him up, bring him home and go back to bed. You miss an hour and a half sleep for your brother? That's being there for him. Make him take an Uber? Sure, he could but I would rather have family pick me rather than a stranger. I don't  think your an AH but don't realize this would hurt his feelings (many men cover hurt feelings with anger). Family should be able to count on one another- why can't  you? Just sleep in that hour and a half?", "I\u2019d pick up my wife, kids, or mother at 2AM, but no one else. NAH, your brother will be fine.", "YTA. You made a commitment and really, what is an extra 2 hours when you're not working in the morning? I would never bail on someone over a 2 hour wait.", "Maybe unpopular opinion, but YTA. Depending on where you live, uber is next to impossible to get at 3am (which, realistically is when he would likely be able to get out of the terminal). Not only that, but you're springing this on him as he's traveling, giving him no chance to contact someone else for a guaranteed ride. If you had an emergency, or a medical condition that prevented you from driving at night then it would be different. But \"I don't feel like it\" isn't a good reason to screw someone over. Especially not someone you care about. You're being selfish and going back on a promise, when it would cost you nothing to keep your word. Your brother will remember this, and maybe the next time you need a favor from him he \"won't feel like it\" as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
