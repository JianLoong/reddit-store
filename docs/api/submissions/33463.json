It's up to you to decide if you feel safe driving late at night, and it sounds like there are plenty of viable alternatives available.", "NTA. What does he expect you to do, stay up all night? Flight delayed until 2:10 means you\u2019re not getting home until 3:00 at the earliest. What if there is another delay? We all know how great the airlines are at keeping to their schedules", "NAH.

My biggest concern here is the logistics of getting an Uber at that hour. Of course if you\u2019re in a big city it\u2019s probably not too difficult but in smaller cities it can be difficult to get an Uber at 2am on a week night, especially going outside the city. If getting an Uber is going to prove to be challenging I\u2019d say yta, you made the commit to already pick him at midnight, with no real excuse I\u2019d say it\u2019s reasonable to expect you to still go at 2. If Ubers are no issue and reliable in your area I\u2019d say NAH, reasonable accommodation but I get it being annoying having to get in a strangers car at that late of an hour when you were expecting your brother.", "NTA.  I wouldn't be safe to drive that late at night; so I can totally understand leaving it to someone who is more awake.", "Slight YTA, I know 2 am is pretty late, but he's the one who's still traveling.

You just don't feel like picking him up 2 hours later. That's just lazy. You should at least pay for his Uber.", "I get it. But I\u2019m giving you a soft YTA. You agreed to pick him up, planes get delayed alllllll the time.

I don\u2019t know, I was just taught that when you agree to do something like pick someone up at the airport, you do so, regardless of flight delays (unless there really is a scheduling conflict which you stated there is not). It\u2019s not your fault his flight was delayed, but it\u2019s also not his, and you let him down.", "YTA. \n\nThere will be a time in the future that you will also need him and he will then be influenced by your decision probably. If you had work tomorrow or another place to be, it would've been understandable but as you don't it just seems like laziness or uninterest.", "YTA.  You had no big reason, and he is coming to see you.  But, he also is one for not preemptively offering to Uber given the hour.", "YTA. It's your brother. It's just you being lazy and selfish.", "YTA.

I get that flight times are not always convenient and the person flying needs to pick the times/dates that work best. That being said, it is almost 100% inevitable that a flight arriving at midnight will not arrive on time. Take the 6 am flight the next day, arrive at a reasonable time and have cushion for delays. That's just my flying philosophy tho...", "YTA\n\nYou made a commitment, and then cause it was a little more inconvenient, you just texted him and bailed. AH move.", "YTA. You said you\u2019d do something you should stick to it. Midnight and 2 am are both in the \u201cyou get your own ride\u201d time zone for me, but if you agreed you should follow thru.

There's a certain hour at which people have to understand their timing has lapsed from \"People can work with you on this\" to \"I need to figure this out myself because it's at a time when it is a terrible inconvenience, if outright not possible\". Asking someone to pick you up after you *land* at 2:10 (and while I don't know your airport, the two closest to me that will mean \"maybe walking out of the airport at 2:30, if you're lucky\" - odds are worse if there's a checked bag) is too much.\n\nYou agreed to midnight.

Not up to you to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Traveling anywhere requires accommodating for hiccups with delayed flights, lost luggage, missed rides, etc. It's up to the traveler to figure out new arrangements if the first plan falls through. Personally, I wouldn't even ask my family to come get me because that is pretty late. I would text them all my Lyft info and let them know when I've arrived safely. But also, in my family we bend over backwards for one another. I bet $1000 bucks any of my siblings would pick me up at 2am no problem and I'd do the same.

Didn't think he might be upset that he's now having to deal with an Uber instead of a ride with his bro? Didn't think that it may affect the mood for everyone in the house for the entire holiday? Sometimes we think beyond ourselves and make sacrifices for others. Butterfly effect dude.", "YTA: You made the commitment. You're counting on him being able to find an Uber at that time of night? I don't know if I would trust anyone driving around at that time of night if they weren't a friend or relative. I think it's a jerk move- flights get delayed. Everyone knows this. You still committed.", "Really? You have nothing to stop you picking him up except you don't  want to miss some sleep? Family and friends should help each other when needed. Only 35 minutes away? Pick him up, bring him home and go back to bed. You miss an hour and a half sleep for your brother? That's being there for him. Make him take an Uber? Sure, he could but I would rather have family pick me rather than a stranger. I don't  think your an AH but don't realize this would hurt his feelings (many men cover hurt feelings with anger). Family should be able to count on one another- why can't  you? Just sleep in that hour and a half?", "I\u2019d pick up my wife, kids, or mother at 2AM, but no one else. NAH, your brother will be fine.", "YTA. You made a commitment and really, what is an extra 2 hours when you're not working in the morning? I would never bail on someone over a 2 hour wait.", "Maybe unpopular opinion, but YTA. Depending on where you live, uber is next to impossible to get at 3am (which, realistically is when he would likely be able to get out of the terminal). Not only that, but you're springing this on him as he's traveling, giving him no chance to contact someone else for a guaranteed ride. If you had an emergency, or a medical condition that prevented you from driving at night then it would be different. But \"I don't feel like it\" isn't a good reason to screw someone over. Especially not someone you care about. You're being selfish and going back on a promise, when it would cost you nothing to keep your word. Your brother will remember this, and maybe the next time you need a favor from him he \"won't feel like it\" as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
