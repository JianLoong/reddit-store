It was his mistake - yeah, that really sucks, but why should your niece go without? If he says you \u2018hurt his brother\u2019, why would his brother know about this gift? If he told him in advance, he should have been more careful. If he expressly told him, \u2018You can\u2019t have the drone because OP wouldn\u2019t take the charger away from his niece who\u2019s a girl who has no right to it,\u2019 he\u2019s a major asshole who used a child to blackmail you, and a misogynist who ensured his brother grows up the same way.", "NtA.  You didnt hurt his little brother, he did.  You were kind enough to transport the gift for him,. But he is out of line to expect you to ruin your niece's Christmas gift because of HIS carelessness.  If he had left the drone packed up he wouldnt have forgotten the charger", "NTA. Your friend messed up and still wants to blame it on you months later. Insane. And misogynistic.", "NTA bruh they need to learn what online shopping is", "NTA I don't see how you owed him your niece's charger. He's the one who forgot it, so why should your niece suffer? Because she's a girl and can therefore not enjoy technology? What an incredibly sexist view.", "NTA. A lack of prep on his end, does not constitute an emergency on you or your nieces. She shouldn't have to make some kind of sacrifice, just because of his mistake. Why should she do without, so his brother can have?", "NTA and honestly I think you were the opposite of disloyal. Your friend screwed up and that\u2019s on him. He could have shipped the charger to his brother. Just because he is a misogynist and thinks girls can\u2019t like drones doesn\u2019t mean you are automatically required to ruin your gift to your niece. He sounds like a turd.", "NTA\n\nHe forgot to pack the charger. The fact that he said that your nice won't care for a drone sounds sexist, but that's beyond the subject here. \n\nIf he wants to bring that up, you can respond to his poor memory to gifts.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat an AH HE is.", "NTA.
