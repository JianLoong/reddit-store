You tried the private route. They ignored it. He's a grown ass man who is peeing everywhere and not cleaning up after himself. Toddlers have better self control and responsibility. Disgusting. He didn't even clean up after himself after you called him out - his wife went in to do it. He deserves to feel ashamed.", "NTA\n\n(Though you owe your son a sundae)\n\nYou've spoken to Man-Bear-Pig before about his projectile inaccuracy.  And if he can't take a second to remember the old adage, \"If you sprinkle when you tinkle please be neat and wipe the seat\", (among other things) then he deserves the bell!  SHAME!  SHAME!", "NTA\n\nA grown adult who doesn't clean his mess in the bathroom deserves to be publicly humiliated. And notice how BIL didn't go to clean after himself, your sister did.", "NTA  \n\n\nReally, I'd stop inviting them. Several of my son's friends during middle school became not-welcome at my house because they apparently had no idea how to use the toilet or clean up after themselves.", "> if an adult cannot piss properly or clean up after themselves perhaps they should be embarrassed.\n\n100% true. NTA. \n\nINFO: Why even have them over? Anyone who pisses all over the toilet and doesn't clean it up wouldn't be welcome at my house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My sister's husband is a pig.\n\nAlso true, and probably an understatment.", "NTA. Humiliate him until he can act like an adult. NEVER say sorry to a person that literally pissed all over your home.", "NTA and you owe no apology. If that fat slob can't pee without fouling up every bathroom, he needs to sit down to pee or practice.", "If you've already talked with them privately about the issue and it's still going on, definitely NTA. It's basic hygene and human descency to not leave your own piss all over someone else's toilet. You may go ahead and apologize anyways, because this incident may have impacted the BIL and he might clean things up in the future.", " Nta, I don\u2019t want to clean up someone else\u2019s bodily fluids. He should not be embarrassed, nobody should have found out. He should have looked at the toilet and said to himself nobody has pissed on the seat or the floor, after he made a mess he should have cleaned it. He is an asshole.", "Since you've talked about it before to them in private, and nothing changed, I'd say NTA. That's disgusting, and your bil needed a reality check one way or another. The one thing I have an issue with is involving your son in the situation without any warning", "I think you owe an apology to your son. I would be mortified if someone falsely accused me of something like that one on one much less in front of a group of people. Your son should never have been a part of this. You could have just as easily confronted your BIL without mentioning your son at all.", "NTA. You've already tried speaking to them in private. They gave no indication that your BIL has any sort of disability that prevents him from cleaning up after himself. Sounds to me like your BIL owed *you* an apology for subjecting you to such a nauseating mess.\n\nMaybe put a stack of paper towels and a waste can in the bathroom when (if) they visit again. Along with a sign that says \"If you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be neat and wipe the seat.\"", "No and NTA\n\nI agree with others that have said they just wouldn't invite him anymore. It's basic hygiene, and to behave like that in someone else's house is truly disgusting. If you wanted to apologize, you could tell them you're sorry for embarrassing him, but since you know it WILL happen again, and you WILL say something, embarrassing him again, it's easier to just not invite them anymore.", "NTA.   \nNo apology required. This is a family dinner\u2026 everyone in this family has been cleaning up after him for \u2026 years? Gross.   \nNext time he comes over leave a spray bottle of cleaner and a cloth on the cistern ready for him to do it himself.", "Why would you owe him an apology for embarrassing him when you were pretending you thought it was your son with the poor behaviour. He should be ashamed and embarrassed of HIMSELF not embarrassed because of you\n\nAlso. How is it that your sister went in there to clean up. Why didn\u2019t he get off his ass and clean it up himself. He should be embarrassed for the piss AND the fact his mommy/wife had to go clean up after his disgusting self", "NTA - and ask your sister what are you supposed to do going forward? Ban him from your house, summon her everytime he pees as you\u2019ve tried to ask him politely and privately.\n\nSo at this point, he should be embarrassed heartily, because he\u2019s a pig who doesn\u2019t care as she\u2019ll just clean up after him AND she should be embarrassed to bring him places when he does it to her family\u2019s homes.", "NTA but you owe your son an apology and an explanation. You weaponized and embarrassed him knowingly and publicly in order to shame your disgusting BIL. He didn't agree to that. You don't mention his age but you need to come up with an age-appropriate explanation asap, and possibly a gift to emphasize the apology. And praise his potty habits consistently for a while so he doesn't get confused by the mixed message you just sent. \n\nYour BIL has every right to be embarrassed. I'm concerned that your sister immediately cleaned up the mess like it's her fault. Maybe meek is her personality but keep an eye out for domestic abuse. She sounds like she has all the confidence of a doormat and might need some help.", "NTA. Your sister went to clean up his piss??? Wow.", "NTA but why in the fuck is the wife going in to clean it up? Idve blocked the bathroom door and told her, no, your HUSBAND made the mess, HE can clean it up. Needless to say, I don\u2019t get asked to throw parties or gatherings at my house\u2026 I say what I say in mine, but hold my tongue at others\u2019 houses.", "ESH - on your side, just because you didn't warn your son ahead of time and as far as we know you didn't apologize to him afterwards.  I hope you apologized to him in public and again after the relatives left.   Let him know that you appreciate his grownup courtesy, and admit that you knew it wasn't him.  \n\nYou do not owe your BIL an apology.", "NTA. That's fing gross!!  Good for you & your family for teaching your son.", "NTA and I love this. You KNEW how your son would respond. You know your kid and know if this would embarrass him or not. It didn\u2019t but did rightfully embarrass the proper party. As you\u2019ve tried to deal with the situation privately in the past with no result I think you handled this wonderfully.", "NTA and you don't owe him an apology.", "NTA! But your BIL is disgusting and disrespectful! And your sister is a disgusting enabler \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22 I would never clean up piss after my man I don\u2019t even do it for my 6 yr old nephew as I just remind him to clean up after his mishaps", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nAnd you're right, your brother-in-law is a complete pig. If you know (and how can he NOT know?) that you wanker isn't capable of a clean stream, then sit the hell down and piss. And if you make a mess, clean it up. What kind of animal does that to someone else's house, let alone their own? If someone did this at my place, male or female, they'd be banned from using the bathroom. Take it outside you sloppy pisser!", "I definitely wouldn't have said it to my son. I don't know why you didn't say it to the BIL.", "NTA... well done", "NTA. Unless your BIL is severely on the spectrum he should be cleaning up after himself (and should get his piss in the toilet unless he's over 400 pounds, it's not his wife's responsibility to clean up after him).", "NTA - and you were MUCH nicer than I was. Dead Husband (DH) had a friend come over and pissed all over the toilet and the rug. I. Stepped. In. Piss. Barefoot! I went outside to where they were sitting and told DH it was time for his friend to go home and that he wasn\u2019t allowed back over until he was housebroken.", "NTA but I would not invite them over again because he's gonna pee somewhere intentionally. \n\nOr if you do, maybe get pet pee pads and put them ALL around the guest toilet", "NTA and the apology needs to come from them, not you.", "My grandma had a poem hanging above the toilet\n\nIf you sprinkle \n\n\nWhen you tinkle\n\n\nBe a sweetie\n\n\nWipe the seatie", "Publicly ban his from the house for this shit. \"BIL isn't welcome in my home until my sister succesfully potty trains him or he learns how to clean up after himself.\"\n\nMaybe public shame for wrecking the bathroom and being too lazy to clean it up will get through to them. If not, at least you won't be dealing with it either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "YTA only cause you did that to your son; unless he was in on it, you owe him an apology. Your BIL deserves to be embarrassed.", "ROFL!  You, OP, are awesome.  So not the AH!!!!!\n\nAlso, take your son out for ice-cream and thank him for his help and apologise for embarrassing him.  Tell him it won't happen again.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you told your son that you were sorry. That\u2019s so gross and why did your sister clean up after your BIL?! He should\u2019ve done it.", "Buy a litter box and tell your BIL he can use it next time. Or leave puppy pads all over. NTA (well, maybe 10% for involving your son)", "No apology necessary.  He deserved that.  In the future pay attention and when he heads to the bathroom ask his wife to go with him to do her job cleaning up after him in the bathroom.  He could sit, he has to sit to shit, he can sit to pee and not have a mess to clean up or be embarrassed.  Good for you, that was a fantastic way to embarrass him and good for your son for speaking up!", "No apology necessary, to your BIL. You talked to them about it before. \nThat was embarrassing for your son, that is a horrible way to treat your son.", "This was a hilarious way to call him out ngl. No you do not owe him an apology, he owes you an apology for making a gross mess and expecting a woman to clean it up. He does deserve to be called out as even children know to either clean up or get someone to help.\n\nYour son however, didn't deserve to be called out in front of everyone and I would suggest you do apologize to him. \n\nTalk to your sister. Tell her that she shouldn't be cleaning up after him and ASK her to share her feelings about it. I'm sure that she's frustrated and could do with some support. Let her know that she's not responsible for this and she should not have to deal with it. Give her a safe space to talk and tell her you love her and don't want her to have to live with so little respect. \n\nYou didn't call him out directly and he did the wrong thing so you don't owe him anything, but your sister needs help because this is not normal or OK. Even if he has some kind of medical issue, that doesn't prevent him from cleaning up and he should just sit down if he can't control it. I would continue to call him out by calmly asking if he will go clean up the bathroom, not in front of others, every single time he does it. \n\nWhat you did was mad ballsy but not really a way to work through anything maturely. If you want you could speak to him and say sorry he felt called out but why didn't he clean up after himself? He'll probably say he doesn't realize but you know that's not true so I'd press on. He owes an apology to your son too really, but he probably won't offer one!", "NTA\n\nAt first, I thought you were T A for not giving your son a heads up, but since he's so young, good for you. \n\nI mean, it feels maybe like it was a little humiliating for your son, but if I'm being honest, I don't have kids, so I don't really know.\n\nWhat I do know is you don't owe your BIL an apology. Has he ever apologized for making you clean up his bodily fluids? More than once?\n\nGross", "ESH; the BIL for obvious reasons but you because you yelled at your son about something he didn't do (and that is embarrassing), and could have put him in the middle of a fight between you and the BIL--> for example, if BIL denied it and said it actually was son, or got mad at son.   \n\nIf you wanted to confront BIL in front of everyone, you could and should have just done that rather than playing a little passive-aggressive game that involved accusing your son of something gross you knew he didn't do.", "YTA. Not for how you treated your brother in law but for how you treated your son. Don't use your kids as pawns in your conflicts. You probably embarrassed him just as much as you did your brother in law.", "NTA.  You apologized to your son, as you should have. As to your BiL, You are the one owed an apology by the adult who left a mess in your bathroom.", "NTA a grown man who either doesn\u2019t notice or thinks he is above cleaning up after himself when he is a guest deserves public shaming.  I have a feeling your son will fully appreciate the story when her is older and his future wife will be most appreciative.  \n\nAs far as your sister - she needs to make her husband clean up after himself and hit the target.  He embarrassed himself with the behavior. He publicly embarrassed himself with his behavior because privately speaking about it did not get the message across.  If your houseguest acts like a pig, it is fair to name the pig.", "ESH, but you not to your BIL, only to your son. You potentially really embarrassed him and this was not his problem. \n\nYour BIL is absolutely the AH.

Apology doesn't change that.\n\nYou're an adult, so behave like one. Instead of playing manipulative games, just address the issue directly. If you're uncomfortable talking to your BIL then talk to your sister.\n\nYou should've never involved your son. Your BIL sucks and there's no reason to put up with that. Just ask them to leave and stop inviting them over and let them know exactly why. You don't have to subject your house to your BIL's bodily fluids.", "I think it was extremely unwise and unkind to humiliate your son in public like that. Even though you apologized, now he knows that you're willing to do that to him.

I don't own a dick so I don't know how good I'd be at pissing with one, but it's basic human decency to clean up after yourself. But your poor kid must have been mortified!

I'm just commenting on my opinion on them.", "If OP had gone straight for BIL in front of everyone, they'd call OP an AH and the BIL would get away with it again.\n\nThis was actually pretty clever to \"accidentally\" call him out so the family can't take BIL's side.\n\nI agree, it sucks for the kid to be involved, but it was only for a moment and OP can make it up to him.\n\nOverall, NTA", "I don\u2019t think that needed to be a private convo - sure she shouldn\u2019t have drug her son into it but BIL should be publicly shamed", "Even an expensive game isn't really enough to make up for humiliating your child in front of their entire family, especially when she could have easily asked her son for his permission to do this beforehand. \n\nI hate it when parents use their children as a means to an end at the expense of the child's well-being.\n\nMost Switch games, especially the kind that 4-year-olds would play (I assume she's not buying him a FPS) are in the $20-50 range, which isn't what I would consider expensive. I spend more than that on a lunch for a single person (to be fair, it includes appetizers and cocktails) at a restaurant classified as $$ on Yelp. \n\nThe amount of money put into compensating for intentionally humiliating your child in front of their family to get back at another adult, especially when you could have easily asked him for permission but didn't should be significantly more than what a nice dinner for one person costs.\n\nNow maybe OP is in a difficult financial situation, in which case she should buy him, say, a new game every month for a year, if she doesn't have hundreds of dollars of disposable income at the moment.\n\nBut what she did to her child was bad enough, in my opinion, that he should be compensated handsomely.", "She said he's four.", "It doesn\u2019t say in the post (at least that I saw). Regardless of the age, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable to embarrass your kid to prove a point to someone else. OP could have come out of the bathroom and said, hey go clean up your mess you disgusting asshole to BIL. YMMV.", "Stay classy OP, you're the one that posted on AITA.\n\nI agree with the above, shaming your kid (regardless of their age) to prove a point to your disgusting BIL isn't cool.", "So just be shitty to her own kid? Who has nothing to do with it?\n\nAny other parenting advice? Should she hit her kid when she's mad at her boss?", "Sure, and BIL is never gonna do it again. Despite her directly confronting him and nothing changing.", "Thank you Scientist :)\n\nThere you go, an appropriate response for a 4 year old.", "Yeah she could have but I imagine this stung BIL a little more.\n\nChild still young he still pees sitting down and the tone used to explain how she apologised also dictates this. \n\nI don't think it's that big of a deal, she apologised and son probably doesn't care.", "Except I didn\u2019t say anything about her kid\u2026  I only spoke to your accusation of OP not confronting BIL directly like an adult.  You seem to have an issue jumping to your own conclusions.", "Except her kid is what my whole comment is about. I block people who can't read, bye."]}
