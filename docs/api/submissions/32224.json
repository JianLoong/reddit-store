You tried the private route. They ignored it. He's a grown ass man who is peeing everywhere and not cleaning up after himself. Toddlers have better self control and responsibility. Disgusting. He didn't even clean up after himself after you called him out - his wife went in to do it. He deserves to feel ashamed.", "NTA\n\n(Though you owe your son a sundae)\n\nYou've spoken to Man-Bear-Pig before about his projectile inaccuracy.  And if he can't take a second to remember the old adage, \"If you sprinkle when you tinkle please be neat and wipe the seat\", (among other things) then he deserves the bell!  SHAME!  SHAME!", "NTA\n\nA grown adult who doesn't clean his mess in the bathroom deserves to be publicly humiliated. And notice how BIL didn't go to clean after himself, your sister did.", "NTA  \n\n\nReally, I'd stop inviting them. Several of my son's friends during middle school became not-welcome at my house because they apparently had no idea how to use the toilet or clean up after themselves.", "> if an adult cannot piss properly or clean up after themselves perhaps they should be embarrassed.\n\n100% true. NTA. \n\nINFO: Why even have them over? Anyone who pisses all over the toilet and doesn't clean it up wouldn't be welcome at my house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My sister's husband is a pig.\n\nAlso true, and probably an understatment.", "NTA. Humiliate him until he can act like an adult. NEVER say sorry to a person that literally pissed all over your home.", "[removed]", "If you've already talked with them privately about the issue and it's still going on, definitely NTA. It's basic hygene and human descency to not leave your own piss all over someone else's toilet. You may go ahead and apologize anyways, because this incident may have impacted the BIL and he might clean things up in the future.", " Nta, I don\u2019t want to clean up someone else\u2019s bodily fluids. He should not be embarrassed, nobody should have found out. He should have looked at the toilet and said to himself nobody has pissed on the seat or the floor, after he made a mess he should have cleaned it. He is an asshole.", "Since you've talked about it before to them in private, and nothing changed, I'd say NTA. That's disgusting, and your bil needed a reality check one way or another. The one thing I have an issue with is involving your son in the situation without any warning", "I think you owe an apology to your son. I would be mortified if someone falsely accused me of something like that one on one much less in front of a group of people. Your son should never have been a part of this. You could have just as easily confronted your BIL without mentioning your son at all.", "NTA. You've already tried speaking to them in private. They gave no indication that your BIL has any sort of disability that prevents him from cleaning up after himself. Sounds to me like your BIL owed *you* an apology for subjecting you to such a nauseating mess.\n\nMaybe put a stack of paper towels and a waste can in the bathroom when (if) they visit again. Along with a sign that says \"If you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be neat and wipe the seat.\"", "No and NTA\n\nI agree with others that have said they just wouldn't invite him anymore. It's basic hygiene, and to behave like that in someone else's house is truly disgusting. If you wanted to apologize, you could tell them you're sorry for embarrassing him, but since you know it WILL happen again, and you WILL say something, embarrassing him again, it's easier to just not invite them anymore.", "NTA.   \nNo apology required. This is a family dinner\u2026 everyone in this family has been cleaning up after him for \u2026 years? Gross.   \nNext time he comes over leave a spray bottle of cleaner and a cloth on the cistern ready for him to do it himself.", "Why would you owe him an apology for embarrassing him when you were pretending you thought it was your son with the poor behaviour. He should be ashamed and embarrassed of HIMSELF not embarrassed because of you\n\nAlso. How is it that your sister went in there to clean up. Why didn\u2019t he get off his ass and clean it up himself. He should be embarrassed for the piss AND the fact his mommy/wife had to go clean up after his disgusting self", "NTA - and ask your sister what are you supposed to do going forward? Ban him from your house, summon her everytime he pees as you\u2019ve tried to ask him politely and privately.\n\nSo at this point, he should be embarrassed heartily, because he\u2019s a pig who doesn\u2019t care as she\u2019ll just clean up after him AND she should be embarrassed to bring him places when he does it to her family\u2019s homes.", "NTA but you owe your son an apology and an explanation. You weaponized and embarrassed him knowingly and publicly in order to shame your disgusting BIL. He didn't agree to that. You don't mention his age but you need to come up with an age-appropriate explanation asap, and possibly a gift to emphasize the apology. And praise his potty habits consistently for a while so he doesn't get confused by the mixed message you just sent. \n\nYour BIL has every right to be embarrassed. I'm concerned that your sister immediately cleaned up the mess like it's her fault. Maybe meek is her personality but keep an eye out for domestic abuse. She sounds like she has all the confidence of a doormat and might need some help.", "NTA. Your sister went to clean up his piss??? Wow.", "NTA but why in the fuck is the wife going in to clean it up? Idve blocked the bathroom door and told her, no, your HUSBAND made the mess, HE can clean it up. Needless to say, I don\u2019t get asked to throw parties or gatherings at my house\u2026 I say what I say in mine, but hold my tongue at others\u2019 houses.", "ESH - on your side, just because you didn't warn your son ahead of time and as far as we know you didn't apologize to him afterwards.  I hope you apologized to him in public and again after the relatives left.   Let him know that you appreciate his grownup courtesy, and admit that you knew it wasn't him.  \n\nYou do not owe your BIL an apology.", "NTA. That's fing gross!!  Good for you & your family for teaching your son.", "NTA and I love this. You KNEW how your son would respond. You know your kid and know if this would embarrass him or not. It didn\u2019t but did rightfully embarrass the proper party. As you\u2019ve tried to deal with the situation privately in the past with no result I think you handled this wonderfully.", "NTA and you don't owe him an apology.", "NTA! But your BIL is disgusting and disrespectful! And your sister is a disgusting enabler \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22 I would never clean up piss after my man I don\u2019t even do it for my 6 yr old nephew as I just remind him to clean up after his mishaps", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nAnd you're right, your brother-in-law is a complete pig. If you know (and how can he NOT know?) that you wanker isn't capable of a clean stream, then sit the hell down and piss. And if you make a mess, clean it up. What kind of animal does that to someone else's house, let alone their own? If someone did this at my place, male or female, they'd be banned from using the bathroom. Take it outside you sloppy pisser!", "I definitely wouldn't have said it to my son. I don't know why you didn't say it to the BIL.", "NTA... well done", "NTA. Unless your BIL is severely on the spectrum he should be cleaning up after himself (and should get his piss in the toilet unless he's over 400 pounds, it's not his wife's responsibility to clean up after him).", "NTA - and you were MUCH nicer than I was. Dead Husband (DH) had a friend come over and pissed all over the toilet and the rug. I. Stepped. In. Piss. Barefoot! I went outside to where they were sitting and told DH it was time for his friend to go home and that he wasn\u2019t allowed back over until he was housebroken.", "NTA but I would not invite them over again because he's gonna pee somewhere intentionally. \n\nOr if you do, maybe get pet pee pads and put them ALL around the guest toilet", "NTA and the apology needs to come from them, not you.", "My grandma had a poem hanging above the toilet\n\nIf you sprinkle \n\n\nWhen you tinkle\n\n\nBe a sweetie\n\n\nWipe the seatie", "Publicly ban his from the house for this shit. \"BIL isn't welcome in my home until my sister succesfully potty trains him or he learns how to clean up after himself.\"\n\nMaybe public shame for wrecking the bathroom and being too lazy to clean it up will get through to them. If not, at least you won't be dealing with it either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "YTA only cause you did that to your son; unless he was in on it, you owe him an apology. Your BIL deserves to be embarrassed.", "ROFL!  You, OP, are awesome.  So not the AH!!!!!\n\nAlso, take your son out for ice-cream and thank him for his help and apologise for embarrassing him.  Tell him it won't happen again.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you told your son that you were sorry. That\u2019s so gross and why did your sister clean up after your BIL?! He should\u2019ve done it.", "Buy a litter box and tell your BIL he can use it next time. Or leave puppy pads all over. NTA (well, maybe 10% for involving your son)", "No apology necessary.  He deserved that.  In the future pay attention and when he heads to the bathroom ask his wife to go with him to do her job cleaning up after him in the bathroom.  He could sit, he has to sit to shit, he can sit to pee and not have a mess to clean up or be embarrassed.  Good for you, that was a fantastic way to embarrass him and good for your son for speaking up!", "No apology necessary, to your BIL. You talked to them about it before. \nThat was embarrassing for your son, that is a horrible way to treat your son.", "This was a hilarious way to call him out ngl. No you do not owe him an apology, he owes you an apology for making a gross mess and expecting a woman to clean it up. He does deserve to be called out as even children know to either clean up or get someone to help.\n\nYour son however, didn't deserve to be called out in front of everyone and I would suggest you do apologize to him. \n\nTalk to your sister. Tell her that she shouldn't be cleaning up after him and ASK her to share her feelings about it. I'm sure that she's frustrated and could do with some support. Let her know that she's not responsible for this and she should not have to deal with it. Give her a safe space to talk and tell her you love her and don't want her to have to live with so little respect. \n\nYou didn't call him out directly and he did the wrong thing so you don't owe him anything, but your sister needs help because this is not normal or OK. Even if he has some kind of medical issue, that doesn't prevent him from cleaning up and he should just sit down if he can't control it. I would continue to call him out by calmly asking if he will go clean up the bathroom, not in front of others, every single time he does it. \n\nWhat you did was mad ballsy but not really a way to work through anything maturely. If you want you could speak to him and say sorry he felt called out but why didn't he clean up after himself? He'll probably say he doesn't realize but you know that's not true so I'd press on. He owes an apology to your son too really, but he probably won't offer one!", "NTA\n\nAt first, I thought you were T A for not giving your son a heads up, but since he's so young, good for you. \n\nI mean, it feels maybe like it was a little humiliating for your son, but if I'm being honest, I don't have kids, so I don't really know.\n\nWhat I do know is you don't owe your BIL an apology. Has he ever apologized for making you clean up his bodily fluids? More than once?\n\nGross", "ESH; the BIL for obvious reasons but you because you yelled at your son about something he didn't do (and that is embarrassing), and could have put him in the middle of a fight between you and the BIL--> for example, if BIL denied it and said it actually was son, or got mad at son.   \n\nIf you wanted to confront BIL in front of everyone, you could and should have just done that rather than playing a little passive-aggressive game that involved accusing your son of something gross you knew he didn't do.", "YTA. Not for how you treated your brother in law but for how you treated your son. Don't use your kids as pawns in your conflicts. You probably embarrassed him just as much as you did your brother in law.", "NTA.  You apologized to your son, as you should have. As to your BiL, You are the one owed an apology by the adult who left a mess in your bathroom.", "NTA a grown man who either doesn\u2019t notice or thinks he is above cleaning up after himself when he is a guest deserves public shaming.  I have a feeling your son will fully appreciate the story when her is older and his future wife will be most appreciative.  \n\nAs far as your sister - she needs to make her husband clean up after himself and hit the target.  He embarrassed himself with the behavior. He publicly embarrassed himself with his behavior because privately speaking about it did not get the message across.  If your houseguest acts like a pig, it is fair to name the pig.", "ESH, but you not to your BIL, only to your son. You potentially really embarrassed him and this was not his problem. \n\nYour BIL is absolutely the AH.

Apology doesn't change that.\n\nYou're an adult, so behave like one. Instead of playing manipulative games, just address the issue directly. If you're uncomfortable talking to your BIL then talk to your sister.\n\nYou should've never involved your son. Your BIL sucks and there's no reason to put up with that. Just ask them to leave and stop inviting them over and let them know exactly why. You don't have to subject your house to your BIL's bodily fluids.", "I think it was extremely unwise and unkind to humiliate your son in public like that.

I don't own a dick so I don't know how good I'd be at pissing with one, but it's basic human decency to clean up after yourself. But your poor kid must have been mortified!

Hope young fella is enjoying his new switch game!", "Nta he deserves to feel embarrassed", "Imagine, peeing all over somebody\u2019s bathroom, and then getting mad, at them!", "Agreed that the son deserves something because I bet he was sh**ting bricks when OP called him out!", " Don't you mean a \"son-day\"", "One of my son's friends was an absolute darling, and he always washed his hands afterward, but he left the sink, counter, and mirror a complete mess.  It looked like he was performing a water ritual or something.\n\nI never knew how to approach that situation.  How does one ask a teen boy to clean up more neatly?  I was ecstatic he cleaned up, period.", "Why are men so fucking OBSESSED with standing and peeing?", "He's 4 though. And she's said several times how much she's apologized and has also made it up to him quite well.\n\nEdit: I mention his age because it's completely believable that a 4 year old would be the messy one.", "Read better. She clearly said she *publicly* apologized to her son in front of BIL, which would assumingely only make his embarrassment worse.", "Son thinks mummy made a silly mistake, didn't she *see* that he hadn't been in the toilet and it was uncle? Mummy apologized for her mistake and - from her other comments - told him that he was a good boy who hadn't made a mess like that in months.\n\nSon thinks that's right, I haven't, because I'm a big boy now. Silly mummy. Yummy ice-cream.\n\nIt's really not that deep for a four year old.", "Disagree.  By showing that EVEN A LITTLE KID knows better, fat bastard was properly shamed.\n\nIf confronted directly, he'd have come up with some dodge.", "That\u2019s what I would have done. If he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, he should stop doing embarrassing things.", "Agreed. Urinals are for standing because you can miss but it would take serious effort to. As for the bowl, you should sit on it if you clearly can't aim.", "This! I'm a man - I don't sit on urinals - I don't stand at toilets. If I'm peeing in the great outdoors, I stand.\n\nDon't be selfish. Sitting to pee is not going to misgender you", "I'm also confused why people wouldn't just sit if it's not a public toilet", "Nobody is obsessed lol. Such a dramatic reaction. Standing is quicker and easier but I agree that men, and all of us, should leave places in the same or better state than we found them", "10 years ago I started a habit of peeing sitting down so that I didn\u2019t wake up my wife while she was getting her doctoral degree. I\u2019m not sitting to pee in public though, that\u2019s rarely not nasty. \n\nI still do it, but I normally go pee off the front or back porch standing, if it\u2019s cold outside. Just habits at this point.", "Because we don\u2019t like our dicks touching the seat or getting our perineum splashed by the spray of it hitting the side of the bowl. If you are even half competent, and put the seat up and down, it doesn\u2019t affect you lot in any way. Besides that, we have the equipment to, you don\u2019t. Nah nah nah boo boo! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11", "You're funny...in a viciously pitiful way, LOL.", "Can you aim when you pee? You seem super defensive and aggressive", "I think at this point you just tell them they are not welcome to come over until your BIL learns how to pee properly and keep things clean.", "Doesn\u2019t change the fact that you victimized your son.", "*Perfect*!!\n\nANOTHER layer of necessary shame for fat bastard.", "Seriously holy fuck. OP explicitly says she apologized to her son. Somehow half the gd people in this sub missed that and are shouting from the rooftops \u201cOP WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO YOUR SON?!? YOU SUCK??\u201d", "How many times does he have to say that he apologizes to his son?", "You say that like it\u2019s ok to accuse the son of something profoundly disgusting and embarrassing because it\u2019s easier for the adult than having a proper conversation with another adult.\n\nIt really isn\u2019t, and saying \u2018sorry\u2019 afterwards does not fully excuse it.", "I don't see anywhere about apologizing to the son for doing that deliberately. They say \"I apologized to my son for the mistake.\" but there was no mistake and no mention of apologizing later for doing this on purpose.", "Son probably knows what's going on too and probably wasn't terribly worried if he didn't. It sound like OP and Dad are pretty level headed.", "Says the non parent.", "UK here. I have known a couple of men to pee sitting down, but most stand up.", "If you are talking about bowls, I agree with you. Urinals and the like are meant for standing though. Not having to sit on a public seat you have no idea what has happened to is a thing.", "No, a lot of us Europeans also stand while peeing.", "DUDE, you can yell at me about piss all you want if you do that for me too. lol", "I hope the one you saw was spelled correctly", "Seriously! How is sitting going to make you \"less of a man\". It just makes you someone who isn't gross. This is way up there with I don't like to wash my a-- because it makes me \"gay.\"", "I am even more confused as to why the BIL, knowing he has bad aim, at least wouldn't lift seat while standing???? Don't all men who stand lift the seat? Hence the argument as to why the seat should be up or down?", "> Because we don\u2019t like our dicks touching the seat or getting our perineum splashed by the spray of it hitting the side of the bowl.\n\nMine goes down and hits the front-side of the toilet so I don't get splashed. Besides, whenever I stand there's a tiny risk of piss drips on my pants.\n\n>it doesn\u2019t affect you lot in any way.\n\nEven if 0,1% of piss misses, that's a lot of piss. All the piss goes in the toilet when I sit, and I can easily wipe it off for the last few drops.\n\nSitting is just a million times better, unless I'm in a hurry or outside.", "You need to invest in a better toilet my dude. If it\u2019s not an oval toilet, you\u2019re missing out. The more circular ones suck if you\u2019re over 6ft.", "That\u2019s the point, she falsely accused her son and didn\u2019t tell him ahead of time she was going to do that", "How on earth are you being downvoted. This is the easiest YTA I\u2019ve seen in a long time. \n\nOP intentionally embarrassed her young son despite knowing full well he wasn\u2019t the culprit. Y so much TA", ">like he's a toddler who has finally been potty trained\n\n*he is. she said so in the post. try reading it next time.*", "How is it an argument at all?  A man pissed all over her bathroom and now wants an apology.  That isn't an argument.", "The child is 4 FFS - kid won't even remember it.", "It may have been to protect the son. This way he can deny it before the fat slobs decide to accuse him instead. If she had directly accused the BIL he may have tried to deflect the accusations toward the child to prevent his own embarrassment", "Son doesn't need to know it was on purpose. Son is four. As far as son knows, it was a mistake and they were apologized to for the mistake.", "The kid knew he didn't do it. There was nothing to decide lol. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That depends on the dynamics. It sounds like in this case it was \"do I take the blame or call out the guy who keeps pissing in our house\".", "Did you read the post? She apologized to her son.\n\nShe is asking whether the adults deserve apologies", "Epic Name.", "As a European what I see is that men who had to clean toilets sit down, and those who don't piss standing up. All my friends piss sitting down, because it is cleaner.", "I work at a vocational school in Germany and sadly have to report: there are still pigs. \n\nSome even seem to do it on purpose. Otherwise I can\u2019t explain how even the opposite wall can be pissed on\u2026", "Mine touches the water, I was just being polite.", "Also, if you\u2019re dribbling on your pants, it\u2019s time to start doing kegel exercises so you can eventually learn to evacuate the bladder entirely under full-pressure. If kegels don\u2019t work, seek medical intervention.", "Shiiiiiiiiit, I\u2019ve got a Kohler Innate at home. Dont hafta tell me about nice toilets\u2026 my private toilet also doesn\u2019t affect GoodFaithConverser or any one else in this thread so that\u2019s an entire moot point. I don\u2019t sit to pee in public because of cleanliness reasons, and if I find myself at someone else\u2019s home and on the off chance that a droplet gets somewhere other than the bowl, I am an adult and can wipe it up. \n\nNever would I have ever thought I\u2019d be involved in a stupid Reddit conversation about toilets and piss droplets, yet here we are.", "Yeah at that point I would say it's OK for the sister to come round but not the BIL", "I don\u2019t think that she did it in front of others, though. Asking him if you could speak with him in the kitchen,telling him that he needed to go clean up the bathroom from his mess, handing him the cleaning equipment and telling him at that point that you WILL ream him out in front of the entire group if he doesn\u2019t do it would have been better.", "How does that post have that many up votes when they clearly didn't read it...?", "Yeah, but the kid knew that he had the right to defend himself.  My siblings and I did not have that right, ever.  This son is being raised right.", "If the son is 4 years old, he won't think about it at all, just react to the false accusation the way he was raised. His speaking out loudly and denying the accusation is in fact a sign that this is not a problem in this household. Her apologizing for it instantly shows how mistakes are handled in that family: by owning them. \n\nBy pretending herself to blame her son for the pee spill OP in fact \\*prevented\\* Sister and BIL trying to blame the kid and maybe doubling down on him if the kid denies. \\*She\\* apologized to the kid instantly, would the IL have done that?", "No. She\u2019s talked to him about it, not in the moment. As in, Hey, when you guys come over to my house, please be careful using the toilet. \n\nThat BIL is like a kid who doesn\u2019t understand things unless they are immediate. \n\nTake him in the kitchen right away. Hand him cleaning products and give him five minutes to clean up his own pee or be called out in front of everyone.", "I'm starting to think some people get half way though a post and decided they NEED to comment NOW, before they bother finishing the post. It's not like they can even pretend they misheard something... All the words are right there, organized in straight lines, waiting to be read! It's baffling lol.", "> Your reading and comprehension skills are not very strong, are they? She did apologize to her son.\n\nShe should never have accused him in the first place. She needs to apologize properly for doing that and follow through by not doing anything like it again.", "Sorry. The remains there are mostly the results of woman peeing, as their flow usually is not straight downwards.", "Sir, ma'am, or \\[insert gender neutral honorific here\\], her son is literally four years old.", "He IS a toddler who finally mastered potty training.", "depending on how young the kid is i don\u2019t think they give a crap. have you ever been around them? nothings private, and every topic is fair game as long as they\u2019re \u2018honest\u2019", "The way she did it was fine. The kid said it wasn't him and she immediately apologized. You're making the kids involvement a bigger issue than it needs to be. The whole **point** was she didn't WANT it to be private. She's tried taking to the guy and she's tired of him pissing all over her bathroom!", "I can't speak for everyone else, but I was in accord with \"everyone pray for this woman.\"  \ud83e\udd23", "That kid is going to become a serial killer now! Every time he raises a knife to slash his victims to ribbons, a vision will flash before him of his OWN mother, accusing him of pissing all over the toilet when it was in fact his Uncle....It was always his uncle. \"I WILL NEVER FORGIVE! NEVER FORGET MOMMA! YOU DID THIS TOO ME!\"", "Oh snap! Someone get the Aloe Vera for that burn! lmao", "Dude, if I was basically shown to be less capable of peeing than a child in front of a group, not just told but shown, that'd be some motivation. \n\nAs long as OP talks to kid, apologizes and its all good, honestly, there's no other way. Some people are nasty. I just got rid of a roommate/ friend partially due to hygiene issues. It's so hot and sweaty around him, he gets poop on the toilet seat and refuses that it's him, wipes his boogers on the light switch or couch, etc. Direct \"you need to shower you smell nasty\" \"thats gross\" \"you need to clean up after yourself\" did nothing to fix the problem.", "I think there's a great lesson in this for the kid too. \n\n- never takes fall for others, if it wasn't you, speak up for yourself\n\n- if an adult is wrong, you deserve an apology. Mum taught him he deserves an apology and that's great to teach kids.", "Please tell me where I mentioned the kid?\n\nAnd think about how people engage in gossip, for just a sec. She could have held quite a bit of power over their heads, while making sure the family gossip mill went to work. That in and of itself could have gone on for a long ass time.
