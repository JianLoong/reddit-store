You tried the private route. They ignored it. He's a grown ass man who is peeing everywhere and not cleaning up after himself. Toddlers have better self control and responsibility. Disgusting. He didn't even clean up after himself after you called him out - his wife went in to do it. He deserves to feel ashamed.", "NTA\n\n(Though you owe your son a sundae)\n\nYou've spoken to Man-Bear-Pig before about his projectile inaccuracy.  And if he can't take a second to remember the old adage, \"If you sprinkle when you tinkle please be neat and wipe the seat\", (among other things) then he deserves the bell!  SHAME!  SHAME!", "NTA\n\nA grown adult who doesn't clean his mess in the bathroom deserves to be publicly humiliated. And notice how BIL didn't go to clean after himself, your sister did.", "NTA  \n\n\nReally, I'd stop inviting them. Several of my son's friends during middle school became not-welcome at my house because they apparently had no idea how to use the toilet or clean up after themselves.", "> if an adult cannot piss properly or clean up after themselves perhaps they should be embarrassed.\n\n100% true. NTA. \n\nINFO: Why even have them over? Anyone who pisses all over the toilet and doesn't clean it up wouldn't be welcome at my house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My sister's husband is a pig.\n\nAlso true, and probably an understatment.", "NTA. Humiliate him until he can act like an adult. NEVER say sorry to a person that literally pissed all over your home.", "[removed]", "If you've already talked with them privately about the issue and it's still going on, definitely NTA. It's basic hygene and human descency to not leave your own piss all over someone else's toilet. You may go ahead and apologize anyways, because this incident may have impacted the BIL and he might clean things up in the future.", " Nta, I don\u2019t want to clean up someone else\u2019s bodily fluids. He should not be embarrassed, nobody should have found out. He should have looked at the toilet and said to himself nobody has pissed on the seat or the floor, after he made a mess he should have cleaned it. He is an asshole.", "Since you've talked about it before to them in private, and nothing changed, I'd say NTA. That's disgusting, and your bil needed a reality check one way or another. The one thing I have an issue with is involving your son in the situation without any warning", "I think you owe an apology to your son. I would be mortified if someone falsely accused me of something like that one on one much less in front of a group of people. Your son should never have been a part of this. You could have just as easily confronted your BIL without mentioning your son at all.", "NTA. You've already tried speaking to them in private. They gave no indication that your BIL has any sort of disability that prevents him from cleaning up after himself. Sounds to me like your BIL owed *you* an apology for subjecting you to such a nauseating mess.\n\nMaybe put a stack of paper towels and a waste can in the bathroom when (if) they visit again. Along with a sign that says \"If you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be neat and wipe the seat.\"", "No and NTA\n\nI agree with others that have said they just wouldn't invite him anymore. It's basic hygiene, and to behave like that in someone else's house is truly disgusting. If you wanted to apologize, you could tell them you're sorry for embarrassing him, but since you know it WILL happen again, and you WILL say something, embarrassing him again, it's easier to just not invite them anymore.", "NTA.   \nNo apology required. This is a family dinner\u2026 everyone in this family has been cleaning up after him for \u2026 years? Gross.   \nNext time he comes over leave a spray bottle of cleaner and a cloth on the cistern ready for him to do it himself.", "Why would you owe him an apology for embarrassing him when you were pretending you thought it was your son with the poor behaviour. He should be ashamed and embarrassed of HIMSELF not embarrassed because of you\n\nAlso. How is it that your sister went in there to clean up. Why didn\u2019t he get off his ass and clean it up himself. He should be embarrassed for the piss AND the fact his mommy/wife had to go clean up after his disgusting self", "NTA - and ask your sister what are you supposed to do going forward? Ban him from your house, summon her everytime he pees as you\u2019ve tried to ask him politely and privately.\n\nSo at this point, he should be embarrassed heartily, because he\u2019s a pig who doesn\u2019t care as she\u2019ll just clean up after him AND she should be embarrassed to bring him places when he does it to her family\u2019s homes.", "NTA but you owe your son an apology and an explanation. You weaponized and embarrassed him knowingly and publicly in order to shame your disgusting BIL. He didn't agree to that. You don't mention his age but you need to come up with an age-appropriate explanation asap, and possibly a gift to emphasize the apology. And praise his potty habits consistently for a while so he doesn't get confused by the mixed message you just sent. \n\nYour BIL has every right to be embarrassed. I'm concerned that your sister immediately cleaned up the mess like it's her fault. Maybe meek is her personality but keep an eye out for domestic abuse. She sounds like she has all the confidence of a doormat and might need some help.", "NTA. Your sister went to clean up his piss??? Wow.", "NTA but why in the fuck is the wife going in to clean it up? Idve blocked the bathroom door and told her, no, your HUSBAND made the mess, HE can clean it up. Needless to say, I don\u2019t get asked to throw parties or gatherings at my house\u2026 I say what I say in mine, but hold my tongue at others\u2019 houses.", "ESH - on your side, just because you didn't warn your son ahead of time and as far as we know you didn't apologize to him afterwards.  I hope you apologized to him in public and again after the relatives left.   Let him know that you appreciate his grownup courtesy, and admit that you knew it wasn't him.  \n\nYou do not owe your BIL an apology.", "NTA. That's fing gross!!  Good for you & your family for teaching your son.", "NTA and I love this. You KNEW how your son would respond. You know your kid and know if this would embarrass him or not. It didn\u2019t but did rightfully embarrass the proper party. As you\u2019ve tried to deal with the situation privately in the past with no result I think you handled this wonderfully.", "NTA and you don't owe him an apology.", "NTA! But your BIL is disgusting and disrespectful! And your sister is a disgusting enabler \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22 I would never clean up piss after my man I don\u2019t even do it for my 6 yr old nephew as I just remind him to clean up after his mishaps", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nAnd you're right, your brother-in-law is a complete pig. If you know (and how can he NOT know?) that you wanker isn't capable of a clean stream, then sit the hell down and piss. And if you make a mess, clean it up. What kind of animal does that to someone else's house, let alone their own? If someone did this at my place, male or female, they'd be banned from using the bathroom. Take it outside you sloppy pisser!", "I definitely wouldn't have said it to my son. I don't know why you didn't say it to the BIL.", "NTA... well done", "NTA. Unless your BIL is severely on the spectrum he should be cleaning up after himself (and should get his piss in the toilet unless he's over 400 pounds, it's not his wife's responsibility to clean up after him).", "NTA - and you were MUCH nicer than I was. Dead Husband (DH) had a friend come over and pissed all over the toilet and the rug. I. Stepped. In. Piss. Barefoot! I went outside to where they were sitting and told DH it was time for his friend to go home and that he wasn\u2019t allowed back over until he was housebroken.", "NTA but I would not invite them over again because he's gonna pee somewhere intentionally. \n\nOr if you do, maybe get pet pee pads and put them ALL around the guest toilet", "NTA and the apology needs to come from them, not you.", "My grandma had a poem hanging above the toilet\n\nIf you sprinkle \n\n\nWhen you tinkle\n\n\nBe a sweetie\n\n\nWipe the seatie", "Publicly ban his from the house for this shit. \"BIL isn't welcome in my home until my sister succesfully potty trains him or he learns how to clean up after himself.\"\n\nMaybe public shame for wrecking the bathroom and being too lazy to clean it up will get through to them. If not, at least you won't be dealing with it either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "YTA only cause you did that to your son; unless he was in on it, you owe him an apology. Your BIL deserves to be embarrassed.", "ROFL!  You, OP, are awesome.  So not the AH!!!!!\n\nAlso, take your son out for ice-cream and thank him for his help and apologise for embarrassing him.  Tell him it won't happen again.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you told your son that you were sorry. That\u2019s so gross and why did your sister clean up after your BIL?! He should\u2019ve done it.", "Buy a litter box and tell your BIL he can use it next time. Or leave puppy pads all over. NTA (well, maybe 10% for involving your son)", "No apology necessary.  He deserved that.  In the future pay attention and when he heads to the bathroom ask his wife to go with him to do her job cleaning up after him in the bathroom.  He could sit, he has to sit to shit, he can sit to pee and not have a mess to clean up or be embarrassed.  Good for you, that was a fantastic way to embarrass him and good for your son for speaking up!", "No apology necessary, to your BIL. You talked to them about it before. \nThat was embarrassing for your son, that is a horrible way to treat your son.", "This was a hilarious way to call him out ngl. No you do not owe him an apology, he owes you an apology for making a gross mess and expecting a woman to clean it up. He does deserve to be called out as even children know to either clean up or get someone to help.\n\nYour son however, didn't deserve to be called out in front of everyone and I would suggest you do apologize to him. \n\nTalk to your sister. Tell her that she shouldn't be cleaning up after him and ASK her to share her feelings about it. I'm sure that she's frustrated and could do with some support. Let her know that she's not responsible for this and she should not have to deal with it. Give her a safe space to talk and tell her you love her and don't want her to have to live with so little respect. \n\nYou didn't call him out directly and he did the wrong thing so you don't owe him anything, but your sister needs help because this is not normal or OK. Even if he has some kind of medical issue, that doesn't prevent him from cleaning up and he should just sit down if he can't control it. I would continue to call him out by calmly asking if he will go clean up the bathroom, not in front of others, every single time he does it. \n\nWhat you did was mad ballsy but not really a way to work through anything maturely. If you want you could speak to him and say sorry he felt called out but why didn't he clean up after himself? He'll probably say he doesn't realize but you know that's not true so I'd press on. He owes an apology to your son too really, but he probably won't offer one!", "NTA\n\nAt first, I thought you were T A for not giving your son a heads up, but since he's so young, good for you. \n\nI mean, it feels maybe like it was a little humiliating for your son, but if I'm being honest, I don't have kids, so I don't really know.\n\nWhat I do know is you don't owe your BIL an apology. Has he ever apologized for making you clean up his bodily fluids? More than once?\n\nGross", "ESH; the BIL for obvious reasons but you because you yelled at your son about something he didn't do (and that is embarrassing), and could have put him in the middle of a fight between you and the BIL--> for example, if BIL denied it and said it actually was son, or got mad at son.   \n\nIf you wanted to confront BIL in front of everyone, you could and should have just done that rather than playing a little passive-aggressive game that involved accusing your son of something gross you knew he didn't do.", "YTA. Not for how you treated your brother in law but for how you treated your son. Don't use your kids as pawns in your conflicts. You probably embarrassed him just as much as you did your brother in law.", "NTA.  You apologized to your son, as you should have. As to your BiL, You are the one owed an apology by the adult who left a mess in your bathroom.", "NTA a grown man who either doesn\u2019t notice or thinks he is above cleaning up after himself when he is a guest deserves public shaming.  I have a feeling your son will fully appreciate the story when her is older and his future wife will be most appreciative.  \n\nAs far as your sister - she needs to make her husband clean up after himself and hit the target.  He embarrassed himself with the behavior. He publicly embarrassed himself with his behavior because privately speaking about it did not get the message across.  If your houseguest acts like a pig, it is fair to name the pig.", "ESH, but you not to your BIL, only to your son. You potentially really embarrassed him and this was not his problem. \n\nYour BIL is absolutely the AH.

Apology doesn't change that.\n\nYou're an adult, so behave like one. Instead of playing manipulative games, just address the issue directly. If you're uncomfortable talking to your BIL then talk to your sister.\n\nYou should've never involved your son. Your BIL sucks and there's no reason to put up with that. Just ask them to leave and stop inviting them over and let them know exactly why. You don't have to subject your house to your BIL's bodily fluids.", "I think it was extremely unwise and unkind to humiliate your son in public like that. Even though you apologized, now he knows that you're willing to do that to him.

I don't own a dick so I don't know how good I'd be at pissing with one, but it's basic human decency to clean up after yourself. But your poor kid must have been mortified!

I think you already know that involving your son like that was wrong, so you're trying to shift focus back to your BIL.\n\n\nJust out of curiosity, when you apologized, did you explain that you knew he didn't do anything wrong, but you publicly accused him of it anyway? Or did you just say you were sorry for doing it, leading him to believe you mistakenly, publicly accused him of it? Not that it matters too much since you publicly accused him of something shameful, but again, curiosity.", "Fair enough.  Sorry I missed the note about that in the original.", "AND she bought him a new game for his Switch! I\u2019m sure the kid understands how sorry she was for doing that in front of people.

They're upset because she publicly accused her son of something shameful that she knew he didn't do.

You're the one getting upset over something YOU projected onto OP.\n\nThe 4 year old is less fragile than you.

He set it on the floor in front of him, then sat down to pee.  He wasn't paying attention to the angle of his dangle, and instead of peeing into the bowl he just peed on his laptop instead.

Why not tell him \"This is it, you're no longer invited to my home for this reason\" before flying off the handle?", "Doesn't matter. Then she tells him again. Or stops letting him come over. Or something. Not use her son that way.", "I think the disconnect here is you are focusing on the public shaming where they agree, NTA.  Where they have a different opinion is in the accusing the son.  You write because she apologized it is all good.  They write that it still makes her the AH.\n\nPerhaps try an identical scenario.  You work in an office.  The spouse of a board member has a habit of leaving poo on the toilet seat every time they go.  The boss has tried addressing it directly and privately to no avail.  During the Christmas party the poop smearer left their signature on the seat.  The boss knows who did it because they used the bathroom right before.  They know you did not do it yet the boss goes up to the mic and proclaims to the entire office \"Scorp128, you left poo all over the toilet seat, please go clean it up.\"  You then say \"It was not me, it was the board member's spouse.\"  They get embarrassed and go clean it up.  The admin goes \"oh, sorry Scorp128.\" The board member is mad at the boss for publically shaming their spouse.  They go to Redit to ask \"AITA?\"  Some people say \"not for publically shaming the partner, but yes for blaming you in front of the whole office.\"  Others say \"The admin apologized to Scorp128 though, can't you read?\"\n\nNow in that situation, maybe you think the boss' apology makes it all good, maybe not.  Maybe you think the fact the boss tried addressing directly before makes it OK, maybe not.  Maybe you belive that since you are the subordinate it is OK for the boss to include you like that, maybe not.  Maybe you have the opinion that the resulting shame the poopatrator must have felt made it worth the awkward moment where the whole office though you had poor potty skills, maybe not.\n\nI believe the point they are trying top make is that OP could have acheived the same result by \"...marching out of the bathroom and I telling my BIL in a loud voice that he had to go clean his pee up since he sprayed everywhere.\"  Using the 4-year-old in this way is passive aggressive.  If you want to publically shame the adult, do it.  There is no need to risk embarassing a child you know is innocent just so you can feign ignorance, particularly when no one is even going to believe the lie, because \"it is known.\"\n\nNote that  OP \"apologized to their son for the mistake.\" Which is, by definition, insincere because OP knows fully well they did not make a mistake.  That apology was just the next line in the little drama that OP was acting out.  If they truly felt they owed the child an apology they would apologize for what they actually did, which was falsely blaming him.", "Have you met 4yos? This would not humiliate someone.", "He wasn't humiliated for goodness sake!", "You're absolutely right. Traumatizing your kid for no reason and buying them a video game to \"make up for it\" is shitty parenting 101. I am shocked that so many people seem fine with OP using her kid like this.", "10000%. This shouldn't even be a conversation.", "No, it points down anyway, so no issue", "I live in the south, and the heat and humidity with rain makes it 100x worse. The side of my uncle\u2019s house reeks of piss because he and my cousin have pissed there for years.

Or is it only ok if they are impressionable and naive?\n\n\"Apologize\" was in quotes because, as you alluded to, I doubt she admitted to her son that she knew he had done nothing wrong when she accused him of peeing everywhere. She apologized for accusing him, but she likely didn't apologize for accusing him even though she knew he did nothing wrong.", "Yes it\u2019s a very impolite thing to do, but I\u2019ve seen enough Reddit posts to firmly believe that a man would be getting roasted if he started off his post by calling his sister-in-law a fat pig and then yelled at his daughter to prove a point to SIL about cleaning up", ">They could have publicly called out BIL without mentioning their son.\n\nAbsolutely!  It's a reprehensible shame that so very many posters are actually applauding this codependent game-playing nonsense in which OP uses *her own son* because she is too spineless to make a point like a grown woman.  \n\nI don't care that OP has told BIL before and it didn't work. Tell him agan! Geez!  OP shouldn't play juvenile communication games (*involving her own son's urination habits*) unless she wants him grow up with the same lack of integrity that she demosntrates.", "My dude, the kid is 4 years old. I have lost count the amount of times in my childhood where one of my parents thought and said I had done something, I stood up for myself as the kid did, it was discovered I did not do said thing, an apology was made and life moved on. Parents are human and make mistakes. Parents owning up to the mistake and apologizing is a good way of modeling how to behave like an actual adult. But by all means, start a go fund account for the kid...I'm sure his entire life is ruined because of this and he will need massive amounts of therapy to recover \ud83d\ude12", "Agreed.

See how that works with no proof? \n\nI also ferment urine for use in the garden. Store it out in the woods. Get donations from people and store it in a vat.", "Involving the son was a power move though. It emphasized that BILs behavior was akin to that of child, further embarrassing BIL. She made it clear that she would never have guessed that BIL was responsible because no self sufficient adult would behave that way. Everyone hearing it from a child rather than her solidified the fact that it was indeed BIL. This also removed the chance for BIL to lay blame on the child. Lastly, it offered BIL an out to simply clean it up without alerting everyone that this is a trend and not an accident. \n\nI vote that it was absolutely brilliant and that the apology to the child in front of everyone was just as powerful as the accusation. \n\nKudos OP. I'm sure your son knows you knew it wasn't him, if not, make sure to have a follow-up conversation.", "That is quite the over-reaction", "You don\u2019t have kids, do you."]}
