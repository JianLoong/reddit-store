Lock down her credit immediately; it's pretty easy to do. He could be trying to open a credit card or get a loan in her name.", "You do not need a social security number in order to put someone as a beneficiary to a policy.", "NTA because there is literally zero reason to have your daughter\u2019s SSN, but why isn\u2019t he paying child support?", "NTA there doesn't seem to be a good reason for him to have it.  The tax thing is the most likely reason a parent would need it.  If he really, really needs it, he should go through the courts IMO.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t give him  the social either. If he has no involvement in her life he does not need it. Besides as her parent he could actually just request it from social security himself. So I would say if he doesn\u2019t know that, there is no reason to help him out. He could be planning something shady like claiming her on his taxes and then it would create a whole mess for you.", "NTA. Nonono. \n\nThere is no good reason for him to have it.", "NTA, if he keeps asking for a SSN for different reasons, sounds like he wants because he intends to use if for financial gain, like applying for social services or something.  It would be easier for him to do it and get away with it if you are living in different states.  If you are really concerned about it contact a lawyer, hopefully you have legal aid lawyers in your state that can answer your questions for free.", "NTA.  Your EX is trying to pull a fast one.", "NTA. He's trying to pull something. Tell him that you're not providing her son unless by court order.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Best to avoid that by not providing the numbers.", "NTA I've made my niece and nephew beneficiaries without their SSNs. This could ONLY have nefarious motives.", "NTA- please do not give him any information. My biological mother, who did not raise me, used my social to put several credit cards and utility bills in my name. We didn\u2019t find out until I was 16 and was sent a letter from a debt collector. At that point I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from my \u201cmother\u201d since I was 2. It took years of back and forth and sending multiple copies of proof that I was a minor to get it cleared. I almost started off with over 30k in debt before I was even 18. What\u2019s worse is she never apologized for it. Even when my adoptive family confronted her with proof she wasn\u2019t sorry. \n\nPlease trust your instinct on this.  You will never be wrong for protecting your child\u2019s future. Being a parent is more than just contributing DNA. If he hasn\u2019t played a part in raising her he should have access to her information.", "NTA, tell him you will provide paperwork directly to the insurance company. Sounds shady.", "NTA. Your instinct is correct. Do not give them her SSN #. I'd bet money they are going to try and claim her for some kind of benefit.", "NTA - do not give him your daughter's SSN.  EVER!!!  You know he's up to no good.  If he wants something from someone, your daughter has no business being the catalyst for him.", "Nope and do NOT give it to him.  It sounds suspicious, and there are a lot of parents who get that info and open accounts in their kids names.  Ruining their credit before their of legal age. \n\nYour job is to keep her safe at all cost, that includes her credit. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  DO NOT GIVE HER SSN to him.  He will ruin her credit before her next birthday", "NTA - he doesn't need it. don't trust this guy. You are protecting your daughter by not giving him the info", "lol\n\nHe wants to claim her on his taxes. If he doesn\u2019t see her or support her, he doesn\u2019t care about her. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you file for child support???", "I would bet my next paycheck, despite not being able to afford it, because I am THAT confident that this man is trying to do shady shit with her credit. Chances are he\u2019s gotten himself into a bad spot with debt collectors.\n\nWhat does your custody look like? You say he doesn\u2019t pay child support? It may be time to go back to court. Because ideally I would just tell him to contact your lawyer with requests, or not at all.", "NTA.  There is no need for the SSN in any of those examples.  It sounds to much like he wants it for his own use, i.e. open a credit card.", "I do have her credit locked down! Thank you! I\u2019m feeling the same thing.", "I had a friend whose mother ruined her credit before she was 18 because she opened up credit and loans under her name.\n\nAnd an old acquaintance who wanted to move out of her mom's place because her mother hates her BF (every woman with common sense does) and wouldn't allow him inside. However, a bill needed to be under someone's name for the apartment she wanted. She couldn't do it because she was still paying off bills that she put under her name for an ex, and her mother said no. After a day of thinking, she told me her brilliant idea, which was to use her then 4 year old son's SSN to put the bill under his name. Because \"they just need a SSN and a name. They don't need the birth date, so I'm good.\" I was so happy that she was rejected, but it was because she had an old assault charge on her record.", "This. \n\nNTA. He\u2019s trying to claim her on taxes, most likely. If he files before you, he gets it and the process to fix that is pretty cumbersome. \n\nDon\u2019t give it to him.", "^^^ this. OP, do not give it to him. NTA.", "That\u2019s not true. Some policies do in fact require a social security number. I\u2019ve had 3 different workplaces require the social of people that will be on the health and life insurance beneficiaries", "He doesn\u2019t pay child support because we opted out of Friend of the court with the agreement that he would pay a certain amount a month to me personally to go towards her care. He hasn\u2019t done that. I don\u2019t push it because I\u2019m honestly a little scared of what he\u2019ll do.", "If he isn't making any financial contribution to her, it must be for something suss. The dude is shady AF. I mean he doesn't even pay child support. How can you trust him?", "Your daughter deserves that money.  Raising a child is heinously expensive.  College is heinously expensive.  It is not fair for you to shoulder all of the expenses yourself and it\u2019s not fair to your daughter either.  Please reconsider the situation and petition the court for assistance in collecting the money your daughter is due."]}
