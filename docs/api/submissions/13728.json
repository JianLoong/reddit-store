He will struggle in relationships, either because they mistrust him after hearing his history or because they don\u2019t want to hitch themselves to the difficulties this conviction will create. \n\nYou need to talk to your wife. Hear her side, give her a chance, and try to come up with a compromise.

College dropout but is overqualified, mom is right, he is very \u201cspecial\u201d boy.", "This is it YTA", "And probably not his wife either since it seems like with him cutting off the money to their joint account, this train is headed straight to Divorce Land.", "Yeah, it's always ridiculous to see people blaming the parents and something must have gotten wrong in the upbringing.\n\nMy mother was a single mother, our father a deadbeat who never paid a cent. My brother suddely turned his back on all of us and started engaging with our father and later saying \"Oh his side of the family is so much better\", when this asshole never paid a cent, while our mother was struggling to take care of a baby and a toddler. And then he cut contact with all of us, but not before he asked everyone for money and to never pay it back, despite having a stable, good paying job for 10y. He owes our mother, who can barely work, about 500\u20ac still, or more. She still tries to get in contact with him, does this and this for christmas and his birthday but he can't even bother to wish her a Happy Birthday, and he also lives a 2min walk away...\n\nI cut contact with him years ago, because he made a total 180\u00b0 and talked so much shit it was insane. I think the last time was when I asked him, if he wants to share the costs for a phone for our mothers birthday and he got at me with \"Ah yes I'm good enough for money\", when I never asked him for any money ever, except asking him if he wants share the costs of a gift?!\n\nWe all have no idea how this even happened, but our uncle is kinda the same \"black sheep\" with talking shit and lying non-stop and my brother got a lot of the stuff he's saying from him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI definitely didn't turn out like him. I see my mother weekly and I make lunch etc and help her with a lot of handiwork and the rest of the family gets along great.", "He's going to be there either way after the divorce.", "Thanks! I\u2019ll edit this for this AITA. I have no clue how that happened. I hadn\u2019t even read this story before just now.", "I have friends who paid big bucks for a lawyer for their son who was facing time for a second DUI. The prospect of being locked up was a big wake-up call. The son cleaned up his act and over time repaid every penny to his parents. I guess I believe that people can change.", "Depends on jurisdiction... in CA it's $950 while in TX it's 2500.\n\nStill, not worthwhile.", "shit happens, no worries, man.", "Interesting! I remember reading about generational trauma- that someone can still feel the effects of trauma from a direct ancestor they've never even met.", "Yes. My ex husband did whatever he wanted. Thankfully, we didn't have kids. But the only consequence was divorce. I couldn't stop him from doing what he was going to do. He would go to any lengths to achieve it.", "Hey OP!  Tell your wife your son is better off with a public defender. It\u2019s true! DM or reply with any questions.", "NTA \nIDK if you\u2019ve only just out your foot down or if you and wife just haven\u2019t been in the same page in dealing with him. \nHe is a criminal.  He STOLE from friends and roommates.  Rather than get a job he stole from his friends and family.  She keeps helping him,  he never figures out how to support himself and he is left totally unprepared for life when her $ runs out and/or your marriage ends.  Does she have a plan for when you and she are no longer alive? BC he will still be sucking her dry until she\u2019s dead.  \n\nI applaud you for trying to force him to be accountable for his life and his actions.   I know it\u2019s hard to be but it\u2019s what\u2019s required as a good parent: forcing them to stand on their own, not coddling them so they never can. \n\nUnfortunately , I have a version of this son.   Heartbreakingly,  he is an emotional  and financial burden.  And bc of his comfort with stealing from friends and family; he is no longer welcome to anyone\u2019s homes; any holidays or any family gatherings.  His sister is recently  engaged and shared to can\u2019t see inviting him to the wedding bc: 1) most of the guests he has stolen from \n2) she fully expects he\u2019d steal the envelopes.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay a cent. It will get hard cause your wife might get really upset with you. Obviously he hasn\u2019t learned how life works yet. Maybe he will now.", "A felony is only going to make his life harder and he will get worse.", "I was a cop for 30 years. Many times I saw mom and dad (in their 70's) come to the jail at 2AM to post bail for their son that was in the 40 - 50. Just like they had been doing forever.", "Nta", "While she is trying to CODDLE kiddo/grown ass man, how about you talking to a divorce lawyer.  Mommy doesn't want her SPECIAL snot flake to grow up....EVER.  NTA.", "NTA Children have to grow up at some point. So do mothers.", "NTA. He wanted to play with the big boys with his investments? He gets to take his lumps like the big boys do when the investments don't work out. He wanted to be a criminal? Felonies are for criminals. You and your wife bailing him out teaches him absolutely nothing.", "The question was whether he was an ass for letting his son pay for his consequences, not whether he blames his wife. He was an ass for saying it was his wife\u2019s fault, but absolutely NTA for letting his son sort out his own mess.\n\nAnd despite a parents best efforts, some kids can just turn out really terrible.", "I had a brother like OP\u2019s. When my brother was in high school, he was going down the wrong path. My dad was very strict & tried to discipline him. My mom told dad, \u201cDon\u2019t make me have to choose between you and him because I will divorce you.\u201d That\u2019s when my dad decided the brother was a lost cause. 10 years later dad dies of cancer. From that point on, my mom supported brother until he OD\u2019d at 40. It was such a waste of a human being.  It took about 10 years after brother\u2019s death for her to see that she was the main cause of his behavior.", "Sounds to me like your enabling of her enabled her enabling of him. You indulged her when she whined and cried, after he complained and cried. You both are at fault here.", "sometimes they do, this is true.  have seen it go the other way sooo many times, but good point that many does not equal always.", "I still think that's just tone policing. If OP verbally self-flagelated himself instead of his wife would that change your opinion? To me what happened 10 15 20 etc years ago matters less than their reaction now to their son being a criminal. I think OP has the correct response and his wife is trying to delay the inevitable at her sons long term expense.", ">I actually would have jumped to his defense in that hypothetical case. \n\nReally? You'd have defended a guy policing his wife's speech in order to put his kid down and make said kid understand he's stupider than his mum thinks?\n\nMy wife keeps calling our 10-year-old son \"my smart boy\" and \"my little genius\". I don't think he's all that intelligent, so I've started saying \"No, son, you are no smart boy/genius, at best, you are average\" every time she addresses him this way, because I don't want him to end up thinking he's better than he actually is or with an inflated ego. AITA?\n\nAnd you'd be here like: NTA, you are doing the right thing. But you might want to consider family therapy (to address...what? the wife's way of talking to the kid?)\n\nI...don't believe you'd stand up for the hypothetical OP.", "I suspect that drugs are involved. Otherwise he would have realized that they would figure it out.", ">I did not suggest that OP should have done that. Where did I say it would have been better for them to divorce sooner?\n\nHow does he stop her from using their *joint* account to bail the son out while the joint account still exists, considering he actually ended up separating their finances without her approval in order to prevent her from using their *joint* funds for the son? And why do you think they are headed for divorce if it wouldn't be the result of him unilaterally separating their finances and his refusal to support the son?", "ouch.  glad you left that asshole.  hope you have much better fortune from now on, and never have to lay eyes on the bastard ever again.  some guys really have no value at all other than organic fertilizer.", "I may be biased here but NTA. I hate how some parents bail their crappy kids out of jail time and time again. Sometimes, though you love them, kids have to learn a hard lesson. They need to be held accountable for their mistakes, just like the rest of us. Your wife sounds like she is blinded by her love for her son, which is understandable. But at the end of the day, he committed the crime so he should face his punishment. Try explaining to your wife that if your son never has consequences, he's never going to change.", "NTA", "Over qualified my ass. That lazy bum just don't want to work. He is a college dropout who is over qualified lmao. Ask someone that works in HR and they will say something similar.", "NTA. However you can't just blame your wife for this. The son is an adult.", "Nta", "NTA. There's a point of no return here and your son has passed it, I think.", "How did you contribute to his upbringing? Lol you are his father. What values and morals did you teach him?", "You are not the asshole.  Your son needs to be taught a lesson. Your son will never learn or change his ways if your wife continues to enabling him.  She needs to stop.", "YTA. You suck.", "N T A for not helping. He did something insanely stupid and has to pay for it. Though cops DO trick people (it's well documented, they'll emotionally manipulate people into confessions. I highly suggest looking into that if you don't believe me) but if he's guilty, he deserves what comes next.   \n\n\nYTA however for acting like this is entirely your wife's fault and letting it get to this point as if you couldn't have done something to prevent this from happening. Intervened sooner, cracked down on him, made him learn- Instead you cut him dry until he was so desperate he did something stupid. Though now with his confession I doubt your son will get anything better than a plea bargain or a reduced sentence no matter what happens so it may be a bit too late.", "I like how mom is the one who is coddling the son but it's dad's fault because *of course* the parental shortcomings must be all his fault and *never* his wife's fault. \n\nIt's the wife that didn't want to cut off bank of M&D so why aren't you blaming the wife? Why are you faulting OP? You seem to be contradicting yourself in your comment. \n\nOP is NTA for the question asked here. Whether he's a good or bad parent is irrelevant.", "Why isn't this ESH? The wife and son are still culpable for their enabling immaturity and theiving, respectively.", "Well if nothing else, I believe it\u2019s becoming very clear where Becker has learned to blame others for his own missteps.", "A lot of narcissists go undiagnosed so you\u2019d be right (because duh, they\u2019re too perfect to even confront their own mental health as anything other than perfect)", "That's a good point, I worked at a call center with several people who had a master's as well", "Ya know\u2026 I think what goes around comes around. You might see your day yet. \n\nMy ex tried to strangle me in 2010. I had numerous police reports and a restraining order but nobody did anything so I moved across the country. \n\nAnd three years later I got a call. \u2018I\u2019m a district attorney in NY do you know why I\u2019m calling you?\u2019 I asked, \u2018did he kill someone?\u2019 She said, \u2018who?\u2019 I said \u2018x\u2019. She said \u2018why would you say that?\u2019 I said \u2018because I always assumed he would.\u2019 I was \u2018Jane Doe #1\u2019 in that case to prove pattern. He finally did something the prosecutors felt was worthy of locking him up. He went to prison. \n\nPeople don\u2019t get away with this stuff forever, in my experience."]}
