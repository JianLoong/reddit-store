He needed to learn one before the felony charges, actually - sounds like you and your wife deprived him of that.\n\nThe only objection I have with your argument is how much you blame your wife. Unless she was really working hard to hide it from you, it\u2019s your responsibility as a parent to stop her spoiling him, and provide the structure he needs. \n\nNow, it sounds like your son has taken your lessons and thrown them back in your face, so I sympathize. Just don\u2019t put this all on your wife and cast yourself as a helpless bystander. It\u2019s time to make her hear you and come up with a unified front with clear boundaries for your son. This won\u2019t go away. If he\u2019s convicted, he\u2019ll find it incredibly difficult to get even those jobs he\u2019s \u2018overqualified\u2019 for. He will struggle to find a place that will rent to a felon. He will struggle in relationships, either because they mistrust him after hearing his history or because they don\u2019t want to hitch themselves to the difficulties this conviction will create. \n\nYou need to talk to your wife. Hear her side, give her a chance, and try to come up with a compromise.

I\u2019ve lived through very similar situations and I have seen this nightmare up close.\n\nAnd he can save his BS excuses about being overqualified for restaurant work. Many (and I do mean MANY) servers hold degrees unrelated to the hospitality industry. It\u2019s actually kinda funny, but most of them make better bank serving in restaurants. And that\u2019s why they stay. Fun little tip about back of house restaurant workers: many of them have records. That doesn\u2019t stop them from being hired. It\u2019s kind of a given in the industry. My female relatives and friends who are servers often \u2018joke\u2019 to obnoxious male customers who won\u2019t stop trying to hit on them, that if they don\u2019t stop the harassment, they\u2019re gonna pull the cook out of the kitchen and he\u2019ll teach them some manners. \u201cMy cook adores me and he\u2019s not afraid to go back to jail.\u201d Works every time, Lol\n\nYour son is a lazy and manipulative mooch who has finally hit a wall. Too bad his mommy wants to help him tunnel through that wall, because she\u2019s the one who\u2019s gonna get the dirtiest and most ragged. He\u2019ll just suck her dry until he latches on to a new host. Parasites are like that.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You have the right attitude. Oh, and any 27 year old not living under a rock has seen hundreds if not thousands of cop shows (and true crime shows). He\u2019s a moron to NOT keep his mouth shut and to NOT ask for a lawyer.
