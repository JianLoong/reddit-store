This is a full grown man who will probably be happy dragging you and your wife down to the poorhouse with him, before bouncing without so much as a thank you. \n\nYour adult son committed crimes against his FRIENDS for Pete\u2019s sake. If your wife wants to blow her money on this guy then so be it, but everyone needs to stop pretending that he is a genius. My wife had a favorite son - told him how wonderful he was for years and years, and excused all his abuses. He is a train wreck today thanks to her.", "NTA - your son is a grown man who can live with the consequences of his actions and you\u2019ve tried to help him in the past but he just wants to keep shoving the snake oil nonsense at his friends and families.\nHe\u2019s learning a valuable lesson that actions do have consequences.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. If he's gonna steal, let him sit in jail and think about it. It isn't your job to rescue him after bad decisions", "NTA. Your son may very well be intelligent, but he lacks the sense God gave a walnut. His entire adult life has been a series of terrible decisions that has culminated in felony charges. As a parent, all you can really do in the grand scheme of things is give your kids the skillset they\u2019ll need to walk whatever path they choose in life and hope for the best. You are under no obligation to help him out at this point.", "NTA Police will usually tell you it's a civil matter when stealing from roommates and no charges are made. He had to have stolen items of high value to be arrested. He may be your son, but at some point he has to face the consequences of his actions.", "NTA the \"kid\" is freaking 27. Looks like he's got a lot of hard lessons to learn now..", "Stealing is unnacceptable, an you're saying he stole from his friends... Sounds really bad. Sorry I also think he is spoiled, irresponsible, arrogant boy. He should learn that his actions have consequences.\n\nThe fact that he's mad because he was \"tricked\" by the cops is unbelievable, sounds like he doesn't even feel bad for stealing. You wife isn't doing him a favor by covering him all the time. NTA.", "Sounds like this kid needed a reality check a long time ago...\n\nNTA", "NTA, but be prepared to have to cut off the Bank of Spouse and get divorced if she insists on ruining your lives over your worthless adult child.", "YTA not for the title, but for blaming your wife for all your parental shortcomings\n\nA 27y.o is an adult, not a work in progress. This situation was set in motion a long time ago. The fact that you've only just cut off the bank of M&D is a big clue", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m 27, and I too invested a little in Shiba (the crypto boom was too fun to resist). I should be right in the sympathetic demographic for your son. \n\nI still wouldn\u2019t fund his defense.\n\nHe needs to learn a lesson. He needed to learn one before the felony charges, actually - sounds like you and your wife deprived him of that.\n\nThe only objection I have with your argument is how much you blame your wife. Unless she was really working hard to hide it from you, it\u2019s your responsibility as a parent to stop her spoiling him, and provide the structure he needs. \n\nNow, it sounds like your son has taken your lessons and thrown them back in your face, so I sympathize. Just don\u2019t put this all on your wife and cast yourself as a helpless bystander. It\u2019s time to make her hear you and come up with a unified front with clear boundaries for your son. This won\u2019t go away. If he\u2019s convicted, he\u2019ll find it incredibly difficult to get even those jobs he\u2019s \u2018overqualified\u2019 for. He will struggle to find a place that will rent to a felon. He will struggle in relationships, either because they mistrust him after hearing his history or because they don\u2019t want to hitch themselves to the difficulties this conviction will create. \n\nYou need to talk to your wife. Hear her side, give her a chance, and try to come up with a compromise. She has to be given the opportunity to see what she\u2019s done to her son, the chance to come around and make better choices that will feel hard but be healthier for him, and you need to make a plan for the coming years.", "NTA! It\u2019s high time your son grew up and accepted the consequences of his actions. Your wife is NOT helping! I\u2019ve lived through very similar situations and I have seen this nightmare up close.\n\nAnd he can save his BS excuses about being overqualified for restaurant work. Many (and I do mean MANY) servers hold degrees unrelated to the hospitality industry. It\u2019s actually kinda funny, but most of them make better bank serving in restaurants. And that\u2019s why they stay. Fun little tip about back of house restaurant workers: many of them have records. That doesn\u2019t stop them from being hired. It\u2019s kind of a given in the industry. My female relatives and friends who are servers often \u2018joke\u2019 to obnoxious male customers who won\u2019t stop trying to hit on them, that if they don\u2019t stop the harassment, they\u2019re gonna pull the cook out of the kitchen and he\u2019ll teach them some manners. \u201cMy cook adores me and he\u2019s not afraid to go back to jail.\u201d Works every time, Lol\n\nYour son is a lazy and manipulative mooch who has finally hit a wall. Too bad his mommy wants to help him tunnel through that wall, because she\u2019s the one who\u2019s gonna get the dirtiest and most ragged. He\u2019ll just suck her dry until he latches on to a new host. Parasites are like that.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You have the right attitude. Oh, and any 27 year old not living under a rock has seen hundreds if not thousands of cop shows (and true crime shows). He\u2019s a moron to NOT keep his mouth shut and to NOT ask for a lawyer. Sheesh!!!  Good luck.\n\nEDIT: added a sentence.", "Nta", "NTA. Your son needed to learn the consequences of his actions a long time ago", "NTA.

You and your wife have enabled this situation to happen.", "NTA - Buy stupid coins, get stupid prizes.", "YTA, but not for the question you're asking. Why the fuck would you try to blame this all on your wife? You're going to be an extremely lonely old man.", "NTA sounds like you use to cave in to your wife when she would make excuses for him and you followed along until it got to the point where you decided enough is enough. You gave him many chances and he messed around and found out. To any one who says it take two to enable are wrong. If your wife is complaining try again to explain he needs to accept the consequences of his actions. She needs to stop cuddling him he's 27 not 17 and even still if he's getting felony charges then there is more going on then just the theft. Let your wife know you love her but you are not going to support him this time. It has to end.", "ESH - save your money for your divorce attorney.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
