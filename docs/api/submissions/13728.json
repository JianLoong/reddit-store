There is a point you have to let people fend for themselves but you aren't there yet. He deserves a second chance doesn't he? Do you love him? Help him show him you care.

Esp. when your wife won't see it and be an enabler.   Rose coloured glasses and all.\n\nI too have a very close family member like this, and try as we all did to get him steered in the right direction for years, it didn't matter.  He stole from us, he lied to us, and the list is endless as we always gave him the benefit of the doubt, until we no longer could believe a word that came out of his mouth.   He's been back and forth in jail for various reasons (we never charged him, it was other things he did out of his own stupidity.)   It's been a few years now and we have gone no contact with him whatsoever.   It's sad, but I honestly can't say I miss the constant drama in my life.   Last time he reached out to me (2 yrs) he said he was homeless living out of his car.   I knew that wasn't true and simply told him that I was sorry for his situation, I can give you a few places you can go to and get help, funds, find a job, etc.   But no - he was just pulling heartstrings again.   He just wanted cash.   Told him no, and he told me to go f myself.   That was enough and he's been blocked since.   Thus he couldn't call me for help last fall when he was arrested again, and bail him out.   & the family he did call?   All refused.   He stayed in jail for mths.   Do I or any other member of my family feel bad?   No we don't, we just feel sad all around.    You can't help others if they don't want help.   Hard lesson, and I wish it on no-one.", "NTA.

So even children that haven't been exposed to trauma can feel that \"stress\" their predecessors have experienced across generations.
