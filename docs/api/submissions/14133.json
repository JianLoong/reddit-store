Thanks for all the comments, I did read as many as I could.\n\nI talked to my wife. I apologised for not telling her what my aunt had said, and that it was only because I believed what my aunt had said had no merit, and that she as my wife was always going to be my priority rather than placating them. She accepted my apology. She still was wary to try and confront them about it though, and I ended up saying something that I read in a comment that broke my heart - that my wife was probably more than anything grieving the loss of the new family she thought she was going to have. And she immediately burst into tears. So that commenter was spot on. Her parents went through a very bitter divorce that damaged their relationship with their children permanently. So it was a difficult conversation, but we came to the conclusion that we had to confront my mum and aunt in the hope of salvaging any relationship, though my wife wanted me to do it on our behalf (fair).\n\nI called my aunt and basically let her have it. She wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t repeat, so that was an immediate end to that relationship.\n\nI then called my mum to do the same, and she was very ashamed. For context, my aunt is her older sister, and we invited her because my mum and my wife wanted her there (my aunt had never met my wife, but my wife really wanted to meet my whole family). My mum grew up in a very conservative Christian household, and although she stopped believing, my aunt didn\u2019t, so there's been some distance and disappointment. My mum apologised to me and said she had been missing her sister and had let herself get brought back into \"old habits\". She wants the opportunity to make it up to my wife, but my wife and I have agreed on low contact for now, and we\u2019ll see how we go. My wife did say ok to flowers and a letter that my mum wanted to send, but I told my mum pretty sternly not to expect anything from my wife, which she took pretty well.\n\nMost importantly, my wife now seems to be a lot happier. I don\u2019t know if our relationship with my mum will be as trusting ever again, but it at least will be one with clear boundaries. Part of the reason for the delayed update is that, amidst all this, my wife realised she\u2019d missed her period, and lo and behold - she\u2019s pregnant! Cue panic because she drank at our wedding and this is totally unplanned, but otherwise we\u2019re ecstatic. We haven\u2019t told anyone other than her mother and sister, and now we\u2019re going to have to really think about how this is going to work with my mum, but I\u2019m now feeling way more confident that we\u2019ll be able to figure it out together. As long as my wife is happy, I don't care.", "created_utc": 1680789555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dl8bj/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_to_tone_down/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Thanks for the update, and more importantly, CONGRATULATIONS!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A baby! I'm so happy for you both. You sound like a great team and a great partner, and I read your original post and thought the same. Don't worry about aunt, doesn't sound like she was that invested to begin with. I'm glad your mom is making amends, but definitely keep quiet about the baby for 4-5 months, since she may start groveling only for grandmother's rights.", "OP, I just want to say you sound like a good husband who is shouldering new responsibilities while trying to honor the old.  I wish you the very best, and it sounds like you have the foundation of a relationship built around respect and communication.", "Congratulations\u2026..on all counts! Totally on the right track\u2026. Just in time too. Your mothers apology is a pointer in the right direction. Best wishes for the exciting times ahead.", "Thanks for the update and Congrats. Once again, communication is key.", "Congratulations and well done for stepping up to your frightful, bigoted, hate-filled, sour lemon of an aunt. She is clearly a lost cause but the relationship with your mum sounds like it might have some (eventual) potential. Good luck with that.\n\nI wonder how long it will be before the judgmental and critical horrors at your wedding start asking you, or probably others, about your new baby? Hmmm.\n\nAll the best to you both and please tell your wife not to stop dancing. At the next family function, it would be a good idea if you joined her. Imagine the outrage!!!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!! Try not to punish Mom forever.  She screwed up, and knows it.  Sorry about the aunt being what she is.", "You handled this beautifully. Thanks for the update, and congratulations!", "> She wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t repeat, so that was an immediate end to that relationship.\n\nIf you don't mind my curiosity, without asking for specific quotes, was it condescending \"Everyone who's not a stuck up Christian prude like me is the devil\" types of things? Or super fucking racist types of things? \n\nI ask because \u201ctone down the fiesta.\u201d from the last post was less a racism red flag and more a small industrious nation whose chief export is racism red flags.", "drinking before you\u2019re far enough along to know you\u2019re pregnant is no issue\u2014the placenta is what transmits alcohol to the baby and it doesn\u2019t develop until way later. nothing to worry about!", ">My mum apologised to me and said she had been missing her sister and had let herself get brought back into \"old habits\". She wants the opportunity to make it up to my wife, but my wife and I have agreed on low contact for now\n\n\nWait, why are you punishing your mom?  She not only apologized, she apparently wants to make it up to her, which to me says it's not just lip service. \n\nMaybe there's more to the story but I don't understand this leap.", "YTA. Obviously your aunt is as well, but it sounds like your mom was genuinely sorry and doing whatever she can to try to make up for her mistakes. Your punishment of her seems unjustified.", "TBH, I'm not sure why you're still so sour with your Mum. Just forgive her and move on. She seems genuinely sorry, everyone makes mistakes and it takes some courage to admit wrong and attempt reparations.", "Congratulations! You're a good partner and you're going to be a great dad and it sounds like your wife is going to be a wonderful mother. I'm glad to see this update because my heart was so sad for your wife. She was just enjoying her special day and she sounds like a blast to hang with lol", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!  I'm glad your wife is happier and and your marriage is going strong! :)", "Okay, best ending ever. I\u2019m so happy for you guys  that it brought a little tear to my eye because I want to badly to marry and have babies. Congratulations!", "BEST UPDATE", "Congratulations! I\u2019m glad you cut off your Aunt. I understand the impulse to go LC with your mom. I know your mom has to earn trust back, but given her apparent sincere regret and desire to make amends, I hope you\u2019ll give her a real chance to do that.", "Good for you!! I understand taking a breather from your mom. Her behavior was hurtful and damaging and people prefer to pretend that an apology erases damage instantly. It does not. A true apology may pave the way to repair, but time is often needed. \n\nCongratulations on the baby!!", "Congratulations", "Thank you for the updates :D i rmb reading this and feeling rly badly for yal (very NAH moment). Now happy for both u and ur wife", "CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You did the right thing by confronting your mom and aunt. Sorry it did not go well with your aunt.", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!! What wonderful news.", "Wow, congratulations!!  \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through that with the aunt but your mom does sound sincere.  Obviously, actions will speak louder than words and this situation should give you insight as the kind of boundaries you want to set forth with family as you move forward.  Thanks for the update!", "She participated in shit talking his wife at their wedding and some of those things were racist...all because her sister was there and she just \"fell right into the behavior\" becauae her sister was doing it. There definitely needs to be a cooling off period. I'm sorry isn't enough all the time. She didn't take their ball in the playground.", "They need time to rebuild trust. If his mom can respect their need for LC now and the interactions they do have go well, then they will likely feel better about not needing to put up that boundary anymore.", "An apology doesn't erase the hurt. His wife needs time, which is understandable.", "Yeah, that part got me too. It seems people just can\u2019t accept sincere apologies anymore.\n\nRegardless, OP was awesome for sticking up for his wife, both at the wedding and afterwards. Congratulations on the new baby!!", "I don't see it as punishment, I think it's going to be a little time for OP and his wife to feel comfortable with her again.  An apology doesn't always result in automatically forgetting what happened.  There are feelings that need to be sorted through, and I suspect that after some time it'll be OK, especially now that OPs Mom seems self-aware and isn't likely to repeat what was really pretty bad behavior.", ">I'm sorry isn't enough all the time\n\n\nRight, which is why the mom wants to do more to show she's actually apologetic lol.", "I had to re-read both posting to find racist things that were said.  Can you please enlighten me where the mom was involved in saying anything racist? The OP didn't even mention anything racist was said.\nSeems like everything is about race these days.  Oh, one of parties involved in the conflict is not white, BOOM, that's racist!", "And to add, an apology should also show change in behavior, they need time to see that.", "A sincere apology isn't some magic \"all the hurt is now gone\" spell. Yes, a genuine, thoughtful apology is a great way to mend some of the pain you put the other person through, but broken trust and feelings can take a while to mend-it takes continuous effort to back up that apology and repair what you damaged.", "I didn\u2019t suggest they forget. She wants to make it up to them, so why not give her the chance? OP\u2019s wife could have the good relationship with her that she wants.", "And they aren't ready. They don't owe her immediate forgiveness.", "The aunt said something along the lines of making his wife tone down the fiesta. She is Latina."]}
