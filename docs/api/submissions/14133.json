Thanks for all the comments, I did read as many as I could.\n\nI talked to my wife. I apologised for not telling her what my aunt had said, and that it was only because I believed what my aunt had said had no merit, and that she as my wife was always going to be my priority rather than placating them. She accepted my apology. She still was wary to try and confront them about it though, and I ended up saying something that I read in a comment that broke my heart - that my wife was probably more than anything grieving the loss of the new family she thought she was going to have. And she immediately burst into tears. So that commenter was spot on. Her parents went through a very bitter divorce that damaged their relationship with their children permanently. So it was a difficult conversation, but we came to the conclusion that we had to confront my mum and aunt in the hope of salvaging any relationship, though my wife wanted me to do it on our behalf (fair).\n\nI called my aunt and basically let her have it. She wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t repeat, so that was an immediate end to that relationship.\n\nI then called my mum to do the same, and she was very ashamed. For context, my aunt is her older sister, and we invited her because my mum and my wife wanted her there (my aunt had never met my wife, but my wife really wanted to meet my whole family). My mum grew up in a very conservative Christian household, and although she stopped believing, my aunt didn\u2019t, so there's been some distance and disappointment. My mum apologised to me and said she had been missing her sister and had let herself get brought back into \"old habits\". She wants the opportunity to make it up to my wife, but my wife and I have agreed on low contact for now, and we\u2019ll see how we go. My wife did say ok to flowers and a letter that my mum wanted to send, but I told my mum pretty sternly not to expect anything from my wife, which she took pretty well.\n\nMost importantly, my wife now seems to be a lot happier. I don\u2019t know if our relationship with my mum will be as trusting ever again, but it at least will be one with clear boundaries. Part of the reason for the delayed update is that, amidst all this, my wife realised she\u2019d missed her period, and lo and behold - she\u2019s pregnant! Cue panic because she drank at our wedding and this is totally unplanned, but otherwise we\u2019re ecstatic. We haven\u2019t told anyone other than her mother and sister, and now we\u2019re going to have to really think about how this is going to work with my mum, but I\u2019m now feeling way more confident that we\u2019ll be able to figure it out together. As long as my wife is happy, I don't care.", "created_utc": 1680789555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dl8bj/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_to_tone_down/", "score": 3189, "replies": ["Thanks for the update, and more importantly, CONGRATULATIONS!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A baby! I'm so happy for you both. You sound like a great team and a great partner, and I read your original post and thought the same.

I'm glad your mom is making amends, but definitely keep quiet about the baby for 4-5 months, since she may start groveling only for grandmother's rights.", "OP, I just want to say you sound like a good husband who is shouldering new responsibilities while trying to honor the old.  I wish you the very best, and it sounds like you have the foundation of a relationship built around respect and communication.", "Congratulations\u2026..on all counts! Totally on the right track\u2026. Just in time too. Your mothers apology is a pointer in the right direction. Best wishes for the exciting times ahead.", "Thanks for the update and Congrats. Once again, communication is key.", "Congratulations and well done for stepping up to your frightful, bigoted, hate-filled, sour lemon of an aunt. She is clearly a lost cause but the relationship with your mum sounds like it might have some (eventual) potential. Good luck with that.\n\nI wonder how long it will be before the judgmental and critical horrors at your wedding start asking you, or probably others, about your new baby? Hmmm.\n\nAll the best to you both and please tell your wife not to stop dancing. At the next family function, it would be a good idea if you joined her. Imagine the outrage!!!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!! Try not to punish Mom forever.  She screwed up, and knows it.  Sorry about the aunt being what she is.", "You handled this beautifully. Thanks for the update, and congratulations!", "> She wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t repeat, so that was an immediate end to that relationship.\n\nIf you don't mind my curiosity, without asking for specific quotes, was it condescending \"Everyone who's not a stuck up Christian prude like me is the devil\" types of things?

She not only apologized, she apparently wants to make it up to her, which to me says it's not just lip service. \n\nMaybe there's more to the story but I don't understand this leap.", "YTA. Obviously your aunt is as well, but it sounds like your mom was genuinely sorry and doing whatever she can to try to make up for her mistakes. Your punishment of her seems unjustified.", "TBH, I'm not sure why you're still so sour with your Mum. Just forgive her and move on. She seems genuinely sorry, everyone makes mistakes and it takes some courage to admit wrong and attempt reparations.", "Congratulations! You're a good partner and you're going to be a great dad and it sounds like your wife is going to be a wonderful mother. I'm glad to see this update because my heart was so sad for your wife.

I\u2019m so happy for you guys  that it brought a little tear to my eye because I want to badly to marry and have babies. Congratulations!", "BEST UPDATE", "Congratulations! I\u2019m glad you cut off your Aunt. I understand the impulse to go LC with your mom. I know your mom has to earn trust back, but given her apparent sincere regret and desire to make amends, I hope you\u2019ll give her a real chance to do that.", "Good for you!! I understand taking a breather from your mom. Her behavior was hurtful and damaging and people prefer to pretend that an apology erases damage instantly. It does not. A true apology may pave the way to repair, but time is often needed. \n\nCongratulations on the baby!!", "Congratulations", "Thank you for the updates :D i rmb reading this and feeling rly badly for yal (very NAH moment). Now happy for both u and ur wife", "CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You did the right thing by confronting your mom and aunt. Sorry it did not go well with your aunt.", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!! What wonderful news.", "Wow, congratulations!!  \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through that with the aunt but your mom does sound sincere.  Obviously, actions will speak louder than words and this situation should give you insight as the kind of boundaries you want to set forth with family as you move forward.  Thanks for the update!", "She participated in shit talking his wife at their wedding and some of those things were racist...all because her sister was there and she just \"fell right into the behavior\" becauae her sister was doing it. There definitely needs to be a cooling off period. I'm sorry isn't enough all the time. She didn't take their ball in the playground.", "They need time to rebuild trust. If his mom can respect their need for LC now and the interactions they do have go well, then they will likely feel better about not needing to put up that boundary anymore.", "An apology doesn't erase the hurt. His wife needs time, which is understandable.", "Yeah, that part got me too. It seems people just can\u2019t accept sincere apologies anymore.\n\nRegardless, OP was awesome for sticking up for his wife, both at the wedding and afterwards. Congratulations on the new baby!!", "I don't see it as punishment, I think it's going to be a little time for OP and his wife to feel comfortable with her again.  An apology doesn't always result in automatically forgetting what happened.  There are feelings that need to be sorted through, and I suspect that after some time it'll be OK, especially now that OPs Mom seems self-aware and isn't likely to repeat what was really pretty bad behavior.", ">I'm sorry isn't enough all the time\n\n\nRight, which is why the mom wants to do more to show she's actually apologetic lol.", "I had to re-read both posting to find racist things that were said.  Can you please enlighten me where the mom was involved in saying anything racist? The OP didn't even mention anything racist was said.\nSeems like everything is about race these days.  Oh, one of parties involved in the conflict is not white, BOOM, that's racist!", "And to add, an apology should also show change in behavior, they need time to see that.", "A sincere apology isn't some magic \"all the hurt is now gone\" spell. Yes, a genuine, thoughtful apology is a great way to mend some of the pain you put the other person through, but broken trust and feelings can take a while to mend-it takes continuous effort to back up that apology and repair what you damaged.", "I didn\u2019t suggest they forget. She wants to make it up to them, so why not give her the chance? OP\u2019s wife could have the good relationship with her that she wants.", "And they aren't ready. They don't owe her immediate forgiveness.", "The aunt said something along the lines of making his wife tone down the fiesta. She is Latina.", "Congrats my guy but I\u2019d say try not punish mom forver she atleast knows she messed up", "Congrats", "Congrats!", "I think you handled that wonderfully. Your wife danced joyfully and unreserved because she thought she was \"safe\" to joyfully be herself with the people surrounding her, instead she received judgment and criticism from someone she went out of her way to ensure was invited and from her brand-new MIL. I am very impressed with your handling of this entire situation, because here on Reddit that isn't what we normally see.", "Congratulations! Also no need to panic. Drink until it's pink! Plenty of people drink before finding out about being pregnant, as it's too early to really send anything to little bean yet.", "If it makes you feel any better, I can't stop saying \"tone down the fesita\" to my toddler now.", "Congratulations", "You totally handled this situation like a rockstar. I\u2019m also really happy that your mom is apologetic and has shown remorse. It\u2019s really promising for her future relationship with your family. I wish you and your wife (and baby) the best!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! you are a lovely human.", "I\u2019m glad to hear you are both doing well.", "Lovely. You did this all with dignity and courage. What a supportive way to start off your marriage. Good for you both. I hope you can continue to heal that relationship.", "Congrats!\n\nAnd I'm glad you are on the way to mending things with your mom. The dynamics with older siblings can be tricky - even as an adult you can fall back into bad shit when you are with family. I'm glad you are showing grace in this situation. Sounds like your mom got sucked into her sister's shitty beliefs (that she was also brought up with) and has realized that was a huge mistake.", "Congratulations, dad.  \nLooks like you and your wife are going to have a new, wonderful, loving (if exhausting) family soon", "Huge congrats, OP. It\u2019s so heartwarming to see some positive results of this sub, and it sounds like you handled this beautifully! I hope this strengthens your relationship with your wife and wish both of you well. Massive W", "You're a great guy the way you're stepping up for your wife. And your wife is really nice, trying to avoid confrontation with your family to avoid any friction.\n\nYou're a wonderful couple. Congratulations on your wedding, and congratulations on the baby!", "Wonderful update!", "Congratulations \ud83c\udf89. I think with the mother will work out. She wants to meet her grandchildren I'm sure.", "Awesome update, I'm glad you were able to talk to your wife and came to the conclusion together that you needed to draw these boundaries.  \n\nCongratulations and hope all goes well with the pregnancy!", "CONGRATULATIONS!! What a lovely surprise in the midst of all this family drama. You handled this beautifully, and you and your wife are lucky to have each other.\n\nHere\u2019s to new beginnings with your growing family!", "My wife is a wedding photographer and I assist at most weddings. The Brides that go hog wild dancing in a fun way tend be the best wives and happiest couples.   \nYour aunt probably has a boring marriage and feels ugly.", "What a good update aside from aunt. Congrats to you both expecting a little one. So exciting! Hope things continue to get better with your mom, and she makes the right choices.", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!  \nYou and your wife sound like lovely people who know how to productively talk about difficult things with love. You\u2019ll be great parents!!!", "Mom might have some relationship issues if she's willing to let her sis control her like that. Honestly it would be best to keep them two away from each other for moms well being", "Awesome and congrats 1q", "Congrats on the baby and what sounds like a good outcome! Thank you for the update!", "Congratulations, I hope your wife has a safe and easy pregnancy.", "OP congrats on the positive outcome and congrats on the baby. Do not worry, my wife realized that she was pregnant about 6 weeks in and drank before it. Our kid turned out pretty damn great. So don't stress to much about that.", "Congratulations for the baby \ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a nd ur really a good husband..ur wife is really lucky\ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd17", "Congrats.\n\nIt sounds like the aunt rightfully got cut off. She won't change. \n\nDon't be too hard on your mom and cut her off too long that the relationship is irreparable. This would be contradictory to your wife's initial thoughts about being family. Your moms apology sounds sincere and as you said it, she knew she messed up. She didnt even try to defend herself or sister so she knows she was wrong and tried to make it right. \n\nFor a parent to do this says volumes. Gosh my mother has done 10x worse and would rather eat dirt than apologise. I think had your aunt not been there, your mom would never have given the dancing a second thought. It sounds like your aunt can be manipulative and your mom let her guard down just being excited to see her sister. I think given a chance your mom and wife could have a good relationship. Don't be too rash to write it off.", "This is a great update! It's good to hear that your mom was appropriately ashamed and apologetic. I think a lot of people sometimes don't even realize how much influence their older siblings have on them so I find her explanation believable and while it doesn't make her behavior okay at all I think it leaves room for a lot of hope that you guys can work things out in the future.\n\nIt's always great to read about someone who really has their partner's back and the way you both really listened to each other on this and talked it through makes me think you're off to a great start as spouses and parents. Best of luck on your new adventure!", "Congratulations to you and your wife!!", "Congratulations! Has to be one of the best endings to an update. Wishing you, your wife and future child/ren all the best.", "> and lo and behold - she\u2019s pregnant!\n\nUpvoted for \u201clo and behold\u201d without the \u2018w\u2019 in \u2018low\u2019.\n\nOh, and congratulations!", "That's great, congratulations in becoming new parents. \n\nAs for you aunt, doesn't sound like she deserved to be in your life but she may come around for a baby. \n\nAs for your mom it doesn't sound like she meant to be hurtful and she went along with the aunt so as to not lose her sister. \n\nKind of like those friendships where you just go along with the mean girl, even if you don't agree because you dont want to lose your friends. \n\nLow contact is good, but I wouldn't go too low, and instead work on the relationship. Talk, maybe have family therapy, or do things together that show she didn't mean to hurt people. \n\nI would also see if your wife is up to having small get togethers with your mom. Like lunch, or picking out some new dishes or something. This will help gage whether your mom is really sorry or just trying to sweep it under the rug. \n\nYou could definitely wait till after the 1st semester to say anything about the baby to see how she handles working on the relationship. \n\nSomeone people go low contact and ignore attempts when people reach out. I wouldn't ignore your mom, as her reaching out shows that she's sorry and wants to be better, to have a relationship and at least she is sorry and is trying to be better.", "So glad you talked and worked it out. And congrats!!!", "Happy wife, happy life \ud83d\ude0e", "This update is amazing!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope it's triples - just kidding.", "I think this is one if my most favorite updates.", "The number of couples I know who were unknowingly pregnant at their wedding or a friend\u2019s wedding and were incredibly drunk during the celebrations is remarkably high. \ud83e\udd23 \n\nAll those babies turned out perfectly, no issues and are gigantic and smart little kids haha.", "Much more pressing issue is folic acid: OP your wife needs to start prenatal vitamins today! Congratulations!", "Kicking the aunt out of their life seems like a win not a loss I have to say.", "What xopranaut said!", "My worry is that punishing the mom is also punishing OP's wife. Wife wants a good familial relationship and even though it's GOOD that she didn't sacrifice a part of herself for it as she was initially willing to do, I would imagine she still wants it. I don't know exactly how it went down but it sounds a little like OP talked her into the LC. Given that mom is fully repentant, I hope that the LC doesn't last too long and they can end up with a mutually fulfilling relationship, minus AH Aunt.", "Trust is not magically restored by a single apology. \n\nMom demonstrated that certain family members still have quite a lot of influence over her behavior, and it will take time for her to prove that she\u2019s not going to lash out again in order to curry favor with her sister. And the stakes are even higher now that OP and his wife are expecting a child. They are correct to be cautious.", "Apparently my fianc\u00e9e was already a few weeks pregnant when we went to carnival and got absolutely blasted. We didn't find out until we got back home, lol.

So depending on where the drinking falls in a cycle quite a few women are pregnant during their wedding. But nothing counts until 6 weeks for blood sharing so it\u2019s fine haha. \n\nIt\u2019s actually how a lot of women figure out they\u2019re pregnant, too. \u201cWhy won\u2019t this hangover go away?!\u201d well, because it\u2019s not a hangover. \ud83e\udd23", "I understand you didn't suggest that.\n\nOften, people think because they apologize that it means all will be well right away.

You have both built an amazing foundation for a relationship and a marriage.\nAbout the whole racist things, I'm afraid this will be your life from now on.

And that's just at the top of my head. Just to say, be prepared to hear the most absurd things about Hispanic people. Just try to find the fun side. It will get easier with time. Oh, and also expect to get sung \"despacito\" and \"la macarena\" when someone hears you speak Spanish.", "Wow! Congratulations on your marriage, your wedding (which sounded like a real blast) and your wife's pregnancy. You guys must be walking on air! The drinking at the wedding is very unlikely to be significant.\n\n\"Tone down the fiesta\" sounds pretty racist. Seems like you're both better off without your aunt. Perhaps you both will be able to patch it up somewhat with mom in the near future, but it's totally normal and fine if your first loyalty is to your wife. Glad to hear she's feeling supported and happier.\n\nYour original AITA reminded me of when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was first elected as a US Representative from New York's 14th Congressional district in 2018. Her political opposition tried to shame her by posting pictures of her dancing when she was a college undergraduate. She looked like a college kid enjoying herself while dancing on a rooftop with a bunch of her classmates. I guess some people just can't stand to see a Latina having a good time.", "First, CONGRATULATIONS! I didn't get around to reading the first post til now.\n\nSecond, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN! Should I pass out cigars? =-3\n\n\nThird, I am glad your mother was conciliatory and I hope things work out there. Your aunt sounds pretty awful though so I think that one is going to be a write off XD", "Thank you for this lovely update. I wish you, your wife and your child all the happiness.", "Congratulations!\n\nAnd don't worry about the drinking at the wedding. Your doc will tell you it's not an issue and pretty much EVERYONE drinks (and worse) in the beginning of pregnancy when they dont know they are pregnant.", "Ah, you're so lovely. Your wife sounds incredible and I understand her wanting to know - don't ever shut her down, you did so right in the moment - but tell her on the way home and explain your reason so she's not caught off guard ever.\n\nIt sounds like your Mum wants to please the loudest voice, low contact is a good idea because she'll see you two are solid and happy. One day she might realise her mistakes properly and that relationship might be okay, but only if you two are okay with it.\n\nGood luck and thank you for a positive relationship anecdote that reminds people there are couples that love each other and respect each other so much! \ud83d\udda4", "Congratulations! Forgive your Mom and let her send flowers and a letter. Flowers in your home will be very nice!", "May your child grow up to have the strong spirit of the mother and the strength and compassion of the father. Congratulations.", "Congratulations, and good on you for standing with your wife!!!  The way you handled this situation after absorbing the feedback makes you very much NTA.", "This update brought tears to my eyes. You are a great husband and soon to be amazing father, congratulations! Sounds like you handled this very well and your wife feels heard and validated in her feelings. Cheers to many many happy years together", "Congratulations!  Don\u2019t worry about the alcohol\u2014I drank at a friend\u2019s wedding the weekend before I found out I was pregnant with my daughter.  She is fine and now has her own daughter.", "I had to pop over and read part 1 of the. You did the right thig and you are NTA, I would have been way worse then you were to them for saying shit like that. Congrats on the new baby, God Bless you and your new family!", "This is the sweetest update OP and congratulations on your and your wife\u2019s pending family member!", "Nothing but the best wishes for you both. I hope you have a beautiful life filled with joy and love. Love you guys \u2764\ufe0f", "Awww this gave me goosebumps, especially \"as long as my wife is happy, I don't care.\"  That's the foundation that will help the two of you figure it out together.  As someone who grew up super religious I empathize with your mom, old habits die hard, and hopefully with some time of low contact and standing firm together on boundaries, you and your wifes relationship with your mom can regain some trust.\n\nAlso CONGRATULATIONS!!  How exciting!!!  Also, I found out I was pregnant at 6weeks- total surprise, and I had drank a couple nights in the weeks prior before I knew and it was okay- my daughter is 15 now with no health issues at all.  I wish the best for you and your growing family!!", "Congratulations on marriage! Congratulations on pending parenthood! And Congratulations on early conflict resolution within your new family. You two are going to do great.", "This is one of my favorite updates on here. Congratulations!", "If it were me dancing, I\u2019d post it on TikTok and send the link to all the snooty relatives. Now that would be funny.", "Way to go!", "For some reason it seems kinda great he told strangers in the internet first\u2026 congratulations!!!", "I found out both times I was pregnant when I was hungover, both my little ones are healthy and happy so your comment is spot on!", "yeah, when I found out I was pregnant, I had been feeling really tired for a week and thought nothing of it. Went to my sisters for a family thing on a Sunday and had a couple of beers. That night, I was laying in bed and thought OH SHIT. I'm late. I would get my period on the Sunday it was due like clock work. A few days later, I took the test and it was positive. I estimated I was two weeks along, per the nurse, I was four weeks along on how they count it, but it was fine. I didn't drink after that obvi.", "Yes, if apologizing earnestly, seeing the issue and agreeing to fix it doesn\u2019t mend relationships, then what\u2019s the point of all this human interaction stuff? People mess up, sometimes badly. You gotta spot those who are honest about their apologies and give them a chance again.", "Yeah this is the only thing I didn\u2019t agree with - I think if mom is genuinely remorseful about the ordeal OP\u2019s wife should accept the olive branch and have a hat with her.", "If I had to guess, some racism, xenophobia and a healthy splash of slut-shaming was her magical recipe. Mix together and voila! No contact!", "Because this sub insists on going no contact with anyone you've ever had a disagreement with.", "Indeed. \nMy sister and her husband went to a friend's wedding, with a hotel room, and got tuned up! Then they were chuckling about how they needed supervision. Turned out they'd planted their new chaperone that weekend as well. 10 months later, a late night of partying didn't seem inviting at all.", "... did we read the same update? Because it sounds like he had the conversations he needed to with the appropriate parties and adjusted his relationships with them accordingly\n\nOP, congratufuckinglations and I'm proud of you and your family unit that's only growing from here!", "I see what you\u2019re saying and it should be obvious but that\u2019s Reddit for you sometimes. I expected OP to confront them but not burn the house down and he was going to do it it to his Mom too but she apologized. They are going low contact bcuz of this?! Mrs. OP needs to stop projecting, this is not her birth family, all that matters now is OP and now their new addition to their family, the baby. I don\u2019t even think OP should\u2019ve apologized to his wife for not telling her. I am guessing if OP had done this she would\u2019ve wished he would\u2019ve waited or something to the like. I doubt she would\u2019ve been happy if he did do that and would\u2019ve probably put her in an uncheery mood on one of the best nights of her life.", "True, but some wounds just don\u2019t go away with \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "The aunt warranted a discussion at the original incident, not avoiding it and walking away with her expecting some action or resolution on his part.   \n   \nThen in his own words op called the aunt and \u201clet her have it.\u201d  Which is unneccessary.  How about - \u2018we come from different cultures, she certainly didnt mean to offend.  We hope to spend more time together in the future as a family.\u2019?   \n   \nAnd then he calls and makes mom feel guilty by association but also we are much too fragile to receive an apology gift, too.   \n    \n*all* of this - wifes unhappiness and friction with the family could have been avoided if op simply had a backbone.   \n   \nthis sub gets off on people overreacting and burning bridges over nonsense.", "I don't mind a few downvotes, but thank you for the sanity check here.", "Nah, I'm not going to fault OP for wanting to avoid conflict at his own fucking wedding and for being upset when he called his aunt. It sounds like his aunt is a judgmental prick, and **did** mean to offend, or at the very least gave negative fucks that she did offend someone. Why the hell is he obligated to spend more time with someone who's as negative as his aunt has been?\n\nI fully support burning bridges with seemingly racist assholes like the aunt seems to be, and will supply the gasoline and match to let it on fire. I don't care if you think it's wrong for me/the sub to react that way, but it's perfectly reasonable to decide you don't want to associate with assholes anymore\n\nPS racism, however dogwhistle, is not nonsense, and honestly, you're TA for suggesting it is\n\n**ETA: from the original post this post is updating us on: \"The morning after, we had breakfast with my family and my aunt mentioned to my wife that she was pleased that I eventually got her to \u201ctone down the fiesta.\u201d\" Hence, I referred to his aunt's racism, because comments like that are textbook dogwhistle racism**", "\n\noh god, this is hilarious, haha", "are you drunk?  Where did i mention racism ANYwhere?  Im half spanish you fucking donut.  Nowhere did i imply racism had anything to do with any of this.   \nedit: op reworded their comment now", "My nephew\u2019s middle name is Julio after his mother\u2019s grandfather. We call him *Don* Julio because it\u2019s responsible for his conception.", "From the original post: \"The morning after, we had breakfast with my family and my aunt mentioned to my wife that she was pleased that I eventually got her to \u201ctone down the fiesta.\u201d\"\n\nAunt is racist, fuck her and burn that bridge to the ground\n\nAs for you, I'd recommend you'd read the posts you're responding to before you take up as internet defender for someone", "lol.  idk what people would do if ever confronted with *actual* racism.   \n   \nwas the comment tasteless?  Absolutely.   \n   \nwas it racist?  only if you are looking for it to be.  \n   \nim convinced the majority of commenters here simply need to go outside and breathe fresh air.", "Yeah, I'm going to stop engaging with you after this comment. When your family member is using microaggressions to refer to your half Spanish wife and making snide comments like this, you have absolutely no obligation to maintain a relationship with them, much less approach them with the respect they seem unable to give your spouse\n\nIf you're willing to excuse comments like this because they're not racist enough for you, congratulations I guess for being more forgiving than I am. Doesn't make the comments or the person less racist, and I'm going to support OP's decision to go NC with her, just like I plan on going NC with you\n\nI hope you have the day that you deserve"]}
