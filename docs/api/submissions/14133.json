Thanks for all the comments, I did read as many as I could.\n\nI talked to my wife. I apologised for not telling her what my aunt had said, and that it was only because I believed what my aunt had said had no merit, and that she as my wife was always going to be my priority rather than placating them. She accepted my apology. She still was wary to try and confront them about it though, and I ended up saying something that I read in a comment that broke my heart - that my wife was probably more than anything grieving the loss of the new family she thought she was going to have. And she immediately burst into tears. So that commenter was spot on. Her parents went through a very bitter divorce that damaged their relationship with their children permanently. So it was a difficult conversation, but we came to the conclusion that we had to confront my mum and aunt in the hope of salvaging any relationship, though my wife wanted me to do it on our behalf (fair).\n\nI called my aunt and basically let her have it. She wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t repeat, so that was an immediate end to that relationship.\n\nI then called my mum to do the same, and she was very ashamed. For context, my aunt is her older sister, and we invited her because my mum and my wife wanted her there (my aunt had never met my wife, but my wife really wanted to meet my whole family). My mum grew up in a very conservative Christian household, and although she stopped believing, my aunt didn\u2019t, so there's been some distance and disappointment. My mum apologised to me and said she had been missing her sister and had let herself get brought back into \"old habits\". She wants the opportunity to make it up to my wife, but my wife and I have agreed on low contact for now, and we\u2019ll see how we go. My wife did say ok to flowers and a letter that my mum wanted to send, but I told my mum pretty sternly not to expect anything from my wife, which she took pretty well.\n\nMost importantly, my wife now seems to be a lot happier. I don\u2019t know if our relationship with my mum will be as trusting ever again, but it at least will be one with clear boundaries. Part of the reason for the delayed update is that, amidst all this, my wife realised she\u2019d missed her period, and lo and behold - she\u2019s pregnant! Cue panic because she drank at our wedding and this is totally unplanned, but otherwise we\u2019re ecstatic. We haven\u2019t told anyone other than her mother and sister, and now we\u2019re going to have to really think about how this is going to work with my mum, but I\u2019m now feeling way more confident that we\u2019ll be able to figure it out together. As long as my wife is happy, I don't care.", "created_utc": 1680789555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dl8bj/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_to_tone_down/", "score": 1159, "replies": ["Thanks for the update, and more importantly, CONGRATULATIONS!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A baby! I'm so happy for you both. You sound like a great team and a great partner, and I read your original post and thought the same. Don't worry about aunt, doesn't sound like she was that invested to begin with. I'm glad your mom is making amends, but definitely keep quiet about the baby for 4-5 months, since she may start groveling only for grandmother's rights.", "OP, I just want to say you sound like a good husband who is shouldering new responsibilities while trying to honor the old.  I wish you the very best, and it sounds like you have the foundation of a relationship built around respect and communication.", "Congratulations\u2026..on all counts! Totally on the right track\u2026. Just in time too. Your mothers apology is a pointer in the right direction. Best wishes for the exciting times ahead.", "Thanks for the update and Congrats. Once again, communication is key.", "Congratulations and well done for stepping up to your frightful, bigoted, hate-filled, sour lemon of an aunt. She is clearly a lost cause but the relationship with your mum sounds like it might have some (eventual) potential. Good luck with that.\n\nI wonder how long it will be before the judgmental and critical horrors at your wedding start asking you, or probably others, about your new baby? Hmmm.\n\nAll the best to you both and please tell your wife not to stop dancing. At the next family function, it would be a good idea if you joined her. Imagine the outrage!!!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!! Try not to punish Mom forever.  She screwed up, and knows it.  Sorry about the aunt being what she is.", "You handled this beautifully. Thanks for the update, and congratulations!", "> She wasn\u2019t apologetic at all and said some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t repeat, so that was an immediate end to that relationship.\n\nIf you don't mind my curiosity, without asking for specific quotes, was it condescending \"Everyone who's not a stuck up Christian prude like me is the devil\" types of things? Or super fucking racist types of things? \n\nI ask because \u201ctone down the fiesta.\u201d from the last post was less a racism red flag and more a small industrious nation whose chief export is racism red flags.", "drinking before you\u2019re far enough along to know you\u2019re pregnant is no issue\u2014the placenta is what transmits alcohol to the baby and it doesn\u2019t develop until way later. nothing to worry about!", ">My mum apologised to me and said she had been missing her sister and had let herself get brought back into \"old habits\". She wants the opportunity to make it up to my wife, but my wife and I have agreed on low contact for now\n\n\nWait, why are you punishing your mom?  She not only apologized, she apparently wants to make it up to her, which to me says it's not just lip service. \n\nMaybe there's more to the story but I don't understand this leap.", "YTA. Obviously your aunt is as well, but it sounds like your mom was genuinely sorry and doing whatever she can to try to make up for her mistakes. Your punishment of her seems unjustified.", "TBH, I'm not sure why you're still so sour with your Mum. Just forgive her and move on. She seems genuinely sorry, everyone makes mistakes and it takes some courage to admit wrong and attempt reparations.", "Congratulations! You're a good partner and you're going to be a great dad and it sounds like your wife is going to be a wonderful mother. I'm glad to see this update because my heart was so sad for your wife. She was just enjoying her special day and she sounds like a blast to hang with lol", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!  I'm glad your wife is happier and and your marriage is going strong! :)", "Okay, best ending ever. I\u2019m so happy for you guys  that it brought a little tear to my eye because I want to badly to marry and have babies. Congratulations!", "BEST UPDATE", "Congratulations! I\u2019m glad you cut off your Aunt. I understand the impulse to go LC with your mom. I know your mom has to earn trust back, but given her apparent sincere regret and desire to make amends, I hope you\u2019ll give her a real chance to do that.", "Good for you!! I understand taking a breather from your mom. Her behavior was hurtful and damaging and people prefer to pretend that an apology erases damage instantly. It does not. A true apology may pave the way to repair, but time is often needed. \n\nCongratulations on the baby!!", "Congratulations", "Thank you for the updates :D i rmb reading this and feeling rly badly for yal (very NAH moment). Now happy for both u and ur wife", "CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You did the right thing by confronting your mom and aunt. Sorry it did not go well with your aunt.", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!! What wonderful news.", "Wow, congratulations!!  \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through that with the aunt but your mom does sound sincere.  Obviously, actions will speak louder than words and this situation should give you insight as the kind of boundaries you want to set forth with family as you move forward.  Thanks for the update!", "She participated in shit talking his wife at their wedding and some of those things were racist...all because her sister was there and she just \"fell right into the behavior\" becauae her sister was doing it. There definitely needs to be a cooling off period. I'm sorry isn't enough all the time. She didn't take their ball in the playground.", "They need time to rebuild trust. If his mom can respect their need for LC now and the interactions they do have go well, then they will likely feel better about not needing to put up that boundary anymore.", "An apology doesn't erase the hurt. His wife needs time, which is understandable.", "Yeah, that part got me too. It seems people just can\u2019t accept sincere apologies anymore.\n\nRegardless, OP was awesome for sticking up for his wife, both at the wedding and afterwards. Congratulations on the new baby!!", "I don't see it as punishment, I think it's going to be a little time for OP and his wife to feel comfortable with her again.  An apology doesn't always result in automatically forgetting what happened.  There are feelings that need to be sorted through, and I suspect that after some time it'll be OK, especially now that OPs Mom seems self-aware and isn't likely to repeat what was really pretty bad behavior.", ">I'm sorry isn't enough all the time\n\n\nRight, which is why the mom wants to do more to show she's actually apologetic lol.", "I had to re-read both posting to find racist things that were said.  Can you please enlighten me where the mom was involved in saying anything racist? The OP didn't even mention anything racist was said.\nSeems like everything is about race these days.  Oh, one of parties involved in the conflict is not white, BOOM, that's racist!", "And to add, an apology should also show change in behavior, they need time to see that.", "A sincere apology isn't some magic \"all the hurt is now gone\" spell. Yes, a genuine, thoughtful apology is a great way to mend some of the pain you put the other person through, but broken trust and feelings can take a while to mend-it takes continuous effort to back up that apology and repair what you damaged.", "I didn\u2019t suggest they forget. She wants to make it up to them, so why not give her the chance? OP\u2019s wife could have the good relationship with her that she wants.", "And they aren't ready. They don't owe her immediate forgiveness.", "The aunt said something along the lines of making his wife tone down the fiesta. She is Latina.", "Congrats my guy but I\u2019d say try not punish mom forver she atleast knows she messed up", "Congrats", "Congrats!", "I think you handled that wonderfully. Your wife danced joyfully and unreserved because she thought she was \"safe\" to joyfully be herself with the people surrounding her, instead she received judgment and criticism from someone she went out of her way to ensure was invited and from her brand-new MIL. I am very impressed with your handling of this entire situation, because here on Reddit that isn't what we normally see.", "Congratulations! Also no need to panic. Drink until it's pink! Plenty of people drink before finding out about being pregnant, as it's too early to really send anything to little bean yet.", "If it makes you feel any better, I can't stop saying \"tone down the fesita\" to my toddler now.", "Congratulations", "You totally handled this situation like a rockstar. I\u2019m also really happy that your mom is apologetic and has shown remorse. It\u2019s really promising for her future relationship with your family. I wish you and your wife (and baby) the best!", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! you are a lovely human.", "I\u2019m glad to hear you are both doing well.", "Lovely. You did this all with dignity and courage. What a supportive way to start off your marriage. Good for you both. I hope you can continue to heal that relationship.", "Congrats!\n\nAnd I'm glad you are on the way to mending things with your mom. The dynamics with older siblings can be tricky - even as an adult you can fall back into bad shit when you are with family. I'm glad you are showing grace in this situation. Sounds like your mom got sucked into her sister's shitty beliefs (that she was also brought up with) and has realized that was a huge mistake.", "Congratulations, dad.  \nLooks like you and your wife are going to have a new, wonderful, loving (if exhausting) family soon", "Huge congrats, OP. It\u2019s so heartwarming to see some positive results of this sub, and it sounds like you handled this beautifully! I hope this strengthens your relationship with your wife and wish both of you well. Massive W", "You're a great guy the way you're stepping up for your wife. And your wife is really nice, trying to avoid confrontation with your family to avoid any friction.\n\nYou're a wonderful couple. Congratulations on your wedding, and congratulations on the baby!", "Wonderful update!", "Congratulations \ud83c\udf89. I think with the mother will work out. She wants to meet her grandchildren I'm sure.", "Awesome update, I'm glad you were able to talk to your wife and came to the conclusion together that you needed to draw these boundaries.  \n\nCongratulations and hope all goes well with the pregnancy!", "CONGRATULATIONS!! What a lovely surprise in the midst of all this family drama. You handled this beautifully, and you and your wife are lucky to have each other.\n\nHere\u2019s to new beginnings with your growing family!", "My wife is a wedding photographer and I assist at most weddings. The Brides that go hog wild dancing in a fun way tend be the best wives and happiest couples.   \nYour aunt probably has a boring marriage and feels ugly.", "What a good update aside from aunt. Congrats to you both expecting a little one. So exciting! Hope things continue to get better with your mom, and she makes the right choices.", "CONGRATULATIONS!!!  \nYou and your wife sound like lovely people who know how to productively talk about difficult things with love. You\u2019ll be great parents!!!", "Mom might have some relationship issues if she's willing to let her sis control her like that. Honestly it would be best to keep them two away from each other for moms well being", "Awesome and congrats 1q", "Congrats on the baby and what sounds like a good outcome! Thank you for the update!", "Congratulations, I hope your wife has a safe and easy pregnancy.", "OP congrats on the positive outcome and congrats on the baby. Do not worry, my wife realized that she was pregnant about 6 weeks in and drank before it. Our kid turned out pretty damn great. So don't stress to much about that.", "Congratulations for the baby \ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a nd ur really a good husband..ur wife is really lucky\ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd17", "Congrats.\n\nIt sounds like the aunt rightfully got cut off. She won't change. \n\nDon't be too hard on your mom and cut her off too long that the relationship is irreparable. This would be contradictory to your wife's initial thoughts about being family. Your moms apology sounds sincere and as you said it, she knew she messed up. She didnt even try to defend herself or sister so she knows she was wrong and tried to make it right. \n\nFor a parent to do this says volumes. Gosh my mother has done 10x worse and would rather eat dirt than apologise. I think had your aunt not been there, your mom would never have given the dancing a second thought. It sounds like your aunt can be manipulative and your mom let her guard down just being excited to see her sister. I think given a chance your mom and wife could have a good relationship. Don't be too rash to write it off.", "This is a great update! It's good to hear that your mom was appropriately ashamed and apologetic. I think a lot of people sometimes don't even realize how much influence their older siblings have on them so I find her explanation believable and while it doesn't make her behavior okay at all I think it leaves room for a lot of hope that you guys can work things out in the future.\n\nIt's always great to read about someone who really has their partner's back and the way you both really listened to each other on this and talked it through makes me think you're off to a great start as spouses and parents. Best of luck on your new adventure!", "Congratulations to you and your wife!!", "Congratulations! Has to be one of the best endings to an update. Wishing you, your wife and future child/ren all the best.", "> and lo and behold - she\u2019s pregnant!\n\nUpvoted for \u201clo and behold\u201d without the \u2018w\u2019 in \u2018low\u2019.\n\nOh, and congratulations!", "That's great, congratulations in becoming new parents. \n\nAs for you aunt, doesn't sound like she deserved to be in your life but she may come around for a baby. \n\nAs for your mom it doesn't sound like she meant to be hurtful and she went along with the aunt so as to not lose her sister. \n\nKind of like those friendships where you just go along with the mean girl, even if you don't agree because you dont want to lose your friends. \n\nLow contact is good, but I wouldn't go too low, and instead work on the relationship. Talk, maybe have family therapy, or do things together that show she didn't mean to hurt people. \n\nI would also see if your wife is up to having small get togethers with your mom. Like lunch, or picking out some new dishes or something. This will help gage whether your mom is really sorry or just trying to sweep it under the rug. \n\nYou could definitely wait till after the 1st semester to say anything about the baby to see how she handles working on the relationship. \n\nSomeone people go low contact and ignore attempts when people reach out. I wouldn't ignore your mom, as her reaching out shows that she's sorry and wants to be better, to have a relationship and at least she is sorry and is trying to be better.", "So glad you talked and worked it out. And congrats!!!", "Happy wife, happy life \ud83d\ude0e", "This update is amazing!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope it's triples - just kidding.", "I think this is one if my most favorite updates.", "The number of couples I know who were unknowingly pregnant at their wedding or a friend\u2019s wedding and were incredibly drunk during the celebrations is remarkably high. \ud83e\udd23 \n\nAll those babies turned out perfectly, no issues and are gigantic and smart little kids haha.", "Much more pressing issue is folic acid: OP your wife needs to start prenatal vitamins today! Congratulations!", "Kicking the aunt out of their life seems like a win not a loss I have to say.", "What xopranaut said!", "My worry is that punishing the mom is also punishing OP's wife. Wife wants a good familial relationship and even though it's GOOD that she didn't sacrifice a part of herself for it as she was initially willing to do, I would imagine she still wants it. I don't know exactly how it went down but it sounds a little like OP talked her into the LC. Given that mom is fully repentant, I hope that the LC doesn't last too long and they can end up with a mutually fulfilling relationship, minus AH Aunt.", "Trust is not magically restored by a single apology. \n\nMom demonstrated that certain family members still have quite a lot of influence over her behavior, and it will take time for her to prove that she\u2019s not going to lash out again in order to curry favor with her sister. And the stakes are even higher now that OP and his wife are expecting a child. They are correct to be cautious.", "Apparently my fianc\u00e9e was already a few weeks pregnant when we went to carnival and got absolutely blasted. We didn't find out until we got back home, lol. The OBGYN told us not to worry that it's super common that most people don't even realize they're pregnant until like the 6th week.", "Where I come from, we call this \"Addition via Subtraction\"...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...and it's actually a wonderful feeling.", "A lot of couples stop their birth control methods before the wedding, too, if they\u2019re trying to get pregnant. So depending on where the drinking falls in a cycle quite a few women are pregnant during their wedding. But nothing counts until 6 weeks for blood sharing so it\u2019s fine haha. \n\nIt\u2019s actually how a lot of women figure out they\u2019re pregnant, too. \u201cWhy won\u2019t this hangover go away?!\u201d well, because it\u2019s not a hangover. \ud83e\udd23", "I understand you didn't suggest that.\n\nOften, people think because they apologize that it means all will be well right away.  OPs wife can have the relationship she wants with them, and from how it looks, she will give her a chance.  She's not ready yet, and that's OK too!", "Add me to your list. Had the hangover from hell New Year\u2019s Day \u201809. That \u201changover\u201d is 13 \ud83d\ude06", "No she isn't she is Spanish as in from the European country of Spain she is not from Latin America. This seems like a case of plain old wasp bigotry that honestly very common in places like the UK against other bits of Europe especially southern Europe.", "\"Half Spanish\".  If we are nitpicking is calling her a Latina racist too?\n\nLook, I'm not defending the aunt or the mom.  What they said were out of line, especially the aunt.  But it is irrelevant of race.\n\nEverything these days is elevated to race.  Not everything is about race.  Some people are just assholes regardless of race.", "[removed]", "Newsflash: Latin is a European language that once was the main language of, among others, Spain and Portugal. \u201cLatin America\u201d is only called so because the Spanish and Portuguese languages spoken there are descended from Latin.

Please report-spam-harmful bots. Thanks!", "Yeah, I wasn't holding it against you or anything."]}
