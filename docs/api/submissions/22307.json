I have taken time to heal from this and have ultimately forgiven him, and I am ready to begin a relationship with him once more. I don\u2019t want him to miss my wedding, if he so chooses. Despite this, I have not forgotten the decade of hurt his leaving caused to not just me, but my mother and sibling as well. \n\nMy family has a lot to say about this. Mainly, the question of if he will \u2018give me away\u2019 and walk me down the aisle at my wedding. \nMy instinct is hell no. He abandoned us at one of me and my brother\u2019s most difficult times. He fully cut contact and made it clear he was no longer going to be a father to us. \nMy mother has since found a wonderful new husband who has taken me under his wing. He never had daughters so he was driven to be a good father figure. I respect him for it. Though he will never be a true dad to me, he is a very important part of my life and I love him dearly. That being said, I have chosen my stepfather to walk me down the aisle. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing- when I tell family this they initially look AGHAST.

You picked the person who supports you. Your father lost the privilege the day he walked out.

They will think others will judge them for your real dad sitting on the side lines and they don\u2019t want to be embarrassed. It\u2019s about their image and to them, that\u2019s more important than your choice - which is sad. \n\nYour step dad was a dad to you. You\u2019re closer to hi than your real dad. It\u2019s shame you r mother and the rest of them can\u2019t see what a wonderful testament your decision is and how it actually reflect ms well in the family. \n\nSheesh. Weddings. \n\nStick to your guns. Refuse to discuss. Distance yourself from the drama. \n\nNTA", "How could your own father be so cold hearted? That\u2019s the question they should be asking. You can choose whoever you want- it\u2019s your wedding. It\u2019s not an opportunity for others to create the idea that you have the perfect family. I\u2019m so glad you have a good father figure in your life- celebrate that. NTA", "NTA- he doesn't get the perks when he didn't put in any work \n\nBut have you considered your mum walking you down the aisle? It feels like she deserves that role more than anyone", "NTA--My dad had very little interest in me growing up.  My mom wasn't much better. She was invited to the wedding but dad wasn't.  I walked myself down the aisle.  I think you should do whatever you want.\n\nI see a post that says you clearly haven't forgiven your dad.  Not sure why that's being said.  I have forgiven parents in that I don't actively walk around with anger anymore.  That doesn't mean I have to embrace them and pretend like things never happened.  I've just let it go for my own inner peace.\n\nDon't let anyone guilt you for choosing what you want to do on YOUR day.", "NTA.  Blood doesn\u2019t make fathers (or mothers). Hearts do.

I\u2019m sorry if your family doesn\u2019t understand but you definitely made the right decision.", "NTA Your dad already \u201cgave you away\u201d when he chose to leave.", "NTA.

You picked the one who is your father in action. It\u2019s just appropriate.", "NTA. I know you said that you don't really see him as 'dad' but it sounds like your stepfather has done everything a parent is supposed to do for a child since marrying your mom.\n\nTo quote a number of t-shirts / father's day cards: he isn't just a stepdad - he's the dad who stepped up.", "NAH. You can choose whoever you want to have \"give you away\" at your wedding, or, indeed, not have anyone do so at all. It sounds like the rest of yr family are traditionalists, despite yr father's actions.

One that you will remember forever and you deserve to have it perfect in every way.", "NTA. He lost that privilege when he walked out and now you have a wonderful man that earned it. Even one of your brothers would be a better pick then your bio dad. NTA. Congrats btw!", "Eventually, we will advance enough to drop this whole \"Give away the bride\" concept entirely. It's one thing to show your support for your child by walking with them down the aisle. It's another thing entirely to symbolically hand over ownership. \n\nAnyway, NTA. It's your wedding. You get to decide who is involved and in what capacity.", "NTA. He made it clear he was no longer going to be a father. You are adhering to his wishes..  it is your wedding, go what feels right to you. And the family telling you otherwise can go kick rocks.", "NTA,  he relinquished his role as a father figure, and your step dad stepped up.  You don't give any ages, but assuming you're getting married \\~23-25 that means you were a young teen when your bio dad abandoned you. I don't think it's right to assume when you've walked out on your family that you get to waltz in and get all rights and privileges back.  \n\nWho cares what the family thinks, they might have been affected, but that's not the same as missing a dad.  Walk with your step dad, or walk yourself down, but I think Dad gave up his rights when he walked out.", "People tend to believe the victim in a situation must forgive the bad guy, and not give them any consequences for their bad behavior because they are family. Also, there's some respect your elders crap thrown in. So, to see you hold your father accountable is making their tiny minds implode. \n\nNTA", "NTA ... he didn't earn the right to do that. As a dad myself, just because a guy is a sperm donor and helped create a child... if the bastard isn't in the childs life then he deserves as much as a stranger deserves.\n\nJUST BECAUSE HE DONATED SPERM, DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO HIM!!!!", "NTA. He gave you away when he abandoned you years ago.", "NTA\n\nForgiving someone doesn't equal forgetting. He should be grateful and respect your boundaries and decisions. You know who you want to walk you down the aisle and you know why you want that. That's the only thing that matters in this situation.\n\nDon't let anyone make you feel guilty about the choices you make regarding your special day (or life in general). I wish you and your soon-to-be husband lifetime of happiness.", "NTA....but as a father to 3 daughters, I think the tradition of \"giving\" your daughter away is outdated and a little creepy. 2 of them are married, and we didn't do the traditional walk. I would have if they wanted to, but I am glad they didn't go that route.  My wife's father gave her away, and I always thought she wasn't your property to give you away.", "NTA you get to choose who walks you down the aisle, if anyone, and you chose the person who was there for you. I think it's wonderful that your stepfather means so much to you, even if you don't see him as your dad. I hope you have a lovely wedding and your family doesn't give you too much shit for your decision, and remember: it's *your* day!", "Thank you! I thought it was so strange too. My mom, who still struggles with some aspects of the split, even seemed disappointed in me. Happy that I chose my stepdad, but suggested I be open in case my dad shows up \u2018last minute\u2019. \n\nYou\u2019re right, it must be about the optics because I do not want anyone showing up to my wedding last minute. \nLike, please rsvp and maybe have a coffee or two with me before the wedding. Do not show up unannounced last moment to make some grand gesture of an entrance. This is not a movie. It\u2019s a real life adult wedding and about a real life adult relationship. \nAppreciate your response!\n\nEdit: formatting", "And there\u2019s nothing wrong with not forgiving him! You don\u2019t ever have to if you don\u2019t want to. Has he apologized? Explained himself? Made amends? If not, it doesn\u2019t sound like he deserves forgiveness. \n\nIt always amazes me when people think their actions (in this case your dad\u2019s) will have no cons on them. \n\nHave an amazing wedding!!", "I'm saying OP haven't forgiven her dad because she clearly resents him for walking out on their family when she was younger and is trying to waltz back in. OP isn't wrong for not wanting him to walk down the aisle with her, it's HER day but if OP truly forgave him then the resentment towards him wouldn't have been even been a thought when asked the question on if he would walk her down.", "Happy cake day.   I agree, 10 years ago.", "Thank you for your reply! :)\n\n\nHe left when I was 16. Meaning he skipped town and no one knew where he went for years. Debt collectors will still bother my mom trying to find him. He\u2019s since shown back up in my home town and has not reached out. I have left him my contact info through family I know who have seen him, and through an old job of his. I\u2019ve not yet been able to figure out how to directly contact him. I just sort of threw some invitations to the wind hoping they\u2019d make it to him haha", "Maybe I am fooling myself, idk. But I\u2019m to the point where I\u2019m happy to have him at my wedding and give him a big hug for taking the huge step of attending. I want him to be apart of this once in a lifetime thing, and to eventually be apart of his grandkids lives. \n\n\nI suppose I\u2019m not sure what true forgiveness entails. I won\u2019t ignore factual history. But I will try to move past it, you know?", "Thanks :)", "This is insane. I thought your father was back in your life, and you were slowly rebuilding a relationship. Which wouldn't entitle him to walk you down the aisle, but at least it would have made some sense to consider his as a possible choice. But are you saying that you aren't even in contact with your father, he hasn't even  confirm he will come at your wedding, and people expect you to keep a spot open, and if this guy you haven't seen in years decides to show up, he gets to be part of the wedding?", "Wait, he hasn't even talked to you again since abandoning you and people are expecting him to walk you down the aisle? WTF, hell no."]}
