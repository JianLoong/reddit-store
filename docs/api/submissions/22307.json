Same story; dad walked out and became more and more distant as my brother and I grew up. Terrible relationship honestly until we reset things when I turned 18. It\u2019s not a very deep relationship now but I maintain civility and respect as long he doesn\u2019t get out of line. \n\nI\u2019ve moved on and mostly forgiven him but he was never going to walk me down the aisle. You know who did? The man who\u2019d been by my side through growing up. The guy who\u2019d always had my back. The dude who will still tell me (40sF) \u201cI love you dude\u201d now and when we\u2019re in our 80\u2019s. My brother. \n\nI had so much fun at my wedding having my brother walk me down the aisle. There was a ren fair theme to the wedding and he was dressed the part, compete with a sword! He shook my husband\u2019s hand and they hugged briefly. \n\nHOLD YOUR GROUND. You owe your bio dad nothing. This is you and your husband\u2019s day. You two make the calls on what you want to happen and the memories you two want to make. \n\nAnd your family? \u201cI love you all and hope that you will respect my decision to have stepdad walk me down the aisle as he has been a wonderful father to me all the years I\u2019ve known him.\u201d Anyone who continues to object quite frankly can sit in the back and keep their sourpuss out of your fabulous wedding day pictures!\n\nBest of luck my dear. Have a wonderful wedding.", "Your life, your wedding, your choice.  You are not an AH.  Your father made a deliberate choice to neglect his family, his daughter.  There are consequences to bad behavior.  I regretted allowing my father to walk me down the aisle for multiple reasons.  Show your appreciation of the man who played the role of father to you, or be independent nd walk yourself down the aisle .  Both would be more honest choices than having your father walk you down the aisle. kt", "NTA\n\nBut why does it have to be a male who gives you away?

You're saying mom feels responsible for OP not having a relationship with their dad. Am I reading that wrong?\n\nIt also comes off as you agreeing that mom is in fact responsible, which is why I commented that it is 100% on dad that dad abandoned his kid. You may not have intended it that way, and if you didn't, great.", "NTA. You're a way better person than I am. My dad isn't even going to be invited to my wedding, I don't care that I'm his ONLY child.

You owe him nothing. \n\nA wedding should include the people that are most supportive of you.  Consider not inviting the toxic family members that think you are doing the wrong thing...  You don't owe them an invitation either.\n\nOne of my friends had an estranged father.  They did have some sort of contact but essentially her and her sibling were discarded by him and his family when her parents divorced.  Her mother barely had 2 cents to buy groceries after the bills were paid and worked damn hard for it... while they were rolling in cash but never ever helped the kids out.\n\nWhen she got married, she was very clear her father was not walking her down the aisle.  Her mother never remarried so she had her brother and mother walk her down the aisle.  Her dad did come and sit at the back of the church preening his chest and looking like a proud peacock... but he slithered off like the snake he was after the ceremony.  No one batted an eyelid about who walked her down the aisle and if there were people there that thought she did the wrong thing... well they weren't game enough to verbalise it!", "NTA. He shouldn't expect this after walking away from you for years.", "NTA...and stop worrying about what ANYONE else thinks about your decision to have your stepfather walk you down the isle. Your dad could have been great, and it would still be your decision because it your wedding, but you had my vote when you said your dad cut contact with his children voluntarily...that's all she wrote. He, and everyone else, should understand that you never come all the way back from that; he's lucky you're even cool with him at all. Anyone who doesn't get it just doesn't get it.

You follow step-dad's path, not your sperm donor's.\n\nStep-dad met the challenge of parenting, sperm donor didn't, he ran from it.\n\nWhich example does your husband-to-be respect?  What you choose is quite possibly going to reflect in your married life.", "Well dad gave up that role and step-dad had to take over for him.

A father has no right to give his daughter away it is an archaic ritual that no longer applies because wives and daughters are no longer viewed as property.\n\nIMO, anyone escorting the bride down the aisle should be chosen for the job because their opinions matter most to the bride. My sister (beasties since we were 6, Sister by choice) wasn't escorted by her dad or step dad, but instead, she waited at the top of the stairs, and her groom raced up and collected her.
