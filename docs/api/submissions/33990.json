We have one daughter, Madelyn (8f). I have a SIL, Jasmin (32f) and she has been having infertility issues for a while now and has had a couple of miscarriages. Jasmin and I aren't that close but we're friendly to each other. \r  \n\r  \nShe got pregnant a few months ago and she had her gender reveal party about 2 weeks ago. Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.\r  \n\r  \nDuring this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.\r  \n\r  \nI asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!\r  \n\r  \nI was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first. \r  \n\r  \nWe went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings. I texted him back and told him that she should stop being such a witch and try to understand my feelings instead.

If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.\r  \n\r  \nI asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!\r  \n\r  \nI was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first. \r  \n\r  \nWe went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her.

No.  If you want to maintain family unity, call her up, explain that you felt a bit blindsided and overwhelmed in that moment, that you've thought it over, and it's not worth having a falling out over.

As someone who has a very common name (especially for a girl born in the mid 80s) - Sarah Louise - it's really not that big of a deal and in some instances can help break the ice and form friendships initially through a shared name. Kids don't give a F whether someone has the same name as them and I can pretty much guarantee that if you hadn't made such a fuss about it your daughter wouldn't have batted an eye at her cousin being given the same name - if anything it would probably have been a source of pride and connection between them. You could have handled the situation a lot differently and made it so that your daughter saw it as something nice, that their name is so lovely that her aunt wants to name her daughter the same thing, but that it would be spelled differently.\n\nYour SIL could have also handled the situation better. Rather than just blurting it out over Christmas dinner she could have spoken with you/your partner/your daughter (maybe not as she is so young) about the thing privately so you wouldn't be blindsided by it. She doesn't have to ask your permission but explaining it privately, that the name means a lot to her personally, having been her great aunt's name and something she had planned to name her daughter before she miscarried. Your suggestion that she could have told you before you named your daughter is ludicrous! For one thing - your daughter is 8yrs old! Even if she knew she was going to try for a baby that long ago, there was no guarantee it would be a girl. If she then suffered fertility issues, including miscarriages, do you really expect her to come to you after you announce your intention to name your daughter, (did you check with everyone before naming her that they didn't plan to use it first?) and say \"IF my baby lives and IF she is a girl then that's the name I am going to use too!\"?? Never mind how ridiculous and controlling that would be to essentially tell someone they can't name their kid something because if you carry a baby to term and the baby happens to be a girl you will use that name - do you not think that having the commitment of publicly (even if it is just family) putting a name to a child you're afraid you may lose would be incredibly painful and put even more pressure on a pregnancy when there have been fertility issues in the past?\n\nNo-one was in the right here but in my opinion you're making a situation worse than it should ever be. If it really gets too confusing for you (not an experience I or the many other Sarah's I have known have experienced enough to be annoying or intrusive btw) then the name has several cute nickname versions (Maddy, Lynn, Ada, Mads, Maggie, Lynnie etc) which you can use for your daughter or one for each.", "YTA\n\nIt causes you no harm for her to name her child the same\nShe has a connection to the name \nIt is not uncommon to have cousins with the same names\n\u201cMy daughter was confused\u201d because of your ott reaction.

She can name her kid Madilyn if she wants. Just give their kid a nickname and call them by their nickname if you want. Heck, call that child by their middle name and make it a thing.\n\nWhen they're born, just have a chat with your daughter and tell her not to respond to anyone who calls her by the middle name.

I would never ever ever shut up about it. I would fully expect a last minute change of heart about this naming nonsense when SIL realizes you Uno reverso'ed  this sad power play.

(It would be quirky and hilarious rather than upsetting tbh) Chances are slim that a Madelyn is getting to adulthood without acquiring a nickname or two anyway. Your daughter is 8 and old enough to insist she wants to be \u201cjust Madelyn\u201d (if she cares). So probably the other one becomes \u201cbaby Madelyn\u201d or \u201cMaddie\u201d or something. It will happen naturally but if your daughter has opinions she probably would be able to choose a nickname and make it stick (as long as it isn\u2019t mean spirited).

Madelyn is old enough to have a say in what she's called, and that should be taken into account.\n\nYour SIL can still call her daughter Madilyn. However, she will need to accept that Madelyn the First will not be changing her name unless she is really wanting to. And that any nicknames or use of middle names will most likely be going to her daughter for the first few years of her life, not the other way around. If she's not comfortable with that, then the only other options are to either pick a different name or accept that there will be confusions for some time until a distinction can be made during conversations.\n\nFor now, OP, just take a step back.
