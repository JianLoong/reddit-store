We have one daughter, Madelyn (8f). I have a SIL, Jasmin (32f) and she has been having infertility issues for a while now and has had a couple of miscarriages. Jasmin and I aren't that close but we're friendly to each other. \r  \n\r  \nShe got pregnant a few months ago and she had her gender reveal party about 2 weeks ago. Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.\r  \n\r  \nDuring this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.\r  \n\r  \nI asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!\r  \n\r  \nI was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first. \r  \n\r  \nWe went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings. I texted him back and told him that she should stop being such a witch and try to understand my feelings instead.

If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.\r  \n\r  \nI asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!\r  \n\r  \nI was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first. \r  \n\r  \nWe went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn.

As someone who has a very common name (especially for a girl born in the mid 80s) - Sarah Louise - it's really not that big of a deal and in some instances can help break the ice and form friendships initially through a shared name. Kids don't give a F whether someone has the same name as them and I can pretty much guarantee that if you hadn't made such a fuss about it your daughter wouldn't have batted an eye at her cousin being given the same name - if anything it would probably have been a source of pride and connection between them. You could have handled the situation a lot differently and made it so that your daughter saw it as something nice, that their name is so lovely that her aunt wants to name her daughter the same thing, but that it would be spelled differently.\n\nYour SIL could have also handled the situation better. Rather than just blurting it out over Christmas dinner she could have spoken with you/your partner/your daughter (maybe not as she is so young) about the thing privately so you wouldn't be blindsided by it. She doesn't have to ask your permission but explaining it privately, that the name means a lot to her personally, having been her great aunt's name and something she had planned to name her daughter before she miscarried. Your suggestion that she could have told you before you named your daughter is ludicrous! For one thing - your daughter is 8yrs old! Even if she knew she was going to try for a baby that long ago, there was no guarantee it would be a girl. If she then suffered fertility issues, including miscarriages, do you really expect her to come to you after you announce your intention to name your daughter, (did you check with everyone before naming her that they didn't plan to use it first?) and say \"IF my baby lives and IF she is a girl then that's the name I am going to use too!\"?? Never mind how ridiculous and controlling that would be to essentially tell someone they can't name their kid something because if you carry a baby to term and the baby happens to be a girl you will use that name - do you not think that having the commitment of publicly (even if it is just family) putting a name to a child you're afraid you may lose would be incredibly painful and put even more pressure on a pregnancy when there have been fertility issues in the past?\n\nNo-one was in the right here but in my opinion you're making a situation worse than it should ever be. If it really gets too confusing for you (not an experience I or the many other Sarah's I have known have experienced enough to be annoying or intrusive btw) then the name has several cute nickname versions (Maddy, Lynn, Ada, Mads, Maggie, Lynnie etc) which you can use for your daughter or one for each.", "YTA\n\nIt causes you no harm for her to name her child the same\nShe has a connection to the name \nIt is not uncommon to have cousins with the same names\n\u201cMy daughter was confused\u201d because of your ott reaction.

Heck, call that child by their middle name and make it a thing.\n\nWhen they're born, just have a chat with your daughter and tell her not to respond to anyone who calls her by the middle name.

So all those Joe Bloggs Jr's is see are doing it wrong?", "Not even cousins but some family friends had a girl who shared a name and it was damn near impossible to call one without summoning the other. Many visits went through some version of,\u201d yes? Wrong one.\u201d Rinse and repeat four or five times. Each visit.", "You don\u2019t come from an Italian family do you? I have, 5 Anthony\u2019s, 3 Lorenzo\u2019s and 2 John Micheal\u2019s and they are first cousins.", "I share my first name with my first cousin and don\u2019t care at all. Ours were both named after distant relatives in different families. Families called us big and little when we were young and then changed to nicknames as we got older. Maybe it came up once or twice when we were kids but honestly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth losing family over it. OP\u2019s sister in law gave reasons beyond just I want to piss you off as to why she was choosing the name. The only point where I feel SIL is being an asshole about it is when she tells OP to just start changing what they\u2019re calling their daughter.", "I wouldn't do it but I know at least three people off the top of my head who have the same name as their first cousin - one has the same first and middle name, even!  When they're older, no one cares.  It's Mike and Michael or Becca and Rebecca or Chrissy and Christina.  It sorts itself out just fine.", "I literally just left a holiday dinner with family where there was someone else with the same name as my daughter. It didn\u2019t matter. We all knew who was who.", "It's not that rare.  It's not extremely common today but as you can see from a ton of comments it's common enough for it to not be a big deal.", "Nonsense.  I have a first cousin a year younger than me who has the same name I do.  Never caused a problem for either of us.  OP is being completely childish.", "It seems you haven\u2019t spoken to many Catholics from large families about their cousins\u2019 names. First cousins sharing the same name is quite common across several cultures.", "George Foreman managed just fine naming all of his boys George.", "Pretty sure the only reason the 8 year old was \u201cconfused\u201d is because she saw the whole argument & now she\u2019s backing up her mom. \n\nMost young kids would have been flattered. Like, hell yeah, my name is a awesome!", "Sounds like allegations of witchcraft are flying back and forth.", "right? WTAF?", "Most of them aren\u2019t cousins", "Seriously.  This whole \u201cI called dibs on this name\u201d is childish at best.  Guess what?  There\u2019s going to be a whole lot of Madeline, Madelyn, Madelin, Mattylyns out there in the world.  Deal with it.", "I have 2 first cousins name Laura and 3 named David. It's totally fine.", "It\u2019s the same in my family. I have 2 first cousins & one 2nd cousin, all share the same first name, & all 3 are about the same age. Nobody has ever confused one for the other, there\u2019s never been any kind of mixup because of the names. They all have different middle names, but only one has a different last name. But in my case, my dad had 7 siblings & each of them had at least 4 kids, and the 3 cousins lived in different areas. So, I personally don\u2019t see this like a big deal. \n\nHowever, SIL\u2019s behavior was mean and hateful. I find it hard to believe that she picked this name for her 1st pregnancy, lost the child, OP\u2019s daughter is born & named, & in all of that time SIL never once told anyone that\u2019s the name she would use for a daughter. And then, to even suggest that OP\u2019s 8 yo will have to start being called by her middle name\u2026.no fukin way!\n\nBottom line is, OP\u2019s daughter is the first Madelyn born into the family. No matter what story SIL tries to spin, everyone is going to see that OP\u2019s daughter was named 8+ years before SIL\u2019s daughter.", "If the name was the only issue, I'd agree and call it NAH or ESH. But SIL was incredibly out of line for saying OP would be so horrible as to deliberately name her daughter after her miscarriage. OP literally told her that if she knew the name had dibs she would have reconsidered it, and SIL verbally spat in her face in return. NTA for specifically that.", "What?? The world didn\u2019t end? You weren\u2019t horribly traumatized and didn\u2019t need years of therapy? How odd. /s", "Oh thank goodness!! Some sanity!!  In my family several cousins, uncles, and aunts have the same name.  No one cares!   There are 3 of each for some names.", "This", "So many people just have a burning desire to be different in any way possible. Hence..where we are right now in the world. Thanks for a solid comment.", "Yep, having a very large Italian-American family, you can swing a rope and hit several people named Frank, Joseph, Vito, Christopher, John, Anthony, Maria/Mary, and Vincent/Vincenzo/a.\n\nJust to put it out there, my grandfather was Joseph Anthony, my brother is Joseph Anthony, and my cousin is Anthony Joseph, and two of my grandfather cousins (who lived next door) were Josephina Antonia and Antonia Maria.\n\nNobody cared. My aunt was a bit miffed, I was not named after her. (Thank god)", "My nephew called Jim is named after his father, James. Later, his father had another son who was named James after him too and called Jamie. Nothing bad happened and the two half brothers are friendly but not close since they live pretty far apart. \n\nNo one cares. Really.", "Right my family is full of Robert Bs and Marie as a middle names no one feels they have the rights to a name.", "Really the other woman never said she wanted this name when OP would have named her daughter something different if she\u2019d known and immediately called her a witch. She also wants OP\u2019s daughter to start going by her middle name. Sounds like SIL needs therapy.", "My aunt and the wife of a cousin once removed (aunt and he were first cousins) were pregnant at the same time.  I know my aunt had hurt feelings because she wanted the biblical spelling of Rebecca but the other Rebekah was born first.  Everyone survived, including my aunt and including my cousins.", "BM omg lolol this comment is pure gold", "Love your level of polite pettiness. SIL will think twice before really naming her baby Madilyn.", "Oooh, I like your level of petty.", "This!! Love it", "Great idea!!!", "She shouldn\u2019t even ask. Just start calling the baby Junior to everyone in the family. Start now, before she\u2019s born, then it will stick.", "We ran into it with grown women.  \n\nJohn Brown has a sister, Mary Ann Brown.  He marries Mary Ann Black.  There are now two Mary Ann Browns in the family. \n\nIn our case, one was a doctor, and one was married, so we had Dr. Mary and Mrs. Mary.", "It's John for us. There are a lot of them. Even first cousins both named the same just like in this situation. It's caused zero issues. I've never understood why people care so much. When they get to school and there are 3 Madelyns (obviously with 3 different unique spellings)  are they going to insist the others change their name?", "First Madelyn and Second Madilyn. Or Madelyn the First and Madilyn the Second. Lol!", "'madelyn' and 'the other madelyn, because my mother is a witch'", "While calling OP\u2019s niece \u201cOther Madelyn\u201d or would do nicely, I think \u201cEcho\u201d is a cuter nickname \ud83e\udd23", "I love your answer in so many ways. <3", "It won\u2019t always be there. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your name. There are other kids names Madelyn. Your cousin is named after their great aunt.\u201d \n\nThe OPs kid is 8. There won\u2019t be any confusion between an 8 year old and a newborn. Their age gap works here. No one will think the Op is talking about a newborn when they mention their kid playing softball or whatever.", "Oh, that\u2019s lush!", "Not a sibling.  Husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife.\n\ni think it\u2019s hilarious.  I\u2019d call the younger one Lyn or number 2.  Older one has 9 years of name claiming.  No one is going to change what they call her.", "Lmao, get outta my head \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Well, not her literal sibling at all. It's her SIL who she stated she's not close with. It's so wild to me the huge divide in this thread of people who personally know or are related to a ton of people who share (especially SUPER common) names with cousins, and then the people like you who think it would be the weirdest thing ever.\n\nAnd the SIL only proposed that as a solution to OP not liking it, not as a demand. SIL is fine with two girls who are 8 years apart and may or may not ever really spend much time together sharing one of the most common names of the last 15 years, which won't even be spelled the same.", "Do I have names picked out that I would name my kids? yes. Have I ever just proactively announced those names to my sister (or any family member?) Hell no. I would not announce that until I was actually like close to giving birth", "Sounds like OP has been behaving in a certain way, causing SIL not wanting to share any information with her. She's not obligated to do so anyway. \n\nStorming out of a Christmas dinner and causing drama in the family over a name is extremely immature and entitled behaviour. OP should listen to SIL, she doesn't call her a witch for no reason.", "OP made a fuss about confusion AFTER SIL called her a witch.", "How do you figure? Honest question.", "This happens in my family even with names that are just similar sounding. Not even the same name or gender\u2014having the exact same name (on purpose) would be so annoying if I were the one sharing the name.", "The horror. Thank god everyone survived.", "They got last names, don\u2019t they? School teachers solved this problem generations ago,  why are we pretending it\u2019s such a hurdle?\n\n\u201cKatie B, time to go!\u201d", "It\u2019s just strange to do it on purpose (unless it\u2019s a name that\u2019s inherited). I don\u2019t think most people sharing a name would be happy about it (so I personally would not do that to my kid either).", "My uncle was Big Tommy and my older cousin was Little Tommy. Youre totally right. It does work out.", "Came here to say something similar. We had cousins named John Charles and John William. During family gatherings they were each known by their first and middle names.\n\nEdit:fat fingered 'Charles\".", "Yes, but I have no idea why anyone would want to purposefully do that.", "I have a cousin who has a cousin on her dad\u2019s side who has the exact same name down to the spelling. Like if my cousin was Kathryn Ann Smith, she has a cousin who is Kathryn Ann Smith. And they are only a few months apart in age. (Their dads are brothers hence the same last name.) They went to school together for years. My cousin is a good kid. Her cousin? Not so much. She came pretty close to getting in major trouble a few times because of the cousin. \n\nThen on my dad\u2019s side we have a bunch of guys with the same name. My grandpa, dad, brother, cousin, different cousin\u2019s husband and that same cousin\u2019s son all have the same name. My dad and cousin were named after grandpa and my brother was named after dad. They all went by various nicknames or their initials so we could tell them all apart.", "What\u2019s the difference with common names though like  Elizabeth or Mary. Loads of cousins share those names. Mothers and daughters. Or fathers and sons. Madilyn is super common. I went to school with like 3 of them in my class.", "Agreed on the adults part, somewhat ironic and at least as adults it can be found humorous. The kids don't have a choice though.", "Maddy and Madi for shorts?", "Madelyn and second Madilyn. The original should not have to adjust.", "I love this idea.  Just start referring to her that way now before they name the other baby", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just over a name but being protective of her daughter. It\u2019s already prompted a request to change the name she goes by so doesn\u2019t feel entirely unwarranted either.", "Yeah but man when you\u2019re 13-14 and getting your sass in, it feels like the worst thing ever.", "I\u2019m a teacher and have had multiple repeated names in a class (one year I had 3 boys with the same name, two with the same first name same last initial). It\u2019s not an issue. Most have a nickname or preferred name anyway.", "I have 2 cousin \u201cJacob\u201ds.  They are both named after our grandfather.   They have different last names.  One cousin is \u201cJacob Smith\u201d and the other cousin is \u201cJacob Jones III.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a big deal.", "Because they like the name it ain't that deep.", "Because they have a family member they love and want to commemorate and they like the name? It\u2019s hard to pick a name you like. I also get the miscarriage position, having had one myself. They wanted to use this name for a long time, and I can see how they wouldn\u2019t want to give that up because her body took longer to be able to carry a pregnancy. \n\nIt\u2019s a minor inconvenience, and I wouldn\u2019t pick a different name for that reason. Also, kids decide their nicknames. So even if both parents want the kid to go by Madelyn, chances are that will change naturally as the kids get older.", "I just think that classmates or coworkers are ONE thing. But family members? It was SUPER awkward for me to have someone with the same name as me in my class. I can\u2019t even imagine it being my cousin who I may or may not see more often.", "I don\u2019t disagree with wanting to honour/the miscarriage, but I do think OP has a right to be taken aback by it (and that SIL could\u2019ve mentioned the desire to use that name in future for that particular reason, OP seems to have been open to using a completely different name had she known)."]}
