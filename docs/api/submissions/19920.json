{"id": 19920, "submission_id": "14bytiw", "title": "AITA for being nice to my step-niece?", "selftext": "I (28F) have a stepsister, Connie (30F). Last year, Connie married Jeff (34M), who has a 6 year old daughter, Ruby. I've met Ruby three times before very briefly, because I live in a different country than the rest of the family, and Connie and I aren't close so the only time I see her is at our parents' house. I know Connie has had a tough time bonding with Ruby because my stepdad mentioned it, but I didn't think anything of It because it's tough at that age, coming from a blended family I know it's tough at any age and just takes time, normally.\n\n\nLast weekend, I was visiting my parents for a week and Connie, Jeff, and Ruby were visiting for the weekend since our parents have land and a pool and the weather was nice. Connie, Jeff, and my stepdad went to get food, so my mum and I were watching Ruby in the pool. Ruby came up to me and said \"my dad says you're a princess. Is that true?\". I said no, and I swear this adorable kid looked so heartbroken so I was like \"but I've met a few\" and proceeded to tell her some stories about people I've met. Turns out she's a big fan of anything princess, so I took her inside and let her try on all the old princess dresses and I had when I was a kid (I was a dress up FIEND) and some of my jewellery, and I put on my dress from Connie's wedding and we played \"princess\".\n\n\nWhen Connie and Jeff came back Ruby ran over and said she had a lot of fun playing princess and I gave her a present (I said she could keep the earrings of mine she was wearing) and she wanted Jeff to marry me. It was super awkward until Jeff just laughed and said I was marrying someone else (I'm engaged), and took Ruby to the kitchen for a snack.The second they were out of earshot Connie unloaded on me, whisper-shouting how I was sneaky and conniving and trying to turn Ruby against her. She said I was way out of line trying so hard to weasel my way in and make her like me better, especially since I knew Ruby already wasn't opening up to Connie.\n\n\nConnie didn't speak to me the whole rest of the weekend and Ruby was pretty much glued to me. I feel bad. My mum is a stepmother, so I now it can be hard when it feels like the kids hate you, and I didn't mean to make Ruby \"like me more\". Honestly, I'm not even that keen on kids, and I maybe overcompensated so I didn't seem mean. Did I overstep? Should I have kept more of a distance?", "created_utc": 1687028411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bytiw/aita_for_being_nice_to_my_stepniece/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see why Ruby doesn\u2019t like Connie that much. Because she\u2019s a jealous ahole. \nSeriously what is she thinking? If anything Connie could\u2019ve used this as an opportunity to try to bond with Ruby over princesses or try to join the fun?! \n\nI really understand why Ruby doesn\u2019t like her step mom if this is the way she behaves. It\u2019s okay for Connie to be hurt but her actions were not", "NTA. So your sister is upset that you were kind and interested in her stepdaughter? Wow. You can't win for losing. She's just insecure, so try to shake it off. You didn't do anything wrong. What were you supposed to do, be mean to the kid so your sister looks good in comparison? Give me a break.", "NTA, you were just being kind. I can understand why Connie was upset, but to immediately attribute this to malice is unfair. I would say that perhaps you could email (or text or whatever) Connie or something and explain that you didn't have that intention at all, and suggest that she might want to try to play princess with her too and lean into Ruby's interests. You certainly don't have to though, since you're not in the wrong. I'm sorry that you being nice to a child led to a sticky situation.", "NTA - you took the time to bond with a step-niece.  You both were at one point into Princesses, it is a shame that Connie wasn't willing to be a princess-for-a-day to try and bond with Ruby.  Connie needs to get a life, Ruby is a child with limited interests and Connie isn't willing to work with her.", "NTA Connie needs to work on her insecurities. All you did was be kind to a child. Maybe Ruby likes you better because Connie's not that nice to her.", "NTA. Connie needs to get a grip on life.  You had something that you could share with Ruby and your were generous enough with your time and efforts to do it.  Connie is prolly just jealous.  \n\nPeople have different interests and resources, yours include Princess clothing and energy.  This is crazy talk, everyone should just be nice to Ruby.", "NTA\n\nI can see why Ruby doesn\u2019t like Connie.", "no one should be shouted at for being kind to a kid.    \nsit your sister down and show her how you interacted with Ruby.  Maybe that will help her with her own bonding?  But also being her favorite aunty is a win for your whole family isn't it?   \nHer insecurity is on her- not you.  \nNTA", " NTA You were kind to a child who was alone with strange adults. Maybe your sister isn\u2019t being as kind a genuine as she thinks she is!", "connie sounds like the kind of women that gets jealous when the partner hangs out with their daughter too much. \n\nNTA, she needs someone in your family to bond with and if she doesn\u2019t like connie it\u2019s not Ruby\u2019s problem it\u2019s Connie\u2019s.", "NTA this is actually ridiculous to get angry at a family member for bonding with a child from outside the family that was married into it. She\u2019s projecting her own insecurities onto you and is acting childish herself. She owes you an apology.", "You and Ruby turned out organically, not your or the kid feel forced and bonded over  a common interest. Connie isn't bright is her?, Instead of seeing this as a way into Ruby's world is mad at you, lol,instead of a door she saw an obstacle, even if you didn't do anything for the kid to like you and the kid was just bored the whole time she was with you and your mom, Connie would never have bonded with the kid, I assume is because she tries to force it, if it wasn't you would have been anybody, NTA.", "NTA your sister is just being insecure.", "NTA - This is about Connie's insecurities. You did nothing wrong.  They left for food and you provided a wholesome magical play time for a 6-yr old. Yes, Ruby asked a hurtful question but she does not understand it's gravity. If Jeff and Connie ostracize every safe talented adult who can enrich Ruby's life their daughter will lose out.", "NTA - i find it Kind of strange, that your stepdad tells you Ruby Likes princesses and you hopped in the train and played princesses with her. I mean didn't your sister could have thought of the Same Thing? You knew for Like 5 min and created a Play while she didn't even try. So Basically you are NTA but Sound Like a super fun Person to be with", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wow.  Connie\u2019s got some serious issues if she thinks you had any sort of malicious motive to scheme to get Ruby to like you better.   \n\nYou were being nice, engaging, and communicating with Ruby on something she was clearly enamored with\u2026.simple as that.  If that\u2019s such a foreign concept to Connie, no wonder she\u2019s having a tough time bonding.", "NTA.  You were being kind to a child. Clearly her dad appreciated it.", "Nta. Connie is.", "NTA. Sounds like Connie is taking her frustration out on you. \nGreat job giving your new niece a happy memory, doesn't sound like you overstepped", "NTA. You were super kind to a little girl. My daughter would also love you forever. It is weird though that her dad said you were a princess? Again, not your fault and nothing to do you with. Just kind of weird.", "NTA for all the reasons everyone else stated. Connie\u2019s inadequacies are not your responsibility. You\u2019re going to be a great mom.", "NTA it was pretty easy to win Ruby over as a virtual stranger by *checks notes* playing dress up with her. I wonder how many times Connie has done that.", "Uhhh okay but if Jeff out here is telling ruby op is a princess then there might be something else brewing. Imo that's a red flag. Add in ruby asks Jeff to marry op.. red flags all the way. \nOp, still 100000000% nta \nConnie definitely shouldn't have reacted the way she did, there were a lot of better approaches to that", "NTA\n\nSounds like Connie hasn't tried meeting Ruby on her level, and has been pushing the \"I'm your mom now\" instead. Which. Obviously fails spectacularly. If anything she should be grateful she now knows what Ruby is into and how they can bond over princess stuff, and that's your doing. She sounds really insufferable and jealous.", "You can almost see how her little brain was working overtime. \n\n\u201cDaddy wants to get married. OP plays with me and is nice. Daddy should marry OP.\u201d\n\nI really want to know how Connie interacts with Ruby when there are no eyes on them.", "Why would Jeff call ya a princess tho\ud83d\ude2d", "NTA but you need to think more on why your step sisters husband is telling his daughter, who you\u2019ve barely met, that you are a princess - this is weird. Connie\u2019s reaction was way over the top aggressive but there may be a deeper issue at hand here than just jealousy", "What your sister essentially said is \u201cif you\u2019re kind to this little girl, she wont desperately need kindness from me. If she only receives attention and care from me and her father, she will be dependent on me for those things.\u201d This is the most fucked up way to think about parenthood. People should want their kids to receive kindness from other people, not cling to the possibility that their stepmom will give them attention that they cannot get anywhere else. NTA.", "NTA\n\nConnie should have used your cred to increase her own.  \"Yeah my sister's pretty cool....\"", "Exactly! Connie should have used this opportunity & even ask OP for some pointers if need be. \n\nPlus it\u2019s always easier to befriend a potential aunt than a potential stepmom. \n\nNTA", "Step sis going about this the wrong way aside, why the dad calling you a princess? seems kinda odd but overall nta for niece taking a liking to you for being nice and playing with her.", "Nta. You did nothing wrong. If your step sister wants to bond, than she needs to step up, not have everyone else step back. The moment ruby said you both played princesses, she should have sounded super excited and say i wanna play too!. Its not hard. But if she doesnt put in the effort, she will keep getting the same reception", "NTA. You were kind. R is clearly in need of kindness.", "NTA \n\nHoly hell. Connie seriously wants you to be mean to a 6 year old so she looks better!\n\nThat\u2019s serious asshole territory!\n\nI mean if I was Connie I\u2019d be saying \u201chey OP, give me some hints to win the kid over\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019d just be assuming Connie is one of those adults who is saying things like \u201cbecause I said\u201d and \u201cyou have to respect me\u201d even though I have zero respect for you or your opinion kid. Yeah. That\u2019s on Connie"]}
