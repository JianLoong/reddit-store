She sounds like an awful person all around.", "NTA ! LMAO, I love this !", "NTA.\n\nFuck your sister and your family, frankly.\n\nAccusations of abuse are incredibly serious. As we all know from the last decade of \"me too\", sometimes false accusations happen and they literally destroy peoples lives. Your sister accused your fiance of being an abuser with absolutely no evidence whatsoever, and of course, hilariously, he was in fact being the absolutely picture of the perfect partner/gentleman in taking care of you while you were recovering.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished, right? \"Oh, your fiance is an absolute dream and won't allow you to lift a finger while you recover from a serious injury? Well, I bet that's just because he's feeling guilty BECAUSE I BET HE ACTUALLY BEATS YOU AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE INJURED!\"\n\nYour fiance will probably never forgive any of them, nor should he. \n\nComparing a valid observation of obesity to a false accusation of abuse is so fucking laughable. If I were your fiance I would probably never forgive your family. In fact I'm a little impressed you guys are even still together; you must have a strong relationship.\n\nYour entire family, and especially your sister, owe your fiance a MASSIVE heartfelt apology.

OP injuries herself and boyfriend (now fiance) does everything he can to take care of her. OP's sister decides, without asking OP, that she's being abused. Sister tells this to everyone at the engagement party, causing the entire family to think fiance is an abuser. Fiance has to grab CCTV footage to prove he's not, destroying his trust with OP's family. Sister never even admits she was wrong or apologizes, and now expects sister and fiance to apologize to her??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe the comment was a little rude, but it doesn't compare to what your sister did.

Your sister accusing your fianc\u00e9 of abuse without cause was reprehensible.\n2. Your family minimizing your sister's behavior is horrible.\n3.

I'm fat, so I get how hurtful such comments can be. But what your sister did had the potential to forever alienate him from your family and thus you from your family too. Is she jealous of you having an attentive partner? It's the only explanation I have for such a horrible accusation. \n\nOf course this also has potential to hurt the relationship you two have with your family - but that's not on your fianc\u00e9 but your sister.", "NTA. Wow, I literally came from commenting on a thread where DV is strongly implied. This feels like fate, haha.\n\nAs someone who's been prosecution and defense at different times throughout my career, an abuse allegation is NOT a small thing to be easily brushed off and clarified. Even if it isn't abuse, it isn't nice to be wrongly accused of anything: theft, cheating, spreading rumors, anything. That sticks with you, especially if your accuser refuses to apologize and defends the false accusation as \"concern.\" This is why they tell people to acquit in case of doubt--can you imagine how horrible it would be to be punished when innocent? Can you imagine how horrible things would be for him if he didn't have CCTV footage? I was falsely accused of \"stealing\" someone's boyfriend in high school and was cornered in the bathroom by a mob of pissed off high school seniors girls. I was exonerated by the boyfriend coming clean with the girlfriend's best friend, but it was a hard six weeks. I got a ton of apologies, but I've never forgotten what that felt like, especially since it was a charge that was hard to disprove. \n\nFat-shaming is bad. But I'll give him--and by extension, you--a pass because he deserves to get a little of his own back. I just hope you both realize that family relations will not improve after this, lol. Help your sister work on herself. Maybe then she'll stop trying to sabotage you and your partner.", "Won\u2019t apologize even with video evidence?

Her.", "NTA. Nothing worse than a woman making false accusations. She is automatically believed and the damage can be long-lasting. Fortunately, OP had CCTV. But she shouldn\u2019t have had to. Poor fianc\u00e9. I would not be surprised if he wanted to go low contact with her side of the family. Sure, it was a low blow but honestly, he was entirely justified. Sister\u2019s false abuse allegations could have ruined his life and his relationship.\n\nSister is a monster. Cut her out of your life, OP. If she was willing to do it once, she will most definitely do it again. Hell, she isn\u2019t even remorseful. \n\nAnyone that says you\u2019re wrong or everyone is at fault here needs their head checked.

Your bf blew that dream & you supported him. Now there\u2019s an entire generation of AHs.\n\nYour BF needs to get over the abuse accusation.

Hell, the #1 cause of death of pregnant women is murder by their partners. \n\nThe reason I say to have a conversation with him on this is it may help give him perspective on it and to understand some of the biases and pre-programming women have when it comes to men. I'm not saying any of it is right or wrong, but I am saying that it exists. For him to understand that their ability to believe it does NOT come from their view of him as a person so much as it does from patriarchal conditioning might help him find some personal closure in it and maybe lessening any questioning and doubt he may have internalized about himself.", "I really wish we had a Justified Asshole option.. as it is, NTA.", "NTA and your sister sounds like she loves to gossip and put down other people.
