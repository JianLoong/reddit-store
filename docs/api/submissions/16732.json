{"id": 16732, "submission_id": "13c4eg5", "title": "AITA for telling my best friends husband she\u2019s cheating?", "selftext": "So I (35f) have went through a kind of amicable divorce with my ex husband (35M) of 15 years, for about 6 months. In that time I confided mostly in my mom, my best friend (37F) and my new boyfriend.\n\nOver this time I\u2019ve been cultivating my new relationship, which I\u2019m really happy in, but people like to tell me what my ex is up to. Sometimes these things bothered me, but I was mostly happy for him when I saw he was out living his life. Anytime I\u2019d hear something I\u2019d tell my best friend and she\u2019d respond with a snippy \u201cwhy are people even telling you what he\u2019s doing?\u201d \u201cWhy do you care, aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d \u201cYou need to grow up and work on your current relationship.\u201d\n\nI just took it as her trying to help me be the better person. Well over the weekend I noticed my ex and her mom were Facebook friends, which is weird because her mom doesn\u2019t add people on Facebook. I\u2019ve been her friend for 10 years and her moms not my friend. Then I remembered being told about a trip my ex went on to her moms home state in January, so I confronted her. She told me \u201cit\u2019s none of my business who her mom is friends with or how they know eachother\u201d. I then asked downright if they were sleeping together. She said no. So after some thought and a few days I messaged her husband and asked if she was there at the same time as my ex, and surprise they were. So I sent him the picture of the picture of my ex groping a women\u2019s thigh, and her husband immediately recognized her boots. He confronted her and she admitted that they met up but \u201cnothing happened\u201d and that the picture of him groping her leg was taken intentionally to hurt me. I also found out that they have been seeing each other as recently as 2 weeks after I moved out. I\u2019m not mad at my ex, as I knew he was sleeping with someone I just didn\u2019t know it was my friend. Plus, I also had a new boyfriend too. \n\nSo, I\u2019m in a new relationship and extremely happy, so I don\u2019t care much about them sleeping together. I more-so care that my friend has been lying to me and disparaging me about hearing things because she didn\u2019t want to get caught. I also found out from the husband after he went through her phone that she was sending him screen shots of our private conversations. Essentially, I\u2019d be crying on her shoulder and she\u2019d run back and tell him. Which kind of broke me. It was an amicable divorce, but there was still pain and private feelings I shared with my friend that I would have never wanted my ex to know because he was a bit emotionally abusive, so the idea what he knew he was still able to illicit feelings from me when I hid them so well was the biggest betrayal.", "created_utc": 1683579092, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c4eg5/aita_for_telling_my_best_friends_husband_shes/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get you're upset she lied to you, but then just cut ties and be done with it. I don't see a reason to involve her husband unless you were specifically looking to get her into trouble.

By what you posted here, it doesn't sound like \\*she\\* told you it was her in the photo. So, if you didn't know it was her, what made you think to send that to her husband?", "Because that was the only picture of my ex with a girl that was posted when he was on that trip.
