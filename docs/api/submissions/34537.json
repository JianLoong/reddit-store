I have an older brother, Marcus (M31).\n\nHe has three kids, F16, F6 and M4. His eldest, who we'll call Elle, has a different mother to the other two kids.\n\nElle's mom, Katy (F32) was simply not cut out to be a mom. Elle was primarily raised by Marcus and my parents. Katy came back into her life by the time she was 12ish and she'd occasionally have Elle for weekends although they often don't get along. They have a court agreement and Elle's primary residence is with Marcus and his current wife, Laura (F30). They are not allowed to do certain things without coming to an agreement with Katy or she can take them to court, such as changing Elle's school or taking her out of the country.\n\nLaura has been egging Marcus about going on family vacation with the kids and a couple of months ago they asked Katy if it would be okay if they took Elle with them on an overseas vacation over Winter break. Katy refused, and said that she's concerned the country they're going to is unsafe. This caused multiple arguments between Laura and Marcus, as Laura wants to go on the vacation without Elle and she can just stay with her mom.\n\nEventually that is just what they did. On the 3rd day of their 2 week vacation, Elle turned up at my house in tears and asked if she could stay with me. She explained that she and her mom had a massive argument and she can't handle being around her right now. She said that one of her younger stepsiblings (F13) used her laptop without asking and had downloaded a virus onto it while trying to download minecraft, causing her to lose a lot of very important schoolwork that was assigned over the break.\n\nI let Elle inside and I contacted Katy. We spoke on the phone and she said she's okay with Elle staying with me but asked me to encourage her to go home. I then texted Marcus to let him know what happened and he told me that Elle should go home to her mom. I responded and told him Elle really doesn't want to go home and Katy is okay with it, he left me on read.\n\nElle ended up staying with me for the rest of the vacation and we had a lot of fun together. When Marcus, Laura and the kids got back, Marcus was not happy with me. He said I've been \"rewarding Elle for sh*tty behavior\" and that she can't run away to my house whenever she's had a squabble with someone. We had a long conversation and i made the point that Elle is going to be an adult very soon and he could be jeopardising their relationship.

I think your brother should go back to court and get full custody because katy doesn't seem to have elle's best interest at heart.", "NTA. Your brother should be glad Elle has a trusted adult in her life that she considers a safe space. It's not like she's refusing to go back to her mother's ever, right? What's the situation like there - does she have her own space to escape to if frustrated? Was Katy punishing the stepsister for using the laptop without permission?\n\nHonestly, it's really screwed up that the rest of your brother's family went on some big vacation out of the country and were just like, \"Well, let's not let Katy ruin it for all of us!\" Is she treated equally to her siblings other than this? They're off having fun while she's left behind in a situation where her property isn't being respected (a 13 yo should know better than to download random files online). She spent time on homework that she had to redo because of her stepsister, while she might be seeing fun family photos excluding her. So long as her mother was okay with her staying with you (primarily so there wouldn't be custody agreement issues), Elle deserved to enjoy her winter vacation, too.", "NTA, sounds like your brother might be being a little harsh, Elle already had to miss out on the family vacation, then on top of that had to deal with her step sibking ruining her work. She deserved to be somewhere she was comfortable.", "NTA. It's good that she has a safe place to go. Her mum doesn't seem very good and it's fortunate she has you to turn to. Your brother needs to see that", "NTA you did everything right. You contacted the mother so she wouldn\u2019t worry. You got the mother\u2019s approval. You offered the kid a safe place when she needed one. God knows what would have happened if you forced her back to her mother.", "NTA at all. You are the only one who really cares what Elle wants or needs. Thankyou for being there when everyone else just looked to their own egos. She needs a safe space away from her troublesome steps and her dad who just wants to follow the rules... It's really kind that you have been that safe space.", "NTA. Elle was upset, and you helped her out when she needed support. You did what family does. Marcus seems a bit harsh. It's not about making the world revolve around Elle but being there when she needs it.", "NTA. You seem to be the only person not ripping that child up between bitter adults. She doesn't deserve any of that treatment. She has a mother who loves to control what she does, and makes her miss out on things, and a step-mother who loves leaving her behind, and a dad who wants to punish her for being frustrated and unhappy. Keep being the sane person she can count on for good advice, and a safe place to land. She needs both to get out in this world and start making her way, and knowing she's got strong support makes it happen!", "NTA. Your brother and Laura need an attitude adjustment on the meaning of \u201cfamily vacation\u201d and how to treat family members. They\u2019re the assholes.", "NTA please inform Katy and Marcus AND Laura they need to extricate their collective heads from their own ass\\*s", "NTA\n\nKids need to feel safe; you provided that safety. It might be a good idea to gently let Marcus know that being at Katy's house jeopardized Elle's schoolwork and did damage to a rather expensive laptop. Recommend that he sit Elle down and just listen to her about her situation--give her a chance to let her father know how she feels about going to her mom's.\n\nAlso, this child needs therapy.", "NTA.

My bet is the trip destination was intentionally selected so his daughter couldn't go. When she turns 18 or when she goes to college OPs brother is going to be surprised when his daughter cuts him out of her life.", "NTA \n\nIf she came to you because she felt safe with you and didn\u2019t want to be home at that time, that\u2019s her choice.

It\u2019s disappointing that they still went on vacation then got mad at this situation.", "Going back to court is almost pointless at this stage. She's 16 now, next holiday she's 17. That the last holiday her mom can interfere with. Instead, keep the cash that would have been spent on going to court and treat her to an extra special holiday when she turns 18.", "And I\u2019d like to point out at 16, she is going to still need time away when she\u2019s upset and they are lucky she went to family instead of disappearing with friends. Having a trusted family member at 16 can make or break her teenage experience and keep her from the wrong path", "I know, he chose to leave her behind and then was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being nice to my daughter!\u201d What is his problem? I can understand if Katy never let Elle go ANYWHERE. Maybe you\u2019d do a vacation without her. I can\u2019t really comment on that. But doing a huge international trip when she\u2019s not allowed to go? That sucks. And it sucks even more that he has zero sympathy for her situation with her mom.", "Please excuse my ignorance as i never studied english in school, but what does jettisoned means?", "That sounds good too. To me it seems so wrong that someone who abandoned her for 12 years gets to have a say in her life.", "True. At that age, and especially coming from a broken family, with divorced parents, it's very easy for teenagers to go in the wrong direction.", "Especially with Elle being 16 - it's not long until she'll be 18 and custody agreements will no longer matter. They should've stayed in the country if international travel was only okay with Katy's permission or figured out a less objectionable country to visit. A two year wait for that country wouldn't hurt.", "It means weight is dumped off from a ship or aircraft, I used it figuratively as they left this one child behind because she was inconvenience to their holiday plan.\n\nFor example, aircraft might jettison (dump) fuel reserves before crash landing to minimize change of explosion.\n\nOr a sinking ship might jettison (throw overboard) cargo to lighten the ship and slow down sinking.", "That\u2019s so true! 2 years is nothing really when it comes to planning a big trip. They could do something small that Katy would allow for now and save/plan for a big trip in just 2 years. But hey. Instead let\u2019s punish Elle for her mom and then call OP an AH for not punishing Elle further for things that have nothing to do with her and allowing her to feel safe while her dad is out of town.", "I understand it now. Thank you, and again, excuse me for asking. But when you learn a language from tv, some words get by you"]}
