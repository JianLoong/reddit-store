It's a long story of how I found out but just to be clear yes I'm sure she is mine. I've been trying to get to know her and she stays with me a lot. I've decided this is the right time to introduce her to my family. I have a big family with so many siblings and niblings. They know about my daughter and some of them have met her but some of my siblings that I'm not very close to or live in another city haven't met her yet.\n\nMy siblings and I stay the entire holiday in our parents home and this year I'm taking my daughter with me. Every christmas my siblings make a list of gifts. This list is for all the kids in the family and it's designed so that every kid will have the same gifts and no one will get upset that someone else is getting a better gift. It's also designed so that all my siblings, even the ones who don't have good jobs can afford it.\n\nMy sister sent me this years list and told me this is what I should get for my child this year. I looked at the list and it was mostly clothes and like one toy of our choice. I told her I'm sorry but  this is my daughters first christmas with me and I'm not gonna get such shitty gifts for her. I have my own list. She argued that every kid is the family is getting these gifts and getting anything but these will make other kids upset and I told her I don't care. \n\nThe other issue is that my siblings usually go there by train. I used to go with them but it's a very long way and tiring so I told her that this year I'll get plane tickets for me and kiddo which made her more mad and she called me an asshole. She has told all my siblings and most of them are calling me an asshole for not thinking about how their children will feel if I do this.

I understand all the kids wanting to feel equal but nobody should be dictating what gifts a parent wants to give to their own child. This is not real equality, it's controlling.\n\nPersonally, I think the real issue here is how to show your daughter that she's special and that you want to celebrate her being part of the family, without making it seem like she's better than the other kids. This would make her uncomfortable and the other kids would probably get resentful and think of her as an outsider.\n\nMy advice is to go for something sentimental. Maybe make something that can tie in significance to your family and something special to her, or maybe make something that she really enjoys that different family members can contribute to. This could be something like a charm bracelet where different family members pick a charm, baking or cooking something together (with her potentially) or making a new family scrapbook with her own section, starting with the first photo you have together and maybe adding in a picture that you took that day with your family. You could show her the family's history and show that she's apart of it now. \n\nHope this helps and congrats!

They are going to resent her if she suddenly becomes the long-lost golden child who gets her own special and better gifts. Don't put her in this position; it isn't fair.\n\nInstead, have your own private Christmas celebration -- just the two of you -- either before or after the big family get together. Don't make it just about gifts, though. I don't remember many of the specific gifts I've gotten over the years but I remember all of my family's Christmas Eve traditions (singing Christmas carols, reading our old pop-up book of The Night Before Christmas, preparing a plate of cookies and carrots for Santa and his reindeer.)

It'd be nicer if you'd all agree on a number of gifts and a price range while everyone is together and getting anything extra at home. \nBut this is the tradition, it has been for years, so you can't just demand to change it because your situation changed. It would be nice if your siblings would acknowledge that your child is new and they'd do something special for her, they can explain it to their kids as 'this isn't a Christmas present, but a welcome to the family thing'. \n\nThe point of a big family Christmas isn't presents, but being together.

If you are trying to assimilate your daughter into your family, you are off to a bad start. Making her feel like part of the family is exposing her to the traditions and experiences that the rest of your family have done for years.

You could follow \"the list\" for appearance, and do additional gifts separately and privately. I would not make this a habit.

More than anything I am sure you want your daughter to feel like part of your family. Treat her the same - special treatment will just make her feel \"other\".

Honestly, that's not healthy at all, you might be stopping the kids feeling bad but, I also think this might be teaching them the wrong lesson too, that other people should always put their feelings first.
