It's a long story of how I found out but just to be clear yes I'm sure she is mine. I've been trying to get to know her and she stays with me a lot. I've decided this is the right time to introduce her to my family. I have a big family with so many siblings and niblings. They know about my daughter and some of them have met her but some of my siblings that I'm not very close to or live in another city haven't met her yet.\n\nMy siblings and I stay the entire holiday in our parents home and this year I'm taking my daughter with me. Every christmas my siblings make a list of gifts. This list is for all the kids in the family and it's designed so that every kid will have the same gifts and no one will get upset that someone else is getting a better gift. It's also designed so that all my siblings, even the ones who don't have good jobs can afford it.\n\nMy sister sent me this years list and told me this is what I should get for my child this year. I looked at the list and it was mostly clothes and like one toy of our choice. I told her I'm sorry but  this is my daughters first christmas with me and I'm not gonna get such shitty gifts for her. I have my own list. She argued that every kid is the family is getting these gifts and getting anything but these will make other kids upset and I told her I don't care. \n\nThe other issue is that my siblings usually go there by train. I used to go with them but it's a very long way and tiring so I told her that this year I'll get plane tickets for me and kiddo which made her more mad and she called me an asshole. She has told all my siblings and most of them are calling me an asshole for not thinking about how their children will feel if I do this. Only 2 of my siblings are on my side and the rest think I'm an ahole\n\nEdit: after reading the comments and thinking about it more I decided not to go there for christmas. I want to give her the best christmas possible and I can't do that if I'm focused on how everyone else is going to feel about it. We'll go there for a day or 2 so that she can meet the family though. She actually looked relieved when I told her lol. I guess she was bervous about spending so much time with people who are basically strangers to her. I'll talk to her mom and see if we can give her a christmas with both her parents instead", "created_utc": 1669018693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0thp1/aita_for_doing_what_i_want_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 4267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand all the kids wanting to feel equal but nobody should be dictating what gifts a parent wants to give to their own child. This is not real equality, it's controlling.\n\nPersonally, I think the real issue here is how to show your daughter that she's special and that you want to celebrate her being part of the family, without making it seem like she's better than the other kids. This would make her uncomfortable and the other kids would probably get resentful and think of her as an outsider.\n\nMy advice is to go for something sentimental. Maybe make something that can tie in significance to your family and something special to her, or maybe make something that she really enjoys that different family members can contribute to. This could be something like a charm bracelet where different family members pick a charm, baking or cooking something together (with her potentially) or making a new family scrapbook with her own section, starting with the first photo you have together and maybe adding in a picture that you took that day with your family. You could show her the family's history and show that she's apart of it now. \n\nHope this helps and congrats!

They are going to resent her if she suddenly becomes the long-lost golden child who gets her own special and better gifts. Don't put her in this position; it isn't fair.\n\nInstead, have your own private Christmas celebration -- just the two of you -- either before or after the big family get together. Don't make it just about gifts, though. I don't remember many of the specific gifts I've gotten over the years but I remember all of my family's Christmas Eve traditions (singing Christmas carols, reading our old pop-up book of The Night Before Christmas, preparing a plate of cookies and carrots for Santa and his reindeer.)

It'd be nicer if you'd all agree on a number of gifts and a price range while everyone is together and getting anything extra at home. \nBut this is the tradition, it has been for years, so you can't just demand to change it because your situation changed.

You might be feeling guilty and showering your daughter with gifts is the way you are trying to compensate. But what you should try to achieve is making her part of the family.   \nThis is a tradition trying to treat each child equal so no one compares presents and no one feels left out. If a child suddenly gets favored the children will probably not understand and may resent her - so you are essentially setting up your own child to be left out instead of giving her a chance to connect with her new family. And this is overall not a good way to celebrate a holiday when people suddenly disregard tradition then there is gonna be conflict - so do you want tension or a happy family celebration? How do you want your daughter to remember this holiday? \n\nI mean everyone already gave you a great solution. Give her presents when you are alone. You might deem it very important to receive the presents on the exact time - but you know I received presents on the day after the day and so on because we couldn't always celebrate with the whole family but would visit on the days after.

I assume you've heard of him. \n\nKids means a lot of different ages and maturity levels. So one 9-year-old might believe in Santa and one 9-year-old might not.  \n\nTLDR.  Santa is a special idea that should be preserved. A wide disparity in gifts from Santa makes kids believe that perhaps they haven't been good enough.\n\nWe have a mixed elementary school in my neighborhood, many of the kids qualify for free lunch, and many of the kids don't. So Christmas means a wide gamut of different things to the different children.\n\nI do not work at the school, but I interface a lot with the school because we have foster children which means you tend to be up at the school a lot more often than regular parents.  Also, these points sink home because often our foster child has foster siblings in other households, that we try to coordinate visits and family time with.\n\nSanta is a special idea. The school sends homes materials, sealed materials, to the households explaining to families that it would be very helpful if children who know Santa isn't real could share in the secret of Santa and keep the secret from the kids who still believe. This is part of the \"Spirit of Christmas\".  We talk to our kids and let them know that just as Santa in the mall is one of Santa's helpers, that keeping the secret of Santa, sharing the Spirit of Christmas is being one of Santa's helpers.\n\nAlso, Christmas is a complex thing.  Kids get gifts from Santa, gifts from grandparents, gifts from friends, and gifts from their parents. Since our school district is very mixed, the school recommends that parents keep a cap on gifts from Santa. It is very distressing to a child when their classmates have gotten iPads and PlayStations from Santa and they got something that wasn't a big ticket item.  Weren't they good enough? Why doesn't Santa love them? There's no reason why Santa can't give more reasonable items, which is exactly what your family is suggesting. While parents give big ticket items.  \n\nAs an adult, it can be hard to put yourself back in the mindset of a child. But please remember that keeping the Spirit of Christmas alive can be really important. Also, it's very traumatic that the type of gift you received from Santa might make you feel less than others, or not as good as others. \n\nYour siblings have set up these rules so that none of the children feel left out, or feel like they aren't good enough. It's great that you are able to spoil your daughter, but please do it at your home.  Don't belittle your niblings hearts, minds, and holiday with your generosity.\n\n\nFYI.  I personally HATE Christmas, but when we have foster children I decorate and celebrate with the best of them.  There's a magic to Christmas that we can only see in the eyes of children.", "Honestly it sounds like they're training these kids to throw a fit if everything isn't 100% fair. \n\nLife doesn't work that way, I understand you want Christmas to just be happy, but if these kids were trained earlier they could just focus on their own stuff and ignore their relatives gifts. \n\nI grew up poor, always saw rich kids with nice things, I am so glad I learned to be happy without expensive things rather than being one of those people who is constantly envious. Kids should learn to savor the good things and move on from the things that upset them.", "This is such really good solution that won\u2019t alienate her from her cousins. \n\nShe\u2019s already going to feel like an outsider, and kids are merciless when they think someone has it better than them.

You don't care about your family, your daughter or tradition, you only care about buying your child's affection and making sure that everyone of your siblings and niblings know that you are doing it. \n\nMy father was one of 7. Every other year we would do \"Christmas\" with that side. When I was younger it involved all going to my grandparents... then in the later years we rented a cabin. Imagine 30-40 people piling into an old home with one bathroom. The cabin was actually an upgrade, there were 3 bathrooms (but we had grown to around 50ish too).  It was exactly how you would imagine it... too many people and not enough space... and it was magical. There was 1 brother whose wife refused to stay with the group. They would come over for a couple hours and then go back to her parents' house. We were not \"mean\" to them, but they knew they were different and missed out on a lot of crazy memories. It was a running joke, you went into the week loving everyone, left annoyed with everyone, and it took two years to get excited about going back again. \n\nWe weren't quite as rigid as your family with gifts, but most presents were done at home either before or after we came. We always did a name exchange (one for adults, one for the kids), so there were always presents under the tree (that we chopped down and decorated while there). One main reason to not give her expensive gifts around her cousins is that I promise you, it will get lost, broken or fights will break out.  The other, your daughter will be ostracized. If you are insistent on ignoring your family tradition, just don't go. Otherwise, put your ego aside and have fun. I promise you, your daughter will not think less of you if she get's her Christmas gifts before or after (or both).", "NTA", "NTA but at the same time I can see their point.  We get around stuff like this by opening extra gifts on a different day and having our own celebration. We usually do it early so the kids have more time to play with their fun stuff and that way no one has any hurt feelings.", "INFO: Is there any reason at all that you can't give your daughter other gifts in private, away from your extended family?", "NTA equal is not fair. Different kids with different parents deserve different gifts. Protecting a child from potential disappointment is not serving the kids well for the future.", "YTA. Honestly if that\u2019s the tradition then you should probably follow it. You making her \u201cspecial\u201d will only breed resentment among the cousins which will make future holidays and get togethers miserable for your daughter. You also run the risk of turning your child into a spoilt brat by always telling her she\u2019s more special or deserves more then her cousins (also trying to \u201cmake up\u201d for the last 10 years runs the same risk). Which could also make your life especially difficult down the line if you have more children. \n\nPlease if you want her to feel special, do a second Christmas with her just the two of you. Maybe a new family tradition together. As a child I had two Christmas\u2019 due to divorce each year. Trust me it is still magical and exciting being on a different day. Gifts should also not be a focus but a bonus of the day. In our house, in and around Christmas, we make Christmas cookies together, we make a new ornament each year (make sure you date the back of the ornaments) It\u2019s so fun to look at them each year as you decorate the tree. Obviously we decorate the tree, usually while singing carols (badly). The morning of we have a special breakfast, one so bad for you it\u2019s a super special once a year feast. We always got a movie or board game as a gift that we\u2019d watch/play during the afternoon. Typically done in brand new fluffy PJs. Then either a big feast away or at home . Followed by a fun dessert of the homemade xmas cookies and squares and other treats. Ones that were only made once per year. The second part of the day was with the cousins, and getting to see them and play with them was always extra fun because we were super close. It\u2019s these memories that are what I remember and crave each year, the gifts are still just a bonus to an already amazing day.", "I think the appropriate thing to do in this case would be to explain the tradition to your daughter. Then she'll know that she's being treated like every other child in the family, which I would imagine, if presented correctly, would be  a comfort and reassurance to her - that she's being integrated into the family as exactly equal to her cousins, and nobody thinks of her as any less than that.   \n\n\nHowever, if you wanted to have a special Christmas with just her, then you should buy her something nice and present it to her privately, as a gift from daddy, apart from the family Christmas.   \n\n\nReally, though, I would caution you to not fall into the trap of trying to buy your daughter's love. The experience of Christmas with her newfound family should be what makes it special, not getting an expensive toy she won't remember later. This is the time to start setting the expectation that the quality of time and love you give each other all be what defines your father-daughter relationship. Don't teach her that your love is equal to the money you spend on her.   \n\n\nI think skipping the train ride might be cheating your daughter of extended interaction with the other kids, but if you're convinced that it's the right move for your daughter, then it shouldn't be that big of an issue. Your siblings also have to understand that this is a special case and some allowances should be made. There's a fair point about not creating resentment among the cousins this early in the meeting process, though. You've got to be careful here.   \n\n\nI think an extended, amicable discussion about this with the adults is going to be necessary in order to make sure this is handled properly with the children.", "NTA. Obviously you shouldnt have the child open the expensive presents in front of the niblings,  but get any present you want for the child.", "Nta", "NTA but you can giver her your special gifts when its just the two of you.", "NAH give your kid the same presents as everyone else, plus the extra ones when you\u2019re at home or your niblings aren\u2019t around. Having her open the extra gifts in front of the others wouldn\u2019t be fair.", "NTA my husband is the second oldest of 9! We have over 12 niblings. We teach our children that not everyone gets the same things. You could suggest doing something like my family and when at the big family get together the cousins all exchange gifts. The gifts can\u2019t total over $20 but they gift things to each other! They each pick a name out of a hat at Christmas and then next year that is their person to give a gift to and they get gifts from the grandparents.
