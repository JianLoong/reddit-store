She was able to get us back to the shallow end with no help because the \"lifeguards\" on duty were teens who were hanging out in the other building and didn't hear me screaming for help. \n\nNTA. It could save his life one day. As you know, sadly.", "NTA. I know some people may say the kid doesn't want to do, but knowing how to swim is important, it's not like your forcing your kid to take it up as a full time sport. Why doesn't your husband communicate with you, respect your money, and why is he throwing you under the bus as a parent? Because now your son will know that he can just go to dad when be doesn't want to do something. You definitely need to talk to your husband about this and BOTH of you need to reiterate to your son why it's important (it's also important to teach kids about keeping your word on commitments)", "Your husband is the AH. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

I understand you may be frustrated but ultimately it is the adults responsibility to make sure they\u2019re getting to their lessons on time. I would be pissed at my husband not my kid. And its a bit cruel to tell your kid you\u2019re gonna take their money for a lesson that YOU want them to take. Maybe try scheduling the lessons at a later time if possible so that way you or your husband have time to rest and can take your kid later on in the day. \n\nI guess I will say NTA but I think you should  apologize to your kid because you were being mean and misdirected your anger at them.

Your husband isn't around for weekday childcare so you take on that responsibility but being away from home 5 days a week can be just as tiring and shattering. I agree with you that children who live around water should learn to swim but you need to consider your husband's need for downtime at home as much as you do your own. You have more household / parenting work during the week but any time you get to yourself is in the comfort of your home. Your husband doesn't get that on Friday when he returns, Saturday morning is his decompression at home time.\n\nYour husband shouldn't promise something and not do it, even if he doesn't put the same importance on that thing that you do. You should be able to trust your spouse to do as they say they will and you can't.\n\nYou need to talk honestly about what you can each manage, you about being shattered for maintaining the household with no help for 5 out of 7 days and your husband about why he doesn't understand why you feel swimming lessons are important or why he's too tired to go. I get the feeling he doesn't understand why you're shattered and you don't understand why he wants to be home. Maybe your children need to pick two clubs or activities each so you do 3 chauffeur runs per week with your husband doing one on Friday, maybe you need housework help, maybe your husband is lazy, maybe your husband needs time at home. Who knows? I don't, there's not enough information but I don't matter. You and your husband need to sort it out together, he sucks for promising and not delivering and you do for not considering being away from home isn't necessarily restful for him.

Also I see it as not only your child missing out on life saving lessons but if they are not there some other child could have these lessons instead.", "YTA. Your son should not be expected to pay for swimming lessons that you want him to take. As a parent, those costs are your responsibility.

At all. Learning to be safe in water is a vital skill for any child. But your husband has clearly shown that he is not reliable for getting your child to swimming lessons, so just ignore what he says and do it yourself.", "I don't think there's a right answer here.

You knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen you just hoped it would.\n\nHowever you want to resolve this with your hubby that\u2019s on you but having someone else pay for not attending lessons does not result in your child knowing how to swim. \n\nThat being said your hubby is an AH for saying he was going to do something and not following through.", "YTA- just start taking the kid yourself if it is important to you. Also, if the kid is not interested, I think you should stop the classes. I get your point that swimming is an important skill and sorry that you missed learning as a kid.

Based on schedules, my ex signed up my kids always on Saturday morning (always my time with them based on 50/50 schedule) and there were times where I literally had to carry them like sacks of potatoes into the studio or pool kicking and screaming. I hated it, my daughter's hated it, and after months i finally put my foot down and said I will support extra curricular things, but no more Saturday mornings.

If it is so important to OP (which I get) suck it up buttercup.", "I agree. swimming is important but this seems like your kid is communicating that this is too much. Saturday morning is the time that your family has to take it easy, which is why this isn't working Having some down time is important too. You are nta currently, but need to be flexible on the scheduling issue here.", "He\u2019s absolutely not running kids to activities as much as me. Saturday morning is the only weekend activity. I do cubs on a Monday, karate on a Tuesday, dungeons and dragons on a Wednesday, Thursday is an evening off, Fridays is rugby and karate. Plus any dentist, doctor, optician and school appointments are me as well.\n\nWhen he works away he stays in a hotel. He doesn\u2019t cook, clean or run the household.\n\nAll the other activities are ones that my kids asked to do; swimming is the only one that I insist on. I won\u2019t take away things that they want to do.", "Yeah that makes sense don\u2019t worry. NTA, the setup you have is one that\u2019ll work. Every child and adult should have the ability to swim. I believe I took lessons until I was at least 10 and now I\u2019m the best swimmer in my family. I wouldn\u2019t take the money from your kid though, your husband needs to take responsibility.", "You don't see it as a necessary life skill for yourself. When kids are young they don't always realize that the basics of swimming need to be learned. Chilldren and even adults can drown because they are naive and think that certain areas are safe to wade in or they saw their friends swimming so why can't they? This leads to tragic consequences that could be prevented. I would want my kids to know how to swim in calm waters of a pool or lake, the currents of river, and the potentially more dangerous waters of the ocean.", "NTA - swimming is a life skill , like cooking, cleaning etc.\n\nYour husband chosing to be lazy isn't an excuse.  It a parents job to take children to events like this, to teach the child to follow the schedule and meet committments", "Are we sure the dad is the asshole? You all sound super over scheduled. Maybe laying around Saturday mornings and relaxing is what you all actually need\u2026  I hope you schedule a family wide lazy time that you get to enjoy with them\u2026", "ESH apart from your son. If it's that important to you, and your husband can't be bothered, you should be taking your child to swimming lessons.", "Nta", "NTA - I come from a family of firefighters and first responders and water safety was one of the biggest things pounded into me as a kid. Unfortunately, drowning is very common and it can happen so so fast. It is incredibly important imo that everyone know how to swim and have water safety", "I agree with swimming lessons being essential. If your kids are ever going to be around water they need to learn how to be able to save themselves, if necessary. I can't swim and, as a result, am fearful of water and was totally paranoid about taking my nieces and nephews anywhere around deep  water before they learned how to swim because I knew I wouldn't be able help them if they got in trouble while in the water.", "We usually do that Saturday afternoons. Today we watched The Martian.", "Yep, a couple of other people have said this. I\u2019m going to take him from now on.", "ESH both parents are responsible for taking the kids to their swimming lessons. BOTH of you were too lazy to bother.", "Hey mama, you sound like you're trying really hard to take good care of your children and that's awesome! But one concerned mom to another: I've had to remind myself multiple times that just because my kids' lives are different than mine was, doesn't necessarily mean they're worse. Yes it's important for them to get to spend time with friends - but it's also important for them to spend time with their siblings and parents, and time to play on their own too. If the total activity load for your family is too much, then it's 100% okay to choose an activity or two to cut back. Learning to swim is important yes - but perhaps you could rotate it in next season rather than adding it on top now. You still have a lot of 'hands-on' parenting years ahead of you, so learning how to pace yourself will help keep everything running smoother - and keep you feeling less overburdened. Best wishes!", "Is your son even interested in swimming lessons?", "Aaaand now I\u2019m crying. Thank you, that was really beautiful.", "Yes. He loves to swim. When I take him, he is initially resistant because he\u2019s a small boy and would quite cheerfully live the rest of his life eating cheese in his pants. But when we get there, he skips in happily, has a great time, and usually gets a hot chocolate afterwards.", "Just be glad your kid is only in lessons. I did swim team from 8-16. 8am every day of summer for four years. 7am every day of summer for the next four.", "NTA", "NTA.  I'm sorry to hear of your friend that drowned.  Swimming lessons should not be optional, at least until each child is skilled enough to keep themselves safe.", "NTA.....\n\nAt all!", "Why do you believe your husband when he disappoints you. \nIf the lessons are important to you then you wake up and take your kid. \n\nIt's what I do. Despite working full-time and looking after household and chores. If something is important to me I prioritise it.", "OP=NTA\n\nHe agreed to take child and then did not follow thru--he lost your money, he owes you that money.\n\nBut it sounds like you need to rearrange some things..  Make sure you aren't so shattered, by putting more of the household load at his feet.", "Her husband said he'd do it then didn't. If he'd said no she would have set an alarm and done it.", "may i suggest waiting on the baileys/coffee until after you get back home...", "NTA. I have a message for your husband:\n\n\ud83d\udc4fTEACH\ud83d\udc4fYOUR\ud83d\udc4fCHILDREN\ud83d\udc4fHOW\ud83d\udc4fTO\ud83d\udc4fSWIM\ud83d\udc4f\n\nYour husband is a *massive* AH for this, even without your drowning related loss. Swimming is a vital skill if you expect that your children will ever in their life be around bodies of water bigger than a bathtub. The number of *idiots* I've seen dragged out of the ocean and pools because they didn't know how to swim but assumed they magically had the knowledge or just went a little too far out is *staggering*.\n\nAlso, I'm sure it's part of the lessons curriculum, but make sure there is, at some point, a fully clothed lesson, where they have to swim a distance and climb out of deep water without a ladder fully dressed. This will teach your children exactly how dangerous and heavy clothing can be and prepare them for if they end up in the water unexpectedly.", "YTA. It's definitely not your kid's fault, so he shouldn't be paying for it. And the solution if your husband isn't consistent is to do it yourself, because you're the one who thinks it's important (I agree with you on that, but since you decided to sign him up, you need to take him).", "NTA\n\nSwimming is a necessary skill.   A lot of people die from drowning or suffer from swimming related issues. I.e. cousin is a C3-C4 quadriplegic and nearly drowned due to diving in shallow water.  This happened 20 years ago.  Water safety is essential.\n\nMy daughter is special needs and she takes swimming lessons, as well. My husband is kind of like yours.  He nearly made her miss a lesson but I got pissed so that ain't happening again.\n\nSo yea, I understand your frustration.", "Kids forget everything when they miss one week. Your swim instructor has to work extra hard to help him make progress every time he misses a lesson, so it's not just a waste of money, it's a waste of progress as well. NTA", "NTA", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nMy mother was not a strong swimmer. Because my aunt and uncle spent a lot of time at the lake with their boat and we went with them a lot. My mother was adamant that my brother and I learned to swim. I was 4 when I started, they didn\u2019t have water babies at the time so my brother started taking lessons two years later. It was one of the best things she ever did for us and she did a lot.\n\nThis same aunt and uncle had a small pond on their property. My cousin put her son in water babies. When he was about 2, he climbed up on a lawn chair that was on the dock. It collapsed and he went in the water. As my cousin jumped in to get him he had already reached the surface on his own.\n\nEdit: Swimming lessons are important if you live near any body of water.", "NTA I took both formal swimming lessons and I was taught by my grandfather and it does come in handy as you never know when you will need the skill.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
