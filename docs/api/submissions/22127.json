You don't understand how bodyshops work if you expect people to believe that a full paint job was scheduled in and completed in the week you were gone. Zero chance a shop would work on a car if the customer was not the title holder, without making an effort to contact the title holder.", "NTA - sue that fucker, and get a restraining order. While you're at it, perhaps some memory supplements?", "WTF? That guy is absolutely insane.\nNTA.", "Was it a full re-spray or a wrap? A wrap I can believe. A full re-spray with decent workmanship would need to be done at a shop and cost thousands and would need time for the clearcoats to cure. If its a wrap, have it removed.", "NTA \n\nYou do realize that he committed a crime and so did the shop that painted it. Having him pay to change the color back is the least of it. If it was a brand new car it came with a warranty. That warranty may now be voided due to work done by someone other than a dealer. This isn\u2019t just about the color of a car. Take your warranty and photos of the car before and after to a lawyer and find out how this is going to affect you in the future.\n\nOff the top of my head you face issues with warranty, title, registration and insurance. All of those are for your VIN number for a red automobile. Now when someone changes the color of a brand new car usually it is because they were in an accident with damage and ran or didn\u2019t report the damage and changed the color so the car can\u2019t be identified. (My Mom worked for an insurance company for over 35 years.)\n\nYour friend thinks it\u2019s funny. The reality is that he\u2019s screwed you in ways you haven\u2019t even thought of yet. See a lawyer so they can tell you how you fix all the paperwork for your car. Do it before you get pulled over by a cop.", "Listen, someone taking someone else\u2019s car and getting it painted to suit them is just plain crazy. If this is for real, you need to lose this weirdo. Also, body shops will absolutely paint whatever at whatever time . They like money.  This is crazy and that dude is literally out of his mind. Again, if true, this is a giant warning sign. Now, if he vinyl wrapped it, that would have been funny. You can just peel that off. Is it vinyl wrapped?", "NTA I would've painted his car yellow and brown for starving my cats", "NTA Wtf.", "NTA. \n\nA real friend that wealthy would\u2019ve just bought you a new car.", "Ah....you don't need a title to have work done on a car. Only to have it inspected. That's the only time they will ask. Unless it's a service call to unlock the car. \n\nSeriously? Do you show the title for you car when you go to have work done? \n\nMy family owns an automatic store. I worked as the delivery driver for many years when I was young. I was very familiar with how mechanics and autobody shops work. \n\nIf you bring a car in for work no one is asking for the cars title.

The point is no one is demanding the title when you bring a car in to have stuff done.", "Do you have a chance to win this case??", "In that case, I would def see what your lawyer says about this.", "Wouldn't you drive the car to your parents' house? How did your friend get your keys?", "Thank you, I\u2019ll update it.", "Thank God, the cats would be horrified to be outed as a part of this mess", "In another response you said the paint shop didn't care. \n\nThere's no way your car got prepped and painted in a week,  which is why I said wrapped,  but you didn't deny it being wrapped. \n\nAlso, you like to post pics,  Mustang Bros can't stop themselves from posting pics of their cars,  you have no pics of your car,  car is a lie \n\nWhole story is bullshit.", "Sorry for all the questioning.  It's just hard to believe that someone would actually do this, even though I read this sub every day. Like, why does he care so much?  Weirdo.

Jeez, your a typical redditor.", "Some people take things to far. I think he had a bit of a condition. Maybe he couldn\u2019t stand seeing it in the parking lot?
