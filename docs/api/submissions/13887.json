Recently they began to comment that I have never had a boyfriend.\n\nTo start, Jane said a local shop is hiring, and I should apply because it would be a great place to meet boys. I said thanks, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend. Joe then started saying how I should try to find someone soon before it's too late. I tried to joke it off, saying I don't need a man, and a boyfriend sounded like work. After they left, I told my parents that I didn't like those comments, and they made me uncomfortable. My parents agreed it was strange but said I shouldn't overthink it. They came over again and pushed the discussion of relationships and how I should find a boyfriend. I tried to make a joke, saying I was asked out, but turned it down. My parents seemed surprised, so I told a story about how two different guys asked me out but I turned them down because they made me uncomfortable. Jane said I should at least go on a date with them because I don't know when I'll be asked again. I became angry and told them I would rather be single than date someone who made me feel uncomfortable. Joe disagreed saying it didn't matter; I should've taken the offers. I mentioned again to my parents how uncomfortable I was with these comments, but again, I was told to ignore them. I asked my parents to tell them to stop making comments about my relationships.\n\nI saw them again last week. My parents pulled them aside and told them to stop making those comments as they made me uncomfortable; they agreed to stop. Later Joe asked me a question and when I didn\u2019t give him the response he wanted, he said he\u2019d ask about my boyfriend later to \"set me back to normal\" because it\u2019s so funny. After, Joe told everyone NOT to ask about any boyfriend because they \"wouldn't want me to get upset again.\u201d When Jane and Joe were leaving, they made a comment about me being alone for the rest of my life. \n\nThe final straw was tonight. My parents had a party, and Jane and Joe came. My parents agreed to remind them of my boundary and that I could leave if needed. The jokes continued. Jane said how sad my life must be and how I will die alone. I started to leave when Joe said Jane was right and it was almost pathetic that I didn't have a boyfriend yet. I was tired of them disrespecting my boundaries, so I turned to Joe and VERY loudly said, \"I think I finally understand why you and Jane keep bringing up my relationship status; it's because you're interested in me. That MUST be why you keep disrespecting my boundaries. Well, let me be clear, I am NOT interested in you, and frankly, it\u2019s creepy. You've known me since I was a child.\" I left after that. From what I've been told, they were embarrassed and left the party early.\n\nMy best friend thinks I am right, but my parents believe what I said was uncalled for and disturbing. What they said makes me feel disrespected, but maybe I was too harsh.

The first word out of their mouths about it and I would literally put my hand in their face like a stop sign and say, \"STOP! We are NOT discussing this, and if you don't respect me, I will never be in the same room as you again, literally. You walk in, and I walk out. DO YOU GET IN NOW? MY LIFE IS NOT A JOKE! STOP BULLYING ME!\" \n\nYour parents may agree, but they are enablers who refuse to shut it down. NTA", "Good boundary.", "It\u2019s a pretty good implication.", "My thoughts exactly lmfao.", "Apparently you\u2019ve never had issues and a fear of conflict. This is a big issue with my own anxiety. Conflict sends me into a panic.", "Not live through, they prey on \"vulnerable unicorns\" it sounds abusive as fuck. They get off on degrading others that they wish to sexually partake with so they can show dominance without hurting the central relationship. Older people are horny as the rest of us.", "The thing is that he would accept the date. He wouldn't take it as a joke.", "Literal LOL", "I you were my kid, I\u2019d drop those two creepy \u201cfriends\u201d so fast. What a creepy af question to KEEP on asking a young woman. Ew. I\u2019d honestly be worried for your safety. Why are people outside of your age bracket so interested?", "NTA ..how you made them feel uncomfortable..genius ..your dating life ain't there business and u clearly have your boundaries and they couldn't respect that ... They got what they deserved .. ya know what they say .. do unto others ...", "NTA,\nWow. You\u2019re parents and Joe and Jane really didn\u2019t like it when THEY were the ones made uncomfortable by the conversation. Good for you.", "Good for you for recognizing that \u201cNo man at all\u201d needs to be relatively high on your list of possible dates/BFs/partners, and that there are many men who rank further down.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  My parents friends pulled this kind of shit and worse all the time with me when I was young. i HATED it. I am glad you had the guts to stand up to them. They deserve to be shamed for that behavior.", "NTA!!\n\nits so crazy how when the tables are turned it\u2019s suddenly a problem! i am glad they got embarrassed about the whole situation and i hope it keeps them up at night", "NTA. Why are your parent\u2019s friends so concerned with your relationship status? That right there seems strange enough, they\u2019re way too invested in something that has no effect on their life.", " NTA. This is bullying.", "This seems like a made up story\u2026", "NTA you are a goddamned bootstomping legend is what you are", "NTA. That was an incredible thing to say to them. A punch right to the kisser without getting physical", "NTA.  You didn't start this fight....but you finished it.  Respect.", "NTA\n\nThis is incredibly weird and disrespectful. Maybe now they\u2019ll understand that being made to feel uncomfortable isn\u2019t something easily ignored.\n\nAnd the advice to go out with men who make you uncomfortable? Fucking ew", "NTA - tbh, you\u2019re pretty much my hero.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said *was* disturbing--just like the mess they subjected *you* to. If they can dish it out, they should be able to take it. I find it disturbing that they want to find you, a *grown woman*, a \"boy.\" Do they realize how that sounds? You are 24. Also, this isn't the 1950s. Why are they acting like being single is a crime against humanity? \n\nBut the most disturbing thing, for me, was your parents' utter refusal to protect you from their trashy friends. If it were me, I would never be anywhere where those two ghouls are, and I would seriously consider moving out of your parents' place if you still live there.", "You get what you give in this life that we live and all that you do will come back to you", "NTA. Served him right.", "NTA", "NTA, but your parents are huge assholes for saying that YOU could leave the party if you felt uncomfortable. What in the actual fuck!", "Haha, go girl, he will never make such comments to you again. Your parents sucks by the way. You are not the asshole.", "they can go get stuffed. NTA", "NTA. Honestly, this is what I would have done.", "NAH. Fuck that shit. They were warned not to make uncomfortable comments and embarrass you. Now they can have a taste of their own medicine.", "NTA. \n\nGiven the. Circumstances, you handled this perfectly OP\u2026.[chef\u2019s kiss]\n\nINFO: Is this behaviour - prodding into a young woman\u2019s personal/romantic life - normal or accepted in the culture your family is from? There\u2019s plenty of toxic social mores in many/all cultures; is your parents\u2019 friends\u2019 behaviour seen as acceptable? I\u2019m asking not because I think it validates their behaviour (I think Jane & Joe\u2019s behaviour is creepy and disgusting) but because  I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of similar behaviour myself and my parents were always concerned about \u201chow it\u2019ll look to others\u201d so there were plenty of times they should have put their foot down and didn\u2019t because \u201cit would look bad\u201d. \n\nThe \u201cyou\u2019ll be alone forever\u201d comment really caught my attention. You\u2019re 24 ffs! What are they thinking?!?", "NTA\nFirst, you are awesome!  Who you stood up to them and their cruel comments was fantastic.  Your parents didn\u2019t do enough and if they push on this say \u201cI asked you a dozen times to be in my corner and you allowed their horrible behavior. What am I supposed to do when you clearly don\u2019t care about my feelings?\u201d\nSecond, you\u2019re still awesome.", "NTA. Your parents told you to just brush off their friends' behavior but you are held accountable when you finally dish it back?\n\nIf my friends made comments like that to my kid, I would ditch them.", "You are NTA in any way shape or form. The whole pestering you about being single is weird enough but the outright saying you\u2019ll die alone is absolutely disgusting. I don\u2019t blame you for doing what you did. Also why are these people still invited over when they can\u2019t bother to respect boundaries??", "NTA\n\nYou gave them plenty of opportunity to put a cork in it. They deserve what you delivered. Bravo.", "Nta, keep telling them that as soon as they bring that topic up", "No way! I defs wouldn\u2019t have tolerated it as long as you were able to!!", "NTA\n\n...At their grown age they were really that pressed about your relationship status?? Your parents should have immediately cut that behavior off.  It is inappropriate.  No, you're not a minor, but compared to them in their 60's they should not be that invested in your romantic life unless you invite that conversation.  Also anyone who does not respect a clear boundary is TA.  So no you're NTA, but they definitely are.", "NTA. Not harsh. Those people are trash. Ignorant close-minded narrow thinking beliefs that they're using to push arbitrary social expectations onto you. Rude and disrespectful af.", "NTA\n\nThey get to be humiliated.", "Ha, no, awesome.  You've got balls.  He bought that shit on himself.", "What you said was amazing \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\ude4c \u2764\ufe0f, fuck your parents if they can't see how insightful you are.", "NTA \n\nJane and Joe suck\n\nAlso their dumb Amatonormativity is shining through, they must be the sad ones. \n\nYour parents suck too, what you said wasn\u2019t uncalled for or disturbing, Jane and Joe are the disturbing/uncalled for ones.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add that the mentality of it being \u201ctoo late\u201d is stupid, there is no timetable or timer. \n\nIgnore people who say stupid stuff like that.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be in a relationship with anyone especially if you don\u2019t want to", "NTA honestly you handled this perfectly. Well done.", "Because they agree with the \u201cfriends\u201d and it\u2019s easier to let them be the \u201cbad guys\u201d.", "yeah the parents told her to ignore them which was a bad sign. My family used to tell me that in verbal harassment situations but it never worked. I went thru countless counselling for that, they should have taught you how to deal with it, not suppress / ignore it.", "I'm kinda like \"oh no...they were embarrassed??\" Lol.\n\nMaybe if you respect someone's boundaries and stop insisting on embarrassing *them* several times (even after you've been politely asked to stop)....that person will not be provoked into eventually embarrassing *you*?\n\nThey got exactly what they deserved. Fuck em.", "Calling out disrepectful creeps for being disrespectful creeps is never an AH move", "She did stick up for herself, many times. They ignored it and this was probably one of the only ways to get it thru their thick skulls. The better solution would've been the parents kicking them out but that seemed unlikely to happen given the repeated instances.", "NTA OP this is hilarious and incredibly witty I applaud u", "I had a creepy uncle that would mostly be creepy to my mum, she just avoided him at family events and laughed about it later. We only saw him every few years anyway. However when I hit about 15 he started giving me the creepy attention and my parents decided we weren't going to anymore family events if he was going to be there, before I had even really noticed/understood what was going on.", "Yes, I would bet lots of money they're harassing OP because they suspect she's not straight. Which says so much about life as a woman these days--of *course* you can't exist without a man, and if you think you can, then clearly you're a lesbian. /s", "I think a lot of people would be surprised at how commonplace this is. Like, *really* commonplace.", "Yes, treat them how OP was treated. \"Jane, I saw a cute boy working at the diner yesterday. You should go in and give him your number. I can gas you to him if you want.\""]}
