Recently they began to comment that I have never had a boyfriend.\n\nTo start, Jane said a local shop is hiring, and I should apply because it would be a great place to meet boys. I said thanks, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend. Joe then started saying how I should try to find someone soon before it's too late. I tried to joke it off, saying I don't need a man, and a boyfriend sounded like work. After they left, I told my parents that I didn't like those comments, and they made me uncomfortable. My parents agreed it was strange but said I shouldn't overthink it. They came over again and pushed the discussion of relationships and how I should find a boyfriend. I tried to make a joke, saying I was asked out, but turned it down. My parents seemed surprised, so I told a story about how two different guys asked me out but I turned them down because they made me uncomfortable. Jane said I should at least go on a date with them because I don't know when I'll be asked again. I became angry and told them I would rather be single than date someone who made me feel uncomfortable. Joe disagreed saying it didn't matter; I should've taken the offers. I mentioned again to my parents how uncomfortable I was with these comments, but again, I was told to ignore them. I asked my parents to tell them to stop making comments about my relationships.\n\nI saw them again last week. My parents pulled them aside and told them to stop making those comments as they made me uncomfortable; they agreed to stop. Later Joe asked me a question and when I didn\u2019t give him the response he wanted, he said he\u2019d ask about my boyfriend later to \"set me back to normal\" because it\u2019s so funny. After, Joe told everyone NOT to ask about any boyfriend because they \"wouldn't want me to get upset again.\u201d When Jane and Joe were leaving, they made a comment about me being alone for the rest of my life. \n\nThe final straw was tonight. My parents had a party, and Jane and Joe came. My parents agreed to remind them of my boundary and that I could leave if needed. The jokes continued. Jane said how sad my life must be and how I will die alone. I started to leave when Joe said Jane was right and it was almost pathetic that I didn't have a boyfriend yet. I was tired of them disrespecting my boundaries, so I turned to Joe and VERY loudly said, \"I think I finally understand why you and Jane keep bringing up my relationship status; it's because you're interested in me. That MUST be why you keep disrespecting my boundaries. Well, let me be clear, I am NOT interested in you, and frankly, it\u2019s creepy. You've known me since I was a child.\" I left after that. From what I've been told, they were embarrassed and left the party early.\n\nMy best friend thinks I am right, but my parents believe what I said was uncalled for and disturbing. What they said makes me feel disrespected, but maybe I was too harsh.

None of our friends circles ask them, figuring if they want us to know why they feel that way, or if a change in status occurs, they\u2019ll let us know. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a generational thing, I know people older than Joe & Jane who would never pry or joke about any younger person\u2019s personal life, they\u2019re just nosy busybodies.", "Nta people like this are too, they deserved it", "NTA - And OP, that was based, I have nothing but respect for what you said O7", "NTA because your dating life is none of those peoples' business and they were harping. That said, at 24 years old maybe you should not hang out with your parents and their friends as much as you seem to be. I don't mean that as a roundabout way of saying you should get out more, but I mean surely nobody is forcing you to be a part of this social scene that you find toxic, and you are certainly old enough not to have to make an appearance every time your parents have someone over to the house.", "*when are you getting married?*\n\n*When is your funeral?*", "NTA.  I'm sitting here LMAO.  This made my afternoon. Good comeback!", "I think you're hilarious. Why do they think your relationships are any of their business? Why are they so invested in your sex life?\n\nWell you shut them up. That much is guaranteed. What is uncalled for and disturbing is their constant comments and inappropriate interest. If I was your mum that is where my concern would be. That and telling my \"friends\" not to come around any more. NTA.", "GREAT JOB!!", "NTA", "NTA - that was an epic move on you part. They should be embarrassed, twice they were told politely in private they had crossed your boundary making you uncomfortable as they clearly have no social skills and they still carried on \n\nWell done OP", "NTA. Joe and Jane are classless inconsiderate rude people who definitely don\u2019t respect boundaries. Glad you blasted both AH idiots.", "I mean, you could always do what I did when faced with a slew of boyfriend questions, and just blurt out \u201cyou know I\u2019m a lesbian, right?\u201d \n\n(While I am queer, I am not actually a lesbian lol. Asexuality is too hard to explain to people when they\u2019ve already got a bee in their bonnet)", "NTA you tried it the constructive way, they wouldn't listen.\n\n*But* If you were right, then both of them would be interested in you, not just Joe. So calling them out as swingers or unicorn hunters would be more right imo \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - these people are deranged.", "Heck no, you're NTA! They had it coming. They're way too invested in your love life for it to be anything but super creepy and inappropriate. \n\nThe only thing you may have done differently is confront them yourself about your boundaries right from the start instead of outsourcing that to your parents twice. You have no idea how much they may have initially softened up or laughed off your objections to save face with their friends. And, after all, you are asserting that you are independent. \n\nI'd refuse to be in Jane's and Joe's presence ever again. They are not safe people. And maybe take a break from the 'rents for a while until they sort themselves out.\n\nGood for you turning down dates that made you feel uncomfortable for any vague reason. That's good instincts at play. Keep doing that.", "Oh HELL no. Why are they obsessing over your relationship status??? It's none of their business! Your parents should've told them that they also didn't like it, and that Jane and Joe would not be welcome if they crossed the line again. NTA", "NTA - Because this was a really strange and creepy interest in your personal life.", "NTA \n\nThat was perfect, and I would probably do something similar.\n\nWhile I was still living at home (but over 18) my parents would always open my mail even though I've asked them multiple times to stop.  (Like credit card bills, or whatever).  Finally one time there was someone over and my mom just thoughtlessly starts going through the mail and is about to open one of my letters again. So I said loudly \"are you going through my mail again even even though I asked you not to?\". She got really embarrassed, her face got red, and she never did it again.", "NTA and good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA but continue your game. Next time they come be extremely friendly with Joe. Offer him food, hold his hand, smile all the time. Tell him you don\u2019t have a boyfriend because you are more interested in older and wiser men. At the same time ignore Jane like she doesn\u2019t exist or send her dirty looks.", "NTA. You should point out to your parents you have these adults bullying you and they are worried about them feeling disrespected ? Not you? Ok", "And they told her *she* could leave rather than kicking the people making *their daughter* uncomfortable out??", "I wouldnt let this go either, one shot for everyone they threw at op. \nEvery time OP sees Joe from this point on I\u2019d ask him \u201cready to take me on a date yet?\u201d \u201cHow about that date Joe? I\u2019m waiting\u201d and if he ever made another comment to me I\u2019d say right in front of his wife \u201cwhen you gunna leave Jane and take me on that date?\u201d\nOr poke fun at their age and lack of manners \u201cI know you\u2019re from the generation that\u2019s big on manners, yours seem to be slipping.\u201d \n\u201cOh poor thing, you\u2019re getting so old you\u2019ve forgotten your manners.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m also petty, so\u2026 \nNTA", "I think that there is nuance there, though. She didn't claim he did something he didn't, she proposed a possible reason for behaviour *that everyone has seen happening*.\n\nIf she had claimed that he had actually hit on her, that would 100% be an awful thing to do, but she just highlighted how creepy his behaviour was.", "Shitty parents for sure. Care more about their friends and appearances. I wasn't interested in relationships or dating at that age either. They need to leave her be.", "I love that level of pettiness!", "\u201cOh Joe, don\u2019t give me the chocolates, l\u2019m not going in the basement with you!\u201d", "My mom's side of the family lives in small town Indiana. Every single one of them and most people in their town were married at 18 with 3 or more kids at 25. Most were divorced at least once by 30. There isn't anything to do in their town other than drink, do drugs, and have sex. They all think its normal and you are the weird one if you arent' married with kids by 25.", "A lot of older people still think \"teasing\" their kids is fine, even if the kids express boundaries. It's all in good fun, right? \n\nThen they are surprised when their kids go NC. NTA", "[deleted]", "That\u2019s really sad. My dad passed away a few weeks ago and my brother and his wife and I were all there. His brother wanted to be there too but Dad had Covid and it was just too risky.  \n\nBut then Dad was a good person and a great parent.", "I was making a joke about the average female lifespan being longer than males. \n\nMen also leave or divorce their terminally ill wives at an insanely high rate. There are so many depressing statistics around marriage that I think pressuring someone to pick a life partner in their early 20s is frankly insane.", "yeah, I can understand her not wanting to hide in her room, but why does she feel she needs to interact with them at all? If my parents are having people over, Ill generally say hello to be nice, but I'm not sticking around long enough for anyone to make weird comments about my personal life.", "Parent who secretly feel the same way, and may have expressed this to no-boundaries Joe.", "Comment partially stolen from kittievomit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ahmvk/aita_for_announcing_at_a_party_that_my_moms/jerzscr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "OOOh  yes, this exactly", "[removed]", "Comment partially stolen from kittievomit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ahmvk/aita_for_announcing_at_a_party_that_my_moms/jerzscr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3"]}
