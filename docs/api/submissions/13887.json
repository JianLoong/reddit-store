Recently they began to comment that I have never had a boyfriend.\n\nTo start, Jane said a local shop is hiring, and I should apply because it would be a great place to meet boys. I said thanks, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend. Joe then started saying how I should try to find someone soon before it's too late. I tried to joke it off, saying I don't need a man, and a boyfriend sounded like work. After they left, I told my parents that I didn't like those comments, and they made me uncomfortable. My parents agreed it was strange but said I shouldn't overthink it. They came over again and pushed the discussion of relationships and how I should find a boyfriend. I tried to make a joke, saying I was asked out, but turned it down. My parents seemed surprised, so I told a story about how two different guys asked me out but I turned them down because they made me uncomfortable. Jane said I should at least go on a date with them because I don't know when I'll be asked again. I became angry and told them I would rather be single than date someone who made me feel uncomfortable. Joe disagreed saying it didn't matter; I should've taken the offers. I mentioned again to my parents how uncomfortable I was with these comments, but again, I was told to ignore them. I asked my parents to tell them to stop making comments about my relationships.\n\nI saw them again last week. My parents pulled them aside and told them to stop making those comments as they made me uncomfortable; they agreed to stop. Later Joe asked me a question and when I didn\u2019t give him the response he wanted, he said he\u2019d ask about my boyfriend later to \"set me back to normal\" because it\u2019s so funny. After, Joe told everyone NOT to ask about any boyfriend because they \"wouldn't want me to get upset again.\u201d When Jane and Joe were leaving, they made a comment about me being alone for the rest of my life. \n\nThe final straw was tonight. My parents had a party, and Jane and Joe came. My parents agreed to remind them of my boundary and that I could leave if needed. The jokes continued. Jane said how sad my life must be and how I will die alone. I started to leave when Joe said Jane was right and it was almost pathetic that I didn't have a boyfriend yet. I was tired of them disrespecting my boundaries, so I turned to Joe and VERY loudly said, \"I think I finally understand why you and Jane keep bringing up my relationship status; it's because you're interested in me. That MUST be why you keep disrespecting my boundaries. Well, let me be clear, I am NOT interested in you, and frankly, it\u2019s creepy. You've known me since I was a child.\" I left after that. From what I've been told, they were embarrassed and left the party early.\n\nMy best friend thinks I am right, but my parents believe what I said was uncalled for and disturbing. What they said makes me feel disrespected, but maybe I was too harsh.

Bet you won\u2019t have this problem again.", "NTA if you're parents aren't going to do their job and protect you from these creepers, then you gotta take matters into your own hands.
