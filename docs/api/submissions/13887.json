Recently they began to comment that I have never had a boyfriend.\n\nTo start, Jane said a local shop is hiring, and I should apply because it would be a great place to meet boys. I said thanks, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend. Joe then started saying how I should try to find someone soon before it's too late. I tried to joke it off, saying I don't need a man, and a boyfriend sounded like work. After they left, I told my parents that I didn't like those comments, and they made me uncomfortable. My parents agreed it was strange but said I shouldn't overthink it. They came over again and pushed the discussion of relationships and how I should find a boyfriend. I tried to make a joke, saying I was asked out, but turned it down. My parents seemed surprised, so I told a story about how two different guys asked me out but I turned them down because they made me uncomfortable. Jane said I should at least go on a date with them because I don't know when I'll be asked again. I became angry and told them I would rather be single than date someone who made me feel uncomfortable. Joe disagreed saying it didn't matter; I should've taken the offers. I mentioned again to my parents how uncomfortable I was with these comments, but again, I was told to ignore them. I asked my parents to tell them to stop making comments about my relationships.\n\nI saw them again last week. My parents pulled them aside and told them to stop making those comments as they made me uncomfortable; they agreed to stop. Later Joe asked me a question and when I didn\u2019t give him the response he wanted, he said he\u2019d ask about my boyfriend later to \"set me back to normal\" because it\u2019s so funny. After, Joe told everyone NOT to ask about any boyfriend because they \"wouldn't want me to get upset again.\u201d When Jane and Joe were leaving, they made a comment about me being alone for the rest of my life. \n\nThe final straw was tonight. My parents had a party, and Jane and Joe came. My parents agreed to remind them of my boundary and that I could leave if needed. The jokes continued. Jane said how sad my life must be and how I will die alone. I started to leave when Joe said Jane was right and it was almost pathetic that I didn't have a boyfriend yet. I was tired of them disrespecting my boundaries, so I turned to Joe and VERY loudly said, \"I think I finally understand why you and Jane keep bringing up my relationship status; it's because you're interested in me. That MUST be why you keep disrespecting my boundaries. Well, let me be clear, I am NOT interested in you, and frankly, it\u2019s creepy. You've known me since I was a child.\" I left after that. From what I've been told, they were embarrassed and left the party early.\n\nMy best friend thinks I am right, but my parents believe what I said was uncalled for and disturbing. What they said makes me feel disrespected, but maybe I was too harsh.

You gave them plenty of opportunity to respect your boundaries, and your parents didn\u2019t do much to uphold them and support you.

The wife is generally quiet and nice but the husband is like the annoying 12 year old in grade school that thought being a class clown meant saying the most egregious thing they could think of. \n\nOne afternoon we were all sitting around after dinner talking and the husband tells me I look exactly like his wife when they were younger and how pretty she was. Everyone awkwardly laughed it off until he doubled down commenting to my boyfriend how lucky he is to be with such a good small good looking girl. It was awkward until the subject changed but his wife just looked sad. \n\nPeople like that are gross and after that I made the boundary with my bf that I would not attend a function where they are present because there\u2019s no changing someone who relies on vulgarity and obscenities to get a laugh.", "NTA and good for you for that clapback!

I'm close to my parents but if they have events with their close friends or work mates, I don't need to be at every one. You're doing a good job verbally reminding people of your boundaries but there comes a point where your presence in uncomfortable situations is literally up to you. You resorted to leaving in the end but it sounds like you might need to practice pre-screening situations and whether they will be of benefit to you or if you'll be disrespecting your own boundaries by attending.", "NTA.  FA&FO.  They had it coming.  Good for you! AND that's hilarious.", "NTA but they are.", "NTA. You and your parents tried to set that boundary with them, yet they still bring it up.

Your relationship status is none of their f**king business, and it is inappropriate and weird that they began taking an interest in it and then to keep going on is a form of harassment.
