He doesn't owe you or your family anything and neither do you owe him anything.

I don't think you ever need a reason to cut someone off. You're also not entitled to your uncle's money.", "NTA. I've never understood why people make such a fuss about family. Genetics doesn't make a family, actions do. Regardless of him sharing genetic material with you his actions make it clear he's not your family and standing up for yourself like that was the right thing to do. Now, if you want to be cold-hearted and calculating you could cultivate the relationship as a way to meet all his contact and just drop him once you don't need him any more but that would be getting down on his level.", "NTA.
