They wanted to make sure she was really dying. Then not another word until we held her funeral (she was cremated so we waited a month). I didn\u2019t want them notified but my sister and stepdad did.

I'll give an example from my own life, as a prior poor. \n\nJobs and job stability and growth/promotion are huge advantages for people who never had two dimes to rub together. When you find one, you do everything you can to keep it. \n\nI developed a UTI on a Saturday in a mid-sized town. I was switching jobs at the time and had no money. No cash. But I had a new job, so *eventually* cash would come and *eventually* I could pay. I couldn't go to an urgent clinic, no cash. So I had to go to the ER on an early Sunday AM because the pain was unbearable and I had work the same day (Sunday at 9 am). I couldn't go do a brand-new, customer-facing job when I had to pee every 3 seconds. I weighed my options and decided that a $4000 bill NOW was better than losing this job that could become a well-paying career in the near future. \n\nEnter the Poor Tax. Not only was I still broke, but now I had a hospital bill on top of it that was taking money I *didn't have to begin with* away every month. \n\nThis happened with my teeth three times, with my husband's back six times, with my period pain one time, and the time for the UTI. We didn't have insurance, obviously, and had never in our lives had primary doctors because poor people without insurance don't get those luxuries. \n\nFor years, we paid $600 (cumulative) extra every month because we had to use services where we could pay later for things that most people are able to deal with fairly quickly and effectively with their doctors. \n\n$600 extra dollars a month because I lived a life where health care wasn't accessible to me. I paid money because I was poor. (Edit: this continues the cycle. That $100 I *might* have had for an urgent care visit instead of the ER one month went to paying off the 5 *other* massive medical bills I had, and on and on. And on. And on.) Keep in mind, I'm also paying the poor tax on my teeth, my car, my student loans, credit cards, rent, utilities, accessible grocery stores with healthy food, poorly made cheap clothing and shoes, kitchen items, and vet bills at the same time. \n\nEvery one has medical bills; we do too, still. It's an American thing. But God damn, it hurts a lot less when you don't have regular doctor visits that *also* cost so much you have to pay it off like it's a fucking layaway service at Walmart.", "[removed]", "There was no \"good reason\" except that he disliked us because we did not have much money, and he likes to hang out with those who are rich/influential.

Like, just because your uncle is better off financially doesn't mean he's obliged to look after his brother's entire family when they fall on hard times. That would be the nice thing to do, but not volunteering doesn't make hin a scoundrel. Your dad wasn't entitled to his help. So unless he's done something to knock you when you're down or actually swindle you out of something that contributed to your family's financial difficulties, I'd say NAH.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult, you get to choose your relationships, and you choose not to have this one.\n\nYou don't owe him a thing(including respect).", "NTA, you reap what you sow.", "NTA at all! He is the AH for leaving your family in the dust, hopefully something like homelessnesses could bite him and make him realise what he did was wrong, stay strong and good luck in college!", "NTA - You're old enough to pick your friends. It sounds like this uncle is a very unkind man unless it has something for him.  Not all \"blood relatives\" are worthy of your time.", "This all sounds too Indian (sorry if it\u2019s not)\u2026.Anyways NTA! You did right, he just wants to play nice as if nothing happened and pretend to be in a good relationship to you and your family. Yes of course he\u2019s ego (as an elder) would\u2019ve been hurt But that\u2019s not your problem, you don\u2019t have to pretend everything is okay with a Fake like him. I wish I could also be this upfront with certain people But I\u2019m glad you have it in you. Your parent\u2019s reaction is (AH ofc but) understandable, and you can\u2019t change their perspective, just don\u2019t let them pursued you into apologising to him, including him in your life Or basically do anything that you don\u2019t want. And you\u2019ll be fine trust me.", "My great-grandmother was a millionaire on a teacher's salary, a long career and smart saving/investing can get you pretty far. Especially if you bought your house early enough and got it for three farthings", "What\u2019s prevented his uncle from contacting him during his entire life if he actually really does care and it\u2019s just dad being a jerk?", "Depending on the country working in customs is lucrative and considered a powerful govt position. \n\nAnd yeah...a lot of corruption.", "Or you don't have a grasp on what it means to be a customs agent in many places around the world. A lot of \"fines\" get paid on the spot.", "<<asked him for help as he's got a lot of connections, and would have been able to help us to find another house easily. >>\n\nOP doesn't say they asked to be housed by uncle but help find a new house(maybe there was a fire?  Maybe the rented house was sold out from under them--these are sad truths in life--a person can become homeless without doing anything wrong).", "Yeah... I mean this part:\n\n> he's got a lot of connections, and would have been able to help us to find another house easily. \n\nThat's simply not how it works. If the parents didn't have money for a home then they didn't have money for a home. I feel like the truth might be a little closer to \"dad wanted him to pay our rent\". Which aome people will say you should do for family, but this whole story is so sus that I really don't put much stock in what OP heard from their dad.", "The aunt and uncle have a good relationship though and both seem to dislike their brother. Not saying it\u2019s a universal and maybe both suck but I\u2019d be guessing his dad did something to make that happen", "If the dad were a jerk, then it would be the dad preventing contact? Either directly or through the uncle not wanting to cause strife between a minor and their parent. I'm not saying this definitely IS the case, maybe the dad is great and the uncle sucks. But I don't think \"he is only reaching out now\" is sus, that would fit in both cases.", "I have the same impression. I'd guess India, but I might be wrong.", "Like be poor? I mean, it's possible the father did something terrible, and it's equally possible that he didn't and they just don't like him for... any reason at all. Their reasons don't even have to make sense.\n\nHowever. It seems that OP's father did try to talk to his brother about OP and the brother was not interested. From the way it was written, it sounded like OP was present so I don't know if that counts as filtered. I bring all this up because it sounds like if OP's uncle really cared, he could have reached out prior. Doesn't seem like OP's father was interfering in their relationship, just that the uncle didn't care until he noticed his nephew may be joining his social strata. \n\nAlso, you can't really blame OP for disliking his uncle who left him homeless. The uncle may very well have had a good reason not tot let OP's parents stay with him. And he was under no legal obligation to let OP and his siblings stay. But... OP is similarly not obligated to like his uncle because of that choice. \n\nLike, if I came into some hard luck, and was no longer able to afford basic needs, and had a family. I would of course turn to family in my time of need. And I would and have been there for them in their times. If they turned their back on me, I would remember it. I'm not entitled to their help, but they're not entitled to a relationship with me.", "What dad blocked uncles number from Op\u2019a phone or something? Personally I\u2019d find it much more likely that uncle would have sought out a relationship earlier if he wanted one, rather than the sus timing here."]}
