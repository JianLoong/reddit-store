I\u2019m grateful for the feedback. I was ready to back down and just pay the invoice myself. I\u2019m going to stand by my decision. I joined Reddit after being a long time lurker, and spent time building up a bit of karma to be able to post here properly and I\u2019m so glad I did.\n\nThe garage is in a small town. There are definitely other garages around, but family have built up firm repeat business since the 1940s.  I still take my car to them, and I live 50 minutes away now. I plan in a visit at the same time. Mechanic is a long time family friend. Went to school with my parents. My Grandparents and his Grandparents are/were friends. \n\nSome of you have pointed out that it feels personal, and I believe now you may be right. I will see my family again for Easter, and when it inevitably becomes a topic of conversation again (and it will) I am going to stand by my decision and accept that half my family are just awful when it comes down to it. It\u2019s probably about time I stood up for myself anyway, might as well do it over a nice roast dinner if it comes to it.***\n\nThe story:\n\nMy parents/grandparents/aunts/uncles run a successful garage, where I get my car serviced, mended etc. I pay the full bill each time, as they have mortgages to pay. I\u2019ve never asked for a family rate and I am happy to pay. The prices are extremely fair for the quality of work I receive.\n\nLast week my car was serviced, and when I went to pick it up there was a huge oily handprint on the seat cover. The seats are light and it really stands out. The mechanic who gave me my keys back just shrugged and told me to \u201ctake it up with Daddy.\u201d My parents recommended a cleaning company, who then invoiced my parents.\n\nMy uncles are now making comments, like calling me \u201cprincess\u201d and \u201cwhat do I expect bringing cream seats into a garage\u201d. My Grandmother has also said that accidents happened and I shouldn\u2019t have expected my parents to pay the bill.\n\nAITA here? I took my car in for service, not for the seats to essentially be damaged by oil?\n\nA quick edit - my Parents have not questioned the bill in the slightest, they expected the invoice to come to them and even recommended the cleaning company. It\u2019s the rest of the family. \n\nAlso thank you so much to those of you who have come forward with advice and feedback already. I am going to take this away and use it to back my decision up. I will read and take on board every single comment. It would appear overwhelmingly that I need to grow a pair around my family and stand by my decision.", "created_utc": 1680534520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12anay4/aita_for_sending_the_cleaning_bill_for_my_car_to/", "score": 439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If covers aren\u2019t available that\u2019s a management problem, if they are and the mechanic didn\u2019t use them\u2026 that kind of corner cutting suggests he\u2019s not as great as he was.", "NTA.

If you were not family they would have paid it", "NTA! I'm surprised. I thought it was SOP to put a plastic cover over the seats to prevent this exact situation from happening. It was the fault of the garage your seat got oil on it. They need to pay to have it cleaned. FYI: Cream color seats is a VERY standard for cars. Also, the mechanic's comment \u201ctake it up with Daddy.\u201d was a completely disrespectful to you, a paying customer.\n\nEdit: If you go there again, ask that he not work on your car.

I have to wonder if this was done on purpose.\n\nLots of cars have cream colored seats.  I had a car with a cream colored interior for years, and I never had a mechanic leave a stain of any sort in my car.  I often got my car back with the interior cleaned and vacuumed from my regular garage.\n\nYour uncles and grandmother are being ridiculous.  If any other customer complained about a stain like this, the garage would pay for the cleaning no questions asked.", "NTA!

You\u2019re so right, and I\u2019m grateful I reached out to everyone.", "I still appreciate any more input. There is always fresh perspective and I really appreciate you taking the time to read.", "That\u2019s exactly what it is! The invoice went straight to the business the same day and my Mum dealt with it. Do you know how much a full car valet costs roughly in the UK? I googled it this evening after people started sharing their thoughts (because my Mum didn\u2019t share the invoice with me) and the maximum for our area, including detailing, wheels etc, for a car my size, was \u00a3160. Steam cleaning the soft top of a convertible was \u00a3145 extra. \nThe car was fully valeted when I got it back the second time, as well as the seat. The other seat had also been cleaned I assume to match the oil one. Steam cleaning two seats, maybe half the price of a soft top? For arguments sake, say \u00a370 for both as a maximum. So ball park figure, I\u2019d say it was \u00a3230 maximum. \nMy family are calling me out on a bill that didn\u2019t come directly out of their back pockets, and would have likely been heavily discounted anyway by the valet company because my parents use them weekly for my sibling\u2019s white fleet, and have done for years. It really is feeling more and more personal, the more people put their point of view across.", "Thanks for reading. Appreciate it.", "No, I really agree with this. Thanks so much for coming back to me.", "They didn\u2019t, and my Mum was so cross. She initially reacted in the way I would have expected everyone to act in this situation, that it shouldn\u2019t have happened, and she\u2019d make it right not to worry. Dad just said he\u2019d sort the cleaning. Neither of them addressed it with the mechanic though at the time, and I don\u2019t believe they will.", "Didn't realize you were a woman from the original post - has anyone suggested this could be a gender thing? I have felt dismissed so many time as a woman in car garages, technical conversations, etc. Definitely feels like a touch of good, old fashioned misogyny is at work here.", "Appreciate you taking the time to read.", "I missed this. Thanks for taking the time to read. I was fairly ok with it to start with. Inwardly cross, but I think the best of everyone and I honestly thought an accident had happened. It could have easily been a \u201cI took the seat cover off and didn\u2019t clean up as well as I should. We\u2019ll get it cleaned for you.\u201d Then I got the attitude. I\u2019m going to find another garage if I get the reaction I expect when I stand by my decision. I think it\u2019s the best thing to do.", "There is a real possibility that it\u2019s personal. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gender thing. It\u2019s not (to my knowledge) happened before, but someone else bought it up about how many other women have not come back to the garage because of the same mechanic.\nMy Mum and Aunt are heavily involved with the day-to-day running, but it doesn\u2019t rule it out of course. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been made to feel like that in the past. Thanks for taking the time to comment as well.", "It really feels now like it was done on purpose. Sorry I missed this. Thank you for taking the time to read.", "Finding a new garage is a great decision.", "NTA, of course. Glad you feel sure of your position (now). I would let your parents talk to their business partners (aunts/uncles/grandparents). They need to tell those partners that it's just not good business to not take responsibility for damage that was caused by one of their employees. It is even worse business to harangue the customer (and call them names!) for getting the corrective measures they should receive from the company. Tell your parents you appreciate them making the damage right; you should not have to put up with being harassed by the other company owners.\n\nIf the employee felt comfortable shrugging off the damage he caused, and if he felt comfortable blaming you, the customer, for wanting it corrected; then he needs a talking-to from one of the business owners. That is - again - not good for business.", "also, \"Talk to Daddy\"? \n\nmechanic sounds like he resents working on a family car. And was rude and dismissive to OP.\n\nOP, NTA.", "\u2026 unless they get business through insurance. One time insurance insisted I had to use garage x, they damaged my car while repairing it, and it took them two fucking weeks to do so. No courtesy car, of course. Insurance didn\u2019t care. \n\nCar has long since been scrapped. I\u2019m still bitter.", "I really believe it will be the best idea. Thanks so much for taking the time to read.", "Frankly, I would post the photo (I presume you have one) to a family chat, and ask if they are actually saying you are a \u201dprincess\u201c for objecting to your vehicle being treated this way. Demand an apology for how they have reacted, or tell them you would be fine posting a review with the photo online. That will shut them up.", "It never even crossed my mind about an online review! They use google reviews. Thank you for that input!", "That may very well do the opposite since they're already getting comments like \"what are you expecting with cream seats?\"\nSaying they will post a bad review will likely have the other family members telling OP off for ruining their parents business. And since the parents are ok with paying for the cleaning the issue sounds mostly resolved apart from the grumblings of the audience. Just take the car to another place when you need work done in the future", "The guys comment about taking it up with daddy really makes it seem like hes doing it to spite op also", "Lots of us who were raised to be \"nice\" have to learn, sometimes in painful or awkward circumstances, to stand up for ourselves and not let others \\[usually men, usually in male dominated \"service\" industries, in my experience\\] take advantage of us 'cause we're nice, we're *good* girls.", "I had stormtrooper (black and white) leather seats in a car that I had modified and was in several shops.  Never a single spot.", "U need to tell ur family that they need to make sure that \"Bob\" is using seat covers when he does repairs. If not he needs to be re-trained. No if's or but's excepted!", "NTA", "Deliberate or not it\u2019s not the way to do business. They should cover the cleaning cost. They made the mess. You do not assume that risk.", "I hadn't thought of that. But mechanics always seem to be the nicest guys, so I would think they take a lot of care. Now that I think about it, it does seem deliberate.", "NTA. And be sure to take it up with daddy about the rude employee's \"take it up with daddy\" comment. They should be interested in how their employees are treating their paying customers.", "I've seen would just bag the seats or some even have special plastic seat covers to throw on."]}
