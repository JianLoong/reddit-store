She has already shown you she's not interested in a relationship with you. It's been a very short period of time. It seems you are trying to force yourself into this family, when the relationship has barely taken off.\n\nThere can be a whole host of reasons why the sister doesn't like you, including she knows her brother better than you, and knows this might not be \"forever\".\n\nThat being said, you tried to compare an actual accident (she had nothing to do with the bag breaking) with an intentional disregard for others. Do you actually think these 2 situations are similar? What you told her was you think an accident is the same as intentionally wasting $5000 because of a party.\n\nSidenote: how does an adult in their 20s not know gas costs money? And $5000? You had to have left that heater on for weeks.\n\nShe seems frustrated and has told you to back off. So back off. You don't need to be friends with a teenager.\n\nMy brother used to do this, too. It seemed every girl was \"the one\". He'd beg everyone to meet her and get to know her after 2 dates. Then 2 to 3 months later, they'd break up. It's exhausting! After a few times, I wouldn't make the effort until month 4, when it seemed it *might* go somewhere.", "YTA. You sound incredibly intense and trying to force the issue here. It\u2019s been two months, you are just the girl their son/brother is currently seeing. If it\u2019s two years then it\u2019s a completely different story. You trying to bond with her using an example that doesn\u2019t quite fit the bill meant you probably came across rather patronising. She sounds like a typical 15 year old dealing with a girl who thinks she is the new love of her brother\u2019s life, have you thought about the fact that she may have gotten closer to the last one, only to lose them when her brother dumps them?", "Reading this I thought you may be 16-17yo.. \n\nESH - She could've used nicer words but she wasn't wrong. \n\n>Everyone really likes me but his younger sister (15) despises me. No matter what I try to do she is openly hostile to me.\n\nMaybe because you're doing too much. Leave her alone - you already realized that she isn't interested in getting closer to you but you don't seem to care.", "YTA, two months is nothing just because you've decided he's the one and you shouldn't be trying to get into his family like that! Also the two scenarios aren't remotely the same.", "ESH - Her response was rude but your comment may come across as thoughtless and possible patronising to her.", "ESH, but you more, I think, because it seems like this is a situation of your making. You can\u2019t force people to love you. You seem to be sure you want to be with your boyfriend forever and are trying to ingratiate yourself with his family so that you\u2019re more entangled. You don\u2019t \u2018make\u2019 yourself part of someone\u2019s family. You gradually grow to be a part of it, over time, by being consistent and learning who they are and letting them see who you are. Not shoving it down their throats. You may think everyone else loves you, but it may just be that everyone else is too polite to show you they think you\u2019re being annoying, and it\u2019s just the teenager who\u2019s rude enough to be honest. Be kind without trying so hard. \n\nAnd you think plastic bags ripping is \u2018doing something dumb\u2019? The fact that you can\u2019t see that her situation, where her tools broke unexpectedly, and your situation, where you actively racked up a bill by being thoughtless, are NOT the same - shows why she doesn\u2019t like you. If someone compared something I had no control over to something they did because they didn\u2019t think, I\u2019d probably be offended. You\u2019re calling her silly enough to rack up a massive bill just because her plastic bags ripped? That\u2019s rude. \n\nYou\u2019re A) not very smart, and B) so desperate to be liked that you\u2019re coming across quite rude. I dread to think how many other \u2018helpful\u2019 things you\u2019ve said to his family that have come across as tone deaf, and contributed to how she speaks to you.", "YTA. Sounds like the 15 year old is sick of you trying to force yourself on her. I\u2019m always dubious of people who do the \u201ceveryone loves me\u201d thing. Especially after two months. You are aware this girl doesn\u2019t care for you and continue to try and force a relationship. That\u2019s really not ok to do to an adult let alone a child.", "YTA. You are trying way too hard after only a two month relationship. If she doesn't want to connect just be polite. Pushing will not get you where you want to go.", "ESH but I'm with the teen on this one.  Was she rude? Yes.  Was she right? Yes.  \n\nDon't ingrain yourself in the life of some teen.  You are barely dating. Respect her boundaries.  There is zero reason for you 2 to bond.  If she doesn't want to that's okay.  \n\nAnd that's the dumbest comparison ever.  Berries fall on floor, no one gets mad, new berries get purchased.  \n\nYou compare it to some giant screw up.  \n\nAnd 5 grand in gas for a pool heater? You can't burn through 5 grand in gas with one night. It's not possible.", "This is hilarious, honestly. ESH because she was rude, but really, what sort of comparison was that?", "ESH.\n\nI mean she was not nice but also not wrong.\n\nThese comparisons are not the same. And how, at 21, did you not know your gas heater for your pool was going to cost money?\n\nShe sounds like she doesn\u2019t respect you. Sharing stories about yourself that reinforce that she shouldn\u2019t is not the way to go.\n\nLeave her alone.\n\nHow do you know the rest of his family likes you? Maybe they\u2019re just tolerating you. She knows her brother best. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying about you when you\u2019re not there. \n\nI would take her words of warning seriously and pump the brakes on \u201cthis is my future husband\u201d after two months of dating at age 22.", "You know she openly despises you \u2026 and you thought that story would fix it?\n\nShe didn\u2019t do anything dumb, the plastic bag ripped.\n\nThat\u2019s not dumb, it\u2019s just bad luck (or at minimum bad packaging).\n\nYou and the pool fiasco on the other hand\u2026 woof. How did you get to be 21 and not realize that heating pools costs money? \n\nComparing the two events in the same breath is wrong-headed, to say the very least of it.\n\nHer mom\u2019s the real asshole. Pick the berries up and wash them off. They grow in literal cow shit.\n\nBut I\u2019ll go with **ESH** because she sounds extra. Then again, all 15 year olds are assholes. Comes with the territory.\n\nBefore anyone asks  me\u2014 yes, I think OP sucks too. Read the room. Make apt comparisons or keep your mouth shut.", "NTA but you should not be invested so fast.  Its generally uncommon and everyone else needs time to settle into new dynamic.  Also note that while she is in this mood, whatever you tell her can come back to bite you hard.    \n\n\nOff the top of my head I cant think of a good way but I think you should make her aware that the way she behaved was very rude and just because you are the new person in her circle it does not mean it gives her the right to treat you like dirt.", "NTA she is a 15yo girl, she doesn\u2019t need to like you and you don\u2019t need her to like you. She will probably come to regret treating you this way once she has matured. I suggest you be civil to her but stop trying to win her over.", "There is a significant age difference between the two of you. She does sound difficult but perhaps you need to recalibrate. Position yourself as one of the adults rather than one of her friends. It sounds like she needs to learn better politeness and basic respect before there is any question of friendship.", "NTA. She\u2019s young, maybe jealous of losing her brother\u2019s time or attention, maybe just a rebellious little shit phase. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it much.", "NTA - You tried to connect with her and it didn't work out. She's a volatile teenager who is lashing out at you and just being shitty. Have you talked to your boyfriend about it? It's not often people find their life partners after two months.  His response will give you an idea about a few things: \n\n1. If his sister is like this often\n2. How to communicate with her better in the long term\n3. If he's ready to help you navigate difficult situations or just brushes it off.", "NAH. She\u2019s a teenager, and like most 15 year olds she is an insufferable hormonal mess who resents being forced to interact anyone who seems adult-like, which includes you. \n\nYou need to stop trying so hard. The more you try to be relatable and \u201ccool\u201d, the more she\u2019s going to roll her eyes and make snippy comments.", "Nta, but maybe you should have burst into tears. Sometimes teens need to see adults are people and they can hurt them. \n\nNot in a gross way, but there might be some jealousy,  especially if you're his first serious gf.", "NTA. I mean yeah, a bag ripping open and racking up a $5000 bill is not really the same comparison. But that in no way justifies her being overly passive aggressive towards you", "NTA \n\nI think she\u2019s right though. Once her brother gets bored of you he\u2019ll dump you and break your heart. If you think you\u2019ll be with him forever just get married asap.", "These comments are wild like you\u2019d think she was the one who call someone a stupid asshole \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "She is jealous that you are stealing her brother. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think you were trying to say what you guys did was the same. Just sharing an experience from which is totally normal. She also doesn\u2019t have to accept that or you. She\u2019s a teenager and clearly a bit rude but that\u2019s teenagers. I would be more concerned with how your bf reacts to this. He doesn\u2019t have to demand she like you, but I would be a little concerned if he just totally brushed it off. I would just not try to bond with her or even really talk her that much outside of her talking to you just to avoid any more passive remarks.
