Employers play the game of making employees responsible for covering shifts during an emergency absence. Its bad management on their part. It really has nothing to do with anything keeping the business running.", "NTA. You aren't to blame for this, the business practice of \"**short staffing**\" is.

If you weren't doing anything on vacation you could cover, but obviously you are and so you can't.\n\nDon't feel guilty.  This is on the company to figure it out.  Worse case scenario, the manager should be able to step in to fill that role if need be.", "NTA\n\nIf this is a family emergency, then your employer should have figured out a way to give your coworker the time off. Since when does 'covering colleagues emergencies' fall to other workers? \n\nThat your coworker came to you asking you to cover their shifts, suggests that your employer didnt see the emergency quite as dire as suggested, otherwise they would have found a way to cover the shifts for that employee, rather than saying 'see if your coworker will cover you'. \n\nYour vacation time (and plans) are just as important and deserved as someone elses family emergency. I get that it was an emergency, and therefore unplanned, however, why would it take precedence over your own time off?", "NTA.\n\nIt's your vacation time, earned by doing your job, and it's up to the employer to have enough cover when emergencies arise. It's unreasonable for management to expect workers having a family emergency to arrange their own cover, and ends up pitting coworkers against each other in situations like this.\n\nSure, if you were willing and able to reschedule your vacation, that would have been super considerate and caring of you. But going ahead with your pre-arranged plans isn't inconsiderate or uncaring. Your wellbeing matters too. The only AHs here are the ones trying to guilt-trip you.", "NTA\n\nYour vacation sounds like it's important to your mental health. You've already planned your time out, and losing that would likely feel pretty bad. Why is your mental health less important than their issue?\n\nCan none of your coworkers help out in the way that they seem convinced you should?\n\nUltimately, it's up to your employer to ensure adequate staffing levels or take the hit if your colleagues' problem is a genuine emergency.", "Seriously. I\u2019ve been in those colleagues shoes before.\n\nI didn\u2019t blame the person on their very deserved PTO. I stepped up and worked doubles, as did my peers, to cover all of the other peer\u2019s shifts.\n\nOP\u2019s coworkers are quick to point the blame, but they\u2019re the only ones at fault.", "Or management can utilize protocol established for any employee's emergency needs. The coworkers who chimed in are sheep. But that system is designed to force workers to blame each other instead of have reasonable expectations of management.", "Omg I had no idea it was only the two of them working! /s", "I could enjoy it very well.\n\nWhy should OP cancel their holiday? The employers should sort cover. The other employees can pick up the slack rather than bitching.", "I must have missed the part of the story where every single other employee was also working that day, and the entire business world shut down if they were missing 2 people", "No, they're not. This is managements responsibility.  Why would people be required to work doubles to cover a colleagues shift. If you're understaffed, hire more people, don't put more work on your existing employees.", "Yep", "this lmao coworker can ask someone else.", "That\u2019s a nice thought. That\u2019s how it should be.\n\nWe live in the real world where that\u2019s not the case. Work within your reality, not your ideals.", "If you allow your job to treat you like shit,  don't be suprised they treat you like shit. As an employee,  you also have a responsibility to stand up for yourself and your rights.", "While this is true, it still isn\u2019t your responsibility to make it work. We had a purchasing manager quit right when the only purchasing employee had a vacation planned. Six months in advance. They don\u2019t get to make him lose all that money in tickets because it inconveniences them. It\u2019s tough, but you deal with it. Unless you would rather lose employees long term instead of just a week."]}
