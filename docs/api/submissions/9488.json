My husband's mother baked cookies and gave us five more to take home.  My son ate 2 of the 5, leaving 3 cookies left. My husband ate a lot at my MIL's house before we left the same day.\n\nNow I've been trying to lose baby weight from our most recent baby and as such we have a rule.  No sweets in the in the house.  I have a binging problem and thus if we do want sweets we usually either make it from scratch or go out to get them when we want them and store them in designated areas in the house.  He's free to store his snacks in his office/gaming area which isn't even on the same floor.   We have multiple spots for them that aren't hard to reach, it's just not sitting out in my face all day.  I also told him earlier that I was trying not to eat many cookies that day because my progress was slowing down due to us eating out a lot.  \n\nI went out to shop for groceries bc I wanted to meal plan, and my husband left the dishes for me to do when I got back.  It was over an hour of grocery shopping and I was tired and hungry when I got back.   I started doing the dishes first and opened the cabinet that only stores our cups.  And there's two damn cookies right there in front of me.   I was mad because I had went the entire day eating only one cookie, but the reasoning for not having sweets out in the open was clear in that moment because I ate one quickly and was about to start on the other.   But I decided to just throw it away because it was the only place of finality that meant I could not get it later and devour it.   \n\n\nMy husband came up and I explained that he put the cookie in a terrible spot and I saw it and almost ate them both.  He said good thing I didn't   because he wanted the last one.  And that's when I said I threw it out.   He thinks I'm a jerk for tossing it, I think he was a jerk for putting it in the dumbest location possible, knowing I was going to do the dishes and see it.  He literally just had to walk less than 5 steps over to the snack shelf and put it there. \n\n\nTl;Dr.  I'm on a weight loss journey, we don't leave snacks out in the open bc of it (but designated areas).   My husband left cookies his mom baked in a cabinet meant for only cups although knowing I was going to do the dishes and so I tossed one of them after eating one, to prevent myself from eating the other.   \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for throwing it away?", "created_utc": 1675891178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xb4k2/aita_for_throwing_away_cookies_given_to_us_by_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand that out of sight out of mind definitely plays a big role in learning self control, then the longer you go without the more used to it you get. I have definitely thrown away junk in the past just because I knew if it was around I would want to snack on it. I don't think anyone was necessarily an AH here but both of you could do better. He could have put the cookies in a different spot and you could have brought the cookies to him when you stumbled on them, he would have taken them I'm sure.", "YTA wtf - why didn't you move it to the snack shelf for your husband?  Seriously good luck with the weight loss if you have this little self control you have to be petty and throw out a home baked cookie.  Jerk move 100%.", "YTA your poor impulse control isn't everyone else's responsibility. It's great that they are supportive and accommodating, but you need to hold yourself accountable. \n\nYou didn't eat the cookie you didn't want and then throw out the other one because of where your husband left them. It wasn't because your willpower was depleted from running an errand and doing a chore. You did it because you have a binge eating problem.\n\nYou literally had to just not touch the cookies.", "YTA. Not everything is about you. Learn some self control, don\u2019t just go throwing shit away because you\u2019re pissed.", "So because you have no self control, you threw out food you knew would be eaten? good lord, YTA", "YTA.  \"I\" have a weight issue so \"WE\" have a rule about sweets.  Sounds like a \"you\" problem that's being forced on everyone else.", "YTA. Next time try this: Put cookies in ziplock. Place cookies on husband's desk. Go about your business.", "You need therapy to work on your self control, your family shouldn't have to curb themselves because you lack it.\n\n\nYTA", "NTA. You guys had a whole system going. Now he\u2019ll know to stick to the system.", "NTA. If husband knows OP has a problem with binging (which is disordered eating behaviour) then it's also not hard for him to just move the cookie to his office/gaming area/snack shelf if he wanted the last cookie so badly. \n\nAs a person who also struggles with binging, I'd rather chuck one cookie in the bin to maintain self-control than eat it and trigger a binge. Binging is horrible and once a cycle begins it's really hard to get out of. It is literally one cookie. If you wanted a cookie so bad you'd hit the point of anger knowing someone threw it away to prevent a binge, that's makes you a bit weird in my op.", "Hmm...I can't help but feel you tossing the cookies was a retaliatory move for leaving the dishes for you. That should be a separate conversation.\n\nGood for you for being on a weight loss journey but it does not mean the world revolves around you.

Throwing away the cookie was a victory, regardless of its origin, rather than triggering a serious binge with larger consequences.

That said, do you have any ability to overcome your need to eat because of lack of control.  How long have you and your husband had the system of storing such foods in very specific places?  I get that if it is not a ED, it can be difficult to resist yummy foods and having a system and support can be a great help. O understand the desire to eat things when it goes against me losing weight.  I am weak at times and beat myself up after.  Your husband made a mistake.  I really don\u2019t know he put them the cops cabinet and not the snack shelf that was very close by. Without more information, all I say is if knows the system and supports in this weight loss journey, he shouldn\u2019t be too upset.  Yes, it was the cookie and it sadly met its fate in the trash but that\u2019s what gets for not putting them in the agreed upon spaces. He should be able to get over it.", "NTA\n\nEveryone seems to be missing the part where you seem to have an eating disorder.

Good luck on your journey!", "Hey OP? You did what you had to do to stop yourself from disordered eating and I am proud of you. You have those rules on purpose. It sucks he decided to hide the cookies where you definitely would see them.

Gee wiz.", "It sound like he agreed to store his treats/snacks somewhere else in the house.  I'm going against that grain here and say NTA.", "Esh. I get it, but it was really not ok to throw out his mom\u2019s homemade cookie. You need to find another way to deal with temptations.", "NTA, it was a cookie. He\u2019ll survive", "YTA, just leave it elsewhere out of sight. Weird weight loss rules as well.", "I just want to get this straight: he put the cookies in the cabinet where you normally store drinking cups? Do either of you keep other food there ever?", "nta especially if he - as it appears has previously agreed to the rules about sweets and where there are supposed to go - also why didn't he do the dishes?", "Yikes these comments lol NTA y'all assumedly agreed on him keeping his snacks out of sight so if he wanted to keep them he should have put them away. It's in his best interest either way, because if you have a binging problem you're just as likely to eat it as to toss it and it amounts to the same thing for him. No snacks.\n\nAlso, y'all, if it was as easy as \"have some self control\", it wouldn't be a problem to begin with.

For someone to not be helpful enough to say 'oh good for you for throwing that out instead of eating it'.\n\nBecause lets be clear. Your husband was never going to eat that cookie. That was decided when he left it for you in plain sight. Your choice was to eat it or throw it out.

Of course not.  Husband wouldn\u2019t have had the cookie, anyway.  \n\nThey have a system so that this doesn\u2019t happen.  It\u2019s a compromise.  He choose to make her life harder.  He lost out.", "All of her comments are being down voted. I think everyone has decided she's wrong no matter what it is she's saying", "Yes.  It was a shelf for cups and only cups.  The shelf for snacks was like 4 cabinets away.  5 steps.", "Hmm I'm not a child either but I've done that.\n\nWhy? Because it was their day to do the dishes. Just like on my day they leave the dishes for me. \n\nWeird relationship you have if you and you're wife only clean up after yourselves. Teamwork make the dream work", "You literally and I mean literally said on your post that you have a rule of no sweets in the house", "Jeez op, it's a cookie not crack. Do you really lack *that* much self control you can't walk away from a cookie? That's utterly ridiculous. \n\nYTA", "Funny you didn\u2019t mention that you\u2019re both trying to lose weight until the YTA comments started rolling in \ud83e\udd14. \n\nAlso, funny that you say his willpower is non existent. Dude was able to save some cookies for later while you threw them away.", "So now you are trying to control what he eats while not controlling what you eat.", "Well, now YTA, for this alone.", "He was saving it for himself though and you knew that and still ate one and threw the other away.. no where in your post does it say \u2018we\u2019re both on a diet and not eating sweets\u2019 otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have designated hiding spots for sweets.", "He set them aside for later. You couldn't do that. Sounds like you ACTUALLY thought \"if I can't have this neither can he, he's already cheated on the diet today he doesn't deserve more when I'm deprived \".", "Let's make everything someone else's fault. You need to learn that you are the only one who is responsible for your behavior.", "YTA if it wasn't as payback for him leaving the cookies in that spot, then that just means you didn't consider how your husband would feel about not being able to eat his mom's cookies. not before, during, or even now, from what i've read. it was all about you and your self control problem, which is valid but you really were an AH to your husband here.", "In the brutal dystopian wasteland of Reddit commenters, the hostile gangs are attacking me.  As of writing this, I have 5 downvotes in my previous comment.  My comment lies in the dirt, bleeding from every word\u2026 the horror", "Then NTA\n\nYour husband knew what he was doing. And you just tried to ruin your weight loss journey cuz he knows you're self-control with food is not the greatest. \n\nHe agreed to the snack cabinet and he purposely did not put it there", "NTA. If he cared so much about them he should have put them away properly", "Oh yeah, NTA", "Teamwork does make the dream work. Absolutely. But what also helps is personal accountability. Which is why after dirtying some dishes while my wife is out grocery shopping, I wash them.", "Ah true but the sentence after explains that isn't really the case.   Sorry, it was a remnant  of an edited out sentence that explains we have movie nights and it's not realistic to rebuy treats every week so we've taken to storing treats.", "It literally and I mean literally goes on to explain that there are snacks.and sweets they just have designated areas and either way you don't put cookies in the cup cupboard that's stupid", "Me offering him a cookie after he ate a bunch of cookies throughout the day when I know he is also trying to lose weight, and he had just eaten one in the hour I was gone, hence why he put them up, would be mean imo.", "They are married, the support and love each.  He screwed up and she gave into hard to control impulse so threw the other cookie out.  I am not even sure this a post that even needs to be posted.  Unless I am missing something, this seems to be a very small issue.  If there is some kind of pattern and there is resentment, then OP needs to explain the on going problem.", "Oh look you're changing the argument lol", "It was supposed to be a fun post lol.  We both apologized after and moved on. I was just curious who was more in the wrong after the fact bc I was reflecting on it.  Usually if I toss something it's my own stuff that I bought or made for me and he still gets upset at me.   But I always forget how mean people are ok here until I post, makes the backbone stronger tho.", "There\u2019s a difference between mean and honest.", "One of the things here is that you are going to find that a lot of people on this thread do not understand or believe in the existence of binge eating disorder or food addiction. This is exactly why the US is so obese."]}
