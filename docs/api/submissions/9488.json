{"id": 9488, "submission_id": "10xb4k2", "title": "AITA for throwing away cookies given to us by my MIL", "selftext": "It was technically one cookie.   Here's what happened. My husband's mother baked cookies and gave us five more to take home.  My son ate 2 of the 5, leaving 3 cookies left. My husband ate a lot at my MIL's house before we left the same day.\n\nNow I've been trying to lose baby weight from our most recent baby and as such we have a rule.  No sweets in the in the house.  I have a binging problem and thus if we do want sweets we usually either make it from scratch or go out to get them when we want them and store them in designated areas in the house.  He's free to store his snacks in his office/gaming area which isn't even on the same floor.   We have multiple spots for them that aren't hard to reach, it's just not sitting out in my face all day.  I also told him earlier that I was trying not to eat many cookies that day because my progress was slowing down due to us eating out a lot.  \n\nI went out to shop for groceries bc I wanted to meal plan, and my husband left the dishes for me to do when I got back.  It was over an hour of grocery shopping and I was tired and hungry when I got back.   I started doing the dishes first and opened the cabinet that only stores our cups.  And there's two damn cookies right there in front of me.   I was mad because I had went the entire day eating only one cookie, but the reasoning for not having sweets out in the open was clear in that moment because I ate one quickly and was about to start on the other.   But I decided to just throw it away because it was the only place of finality that meant I could not get it later and devour it.   \n\n\nMy husband came up and I explained that he put the cookie in a terrible spot and I saw it and almost ate them both.  He said good thing I didn't   because he wanted the last one.  And that's when I said I threw it out.   He thinks I'm a jerk for tossing it, I think he was a jerk for putting it in the dumbest location possible, knowing I was going to do the dishes and see it.  He literally just had to walk less than 5 steps over to the snack shelf and put it there. \n\n\nTl;Dr.  I'm on a weight loss journey, we don't leave snacks out in the open bc of it (but designated areas).   My husband left cookies his mom baked in a cabinet meant for only cups although knowing I was going to do the dishes and so I tossed one of them after eating one, to prevent myself from eating the other.   \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for throwing it away?\n\n\nEdit;. Alright.  Time to move on from reading comments.  To those who voted me as the asshole. I get it. It's food waste.  To the ones calling me an asshole for making my family suffer - fully read my post, our house has lots of sweets and snacks.  In fact I realized we still have chocolate chip cookies frozen in our freezer.  No one is suffering in an inability to indulge themselves when they want to.  To those who said NTA, thanks.  I think everyone deals with food in their own ways. Mine was cemented in my head to be unhealthy at a young age so here I am.  Unable to control myself at times.

I understand that out of sight out of mind definitely plays a big role in learning self control, then the longer you go without the more used to it you get. I have definitely thrown away junk in the past just because I knew if it was around I would want to snack on it. I don't think anyone was necessarily an AH here but both of you could do better. He could have put the cookies in a different spot and you could have brought the cookies to him when you stumbled on them, he would have taken them I'm sure.", "YTA wtf - why didn't you move it to the snack shelf for your husband?  Seriously good luck with the weight loss if you have this little self control you have to be petty and throw out a home baked cookie.  Jerk move 100%.", "YTA your poor impulse control isn't everyone else's responsibility. It's great that they are supportive and accommodating, but you need to hold yourself accountable. \n\nYou didn't eat the cookie you didn't want and then throw out the other one because of where your husband left them. It wasn't because your willpower was depleted from running an errand and doing a chore. You did it because you have a binge eating problem.\n\nYou literally had to just not touch the cookies.", "YTA. Not everything is about you. Learn some self control, don\u2019t just go throwing shit away because you\u2019re pissed.", "So because you have no self control, you threw out food you knew would be eaten? good lord, YTA", "YTA.  \"I\" have a weight issue so \"WE\" have a rule about sweets.

You guys had a whole system going. Now he\u2019ll know to stick to the system.", "NTA. If husband knows OP has a problem with binging (which is disordered eating behaviour) then it's also not hard for him to just move the cookie to his office/gaming area/snack shelf if he wanted the last cookie so badly. \n\nAs a person who also struggles with binging, I'd rather chuck one cookie in the bin to maintain self-control than eat it and trigger a binge. Binging is horrible and once a cycle begins it's really hard to get out of. It is literally one cookie. If you wanted a cookie so bad you'd hit the point of anger knowing someone threw it away to prevent a binge, that's makes you a bit weird in my op.", "Hmm...I can't help but feel you tossing the cookies was a retaliatory move for leaving the dishes for you. That should be a separate conversation.\n\nGood for you for being on a weight loss journey but it does not mean the world revolves around you.

You need to learn restraint; not the people around you.", " \nNTA. To everyone saying \u201cYTA cause you have poor self control\u201d that\u2019s not the issue in question here.

Throwing away the cookie was a victory, regardless of its origin, rather than triggering a serious binge with larger consequences.

That said, do you have any ability to overcome your need to eat because of lack of control.  How long have you and your husband had the system of storing such foods in very specific places?  I get that if it is not a ED, it can be difficult to resist yummy foods and having a system and support can be a great help. O understand the desire to eat things when it goes against me losing weight.  I am weak at times and beat myself up after.  Your husband made a mistake.  I really don\u2019t know he put them the cops cabinet and not the snack shelf that was very close by. Without more information, all I say is if knows the system and supports in this weight loss journey, he shouldn\u2019t be too upset.  Yes, it was the cookie and it sadly met its fate in the trash but that\u2019s what gets for not putting them in the agreed upon spaces. He should be able to get over it.", "NTA\n\nEveryone seems to be missing the part where you seem to have an eating disorder. (They aren\u2019t just anorexia and bulimia people.)\n\nThis is a family rule. He agreed to the rule, whether Reddit likes it or not. He was probably lazy, but the natural consequence to the food not being put away properly is that the food is gone.\n\nI would encourage you to seek therapy though. Good luck on your journey!", "Hey OP? You did what you had to do to stop yourself from disordered eating and I am proud of you. You have those rules on purpose. It sucks he decided to hide the cookies where you definitely would see them.

You explained that there are designated places around the house to store food and your husband put them in the fucking dish cupboard? What the fuck?

Idk I think there must be something I'm missing here due to all these damn Y T A judgements.", "YTA for making me think this was a math problem.  Disappointed.", "NTA. You had an agreement that he would put his snacks away and instead he shoved them wherever. You supplied natural consequences.", "YTA. Your total lack of any kind of self control isn't his problem. He's already going along with your other demands. You're an adult, act like one. You could have handled this in any number of ways other than throwing homemade baked goods away because you have the impulse control of a two year old.", "NTA.

Gee wiz.", "It sound like he agreed to store his treats/snacks somewhere else in the house.  I'm going against that grain here and say NTA.", "Esh. I get it, but it was really not ok to throw out his mom\u2019s homemade cookie. You need to find another way to deal with temptations.", "NTA, it was a cookie. He\u2019ll survive", "YTA, just leave it elsewhere out of sight. Weird weight loss rules as well.", "I just want to get this straight: he put the cookies in the cabinet where you normally store drinking cups? Do either of you keep other food there ever?", "nta especially if he - as it appears has previously agreed to the rules about sweets and where there are supposed to go - also why didn't he do the dishes?", "Yikes these comments lol NTA y'all assumedly agreed on him keeping his snacks out of sight so if he wanted to keep them he should have put them away. It's in his best interest either way, because if you have a binging problem you're just as likely to eat it as to toss it and it amounts to the same thing for him. No snacks.\n\nAlso, y'all, if it was as easy as \"have some self control\", it wouldn't be a problem to begin with.

I've had long periods of time where I just don't have any sweets around me, and it's helped me control my weight.\n\nBut with kids, you end up with all kinds of snacks and treats and shit that i'd otherwise never have around. For someone to not be helpful enough to say 'oh good for you for throwing that out instead of eating it'.\n\nBecause lets be clear. Your husband was never going to eat that cookie. That was decided when he left it for you in plain sight. Your choice was to eat it or throw it out.

You will never succeed at this journey without tackling the root cause and the habits you formed to deal with that cause. The cookies weren't even out. You came across them. You already had your share, so yeah, YTA, for deciding no one else got MILs cookie because of your journey.

Weight loss is hard enough, having people around you make it harder is awful. Especially people who are supposed to care about you and want you to succeed.

You can't completely cut it out of your life. You're always around it & faced with it. Anorexia & bulimia are not the only eating disorders. Compulsive overeating is also an eating disorder.

I gotta agree with others, as someone with impulse control issues, I live alone and manage them by simply not buying this I'll binge. That includes snacks, alcohol, tobacco products.

Binge eating is a problem, but instilling these kind of unconscious lessons could easily cause it\u2019s own food related traumas in the children.

I did. And that\u2019s for my brother who isn\u2019t even worried about his habits. \n\nYou are barely asking for anything. You still keep snacks in the house. You still brought the cookies home for others to eat.

It\u2019s always when you\u2019re stressed or tired and you don\u2019t have he energy to argue against yourself that you slip.

I now have a normal relationship with food because through therapy I learned other ways to feel my feelings and process them and cope with them. Perhaps you just need to learn new ways to cope with stress or tiredness, etc. and to reset your view of food from \u2018relief\u2019 to \u2018energy for survival.\u2019 I would encourage you to talk to a professional if you\u2019re open to that.
