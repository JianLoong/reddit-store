The older they get, the more privacy they need and, unless they prove otherwise, deserve... but good Lord, if they had half the notion of what our generation's parents put us through, and likely what their parents put them through, and so on through the ages... parents will, when necessary, breach boundaries, disregard privacy, and, inevitably, embarrass their kids.
