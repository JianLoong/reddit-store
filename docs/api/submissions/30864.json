This has caused countless issues in almost all my relationships, however, let me tell you what I have told others a million times: her desire to be on her own for a few days has absolutely nothing to do with you and it also has nothing to do with her not being \u201call in\u201d. \n\nSecondly: not everyone cares about birthdays. Not everyone thinks they\u2019re a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d. Again, this has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s not about you. I have not celebrated my birthday in decades, even as a kid I barely cared. I always go somewhere - on my own - because that is what I prefer. This is her birthday, not yours - and she wants to treat herself to a few days on her own.\n\nSo to sum up: none of this is about you, your relationship, or her commitment to it and to you, YOU think her wanting a few days on her own means she\u2019s not all in. That is not HER definition. YOU think birthdays are special and must be spent together, SHE doesn\u2019t think so. \n\nThis is where communication comes in. Share how you feel. Not by saying \u201cthis is lame\u201d, which is derogatory - say that it makes you feel insecure, because obviously that\u2019s what's going on. That way, she can assure you of what I just outlined above. But don\u2019t pressure or blackmail her in any way to change her mind.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m seeing a lot of comments of people taking her side and blah blah. If it was reversed and a woman said\u2026hey I\u2019m upset my boyfriend wants to go to a different country on his birthday and didn\u2019t include me in the plans or ask\u2026I bet you these same people would say, yea we get why you\u2019re upset.\n\nForget the assumption of babysitting for the moment, can anyone honestly say that they are in a committed long term relationship and don\u2019t bother to ask the SO to come on vacation with them for their bday to relax? \n\nDon\u2019t care the sex, if you don\u2019t include your SO in big plans, even if it\u2019s just an invite that\u2019s asshole behavior.

Its so sad to hear that she needs \u2018her birthday\u2019 to get what she needs while at the same time you feel rejected thinking that she wants nothing to do with you. Again, Its not about you, don\u2019t get hurt for this.\n\nIf this sounds too heavy on you, with kids in the picture, I suggest to rethink your long term commitment, because it might go downhill anyway.\n\nSo..NAH\nJust a couple struggling to understand each other needs.

I'm with you that it stings to be assumed as someone to be taken for granted for that.\n\nHowever, wanting to give herself a birthday present, a trip alone, sounds completely rational to me. She's not having this desire *at* you. It's not a rejection. It's what she wants for her birthday!", "Her wanting a solo vacation doesn't mean she doesn't love you, keep in mind. Some people do need solo vacations and if you have kids likely she *really* just wants a vacation from them, and you're the easiest/most trustworthy sitter.\n\nI wouldn't take it personally unless she always goes alone and never wants you to come.

Plenty of other ways to relax by yourself.", "i think its the on call stripper to square meter ratio", "And its entire tourism brand is \"sin.\" PR doesn't actively market itself as a place to go and do stuff you don't want other people to know about.\n\nLook, I love Vegas, but the hypothetical switch from \"beach destination\" to \"Sin City\" was an obvious rhetorical trick.", "This is what I am thinking is going on.  The woman just wants a nice weekend alone so she doesn't have to entertain or worry about anyone but herself. Op sounds like a needy child.", "Its not about what he wants all the time. It's about what they, as a team, want all the time. If she respects him, she'd have that discussion before planning the trip. I'd feel the same way if the roles were reversed.", "Yeah okay, that does seem very presumptuous on her part...", "She's going to cheat. This isn't hard. At minimum she wants to do things she doesn't want you to see, tale as old as time. If you were married I guarantee she'd take her ring off the second she got on the plane.\n\nShe's going to Puerto Rico cheat.", "Absolutely, she would assume something psychologically had broken inside of me. Been married almost 20 years now, she\u2019d probably assume a psychological break or an affair I\u2019d guess. \n\nTo just start ditching her after all this time together, something would have to be horribly wrong. \n\nHow do you love someone and also not want them to be around you? That\u2019s fucked up.", "You go to Vegas for ten days and you can see Carrot Top nine times. No other reason needed.", "They have some nice pools", "I go to Vegas for the arcades. Vegas isn't all hookers and blow. You either trust your partner or you don't, and OP didn't seem to be suggesting he didn't trust his partner.\n\n\nHe felt hurt that she doesn't want him with her on her special day. That's literally it. So keep the discussion on that.", "REALLY suspicious \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d out of all the beautiful places\u2026vegas", "Yet a solo trip to PR when you\u2019ve known each other less than a year and you have to watch her kids is not suspicious? Actually I bet that if he was going to PR alone most people here would claim it suspicious. There\u2019s always a double standard. \nBut to be honest, I wouldn\u2019t leave my kids with someone I\u2019ve known for a few months anyways. That bothers me.", "I was in the Dominican for my honeymoon, even with my wife there women were trying to hit on me. Sorry but this is a red flag for me, especially because she just assumed he would be okay with it and would watch her kids.", "i agreed with what you said first, but lost me when you somehow think a trip to Vegas is suspicious, but not to puerto rico lol", "Genuinely why are people so butthurt at the concept of partners letting each other have 3 day solo trips. Are you really telling me that if your partner said 'hey, I'll look after the kids, now go and enjoy 3 days of relaxation and freedom to enjoy whatever food and tourism you want. March to your own drum for 72hrs!', you wouldn't be happy? Unless you really don't like being alone that is. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you just give up the part of yourself that likes to be alone once in a while. Plus, if you can't trust your partner not to cheat for 3 days why be with them at all? \n\nWhy is it so awful, as long as OP would have the same opportunity?", "have you not been to puerto rico?", "Lol\u2026yeah, I guess. \nBut honestly, if he was the one asking for babysitter services while going away alone on his birthday to P.R.,  when they\u2019ve only known each other a few months, everyone here would have a different response. \nNot to mention that you\u2019re leaving your teenage kids with someone you probably don\u2019t fully know. That irresponsible.", "Keep it as PR. The male you\u2019ve known for a year wants to go to Puerto Rico for his birthday to celebrate without you but wants you to babysit his kids. No, not a red flag at all. \ud83d\ude44", "Right. The guy who watched her kids for 10 days while she was gone not too long ago. You ppl are hilarious. His feeling is a normal reaction. Stop shaming men for having feelings. It\u2019s gross. Strange how similar posts with reverse genders get the opposite reaction. Hmmmm", "If the situation was reversed this would've been the majority of the posts.", "Oh that's definitely cause for concern NGL", "Yep it's almost u/icy-internal8263  was making a completely false comparison to prove a bad point", "i immediately thought that. people can say they wouldnt to prove their point but if the roles were reversed this comments section would look very different.", "Why? Vegas literally markets itself as a place for \"sin,\" always has. Gambling, prostitution, strip clubs, wild parties.... it's a more suspicious destination because its entire tourism brand is being bad.   \n\n\nPR's tourism brand is beach.", "Did you miss the part where she made these plans and decided to dump the kids on him regardless of how he feels? You\u2019re going on and on about a completely different issue that isn\u2019t present here.", "Grow up, OP did not insist that to her. She told him that\u2019s what she\u2019ll be doing for her bday without communication it to OP. Let\u2019s get real, they are both 40 year old adults, divorced, and with kids. If anything; I\u2019m sure OP would\u2019ve been happen to offer her something similar closer to where they live. I\u2019m not saying she can never ask for that in this relationship, but I\u2019m saying she\u2019s outta pocket for demanding that now. But if it was OP demanding a trip like that, I guarantee you would be saying the same things I\u2019m saying.", "I hate to play to gender stereotypes but I feel like in this situation it is relevant. A woman wanting a solo trip to a beach destination for her birthday is not a red flag. Hypothetically a male wanting a solo trip to a beach destination could be perceived by some to be a red flag because generally *generally* emphasis generally, men\u2019s preference isn\u2019t a relaxing solo beach trip so people\u2019s minds go to, he\u2019s cheating. \n\nIf you replaced it with something men more stereotypically do solo, such as a camping trip, suddenly the red flag disappears. If OP wanted to go on a weeklong solo camping trip would you consider that a red flag too? \n\nI hate myself for saying this, I don\u2019t subscribe to gender stereotypes I\u2019m just trying to show this from a different perspective. \n\nPersonally I can see why she\u2019d want a solo break, she\u2019s a single mom to teenagers with the father not around so probably hasn\u2019t had the opportunity for a break in quite some time. Now she\u2019s with a guy who she\u2019s comfortable with around her (almost adult) children who she thinks is happy to look after them and she\u2019s jumping at the opportunity. I think it\u2019s ok that she wants this and I also think that OP doesn\u2019t have an issue with looking after the kids, he\u2019s upset because she wants a solo trip and he\u2019s offended by that. It\u2019s not about him.", "That\u2019s for you dummy, some people can recharge on their own alone time. You assuming the worst is pretty pathetic, get your panties out of your ass and let her enjoy her own company.", "I am not shaming or blaming him. But I will not blame her either.  \nI think they have different expectations about the relationship dynamics and if they didn't talk it through, they will just resent each other.", "I got drug to a Carrot Top show and he was actually hilarious and dark. He\u2019s the longest running comedic act in Vegas. (And I think all time out of every comic who had a residency)", ">PR's tourism brand is beach.\n\nThat may be their \"brand\" but if you've ever been there, you'd know that PR has the exact same stuff (except legalized prostitution, but dancing at a San Juan club is just barely removed from public sex).", ">PR's tourism brand is beach.\n\ni understand your ignorance if you've never been to latin america, but puerto rico isn't missing any of the prostitution, strip clubs, or wild parties. it just also happens that these activities are at beach", "i mean, good job at doing exactly what you hate. unless you just subscribe to gender stereotypes there isn't a logical reason as to why a man shouldn't be able to enjoy a peaceful vacation on the beach. not everyone with a penis is a sex freak", "Yeah, even though I guess it's understood that more men than women do cheat, that doesn't mean that there aren't a lot of women who cheat. I don't get the double-standard right off the bat, giving a woman the benefit of the doubt while immediately saying the guy must be up to something.", "I'm guessing you've been divorced. If not, it's in your future.", "I\u2019m not blaming anybody but plenty of ppl here are blaming him. \u201cNeedy child\u201d. Lol. This is an atypical request from her. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar. She has the right to do what she wants. He has the right to feel bad about it. He also has the right to reconsider this relationship. If this was reversed this whole sub would be telling the woman to dump him. If you don\u2019t believe that, a similar post to this was posted previously (reversed) and got the exact opposite reaction. Reddit is toxic to men"]}
