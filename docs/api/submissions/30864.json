Didn't tell her she was an ah for going without him.... Didn't say he wouldn't watch her kids for her.... Just said \"I wish I was going with you.\"", "I've done that myself, but never for a birthday while in a relationship. Nope. Always wanted to spend those with my SO. We always took a trip. A few weeks after she gets back from her trip to PR, she's going to announce she's pregnant.", "Oh please. He told her it was lame and made her responsible for his feelings. \u201cI\u2019m more committed because I don\u2019t want to go on vacation without her\u201d is manipulative and BS.", "He can be an asshole for HOW he expressed his feelings. Calling it lame and insinuating that because she wants a solo trip she must not be committed to the relationship is what made him an asshole."]}
