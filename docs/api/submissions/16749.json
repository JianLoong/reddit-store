As it was only in 2019 that there were even laws enacted to protect Black people from discrimination for simply wearing their hair in traditional protective styles, or even as it just naturally grew from their heads. \n\nI would also suggest you look up the literal laws that were in place that allowed the legal persecution, and imprisonment of Black people for wearing those hairstyles.\n\nThat is why those styles of braids are culturally specific.", "Discussion seems to be around box braids.

Phom Pia is very similar in Thai culture, as well (though typically was among men historically). \n\nIn the US, it is primarily associated with Black cultures, but as more cultures become visible and present in the US, it is important to remember that similar hairstyles have existed in different parts of the world for some simple reasons: braids in particular help keep hair looking neat. Tibetan culture in particular has a problem in the US because their braids are very similar and hold high spiritual significance \n\nA white person in the US is likely appropriating. However, you still should not make the assumption the person is white and not mixed race. No one needs someone else policing their heritage because their genetics are a bit different. Mixed race people in the US often get a raw deal from multiple sides. And you should be aware that other cultures have held similar practices that aren't necessarily considered as much in the US, so there are non Black persons not appropriating", "This very topic was debated on this very sub only a couple of weeks ago and it appears that braiding of hair is not that cultural specific at all.\n\nBraiding it has been practiced by many different cultures from all over the world and even box braids are **not** exclusive to African-Americans or Africans.  Box braids too have been a hair style for many different cultures throughout time and place", "Yeah, that's literally exactly what you said. \n\nYou made a claim (a completely unverifiable one at that) that a Black person that you *claim* to know, disagrees that white people shouldn't have box braids.

I know that someone who sees me would not have the necessary context to know that I'm actually from that culture, and oftentimes I've had people who've assumed I was white bake the assumption that it's okay to commit cultural appropriation against other cultures, because by honouring my own heritage, I appear to be doing it myself. \n\nI will also point out that the cultures you mention have micro braids. They are not rows, or box braids, and are done differently, and are not worn tight to the scalp. Which would in fact damage their hair if they were.", "I agree with you on this! However, regardless, I do believe box braids should be more specific to some, not all. This is because of the damage it can cause to hair types that it\u2019s not built for (pretty much anything under 3c). It\u2019ll cause more damage than protection. Otherwise, so long as you\u2019re not doing anything rude with it, I personally consider it cultural (whether specific to African culture or not) appreciation, not appropriation. Personally 99% of the people I see who are pressed about white people wearing traditionally African hairstyles tend to be\u2026white people. Funky how that works, I\u2019ve personally never met anyone else who\u2019s upset about it.

Every verifiable source of information on the anthropology of human hairstyles has conclusively shown that these styles are in fact exclusive to regions where Black people originate from. \n\nOther cultures throughout the years have appropriated several of them, and created variations on them. Particularly during the trans Atlantic slave trade. However box braids, and locs are in fact exclusive in origin to Black cultures. \n\nAlso don't even try to come at me with any nonsense about Celts, and Norse having locs or box braids either. As that theory has been thoroughly, and conclusively disproven by historians, and anthropologists alike. They wore loose braids, and knots in their hair, but not at any point in their history did they ever wear box braids or locs. \n\nNone of that is even to mention that if a person who does not have Black textured hair were to wear their hair in either of those styles for any amount of time, it will actually seriously damage their hair.", "So your stance is ... the Jamaican woman who's made a career of braiding tourists hair ... might not think white girls should have braids?
