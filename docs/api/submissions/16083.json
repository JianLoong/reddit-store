Imagine being stuck with this asshole for the rest of your life.", "Omg that is the once in a lifetime thing?!!!", "May I suggest stopping that? I have friends who went through this. Eventually it came to light that the guy was spending a ton of money on a camgirl. Their 7 year marriage almost ended immediately. It\u2019s been months of couple\u2019s counselling but they still aren\u2019t in a great place. If anything, they\u2019re getting worse because they\u2019re self-medicating to avoid really dealing with their marriage. Everything comes out eventually. Don\u2019t hurt your future bride.", "Question, how old are you??", "So you want a brood mare and a mommy. Then you can pay $ to perv out and disrespect her. Grow up.", "You\u2019re not going to have that if you\u2019re focused on meeting OnlyFans models, dude. You just aren\u2019t. \n\nI sincerely hope that one of your groomsmen will man up and tell your fianc\u00e9, so she doesn\u2019t waste any more of her time.", "It\u2019s because you\u2019re one dimensional lol!", "Not anymore thankfully, they were awful", "Why are you marrying her?", "No denying that lol \n\nI just picture their bachelor parties in paneled studies with brandy and cigars", "100% didn\u2019t look forward to all outs with Aoki", "Julia Giulia all over again.", "Same.

Smile for the camera. Okay, thanks for coming out.\" Because that's what a meet and greet is.", "So sad", "[Yes.](https://youtu.be/ZEsd1m2wmo0)", "Nah doubt it. This guy is way too fucked up to do anything moral on his own", "Wow. That's..... dumb.  But I guess people are into it.  Ok.", "Yeah, but one can hope. He does lack functioning judgment, so maybe it could work, lmao", "Do you wanna be this kind of person or would you rather be the kind of person your fiancee would want to keep around. You need to figure out what commitment means to you, because you're not going into this relationship with a monogamous mind. Figure this shit out before you get married.", "And also what industry he works in.", "Drugs will do weird things man", "There is a very big difference between \"snitching\" and pumping the fucking breaks on a train wreck before it happens.  \n\n\nSOMEONES got to be an adult here and stop this nonsense."]}
