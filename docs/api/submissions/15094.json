On days where she commutes in the morning, I wake up early with her, make us French press coffee while she gets ready, and I walk her to the ferry which is approximately a 5 minute walk, and then approximately a 5-10 minute wait for the ferry onboarding. \n\nOn our walks, she insists that I carry her purse, saying that her bag is heavy, that she has to carry it all day, and that if I carry it on the walk it would mean a lot to her. \n\nI told her that she\u2019s putting me in an awkward situation, where I need to either a) carry her purse which I would prefer not to do or b) have an argument first thing in the morning because I refused to carry her purse. \n\nMaybe I am just stubborn, but to me, carrying my wife\u2019s purse, and then standing in line with all of the commuters waiting to board the ferry as I hold my wife\u2019s purse for her commute into work, is a bit emasculating and humiliating. \n\nShe on the other hand thinks that it would be a nice gesture, and the fact that it I find it embarrassing for me is irritating because I should a) care more about what she thinks than what other people think and b) be comfortable enough in my own skin not to feel emasculated or humiliated. \n\nSo what do you think?

While you are in the right for not doing what you don't want to do, I only listed you as an AH because with your reasoning it feels like ego is getting in the way of 5 minutes that could potentially mean a lot to her. That being said, I don't know your situation, it's sweet you take the time out of your day to walk with her.  \n\nThat being said, if it is actually too heavy, it's on her. If it's an awkward way of her saying that it would mean a lot to her, it's worth weighing if her brief happiness outweighs your brief discomfort.

It\u2019s common decency to carry your own stuff .You can offer it on days when she is feeling low or something but that\u2019s about it . You will always offer her help if she is struggling to carry it n all but if she can carry it around the entire day then she can do it during the walk also.\n\n\nOn the other hand calling it humiliating is a bit fragile , if ure uncomfortable it\u2019s understandable but having such an extreme view is a lil too much", "Both of you are utterly ridiculous. Buy her a backpack and stop being so easily emasculated. \ud83d\ude44", "ESH. \n\nFirst, she needs to downsize her purse. If it\u2019s that heavy, she is asking for future back problems. I started caring a small clutch years ago and my back is grateful. \n\nSecond, grow tf up. It\u2019s only emasculating to carry her purse because you have some ridiculous notion of masculinity.

I fight him on carrying it for me because I don't want to spend the entire walk being reprimanded for how I'm hurting my back walking around like this. So if we need a verdict, I'd say ESH--it's weird of her to insist, it's lame that you're so insecure in your masculinity that you can't carry a purse for 10 minutes a few times a week. But a solution that worked for us may work for you! Have her split the daily load into two bags--one with her personal \"purse\" stuff and one with presumably her work stuff that's making the bag so heavy. It's genuinely better for her back to split the load over two shoulders when you're not there, and when you are, she can carry her personal stuff and you can carry the laptop bag so your penis doesn't shrink on the way to the ferry.", "you\u2019re both so pathetic. i wish i had these kinds of problems.", "NTA I'm female and I hate heavy purses. She needs to down-size or something if it's too heavy. It's not good for her.  I'll get downvoted to hell, I bet, but I don't expect men to carry purses. I don't even carry one myself at times.", "NTA", "It's really weird that she's obsessing over forcing you to do something that makes you uncomfortable.  Why do you walk her to the ferry every morning?  If her purse is so heavy she can't carry it she needs to remove the extraneous garbage from her purse.  FYI my husband is always willing to hold my purse in a public place while I use the rest room--- but I'd never dream of asking him just to carry it so I don't have too (LOL that is so lazy) or if he said it made him uncomfortable. \n\nNTA but there's definitely something going on with your wife to come up with such a weird flex.", "ESH for the emasculating line but I would say she is the main AH for having a bag that is too big and expecting you to carry it", "ESH.  You for being concerned about how carrying a purse looks and for not offering to do it from the git go.  Her for expecting you to carry her purse.  \n\n\nSeriously, you are over 30 and you are still concerned that helping carry things for your wife is going to make you less manly to people that you don't know and will never interact with.  That really seems like it made sense to you?", "ESH. You need to get over your petty insecurity about holding a woman's bag. Finding it embarrassing is absurd. Especially because it seems like a manly gesture to help a woman carry something.\n\nThat being said, asking someone to carry your bag for you should be reserved for occasions when it's necessary like she's extra tired, the bag is extra heavy, she has to use the bathroom, etc. Expecting you to do it every day is unreasonable. If her bag is that heavy she needs to find a way to carry less stuff or switch to a backpack or something. Unless her job requires her to carry heavy stuff beyond her control, she needs to better manage her stuff and not expect another person to do this for her every day.", "ESH \n\nShould she carry her own purse? Yeah. \n\nWould it be a kind gesture to carry it for her sometimes? Yeah. \n\nAre you allowed to be bothered by a request that makes you feel \u201cemasculated\u201d? Yeah. \n\nBottom line: draw a boundary and stick to it. If you feel like your manhood is threatened by a black purse, don\u2019t hold it.

It\u2019s normal to help people if they need it, even if it doesn\u2019t match our own esthetic and there are plenty of countries where men carry bags that men deem \u201cpurses.\u201d The idea of not being able to carry a woman\u2019s purse b/c it\u2019s \u201cemasculating\u201d is absolutely something I see more in the US than other countries I\u2019ve lived in/been to.", "NTA, if you don\u2019t want to carry it just don\u2019t. \nIf your wife continues to insist don\u2019t walk her to the ferry anymore, problem solved.", "YTA for being so fragile about a purse. Anyone seeing you two would know it was hers.\n\nA purse is usually worn over one shoulder. If your wife is wearing professional shoes\u2014heels or even office flats\u2014I bet her back hurts like a bitch.\n\nThat said. The solution is talk and honesty. Because sometimes, you can be irrational and that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s important to realize the locus of this problem is your internalized issues, and take ownership of that.

And most women do enjoy a thorough purse-shopping.", "NTA she should change something so she can do it by herself all day?", "NTA. Your wife doesn\u2019t know when to stop pushing her luck!

It really irritated me and I told her I wouldn\u2019t do that again.\n\nIf you are not comfortable, that is 100% ok. To everyone dissing OP for not being comfortable, why does he not have the right to have a feeling about something like this? The wife is being ridiculous in this scenario. My dad doesn\u2019t like carrying my mom\u2019s purse either. Just because YOU don\u2019t mind does not mean others won\u2019t.\n\nIf she really wants you to carry her purse, maybe put her stuff in a messenger bag or laptop bag.", "I'm going to go out on a limb and guess this isn't about the purse. I mean, it probably is heavy bc I'm assuming she's using it like a briefcase and carrying her laptop, ect in it, so it would be a kind gesture from you. But, I'm willing to bet that for whatever reason, her spouse helping with this is deeply meaningful to her. Maybe her dad carried her mom's purse and she sees that act as deeply loving. I don't know. But your refusing to do it with such distain, she's hearing \"I don't love you that way,\" which she's then going into a mini crisis wanting to repair, which means getting you to carry the purse. I don't know why this specific thing is important to her, but it is. And I don't know why she needs it. \n\nMy BFF had a longtime boyfriend who would wake up and make her coffee and stuff, but it was always things that made him feel good, but never what mattered to her.

I had to test the different stuff I could fit in there and even a can of pop can be stuck in a pocket.\n\nOne reason I've heard that there are no pockets is because they ruin the lines of the look or something.  I don't buy it.  There are wedding dresses with pockets!   Why can't normal every day pants get them too???  I'm not usually one to go on board with conspiracy ideas, but I've wondered if there is one with women's lack of pockets.  Is it to sell more handbags and purses?   so womencan't hide weapons in them?  Or can't hide snacks?", "This is actually a real thing and not a conspiracy. It had to do with women\u2019s independence. Pretty interesting history.", "Me and my husband are expecting this year and that was the first the he had picked out was a diaper bag that looks like a military style backpack", "My husband is like this! If my purse needs to be carried and I can\u2019t or I\u2019m not, he carries it. No questions, no worries about being emasculated.", "My poor husband is always carrying my shit. He calls himself my pack mule. He's really the best because he just honestly offers all the time (especially when we are shopping for me - which he also does happily).", "My fiance only disputes carrying my purse under circumstances where I could predict that I would need that help *and failed to try to clean out the excess weight*. He's cool with helping, he's annoyed if I have carted around a bunch of clutter that I had the opportunity to leave at home.", "That is so sweet. He sounds very considerate. You've landed a good one :)", "such manly, much wow.\n\nMate I don't even have cargo shorts - am I being masculine wrong?! O:", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t believe in just putting whatever story and motives you want on it. The way it\u2019s told, which is believable is that they are both pretty unpleasant people that I\u2019d rather not be around.", "Yeah I mean if you completely invent your own story you can make the OP seem however you like.", "Oh please, she's acting like a helpless female that needs a male to carry her big, heavy purse. Call her out on that behavior.", "I agree, and to be honest I made the connection when I was thinking about my transition and that hell yeah my femininity is fragile, the context might be different but I find it understandable then realized how we should extend the same empathy to even cis dudes with fragile masculinity and cis women with fragile femininity because gender policing effects and oppresses us all. We should try to confront it but we are all victims of it.", "Is it a stupid reason though?  For those of us that are allies of the trans community, we would totally understand if a trans man was not comfortable carrying a purse or preferred to dress in traditionally male attire. Why can\u2019t a cis man have a similar boundary?", "The DREAM!", "That's what I told the teenager.....", "I have several pairs of yoga pants/leggings now with pockets! They're the best! And my daughter's prom dress had pockets! The times, they are changing...hopefully?", "I'll hold my wife's purse when we're at the mall, and she's trying stuff on, but I may or may not sometimes go get a coffee or something to drink for the both of us but use her card", "Just seems like such an immature viewpoint to have, the emasculation. You already have your partner, who are you trying to convince or appeal to?", "My husband will hold my purse but he'll hold it like it's a dirty diaper! that said, he'll carry anything else, often without being asked.", "yes testicles require a minimum of four pockets.\n\nIt's science.", "A woman asked her partner to help her carry something she's already going to carry herself for the rest of the day. It's normal for couples or people in healthy relationships to trust that they can ask each other for help. The man doesn't have to oblige every request, but sometimes it's nice to help a little extra. If the bag really is too heavy, it's not uncommon to get a nice gift that didn't have to be asked for; like a nice backpack. They aren't egregiously expensive, and that seems to be a common recommendation. Men & women can do this for each other without it being a threat to their identities as men & women. \n\nThe only thing that strikes me as a negative is being worried that you're less of a man for -checks notes- carrying your girlfriend's purse once in a while...\n\nEdit: this is regardless of gender.\n\n\nBeing nice to your partner shouldn't be regarded as a chore either lol", "You are very correct, more empathy would be great. I am a big ol diesel mechanic and I don't feel like a man sometimes, more like a little boy if that makes sense. My wife looks at me like I am a huge, strong man that breaks bones and returns the to work the next day, but when I cuddle her I feel just so small. It's so strange. The fact I can't explain how little I feel when am curled up laying on my wife's chest is beyond strange to me. However if she puts her head on my chest and cuddles me I love it. I push past it but it's been 15 years and I still feel the same way.  I hope my comment helps.", "What did they say?", "This made me laugh\u2026I guess he could use my card, but it\u2019s the same account!\ud83d\ude09", "Lol! Mine puts it on his shoulder\u2026I\u2019ve been known to walk up to him and comment (loudly), \u201ccute purse!\u201d And then he poses with it.", "Ah see, when I was born they forgot the testicles! That explains it. I will look into extra pockets for them in future lol", "He has stated that she asked on numerous occasions, which means she has not dropped it. No it doesn\u2019t mean shut up and never ask again but he said no, which means she should respect that after numerous times of being rejected. Why are you pushing for her to continuously disregard his right to reject her proposal?", "\"Bum bag?! What's that?!\"\n\nI feel old.", "according to my doctorate in cargology they'll grow after a couple months of cargo shorts."]}
