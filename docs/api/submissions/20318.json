If he\u2019s into fashion, he fully understands the concept of the wedding party wearing the same color scheme.", "NTA. HOT PINK? WTF was he thinking, except to make your wedding about him? \n\nYou didn't stop him from wearing a dress. He did, with his complete lack of manners.", "NTA\n\nYou were accommodating and communicated in advance your expectations. BIL tried to sandbag you at the last minute and expected you to just let his AH behavior slide - he should have talked to you before the event about the dress options and would have if he was acting in good faith. You stood up for yourself. Kudos to you and to your husband for backing you.", "NTA\n\nBridal parties generally dress in a way that the party matches. You explained what dress everyone would wear. Going with hot pink shows your BIL was trying to stand out and get attention. That's not appropriate on someone else's big day.", "NTA. What your brother-in-law did was the equivalent or even worse than wearing a wedding gown. What a jerk. You accommodated him and made yourself very clear, but he still wanted to be the center of attention at your wedding. What an asshole.", "NTA. Choosing hot pink instead of one of the preapproved dresses screams \"Look at me\".  His family can get over it. How many of their weddings did he attempt to draw attention to himself by wearing a hot pink dress?", "NTA . You didnt have a problen with your BIL for wearing a dress, you just asked him to respect the same drees code.\n\nAnd knowing there was a theme and color request, he went behind your back and wear the opposite colors and not only that, but also bright versions of it.", "No, you're NTA.  And it's good you have your husband's support.\n\nThat said, you probably should have been more pro-active in approving the dress he wore.  This is fairly common when brides allow leeway in picking dresses.  I'm sure your instructions were clear, like you say, but this is where \"trust but verify\" kicks in. \n\nThat's minor, though.  He's a jerk.", "NTA..... Your brother received some calls from his family about how HE SHOULDNT HAVE LET YOU TALK TO HIS BROTHER LIKE THAT..... thats speaking volumes to me.... anyone else???", "NTA. How dare you make your wedding all about you? He probably expected you to say no to the dress so he had to manufacture another pretext for drama.", "A wedding is an occasion to express support for the bride and groom. Not to express yourself (in colors that hurt the eye of the beholder). And that \"calm down\" is not the thing to say either.\n\nI'd tell his family that I might consider talking to him again after a profound apology. \n\nNTA and kicking him out would have been quite ok too.", "NTA. He just spat in your face and at your wedding. You were very clear about the colours and the tone of your wedding and he decided to make it all about himself by wearing an in your face pink color. To tell you the truth you were way too nice giving him an opportunity to go change because I would have straight up just kicked him out PERIOD.", "Nta bil clearly knew what you wanted because you made it abundantly clear.  He chose to do something else and make himself the main character.   Hot pink for a wedding oh hell no.  He knew better, but he just didn't care.", "NTA...You had a dress-code for your bridal party as most people do.  You gave him the choice of either the suit or the dress, without any judgement.  His reactions seem very immature.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, what the hell? You bent the rules for him, and then he took liberties, and then is surprised that you don't like the liberties he took? You were too polite, OP. If I'd have kicked him out then and there.", "NTA I totally understand your reaction since it was such a surprise on your wedding day. He was just looking forward to be the best looking man in a dress, at your wedding, with no regards to your wishes. When the host tells you to do not wear a hat.. You don't f* wear hat or you don't attend. You should tell your husbands family that its ridiculous to protect someone that acts like a spoiled brat.", "Wow, I've heard of many MILs trying to take the attention off the bride by wearing white, but never the groom's brother.", "You tried to accommodate him and he wore the equivalent of \"taking a dump on your couch\". Even then, you were kind enough to let him stay. I'd have told him GTFO.\n\nNTA.", "NTA plain and simple.", "NTA. Man or woman, bridesmaid or groomsman, you don't blatantly ignore the dress code of the wedding.\n\nIf this was a case of \"oops I didn't realize this was wrong\" or \"you didn't provide any examples, just said \\_\\_\\_ color\" things might be a little more nebulous. But this was clear ignoring of your wishes and blatant disrespect. \n\nIf he wants to go pout about you not letting him do whatever he wants on a day that has nothing to do with him, he can go be a child elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nBIL went out of his way to be as attention grabbing as possible. Poor behaviour to exhibit at someone else's wedding.", "You are definetly NTA !!\nThat moron took advantage of your good will and you have already shown to be very polite and generous towards everyone at YOUR wedding.\n\nYou did not overreact, why does your BIL matter at all? And he insulted you on top of all that? No, girl you deserve better. Concentrate on you and the ones you are truly close to. \n\nThe only one responsible here is him. Don't blame yourself \n\nI've also never heard of a man wearing a dress at a wedding which is to me, completly unnaceptable and weird.\n\nDoes he not know the unspoken rule to not try and take away the attention from the bride??", "NTA.  You made an attempt to be accommodating and your BIL spat in your face because of it.  Your reaction was understandable given the circumstances.  I am guessing from the family's reaction that BIL is the golden child or they are afraid of offending him for whatever reason.  It was his choice to do what he wanted on your and your now husband's day.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn\u2019t like the dress selection, he could have verbalized it. He knew \u2026 I mean let\u2019s be real, ANYONE who has been in a bridal party knows\u2026 there is a dress code (unless told otherwise). \n\nHe knew enough to ask if he could wear a dress, but knew you weren\u2019t going to approve of the one he decided on. \n\nYou were stressed and he was trying to drag his heels in even after his brother spoke to him, meaning he was trying to fight against a united front.", "NTA. Did he think the wedding was about him?", "YTA, not because of what you wanted. That is within your right.  But because of your reaction.  It may have been a high-stress day.

That's kind of like when the mother in law turns up in a wedding dress.", "My sister is in the fashion industry, and if she wanted to wear a suit to my wedding, that would be fine with me but because she\u2019s in the bridal party I would expect her to wear a certain type of suit colour.

He was trying to grab attention by what he was wearing, and that's very inappropriate", "NTA", "NTA - You told him the dress code and he deliberately ignored it.  I would have done the same, change or fuck off.  He tried to outshine you on your wedding day.", "NTA and your brother in law was attention seeking.  Good attention or bad doesn\u2019t seem to matter.", "NTA. Yes, you probably overreacted, but he's TA here. It's not clear whether you explicitly said \"you can wear a dress if it's one of these\" or whether it was just \"this is what the bridesmaids will be wearing\".

What do you think motivated his behavior? Have you had any problems in your relationship with him? Any lingering resentments?

He was obviously in the wrong for ignoring your dresses and choosing whatever he wanted. And he was even rude about it when he arrived at the wedding, so I get your frustration.
