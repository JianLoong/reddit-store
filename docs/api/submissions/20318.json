If he\u2019s into fashion, he fully understands the concept of the wedding party wearing the same color scheme.", "NTA. HOT PINK? WTF was he thinking, except to make your wedding about him? \n\nYou didn't stop him from wearing a dress. He did, with his complete lack of manners.", "NTA\n\nYou were accommodating and communicated in advance your expectations. BIL tried to sandbag you at the last minute and expected you to just let his AH behavior slide - he should have talked to you before the event about the dress options and would have if he was acting in good faith. You stood up for yourself. Kudos to you and to your husband for backing you.", "NTA\n\nBridal parties generally dress in a way that the party matches. You explained what dress everyone would wear. Going with hot pink shows your BIL was trying to stand out and get attention. That's not appropriate on someone else's big day.", "NTA. What your brother-in-law did was the equivalent or even worse than wearing a wedding gown. What a jerk. You accommodated him and made yourself very clear, but he still wanted to be the center of attention at your wedding. What an asshole.", "NTA. Choosing hot pink instead of one of the preapproved dresses screams \"Look at me\".  His family can get over it. How many of their weddings did he attempt to draw attention to himself by wearing a hot pink dress?", "NTA . You didnt have a problen with your BIL for wearing a dress, you just asked him to respect the same drees code.\n\nAnd knowing there was a theme and color request, he went behind your back and wear the opposite colors and not only that, but also bright versions of it.", "No, you're NTA.  And it's good you have your husband's support.\n\nThat said, you probably should have been more pro-active in approving the dress he wore.  This is fairly common when brides allow leeway in picking dresses.  I'm sure your instructions were clear, like you say, but this is where \"trust but verify\" kicks in. \n\nThat's minor, though.  He's a jerk.", "NTA..... Your brother received some calls from his family about how HE SHOULDNT HAVE LET YOU TALK TO HIS BROTHER LIKE THAT..... thats speaking volumes to me.... anyone else???", "NTA. How dare you make your wedding all about you? He probably expected you to say no to the dress so he had to manufacture another pretext for drama.", "A wedding is an occasion to express support for the bride and groom. Not to express yourself (in colors that hurt the eye of the beholder). And that \"calm down\" is not the thing to say either.\n\nI'd tell his family that I might consider talking to him again after a profound apology. \n\nNTA and kicking him out would have been quite ok too.", "NTA. He just spat in your face and at your wedding. You were very clear about the colours and the tone of your wedding and he decided to make it all about himself by wearing an in your face pink color. To tell you the truth you were way too nice giving him an opportunity to go change because I would have straight up just kicked him out PERIOD.", "Nta bil clearly knew what you wanted because you made it abundantly clear.  He chose to do something else and make himself the main character.   Hot pink for a wedding oh hell no.  He knew better, but he just didn't care.", "NTA...You had a dress-code for your bridal party as most people do.  You gave him the choice of either the suit or the dress, without any judgement.  His reactions seem very immature.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, what the hell? You bent the rules for him, and then he took liberties, and then is surprised that you don't like the liberties he took? You were too polite, OP. If I'd have kicked him out then and there.", "NTA I totally understand your reaction since it was such a surprise on your wedding day. He was just looking forward to be the best looking man in a dress, at your wedding, with no regards to your wishes. When the host tells you to do not wear a hat.. You don't f* wear hat or you don't attend. You should tell your husbands family that its ridiculous to protect someone that acts like a spoiled brat.", "Wow, I've heard of many MILs trying to take the attention off the bride by wearing white, but never the groom's brother.", "You tried to accommodate him and he wore the equivalent of \"taking a dump on your couch\". Even then, you were kind enough to let him stay. I'd have told him GTFO.\n\nNTA.", "NTA plain and simple.", "NTA. Man or woman, bridesmaid or groomsman, you don't blatantly ignore the dress code of the wedding.\n\nIf this was a case of \"oops I didn't realize this was wrong\" or \"you didn't provide any examples, just said \\_\\_\\_ color\" things might be a little more nebulous. But this was clear ignoring of your wishes and blatant disrespect. \n\nIf he wants to go pout about you not letting him do whatever he wants on a day that has nothing to do with him, he can go be a child elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nBIL went out of his way to be as attention grabbing as possible. Poor behaviour to exhibit at someone else's wedding.", "You are definetly NTA !!\nThat moron took advantage of your good will and you have already shown to be very polite and generous towards everyone at YOUR wedding.\n\nYou did not overreact, why does your BIL matter at all? And he insulted you on top of all that? No, girl you deserve better. Concentrate on you and the ones you are truly close to. \n\nThe only one responsible here is him. Don't blame yourself \n\nI've also never heard of a man wearing a dress at a wedding which is to me, completly unnaceptable and weird.\n\nDoes he not know the unspoken rule to not try and take away the attention from the bride??", "NTA.  You made an attempt to be accommodating and your BIL spat in your face because of it.  Your reaction was understandable given the circumstances.  I am guessing from the family's reaction that BIL is the golden child or they are afraid of offending him for whatever reason.  It was his choice to do what he wanted on your and your now husband's day.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn\u2019t like the dress selection, he could have verbalized it. He knew \u2026 I mean let\u2019s be real, ANYONE who has been in a bridal party knows\u2026 there is a dress code (unless told otherwise). \n\nHe knew enough to ask if he could wear a dress, but knew you weren\u2019t going to approve of the one he decided on. \n\nYou were stressed and he was trying to drag his heels in even after his brother spoke to him, meaning he was trying to fight against a united front.", "NTA. Did he think the wedding was about him?", "YTA, not because of what you wanted. That is within your right.  But because of your reaction.  It may have been a high-stress day.

He disregarded both. You stuck to your boundary and THAT IS OK!!! \n\nBIL sounds like a drama queen.", "Nta. What kind of groomsmen/bridesmaid that doesnt confirm dress to bride/groom???", "NTA - general observation-People need to be more careful when it comes to weddings man - you can really mess up an important day in someone\u2019s life if you aren\u2019t respectful and careful. This is their wedding day. It\u2019s just another day for him.", "NTA He clearly wanted to be the star of the day and he didn't get that so had a fit", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wedding is your special day. Your BIL wanted to pull a fast one and you nipped that crap in the butt. Don't feel bad. You could talk to the family and tell them the whole story that you did give your BIL guidelines on the colors of the dress but your BIL chose to ignore them. If you are a guest you have to follow the host's rules.", "NTA", "NTA.", "You didn't overreact - AT ALL. He asked to wear a dress, you agreed, and showed him the selections from which he may choose. That was the assignment - end of. For him to choose a completely wrong and distracting color makes him the AH, not you. Hard NTA.", "I can't believe you agreed on him wearing a dress in the first place.", "YTA. He was disrespectful but does anyone really believe that it detracted from the \u201cbride\u2019s big day\u201d?", "NTA. \n\nI was asked by my brother to be his best man. \nI\u2019m female, so the first thing I said when he called to ask was, \u201ccan I wear a suit?\u201d He said yes.  \nTurns out, this never would have been acceptable to my SIL, as she insisted I wear a dress. \nThe whole thing got fucked up fast.", "Wow. While he may express himself with fashion, his choices and attitude says so much. The fact he couldn\u2019t select from preapproved dresses and then had the nerve to call you a bridezilla says it all. He has huge case of main character syndrome. Your husband\u2019s family don\u2019t get a say. They should have taught him to be gracious, not make someone\u2019s wedding his runway. NTA", "BIL ITA", "Info:\n\nIt's not really needed but could you tell us what color scheme you had? It will give a better picture on how much your BIL's choice clashed with the theme.", "NTA. He was intentionally causing drama.", "Nope.  He wanted to stand out.  He had every intention of stealing that spotlight.  He\u2019s young and likely wanted it for social clout.\n\nYou are absolutely not wrong.", "NTA. The second some goes with \"calm down\" all bets are off.", "NTA", "I would have flipped a freaking lid too. That\u2019s obnoxious. Bye Felicia \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "Your BIL sounds like a self centred drama queen. He was hoping to upstage you. And then tells his family how you \u2018treated\u2019 him after he shrugs off how he didn\u2019t like any of the dresses you had selected and goes for something completely different? NTA. I hope he lives somewhere far away.", "NTA, you said yeah within limits, and he had disagreements to those limits that he never expressed. depending on your color palette, highlighter pink is just tacky. depending on the cuts of the dresses you chose and his dress, it could be attention grabbing, and double tacky.", ">in colors that hurt the eye of the beholder\n\nHah!", "It was about the colour not the clothing dude", "I wonder if he was expecting more drama about him wearing a dress and since he didn't get the attention he wanted there, he went out of his way to be an ass.", ">If he\u2019d been a guest OP would be Y T A\n\nNo, if he was a guest OP would still be NTA. Because wearing a hot pink dress at what is otherwise a formal wedding would be distracting from anyone, and he has no right to use someone else's ceremony as an attempt to become the center of attention.", "Exactly what I posted. Ughh.", "Eh, my queer of honor wore a dress, and they're AMAB. I didn't feel like the attention was taken at all. It's the hot pink that's the faux pas, not the dress.", "The problem isn't that BIL went against gender norms. The problem is he intentionally tried to be an attention-hog.", "Exactly. I wouldn\u2019t have even allowed him to wear a dress period. It\u2019s a wedding, not a freak show.", "Mhmm I had my bridemaids add their dress choices into one basket on a website so it would all be ordered together. Made it easier for the shipment and we all got to see each others choices before ordering!", "Same thought here.", "Yeah, this doesn't sound like somebody who wants to express themselves through fashion, or is maybe exploring their gender expression, this sounds like somebody who doesn't like OP and was looking for her to kick up a fuss, and then get to use that fuss as evidence that she's high maintenance or something.", "Yes, the one who has never worn a dress before, but decided that a family member's wedding was the perfect time to debut his new look. And then got upset when he didn't get the attention he was seeking.", "Yes", "Him wearing a dress didn't make it a \"freak show\" what a horrible thing to say. Clothing isn't gendered. The knly issue in this story his him wearing hot pink, not that he wore a dress, not that he asked to wear one, purely the fact that the dress of choice didn't match the wedding aesthetic the bride and groom put in place for their wedding. AGAIN I WILL REPEAT HIM WEARING A DRESS IS NOT THE PROBLEM!", "You're totally right but* as the mom of a 23 year old male, I will say the immaturity is still pretty high at that age. *Not wear a hot pink fkn dress to a wedding immaturity without a change of clothes immature*, but still immature as hell. She's 100% NTA.", "Yeah, if it was a dress that still fit the general rules for wedding guest dresses, I'd think he was just clueless, but I don't think I would turn up to any weddings in a hot pink highlighter colour dress unless I had previously discussed that with the bride, and that's not even accounting for the fact that he's in the bridal party. He did it on purpose.", "Oh he gives a f alright.", "I\u2019m sorry, but a man in a dress draws attention and I wouldn\u2019t want that at my wedding. I\u2019m not sure where in the world its culturally acceptable for men to dress like women, besides at drag shows. It\u2019s universally strange.", "That's rather hard at a wedding. Just because you ignore them doesn't mean the rest of the party will.", "If you wouldn't want it at your wedding then say no but not everyone cares about it. Some people (like op seems to be because she didn't care and even sent over dress choices) are completely ok with men wearing a dresses. If you are uncomfortable with that it is your decision. My mom's wedding, the best man wore an orange dress like the bridal party.", "What area are y\u2019all in? I haven\u2019t been to a place in the US where that\u2019s normal and wouldn\u2019t draw attention", "NTA. Sounds like very bratty behavior. Has he behaved like this before? Might explain why your husband\u2019s family is giving him a hard time. They\u2019ve spoiled & overindulged his brother.", "NTA  \nBut you over reacted.   \nYour requirements were fair and obvious. You communicated them well. He showed up in something that was going to completely trash your aesthetic AND make him stand out like nobody\u2019s business.   \nYour requirement for him to change or leave was fair.   \nIt was just the screaming that was too much\u2026 but I assume you were pushed to the wall on that.", "Was he a part of your wedding? Of he was in the wedding then be mad. If he wasn't then yes you overreacted.", "NTA. BIL is a narcissist begging to be the center of attention which you should have known when he asked to wear a dress.", "Her \"meltdown\" got results. The attention chaser knew he was on very thin ice and went to change. If she didn't do it \"her memory of that day\" would be feeling uncomfortable and powerless throughout.", "I wonder if he\u2019s just an attention hog or hates OP?", "Yeah it\u2019s obvious he chose \u201cask forgiveness not permission\u201d but was not prepared that the groom will have an extra suit and will stand up for his wife-to-be. I don\u2019t get all the drama and rules around the weddings but I can imagine that him wearing that hot pink dress would result in the wedding becoming memorable mainly because of his scandalous outfit not because of the main objective and that sucks. Even if there were 5 women running around in white dresses, it would never be as memorable as him wearing that hot pink dress unless everyone is wearing something outstanding.", "He wore a dress dude", "Doesn't mean he's gay", "I thought he chose a white dress. Not necessarily a wedding dress but a white dress.", "Me too, lol", "My partner says \"trust but verify\" all the time and it drives me mad \ud83d\ude02 Like, I'll say something, then he looks it up, and is like: you're right. I know I was right. Imo, if you need to verify, then you didn't trust. FWIW, he's an engineer, on the inspection side", "Certainly more than me (67f).", "Electrician here, we have a similar rule when de-energizing circuits. I might trust my coworker opening the circuit, but I'm going to test it every time before risking my life, and I expect everyone else to test any circuit I open. At the end of the day, I don't want to be responsible for one of my coworkers not going home. I wouldn't ever say \"trust but verify\" on the jobsite, though. I'd get made fun of till the day I retire.", "Lol", "Lol I'm about to turn 48 (f)\n\nOne of the best things that happened at my wedding was the make-up lady not showing up. My fairy godbrother (my nickname for him that he kept and loves)...came into the room and said he would do my makeup. His husband had gone home to get his kit. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI rarely ever wear makeup. We hadn't even had a make-up rehearsal. He just asked me to trust him. It was sooo much better than even the \"professional\" had done. Lol", "Yeah thinking about it I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d choose that colour as a guest at a wedding, let alone wedding party\u2026", "Yeah if it was a genuine faux pas he\u2019d have been mortified & happily worn the suit. He knew what he was doing I think.", "Not at all. There other ways of dealing with situations like this than just devolving into a screaming row.  Delegating the problem to someone else, especially on your wedding day, should be the default. No, actually the default should be your friends and family making sure you don't have to delegate by getting between you and any unexpected problems.", "i don't want to take credit for this, since i saw it mentioned in the prior skirt to a wedding thread a few days ago, but this guy too seems to be manufacturing oppression to try to be a victim/martyr. and unfortunately behavior like this is manufacturing real negative sentiment in more and more people in general.", "I actually thought that she was going to say exactly that lol.", "This reminded me of that one story off Reddit where a guy kicked out pretty much all female members of his family because they showed up to his wedding in white when he told them not to because to them it was \u201cjust a joke\u201d they were basically hazing her. They would always bully and belittle her.", "Well, if it doesn't matter, why have a wedding in the first place? Why decorate at all? Why try to make anything pretty? If the vows are the only thing that matters everyone should just go to a courthouse and call it a day.\n\nPeople are allowed to want nice weddings. If someone chooses to put in a lot of effort into the day to have their dream event, that's okay. Let people enjoy things.", "I wonder if he was after the \"bad reaction\" and expected it when asking to wear a dress. Perhaps the ready acceptance was disappointing for him and he had to go further to get his reaction.", "The bride has absolutely no reason to ever apologise here.  Her BiL wanted everything to be about him - this wasn't hazing.  \n\nOr, do you think that 'It was just a joke\" and everyone should just lighten up?", "And beat her with that leg.", "He thought it was weird that his *BIL* didn't comment on his black pleated skirt\n\nAnd then got mad when his mom answered \"Everyone looks nice at a wedding\" when he shared that his gma gushed about how nice it looked", "YTA. Ready for the downvotes. Can't believe you threat to kicked someone out because the dress was ~~pink and not \"muted ros\u00e9\"~~ not the color you dictated. How entitled can someone be? And I also can't believe it is considered to be common that the bride exactly choose what to wear and that's the law then.", "NTA at all! I\u2019m sure his full intention was to put the focus on himself, either that or he is completely dense to etiquette. I did a stint as a wedding coordinator so I feel I\u2019ve seen a lot of craziness but this one\u2026 Your being upset over this in no way makes you a bridezilla. I\u2019m sorry you even had to deal with that on your day. Congratulations!!!", "He should also know by now that it's a longstanding tradition for at least one of the dress wearing members of the bridal party to hate their dress.", "I just want to point out that that\u2019s definitely not the norm in a lot of places. I read about wedding party dress codes all the time on AITA and I always feel conflicted because the concept of color-coordinated wedding parties is just not something I\u2019m used to, and to me it instinctively feels like an AH move to require people to wear a specific color in the first place. That being said, I understand that in many places (particularly the USA) it is the cultural norm and going against it is an AH move.", "A muted ros\u00e9 wasn\u2018t a color represented in the bridal party either; all of the dresses on the list were either a shade of green or brown. I simply wanted to emphasize what shade of pink that dress was, thus the comparison between muted ros\u00e9 and hot pink. I wouldn\u2019t have appreciated a pale pink dress either.", "A bit on-the-nose in the drama queen department \n\nI can understand not wanting to wear a bridesmaids dress, they\u2019re generally not attractive and may likely not suit his figure, but you know he was just trying to be a PITA", "he could\u2019ve worn a suit, if it was hot pink he still would\u2019ve stood out", ">Don\u2019t apologize unless he does first\n\nHell, even if he apologises, OP has no need to offer an apology herself!", "mmm that sounds really enabling. as a 23 yr old female I did not fuck with any of my friends weddings, no double standards plz.", "In Canada"]}
