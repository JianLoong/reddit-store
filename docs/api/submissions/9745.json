My daughter is in college and has challenges similar to you. She also needs to focus and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to switch seats if others are disruptive. It\u2019s unfair to those who are there to learn but are distracted by the behavior of others. Those girls are immature and have zero consideration for everyone else in the class. I hope they got the message.", "NTA\n\nYou have to do what you need to do to focus in class.    \n\nPersonally, I would have told them to shut up.  \nBut that's me.  \n\nTry not to feel embarrassed for getting up and moving.   First, no one really cares, and second, what difference will it make in a month, six months, five years?   None.   \n\nSo do what you have to do to succeed and try not to let dumb people ruin it for you.", "NTA. You're paying good money for the course, you have a right to hear it.

Glad the professor had your back.", "NTA at all, don't overthinking this", "He literally thanked you for doing something, don\u2019t let that self destruct function in your brain take over. NTA. (I also have ADHD and anxiety, so I know how it works)", "NTA Stop overthinking this. This is a very typical situation. Nothing to worry about whatsoever. If the professor said they were glad you moved because it alerted them about the minor disruption, WHY ARE YOU STILL THINKING about it??? Stop INTERPRETING other peoples words with YOUR OWN THOUGHTS. The professor said thank you, they MEANT THANK YOU. There is no subtext to that, there is only your professor being gracious. \n\nAdults in college, and their professors typically say what they mean and mean what they say. I'm guessing you grew up with some passive-aggressive, narcissistic or \"non-confrontational to the point of never saying anything\" type of peronalities in the household...at the very least some sort of dysfunction was going on and that is why you are trying to analyze a frank, open and honest conversation. \n\nPlease get into the habit of ACCEPTING that people typically mean what they say, you can adjust your internal dialogue when dealing with family, but please stop assuming the rest of the world means a different thing than they tell you. Most of us just want to exchange information as efficiently as possible. I know it's hard to navigate new things when you grow up hearing words and are used to translating them into what you believe the person wants, that's how you adapt to survive; but once out in the bigger world, you need to readapt to taking people's words at their exact value and accept there are very few hidden meanings in what people are saying. Good luck, and please turn off your interpreter brain when at college, you will be happier and you will find you can actually learn more when you aren't trying so hard to get the meaning, because the meaning is right there, no hidden or subtle undertones of anything else.", "why are you on here? you already addressed the situation directly. he said you aren\u2019t an asshole, you gotta move forward.", "NTA. You are paying to be there to learn. They need to grow up and save the chat for after class.", "NTA and honestly, moving was the best action you could\u2019ve taken here. It minimizes disruption for others and you get immediate results.", "Former professor here, you are 100% NTA. \n\n(I had a lecture hall where I could sit in the audience with a microphone and advance my slides from my seat. I liked to sit among the whisperers periodically throughout the semester\u2026I would ask them to stop talking but if it continued\u2026.hi, I\u2019m sitting next to them. But, that\u2019s a bit childish of me whereas your response was very professional.)", "NTA.  You are paying to listen to the professor, not the ill-mannered girls in your class.  Pretty sure your professor wants everyone to be able to listen to him as well. You were not doing anything wrong by moving away from the disruptive classmates even if it did bring them to the professor's attention in a bad way.", "NTA\n\nTake your professor at his word.Doesn't seem like he has any issue with what you did and probably appreciates that you actually want to listen and learn in his class.", "As someone who\u2019s taken chemistry and has ADHD, NTA. My prof would always let me move if someone wasn\u2019t being quiet. And they\u2019d talk to them about it too.", "NTA ur good", "NTA.  Those girls are TA, for disrupting the class and carrying on a conversation.", "YTA", "OP, you sound like you might struggle with anxiety. No judgment. I do too.

He doesn\u2019t feel terrible, the professor knew why he moved.\n\nNot sure I even believe the story as told."]}
