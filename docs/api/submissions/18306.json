If I were you, I\u2019d be going somewhere else for Memorial Day bbq, because \u201cit was insane I couldn\u2019t see my significant other for no other reason than my sister\u2019s boyfriend makes no effort to be part of our family.\u201d  That is so disrespectful to you and your s.o.", "NTA, go spend Memorial Day somewhere else, leave the drama llamas to it", "NTA. It is ridiculous.", "Oh wow, I'm sorry OP. Your parents are so out of line! I personally would not go and have my own party, and calmly explain why.", "NTA. Wtf OP?!?! Is your sister the golden child? Honestly, tell your mom to pound sand because that is completely messed up, unfair,  and cruel. You deserve better from your own family", "NTA.  But why do anything that day?  I had to look up what memorial day was and it's about civil war.  Literally a war on stolen Indigenous land between Yanks and slave traders.  That's weird", "Let me get this straight. Your sister, who has reached the age to have her brain fully developed, is throwing a temper tantrum where she thinks she's entitled to decide that if her SO won't come to things, your SO cannot be there. And your mom is siding with her in this nonsense. She's obviously the GC. The audacity here is more than palpable.\n\nIt looks like she's trying to \"be an adult\" by having a boyfriend that's 14 years older than her but at the same time she's being a baby (she hasn't reached toddler yet). The age difference is not important BUT at the ages they both are, they are in different life stages, which is not usually good. He either has no interest or is playing hard to get or something, maybe both or maybe he's a toddler, who knows. In any case, you're NTA, not one bit. Your mother and sister are huge AH. Be petty and try to enforce the rule on her. Also, tell your bf to come and say \"you forgot\" to tell him he's no longer invited. If your mom and sis try to say something you can tell them they are being rude and word could spread out and paint them as the AHs they are. I'm sure they won't be happy about that and let him stay. By doing that not only are you not being rude, you're also making a power move. Best of luck! <3", "NTA. What is this shit ? Lmao I would go hang with bf elsewhere", "This rule sounds utterly asinine. NTA", "I guess we see who is the golden child of the parents.\n\nI'm so sorry, OP, that you are being treated like this.  NTA", "Seriously though, I wonder if Steve declined because he knew that it would cause drama with OP's family. It's ridiculous really.", "This exactly. Is your sister so sensitive that her feelings are taken into account for everything?  WTH. I'd boycott and go spend time with your BF. NTA of course.", "Your mom seems insane.  NTA", "Tell me who the golden child is without telling he who the golden child is.", "Don\u2019t ask. Get up and go. Shop with bf for some brats (very hard to mess up if you\u2019re not familiar with grilling yet). Play summer tunes. GTFO\n\nUpdate dad if you must. Ignore mom completely. Don\u2019t even leave her on read\n\nNTA", "The biggest clarification I\u2019m looking for is: Your parents are basing this disinvite on the __possibility__ of your sister being hurt? How often does this crap happen? How sensitive is your sister that simply seeing your BF there is going to upset her?", "Please don\u2019t \u201crecommend\u201d \u201cnot speaking\u201d to someone you\u2019re having a disagreement with. It\u2019s such a destructive pattern that doesn\u2019t help resolve anything. But I agree with OP canceling on family to hang out with boyfriend.", "Some parents have favourites and act accordingly.", "I agree, mum is unrationally angry about this.  Is there something going on with Steve or is this normal behavior for her? If so, you need to recognize that she uses emotions and manipulation to control you.  You are an adult. You make your own decisions regardless of where you live.", "In my mental gymnastics\u2014\n\nWhile the 35 year old is an obvious creeper, turns out 24 year old is violent because reasons and creeper protects the family from harm", "Being called a bitch is not a disagreement. It is healthy to set a boundary and say that I don't appreciate being talked to like that, and until you can communicate with respect, I don't want to talk.", "Left a \"silent treatment\" guy after way too long, have to agree. But yes, OP should skip the BBQ and make plans with the boyfriend. Her parents are ridiculous and uninviting due to someone else's declination and sister's babyishness is just weird.", "NTA.  Your parents are the real AHs here - how long has your baby sister been the favored one?   Personally, I'd pick up Ben and go to a community-sponsored event or a friend's place if you have been invited.  Let your mother explain to everyone that you aren't there because your sister is too intimidated by your relationship with Ben to be in his presence without Steve to hold her hand.", "NTA and now you know who the golden child is...can't upset sister.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your mother and sister are being ridiculous.", "Tell your parents the deal isn't that Ben can only go if Steve is going. Tell them the deal is that YOU will only go if Ben is going. And follow through. If they don't let him go, don't go under any circumstance. If you do not put your foot down here, then you WBTAH", "NTA. Wtf.  Maybe your sister should be taking notes on what a good bf acts like.  I'd double down and go hang with Ben.  Your father is not being neutral.  He's being a coward.", "INFO\n\nWhy is Steve **_SO_ much** older than your sister?", "NTA", "Why would it hurt your sister\u2019s feelings if your boyfriend accepted an invitation, which her boyfriend declined? Are people,going to be disinvited to Thanksgiving based on who does not accept an invitation?\n\nWhy does Steve get to decide for Ben?", "NTA\n\nThis is the weirdest arbitrary random rule ever lol\n\nDo they dislike Ben for some reason?\n\nSince they dislike Steve (due to age perhaps?) You would think they'd be more than content he isn't available. \n\nSeems like there must be more going on here. Where does your sister stand on this issue? Does she agree that Ben shouldn't be invited because her precious little feelings are hurt that her own bf isn't coming? \n\nSo weird all around", "This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\n\nSteve was invited but can't come to the BBQ. What in the hell does that have to do with you and your BF?? \n\nNTA, but your mom sure is.", "NTA, I will not entertain your mom and your sister's nonsense. Just grab your bf and have your own celebration. Petty me will take dad out for dinner or a drink later too.", "NTA, this is a ridiculous ruling for your parents (also not to be judgy, but 21 and 35, really? sus)", "WOW NTA. Such petty behavior from your family. I would skip the BBQ.", "If your story is legit, You are SO not the asshole.  (While we\u2019re on the topic, why won\u2019t AI recognize that WE CUSS!?!??)", "NTA what kind of nonsense is this?  Your parent s have coddled her into a relationship with an older guy they dislike.", "Make plans with your boyfriend and skip the bbq. NTA", "Oh, pandering to a snowflake such fun", "NTA\n\nThere are plenty of festivals going on this weekend.  The two of you don't have to show up at all.", "This is absolutely crazy. Both boyfriends were invited, that's as far as anybody needs to go.\n\nNTA.\n\nBut you're 23, you could just not attend this Memorial Day thing, you're not a kid, you don't have to go everywhere your parents tell you to.", "If your mother thinks that this is in any way rational or fair she's an insane idiot. She extended the invitation now it's his choice to show up or not. It has nothing to do with you and Ben. \nWhat kind of a jerk is your sister that she can't be in Bens company without Steve by her side? If she has a problem she needs to take it up with him. \nDo not go to this BBQ, tell them they can feel bad every time they look around because you aren't there. Don't back down, you need to assert yourself and not accept this kind of foolishness.\nYou are NTA in any way!!", "I think Ben is not old enough to be invited.", "It doesn't make sense at all.", "This makes zero sense. YTA for posting it.", "If it was me I\u2019d tell bf to show up anyways and tell parents \u201che didn\u2019t get the message in time\u201d odds are (I don\u2019t know your fam) they\u2019ll just let him hang out to save the drama of causing a scene", "Absolutely. I would definitely not attend. Her mom is a fucking asshole for making these ridiculous rules, and I don't even know where to start with the sister so I just... won't. NTA, OP. But maybe it's time to make a stand, start spending holidays with your bf so they know he isn't just a +1 to your sister's (much older) boyfriend", "I came here to say this!! I have a feeling the sister would be elated to not have anyone to compete with and have more focus on her and Steve.", "Supposedly it would upset her because she would be the only one there that didn't have a partner with them.", "They met at work (they are both servers) and hit it off. This is the first relationship either of them have been in where there's been this much of a gap.", "How does that make me an AH for posting it...? I genuinely wanted to see if I was in the wrong in this situation.", "This age gap isn't always predatory, but imo it's safe to assume it is in some way during the early stages of the relationship until proven otherwise", "You aren\u2019t. Your parents are being ridiculous. Go out with your boyfriend.", "I apologize. But it seems some context is missing. Why in the hell would he not be invited? What's wrong with your family?", "I\u2019m betting she moved in with him, because she didn\u2019t like mom and dad\u2019s house rules. Rules that are likely\nlogical and reasonable.", "Part of it (I'm guessing?) is because my sister moved 2 hours away from us, so we rarely see her and my mom didn't want any distractions from Ben? I legitimately have no clue.", "Logical and reasonable like \u201cif your sister\u2019s boyfriend doesn\u2019t come, then yours can\u2019t either\u201d?\n\nHopefully you just left off the \u201c/s\u201d", "How common is stuff like this for your parents to do? Like was this kind of out of nowhere? Because I\u2019m genuinely interested if it is unusual, what in particular about the situation has her concerned?\n\nIf anything, seeing her sister\u2019s BF enjoying time with the family seems like a decent wake-up call if her current BF isn\u2019t her match. And if he is then having your BF there won\u2019t matter.", "NTA for what you said", "If they don\u2019t like your sister\u2019s inappropriately aged partner, why would they want him there. Sounds like little sister is a delicate snowflake that is manipulating them. Hard Pass from me dawg. NTA", "This feels like it could be a sequel to 10 things I hate about you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, go do something fun with your bf instead", "Nta that\u2019s just messed up", "NTA\n\nGo hang with him on memorial day. The whole day. Leave early && tell them to have a good day, then don't answer any questions and peel off. Block all their numbers and enjoy your holiday", "Okay, so up until this point, I was with your parents not liking Steve, and I could see that if they invited your BF they'd kinda have to invite Steve to prevent drama. I could also KINDA *understand* - not \"agree with,\" but \"understand\" - if Steve doesn't come then they don't wanna hear your sister yapping and whining about it for the next three months if your bf comes. (Steve refuses the invitation, that's on him, which is why I 100% disagree with it, but as a person with a yappy family member, i can understand parents not wanting to hear that crap and trying to avoid it at all costs). \n\nBut coming in to call you a bitch? Okay, that's it. I can't even understand that one. Screw it. Get some brats and marinate them in beer, get some good mustard, a grill at your bf's place, and call it a day. Enjoy your day!", "Your sister is very immature. Please do not yield to her bullshit. It will only progressively get worse if people indulge her selfish whims.", "It\u2019s weird that it doesn\u2019t make sense to you so you assume OP is leaving something out instead of considering her family is being ridiculous (like OP says)\n\n>I told my parents that it was insane I couldn't see my significant other for no other reason than my sister's boyfriend makes no effort to be part of our family", "Sometimes, going no contact is the best thing for all involved, even if one party is upset with it. \nSometimes, things can't be resolved. \nSometimes, things are just toxic.", "But Steve was invited, so that distraction was welcomed?\nINFO: why is Steve not going?", "There's a difference between being given the silen treatment, and choosing to not be in a conversation with toxic immaturity."]}
