Go hangout with your bf instead if your family is going to be AH\n\nETA- \nMaybe your sister should date someone her own fluffin age, the freak she getting so sensitive about if your boyfriend is there just cause hers sucks.", "NTA. Go hang out with Ben. Just because you live with your parents doesn't mean you can't live your own life. This situation is absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA - sister is golden child? How is your bf being there going to upset her? If I was you- I wouldn't go either. Go do something with Ben. There is no such thing as neutral in this case - your dad is enabling this.", "NTA so your boyfriend is invited \u2026 but only if your sister\u2019s boyfriend also goes to the bbq??? Make it make sense \n\nDo you think your sister will be upset if your boyfriend is there whiles hers isn\u2019t?", "NTA. \n\nThere\u2019s a really weird family dynamic here, one way or the other.

Why should your sister's BF's plan have any affect on you are your BF's plans. That makes NO sense.\n\nDo yourself a favor. You and your BF make plans to do something together and skip the family drama BS!", "NTA and this is extreme favoritism in my opinion. \n\nAlso, your sister\u2019s BF is a grown ass man.

He made a choice not to come. Your sister has no right to be upset at anyone other than her boyfriend.

That is super rude for them to invite your boyfriend and then resind it just because your sisters creep of a boyfriend is coming.\n\nI\u2019m 29 almost 30 and I wouldn\u2019t date a 20/21 that\u2019s just wrong.

The math doesn't add up.  This doesn't pass the smell test.  Can anyone else think of another quip to describe sister's and mom's reasoning here?
