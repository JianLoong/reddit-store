A cold requires a virus of the upper respiratory tract. \nIf your baby gets all snotty from eating chicken it is not a cold", "NTA - Yes, it got heated but food allergies are no joke.

I would only allow contact again after they both send some kind of essey or something simmiliar in regards to allergies and how they work.  \n\n\nOh and a word in regards to the defense, that it's a virus.  \nYes, it might be a virus, that stuff happens even if you watch closely and try to avoid any kind of contamination.
