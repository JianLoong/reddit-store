The allergy is related to the protein in chicken and if you lick it, you can ingest it. Once on the tongue, saliva can carry it the stomach.

You are absolutely NTA and your family is completely out of line. \n\nIf you want them to take this more seriously, however, it might be helpful to \u201cspeak their language\u201d. You may want to arm yourself with as much information as possible so that you can explain exactly how allergies can lead to things like sinus infections, and how they can lower the immune system so that viruses can be caught more easily. Saying that licking chicken directly caused \u201ca virus\u201d (something that must be caught from someone or something carrying that same virus) may have caused them to lose faith in your understanding of your child\u2019s medical issues.

If they refuse to listen you are in your right to yell at them.\n\nNow a question about the allergy. How the heck do you get a cold from an allergy. A cold requires a virus of the upper respiratory tract. \nIf your baby gets all snotty from eating chicken it is not a cold", "NTA - Yes, it got heated but food allergies are no joke. If your sister knew your baby is allergic to chicken she shouldn't have allowed the wee one anywhere near it.", "NTA  it doesn't matter what you have asked someone to not give your child...obviously unless the child is malnourished....if the parent says the child can't have anything (with or without an allergy, but especially with!) Then others need to follow that or they are no longer allowed around the child", "NTA , Only the Parents get a say in what a Baby can and can't eat . Nobody else regardless of their \"credentials\" or relationship has a right to overstep your boundaries and you were right to get mad.", "yes they are all aware. \n\nshe is an obgyne", "Agreed, but I think OP also needs to learn more about how allergies work in order to best protect their child. \nSome allergies have a \"threshold amount\" or can have a delayed exposure reaction, while others are instant or react to minute amounts. \n\nFor some people with some allergies, a small amount or a lick might be fine. For others it could be deadly.\n\nLife will be easier for OP & her kid in the long run if they work out exactly how they react and to what.", "Maybe she meant the same symptoms as a cold? Runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes etc.?", "In that case completely NTA\n\nWith very few exceptions, like neglect or other endangerment, it is ALWAYS the parents decision what to feed and what NOT to feed their baby, ESPECIALLY in regards to allergies.\n\nThis kind of bullshit is definitly a reason to go no contanct with them (at least for a while).  \nWhile it isn't a severe allergie, it very well could be. I would only allow contact again after they both send some kind of essey or something simmiliar in regards to allergies and how they work.  \n\n\nOh and a word in regards to the defense, that it's a virus.  \nYes, it might be a virus, that stuff happens even if you watch closely and try to avoid any kind of contamination. But that is no f\\*\\*\\*\\*ing excuse, to do something you KNOW will hurt the baby.\n\n  \nHope the little one is well again", "Maybe, but it's not like it is something you can safely test.

That type of behavior will not stop if you just let this go.  It sounds extreme but I really don't think it is. This is a big deal.\n\nAs for your mom, I think it's reasonable to make it very clear to her that to have a relationship with your child, you are in charge of what is \"safe\" and it is not up for debate.  That is a non-negotiable requirement for the relationship.", "Info: what kind of docter is your mother", "I'm just hoping it wasn't raw chicken.", "NTA from posts and people doctors for parents are usually the worst.

I can only use celiac as an example. But i know a few people that can\u2019t even have particles pass their mouth and they are having a really bad reaction. Licking something is most definitely ingesting the item. Honestly id be limiting contact especially unsupervised contact with anyone willing to put my child in danger. All it takes is one time for that mild allergy to turn severe and life threatening. We don\u2019t go to an allergist to get medical advice on cancer or pregnacy. Why would u go to an OB for advice on allergies.", "Lol, you know all doctors do 7 years of med school right? Obgyn is just her specialty, after those 7 years.

Her specialty is not allergies.", "Not to argue but just throwing this out there. So my son had differing opinions about the Covid vaccine. Some pediatricians were for and some against.
