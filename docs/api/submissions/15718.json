Most oral allergies happen within 15 minutes of exposure. It sounds like from your story that there was a bit of time between the exposure and when she got the sniffles. Your baby could also get colds from adults that aren't even exhibiting noticeable symptoms since some viruses affect children more than adults. \n\nBut again - the utter lack of respect your sister and mother showed for you regarding your daughter is concerning.

People can easily spread viruses before they get sick or without getting sick at all or without direct contact at all, so despite doing everything you can the baby could just have gotten a cold. But none of that justifies exposing the baby to a known allergen, and that's got to be one of the worst brain farts a medical professional could have - I'm 99% sure they are emotionally covering their asses/gaslighting OP in this scenario because how could you possibly not know if you work in medicine?", "Should have some knowledge of babies though."]}
