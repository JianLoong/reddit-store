I recently went on a trip to the US after saving my salary for one year (the dollar is very expensive for us)\n\nI really enjoyed the sights and food, but was shocked at how extortionist the tipping culture is there! I had read that not tipping is considered rude, so I had kept a little tipping money. But I was completely unprepared for the kind of rude, threatening behaviour that I encountered.\n\nWe took the Big Bus to explore NY When we were done, the conductor blocked the exit gate and did not let the tourists get off without handing enough tip for the driver and himself. We handed him a couple of bucks, and he hurled abuses as we ran off.\n\nNext, we (my parents aged 70 and me, 38F) went to a self serve Froyo place. Even though we served ourselves, the payment tab had a big display asking us to choose a tip. We skipped it and the cashier glared at us and made snark remarks about us being \"cheap tourists\". \n\nAnother time, we went to a nice dine-in place. We chose a 10% tip to avoid the glares and rude behaviour from the last time. But yet again, we were given glares by the waiter. I think they were expecting more. For me, that 10% was more than my 1 day salary back home.\n\nThe threats completely ruined our holiday. Everywhere we went, to buy water, coffee, hotdog - everyone badgered us to tip. As someone who comes from a culture where people are really polite and laid back, this was really shocking and upsetting.\n\nI also read that if you can't afford to tip, then don't go out. I personally feel that is absurd. You can't expect tourists to make up the difference for your wages! And tourists come from all backgrounds. Not all can afford to tip. We did tip wherever we could but being bullied and threatened to tip was very shocking. \n\nSo AITA for not tipping enough?", "created_utc": 1672406732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz0h2x/aita_for_not_tipping_enough_as_a_tourist_in_the_us/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I traveled through Europe recently and researched tipping in the countries we visited beforehand. Tips are usually built into tabs there, whereas they are not built in in the US. \n\nIn the US, 15-20% is considered customary. This is largely due to the fact that we have a \u201ctipped wage\u201d- most businesses that accept tips pay ~$2.17/hr and will only make up the difference to an hourly minimum wage if the server doesn\u2019t get enough from their tips alone. \n\nThat being said, I live in the US and am mortified that you were shouted at for tipping smaller or not at all- just because it\u2019s considered a little rude here doesn\u2019t mean people get to yell at you or hurl insults your way, and I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.", "Part of being a good traveler is researching local customs/culture. In the case of visiting the US, that includes tipping. Which you admit you knew. What you didn\u2019t seem to know is that under tipping is basically more offensive than no tip at all. \n\nA 10% tip is not sufficient. That more communicates \u201cyou did a shit job\u201d.\n\nThe US isn\u2019t the only country with a tipping culture either. There are many countries I can think of where you tip the bathroom attendant, the doorman, the bus driver, the maid, the sommelier, and so forth. Heck there are some countries where I have to tip/pay to get on an airplane (in addition to my ticket). \n\nYTA but I\u2019m sorry that people were unkind.", "YTA. \n\ni'm sorry that you had a poor experience in America, but as you said you knew of the cultural\nexpectations beforehand and you decided not to follow them.\n\ni don't like tipping culture, i think it's immoral to expect customers to supplement employees' wages, but the fact is that the employees *are* severely underpaid, and not tipping enough (around 20%) *is* considered rude.\n\ni understand that this was an expensive trip for you, but you chose to ignore local customs knowing it would insult people who probably make, comparatively, as much as you do. that's extremely rude.", "TIPS are very important in restaurants because servers get paid less than minimum wage on the premise their wage will be at least minimum with TIPS.  18-20% is acceptable standard. More than 20% means servjce was amazing. \n\nTipping people for helping you with your suitcases (hotels, airport transfers) isn\u2019t required but highly recommended and been part of normal culture for decades ($1/bag). \n\nTipping people at fast food or counter service restaurants (like yogurt) place is not required. Yesterday, friends and I were talking about how annoying it is to have that \u201ctip\u201d option pop up when you\u2019re paying for counter service food. I rarely do it. The staff are getting paid at least minimum wage. If their employer is an AH and using \u201ctips\u201d as a way to have lower wages, that\u2019s on the employer. There are tons of places hiring AND many fast food places are offering $18+ an hour, which is a lot more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 (no comment as to whether the minimum wage is reasonable).\n\nIf someone refuses to let you off a tour bus without tipping, that\u2019s illegal.\n\nI\u2019m going to say soft YTA because there are a lot of resources you could\u2019ve used to find out this information before traveling.", "I'm an American and I hate tipping. It's gotten to the point were people expect tips for things they are not even doing! I'm tired of the excuses. Get a different job people!\n\nSide note, that froyo experience made me roll my eyes. In college I worked at a self serve froyo shop. Did we have a tipping jar, yes. Did we expect people to tip, no. If people paid with card they never tipped, or if they did the staff sure was not seeing it. As for the physical money, tips were almost always given because the cash payers did not want to carry change.", "YTA \n\nIt's not \"tourists,\" it's everyone. It might be stupid, but engrained enough that it's a part of the expense. Functionally, there is no real difference to any patron between a $20 meal with a 20% tip and a $24 meal. I live in NYC, I'm tipping 20% on all sit down meals. \n\n\nThat being said, most people don't tip at places like self serve fro-yo, or throw $1-$2 in the tip jar. I'm really surprised you got a comment there.", "NTA. The tipping culture in America (as a non-American) sounds so absurd! But it\u2019s not tourists fault that the companies doesn\u2019t pay enough to their workers and forces some workers to relay on tips. The whole \u201cif you can\u2019t afford to tip then don\u2019t go out\u201d doesn\u2019t even make sense to me. Giving tip isn\u2019t mandatory and I think you giving them any tip was very polite. I totally understand that traveling to abroad isn\u2019t cheap at all and I\u2019m sorry your holiday got ruined by this :(", "Yta.  Tipping culture in the US is well known.  You should have factored this into your budget.  You chose one of the most expensive US cities to vacation.  Cheating out on tips so you can afford to visit an expensive city is tacky and rude.  I lived in Southeast Asia for several years.  I have travelled all over the world.  I would never behave as you did in another country.  Respect the country and culture you are visiting.", "I guess you are the AH because you could have looked up this information. But everyone who acted rude because of your tip is also an AH.", "Esh. Obviously people shouldn\u2019t be rude and should be paid a living wage (also not tipping for ice cream is not weird) but you should\u2019ve researched this. When you go to a sit down restaurant you should be tipping around 20%. \n\nWhen I went to Italy, a lot of people had their hand out for tips too. I know it\u2019s hard but you might consider saving up more before going on vacation next time instead of acting like the culture is personally victimizing you", "Id say you are definitely NTA, and I'm sorry you had such uncomfortable interactions.", "\n\nMy dude. YTA majorly. The first rule of tourism is learning and RESPECTING the culture of the place you are visiting. Yes our tipping culture is problematic, but you\u2019re not solving that by being stingy. Most tipped workers are not out buying jet skis and diamonds with their tips, they are feeding and housing their families, and often struggle to do so when people like you stiff them on tips. It is beyond rude to travel to a country and not educate yourself on its customs beforehand - this includes learning that 20% is the standard tip in restaurants. To come here and not follow the culture just because you think you know better is the type of shitty behavior I would expect from entitled Americans abroad (who also need to do better).", "I'm going to go for NTA because of your funds. You saved an entire year's worth of wages and a 10% tip is a full day's wage. You tried to tip where you could, but being on a budget is being on a budget. \n\nIf you had to take inflation into account and the actual tipping culture of the US (which has changed I think, relying more on tips now than before) you might have never been able to go on this once in a lifetime trip with your parents (considering their age, chances are they might not have been in good health anymoe fo the trip).", "NTA, that really makes me not want to visit the USA.", "NTA: honestly if you saved for a year for this it\u2019s not like the staff is more financially disadvantaged than you. People who talk shit about tipping and don\u2019t even though they can tip are the shitty people. As a poor person in a position that receives tips I\u2019m fine if people who genuinely are struggling to put food on the table or a roof over their heads pay what they can. It\u2019s weird to have people who are way more well off demanding money from people much poorer than them. \n\nAlso some places you mentioned aren\u2019t places most Americans tip either. I really only tip at places that provide sit down service, or some other service like hair or nails. If it\u2019s an ice cream shop then only if I have change. And I worked at an ice cream shop too and we never expected tips it was just a nice bonus. Honesty the tipping on the bus thing sounds ridiculous to me to. I really don\u2019t think most people tip at fro yo and no one gets comments about it for not tipping - that\u2019s absurd - I\u2019ll come back to that. \n\nAnd 10% is not that bad. I usually do 10% as my average and the round up to the next even dollar - bc I\u2019m poor and bad at math. But I also don\u2019t go to fancy places so maybe it depends more where you were at. If I could I\u2019d do 15-20 but I just can\u2019t. No one has ever given me shit. \n\nAlso importantly. You were not in a state where minimum wage is reduced in account of tipping. That\u2019s where it becomes really fucked up not to tip. No American min wage workers are being payed a livable min wage - but likely neither are they in your country. In some states the already abysmal min wage is reduced to something insanely low on the basis that tips make up for the rest. New York isn\u2019t one of those states so they were being payed a min wage that is considered standard even in positions that don\u2019t receive tips. It\u2019s not like they were super screwed over by not getting a tip like they would be in those other states. \n\nHonestly hearing you getting shit for not tipping in so many places I have not tipped - or tipped the same amount as you is shocking to me. It makes me wonder if the verbal comments you got were due to racism and xenophobia rather than simply tipping. It\u2019s very unusual for people to actually say something. And what you described actually is pretty standard tipping culture for low income people.", "YTA. There are plenty of threads on Reddit and the internet in general that explain tipping culture to the place you traveled. \n\n10% is a low tip. 20% is standard in restaurants.", "They were mad at you because they are underpaid and tips are basically what they live from. But that is not your problem, and they shouldnt have treated you so badly for it.\n\n They ask for empathy (which is fine) but they didnt treat you with the same kindness, that's horrible. They are just rude and entitled, someone who isnt entitled wouldn't make a tourist feel so bad about to being able to afford tipping them. \n\nNta", "NTA.", "YTA. An unfortunate consequence of tipping and tax policies in the USA is that there are a lot of hidden costs behind a price tag or a price on a menu. That\u2019s just the way it is, like it or not.

It\u2019s how servers pay their rent. \n\nWages and customs in other countries are irrelevant when that server\u2019s rent is due.\n\nBut you never had to pay a VAT, correct? That\u2019s what you saved that should have gone into tips.", "[deleted]", "NTA, all the Americans in this comment section sound very entitled.

I I'm a NYer and I'll break down my opinion of the tipping.\nTours-no ones ever stopped me or screamed at me for tiping a few dollars. Weird. I'd say 5 a person was my standard a while back. Not sure now\nFro yo, bagles and coffee- I wouldn't tip, tipping culture on everything is crazy though this time  of year I and many other people tip more if they can afford it over the holidays.\nRestaurant 18%-20% is standard and 10% is considered a bad tip but morst wait staff wouldn'tsay anything.  When I was growing up it was 15%. The waiter didn't take into account your salary and doesn't know your financial circumstances. Some of the richest people leave the worst tips.\n\nDon't be so hard on yourself but now you know for your next trip here. Cone back, were usually nicer.\n\nEdit spelling, grammer", "NTA\n\nTipping culture is based on the understanding that you can afford these tips based on your pay. You're not getting paid like americans, so how can you justify giving a day's pay to produce a tip? It doesn't make sense. You don't have the same kind of wage as many americans, so the expectations are different. Also tips are voluntary so you shouldn't be treated so horribly about it. I don't agree that you need to save up more to afford a nice trip. You paid what was asked and tried your best. It's not your fault there's an awful tipping culture. It's not the workers' fault either. But they take the job knowing tips are optional. If they don't like it, then they should do something about it. There are lots of minimum wage jobs about, like cleaning etc, which guarantee a minimum wage. They just prefer service work as a lot of the time, tips are very profitable in high tourist areas.\n\nI'm sorry you had such an awful experience.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't mean fast food joints ofc.

Lmfao", ">what exactly is done with the money if not used for wages?\n\nthe owners keep the money.\n\nthe US has extremely lax worker protection laws, so most business owners pay their employees as little as they can get away with. the minimum wage in restaurants is $2.83 per hour, i think. and those employees pay their own health insurance as well, so many of them cannot afford a place to live on their own.\n\ni'm generalizing, because the US is a huge place with a lot of local differences, but it is true that many or most of our wage workers are close to poverty.\n\nand you don't sound rude at all, please don't worry about that!", "Yeah I definitely agree with your polite behavior comment!! It\u2019s super rude in some countries to ask for salt/pepper to season your food (offends the chef), give a thumbs up sign (offensive in certain cultures), etc. Flubs happen, but they can be greatly reduced with a few quick google searches.", "it's not about what you're used to, or what you can afford, it's about following the local customs. it is rude to decide you're not willing to follow the basic culture of the place you're visiting.\n\nOP said that they come from a non-tipping culture and researched American tipping culture before they came. they knew what was culturally expected and decided that they didn't have to do that, because it was a special trip for them. expecting an price cut because you didn't budget for the full cost of a meal is also very rude.\n\ni doubt that OP would go to a restaurant in their own country, eat the meal, only pay 80% of the bill, and say \"well, I couldn't afford the full amount.\" this is the same situation.", "Yeah, I always heard 10-15% is good. A lot of servers and Door Dashers I\u2019ve met actually say that a lot of people don\u2019t tip at all. \n\nBut idk. Maybe it\u2019s regional.", "I just went through a self serve car wash and the machine asked if I wanted to leave a tip. Couldn't believe my eyes.", "I wish that too, but in the meantime I'm not going to be a jerk and not tip the person who is serving me.", "As a Canadian, let me assure you that it\u2019s just as absurd in Canada. Sorry, I am not tipping at self-serving places. Or for someone to pour me a drip coffee and grab me a bagel, no. Or for takeaway, get outta here."]}
