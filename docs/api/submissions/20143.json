For communication with a person, don't be subtle, ever. Say what you mean.  Mean what you say.  Be direct.  Be clear.  Be honest.\n\nYou made an effort to be very direct but your ex friend is either dense AF and didn't \"get it\" initially or is an ahole who would have ignored you regardless.  Had you been more direct later instead of being subtle, there could have been no debate in this by anyone on any level: you had communicated a reasonable boundary multiple times with the penalty of ignoring that boundary clearly stated and heard.\n\nNTA, no debate in my mind but don't be subtle.", "NTA its your day she shouldnt take that away from you", "It seems to me like a wedding can define a friendship. I remember my best friend who is in my wedding party and my mom gave her money to buy it expensive pair of shoes like the other bridesmaids so they would all be dyed together and be the same color.

I would also be upset that she did it after you told her not to do it.", "NTA you specifically told her no one else should wear white, your other friends tried to find other options, and then she lied to you and said she bought it for another event.  She wore that intentionally, and that's just so rude and weird.  \n\nIf this is a friend you love and care about, cutting her off completely seems a bit much, you should at least try to talk about it again, but if the friendship is not that important to you, no need to try to salvage it.", "You don't need any reason to stop talking to anybody whenever yiu want.
