Kenzie is the result of an affair between me and her dad, who was also married with kids. My ex and I divorced when I was pregnant but Kenzie's dad and his wife stayed together.\n\nWhen Kenzie was born I gave her dad full custody and only visited for the first couple years. When she was almost 3 I got married again, we moved into a bigger house, and my new husband wanted Kenzie to start staying over and get to know him and her siblings so we had her stay with us every other weekend. The problem is she's very spoiled and everything I do she insists her mommy could do it better.\n\nShe was here on Saturday. Kenzie is a very picky eater, mostly because she has always refused to give Kenzie frozen food, fast food, and most packaged food. Because of this, she always sends Kenzie with a little cooler with her meals for the weekend and instructions on how to store/prepare/reheat everything but we were just hit with a crazy storm and their power and cell service was out so she was not able to cook for Kenzie and we weren't able to call her. \n\nShe refused to eat what the rest of us were having and made my husband take her grocery shopping to get her own snacks and ingredients for meals. We were going to watch a movie while the younger two were napping but Kenzie got upset because the movie my older two picked was pg13 and she's not allowed to watch those. Then she got upset that I didn't take her to the park and said her mommy would've. Then she wanted me to take her to ride her bike and was upset that I didn't do that either because her mommy would've taken her. Bedtime was the worst. She usually takes a shower, plugs in her white noise machine/nightlight, and facetimes her stepmom so her stepmom could read to her until she falls asleep but since she couldn't call, she wanted me to do her whole bedtime routine including bubble bath, braiding her hair, reading bedtime stories, and rubbing her back until she falls asleep. I said no because I don't have time for all of that and she started crying so I packed her bag and drove her back to her house.\n\nWhen I told her stepmom what happened she gave me a look but took Kenzie in for bed and asked me to wait in the living room. She made me wait for over an hour while she put Kenzie to bed then when she came downstairs she apologized for not packing Kenzie's meals and offered to drop her off the next morning with some easy recipes but I said no, just keep her until she learns not to judge or criticize everything I do. She apologized for Kenzie's behavior and walked me out.\n\nI told my husband about it and he was furious that I told Kenzie's stepmom to keep her and is accusing me of abandoning my kid. He's acting like I'm a terrible mom and is now planning a weekend vacation next weekend with him, the kids, and Kenzie.

A child you willingly gave up full custody of?\n\nOf course it\u2019s work to deal with her and build some semblance of decent relationship. It should be. If she\u2019s \u201cspoiled,\u201d you can know it happened in your absence from her life. Maybe it was to compensate for the fact that the beginning of her life occurred in a shroud of negativity.\n\nStraight up, it doesn\u2019t sound like you love her. If you do, then it\u2019s at least plain you don\u2019t like her at all. And you resent her. Her father, your Affair Partner, choosing not to leave his marriage is not your daughter\u2019s fault. Her mother being good to her instead of some wicked, angry woman is not this little girl\u2019s fault. Now she gets jerked back to a household where her biological mom doesn\u2019t really like her, and she complains. I wonder why.\n\nAt least your current husband seems to care about Kenzie feeling like she belongs in your family. He\u2019s doing at least some of the emotional work you should be doing.\n\nOr if you want to get real with yourself, stop trying to see Kenzie if this is the way you\u2019re going to deal with her. She can be happy with her dad and mom.", "YTA. \n\nShe treats you like a stranger because you are. You didn\u2019t even make the choice to get to know her, your husband did. She even lowballed it for you by telling you what her needs were and you refused. Even with bedtime which is CRUCIAL. YTA. And frankly, you don\u2019t deserve your kid. At 7, she\u2019s just now learning how relationships work. She\u2019s not comparing you to her stepmom. She\u2019s comparing the treatment she is receiving. You are being neglectful and passive. You\u2019d do well to reflect and get some therapy before you lose your kid forever.", "YTA - guilting a 7 year old? Also that's not her step mom. That's her mom. She raised her, not you.", "Holy shit. So you basically abandoned her when she was born and the only reason you\u2019re spending any time with her now is bc your new husband told you to? Thank god Kenzie has a decent mother to feed her healthy food and act like a loving parent. Gargantuan YTA and a bad person. I hope your husband divorces you.", "YTA, do you even like your own child?\n\nShe is seven, and it sounds like she isn't comfortable with you or in your home.  You need to reflect on why that is. \n\nIf the only reason you are having her stay over is because your husband  thinks you should,  then stop. Stop right now and let your child thrive with people who actually care for her.", "YTA. You dipped out on being a real mom, and now you expect her to act as if you are her primary caregiver, when she is being raised by another woman. It sounds like you have resentment issues against both your daughter and her mom that you need to workout yourself because you\u2019re the cause of those issues. Good on Kenzie for refusing to watch a movie that she isn\u2019t allowed to watch (following her parents\u2019 rules), and it was a d*ck move for you to let your other kids pick out a movie that you knew or should have known to not watch (by doing so, you\u2019re basically signaling to Kenzie that you don\u2019t want to include her on family activities). Either learn to adjust to the rules that she is being raised with, go to family therapy with her parents to work out the obvious issues, or acknowledge that you will never be more than just a bio-mom to the girl and let her real mom who took on the burden of raising her adopt the poor girl.", "YTA. \n\nDid you seriously state that you don't have time to braid your child's hair? Or give her any parenting at all? And your complaint is that she wants nutritious food and not frozen or packaged meals? Not only is Kenzie a concern, there are some definite concerns over how you treat the rest of the kids based on this post. \n\nYou abandoned this kid at birth and only take her now because your husband insists. Your husband is awesome and hopefully he gets to continue to see Kenzie and gets full custody of the kids after the inevitable divorce.", "Wow YTA. You dropped her off as a baby and didn't come back until your new husband wanted to make a family and you're surprised she's not used to you? Everything you listed in your post was you whining about your child's needs and telling her variations of you don't have time for her.\n\nYour poor decisions and lack of caring for your child are oozing between the lines of your post. YTA.", "You abandoned your child to her father at birth. Her stepmother stepped up and filled the role of loving mother (and massive respect to her for doing so with a child who was created during her husband's affair with you). You only got involved with your daughter at your new husband's assistance. You don't sound like you have any interest in being this child's mother. You sound like you have an interest in putting yourself in a good light with your new husband. \n\nNewsflash: Being a parent is hard. Successful co-parentng is even harder. Stop trying to have a relationship with this little girl for your new husband's benefit. It's only harming your child. When you are a loving parent and things get difficult (or, in your case, mildly inconvenient), you persevere. You don't drop your child back with their other parent and remind her what it felt like to be abandoned the first time. \n\nMake up your damn mind. Do you want to be a mother to her? If so, put in the effort and find a way to balance what your child is used to with what you are able to provide. If not, then cut it off and leave her to be raised by the people who are willing to do the work. You don't get to pop in and out when it suits you. Your daughter is only seven. Things aren't going to get easier from here. Stop inflicting trauma on this poor little girl. Either shut up and saddle up, or ride your ass off into the sunset. \n\nYTA in so many ways", "YTA - is there someone else in this scenario even eligible to be TA? Do you want this child in your life?

It\u2019s pretty obvious you don\u2019t actually love or like this child. You also seem pretty salty she grew up they way she did.  How is she spoiled? She has a routine, that\u2019s not spoiling a child. The fact you gave her dad full contact shows you had no intention on actually caring for her you actually seem mad that your marriage ended and her dads didn\u2019t, he\u2019ll it looks like you blame her. I\u2019m happy she has someone who loves her so much despite how she was brought in to this world.

She\u2019s already going to grow up knowing that she was an accident and the result of an affair. Then you completely ignore her and punish her by abandoning her???? \n\nYTA. A huge one.", "Jesus Christ lady. YTA for many reasons. But very VERY much an AH for the reason you asked about. You absolutely abandoned your daughter, twice as a matter of fact. You are seriously mad at a 7 year old because you refused to be a mom. All those things Kenzie asked you to do with her? That's normal parent stuff, which you would know if you weren't such a horrible parent. Her stepmother sounds like a Saint. She's raising YOUR daughter for you because you refused to.", "YTA. What the heck. Your husband sounds like a good man but he's married to you so I question that. I hope they go on the trip without you. You sound horrible with your own daughter. From the time that Kenzie was born you made the choice to give her Father full custody. It sounds like you don't even know your daughter or care to even know her. You can't be bothered.", "YTA. \nThis saint of a woman took in your child, the child of her husband\u2019s infidelity, and treats her like her own. To the point that she wants her MOTHER (not step mom let\u2019s be real that\u2019s her mommy) to read her books every night. \n\nYou didn\u2019t want this child, which is your right. However, you\u2019ve interrupted her happy home because your new husband said you should. Do what is right and sign over all rights to her MOTHER and disappear. Make sure she has all your health info and skedaddle.", "Info: Do you even want a relationship with her? Serious inquiry. It does not seem like you put in any effort AT ALL!!\n\nEdit to add YTA", "Wow.  YTA.  But your husband is wrong.  He should just let you abandon that poor child.  You don't even like her or have time for her.  The only reason she's been pulled back into your life is because of your husband.  Leave her alone and let her heal and get on with her life.", "YTA. Let her step mom adopt her. Its painfully obvious you don't like her, much less love her. No time to give a kid you only see a few days a month a bath & braid her hair? That is such a shame. Just stay out of her life. She deserves better.", "Are you being serious right now? YTA", "YTA.. She is only 7, it wouldn't have killed you to take the time to make sure she went to sleep happy, and as for the food thing, if she is hungry enough she will eat what you made.  You are the adult and you acted like a child by taking her back instead of trying to adjust.  You have zero chance of having a relationship with this child when she get older.  Hope you are proud of yourself.", "YTA\n\nIt's very clear you do not love or care for this child and you do not want her in your life. But you let your husband talk you into reluctantly bringing her home for a weekend and you treated her horribly. She is SEVEN! She is used to certain routines and it would not have killed you to do your best.\n\nAnd that woman is not her \"stepmom\"; that's her mom. You can barely be called that.", "YTA\n\nFirst up its not her stepmom,  this woman is her mother who has clearly done everything to raise a good child. You are literally just the biological parent. \n\nI get that the child appears to have a routine that isn't ideal for you but this is your opportunity to bond with her. \n\nOnce you have done that you could slowly create your own little routine together but you 'don't have time for that'.\n\nI suspect you only agreed to get to know her so your husband doesn't mark you as the awful human that you are but awful humans have a way of showing themselves as you have here. If you have any semblance of humanity you would do one of two things. Either do the right thing and slowly find a way to create a new routine when she's with you or stop being in her life so that you don't cause further abandonment issues for her. \n\nTo be perfectly clear YTA", "YTA. Please tell me this isn't real. You are mad at a 7 year old for following the rules and living her life the way she has lived all this while when you were absent? She isn't criticising you but is finding it incredibly difficult to adjust when you aren't cooperating. \n\n>I said no because I don't have time for all of that\n\nYou don't have time to spend with your own child and have the audacity to take offence when she talks about the people who have raised her and care for her daily. Wow. \n\n>the kids, and Kenzie\nI am sorry, is Kenzie not your kid?", "So she\u2019s only there because your husband asked for here there? Do you want here there? Do you want a relationship with your daughter? If so, you\u2019re doing a really crappy job of it.\n\nI get the food thing because kids can be picky eaters. Then when she asked to do very normal kid things movie, park, bike riding, bed routine she was flat out told no. It seems like since you already see her as spoiled brat you don\u2019t want to compromise. Guess what? You could have helped avoid this by have being an active parent in her life earlier. Now that another woman has stepped up and done these motherly things for her, your upset. You have the nerve.\n\nYou are 100% TAH.", "YTA. Kenzie is having a hard time adjusting and you just proved you cannot be trusted by abandoning her again. Also, picking a movie she can watch is inclusive. Instead you separated her. Lots of people have bedtime routines and special diets. She\u2019s 7 and away from home. You needed to go out of your way to make her comfortable and accepted. Geese.", "YTA \n\nYou are a terrible mom to her. Full stop. \nProps to the step mom who took in her partners affair child and loves her more than you obviously ever have.", "YTA. You seriously typed all that out and think you're not the AH? You sound like you're jealous and resentful that Kenzie is having a decent upbringing and it's not a good look. She's 7 and you're a whole ass adult who's salty over someone raising your child better than you.", "\"She was here on Saturday.

So first of all, she's 7. That's pretty normal behavior for a 7 year old. Second of all, I'm pretty sure she was testing you by saying that stuff. That's something that kids that go between homes do, and you definitely failed her \"test\" by just sending her back. You're an adult, there's more mature ways to deal with this situation. Like, I don't know, actually parenting her???", "YTA. She\u2019s 7. **7**! \n\nShe has a clear routine with her dad and step mom and it\u2019s going to take time for her to adjust when things are different from that (especially when it\u2019s unexpected like this instance of the power going out). It\u2019s also going to take time for you to build that relationship with her. She gave you several opportunities to *bond* with her and you just dismissed her. You haven\u2019t been in her life and if you want to have a relationship with her that means making the effort to forge a connection.", "YTA. She is your child and you are an adult. Act like one! There are solutions to parenting other than throwing up your hands and saying: \"I can't deal with this - somebody else fix it!\" Your response literally made the issues much worse than they were. Plus, why are you not parenting her? If all the kids were all planning to watch a movie, why did you allow the older ones to pick one your younger daughter couldn't watch? When she first started coming to your home, why didn't you explain to her AND her parents what your rules were, rather than go along with coolers of food and now her demands to be taken shopping for special foods? Seriously OP, grow up!", "What the fuck man. YTA.", "YTA. It sounds like you don\u2019t really want a relationship with her. I mean you\u2019re not even willing to go through her bedtime routine\u2026 pushing for a relationship with her when you don\u2019t actually want one will hurt her.

Do the poor kid a favour and stop \u201ctrying\u201d.", "YTA - you weren\u2019t a mother and now you expect your kid to respect you. Why would she listen to you? Why would she even want to be in your home?", "YTA.\nThis is a child. A tiny child. Even if you don't agree with the way her stepmom's raising her, it's contingent on you to be kind.", "YTA. Please stop having kids.", "Yta, you created this situation", "That little girl is lucky her stepmom is apparently an Angel dropped from heaven.

I applaud him for wanting to make an effort, but I don't know what he was thinking with you.\n\nYou sound so mad that she's not clamoring to be with you and holds onto the life she has at her dad's. Guess what, her step mother has treated her better than you (a rarity on reddit).\n\nYour husband is right in that you're a terrible mother. Can you read anything of what you wrote with some self reflection?

Kenzie is the result of an affair between me and her dad, who was also married with kids. My ex and I divorced when I was pregnant but Kenzie's dad and his wife stayed together.\n\nWhen Kenzie was born I gave her dad full custody and only visited for the first couple years. When she was almost 3 I got married again, we moved into a bigger house, and my new husband wanted Kenzie to start staying over and get to know him and her siblings so we had her stay with us every other weekend. The problem is she's very spoiled and everything I do she insists her mommy could do it better.\n\nShe was here on Saturday. Kenzie is a very picky eater, mostly because she has always refused to give Kenzie frozen food, fast food, and most packaged food. Because of this, she always sends Kenzie with a little cooler with her meals for the weekend and instructions on how to store/prepare/reheat everything but we were just hit with a crazy storm and their power and cell service was out so she was not able to cook for Kenzie and we weren't able to call her. \n\nShe refused to eat what the rest of us were having and made my husband take her grocery shopping to get her own snacks and ingredients for meals. We were going to watch a movie while the younger two were napping but Kenzie got upset because the movie my older two picked was pg13 and she's not allowed to watch those. Then she got upset that I didn't take her to the park and said her mommy would've. Then she wanted me to take her to ride her bike and was upset that I didn't do that either because her mommy would've taken her. Bedtime was the worst. She usually takes a shower, plugs in her white noise machine/nightlight, and facetimes her stepmom so her stepmom could read to her until she falls asleep but since she couldn't call, she wanted me to do her whole bedtime routine including bubble bath, braiding her hair, reading bedtime stories, and rubbing her back until she falls asleep. I said no because I don't have time for all of that and she started crying so I packed her bag and drove her back to her house.\n\nWhen I told her stepmom what happened she gave me a look but took Kenzie in for bed and asked me to wait in the living room. She made me wait for over an hour while she put Kenzie to bed then when she came downstairs she apologized for not packing Kenzie's meals and offered to drop her off the next morning with some easy recipes but I said no, just keep her until she learns not to judge or criticize everything I do. She apologized for Kenzie's behavior and walked me out.\n\nI told my husband about it and he was furious that I told Kenzie's stepmom to keep her and is accusing me of abandoning my kid. He's acting like I'm a terrible mom and is now planning a weekend vacation next weekend with him, the kids, and Kenzie. AITA for driving her back?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I personally also wouldn't have let her call stepmom for bedtime stories while she's with you, but that's me. But now she knows that all she has to do is complain and she gets to go back to her dad's.

You wrote all that out and are still wondering if YTA?\n\nIt\u2019s obvious to everyone here that you only have her over to appease your current husband, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s even more obvious to him and her mom and dad. \n\nYou seem to deeply resent this child and rather than deal with your issues, you\u2019re taking it out on her. You need therapy, especially if you\u2019re going to stay in her life. YTA.", "She\u2019s 7, the movie might have content that she isn\u2019t comfortable with. Especially if she hasn\u2019t been exposed to it before. Believe it or not, not all kids are eager to jump into more mature stuff at that age.", "You are alarmingly and coldly detached from your daughter, but I guess that's to be expected considering you abandoned her immediately after giving birth to her.", "By different you mean where her siblings get to eat what they want, watch what they want and do what they want while she gets ignored and told no to any suggestion of spending time with you.\n\nDo you even like Kenzie? Seriously, why are you in her life?", "Ya know? I think Kenzie would be a lot better off if you just left her life again. You don\u2019t seem to add anything of value, and she already has a great mom.", "That may not be a problem for you for too much longer because I sincerely hope that Kenzie's mom and dad take you back to court and get your visitation rights terminated. You don't want Kenzie, your new husband does.", "Oh I think she's learned that alright. YTA, and a host of other choice descriptors that would get me banned from this sub.", "I mean, you obviously don't care about this kid, so what's stopping you from just walking out of her life altogether?", "Why in the world would you not try to make her comfortable when she is there for a visit? She should feel welcomed and loved, not made to feel like a disturbance to your normal lifestyle/routine.", "you don't want a relationship with Kenzie, your husband does.  Is this how you feel about the rest of your children?  Is it just performative?  I don't understand why anyone who dislikes children so much would have so many of them.", "She did. She learned she can stay with her Mom & Dad, ir she can stay with some nasty rude adult who couldn't cate less about her. \n\nYour husband sounds like a nice guy. Wonder how long he's going to put up with you before finding a good mom and partner?", "you know Kenzie is allowed to have wants to right? They do not disappear", "YTA\n\nWait until Kenzie learns she can go no contact when she\u2019s an adult", "She can learn that you're lazy, don't know how to cook a fresh meal. Or wont for her. \n\nAnd that you don't love her.", "Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to learn that it might be different, but compromises can be made to accommodate her since she has to accommodate for a lot considering here circumstances with parents?", "You don't want her around, so you make her be forced to adapt so you don't have to blame yourself when she stops coming. Nice plan, your husband hates it.", "Christ on a cracker, you SUCK!!", "Christ on a cracker, you SUCK!!", "Oh, one hundred percent. In my original comment I said as much the same.\n\nShe gave up her child to her affair partner and his wife, and shock to the system - AP\u2019s wife turns out to be a loving, doting, caring person and parent to a child who has done nothing to deserve hate or resentment. Meanwhile, child\u2019s biological mother has no interest until her also apparently decent new husband wants to include this innocent child in both sides of her family.\n\nOP is angry this kid exists, angry the kid broke up her first marriage but didn\u2019t get her what she wanted (affair partner), and is mad the mom she gave her kid up to loves her child in spite of her husband\u2019s infidelity. And now she hates that the kid has a happy life and isn\u2019t handling being jerked around to her resentful bio mom\u2019s house.\n\nBio mom doesn\u2019t care about her stress or her comfort. In her shoes I would also be counting down the minutes until I could go home.", "I\u2019m dying to know how old OP is.", "Because her new husband wanted Kenzie to get to know him and her \"siblings\". She doesn't want Kenzie and she is an inconvenience to OP. She needs to sign away her rights and leave her alone.", "What the siblings want to do and eat is easy, I doubt if they wanted the same as Kenzie they would be getting it.", "What are you thinking?", "We don\u2019t even know what it is that Kenzie wants, just that it\u2019s not fast food or junk. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s complicated or time consuming \n\nIf OP gave even a tiny crap about Kenzie, OP would keep food in the house that she likes for the weekends she visits", "You're right, I'm assuming and I'm absolutley not saying that she cares about her kid. My kid doesn't eat processed foods or fast food and that usually means more effort for an actual meal. My first thought was that she should stay out of her life unless Kenzie wants to see her."]}
