That struck me as odd, and suggests he already had a problem with Pete marrying his daughter. Then, the fact that their assumptions about what Pete did were so bad, tells me he has likely behaved certain ways prior to this; that they have worked out. Then the fact that they are not on speaking terms after these events says there might be more history of conflict here than you even know. \n\nYou are in absolutely no way at fault here. Pete is the only AH here, and I hope your sister comes to her senses. \n\nI also hope your step-dad finds a way to bridge their fallout.

Since it was agreed he would pay for the wedding; reneging is just wrong and quite frankly, childish!

So for that reason I think it\u2019s important to not minimize her pain or anything like that, but in the long run nobody deserves treatment like that from the person they\u2019re going to marry. And breakups are AWFUL. Especially when she wants to go ahead and marry this man. And maybe she will on their own dime.

Might be worth having a convo with her as to why she feels like you\u2019ve affected her past relationships. But also if she continues on with this guy PLEASE do not let her think that she\u2019s lost EVERYONES support, even if it\u2019s just you, bc if she feels judged continuing on with him, it will be very easy for Pete to isolate her, and harder for her to leave if she finally realizes she should.", "Save your sympathy for the victims.", "What difference would it make to Pete in this situation if they were bio sisters?", "She is determined to ruin her life by marrying creepy cheater.

I agreed, because I didn't feel I had any right to continue being a spanner in the works. \n\nOP, how have you sabatoged her relationships in the past?", "INFO: what did you mean about her getting upset about you sabotaging all of her relationships? What\u2019s the history there? Curious because this may expand on her hyper focus on being angry towards you.", "YOU didn\u2019t cause the wedding to be cancelled. The GROOM did that by propositioning you!! \n\nThe fault lies with him. Not you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, look, I\u2019ve found out in my 55 years in this planet, you need to tell the truth, people won\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s going to sting at first, but that will blow over eventually and people will get over it, don\u2019t carry someone else\u2019s burden", "I love the victim blame here. OP is obviously grossed out by Pete's behavior and upset he was so nasty. If he didn't have a reputation then Step-dad wouldn't have thought what he did seeing Pete go outside. It's telling SD automatically worried when this cad was alone with his Step daughter. What reasonable person thinks that without reason?", "NTA OP!  Look at it this way; your stepdad works with Pete, presumably knows him somewhat well... at least in the context of how he is within the company... and his immediate reaction was to jump to worst case scenario.  That is very telling for what kind of a guy Pete is.\n\nYour stepsister may be pissed right now, but hopefully in the long run she'll see you've done her a solid.  And she needs new friends if they're going to tell women who've been approached inappropriately by her fianc\u00e9 to just shut up and deal with it.", "My initial thought was similar.  However, I'm stuck on the \"I'd already done enough to sabotage her relationships\" comment.  Makes me wonder what OP has done and not shared...", "Sleazy AND dumb. What a catch.", "You make a valid point. Someone cannot order you to not talk about something that happened\u2026 to you. \n\nYou were there, you had every right to tell anybody you would like, right from the beginning, if you had wanted to. \n\nAnd you handled this with MUCH grace, OP.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "Yep! Is there a history with OP and the step sisters boyfriends??", "If the parents were thinking way worse case scenarios, the dad would have probably refused to pay for the wedding anyway.", "Yes, an awful situation for Jen. Imagine having to come to terms with the idea that not only are you with a cheater, but your partner wants to cheat with your step-sister and you\u2019ve basically been used by him to stay close to her.\n\nTo think that your whole relationship is based on a lie is just brutal. I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s still in denial about what is happening and is blaming everyone else. I hope she is getting some professional help and support - this is just a crushing thing to experience. \n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not your job to cover for Pete\u2019s mistakes. Your stepsister and friends should be mad at Pete for propositioning you and almost cheating on your step sister vs. you being honest about his behavior.", "I didn't catch that s. I originally read that as Jen blaming OP for Pete liking her but you have a point about the relationships!", "Relationship with her parents, I presume. There's likely some resentment about the money", "Could you please explain the jealousy bit? I don\u2019t understand why OP would when she\u2019s already married and technically could have had Pete in the first place. It could be a big possibility that OP couldn\u2019t fit all the details in because of word limit.", "This is a great take", "I don't completely agree with this! I was in this position with my sister's husband & because of his actions I had to put a lot of distance between my family & me. It is terrible to think you have to deal with his inappropriate behavior in order to see your family. I am honestly glad that he is now dead because I can now visit family.", "It\u2019s odd in that instance too because she\u2019s not the one sabotaging anything here. At least, not by her account. I could see why Jen might see it that way (even though she\u2019s blaming the wrong person, as it appears). She kept her distance when she heard of the crush and didn\u2019t engage. When he propositioned her she turned him down. What does the sister mean by sabotage, and in the plural, past tense? \ud83e\udd14", "Yeah but by that point she hadn\u2019t told them anything. She was asking her not to because she\u2019s apparently ruined relationships in the past.", "Unless it\u2019s involving stalking/restraining orders exc.\nOr it doesn\u2019t even have to be a specific official criminal record.\n\nMaybe he\u2019s had multiple complaints from other women at work or at other places of employment.\n\nAnd you could I suppose make the argument if they\u2019ll be dishonest legally when it could have real legal ramifications then why would they be any more ethical in other aspects of their life. *note: I don\u2019t necessarily believe that but I can follow the logic there.*\n\nRegardless NTA: your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 made a move on you. You told her and she accused you of ruining her relationship (which is sad and irritatedly sexist).\n\nYou didn\u2019t set out to tattle to your parents but you can\u2019t always cover your reactions and you shouldn\u2019t have to: guy is a sexist creep (on that vain maybe sister is actually a perfect match).\n\nLook you can\u2019t control your step sisters actions, neither can your parents. If she\u2019s gonna marry him she\u2019s gonna marry him but letting her know was the right thing to do. \n\nYour parents asked you flat out, saw him following you and all their thoughts were even worse than what actually happened. \n\nYour stepsister just doesn\u2019t want to face facts. Honestly it sounds like the main reason he\u2019s with her is to get a shot at/as a substitute for you.\n\nYour stepsister is being a doormat and will let this man get away with anything- nothing he does will ever be his fault. It will always be the fault of the other woman. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, try not to dwell on it. If she wants you ruin her life that\u2019s her choice", "I wonder if Jen was mad OP worked at the dad's company and why OP ultimately quit. I think I'm so weirded out by the idea Jen decided to date and get engaged to a dude that is that seriously into and still into her step sister that I was wondering if Jen saw it as some haha I stole him in her mind that I'm suspicious of Jen over OP. I know I'm reaching here but I can't fathom doing that. \n\nOr maybe it's relationships plural because it's Pete and Jen's dad. OP \"made\" both of those relationships harder by existing?", "Nah, I don\u2019t think so, because at that point she hadn\u2019t told the dad anything.\n\nIt\u2019s also strange that when the dad found out, he got angry and called Jen, not Pete. Why would he call Jen? Pete is the guilty party here. Jen and OP are innocent in all of this, apparently.\n\nThere\u2019s things we aren\u2019t being told, I feel.\n\nAlso I think Jen is an idiot for getting engaged to a coworker. I know you can\u2019t help you you fall for but you absolutely can help who you date before it gets to that point.", "As someone who still regularly pirates movies, I always found those ads hilarious. \n\nOn a more serious note, I think stealing a wife or partner is probably the only type of stealing that isn't an actual crime in most countries. I find it extra reprehensible since my so-called friend and my ex-wife cheated. I obviously have a very strong dislike for him years later, but even then I would never try claim he was a criminal or, worse, destined to abuse their children like the other nonsense comment did.", "And she & her kid move back with mom & dad. But you'll still be the one she blames.", "Why on earth (oh dear lord) would someone who never had any chance finally get a chance if they marry a relative or a friend? \n\nNot even patriarchy can explain such a stupid move\n\nOP s sister is desperate enough to get married to a man who has a crash on someone else\n\nWhat did she mean though by saying that OP sabotages her relationships?", "More like Yeet Pete Yeet!", "I'm sure there are other things being left out. \n\nI didn't think that part was strange, OP probably told them that Jen knew and told OP not to tell them. If I was the parents, I would have said I'm not talking to Pete again and called my daughter to tell her I'm not paying for her to marry a man that did that to my step daughter. The second Jen told OP not to tell anyone, I think Jen stopped being an innocent party.", "I completely agree!", "Step-dad owns the company, Pete is trying to marry his way to the top.", "\n\nGo point. OP what did it mean when Jen said you sabotage all her relationships? \n\n>Why on earth (oh dear lord) would someone who never had any chance would finally get a chance if they marry a relative or a friend? \n\n>Not even patriarchy can explain such a stupid move\n\nWho knows?? When my cousins boyfriend did it to her I asked the same question and never got a answer"]}
