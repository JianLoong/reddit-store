If your step sister wants to throw away her own family to be left with a husband who would try to fuck her step sister a week before they got married, thats a her problem.

The confirmation Pete would step out on your stepsister resulted in the funds withdrawn for the wedding, but the core issue in that statement is Pete looking to have sex with someone other than his fianc\u00e9e, and worse, with her stepsister.\n\nIt sounds like your stepsister is not interested in holding him accountable for his actions.
