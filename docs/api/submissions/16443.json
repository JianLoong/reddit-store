Recently, my sister had a beautiful daughter and my mum wanted to spend time and help take care of the granddaughter. I decided to help my father take care of my little brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I started to look into his school, I was under the assumption that my brother was just one of those people that just did not do well in school. So, basically what would happen is he would lie to mum and dad on when he had tests and stuff in order to play video games all day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there was an incident where he not tell anyone that he had a test to play games then he got a low score. His report card came out and his HIGHEST mark was a 56/100. Dad was getting frustrated and was telling him that he's wasting his time at school. I defended him the whole time and said maybe there is something WE are doing wrong and we need to change it. when the whole argument ended I sat my brother down, hugged him and told him that I will defend him, but I still agree that something needs to change. We can start by being honest with when there are tests, and move from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gave him a simple set of rules. If he finishes off his work (which i would check when I got home), let me know when he had tests the day he was told (instead of the day before the test), and if he studied for at least an hour a day (if he had a test coming up), I would let him play video games in his free time. If not? Tough, no electronics for the day. And that's basically what he did for the entire term (3 months). The results? 3As, 4Bs, 2Cs and 2 failing test grades (one of which was because he got sick). AND THAT'S WITH LITTLE EFFORT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was (and still am) so proud of him! Clearly he actually does well if he applies himself. But then that got me thinking, why hasn't this been shown till now? I also noticed that my brother would listen to me any time i gave him an instruction or spoke to him, but with my parents he would hesitate or ignore it. Initially I thought he was just getting to that age, but seeing how he is with me, it was just weird that he's so different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I sat down with my parents told them there is clearly an issue. My mum said \"he's just like that\" which just baffled me cause clearly he wasn't. I asked how they disciplined him when he acted out and they said they don't want to discipline him the way they did with me (not going to go into detail, but we're brown). I said that's completely fine, but you need to show him actions have consequences otherwise he'll never listen. They just brushed it off and said I don't know what I'm talking about since I've never had a kid. I said I understand that but I don't need to have a kid to tell you that what is happening is wrong and only hurting my brother. That CLEARLY, even with the bare minimum, my brother benefits immensely. We had an argument and it ended up with them saying I'm the AH for \"trying to teach them to parent\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, AITA?

I don\u2019t know many parents who would accept a straight-up \u201cyou\u2019re wrong about parenting\u201d from one of their own children, but fair play for giving it a go.", "NTA you were being a good brother. Keep being there for him and encouraging him.\n\nYou told him you're proud of him, right?", "NTA \n\nI'm a former teacher and current foster parent. If your folks don't think you know what you're doing then let me give you some back up/explanation for why your methods worked.\n\nA.) Accountability. Just like you said. Kids aren't good at motivating themselves at doing the difficult, complex, boring work when there's fun, easy, engaging work to be done, like playing video games. Their brains literally haven't fully developed the parts that allow them to do this effectively. It's a huge part of our jobs as the trusted adults in a kid's life to provide that accountability. \n\nB.) You turned the issue into a cooperative problem solving experience that the two of you share and are both invested in rather than an oppositional kid versus adult issue. Your dad just expressed frustration and told him to change. He essentially told the kid that he's the problem and that he needs to fix it alone. But how does someone fix a problem that their brain is not developmentally ready to fix? It's like asking an infant to choose the yucky food over the tasty food then getting angry when he doesn't succeed because he just didn't try hard enough. That's exactly why small humans need big humans to guide them. That's exactly why these problems should be solved cooperatively.\n\nC.) Not only did you work with him on his problem, you also advocated for him. You were the only one willing to admit that something that the adults were doing was wrong and needed to change. You stuck by that belief and showed up for him to give him what he needed when others couldn't or wouldn't. That engenders a LOT of trust in kids in a world where most adults rationalize whatever is easiest when it comes to child rearing. \n\nD.) You respected his choices. You didn't denigrate video games. You didn't ban them outright. You respected the fact that that's what he loves and you used that to motivate him. Lots of adults would've removed them entirely.\n\nE.) You kept things simple. You didn't overcomplicate this lesson in accountability, you didn't change the rules midway, and you didn't try to make it about anything else but this issue. The issues at play are already complex and require lots of work on both your parts so keeping it down to a pretty basic formula makes it easier for all concerned. \n\nI think because you're young that you probably, knowingly or not, are utilizing strategies that would've made sense to you at that age. A lot of folks make the mistake of forgetting what it means to be a kid and end up just doing whatever was done to them. But if we can try to remember how we felt and what we thought about the treatment we were given  as children, it becomes pretty clear that we're doing something wrong. Kudos to you for listening, for being patient, and for sticking with it! Your brother has a great role model, and you should feel proud too!\n\nBest of luck to you both!", "NTA. However, I don't think you'll get anywhere with them. As much as it might hurt, if you want him to do well, you might need to act as the parent here, since your parents aren't stepping up to the plate.\n\nThey only get minor AH ratings, because it sounds like they're trying to be good parents to him and do better with him than they feel they did with you. But they're still failing him by not setting any boundaries at all.", "NTA, this is responsible and brotherly of you :)", "NTA.  You're doing your best to help! Your parents seem to be treating him more like a grandson than a son, maybe they don't have the energy to discipline him?  Either way, it would be amazing if you can keep helping him, but I suppose he isn't really your responsibility either.", "NTA. \n\nThe evidence is right there. Your brother does well and showed substantial improvement under your watchful eye. If your parents aren\u2019t going to adopt your methods, your brother needs you to stay involved and help him succeed, if you are willing and able to. You\u2019re an amazing brother (and son) for doing this.\n\nMaybe you can circumvent their pride and defensiveness by recasting it as you mentoring him rather than them failing at parenting him. As you helping him with school and learning good study habits.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're not just coming from a position of ignorance and telling them they suck.

Your brother has shown to respond well to a set of rules and your parents are being neglectful toward him. \nNTA.", "NTA.\nThey are doing more harm than good in the long run.\nBut good on your for being a good brother and looking out for him", "NTA. Not a close call.", "NTA. They're lazy. That's got nothing to do with race.", "NTA OP. I used to work for my local school district, and I have seen many examples of what happens when the parenting style is too lax: the kids don\u2019t appear to want to engage, and their schoolwork suffers.", "....I have no clue how that never crossed my mind. Now I have their perspective in this case. Thanks!", "Bang on here, fingers crossed OP can find a way to get them to come around.", "Absolutely told him! And made sure I kept telling him and reminding him that the better he does, the more I'll continue to remind him.", "I don't think acting as a parent would help, because all I do is treat my brother with respect, tell him where he went wrong and show him how to correct it (for most things at least). I can just work on the discipline aspect. They're good parents. But, like one other person pointed out, they treating my because of the age difference is making them treat my brother like a grandchild more than a child.", "NTA suggestion is to be more involved in your younger brothers life. Your parents may just be too old at this point to keep up with him which is/isn\u2019t really an excuse. But please be there for your little brother InshaAllah time spent with you means more to him than can be expressed.", "NTA, but I get where your parents are coming from.  One of my bonus kids had a mother who immigrated and knew that the beatings she grew up with were wrong.  But she didn\u2019t know what else to do, so she just verbally tried to correct the kid, but never had anything backing it up, so it never landed.  Baby girl ended up being the most oddly spoiled and neglected kid ever!  Not taught to care for herself because mom couldn\u2019t figure out what to do if the kid refused.  Only good at school because kid has this thing about being perfect and she had no tolerance for failure as she always got a yes to make the crying stop.  Keep going, it\u2019s much easier to fix before high school and college.", "Thank you so much for taking the time to respond so well! I appreciate the time taken to write all this. It's great to get the perspective from a teacher and parent! I feel obligated to answer each point here.  \n\n\nAgreed! To be fair I am a gamer myself, but with my parent's help I was able to manage my time with both school and gaming. As someone else pointed out, the reason they spoil him more is because he gets treated more like a grandchild than a child, due to the age gaps.\n\nHonestly? I totally did it all unknowingly. To me it just made sense that \"If you do A you get rewarded, if not, then simply no\" and I think the only difference to it was I actually made it that he didn't get what he wanted when he didn't do the needed tasks. When we started I just used the meme \"you screw around and you find out\" and told him thats basically that's the only rule lol. I never planned on punishing him at all, because I genuinely wouldn't know how to. Just wanted to make sure he understood that, under me, there's a two way system. You do your bit. I'll do mine.", "Circumventing their pride to think differently is a great idea! I actually want to try that. Thank you!", "THIS.  \n\n\n100% they're treating him like a grandchild. Yeah my parents are 59m and 51f respectively, so they're on the old side.  \n\n\nWe all live under one house. Due to nepotism, I was able to grow my fathers business and we all live together. Once I settle down (touch wood, I do), I've already made plans to basically live in the same yard, but build a small house on the side.", "Actually that's how the conversation started.

Thank you so much for the kind words!", "To be fair, they clearly need SOMEONE to teach them to parent.", "Oh hon, that *is* acting as a parent.", "Was your brother unexpected?

Good, night night\" that tends to happen with older parents. \n\nAnd what you did is literally what a parent is supposed to do", "I don't mean you need to do anything different.

It's more to remind them to parent.
