You shouldn\u2019t have disconnected it in the first place.", "THATS NOT MAINTENANCE.", "I'm a maintenance mechanic in a factory. If I ever dare to remove or turn of a safety device, for wathever reason, I'll be fired and prosecuted. \n\nBut hey, I think you are troll anyway.", "So does that mean you'd disconnect the airbag sensors to teach her to wear a seat belt? What the hell is your delusion here?", "That wasn't maintenance, my friend. It was the opposite.", "Maintenance doesn't usually include sabotage.", "Please, educate us on how disconnecting the camera is 'maintenance.' \n\nSpoiler alert: It's basically the opposite of maintenance. It's literally vandalism.
