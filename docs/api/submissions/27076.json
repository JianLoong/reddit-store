The allowance is a smaller amount ($50-$100/week, but always equal for each of us) that gets moved to separate accounts for each of us, with the understanding that we can spend this money on whatever, no permission needed. Usually it's spent on individual hobbies/splurges. This works well for us. \n\n\nToday, I was looking through my husband's credit card bill that I had used recently (with his permission) to make some travel arrangements. We don't keep any secret bills. This credit card is auto-paid from our joint account. I saw a $73 charge to YouTube and asked him about it. He said he didn't remember buying anything, so I dug further. Turns out he had subscribed to YouTube TV last December to watch a football game on a road trip and forgot about it. I had no idea because this was his YouTube account, his email notifications, his credit card. The total charges added up to about $675. \n\n\nI admit I was annoyed and made some short comments. \"You should always set a reminder to cancel these things.\" \"If you responsible about checking your emails, this might not have happened.\" There is a history of him being irresponsible with bills and missing important emails. I manage almost all the finances. We're in good shape, but I hate the idea of waste. We weren't even utilizing that expensive subscription, he paid that money to watch one thing ten months ago. \n\n\nI told him that to be fair he'd have to pay the $675 out of his \"fun money\". He had more than enough in there because he was saving for a bigger hobby purchase. I cancelled the YT subscription on his phone, then used the banking app on my phone to move the money from his allowance account back to the joint account. I probably should've asked him to move the money himself, but I was upset. I felt more calm after doing the $ transfer because to me the matter was then settled. \n\n\nHe got irritated and said he shouldn't have to pay out of his allowance for a simple mistake. I said \"Everyone has to pay for their mistakes. That's how life works.\" Maybe I was harsh. But the wasted money was all on him. I don't see any better way to resolve it. \nHe pointed out that we are doing fine financially, we are fortunate that $675 out of the joint account won't affect our budgeting for the month, but it will make a big difference to his saving for his hobbies as it is close to 2 month's \"allowance.\"\nIt was the principle of the matter to me. I'm very careful with money. No matter how well we do financially, I'll always look for good deals and avoid profligate spending. \n\nSo, AITA for moving my husband's fun/allowance money to pay for a mistake he made?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate the responses, as reading the objective viewpoints helped me realize I behaved badly, more punitive than \"fair.\" Marriage is a partnership, not a balance sheet, and honest mistakes happen. I reacted out of irritation about the money without thinking about the bigger picture. \nI called my husband and apologized. He said he didn't blame me for being irritated, as he was irritated about the money too, but he appreciated the apology. He said we could talk later about moving the money back or not. \n\nThanks again, and feel free to keep weighing in with comments- I feel like healthy debate is the best part of AITA.", "created_utc": 1694974863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l8002/aita_for_making_my_husband_pay_for_a_mistake_out/", "score": 2725, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

God forbid anybody gets in any kind of situation like that with you. \u201cIt\u2019s okay babe it\u2019s just 700$ we can afford that \u2018mistake\u2019, and when I blow 1000$ next time you can just take it out of the joint bank account again, oh and next month when I blow 2000$ we have enough so we are good, and it\u2019s all good because I can still have my fun money and you can enjoy the stress of cleaning up after me.\u201d\n\nYeah that's just not how people work. Would you really date a person who would act maliciously like that? A one-off mistake is a one-off mistake. OP has not described a pattern of behavior.\n\nYou're really fucking mad about this lol.", "It's not an equal and fair system. An 'allowance system' is bullshit in the first place. Just calling it that reeks of business level BDSM shit.\n\nPeople make mistakes. Yeah, they make 700$ ones too. You know zero about their actual income.

I'm saying that IF we are asserting that it's okay for her to make unilateral financial decisions regarding \"punishment\" based on the claim that it is her chosen responsibility to take care of finances, THEN we must assume that it is also her responsibility to audit finances. IF it is his responsibility to handle his portion of finances, THEN he also has the right to decide if/what consequence occurs when a mistake is made.\n\nI am simple following the assertions made in the comments above mine and showing that they lead to a pretty silly conclusion, which is that if we take them to be true then we must blame OP for this situation. She cannot both be the person with the power to enact a punishment and also fully free from all responsibility for catching mistakes.", "Do you people even read the posts?

I'm very careful with money. No matter how well we do financially, I'll always look for good deals and avoid profligate spending.\n\nThe quantity of money lost is inconsequential to OP. It's simply the principle of waste and the fact that, by the rules they have artificially introduced regarding fun-money, pulling this from his fun-money pool delays something he's been looking forward to. But in no case does this unexpected expenditure change their budgeting, saving, any long-term financial goals, etc.", "Lol hilariously bad-faith take with a comically punitive strict-father type response.\n\nMaybe, and just maybe, when you're married to somebody you accept that part of that relationship is an ebb and flow of resources, responsibility, effort, and other such things and that making the next 2 months of your partners life worse to prove a point is actually a fucking terrible way to treat the people you claim to love.\n\nOP literally says like 3 times that she doesn't even care about the money but just about the principle of the things. Her \"punishment\" is literally just punitive nonsense."]}
