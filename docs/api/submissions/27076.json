The allowance is a smaller amount ($50-$100/week, but always equal for each of us) that gets moved to separate accounts for each of us, with the understanding that we can spend this money on whatever, no permission needed. Usually it's spent on individual hobbies/splurges. This works well for us. \n\n\nToday, I was looking through my husband's credit card bill that I had used recently (with his permission) to make some travel arrangements. We don't keep any secret bills. This credit card is auto-paid from our joint account. I saw a $73 charge to YouTube and asked him about it. He said he didn't remember buying anything, so I dug further. Turns out he had subscribed to YouTube TV last December to watch a football game on a road trip and forgot about it. I had no idea because this was his YouTube account, his email notifications, his credit card. The total charges added up to about $675. \n\n\nI admit I was annoyed and made some short comments. \"You should always set a reminder to cancel these things.\" \"If you responsible about checking your emails, this might not have happened.\" There is a history of him being irresponsible with bills and missing important emails. I manage almost all the finances. We're in good shape, but I hate the idea of waste. We weren't even utilizing that expensive subscription, he paid that money to watch one thing ten months ago. \n\n\nI told him that to be fair he'd have to pay the $675 out of his \"fun money\". He had more than enough in there because he was saving for a bigger hobby purchase. I cancelled the YT subscription on his phone, then used the banking app on my phone to move the money from his allowance account back to the joint account. I probably should've asked him to move the money himself, but I was upset. I felt more calm after doing the $ transfer because to me the matter was then settled. \n\n\nHe got irritated and said he shouldn't have to pay out of his allowance for a simple mistake. I said \"Everyone has to pay for their mistakes. That's how life works.\" Maybe I was harsh. But the wasted money was all on him. I don't see any better way to resolve it. \nHe pointed out that we are doing fine financially, we are fortunate that $675 out of the joint account won't affect our budgeting for the month, but it will make a big difference to his saving for his hobbies as it is close to 2 month's \"allowance.\"\nIt was the principle of the matter to me. I'm very careful with money. No matter how well we do financially, I'll always look for good deals and avoid profligate spending. \n\nSo, AITA for moving my husband's fun/allowance money to pay for a mistake he made?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate the responses, as reading the objective viewpoints helped me realize I behaved badly, more punitive than \"fair.\" Marriage is a partnership, not a balance sheet, and honest mistakes happen. I reacted out of irritation about the money without thinking about the bigger picture. \nI called my husband and apologized. He said he didn't blame me for being irritated, as he was irritated about the money too, but he appreciated the apology. He said we could talk later about moving the money back or not. \n\nThanks again, and feel free to keep weighing in with comments- I feel like healthy debate is the best part of AITA.", "created_utc": 1694974863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l8002/aita_for_making_my_husband_pay_for_a_mistake_out/", "score": 916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should still ask him to do it, but questioning why she would even try help her husband recover a significant amount of money seems rather obvious to me.", "idk he sure acted like a kid!", "yuppp", "I'm not saying \"I would ... if it were me\"  to him, I was typing it to this comment because they asked me if I would want my husband to do this to me (Golden rule). \n\nAnd they are right, I would not want my husband to \"punish\" me for a mistake, but I AM being truthful when I say I would've offered to pay it right away from my account. I have a lot of issues with guilt and paying back for my mistake would be a way for me to feel better. I realize this is a \"me\" problem. \n\nI haven't said anything about \"what I would do\" of the sort to my husband, in an apology or otherwise. \n\nAfter reading some of these responses I called him and told him that I was in the wrong to act the way I did moving the money, and I apologized. He appreciated the apology. We are going to discuss the money itself when he gets home, and move it back if he wishes, but I would say we have forgiven each other.", "*she was asked* \n\nJesus lol", "i agree that if thats how she apologises to him and isnt just the way shes talking here it doesnt count, and that just moving the money from his account to their joint account without even saying anything to him first was a dick move \n\nHowever, i dont think him paying for it is wrong. Since it doesnt actually do them financial damage, it shouldnt have been all in one go. Like 100$/month wouldve been fine imo \n\nSo yea i do think YTA OP but being upset about it was normal", "I\u2019d say the problem is actually her knee-jerk response to apologize. She shouldn\u2019t be guilted into thinking she did something wrong by people who\u2019ve grown up to think that being corrected is the worst thing that can happen to a person.", "[removed]", "They are both adults!! OP shouldn\u2019t have to monitor his credit card statements.  OP isn\u2019t his mom- this isn\u2019t an attack at OP, but at the husband. He needs to grow up and be an adult.  And OP is enabling his behavior by reacting to it by taking on more responsibility and \u201cpunishing\u201d him for his mistake.  Let him figure out a solution to his mistake on his own. \n\nI also stated above that I don\u2019t like the whole allowance thing- but if it is working for the both of you then that is all that matters. \n\nGive him more financial freedom in the relationship and more financial responsibility!!!\n\nThe more you do for him, the more permission you are giving him to continue to be clueless and irresponsible.\n\nSome people are better with finances than others, but everyone can learn to manage their finances in a way that works for them and can learn to improve their financial management.\n\nPS.  Just call YouTube and tell them you didn\u2019t realize you had the subscription and ask to be refunded.  I\u2019ve been subscribed to things I had no idea about until I eventually saw them on my statements.  The companies have always given me my money back.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re just being nice, can see I never used the subscription, or if it is a legal thing where they can\u2019t prove I subscribed because no documentation was signed, etc. But the companies have been understanding and accommodating. To note, I never asked to be refunded for a subscription that I actively use, lol. Only if it was a mistake or I forgot to cancel after the trial period and never used it again.", "YouTube TV is basically YT's version of cable. It allows watching live tv.", "Oh no. If there\u2019s a problem I decide I can\u2019t deal with its divorce time. My husband has a few times f-ed up. In those times I let him know I\u2019m not ok with this. In every instance he took total accountability and fixed it. By the time I woke up the next morning he had already made multiple phone calls to do things he needed to do to fix it. The reason why we\u2019re still together is because this is how he behaves. Neither of us are perfect people. When one of us messes up there better be honesty and total accountability. If not there is a problem that could lead to divorce town. It would never directly go to divorce town. There would be couples therapy probably before. But if a person can\u2019t take accountability for their actions they shouldn\u2019t even be married. I married a man and expect him to act like a man. He knows I respect him and we treat each other as equals. And I allow him to respect himself by letting him take care of his own shit. And then I tell him how much I love him and that I\u2019m proud of him.", "Other comment said that they paid it with their own credit card, which is autopaid from the joint account, which she manages. It's mostly his fault, but not entirely.", "The mistake was forgetting to cancel it. But it was a conscious decision to use the joint money account to pay for it rather than his fun money. That\u2019s where he messed up.", "The disrespect was not transferring it back HIMSELF. His mistake, he makes up for it.

Duh.", "A \u201csilly\u201d mistake that he expects her to help pay for. \n\nBullshit", "Ok, creepy.", "She is an authorized user of his account.
