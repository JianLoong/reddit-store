But I wasn't doing it because I felt threatened or thought OP was threatening anyone, I was doing it because the level of violence expressed could easily have made community members very uncomfortable. As a service to keep the sub safer.  \n\nSo: What is the deal? Is rule 5 a real rule on this sub? If someone talks about an event that has extreme violence in it, but they are not threatening violence to anyone, is this against the rules or not? \n\nI've already stopped reporting these kinds of posts, as it seems violence isn't taken seriously.

As a long time user you see one of these kind of posts get upvoted and then nothing else on the top page for the next month or so.\n\nDoes the moderation team have any plans to tackle this blatant karma farming? I feel like if Aita had a system like relationship\\_advice, where posts had an automatic karma limit there would be a huge decrease in the amount of unoriginal rage bait.

I tried to write down my story wording it nicely and properly, and it came up at 6000 characters. Even when I went Full Brevity Mode it still came up at 5000 characters. Shortening it by even 100 more would require the removal of significant portions that are important for the final verdict, much more if by 2000, which would essentially be just a butchered version of the original.", "Check out the link above to the June open forum discussion.  A great explanation of why the limit is in place.", "If you're breaking the limit then either you're providing too much irrelevant information about tying onions to your belt or the situation is too complex for aita.", "Thank you.", "Well, the 'extra' text actually works against me and is very much relevant, so it could be that it's too complicated. I haven't gotten a feel as to how complicated a matter must (not) be to be posted here. Thank you as well.", "It gets really frustrating when every post you try to click on today has been removed as a rule violation\u2026 for example, how is a dispute with someone who works at a business not an \u201cinterpersonal conflict\u201d? Business employees are people too, even if the business itself is not a person. (Technically the US Supreme Court thinks a business IS a person but I\u2019m not here to debate that.) Can we ease up on removing so many posts as breaking the rules though?!? I have never seen so many posts removed before\u2026 it\u2019s making the sub less interesting because so many posts are removed.  :(", "3000 characters already is too much. If it were up to me, I'd allow no more than 1000 characters. Seriously. Way too many stories here are filled with unnecessary details that don't add anything to the story and are just there to tip the scales in whatever direction the OP wants them to be tipped. I'm talking for things like \"I was poor in my childhood, but I fought tooth and nail to become a millionaire in my early 20s\" when the story is about the OP's behavior in a restaurant - just as an example. A lower character limit would probably help against this.\n\n5000 characters is more than three standard pages. This is the length of a freaking short story, not a description of one particular situation where you wonder whether you've been an asshole or not.", "It's always funny to me when a teenager's post casually mentions their parent cooking dinner for them/the family (not even necessarily central to the conflict) and everyone bombards them in the comments saying \"you're 17, why can't you cook for yourself?\"  \n\n\nOk....so are they saying once you know how to cook, everyone in a household must always cook every meal separately for themselves? That seems incredibly inefficient in terms of cost and labor.  \n\n\nI knew how to cook from a reasonably young age, and before that I could do things like make a sandwich, a bagel, cereal, etc... but when I was 17 it was still fairly common in our household to eat dinner with my parents. While any of us *might* make the family meal, I had one parent who genuinely enjoyed cooking and made the majority of shared dinners. It wasn't demanded, and if that parent wanted a break we could all either make our own low effort dinners or one of us would step up to make a family dinner.   \n\n\nI get where people are coming from if the conflict is a 17 year old complaining about their parent's cooking every day without being willing to do it themselves, but it's bizarre to me how people read \"I'm 17. My mom was cooking dinner for us the other night...\" and jump to \"You're almost an adult and can't cook for yourself? Are you 17 or 7?\" (obviously that's uncivil anyway, but there are also comments that are in line with rule 1 making a similar point).", "I agree with this. Just a few days ago I posted one of my first comments here under a story about a teenager wondering whether she was the asshole or not about not being happy with how her cat was behaving. The votes were predominantly YTA or ESH. The post was deleted, because, supposedly, there was no interpersonal conflict in it.", "I mean, yeah. A cat is not a person, and having feelings isn't a behavior.", "Is it assigned shifts or do you usually try to have a few mods on so if someone couldn\u2019t make it it wouldn\u2019t be a huge deal ?  \n\n\nCan someone still participate in the sub and use a alternative account to wear their mod hat .", "Plough through my profile and see what the post was about - it wasn't about a conflict between the OP and the cat, it was about a conflict between her and her family because of the cat.", "If it's the post from 4 days ago there's no conflict with the family.  It's OP wanting to get rid of their cat because it sprays everywhere. There's a line at the end that when they share with their friends and family those friends and family tell them they'd be a heartless asshole for doing so. This is a textbook example of no interpersonal conflict.\n\nIf you want to better understand how we define interpersonal conflict check out [this section of our FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_considered_an_interpersonal_conflict.3F)", "NTA", "In my family when I was growing up pretty much all meals were family meals. I've always found it kind of surprising that so many families don't do this.", "There have been a few times when I've been actively engaged in a thread that I was enjoying that ended up getting deleted for what I thought was an overly broad interpretation of the rules and it's made me want to tear my hair out.\n\nMost of the posts that are removed are removed for a good reason, though. I usually sort by \"new\" because it's almost always pointless to join a popular discussion late. However most new posts are, frankly, very low quality and a ton of them are clear rule violations. People are constantly trying to put up \"AITA for cutting this person out of my life\" and \"AITA because of how I feel about this thing\" posts. There's also a decent amount of blatant debate-bait posts.\nSo, yeah, a lot of posts are going to end up getting deleted because a lot are blatant rule violations.\n\nI do tend to agree with you on the posts about businesses, though. I don't really see how a dispute between a customer and a server or a customer and a retail worker isn't an interpersonal dispute. Or, for that matter, a dispute between a customer and a business owner. I would agree that a dispute between a person and \"business\" in the broad sense isn't an interpersonal dispute, but if it can be narrowed down to two or more people it should be allowed.", "I was curious, so I found the post you were talking about. Just my opinion as a non-moderator; that one was borderline. I guess you could argue that there was some interpersonal conflict just because people in her life were telling OP that she'd be TA for getting rid of the cat, but you could also argue that it was one of those \"AITA for feeling a certain way\" posts which are against the rules for good reason.", "The more mods on at a time, the better, because the queue can be quite large at times! But there's no schedule - we're all free to mod as much or as little as we want.\n\nSame goes for participation in the sub. Mods are free to participate in the sub if they wish, and modding from an alt is fine as well.", "Get the cat neutered and it will stop spraying. I've had dozens of male cats over the years, and it worked with every single one.", "Just a suggestion; would the mods consider adding a reportable rule against \"wall of texts\" posts? Maybe if a single paragraph exceeds a certain word count?\n\nAlthough I don't even know if a word count would be necessary; you know a wall of text post when you see one.", "> We have it do this because users generally hate when a post is removed with no reason given.\n\nI sense a very... begrudging tone from that.", "At the end of every post is a \u201cdon\u2019t downvote assholes\u201d pin, but I think there should also be a \u201cdon\u2019t downvote people who disagree with you\u201d\n\nLately I\u2019ve been reading a lot of posts on here where the OP is clearly being petty and unnecessarily dramatic, and their actions would def warrant an ESH at the very least. But the comments are all filled with \u201cNTA\u201d from people who love the drama of it all. While I understand this and it\u2019s fine, it creates this consensus in the comments where anyone who disagrees just doesn\u2019t comment. Why? Because they get downvoted into oblivion for disagreeing with the consensus, even when their points are perfectly reasonable. All this does is force the comment section into becoming an echo chamber.\n\nIt\u2019s so annoying. I want to give input on posts without being karma bombed just bc I have a different opinion than what people have already decided on.\n\nIf we want actual discussion and dissent here, we need to at least *try* to make sure people feel comfortable expressing their opinions.", "Cutting off contacts, ghosting, breaking friendships. Ffs that\u2019s all this sub is about.", "One thing I've noticed--with some exceptions--is that an \"ESH\" verdict is an almost sure way to get downvotes. I don't know if it's the nature of a sub like this, the age of the average person commenting, or what, but people here tend to get very black and white over disputes. There absolutely HAS to be a good and a bad guy. An \"ESH\" judgement is like showing a cross to a vampire because it introduces nuance to the situation and who wants that?\n\nSo yeah, I think that \"ESH\" is a very underused verdict because in real life it often (not always) takes two to tango. But if almost every time a person uses it he/she gets downvoted into oblivion I can see one reason *why* it's underused. The groupthink here and the piling on of any dissenting voice is a really annoying part of this sub.", "100% agree - I thought I was going crazy. Not to mention that sometimes, people go so far as to reply with insults to the dissenters. \n\nI just wish I could get more out of a post than the same comment 2k times. And maybe express my own opinion here and there too. Don\u2019t know what the mods can do about it besides a pinned message.", "Which was the fashion at the time!", "Exactly", "I often sort by \"controversial\" just to see the 8 or 9 dissenting opinions that haven't been deleted yet. Oftentimes the comments with like 300 downvotes are actually entirely reasonable and add to the discussion. Even if I don't necessarily agree it's good to see other perspectives.\n\nUnfortunately, though, yeah; your pinned comment idea is a good one but there really isn't much the mods can do. People for the most part know that the thumbs down button isn't supposed to be a \"disagree\" button but they don't care. It's a Reddit-wide problem.", "I just skip those ones. Sometimes OP can be receptive to advice suggesting they break it down into paragraphs (said nicely, of course). I found I got downvoted quite a lot though by later commenters who didn't see the original formatting.", "I genuinely find it puzzling too. Like, obviously past a certain age no one should insist someone else make ever meal for them, but I\u2019m in my 40s and when I visit home some nights parents cook and some nights I cook, but we always have one main cook and everyone else eats and does dishes.

If there's not enough drama in posts then some comments will just make it up.", "That boat rocking analogy is the latest hot topic", "The sub is bad for complex situations because it boils everything down to YTA or NTA.", "The increase in posts involving pregnancy has really made me worry about how little this sub generally knows about it. Everything so black and white with pregnancy, and sometimes I think it gets too cruel to expectant parents, and too many on here have no idea what all actually happens *medically* when you start *growing an entire human being in such a tiny space*.", "I've noticed that a lot of people just see ESH as meaning YTA. Sooo often when someone votes ESH I see people say \"so you're  [other person in the conflict] wasnt wrong???\" Like... no. Thats why its ESH.\n\nPeople also seem to take ESH as meaning that everyone was equally wrong, which isnt what the vote means at allllll", "AITA for giving up after dickety six miles?", "Why are there so many brother in law posts this past week?", "We actually have something in automod that messages OP to fix when there's a wall of text.

I wasn't one of those \"I love being pregnant\" women at all, there were a lot of difficult days and I was delighted to get to the end.\n\nBut I see a lot of the \"opposite\" thinking here on the sub to what you're complaining about: there's a lot of attitude that a pregnant woman should be able to act the asshole and blow up about the smallest annoyances, and everyone (especially their partner) needs to  kowtow and bend to whatever nonsense behaviour the woman is throwing out.", "I think there\u2019s a real blindness to the reality of pregnancy and the danger unless the person is talking about a scenario involving labor. I don\u2019t think everyone understands how a pregnant persons body can quite literally turn upside down and inside out long before contractions start. And it\u2019s *not* a walk in the park generally. For some it is, but Ive yet to meet a pregnant individual in real life who attempted to say they didn\u2019t feel any different.

I reported a great many comments as uncivil, but only some of them were removed. Here are some of the comments that were allowed to stay:\n\n* \"OP isn\u2019t very bright\"\n* \"What an odd specimen you are\u2026.\"\n* \"You weirdo\"\n* \"Holy shit you\u2019re purposely obtuse\"\n* \"you\u2019re clearly a petty little asshole on a power trip\"\n* \"Not surprised you agree with the only person on here who sounds as insufferable as you are\"\n* \"Maybe you should think of adding 'learning how to be self-aware' to your pre-6am tasks\"\n* \"How obtuse can this guy be?\"\n* \"You're obviously a terribly greedy person\"\n* \"[H]ow do you fit that ego through the door of your house?\"\n* \"He\u2019s weird and obsessive\"\n* \"The OP is definitely a case of someone with extremely low IQ who thinks he's smart\"\n* \"What an absolute doorknob\"\n* \"[It] makes you come off like a petulant child\"\n* \"you sad, selfish right ass\"\n* \"Dude you need help\"\n* \"...so you stop being a selfish, petty, ungrateful human being\"\n* \"Being an HOA asshat is just so taxing isn\u2019t it?\"\n* \"You\u2019re an asshole in a clown suit, that\u2019s what you are\"\n* \"[Y]ou suck\"\n* \"[I]magine being so much of a willful idiot... you should pay her... for having to deal with your insufferable ass\"\n* \"Aww woe is you. God, you\u2019re so fucking dramatic. Get over yourself.\"\n\nThese look like crystal clear examples of personal attacks. And even though \"extremely low IQ\" and \"obtuse\" are allowed, these very similar comments were removed:\n\n* \"Are yo\u2026are you stupid? YTA and likely a future ex husband lol\"\n* \"Is the \u00a3400 being handed to you in a check?? No it\u2019s being waived?? What a dumbass my god\"\n* \"wow. you\u2019re dumb. lol\"\n\n(Incidentally, I've reported several comments calling someone \"obtuse\", in different threads, but none of them have been removed. It seems as though it's okay to call someone stupid or a dumbass, as long as you use the word \"obtuse\" to do it.)\n\nSimilarly, the comment \"Lmfao you\u2019re charging your wife $200 for what exactly? You\u2019re the definition of a clown\" was removed, but the comment containing \"You\u2019re an asshole in a clown suit, that\u2019s what you are\" was allowed.\n\nIs there any sense to be made of this pattern of removals and non-removals?

The body of the post will say it was removed, there will almost always be a stickied mod comment explaining what rule it was removed under, and that will be that.  \n\n\nA deleted post - If a post was deleted, it was the user themself who deleted it. Could be for a variety of reasons including either being frustrated they didn't get responses they liked, or if it gained more visibility than they expected, or if they received aggressive messages, etc...  \n\n\nA \"locked thread\" - When a thread is locked, the post is not removed but no one can participate in the comments anymore. This happens when the post itself didn't break rules and doesn't need to be removed, but there are enough rule breaking/derailing/uncivil comments/reports that the mods decide to shut down the thread. Maybe it's because commenters were really piling on insults to OP or someone else in the story and mods didn't have the person-power to keep up with removals, or maybe it's because the subject matter of the post is tangent to rule-breaking content (like a topic covered under the no violence rule) and the conversation keeps turning in that direction until the mods decide the discussion is all in all not appropriate for the sub. Basically it's not a punishment to anyone, but a tool when the mods for whatever variety of reasons are unable or unwilling to dedicate enough time and energy to moderating a thread effectively and fairly (and really all sorts of reasons for this are fair, anything from wanting to shut down escalating violent conversations, to them being a group of volunteers who don't want to throw away their whole weekend deleting the same 200 comments calling OP a 'karen' or something).  \n\n\nMonthly forums - These monthly meta-threads are \"closed\" at the turn of the month, when a new one is started.", "A lot of people also literally don't know what it means.

Because I find that mind boggling, and often problematic (though to each their own as long as it's not pushed on others?)\n\nI'll see posts about someone prioritizing a lifelong friendship over a romantic partner of 6 months in a given difficult situation (ranging from taking a side in an argument, to going to the friend's important event over the romantic interest's event, etc...) and comments will completely *slaughter* them for having the audacity to consider \"choosing\" their friend.\n\n(Side note, \"choosing a side\" in a conflict is not the same as choosing a person/prioritizing a person. If my long long long term romantic partner I love deeply is behaving incredibly wrong in a conflict, telling them I disagree with them is not 'choosing someone else over them' anyway, but back to the point...)\n\nI mean...no. Even setting aside the debate around the notion that ultimately one's romantic relationship *must* be the most important one in someone's life, no one gets there overnight. People will have differing perspectives even when it comes to spouses. But setting that aside, I swear people on this sub act like someone is a monster for admitting through words or actions that their friendship of 20 years is more important than a romantic relationship of 4 months. \"If she isn't your top priority, why are you even dating her???\" Uh, sure. A new relationship of 4 months is not a top priority over a meaningful friendship of 20 years. That's not to say the romantic relationship wouldn't *become* more deep, meaningful, and ultimately \"more important\" (for those who are so deeply attached to the idea that we must always be ranking the relationships in our lives) than a platonic friend of 20 years, but that doesn't happen overnight.\n\nIt's bizarre to me. Partially because I don't think a relationship being romantic automatically makes it \"more important\" than another type of relationship (I think it will vary individual to individual), partially because I don't understand the obsession with ranking love and relationships constantly, and partially because relationships change and grow over time. It's reasonable, and common, that people would find the \"endgame\" romantic relationship stronger and more important than others - I really do get that - But that doesn't mean there's a switch where someone becomes that overnight. You go from a first date, to a few weeks, some months, years, etc....and *somewhere* along the way that person becomes the most important person to you, but I can guarantee it's not the exact second they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nIf I was 4 months into a romantic relationship, posted about a conflict regarding my romantic partner and a lifelong friend, and someone said \"YTA, It sounds like you care more about your friend than your partner\" I'd probably have the internal reaction of \"Well yep, that makes sense because I *do* care more about my friend than my romantic partner, but why am I TA?\"", "The rampant biphobia on this sub is disgusting.
