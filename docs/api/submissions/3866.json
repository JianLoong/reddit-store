This is the place to share all your meta thoughts about the sub, and to have a dialogue with the mod team.\n\n\n#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\nDecember is already underway, with year-end holidays fast-approaching! We thought we'd do a quick recap of our monthly deep dives this past year.\n\n[January - Rule 3 reporting change](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rtvtft/aita_monthly_open_forum_january_2022/)\n\n[February - Rule 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/si07tp/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2022/)\n\n[March - Rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t4eh7s/aita_monthly_open_forum_march_2022/)\n\n[April - Rule 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tunibp/aita_monthly_open_forum_april_2022/)\n\n[May - Moderating the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uh5wgn/aita_monthly_open_forum_may_2022/)\n\n[June - Rule 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v2irhy/aita_monthly_open_forum_june_2022/)\n\n[July - Judgment Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vozn9i/aita_monthly_open_forum_july_2022/)\n\n[August - General FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wdhrop/aita_monthly_open_forum_august_2022/)\n\n[September - Rule 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x399by/aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2022/)\n\n[October - Rule 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xt1ksm/aita_monthly_open_forum_spooktober_2022/)\n\n[November - Rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj9wlq/aita_monthly_open_forum_november_2022_civility/)\n\nI'm sure there will be questions, since it's almost that time - we will have something about the yearly Best-Of in next month's Open Forum. \n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\nWe always need mods for the US overnight hours. Currently, we could also definitely benefit from mods active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mood tools are improving and trickling in, but not quite there yet.\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.\n\n---\n\nWe'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar!

But I wasn't doing it because I felt threatened or thought OP was threatening anyone, I was doing it because the level of violence expressed could easily have made community members very uncomfortable. As a service to keep the sub safer.  \n\nSo: What is the deal? Is rule 5 a real rule on this sub? If someone talks about an event that has extreme violence in it, but they are not threatening violence to anyone, is this against the rules or not? \n\nI've already stopped reporting these kinds of posts, as it seems violence isn't taken seriously. (Or y'all are totally overworked and something goes wrong in the reporting/mod process.)\n\nI'm just still confused about why my reports got shunted off to a general reddit rule about \"threatening violence\".", "It's a volunteer gig.", "I used to be confused by those replies when I reported content too. But please continue to report! Those replies you're getting are from Reddit Admins, as they also get the Rule 5 reports. As mods, we don't respond to the reports, but we review every single piece of reported content. And yes, we absolutely will remove violent content.", "Just to help folks out:\n\nJanuary - Rule 3 reporting change (Accept Your Judgement)\n\nFebruary - Rule 7 (Post Interpersonal Conflicts)\n\nMarch - Rule 3 (Accept Your Judgment)\n\nApril - Rule 5 (No Violence)\n\nMay - Moderating the sub\n\nJune - Rule 6 (How To Post)\n\nJuly - Judgment Bot\n\nAugust - General FAQs\n\nSeptember - Rule 14 (No Medical Conflicts)\n\nOctober - Rule 12 (This Is Not A Debate Sub)\n\nNovember - Rule 1 (Be Civil)", "What's up with the \"this user is currently shadow-banned or suspended by Reddit admins\" thing that sometimes gets pinned as the reason a post was removed?\n\n\n\nI don't see it on other subs and am curious about it.  How do you know that poster is shadow banned? Why does it result in an automatic post removal?", "Judgment Bot scans the sub for posts by those evading a ban and will pin that as the reason. \n\nWe have it do this because users generally hate when a post is removed with no reason given.\n\n(edit - typo)", "Hi I only stop by at the end of the year for the \"best of\" ones..... when  will that start?", "More info in next month\u2019s open forum.", "Thanks! \ud83d\ude0a", "I've been on the sub for years now and whenever there is a post that gets upvoted a lot or gets a lot of karma for \"rage baiting\" there are always a flood of the same type of post in the next month,  to the point where it's obvious that people are faking posts for karma.\n\n Examples of this are like the trend of \"sibling slept with my fiance(e), now my family wants me to go to their wedding/forgive them\",  \"step-parent wants to assume a parental role when I don't want it\", or simply just blatant rage bait. As a long time user you see one of these kind of posts get upvoted and then nothing else on the top page for the next month or so.\n\nDoes the moderation team have any plans to tackle this blatant karma farming? I feel like if Aita had a system like relationship\\_advice, where posts had an automatic karma limit there would be a huge decrease in the amount of unoriginal rage bait. Or perhaps a system where extremely common dilemmas that have been posed multiple times get removed.", "I'm loving this new trend of \"Can you watch my child during an emergency?\" posts. I find the lines between caring about a person to help out and you don't owe anybody anything thinking to be so interesting. Also the high levels of F them kids makes it funny as well.\n\nI hope it lasts all month.", "Don't really have much to say except the MIL troll is extremely annoying and predictable and there's clearly another troll that's getting to be annoying as well. It's the wife who's always getting her BIL to do something for her or getting involved in her husband and BIL's business or letting her son interrupt their meetings. \n\nCome to think of it, there's another troll, the one with the ex who is rich and makes the OP live with him or else. \n\nIt's wild.", "Is the 3000 characters limit really necessary? I tried to write down my story wording it nicely and properly, and it came up at 6000 characters. Even when I went Full Brevity Mode it still came up at 5000 characters. Shortening it by even 100 more would require the removal of significant portions that are important for the final verdict, much more if by 2000, which would essentially be just a butchered version of the original.", "Check out the link above to the June open forum discussion.  A great explanation of why the limit is in place.", "If you're breaking the limit then either you're providing too much irrelevant information about tying onions to your belt or the situation is too complex for aita.", "Thank you.", "Well, the 'extra' text actually works against me and is very much relevant, so it could be that it's too complicated. I haven't gotten a feel as to how complicated a matter must (not) be to be posted here. Thank you as well.", "It gets really frustrating when every post you try to click on today has been removed as a rule violation\u2026 for example, how is a dispute with someone who works at a business not an \u201cinterpersonal conflict\u201d? Business employees are people too, even if the business itself is not a person. (Technically the US Supreme Court thinks a business IS a person but I\u2019m not here to debate that.) Can we ease up on removing so many posts as breaking the rules though?!? I have never seen so many posts removed before\u2026 it\u2019s making the sub less interesting because so many posts are removed.  :(", "3000 characters already is too much. If it were up to me, I'd allow no more than 1000 characters. Seriously. Way too many stories here are filled with unnecessary details that don't add anything to the story and are just there to tip the scales in whatever direction the OP wants them to be tipped. I'm talking for things like \"I was poor in my childhood, but I fought tooth and nail to become a millionaire in my early 20s\" when the story is about the OP's behavior in a restaurant - just as an example. A lower character limit would probably help against this.\n\n5000 characters is more than three standard pages. This is the length of a freaking short story, not a description of one particular situation where you wonder whether you've been an asshole or not."]}
