But I wasn't doing it because I felt threatened or thought OP was threatening anyone, I was doing it because the level of violence expressed could easily have made community members very uncomfortable. As a service to keep the sub safer.  \n\nSo: What is the deal? Is rule 5 a real rule on this sub? If someone talks about an event that has extreme violence in it, but they are not threatening violence to anyone, is this against the rules or not? \n\nI've already stopped reporting these kinds of posts, as it seems violence isn't taken seriously.

As a long time user you see one of these kind of posts get upvoted and then nothing else on the top page for the next month or so.\n\nDoes the moderation team have any plans to tackle this blatant karma farming? I feel like if Aita had a system like relationship\\_advice, where posts had an automatic karma limit there would be a huge decrease in the amount of unoriginal rage bait.

I tried to write down my story wording it nicely and properly, and it came up at 6000 characters. Even when I went Full Brevity Mode it still came up at 5000 characters. Shortening it by even 100 more would require the removal of significant portions that are important for the final verdict, much more if by 2000, which would essentially be just a butchered version of the original.", "Check out the link above to the June open forum discussion.  A great explanation of why the limit is in place.", "If you're breaking the limit then either you're providing too much irrelevant information about tying onions to your belt or the situation is too complex for aita.", "Thank you.", "Well, the 'extra' text actually works against me and is very much relevant, so it could be that it's too complicated. I haven't gotten a feel as to how complicated a matter must (not) be to be posted here. Thank you as well.", "It gets really frustrating when every post you try to click on today has been removed as a rule violation\u2026 for example, how is a dispute with someone who works at a business not an \u201cinterpersonal conflict\u201d? Business employees are people too, even if the business itself is not a person. (Technically the US Supreme Court thinks a business IS a person but I\u2019m not here to debate that.) Can we ease up on removing so many posts as breaking the rules though?!? I have never seen so many posts removed before\u2026 it\u2019s making the sub less interesting because so many posts are removed.  :(", "3000 characters already is too much. If it were up to me, I'd allow no more than 1000 characters. Seriously. Way too many stories here are filled with unnecessary details that don't add anything to the story and are just there to tip the scales in whatever direction the OP wants them to be tipped. I'm talking for things like \"I was poor in my childhood, but I fought tooth and nail to become a millionaire in my early 20s\" when the story is about the OP's behavior in a restaurant - just as an example. A lower character limit would probably help against this.\n\n5000 characters is more than three standard pages. This is the length of a freaking short story, not a description of one particular situation where you wonder whether you've been an asshole or not.", "It's always funny to me when a teenager's post casually mentions their parent cooking dinner for them/the family (not even necessarily central to the conflict) and everyone bombards them in the comments saying \"you're 17, why can't you cook for yourself?\"  \n\n\nOk....so are they saying once you know how to cook, everyone in a household must always cook every meal separately for themselves? That seems incredibly inefficient in terms of cost and labor.  \n\n\nI knew how to cook from a reasonably young age, and before that I could do things like make a sandwich, a bagel, cereal, etc... but when I was 17 it was still fairly common in our household to eat dinner with my parents. While any of us *might* make the family meal, I had one parent who genuinely enjoyed cooking and made the majority of shared dinners. It wasn't demanded, and if that parent wanted a break we could all either make our own low effort dinners or one of us would step up to make a family dinner.   \n\n\nI get where people are coming from if the conflict is a 17 year old complaining about their parent's cooking every day without being willing to do it themselves, but it's bizarre to me how people read \"I'm 17. My mom was cooking dinner for us the other night...\" and jump to \"You're almost an adult and can't cook for yourself? Are you 17 or 7?\" (obviously that's uncivil anyway, but there are also comments that are in line with rule 1 making a similar point).", "I agree with this. Just a few days ago I posted one of my first comments here under a story about a teenager wondering whether she was the asshole or not about not being happy with how her cat was behaving. The votes were predominantly YTA or ESH. The post was deleted, because, supposedly, there was no interpersonal conflict in it.", "I mean, yeah. A cat is not a person, and having feelings isn't a behavior.", "Is it assigned shifts or do you usually try to have a few mods on so if someone couldn\u2019t make it it wouldn\u2019t be a huge deal ?  \n\n\nCan someone still participate in the sub and use a alternative account to wear their mod hat .", "Plough through my profile and see what the post was about - it wasn't about a conflict between the OP and the cat, it was about a conflict between her and her family because of the cat.", "If it's the post from 4 days ago there's no conflict with the family.  It's OP wanting to get rid of their cat because it sprays everywhere. There's a line at the end that when they share with their friends and family those friends and family tell them they'd be a heartless asshole for doing so. This is a textbook example of no interpersonal conflict.\n\nIf you want to better understand how we define interpersonal conflict check out [this section of our FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_considered_an_interpersonal_conflict.3F)", "NTA", "In my family when I was growing up pretty much all meals were family meals. I've always found it kind of surprising that so many families don't do this.", "There have been a few times when I've been actively engaged in a thread that I was enjoying that ended up getting deleted for what I thought was an overly broad interpretation of the rules and it's made me want to tear my hair out.\n\nMost of the posts that are removed are removed for a good reason, though. I usually sort by \"new\" because it's almost always pointless to join a popular discussion late. However most new posts are, frankly, very low quality and a ton of them are clear rule violations. People are constantly trying to put up \"AITA for cutting this person out of my life\" and \"AITA because of how I feel about this thing\" posts. There's also a decent amount of blatant debate-bait posts.\nSo, yeah, a lot of posts are going to end up getting deleted because a lot are blatant rule violations.\n\nI do tend to agree with you on the posts about businesses, though. I don't really see how a dispute between a customer and a server or a customer and a retail worker isn't an interpersonal dispute. Or, for that matter, a dispute between a customer and a business owner. I would agree that a dispute between a person and \"business\" in the broad sense isn't an interpersonal dispute, but if it can be narrowed down to two or more people it should be allowed.", "I was curious, so I found the post you were talking about. Just my opinion as a non-moderator; that one was borderline. I guess you could argue that there was some interpersonal conflict just because people in her life were telling OP that she'd be TA for getting rid of the cat, but you could also argue that it was one of those \"AITA for feeling a certain way\" posts which are against the rules for good reason.", "The more mods on at a time, the better, because the queue can be quite large at times! But there's no schedule - we're all free to mod as much or as little as we want.\n\nSame goes for participation in the sub. Mods are free to participate in the sub if they wish, and modding from an alt is fine as well.", "Get the cat neutered and it will stop spraying. I've had dozens of male cats over the years, and it worked with every single one.", "Just a suggestion; would the mods consider adding a reportable rule against \"wall of texts\" posts? Maybe if a single paragraph exceeds a certain word count?\n\nAlthough I don't even know if a word count would be necessary; you know a wall of text post when you see one.", "> We have it do this because users generally hate when a post is removed with no reason given.\n\nI sense a very... begrudging tone from that.", "At the end of every post is a \u201cdon\u2019t downvote assholes\u201d pin, but I think there should also be a \u201cdon\u2019t downvote people who disagree with you\u201d\n\nLately I\u2019ve been reading a lot of posts on here where the OP is clearly being petty and unnecessarily dramatic, and their actions would def warrant an ESH at the very least. But the comments are all filled with \u201cNTA\u201d from people who love the drama of it all. While I understand this and it\u2019s fine, it creates this consensus in the comments where anyone who disagrees just doesn\u2019t comment. Why? Because they get downvoted into oblivion for disagreeing with the consensus, even when their points are perfectly reasonable. All this does is force the comment section into becoming an echo chamber.\n\nIt\u2019s so annoying. I want to give input on posts without being karma bombed just bc I have a different opinion than what people have already decided on.\n\nIf we want actual discussion and dissent here, we need to at least *try* to make sure people feel comfortable expressing their opinions.", "Cutting off contacts, ghosting, breaking friendships. Ffs that\u2019s all this sub is about.", "One thing I've noticed--with some exceptions--is that an \"ESH\" verdict is an almost sure way to get downvotes. I don't know if it's the nature of a sub like this, the age of the average person commenting, or what, but people here tend to get very black and white over disputes. There absolutely HAS to be a good and a bad guy. An \"ESH\" judgement is like showing a cross to a vampire because it introduces nuance to the situation and who wants that?\n\nSo yeah, I think that \"ESH\" is a very underused verdict because in real life it often (not always) takes two to tango. But if almost every time a person uses it he/she gets downvoted into oblivion I can see one reason *why* it's underused. The groupthink here and the piling on of any dissenting voice is a really annoying part of this sub.", "100% agree - I thought I was going crazy. Not to mention that sometimes, people go so far as to reply with insults to the dissenters. \n\nI just wish I could get more out of a post than the same comment 2k times. And maybe express my own opinion here and there too. Don\u2019t know what the mods can do about it besides a pinned message.", "Which was the fashion at the time!", "Exactly", "I often sort by \"controversial\" just to see the 8 or 9 dissenting opinions that haven't been deleted yet. Oftentimes the comments with like 300 downvotes are actually entirely reasonable and add to the discussion. Even if I don't necessarily agree it's good to see other perspectives.\n\nUnfortunately, though, yeah; your pinned comment idea is a good one but there really isn't much the mods can do. People for the most part know that the thumbs down button isn't supposed to be a \"disagree\" button but they don't care. It's a Reddit-wide problem.", "I just skip those ones. Sometimes OP can be receptive to advice suggesting they break it down into paragraphs (said nicely, of course). I found I got downvoted quite a lot though by later commenters who didn't see the original formatting.", "I genuinely find it puzzling too. Like, obviously past a certain age no one should insist someone else make ever meal for them, but I\u2019m in my 40s and when I visit home some nights parents cook and some nights I cook, but we always have one main cook and everyone else eats and does dishes.

If there's not enough drama in posts then some comments will just make it up.", "That boat rocking analogy is the latest hot topic", "The sub is bad for complex situations because it boils everything down to YTA or NTA.", "The increase in posts involving pregnancy has really made me worry about how little this sub generally knows about it. Everything so black and white with pregnancy, and sometimes I think it gets too cruel to expectant parents, and too many on here have no idea what all actually happens *medically* when you start *growing an entire human being in such a tiny space*.", "I've noticed that a lot of people just see ESH as meaning YTA. Sooo often when someone votes ESH I see people say \"so you're  [other person in the conflict] wasnt wrong???\" Like... no. Thats why its ESH.\n\nPeople also seem to take ESH as meaning that everyone was equally wrong, which isnt what the vote means at allllll", "AITA for giving up after dickety six miles?", "Why are there so many brother in law posts this past week?", "We actually have something in automod that messages OP to fix when there's a wall of text.

I wasn't one of those \"I love being pregnant\" women at all, there were a lot of difficult days and I was delighted to get to the end.\n\nBut I see a lot of the \"opposite\" thinking here on the sub to what you're complaining about: there's a lot of attitude that a pregnant woman should be able to act the asshole and blow up about the smallest annoyances, and everyone (especially their partner) needs to  kowtow and bend to whatever nonsense behaviour the woman is throwing out.", "I think there\u2019s a real blindness to the reality of pregnancy and the danger unless the person is talking about a scenario involving labor. I don\u2019t think everyone understands how a pregnant persons body can quite literally turn upside down and inside out long before contractions start. And it\u2019s *not* a walk in the park generally. For some it is, but Ive yet to meet a pregnant individual in real life who attempted to say they didn\u2019t feel any different.

I reported a great many comments as uncivil, but only some of them were removed. Here are some of the comments that were allowed to stay:\n\n* \"OP isn\u2019t very bright\"\n* \"What an odd specimen you are\u2026.\"\n* \"You weirdo\"\n* \"Holy shit you\u2019re purposely obtuse\"\n* \"you\u2019re clearly a petty little asshole on a power trip\"\n* \"Not surprised you agree with the only person on here who sounds as insufferable as you are\"\n* \"Maybe you should think of adding 'learning how to be self-aware' to your pre-6am tasks\"\n* \"How obtuse can this guy be?\"\n* \"You're obviously a terribly greedy person\"\n* \"[H]ow do you fit that ego through the door of your house?\"\n* \"He\u2019s weird and obsessive\"\n* \"The OP is definitely a case of someone with extremely low IQ who thinks he's smart\"\n* \"What an absolute doorknob\"\n* \"[It] makes you come off like a petulant child\"\n* \"you sad, selfish right ass\"\n* \"Dude you need help\"\n* \"...so you stop being a selfish, petty, ungrateful human being\"\n* \"Being an HOA asshat is just so taxing isn\u2019t it?\"\n* \"You\u2019re an asshole in a clown suit, that\u2019s what you are\"\n* \"[Y]ou suck\"\n* \"[I]magine being so much of a willful idiot... you should pay her... for having to deal with your insufferable ass\"\n* \"Aww woe is you. God, you\u2019re so fucking dramatic. Get over yourself.\"\n\nThese look like crystal clear examples of personal attacks. And even though \"extremely low IQ\" and \"obtuse\" are allowed, these very similar comments were removed:\n\n* \"Are yo\u2026are you stupid? YTA and likely a future ex husband lol\"\n* \"Is the \u00a3400 being handed to you in a check?? No it\u2019s being waived?? What a dumbass my god\"\n* \"wow. you\u2019re dumb. lol\"\n\n(Incidentally, I've reported several comments calling someone \"obtuse\", in different threads, but none of them have been removed. It seems as though it's okay to call someone stupid or a dumbass, as long as you use the word \"obtuse\" to do it.)\n\nSimilarly, the comment \"Lmfao you\u2019re charging your wife $200 for what exactly? You\u2019re the definition of a clown\" was removed, but the comment containing \"You\u2019re an asshole in a clown suit, that\u2019s what you are\" was allowed.\n\nIs there any sense to be made of this pattern of removals and non-removals?

The body of the post will say it was removed, there will almost always be a stickied mod comment explaining what rule it was removed under, and that will be that.  \n\n\nA deleted post - If a post was deleted, it was the user themself who deleted it. Could be for a variety of reasons including either being frustrated they didn't get responses they liked, or if it gained more visibility than they expected, or if they received aggressive messages, etc...  \n\n\nA \"locked thread\" - When a thread is locked, the post is not removed but no one can participate in the comments anymore. This happens when the post itself didn't break rules and doesn't need to be removed, but there are enough rule breaking/derailing/uncivil comments/reports that the mods decide to shut down the thread. Maybe it's because commenters were really piling on insults to OP or someone else in the story and mods didn't have the person-power to keep up with removals, or maybe it's because the subject matter of the post is tangent to rule-breaking content (like a topic covered under the no violence rule) and the conversation keeps turning in that direction until the mods decide the discussion is all in all not appropriate for the sub. Basically it's not a punishment to anyone, but a tool when the mods for whatever variety of reasons are unable or unwilling to dedicate enough time and energy to moderating a thread effectively and fairly (and really all sorts of reasons for this are fair, anything from wanting to shut down escalating violent conversations, to them being a group of volunteers who don't want to throw away their whole weekend deleting the same 200 comments calling OP a 'karen' or something).  \n\n\nMonthly forums - These monthly meta-threads are \"closed\" at the turn of the month, when a new one is started.", "A lot of people also literally don't know what it means.

Because I find that mind boggling, and often problematic (though to each their own as long as it's not pushed on others?)\n\nI'll see posts about someone prioritizing a lifelong friendship over a romantic partner of 6 months in a given difficult situation (ranging from taking a side in an argument, to going to the friend's important event over the romantic interest's event, etc...) and comments will completely *slaughter* them for having the audacity to consider \"choosing\" their friend.\n\n(Side note, \"choosing a side\" in a conflict is not the same as choosing a person/prioritizing a person. If my long long long term romantic partner I love deeply is behaving incredibly wrong in a conflict, telling them I disagree with them is not 'choosing someone else over them' anyway, but back to the point...)\n\nI mean...no. Even setting aside the debate around the notion that ultimately one's romantic relationship *must* be the most important one in someone's life, no one gets there overnight. People will have differing perspectives even when it comes to spouses. But setting that aside, I swear people on this sub act like someone is a monster for admitting through words or actions that their friendship of 20 years is more important than a romantic relationship of 4 months. \"If she isn't your top priority, why are you even dating her???\" Uh, sure. A new relationship of 4 months is not a top priority over a meaningful friendship of 20 years. That's not to say the romantic relationship wouldn't *become* more deep, meaningful, and ultimately \"more important\" (for those who are so deeply attached to the idea that we must always be ranking the relationships in our lives) than a platonic friend of 20 years, but that doesn't happen overnight.\n\nIt's bizarre to me. Partially because I don't think a relationship being romantic automatically makes it \"more important\" than another type of relationship (I think it will vary individual to individual), partially because I don't understand the obsession with ranking love and relationships constantly, and partially because relationships change and grow over time. It's reasonable, and common, that people would find the \"endgame\" romantic relationship stronger and more important than others - I really do get that - But that doesn't mean there's a switch where someone becomes that overnight. You go from a first date, to a few weeks, some months, years, etc....and *somewhere* along the way that person becomes the most important person to you, but I can guarantee it's not the exact second they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nIf I was 4 months into a romantic relationship, posted about a conflict regarding my romantic partner and a lifelong friend, and someone said \"YTA, It sounds like you care more about your friend than your partner\" I'd probably have the internal reaction of \"Well yep, that makes sense because I *do* care more about my friend than my romantic partner, but why am I TA?\"", "The rampant biphobia on this sub is disgusting.

It's also not unreasonable for someone to say no, prioritize their own plans, or have limitations or boundaries.\n\nAt the end of the day, no, asking someone to babysit is not abuse.

It's their responsibility, and while I would in all likelihood agree to help at various times if I'm available, that doesn't make the kid a \"shared responsibility.\"\n\nSo no, as my comment clearly outlined, babysitting is not the same thing as chores. Neither in terms of household responsibilities, nor in terms of the weight of the responsibility. And this isn't a \"no one owes each other anything/not legally obligated\" stance. There's a stark difference between believing in the value of people helping each other out and doing something kind for someone else, and acting like one person's child is a shared responsibility.\n\nAnd this may sound more extreme but I'm throwing it out there - I find it incredibly odd at best that anybody would leave their child with someone who doesn't want to watch them or doesn't feel confident watching them. That doesn't sound like a recipe for success.\n\nLooking after one's sibling IS life or death, worst case scenario. Cleaning the bathroom isn't. Babysitting isn't a basic life skill everyone will need when they leave the house. It's a life skill that some people will opt into, and others won't.", "Wow.

But after a few hours, not only did OP remove their post, but had seemingly deleted/hid the top YTA judgements.

That's on me for assuming!", "Are you sure they were deleted and not just shuffled to the bottom?

Repetition is one of them. Eyeroll away for sure, but hopefully that explains what the intention is behind it, because I don't think people are under the impression that multiple YTAs mean they'll be 'tallied' more or something (which isn't how the verdict is decided anyway).", "Usually if a rule seems 'selectively enforced' it comes down to two possible explanations:  \n\n\n1. Whether or not a post was reported\n2. A misunderstanding of the rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe mods are pretty open that yep they're human and so sometimes a mistake is made, but a follow up with mod mail corrects mistakes pretty swiftly, and all in all they prioritize consistent modding.   \n\n\nSometimes there are definitely discrepancies in what is removed for breaking a rule, but that's usually because there's a discrepancy in what is reported. If a post isn't reported, a mod can't review it and remove it. So it's true sometimes posts that break rule 11 stay up because no one reports it, while others that are reported are removed, even if both posts break the rule. But that's not inconsistent modding, it's inconsistent reporting.   \n\n\nThere are also times as users we think we understand all the ways a rule is applied but have part of it wrong. Whether it's coming to learn that rule 1 includes uncivil comments about a 3rd party in OP's post, or a fictional character, or coming to learn that rule 5 includes threats of property damage, etc...  \n\n\nI still get confused with the nuances of rule 11 at times. But if you're looking for a better explanation, which I definitely cannot give, I recommend phrasing your question to ask about how that rule is applied or what those nuances are. If you're confused about why a particular post does or doesn't break the rule, you could ask more specifically about that (without linking in these open forums).   \n\n\nI've found the mods are very willing to engage sincerely in conversations about how the rules are applied when asked a specific question in good faith. Asking \"why don't you enforce this rule\" is a difficult place to start, because it's more of an accusation than a genuine question. If you're looking for information to understand the rule better, it could be more helpful to phrase it along the lines of \"I reported a post about XYZ for breaking rule 11 but it looks like it wasn't removed. Could you explain why that post doesn't break rule 11?\" (It's also possible they just didn't see your report yet).", "Let's be fair here. You've been engaging in \\*exceptionally\\* bad faith this entire time. The moderation team hasn't insulted you, we've simply responded appropriately to someone who periodically shows up in modmail to make passive-aggressive digs or antagonistic comments on the sub. \n\nWe removed a post of yours- entirely appropriately- because it broke Rule 11. After arguing with us about whether it broke Rule 11, you (for whatever reason) got upset with us because the post also wasn't allowed on the relationship sub you tried. We explained that's not something we have any control over and you were still frustrated because we weren't taking the time to search through hundreds of subreddits for you and find one that would take your post. \n\nThen we removed an uncivil comment of yours (again, appropriately, it was really uncivil) and had another conversation about how enforcing Rule 11 works. We told you at the time we'll happily remove every piece of rule breaking material \\*that we are made aware of\\*. You made an unfounded claim that we'll leave a post up if it's popular enough (We don't. We remove plenty of popular posts and get plenty of hate for doing so, even when the rule breaking is really clearly defined) and ignored our multiple requests that you utilize the report function.\n\nSo as we've been telling you this entire time, \\*use the report function\\*. We'll look at the post. If it breaks rule 11, we'll take it down. If it doesn't, we won't. The more people who use the report function appropriately, the more likely we are to see the rule breaking content and remove it in a timely fashion.  If what you \\*actually\\* want is for the mod team to be able to more effectively handle rule breaking content, we've provided you the path to facilitate that. But right now it seems more like you've been nursing a grudge for the last 2 months because we appropriately removed a post of yours and are looking for any opportunity you can find to snark about it. You're an adult, please start behaving like one.", "See I just haven't had that experience with them.\n\nWhen I follow up with the mods, they usually tell me how I'm upset, which I'm not, and then base their every response as if I'm like upset and angry at them until they respond with some kind of jab and mute me so they get the last word. \n\nAnd they still do, even after I tell them I'm not upset. So their every response towards me is that I'm angry and upset about that post, and no matter how many times I say it isn't, they still make that assumption and assume everything I'm saying is in bad faith. \n\nAnd they tell me how I'm still upset in a taunting kind of way that diminishes everything else I'm trying to say. \n\nLike I don't like using this as an excuse or anything, but I'm autistic, I say what I mean and don't play word games with hidden intentions and hidden messages between the lines, but I can't escape how every time I interact with the mod team, they immediately assume I'm still upset. But if I'm upset, I'll say I'm upset, I don't even understand why someone would lie to others about not being upset if they're actually upset, it achieves nothing. \n\nMy original post was something that at the moment was incredibly distressing to me, because as someone with ASD I genuinely didn't know if I was in the wrong or not and needed some input and didn't know where to go. \n\nAfter that post was removed, I got extremely curt, rude, and unhelpful answers as to why my post was removed.\n\nAt that moment I was confused and hurt because I had seen so many similar posts be allowed that became top posts. And the entire exchange just stuck with me.\n\nThe excuses they gave didn't make any sense based off how my post was removed, and later after I started reporting similar posts for breaking rule 11, I didn't see any of them be taken down. So I'm still sitting here confused about how it's enforced because the reasons they give seem hypocritical. \n\nSo while I'm not upset about that post or the situation anymore, the response from the mod team stuck with me, and I'm trying to be the squeaky wheel as a reminder for better and more consistent enforcement.", "I've actually told you guys multiple times that I'm not even upset that the post was removed anymore. I forgot what the post was about. \n\nWhat stuck with me was the rudeness of the mod team and the multiple hypocritical reasons on why some posts were allowed that broke rule 11 and some aren't. This is also after I let you guys know that at the moment I was panicky due to the content of my post being pretty distressing, something that was exacerbated by the rudeness I received and I really didn't appreciate that. \n\nBut again, none of this is in retaliation or because I'm upset. I see something hypocritical, I call it out. \n\nThis whole thing isn't even a personal opinion, you can go to the front page of the sub right now and find multiple posts that break rule 11.\n\nAt this point, I just keep calling out the hypocrisy, not because I'm actually upset. It's almost an inside joke I have with myself. You can try to psychoanalyze my intentions, but I'm sitting here having a great morning, and I don't really even have any ill will specifically against any of the mod team.\n\nAnd I do use the report function on just about every post I comment about this on, specifically because you guys told me to because.\n\nBecause one of the hypocritical things I was told is that the more people who report, the more likely a post will be removed, but my post was only up for 5 minutes at 3am PST. So you're telling me that I had enough people report that post to elicit mod removal, but the rule breaking posts up on the frontpage that are 8 hours old with thousands of comments didn't?\n\nAgain, not upset, I just don't appreciate being jerked around, so I'll call it out. \n\nI get that you guys are human, and I'd probably accept that if  the last time I told you about a post breaking rule 11, you guys said that you have a huge report queue too get through, which again how is it even possible that my post jumped that far up the front of the report queue at 3am after 5 minutes when most mods and english speaking people were asleep?\n\nAgain, I'm not even upset at this point, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy, and at this point it's basically a passtime at this point.\n\nIt would have been nice to have some of the rule 11 breaking top posts removed when reported and called out, at least it would have shown some consistency and integrity. Personally it seems like if it's popular and missed your guy's radar, it's allowed so as to not upset the community who made it a top post. But at that point if you're doing that, why is rule 11 even a rule?\n\nAt the end of the day though, I wouldn't have anything to comment on if Rule 11 was enforced more consistently, or if it wasn't even a rule anymore since 90% of the top posts in this subreddit break rule 11.  \n\n**Beyond all of that, here's an actual suggestion and solution:**\n\nSince this is a meta open forum post, that's why I'm sitting here asking that Rule 11 be enforced more consistently. Or at least have a single day of the week where rule 11 posts are allowed, because it's obvious based on top posts and lack of consistent enforcement that the community doesn't mind these posts. I'd be interested in if in the next meta post you pose the question about rule 11 and see how the community at large feels about it. \n\nAnd it's not much, but it seems I at least have some support since my comment here seems to be controversial.", "I've said it multiple times that I don't really even care about the post anymore. It was months ago and I forgot what it was even about.  \n\nWhat I do remember is the mod team being rude when I didn't understand why multiple popular posts that break rule 11 were allowed, yet mine wasn't and when I was trying to figure out why it was met with unneccessary abrasiveness and rudeness at a time where I was emotionally distressed which was related to the content of the post.\n\nSince then I've just called it out every time I see one of these posts. I wouldn't have anything to comment on if that weren't the case. \n\nSo genuinely, what stuck with me was the rudeness of the mod team, not really the fact my post was deleted.", "How would you interpret a message, weeks after the post removal, that states \u201cNow you guys can start enforcing Rule 11, huh?\u201d? \n\nThat doesn\u2019t read like someone who\u2019s not upset.  That\u2019s the type of message that someone who has an axe to grind sends when it\u2019s time to grind that axe. That\u2019s why the mute is used. \n\nIf you want to be the squeaky wheel, use that report button. Because again, every post and comment that is reported will be reviewed. And if it violates sub rules, it will be removed.  We value good faith reports and Modmail messages  and yours are still welcome. But your messages so far have conveyed otherwise.", "  \n\n\n3AM PST is a pretty quiet time for our sub, so in all likelihood the report queue was really low at that time. You're calling out something that doesn't exist. We don't care how popular a post is, we care if it breaks the rules and if we're made aware of it. 2 reports on a post when we have 300 other reports in our queue will take longer to action than a single report when the queue is mostly empty. Enough reports on a single piece of content will generate a separate modmail message calling it directly to our attention. Your misunderstanding of how moderation works doesn't equate to hypocrisy, it equates to you not properly understanding what you're talking about. \n\nWe're not interested in psychoanalyzing your intention. We're telling you that if you continue to make snarky, passive aggressive comments and send purposefully obnoxious modmails to us for no reason, we're going to continue to treat you like a person who is being purposefully annoying.

Maybe we can help here. It's a little unclear from your comment if your goal is to be a \"squeaky wheel\" and tell the mods they're inconsistent, or if the goal is to gain a better understanding of how and when the rule is enforced.\n\nBut if you're willing to set aside the bad blood that has built between you and some mods and instead ask a question about the rule itself (eg. 'which conflicts involving relationships are removed vs. which conflicts involving relationships are allowed?' or 'how long after reporting a post before a mod looks at it?') That might be the most effective way to get some answers here!  \n\n\nEDIT: Based on your responses to others - It might help to ask yourself what your honest goal is here, and then think about if your comments/actions are supporting that goal, or if that goal is worth it.", "Yeah honestly idk, it probably was just that, I was just surprised as it seemed sorta convenient. I'm sure now it was just that but I wanted to be sure.", "Not all sarcasm is created equal - sarcasm can have different sub-genres if that makes sense. I'd say this is more in the \"snarky\" zone. I'm also on the spectrum, and the two cents I can offer about that particular kind of comment (obviously I'm not privy to the rest of your conversations with the mods) is that \"Now you guys can start enforcing Rule 11, huh?\" is a snarky-sarcastic way of saying \"You are enforcing the rules inconsistently/being unfair.\" And to be fair, per your own admission it's \"sarcastic\", but you also say you mean it and are frustrated by it.\n\nBut of course, understanding that tone can absolutely be misconstrued over the internet (and in real life), I'd focus on asking the specific questions you have about the rules. EG \"My understanding of this part of rule 11 was this - can you explain why that's not the case or where I'm misunderstanding it?\"\n\nI hear that you say the mods have been saying you're upset when you're not, and I know *I've* been in situations where I felt increasingly frustrated after someone perceived me as upset when I didn't intend to come across that way, so I do get how that can spiral into a \"Well *now* I'm upset situation.\" (I can't comment on what was said between y'all that may have caused that disconnect, but assuming everyone is speaking genuinely here, it would of course feel frustrating for all parties involved). Another good thing to keep in mind is both you and the mods are interpreting each other. They interpreted you as upset, and you interpreted them as curt (regardless of either one's intent). It's healthy to keep an awareness of that for all interactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I saw the removal comment saying my post breaks rule 11. My understanding of rule 11 based on the comment and the FAQ was X, can you explain where I'm misunderstanding?\" (It helps if you can be specific here, since the rules, FAQ, and removal comment are all available. If there's a reason none of those resources answer your question, it helps the mods to explain why so they know which part is confusing and know you actually read the rules in the first place. It will also help them answer your question better if they know which part doesn't make sense).\n\n\"I reported X post for breaking rule 11 but it wasn't removed. Is this because the mods haven't seen it yet, or is there a specific reason that post doesn't break rule 11?\"\n\n\"This doesn't make sense\" can absolutely be true to you without being a clear or productive way of getting more information or asking the right question to get clarifying information. If someone tells me my explanation \"doesn't make sense\", I believe them and I want to explain it better, but I need to understand the way it doesn't make sense so I know which part needs to be reworded, or clarified, or give a caveat, etc....\n\nLooking at this conversation we're having on the monthly thread here, reading both your comments, I'm not seeing a question about what rule 11 covers, how it's applied, whether there are exceptions, how it's enforced, etc.... I am only seeing claims that they are not enforcing the rules consistently. Even after my recommendation to ask questions about how the rule is enforced or what it covers, your response includes vague descriptions that the mods wont answer your questions or that the reasons don't make sense. But this is a chance to ask the question, or point to the part that doesn't make sense and say \"can someone explain this part in a different way because I'm not sure I get it?\"\n\n\"Why aren't the rules enforced consistently\" is neither a good faith question nor an attempt to understand the rules, it is expressing a frustration (per your admission) about their modding. If your private messages with them contained similar questions, I understand why they'd eventually disengage and think it was in bad faith. You're both saying that you're not upset and that you are, that you're trying to ask questions about the rule but at the same time haven't said what that question is, just that you're frustrated with inconsistent enforcement.\n\nI'm not saying this to argue, or attack you, but hopefully to explain how the way you're wording these comments is interpreted and why. If your goal is to gain a better understanding, hopefully this helps explain why the mods aren't picking up on it.\n\nBest of luck!

Some people are", "Marinara flag has entered the chat", "Oh and to be clear, I never want to be the person that denies something happens just because it hasn't happened *to me*, so I hope that's not the implication.\n\nSo I do want to start by clarifying that I'm not saying mods have never been rude. I mean, they are human. And sometimes humans are rude, make mistakes, like you said have a bad day, etc... It doesn't mean it's good to be rude by any means, just acknowledging I'm sure that's happened before. Actually, I think I've even seen mods on a monthly thread call out another mod for being uncivil (which is what we can hope for - mods 'modding' each other as well).\n\nWith this particular user based on the other comments....I don't think that's what was going on to be honest.\n\nBut I would also say (and this isn't speculation on your interaction specifically) - If I'm looking at patterns, I have noticed certain common behaviors among users on the sub that, while not necessarily intentionally malicious, are more likely to receive a \"short\" response, which isn't necessarily explicitly rude but rather is to the point and identifies a frustrating or annoying thing a lot of users do in abundance. That short/to the point answer isn't received well, and it escalates from there.\n\nOne example (and again, not saying this is you) is if someone questions why their post was removed without reading the removal reason. Or, even if they did read the reason, simply asking \"I don't understand why my post was removed\" might get a short/to the point response that the user doesn't find helpful and thinks is unnecessarily cold, but at the same time the question isn't particularly helpful, because they were given an initial removal reason, and if they are confused about how that rule applies to their post (which is fair), asking \"why was my post removed\" doesn't get to the bottom of that. If I have a post removed for rule 11, the reason tells me as such, and then I ask \"why was my post removed?\" The mods might say \"It was removed because it broke rule 11.\" That could be frustrating for some because they're thinking \"duh, but why.\" On the mods end, they don't know what they're supposed to explain beyond what the removal, rules, and FAQ say. As far as they know, the user might not understand that the 'partings' part of rule 11 also applies to platonic or family relationships. Or maybe they don't understand that some conflicts featuring a romantic relationship are allowed and others aren't. Or for all the mods know, they didn't read the answer at all. Even if that particular user was acting in good faith and had read it, they get floods of people who *don't* read them, and I'm sure it gets frustrating after awhile.\n\nI also think a lot of people, not just mods but also not excluding mods, have a bias towards thinking they're not being rude and others are. It's easy to think \"I'm just being matter of fact/to the point.\" And then also read someone else being matter of fact and think \"wow, that was curt.\" We know our own intentions and tone, we're interpreting someone else's.\n\nSo I think once either side of an interaction gets a sense that the other side is being hostile, correct or not, it can spiral from there.\n\nAgain, not saying mods could never be rude. But I do suspect they're interpreted as rude more frequently than is accurate or fair. But my take is also that \"short\" answers aren't inherently rude, and they can be warranted. If they get a message for someone who had a post removed for rule 5 and had the removal reason saying so, and they message \"Why was my post removed\" and the mods respond \"There's a removal reason on your post. We recommend you read that first.\" Loads of people will consider that rude or unhelpful. I personally disagree. I think it's both requesting that someone do the bare minimum legwork before asking the mods for a personal explanation, and informing them of where to get the information themselves.\n\nNot saying that's specifically the thing you're talking about, but a lot of the \"wow mods are rude\" perspectives I see are after someone asks a generic question that is easily found on the rules, sidebar, FAQ, or their own removed post, and the mods give a to the point response about where that information is, which we should all at least try to do first, and then if we have specific confusing ask a more precise question. So I think someone would get a more detailed and soft response if they specifically ask \"I thought rule 11 was about romantic relationships and my post didn't have any, is that a misinterpretation?\" or \"My post was removed for rule 5 but I don't understand which part of my post is considered violent, can you explain that?\"  \n\n\nEDIT: I also think sometimes mods are held to this higher standard of being expected to just \"take it\" when people are insulting them or being rude, which I don't think is fair (similar to 'the customer is NOT always right'). So if someone keeps talking about how \"stupid\" it is that a comment of their was removed for being uncivil or insisting that it's unfair that rule 1 is so strict about insults, while mods shouldn't then turn to uncivil insults, I don't think they should be expected to be 'perfectly pleasant' either. So a \"read the rules\" response, or a \"We're not going to let you insult people just because you want to\" might be short, it might not be flowery, but I don't think it crosses a line into unwarranted or uncivil if that makes sense.", "Why does trying to report an AITA post to the mods for containing violence report the user instead to the admins for threatening violence? All I'm trying to do is tell y'all that the post violates rule 5, but I keep getting reports back from Admin stating that they investigated the post and didn't find a threat, and the whole spiel about how I can block the person if I don't want to read their posts.", "Right.  I always wonder about those things when its like \"not everyone is calling and texting me to tell me how awful I was\".  \n\nLike, what?   At best, when you see people they may say something .  I highly doubt you are being bothered on your phone.", "All of that makes sense.  And with there being multiple mods, its kind of hard to make blanket statements. \n\nThat said, again, this sub has a reputation of having pretty crappy mods.  That doesn't come out of nowhere.  They delete posts and ban people VERY easily.   I think there is a combination of things happening, but often it is self inflicted", "This used to confuse me too. Violence reports go to both the Admins and us. We might remove the post before Admins ever see it. And admittedly, we take a very strict stance on violence in this sub. But it's an automatic thing where violence reports are forwarded to them as well.", "we sadly have zero control over this. Reddit automatically forwards any/all violence reports at the sub level to the admins. thank you for continuing to report things despite the annoyance!!!"]}
