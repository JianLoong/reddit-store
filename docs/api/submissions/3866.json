This is the place to share all your meta thoughts about the sub, and to have a dialogue with the mod team.\n\n\n#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\nDecember is already underway, with year-end holidays fast-approaching! We thought we'd do a quick recap of our monthly deep dives this past year.\n\n[January - Rule 3 reporting change](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rtvtft/aita_monthly_open_forum_january_2022/)\n\n[February - Rule 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/si07tp/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2022/)\n\n[March - Rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t4eh7s/aita_monthly_open_forum_march_2022/)\n\n[April - Rule 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tunibp/aita_monthly_open_forum_april_2022/)\n\n[May - Moderating the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uh5wgn/aita_monthly_open_forum_may_2022/)\n\n[June - Rule 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v2irhy/aita_monthly_open_forum_june_2022/)\n\n[July - Judgment Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vozn9i/aita_monthly_open_forum_july_2022/)\n\n[August - General FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wdhrop/aita_monthly_open_forum_august_2022/)\n\n[September - Rule 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x399by/aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2022/)\n\n[October - Rule 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xt1ksm/aita_monthly_open_forum_spooktober_2022/)\n\n[November - Rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj9wlq/aita_monthly_open_forum_november_2022_civility/)\n\nI'm sure there will be questions, since it's almost that time - we will have something about the yearly Best-Of in next month's Open Forum. \n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\nWe always need mods for the US overnight hours. Currently, we could also definitely benefit from mods active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mood tools are improving and trickling in, but not quite there yet.\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.\n\n---\n\nWe'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar! If you have any suggestions or additions to this please let us know in the comments.", "created_utc": 1670100606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbqapd/aita_monthly_open_forum_december_2022/", "score": 4, "replies": ["I'd love to assist with the moderation, but I already have my hands full on the one subreddit I'm taking care of haha.  \n\n\nBut I've really been enjoying my time back in the subreddit and I do thank the mods for giving me a second chance to prove myself here :)"]}
