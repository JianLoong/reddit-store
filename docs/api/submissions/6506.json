I understand why she would hide her personal information from you if there were issues, but moving in together takes that piece of the equation away and she should have opened up and been honest.  Is it kind to look into each others history?  No...it really isn't.  She looked into your history for whatever reason she had (I've done it and my gut instinct was RIGHT) and you looked into hers and YOU were right.  So you both have an extra peak into one another's lives...what to do with it is the next step.", "NTA, though I hate saying it.\n\nThe key thing for me is the bit \"i was cool with it\" when talking about your police records.  If you weren't okay with that and went behind her back, YWBTA.  If she researched you, it's fair for you to research her.\n\nThat being said, your relationship is toxic, fucked up and doomed.  You both should consider ending things now, or go into counseling together.", "NTA- but dude, if the girl wont talk about her finances like that DONT move in with her.  Dont need to pull her credit reports for that.  If two people who are in a relationship can't talk openly and honesty about their spending habits, then dont be with that person.", "ESH. If you don't trust her, don't move in with her. Going behind her to see if you can trust her only shows she can't trust you in return, even if you like what you find.\n\nEdit: \"got my police records (like the one they ask for jobs) without telling me back when we started dating\"\n\nTotally missed this, changed to ESH. You two are perfect for each other.", "NTA.  You have a right to know what you're getting into.", "Sweetheart this is not the relationship for either of you, time to split up and move on.", "ESH. You guys can\u2019t even trust each other enough to tell each other your past faults. Don\u2019t move in together. This is going to end badly.", "ESH. It might not be illegal but it\u2019s certainly not a thing to do behind your partner\u2018s back.\n\nI would also argue that trying to find out if someone had a past with violence is more justifiable than trying to dig in someone\u2019s finances.", "NTA.  If anything, considering her coyness about the topic, it was the responsible thing to do on your part.", "NTA \nYou you guys are not ready to live together. You need to work on your communication first. \n\nThere is there\u2019s no way you can live together without being open and honest about your debt and budgets and since she\u2019s not ready to have those conversations, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready for a co-living situation", "NTA. This may be a controversial take--I don't know--but I think you had a right to know what you were getting into financially before you moved in with her. Besides, given the police report thing she really doesn't have a leg to stand on, here.", "ESH. When you're with someone, you're supposed to trust each other and communicate. You're worried about her spending habits? You talk to her. She doesn't want to talk about them? You tell her you don't accept that; it's very important you have this conversation. She still doesn't want to talk about them? Well, you now have to decide if you accept that or not. Do you trust her or not?\n\nInstead of communicating, you went behind her back and took her information without her knowledge. Yes, it's legal in your country. Chances are adultery is legal in your country too; does that mean you can be an adulterer and she can't get angry?

Also damn... yeah that's a double standard alright.", "ESH.\n\nYou two have poor communication with each other.

If your relationship requires background checks, criminal records and various reports, I think you have far more critical issues than credit.", "ESH. \n\nYou did go behind her back but you only did that because she wasn't being honest with you.

It's fine to mutually agree to go over your credit reports together and decide as a couple whether it makes sense to move forward. \n\nAs for the criminal background check \u2014 I'll give that a N T A for her with the caveat that you would have been justified doing the same early in a relationship.

Before getting serious in a relationship, especially if kids are in the picture, swap background checks.  Before moving in and becoming financially vulnerable with someone, get a credit report.

It's a little weird that your GF got your police record/background check on you, but she's not an AH for doing that since a lot of people, girls especially do check these sorts of things as a means of being sure about their partners. Where she becomes the AH though, is being a hypocrite now about it, and also actively lying and trying to hide her financial health from you. And unlike her, you did not immediately go behind her back to get that information. You rightly asked her for it, but she refused, and only then did you seek out her financial records, through legal means. People saying E-S-H or even calling you an AH are being blinded by the sentiment of \"trust your partner\" or some variation of that, which is bonkers to me. Trust is a two way street, and when she refused to give you more information, you either had to get that information for yourself, or be a sucker who would later wind up in some sort of financial ruin otherwise. You made the smart move, and now you not only have to decide if moving together with her is a good idea, but if the relationship itself is a good idea. If she is willing to essentially lie about this and then proceed to get angry with you, how sure are you she won't do this again? I'm almost certain these sorts of double standards from her won't be an isolated incident.", "NTA \n\nShe got your criminal record to make her feel safe. I\u2019m assuming. \n\nYou got her financial records before making a financial commitment with her. Actually not a bad idea. \n\nOr do a prenup and keep finances very separate until you are comfortable with her spending", "NAH. \n\nThe double standard in these comments is a little crazy. I think if roles were reversed and it were a woman trying to make sure she was financially protected, most people would be ok with the credit report. Just my opinion, and you didn\u2019t do anything illegal. \n\nBUT I can also see how it might come off as an invasion of financial privacy to her if you guys weren\u2019t planning to combine assets. As long as you were staying financially independent and splitting 50/50 it shouldn\u2019t impact you any more than it would to have any other roommate. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think anyone was TA but you guys should consider seeing a therapist to work through your financial anxiety, the spending habits you are concerned about, and what she perceived as an invasion of privacy on your part.", "NTA. I don't understand the negative judgements here ... If she's not willing to communicate, it's reasonable that you'd protect yourself by checking her out. That said, the fact that (a) you guys don't seem to be communicating and (b) you're concerned by what you learned about her finances and (c) checking the credit report of someone with whom you're in an intimate relationship just seems icky, I don't think your relationship is at the moving in together stage.", "NTA.

Probably her refusing should have been enough to throw off the plan to move in together.", "NTA, she wanted to know if you were safe, you wanted to know if she was stable. (And she ain't) So yeah. Good luck.", "NTA. You\u2019d have ended up paying for everything when she guilted you and tried to use her downstairs kitty cat magic to manipulate you to make it seem like it\u2019s ok.", "NTA it's totally irresponsible of her to move in with you and hide her financial problems. I've been dating a woman for a year now, but I went back to college 2 years ago and I told her straight up I wasn't going to enter any financial partnerships with her until I finish school and get a new job.

If she can \u201cviolate your privacy\u201d to do a police background check on you, without consent or knowledge than you have every right to do the same thing to her about her finances. Especially since she refuses to talk about it. The last thing you want or need is to move in with someone who can\u2019t afford their contribution. It\u2019s also a good thing to be aware of before you get married if it were to lead to that. Her finances could have long term effects on you.", "NTA because she refused to answer her questions. She should have been open and honest when you asked.", "N\nXL Lou", "ESH.\n\nIt might be legal, but it's not cool.\n\nBut she did basically the same thing to you in getting police records, so she has no business complaining really.", "YTA to slight E S H\n\nAs best as she could, she made sure you didn't have a past of raping/abusing women *at the start of your relationship*. You seem to understand that and know she isn't an AH for keeping herself safe. YTA for thinking of moving in and yet not trusting her enough to go behind her back. She. Should have communicated to you (why it is a bit of E S H) but when she didn't, the move is to decide if that is reason enough to end thw relationship, not go behind her back. Not really sure either of you are ready for a relationship tbh.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t move in with her if she doesn\u2019t wanna talk finances, and she should be understanding that you DO want to talk about these things. However, pulling a credit report is wild and if I\u2019m not mistaken can actually count against the credit as a soft pull? \nBut y\u2019all should not be together if you can\u2019t be honest with each other so", "ESH. Y'all are 100% not ready to move in together.", "ESH\nCredit report:  You should have totally asked her first, and offered to share yours with her.  If she refused, well, you wouldn't even need the report anymore, would you? Relationships require trust.\n\nYour police record:  Yeah, she was an AH for doing that without telling you.  She should have offered to do it for each other as with credit reports.  \n\nDouble standards: Yeah, at some level, she doesn't get to complain about violating her trust, since she did it to you.  BUT, both of you being distrustful AHs doesn't make for a healthy relationship.", "ESH. Y\u2019all are not cut out to be in a relationship. When you stoop to running covert background / credit checks on one another, just end it.", "YTA no double standard. You are both TA.", "Lol nah. Bad take. Making sure that someone is financially stable is 110% justifiable. When I live with someone I\u2019m not trying to put myself at risk because someone else likes to spend money. Especially not a significant other.", "Lol at sexim, that's irrelevant here. I started with good faith but i lost it after several months of watching her spending and hearing her talk about her credit card debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>If she was a man would you have done that?\n\nYES! With the key difference that everyone here would have told me that was the right thing to do.", "\\>You seem to understand that and know she isn't an AH for keeping herself safe.\n\nSure, and i dint' get mad at her for going behind my back. That was the sensible thing to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>the move is to decide if that is reason enough to end thw relationship, not go behind her back. \n\nShouldn't she have done the same thing instead of getting my police records behind my back? I don't get the double standard.", "Agreed u/Boddokki you should not move in with someone (especially with a lease involved) that is shady with their financials.\n\nSource: Got out of a live-in relationship with someone that told me they ran their own company, but was actually unemployed and faking working from home. They work in the service industry now (zero shade don\u2019t get it twisted! but a lie nonetheless). \n\nSeparating our finances and the poor investments he recommended to me was a nightmare that I wouldn\u2019t wish on OP or anyone yeesh", "Yeah i'd say NTA, when your partner is lying to you especially when it impacts future decisions like renting a place together or getting a joint bank account, it's reasonable to protect yourself and your sanity. Saying otherwise is irresponsible and is hostile to someone who might otherwise been taken advantage of. It is good for his wellbeing to know that he was correct in trusting his intuition.\n\nThough now that he has found out the truth, it's best to just end the relationship than try to mend something that likely won't improve.", "But if he didn't trust her, then the non-AH course of action would be *to not move in with her* , not get a credit report on her behind her back. While the latter is supposedly legal, it's still a weird breach of trust (again, I agree he shouldn't have trusted her, but he should have taken that as a cue to just not cohabitate/merge finances).", "I feel like y'all are forgetting the very existant option of just not moving in with her if she refuses to be upfront about her financial situation. Like that's how he should have handled this and would have been the appropriate response.", "Honestly this is just one of those questions that's just too hard to actually answer due to not having any context on the chemistry between you two.\n\nUltimately you already know she has a big spending problem and probably fucked credit.  You don't really need to sneak a credit report.\n\n You can either accept it and hope she changes (things take time) or cut and run right now.    Never know man.   My wife had horrible credit and debts when we met. Took her a while but she got it paid off while I picked up the slack on monthly bills and all's good.  \\*still have my own bank account though I'm not an idiot.", "Yep. It wasn't illegal. You made the right move.", "> in a productive way. \n\nShe didn't engage, so you took the immature step of snooping rather than ending the relationship.", "Wait... so you can get tied to a known abuser but gotta watch out for that credit score?! What kind of system is that? I think it's far more important to lessen the threat of domestic violence than bad credit. I mean both are bad but one can be fatal.", "Agreed, you don\u2019t want to spend your entire relationship worried that your SO is lying about finances", ">But if he didn't trust her, then the non-AH course of action would be to not move in with her, not get a credit report on her behind her back.\n\ni still don't get why this applies to me and not to her too.\n\n\"if she didn't trust him, the non-AH course of action would be to not date him, not get a police record on him behind his back\"", "I mean he could have but chose this route.
