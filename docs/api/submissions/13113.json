Our family does not support her decisions, but I don\u2019t give a f*ck who she sleeps with. When she came out she was distanced from the family, but we started talking again after finding out our father is dying.*\n\nAfter things in the family being rocky for a long time we decided to all get together at my parents house. My dad said he wanted to put all of the drama and bickering aside, and if we have a problem with each other we can wait until he passes. Everyone agrees, including my sister, so I was expecting to have a nice family BBQ. My family wanted to meet my sister\u2019s girlfriend, and insisted that she brought her over. We were all excited to meet her. \n\n My sister\u2019s girlfriend seemed like a nice girl, but she was very stand off-ish. She kept to herself, and didn\u2019t speak much to my parents and me. For the most part she was glued to my sister. This caused some awkward silence. I started asking about their relationship. How did they meet, how long have they been together, and I even joked around about if she hurt my sister *blah blah blah.* My parents started acting stranger by each question. I asked my mom what was wrong, and her response was:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d \n\nI could tell my sister and her girlfriend were uncomfortable, and my dad tried to calm my mom down. My sister, probably fed up with being treated like sh*t for the last few years, spoke up and asked my parents what was the point of inviting them if she wasn\u2019t going to be okay with seeing them together. \n\nThis caused my mother to explode with anger because she felt like my sister was being disrespectful. My mother goes onto say a lot of other things (that I\u2019m not going to say because I will be banned \ud83d\ude05). My sister started to cry and hyperventilate. Her girlfriend starts to comfort her and tries to get her to calm down, and this causes my mom to tell her that \u201cif you\u2019re going to be dramatic and act like a child, you need to leave. You\u2019re upsetting your father.\u201d Before my sister could respond her girlfriend is grabbing their things and taking my sister to the car. \n\nI tried to rationalize this whole situation with my parents, they were no use. They thought she was putting on a show in front of her girlfriend to make them look bad. They proceeded to say that they\u2019re allowed to be uncomfortable, and feel differently than her. I explained to them that this is who she loves. No one has to agree with it, but we should still love her. I\u2019ve tried talking to my sister about the whole situation, and apparently I *defend our parents too much.* I told her that our parents don\u2019t *have* to agree with her relationship, but they should. She told me that I\u2019m being an asshole for expecting her to pretend it\u2019s be someone else just because our dad is dying. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679691810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120ylm1/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_our_parents_dont/", "score": 3143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad was sticking to his best of trying to look past his antiquated views and having a good time, but your mother decided to start up some drama with homophobic comments.

His sister can: -\n\n1. Choose to conform to her parents' ideals and probably be horrendously unhappy (aka living a lie)\n\nOr\n\n2. Be true to herself and love the person who she falls in love with and live a loving and emotionally healthy life.\n\nOf course, choice 2 is the right thing to do but you can't answer that question until you are in that person's shoes. \n\nAlso, it is clear that OP was not intending to over-trivialise homosexuality.", "To be fair to the 9 people, it could also be an intervention", "OP is the type to put a glass at the edge of the table just hoping someone else knocks it over.", "Ah, I see. I\u2019m very happy that my sister has found someone who loves and cares about her. They seem very in love and her girlfriend treats her very well (from what Ive seen). A lot of my comments came from a place of hurt, confusion, and defensiveness. That\u2019s no excuse. I see now that I was being unfair for judging my sister\u2019s girlfriend for taking her out of the situation. It\u2019s probably what she needed. I was too ignorant to think that this could have been a trauma response from my sister, and she wasn\u2019t trying to ruin anything.

I don\u2019t think she needs to apologize for being who she is, and I don\u2019t want her to. I can see how I\u2019ve been an asshole in all of this, and this isn\u2019t fair to either side.

I\u2019m really sorry to hear about you family, and I hope you guys can reconcile at some point.", "And the fact that you are still defending your parents and your comments, goes to show that you agree with them more than you do with her. Think about that. Think about what your actions are directly showing your sister. Think about how what you said to her, made her feel. This is not about your feelings, or about your parents feelings. This is about her, and what the hell you guys have been doing to her for years that made her have a panic attack to the point where she was hyperventilating and had to be removed from the situation. Think about how much disdain you guys must have for her, that your mother decided to throw her out for having a reasonable reaction to homophobia directly in her face. Think about how much therapy you should get, in order to unpack your own homophobia. Because you are not an ally here. You are acting in the exact opposite way that we would need allies to act.

I especially agree with whatever commenter pointed out that she's losing her dad too - emotions are definitely running high right now and your sister's relationship with your dad *must* have been important to her if she was willing to put herself back in the line of fire like this.\n\n>Just because I wouldn\u2019t do what her girlfriend did doesn\u2019t make her wrong, nor does it make me wrong. We\u2019re just different people. \n\nJust on this point quickly, I agree with you that obviously different people react different ways, but consider your sister's girlfriend may have been defensive because she's had to be before. Coming into a situation where you know your partner's parents have been openly homophobic to them is already really challenging, because here's a person you love *so much*, and you're walking into an environment where you know the people there have let them down. It's hard not to be defensive from the get-go. But it's so much harder still if *your* family has been the same way, and you're already used to needing to defend your identity everywhere you go. Sometimes, being openly out just kind of takes a toll on you. You get edgy about the fact that you're constantly looking over your shoulder, or waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nAs for my own family, if you'd like some hope, I have a surprisingly decent relationship with everyone now.  It's not, and probably never will be, as uncomplicated as it was when I was younger, but it's relatively stable, and for now, I can work with that. \n\nI know I'm just one person on this post, but even if I did believe YTA coming into it, I do really hope you and your sister can sort it out in the end. For her sake too - sure, going NC with your family can be *a* solution, but it's rarely the solution anyone actually *wants*. The fact that she was even willing to try and reconcile with your father demonstrates that much. There's a lot of unlearning for anyone who's grown up in a homophobic household, but it's not impossible for anyone. Good luck to her, and to you. With a mother like that, you'll need it.", "another key is that you call her girlfriend stand-offish for clinging to your sister, but theres a chance that she was just.. shy. Any time im meeting a friend/partners family i definitely end up clinging to them, at first, too, because they act like a bridge between me and these complete strangers as the only thing we have in common until we're able to connect past a superficial \"so how about the weather\" level.  \n\nAlternatively,  it's possible that shes not shy at all, but *protective*, and knows that this family has hurt your sister-- someone she loves dearly-- on a level that she might never fully recover from in her life (even if your mom did a 180 tomorrow and fully accepted her, the trauma would still be there. it sits very deep within your psyche when your own mother hates you for something inherent to your self) and she didnt want to leave your sister alone and defenseless. Her priority wasnt to mingle and have fun, but to support your sister in her attempt to repair the bonds that were broken before it was too late. When your mom exploded on your sister for nothing, her girlfriend's focus was on keeping her from falling apart entirely and help her get out as soon as possible. \n\nLook up statistics of self harm (and worse) among queer people rejected by their families and thank your lucky stars that your sister had her girlfriend there. You're already losing a dad, and thats tragic and unimaginable and im terribly sorry that youre going through that, but you dont want to lose your sister too. \n\nGood job on the self reflection, though,  man. its refreshing to see.

I take it that your mother wasn't on board with the idea - she seems to have no concern for anyone's feelings, including your father's.  You said 'My sister asked my parents what was the point of inviting them if SHE wasn't going to accept them?\", which was a perfectly reasonable question.  So it doesn't seem that your father was the problem.

Would she be willing to go visit someone so that your father could say goodbye to your sister in peace?  You can point out that you can't change your mother's mind, but I hope that you don't try to defend such behavior.\n\nYour sister did a brave thing by coming to see her family with her GF after all that has gone on, and I'm not surprised that she was extremely upset - she trusted her family, and your mother betrayed her.\n\nYou're in a tough spot.  You feel that you have to take care of your mother, but I hope that you will try to maintain a relationship with your sister and her GF as well.  Surely you can visit each other at your homes, or go out to dinner or a movie. If your mother objects, I hope that you can shut her down.

In this way, it\u2019s not a fair comparison to OPs situation, or the situation for most people today choosing not to speak out against racism/ableism/homophobia/transphobia/xenophobia/any other discrimination or hateful views when finding themselves surrounded by people who believe those things. \n\nWorst case his family, including his dying father will cut him out of their life\u2026. But probably not considering they haven\u2019t even actually done that to their daughter and if they did they would find themselves with no children (assuming there is not another sibling that hasn\u2019t been mentioned here, which would be odd) and before long the mum would find herself with absolutely nobody. It\u2019s much more likely that the pressure of both of their children would shift their views a bit. \n\nEither way, OP is in absolutely no fear of the secret police turning up and smashing his door in publicly in the middle of the night to drag him away somewhere for being an \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 if he stands up for what\u2019s right. \n\nWhen people fear for their own lives, the comparison of whether they did or did not stand up for what was right becomes quite a bit more complicated, and I don\u2019t know that any of us could say with 100% certainty that we know how we would behave in those circumstances and that under risk of brutal torture and death that we would be the one at the dinner table to stick our head above the parapet. \n\nThe replacement of \u2018nazi\u2019 with \u2018bigot\u2019 as suggested above makes this a much more on par comparison/saying that should be more relatable to most people in terms of them understanding what not speaking out for what\u2019s right actually says about what/who they are too.\n\nEdit: it is very clear though that OP is absolutely not accepting of his sisters \u2018choices\u2019 and is doing the bare minimum to accept it whilst absolutely nothing to stand up for what is right here.", "Or maybe you can just not judge how people view their sexuality.", ">I wanted some reassurance, but now I see that I have just as much fault in this situation as my parents.\n\nThat's a good sign, actually. You had that little doubt, the little voice that questioned if you were doing things right. And looking at how you've finally come around, it looks like it's alive and well. I hope you can continue to grow as a person.\n\nThat said I wouldn't be surprised if your sister never wants to speak with you again. You can reach out and apologize and explain that you realize you've been wrong all along, but please don't insist if she tells you not to contact her anymore.\n\nI for one hope that the two of you can reconnect and you can finally be an ally to her, but the damage may already be done.", "> I was expecting everyone to agree that I wasn\u2019t an asshole in this situation.\n\nHow? You are playing the middleman between a bigot and a victim. You are not as bad as your mother but you are faaaaaaar from being redeemable in this situation.", "That's not what I said, and seeing as you are looking for some sort of homophobic conspiracy in my words, I'll rephrase.\n\nHis sister is right to be true to herself and love who she loves. The alternative is living a lie and being unhappy just to satisfy her parents. IMO, nobody should dictate your lovelife, but it's not a simple world, and many people choose to live a lie for their own reasons, and that is for them to decide alone.\n\nClear enough?", "That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. We all choose our actions. Just because one homophobe tries to use that idea to justify their terrible beliefs doesn\u2019t change reality. \n\nYou can\u2019t just pretend like our decisions are predetermined because it makes someone else\u2019s irrational beliefs invalid.", "I don't give a shit if you have a fuck buddy but if you're in a relationship that isn't a fuck buddy is it?", "I hope I can grow, too. I wouldn\u2019t blame my sister if she never wanted to speak to me again. Looking at the situation from her perspective, I probably wouldn\u2019t. The things our mother said to her were outrageous, and I doubt they\u2019re things she\u2019ll forget. I should have stood up for my sister as soon as the argument started, but I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure she associates my silence with agreement. I hope she gives me the chance to apologize to her. If she chooses not to, I\u2019ll respect that. I wish things didn\u2019t have to go this far for me to realize this, but being blasted online really does open your eyes!", "You literally said in your previous reply \u201cacting on it is the choice\u201d. Sorry I don\u2019t have telepathy to understand that you meant something else to the exact thing that you wrote.", "Damn after reading all the other defensive comments you made I didn't expect this kind of self reflection, fair play to you man, hope you try and do right by your sister more in the future", "Your sister made a huge effort and she ended up attacked by your mother. Your dying father wanted to connect with his daughter, and your mother hijacked and ruined the evening. \n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for your mother\u2019s hateful and vile behavior. If your mother cannot support her husband\u2019s desire to connect with their daughter, she should remove herself from the situation. \n\nWhat your mother did and her behavior is wrong on so many levels. Her homophobia and vicious attacks on your sister are not something your sister needs to accept or endure. What your sister may need to accept is that your mother is irredeemable and will never be anything less than hateful. \n\nYou have normalized and accepted your parents\u2019 behavior and homophobia. That\u2019s not to say you like or support it, but you seem to have believed your sister should tolerate it and be the bigger person. Your sister\u2019s sexuality is not a choice. However, your parents\u2019 (and particularly your mother) *choose* to behave in an appalling way because of what they *choose* to oppose.\n\nYou are not to blame - anymore than your sister - for your mother\u2019s behavior. But it\u2019s clear that you tragically failed to read the room. Your attempts to talk about your sister\u2019s relationship in a jokey way were ill advised. You likely wanted everyone to get along and failed to understand how much hate your mother held and how selfishly and cruelly she\u2019d behave. \n\nThere will come a time (if it hasn\u2019t already) when you will have to choose between your mother and sister. Choose your sister.", "I feel like I didn\u2019t have an issue understanding his comment.  They were speaking in terms of OP\u2019s sister inconveniencing their own life to appease their parents or just be themselves.  \n\nReads like you got caught up on the word \u201cchoice\u201d like a dog with a bone.  Obviously choice has no bearing in one\u2019s sexual orientation.  We\u2019re decades past that notion.", "I was very defensive and harsh in the beginning, but when someone pointed out that my sister is losing our father too and probably feels like she\u2019s losing both parents it really stuck with me. Especially since our mother is adamant on not supporting her. It\u2019s really a shitty situation to be in at any age, but I forget she\u2019s only 21. At 21 I was doing so much worse than dating someone of the same sex. My sister is a good girl, and at the end of the day I just want her to be happy. I will definitely make an effort to stand by my sister more in the future. As much as I love my parents, I can\u2019t allow something like this to keep happening if I want reunification."]}
