Our family does not support her decisions, but I don\u2019t give a f*ck who she sleeps with. When she came out she was distanced from the family, but we started talking again after finding out our father is dying.*\n\nAfter things in the family being rocky for a long time we decided to all get together at my parents house. My dad said he wanted to put all of the drama and bickering aside, and if we have a problem with each other we can wait until he passes. Everyone agrees, including my sister, so I was expecting to have a nice family BBQ. My family wanted to meet my sister\u2019s girlfriend, and insisted that she brought her over. We were all excited to meet her. \n\n My sister\u2019s girlfriend seemed like a nice girl, but she was very stand off-ish. She kept to herself, and didn\u2019t speak much to my parents and me. For the most part she was glued to my sister. This caused some awkward silence. I started asking about their relationship. How did they meet, how long have they been together, and I even joked around about if she hurt my sister *blah blah blah.* My parents started acting stranger by each question. I asked my mom what was wrong, and her response was:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d \n\nI could tell my sister and her girlfriend were uncomfortable, and my dad tried to calm my mom down. My sister, probably fed up with being treated like sh*t for the last few years, spoke up and asked my parents what was the point of inviting them if she wasn\u2019t going to be okay with seeing them together. \n\nThis caused my mother to explode with anger because she felt like my sister was being disrespectful. My mother goes onto say a lot of other things (that I\u2019m not going to say because I will be banned \ud83d\ude05). My sister started to cry and hyperventilate. Her girlfriend starts to comfort her and tries to get her to calm down, and this causes my mom to tell her that \u201cif you\u2019re going to be dramatic and act like a child, you need to leave. You\u2019re upsetting your father.\u201d Before my sister could respond her girlfriend is grabbing their things and taking my sister to the car. \n\nI tried to rationalize this whole situation with my parents, they were no use. They thought she was putting on a show in front of her girlfriend to make them look bad. They proceeded to say that they\u2019re allowed to be uncomfortable, and feel differently than her. I explained to them that this is who she loves. No one has to agree with it, but we should still love her. I\u2019ve tried talking to my sister about the whole situation, and apparently I *defend our parents too much.* I told her that our parents don\u2019t *have* to agree with her relationship, but they should. She told me that I\u2019m being an asshole for expecting her to pretend it\u2019s be someone else just because our dad is dying. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679691810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120ylm1/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_our_parents_dont/", "score": 495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You all insisted on having this BBQ, saying there would be no drama and bickering, and wanted your sister to bring her girlfriend. Then you all didn\u2019t like that her girlfriend was standoffish, but did it ever occur to you that maybe that would be because your sister told her gf that your parents don\u2019t like that she\u2019s gay? You have also painted yourself to be indifferent to the situation, so it\u2019s possible that your sister doesn\u2019t see you as being supportive of her being queer either. At least from this post you have not proven to defend your sister and your indifference can be read as siding with your parents.

Sure, they're from a different generation that doesn't understand how sexuality can work, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't try to understand.

Your dad was sticking to his best of trying to look past his antiquated views and having a good time, but your mother decided to start up some drama with homophobic comments. Your sister and her girlfriend were being shamed and panicking, and your dad probably isn't in the state to be acting as a mediator.

They don\u2019t get a pass to insult your sister just because they can use widely accepted excuses. You shouldn\u2019t ask her to suck it up because her being respected is just as valuable as anyone else in that room, and, the most important part of this, is that they have every right to feel uncomfortable with her life choices but that\u2019s wildly different than being allowed to use that discomfort to insult her the way you described.", "YTA\n\nSo you are choosing between your sister and the inheritance you are expecting from your parents.

THEY didn't \"upset your father,\" SHE did by assuming the perfectly normal interaction you were having with them was them \"being disrespectful.\" Their lesbian relationship does not disrespect her except in her own mind.\n\nYou could be more in their corner talking to your sister afterwards. \n\nSorry your father is sick.", "So your mother instigated drama?

Certain religious beliefs are warped. But I will say this. At least religious people are trying to think in terms of what is moral or not (misguided as many can be).

What is the parents\u2019 problem if their attitude is not driven by religion? How can you argue that stance when religion isn\u2019t a factor?
