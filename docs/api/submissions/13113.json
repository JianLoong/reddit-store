Our family does not support her decisions, but I don\u2019t give a f*ck who she sleeps with. When she came out she was distanced from the family, but we started talking again after finding out our father is dying.*\n\nAfter things in the family being rocky for a long time we decided to all get together at my parents house. My dad said he wanted to put all of the drama and bickering aside, and if we have a problem with each other we can wait until he passes. Everyone agrees, including my sister, so I was expecting to have a nice family BBQ. My family wanted to meet my sister\u2019s girlfriend, and insisted that she brought her over. We were all excited to meet her. \n\n My sister\u2019s girlfriend seemed like a nice girl, but she was very stand off-ish. She kept to herself, and didn\u2019t speak much to my parents and me. For the most part she was glued to my sister. This caused some awkward silence. I started asking about their relationship. How did they meet, how long have they been together, and I even joked around about if she hurt my sister *blah blah blah.* My parents started acting stranger by each question. I asked my mom what was wrong, and her response was:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d \n\nI could tell my sister and her girlfriend were uncomfortable, and my dad tried to calm my mom down. My sister, probably fed up with being treated like sh*t for the last few years, spoke up and asked my parents what was the point of inviting them if she wasn\u2019t going to be okay with seeing them together. \n\nThis caused my mother to explode with anger because she felt like my sister was being disrespectful. My mother goes onto say a lot of other things (that I\u2019m not going to say because I will be banned \ud83d\ude05). My sister started to cry and hyperventilate. Her girlfriend starts to comfort her and tries to get her to calm down, and this causes my mom to tell her that \u201cif you\u2019re going to be dramatic and act like a child, you need to leave. You\u2019re upsetting your father.\u201d Before my sister could respond her girlfriend is grabbing their things and taking my sister to the car. \n\nI tried to rationalize this whole situation with my parents, they were no use. They thought she was putting on a show in front of her girlfriend to make them look bad. They proceeded to say that they\u2019re allowed to be uncomfortable, and feel differently than her. I explained to them that this is who she loves. No one has to agree with it, but we should still love her. I\u2019ve tried talking to my sister about the whole situation, and apparently I *defend our parents too much.* I told her that our parents don\u2019t *have* to agree with her relationship, but they should. She told me that I\u2019m being an asshole for expecting her to pretend it\u2019s be someone else just because our dad is dying. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679691810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120ylm1/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_our_parents_dont/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The drama is caused by your mom because she\u2019s homophobic, sure you can\u2019t change your moms perspective but you can stand up for your sister and you can remind your mom that your dad doesn\u2019t want drama. Your mom started it, your sister was simply the victim and was obviously really hurt. You guys also asked her to bring her Gf and then a huge issue was made out of that. How is she at fault in any way??? She was just trying to make everyone happy for your dad like you asked and then was targeted??? And you stood there and did nothing and are now complaining about how she reacted. Maybe if you would have stood up for her and supported her she wouldn\u2019t have gotten as upset as she did???", "Yes, because I know my family doesn\u2019t accept my sister because of sexuality.

It could have stopped after my mom opened her mouth and caused drama, but my sister wouldn\u2019t let that happen. I understand that she was upset, and I do think my mom went way too far. \n\nI don\u2019t see why it had to be so dramatized. If she was about to cry she could have excused herself instead of making our father have to witness another family fight when he\u2019s about to pass. Instead she freaked out and her girlfriend sat there trying to comfort her for a good two minutes before anyone said anything else. \n\nIt\u2019s just hard to see your dying father upset because our family can\u2019t get along. If you haven\u2019t been through *this* you won\u2019t understand.", "I think the hyperventilating and sobbing was ver dramatic. I understand her being upset for sure, but my dad didn\u2019t deserve the drama.", "Being gay. Don't you know they all do it for attention? /S", "I am open minded, but I\u2019m not my mother.

We\u2019re being nasty. And so are you. \n\nYou expect your sister to behave *perfectly* despite having the people who *should* love her most being absolutely abhorrent to her. \n\nYou have betrayed your sister.  And so have your parents. \n\nShe owes you all *nothing*. Not good manners or civility. Not excusing herself to cry because your mom is being evil so you don\u2019t get your underwear in a twist.\n\n**edited to add: if you and your dad and mom wanted your sister to behave while he was dying, perhaps you should treat your sister better.  You reap what you sow, and you and your parents have sowed an epic titanic level of bigotry and hate. Go stew in it.**", "You state that your mom *caused* the drama. Why are you so adamant that this is not your moms fault? Why is it okay for your mom to start it, but not okay for your sister to continue? Yes, your sister knows how your parents are.

I do not understand your perpetual instinct to protect the wrong person.", "You might claim to support your sister, but you are as bad as your mother, and I hope your sister goes no contact with all of you again ASAP because none of this is worth what you all are putting her through.", "Your mother caused the drama, acted like an ass and (once again) humiliated your sister but somehow it's your sister's fault for ruinning the party ? You didn't come here to ask for judgement you came here for validation and to vilainize your sister.

Sister dudged a bullet !!\n\nEdit : the way you put a smiley to downplay your mother's homophobic rant, just say everything we need to know about you. You're not the white knight you think you are, you don't support yoir sister in any ways. I'd say, at least, your mother is upfront about her homophobia.  You on the other hand are just a hypocrite \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Again you have not be treated badly because of your sexuality she has. You dont know how hurt she is. She came because you asked her and she kept her end of the bargain your mom did not and the person you need to put in line is your mother not your sister. \n\nYour sister is not dating an abuser she is dating a woman and your parents hate that and your mom couldnt hold back. Why is she allowed to have a go at your sister.", "Stop blaming your sister, she did absolutely nothing wrong. Your mum started and continued this. This is all on her, not your sister. Your mum couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut for the sake of your father. No one should have to sit and take abuse, no one should be blamed for being upset when they are being insulted and humiliated for just being themselves. You\u2019re so set on not rocking the boat and trying to get everyone to get along you\u2019re literally ignoring the person stopping that and blaming someone who is completely innocent. You\u2019re on about going NC with her after your father dies because your mum is too homophobic to be nice, because she cried at being insulted by her mum after promising to keep the peace and you deem that drama, that makes you undoubtedly the asshole.

But of course you didn't do that !\n\nWhat you don't understand is that your sister was devasted and mentally broke down when she REALIZED the person who birthed her and who was supposed to love her unconditionally will never love her. For a child of any age this revelation is ground breaking. \n\nThe fact that strangers on the internet were more understanding of your sister's pain and feel more emphaty towards her than **her own freaking family** should tell you everything about yourself. What I will never understand is why people like you parents bring kids into the world just for treating them like this.

She\u2019s not the problem for having a panic attack, how she was treated was unacceptable.", "Because she's been abused?  Because being with your family triggers past traumas?  Because having your mom shout slurs at you is traumatic?  I'm betting this goes way back and she is carrying a load of trauma from her upbringing.
