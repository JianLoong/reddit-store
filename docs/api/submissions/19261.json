Lol actually more effective for ops purposes since it wears off a lot slower", "OP was high when they arrived, so the method is irrelevant and no child should be around enough marijuana smoke that breathing problems should be considered.", "I think she made an excellent choice.", "The women are at the forefront of those doing the pawning.", "Well it\u2019s not that extreme \nThe husband isn\u2019t very respectful of OP\u2019s wishes but u shouldn\u2019t immediately reconsider your marriage because of this", "I just imagine she's sitting in a room with a giant bong with a giant bowl filled just waiting until the adults come in to see her rip it.", "She mentioned that her husband said you could have talked fiftieth time. That simply means that she has already talked them about it.", "You sound like someone who would drop kids for free child care on someone else.", "Her house, not her children, she can get as high as she wants.", "Yet the boys can get drunk?", "What an absolutely insane take. Do you think she\u2019s going to accidentally microwave the kids or something?", "You need to get back in your time machine and go back to 1954.", "Found the mother in law!", "Totally missing the point, envy is bad \ud83d\ude0a", "I find it funny that MIL & SIL travel to OPs place, expect I assume free accommodation and meals prepared in addition to the babysitting, and THEY NEVER INVITE OP on their girl trip to the wineries. I know its because then no one will be their to play babysitter, maid, & chef, but if it was my house, I would be saying no more hosting or no more favourites, they can pick.\n\nNTA", "Canadians being nice to each other on the internet.  :D", "NTA, the family should absolutely know better. And hello to you my fellow British Columbian! It's great meeting another one of us in a random place!", "Hi from Vancouver Island!!! \u2764", "Me too!! Hot AF today eh?!", "Hi from the Lower Mainland! And NTA.", "\"oh, I tend to use it to relieve severe headaches and neck tension\"\n\n\n\"But you seem fine right now\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, guess being treated like an unpaid nanny just stresses me out!\"", "It's not my fault there's an interdimensional portal which keeps switching to a reality where it's legal to buy and the me in the other timeline just picked up, it's for our personal use officer", "Last I saw they're looking at legalizing growing at home and joining a club where people can grow on your behalf. Which isn't as good as actual stores but it's a big step up from having to buy it black market.\n\nEdit: I'm in a US state that has shops, it's still super weird but you can't beat the convenience and variety.", "Dutchie waving here! Selling weed is allowed with a permit. Having it on you for your own use is no problem. Don\u2019t smoke and drive though, that will get you in trouble", "To be fair the only reference I have for that is my friend who has bronchitis so severe that she can't even be outside if the neighbor is having a bbq", "Thwts pretty much what I had in mind.

Or ignore the kids.", "You can just leave every time they try to pawn their kids off on you.", "No. I just have backbone.", "They probably watched Reefer Madness back in the 1940's and it stuck.", "Oh dang, I'm from Vancouver Island, too. OP is not the asshole, and I think all of BC would have their back as that's utter bullshit.", "Agreed!! Apparently today(June 8) is supposed to get up to a high of 36 where I am and then Friday is supposed to drop to scattered showers with a 60% chance of rain and a high of 26, can our weather make up its damn mind?", "Y\u2019ALL ARE SO FUCKING CUTE I AM GOING TO ENJOY THIS DAY JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE ALL SO NICE TO EACH OTHER OMG I LOVE YOU ALL", "There was a time when the seller would just drop the stuff on the ground, then the buyer would accidentally drop money on the ground and they both accidentally picked up the \"wrong\" item.

I guess I just don't see the issue.", "Well I agree she shouldn't have to, but since saying no doesn't work for Op and she can't keep getting high, she can just go on a short walk every time they try to leave their children in her care.\n\nShe could ban children from her house or the adults until they respect her boundaries, but she needs her husband's cooperation and that's not happening either. Unless she becomes more assertive and deals with her husband and his relatives, leaving is the easiest solution.", "It's not just her house, so her banning them wouldn't be on her, especially when it's her husband's side. Why is it okay for the guys to get drunk, the other ladies go to wineries, but god forbid the woman living there can't get high? Why is that a problem?", "I never said it's ok to get drunk or to get high. Both is bad for your health and that's why it's not a great idea to get high or drunk every time she doesn't want to babysit. \n\nShe's avoiding confrontation instead of putting her foot down. From OP's post her husband is part of the problem, he enables his relatives and it's unlikely he's going to take action against them.", "I'm sorry I have to ask. Pray tell how is using marijuana bad for your health? I also noticed you said \"she can't keep getting high to not watch the kids\" why?"]}
