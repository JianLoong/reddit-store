Yesterday, I was looking through Facebook and happened to look at People You May Know, and there my daughters face is, on an account labeled with my grandmothers name. The account only has my daughters face on it, and in the people who are following account are only 5 people, 4 of them know my dad, one of them is my dad.\n\nMy dad is a creep, an asshole, and an overall POS. After what he did I never wanted him to see my daughters face. \n\nThis picture is one I do not have, taken by my grandmothers phone, in her house. I freaked out on her last night and she seems pretty convincing she didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m thinking of going no contact with her again if I find out she did. I only started talking to her because I missed her and wanted to celebrate Christmas with my family.\nAnd I missed my dog. \nNow I\u2019m wondering if that was the wrong choice.\n\nI feel like an asshole but I don\u2019t know who to trust, and I\u2019ve already reported the holy hell out of the profile and Facebook is refusing to remove it so my next step is contacting the police. I\u2019m beyond livid, when I saw it my whole body started shaking, and my immediate reaction was to block my grandmother and refuse all attempts at contact with her but for once in my life I decided to have a rational discussion about it and I\u2019m still not sure what to think. \ud83e\udee0 My head is a mess, it\u2019s 6am, and I\u2019m hungry, and mad.\n\nEdit for more information because a few people seem to think this is on my grandmothers Facebook: this is a whole new account, with only 5 friends on the account, all people being friends of my dad, and one of them being my dad, but an old account he apparently lost. They\u2019re following one person. The only pictures on this account are of my daughter, as a post, and as the accounts profile picture. The account says my grandmothers name, that\u2019s the only thing it shares with her, as well as the fact the picture was from her phone in her home.\n\nEdit #2 which I just remembered sounds important: she said when she clicks on the profile it says \u201clog in\u201d. Here\u2019s the quoted message from her after I sent her the link to the account; \u201cI just  hit it and it is telling me to  log in\u201d\n\nEdit: #3: so looking more into it, the account of my dads that\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d with this account is an old account he apparently lost and hasn\u2019t used since my brothers 17th birthday, so if he doesn\u2019t have access to it, why is he friends with this new account? The posts on it were made this year in January.\n\nEdit #4: Grandmother is very incessant if I call the police to get them to call her.", "created_utc": 1675767467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vz26v/aita_for_freaking_out_on_my_family_after_finding/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad is 42. Among many other things he has done like cornering me in his home with a knife pointed at himself saying I should just kill him if I didn\u2019t love him, when I was 14 and going through stuff mentally, physically, and emotionally and came downstairs stating I didn\u2019t love them. On top of that saying I SH\u2019d for attention, and saying I had \u201cthe ass of a black girl\u201d and sleeping with his girlfriend in the same room (bachelor apartment) as my little brother and sister.\n\nMy grandmother? Raging drunk. Says she can\u2019t get drunk off beer. Told me her doctor said it was okay to drink beer while pregnant. Told me it wasn\u2019t a good idea to breastfeed because you can\u2019t drink alcohol. And the cherry on top, when I told her not to tell anyone about my pregnancy because I wanted to do it at the 12 week mark, she told my mom and dad anyway and didn\u2019t tell me, I had to find out myself.\n\nSo many things are making me want to believe it was her. My heart doesn\u2019t want to believe it because she was the sole caregiver for me since 13. I thought she would be better then my mother and so I could be closer to my father. Now I understand why my mother didn\u2019t like them. It\u2019s always hate this hate that hate them. My mother is a different story. But yeah.", "That\u2019s very lucky for you.

Even if it's a fake account and she was hacked, she still had to have the picture on her facbook to begin with. They dont hack your actual phone or computer they hack your fb. Which means the picture had to be on her facbook to be stolen. Even if its not her account she still uploaded the original photo to her actual account or they wouldnt have been able to access it. So she's still ultimately at fault for the picture being on social media.", "Then the aunt or uncle are the leak.", "There's your answer. Aunt and uncle. They put grandma's name to throw you off.", "Nope - it can come up from being in the same area too.

It was creepy.", "Um, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this but it sounds like you should really cut your whole family off and go out and build your life without them.

While she doesn\u2019t say she supports my dads behaviours, she\u2019s Facebook buddies with the person I ended up decided to go no contact with him for. Anyway, would they be able to take pictures from messenger?", "I want to so bad. I feel like I\u2019m stuck with invisible chains tied to them. They raised me to believe family mattered more then anything no matter what they do. My husbands family isn\u2019t any better. So it would just be me and him, in this shitty economy. I have no world experience and I\u2019m trying to learn everything I can because my family just let me stay out of school and not work as long as I was close to them. I\u2019ve only had 2 jobs, I don\u2019t have a high school diploma, I\u2019m trying to get my GED. As soon as we\u2019re on our feet we\u2019re moving either to another province(state, we live in Canada) or another country. Anywhere away from our families. But we\u2019re both young. My husband will be 19 this year, and I\u2019ll be 21. I don\u2019t even feel 21, I feel like I\u2019m still just a little kid, playing make believe, but now I have a kid and I have to do right by them. And this world is terrifying. But I\u2019m definitely trying to find out who deserves to be in my adult life.", "What I personally assume happened after the few exchanges I had with op is that grandma was hacked and that's the source of the new account. The picture was probably accessed through messenger since that's where grandma had sent it to aunt and uncle. Grandma's recount of the tale sounds like a scam link she clicked and gave them her password. That gives them access to her messenger where she was exchanging pics with aunt and uncle. Now theres a fake account using her daughter's picture. Op still had every right to freak out though and ultimately it's still grandma's fault this is happening if this is in fact what happened.", "You can save pics from messenger yes. Me and my sil use it all the time to exchange photos of family events. There's also the option to block certain people from seeing your posts even if they are your friends. I have whole albums my ex-mil can't see on my fb even though we are friends and everyone else can see them. So if her account was hacked they have access to everything she ever tied to her fb including messenger", "This is what a toxic family looks like. They set you up to fail so they can control you. You are already 21, I was 17 when I moved out and had to do an extra year in high school to get my diploma. \n\nStart with a job that doesn\u2019t require a diploma but will let you work full time, usually fast food or grocery stores don\u2019t require it but also try athletic clubs or any other place you typically see teens working. If they hire teens they don\u2019t require a diploma. Then before you\u2019re hired let them know you\u2019d like full time hours. Get the cheapest apartment you can afford and only buy basic necessities. If you smoke, drink, do drugs quit, that gets expensive quick and will eat up all your funds. \n\nSave every bit you can, save change, look for side jobs you can do on your days off, sell any old possessions you don\u2019t need. As soon as you get your diploma/GED upgrade your job to something entry level that requires it. Customer service and tech support jobs tend to train so all you need is that GED. \n\nRemember no one has any world experience when they start out on their own. It\u2019s absolutely ok to ask friends, mentors, etc for advise just not your toxic family. And go easy on yourself. The world can seem scary at first but when you cut out the toxic people and start making true friends who become your family you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s not that bad at all.", "Definitely doing the best I can!! I don\u2019t trust anyone to look after my daughter, babysitter or daycare, as I\u2019ve had bad experiences with both - so I\u2019m going to look after her at home, and hopefully by the time she\u2019s 1 or 2 I\u2019ll be confident enough to babysit kids, walk dogs, or maybe even work at a daycare myself, somewhere I can bring her with me. \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019m literally a helicopter parent already and she\u2019s not even a year old. Luckily I stopped smoking, drinking, and smoking weed after my daughter was born, so that\u2019s a money saver! Currently I\u2019m selling just about everything I own, clothes, sentimental items\u2026 there\u2019s a picture I don\u2019t know about that my mothers owned since she was a kid which she gave to me which I\u2019ve known all my life, I don\u2019t know whether to sell it or keep it or give it to my siblings. She reported me to DCS and lied about doing it so I cut her off. So the logical thing would be to get rid of it. It\u2019s this Anne Geddes picture with two twin babies dressed as mice in a boot."]}
