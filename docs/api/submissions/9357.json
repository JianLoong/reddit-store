Yesterday, I was looking through Facebook and happened to look at People You May Know, and there my daughters face is, on an account labeled with my grandmothers name. The account only has my daughters face on it, and in the people who are following account are only 5 people, 4 of them know my dad, one of them is my dad.\n\nMy dad is a creep, an asshole, and an overall POS. After what he did I never wanted him to see my daughters face. \n\nThis picture is one I do not have, taken by my grandmothers phone, in her house. I freaked out on her last night and she seems pretty convincing she didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m thinking of going no contact with her again if I find out she did. I only started talking to her because I missed her and wanted to celebrate Christmas with my family.\nAnd I missed my dog. \nNow I\u2019m wondering if that was the wrong choice.\n\nI feel like an asshole but I don\u2019t know who to trust, and I\u2019ve already reported the holy hell out of the profile and Facebook is refusing to remove it so my next step is contacting the police. I\u2019m beyond livid, when I saw it my whole body started shaking, and my immediate reaction was to block my grandmother and refuse all attempts at contact with her but for once in my life I decided to have a rational discussion about it and I\u2019m still not sure what to think. \ud83e\udee0 My head is a mess, it\u2019s 6am, and I\u2019m hungry, and mad.\n\nEdit for more information because a few people seem to think this is on my grandmothers Facebook: this is a whole new account, with only 5 friends on the account, all people being friends of my dad, and one of them being my dad, but an old account he apparently lost. They\u2019re following one person. The only pictures on this account are of my daughter, as a post, and as the accounts profile picture. The account says my grandmothers name, that\u2019s the only thing it shares with her, as well as the fact the picture was from her phone in her home.\n\nEdit #2 which I just remembered sounds important: she said when she clicks on the profile it says \u201clog in\u201d. Here\u2019s the quoted message from her after I sent her the link to the account; \u201cI just  hit it and it is telling me to  log in\u201d\n\nEdit: #3: so looking more into it, the account of my dads that\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d with this account is an old account he apparently lost and hasn\u2019t used since my brothers 17th birthday, so if he doesn\u2019t have access to it, why is he friends with this new account? The posts on it were made this year in January.\n\nEdit #4: Grandmother is very incessant if I call the police to get them to call her.\n\nEdit #5: I just asked her to send me the messages between her and my aunt and uncle where she sent the photos and she\u2019s refusing to because she, quoted from her text, \u201cI am not  sending  anything  so someone else can  see or get it on line\u201d so I\u2019ve told her me and my Husband are coming over today to look at her phone and personally see the messages sent ourselves.\n\nEDIT #6: so I feel the need to share that we also told everyone we didn\u2019t want anyone kissing her, hands or face or anywhere. And so I went to the bathroom, entrusting her with my daughter, under my husbands watchful eyes. And my husband told me that she kissed her face AND mouth (the mouth was on part my daughters fault, babies move a lot, but not the point) and she didn\u2019t tell me about this. Not only that, she lit a CIGARETTE right beside us while we had her in her car seat outside waiting for my MIL to pick us up.

My dad is 42. Among many other things he has done like cornering me in his home with a knife pointed at himself saying I should just kill him if I didn\u2019t love him, when I was 14 and going through stuff mentally, physically, and emotionally and came downstairs stating I didn\u2019t love them.

The picture was probably accessed through messenger since that's where grandma had sent it to aunt and uncle.

If they hire teens they don\u2019t require a diploma. Then before you\u2019re hired let them know you\u2019d like full time hours. Get the cheapest apartment you can afford and only buy basic necessities. If you smoke, drink, do drugs quit, that gets expensive quick and will eat up all your funds. \n\nSave every bit you can, save change, look for side jobs you can do on your days off, sell any old possessions you don\u2019t need.

Are they forgetting that IS your job because she can't protect herself. \n\nPerhaps they and anyone else who may have been involved needs a reminder. \n\nGentle or harsh your CHOICE. \n\nBecause this is about the PRINCIPLE of the issue. \n\n> I made it explicitly clear to the family that I did not want her face anywhere online until she was old enough to consent, so I could respect her privacy.\n\nDisrespectful. Inconsiderate. Rude.\n\nTo go behind your back and completely ignore your request. \n\nA valid safety precaution for YOUR CHILD. Not theirs. Yours.\n\n>This picture is one I do not have, taken by my grandmothers phone, in her house. \n\nDoes she know why you went NC? If so WHY is she being dismissive of your feelings and wants. How many other pictures are on her phone that you don't know about.\n\n>I\u2019m thinking of going no contact with her again if I find out she did.\n\nWhich means there have been others times she has done something you did not like.\n\nPerhaps she needs a reminder that the world doesn't revolve around her.

You know it was her. She\u2019s clearly got a questionable moral compass and has no problem going against things you specifically ask her not to do so like it seems like she\u2019s just lying to you and it\u2019s her.

Go into your settings and help section and you can stipulate that aas the child's parent you do not give your authorisation for your minor childs pictures to be used and you want it removed.  You upload the name of the account and other identifying information about the offending account and the stolen picture so they can ensure they delete the correct one. \n\nThen go NC  with your grandmother and anyone else who stomps on your reasonable boundaries.
