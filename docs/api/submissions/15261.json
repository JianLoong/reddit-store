For context, this happened on New Years but it still gets brought up so I need to know if I was wrong. Now, my ex and I split in November.

Would sleep while supposed to be watching them, yell if they cried and tell them to \"grow up\" and take off to his buddies house to play basketball every single day for hours. He didn't work. So I worked FT. I ended up leaving him and kicking him out because I became repulsed by him, his laziness and his parenting abilities. He is also your typical momma's boy and mommy dearest thinks her precious baby boy can do no wrong. Bails him out of everything, gloats about his \"accomplishments\" on FB. Even tried convincing him to move back home with our daughter so she could help raise her because she didn't feel I was capable of taking care of two children like she is. Just real ignorant. \n\nAnyways, on New Years I wanted to go out. I haven't been out since becoming a mom. At this point my ex was still trying to butter me up and prove he could be different, so he offered to watch the kids. He brought them to his mom's house because he \"didn't want to spend the new year alone\". His mom posts on FB and says \"I raised such a good man! Watching the kids so their mother could go to party while he stays in with his babies and watches the ball drop. He's such a good dad.\" And everyone was on there literally buttering up the situation and a few were like \"Omg what a good daddy. You must be so proud that he would rather spend time inside with the kiddos rather than go party it up with buddies.\" So I commented on it and said \"You're right, it's so awesome that he is watching the children he helped create so the mother of his children who works full time and is a mom full time can go and get a break for the first time in almost 4 years. Being a full time single parent since they were born has been tough and I'm thankful I actually got time to myself for once while their other parent stepped up.\" It was passive aggressive. I didn't even have to post it but it riled me up. A LOT of people \"wow\" reacted to my comment and a few people reached out to both him and his mother and asked how often he has the kids. Apparently I \"took her post the wrong way and caused unnecessary drama because I assumed everything is an attack\". Again, it's brought up every time he sees the kids (once a month) because I guess people still ask him why he doesn't take the kids more often.

People that choose to be compassionate for a deadbeat dad are not people you need in your corner. But posting petty shit online like this is not smart. It sounds like everything is informal now, but if you eventually go to court for a formal custody agreement, stuff like that post could be used by your ex's attorney to claim you're alienating the kids from him. \n\nAlways think of your kids first. Keep all conversation with him neutral and just about what's needed regarding the kids.", "lmao like the dad is acting like an adult hiding behind mommy on facebook lmaooooo", "Maybe he should grow up and act like a parent!

Not start an argument online for the world to see.", "But she wasnt attacking him. She was defending herself after her exMIL decided it was okay to villanize her and paint her as an irresponsible parent who would rather go out and party than take care of her children and paint his son as such a good dad that does everything for his children. When it was clearly the other way around.\n\nexMIL started shitting on her publicly and OP publicly shut that discussion up, and will i say in a rather classy way because i would have chosen some other more colorful words...", "Which option is better to keep a civil relationship?  \n\n1. Reply via comment where everyone can see\n\n2. Text or Call  her ex and express what his mother did was ok.\n\n\nNow I wouldn't have a problem if he was the one who made the post because he's hindering the relationship between them two. But in this case we don't even know if he knew what his mom did. Op should have spoke to him,  not to the world"]}
