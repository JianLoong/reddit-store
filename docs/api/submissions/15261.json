Why does she have to be the bigger person when they are insulting her and undermining all her hard work? No wonder her son turned out so useless. She was a shit parent and probably a shitty grandparent too. OP is not TA for defending herself, she is only human. She was being disrespected publicly. How is that helpful for the children?", "Real world, eh? You do realize this shit like this is precisely *why* humans evolved to have shame as an emotion? It's a tactic to make sure that those in your social/family unit wouldn't neglect their reponsibilities, like *raising the damn young.*\n\nSo, at the most fundamental level, OP is damn well living in the real world--and her ex is experiencing completely normal social pressures for acting poorly.", "We all live in the real world.   Looks like you're the one that doesn't understand how the world works.", "No one is preventing him from stepping up and being the father he pretends to be. \n\nOP was just agreeing with her ex-MIL and providing context.", "Yes this!\n\nAh I wish I could change my original comment to suggest that! \n\nI love a good positive suggestion on AITA gives me hope. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: I was able to change it", "You can also change your mindset from \"annoyed\" to laughing at their idiocy.  ;-)", "Yea well pretty much everyone who saw that thinks she YTA. It was his moms page. Yea op YTA. Y\u2019all are wild/dumb asf for saying she not.", ">Yea well pretty much everyone who saw that thinks she YTA\n\nThen it's awfully strange that all those folks keep asking why he's not stepping up, even weeks after the fact, isn't it? It's almost like...perhaps they might not. Hmm.", "Mom encourages husband\u2019s deadbeat behaviors and shat all over op publicly, why shouldn\u2019t op clear the issue publicly.\n\nIf someone tells a lie in public, and then tell the truth in private, people only hear the lie and the truth goes unheard.", "Yea right that\u2019s his and his moms fam and friends.", "I don't really understand this response. Can you explain how/why his mom's \"fam and friends\" simultaneously don't believe it, and yet continue to ask about it with enough frequency that it's still an active issue and bothering OP's ex over a month later?\n\nThese two things are in conflict with each other. Your response amounts to \"Yes, I acknowledge the color is red, but the color is blue.\" It is quite literally nonsensical."]}
