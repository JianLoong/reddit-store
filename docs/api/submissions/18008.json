Find a way to reserve a private space so you don\u2019t disrupt others. Using the \u201cquiet study\u201d room for an interview is rude. That\u2019s not what the space is intended for.", "YTA\n\nIt is not for that use. I sympathize, but find another place to do video calls.", "YTA \n\nThe quiet study room is not where you have an interview", "YTA- it is a QUIET study room, not a 'take an interview room'.  You need to talk to the library staff and ask if they have private study rooms you could book for doing these interviews.", "YTA - Sorry you're having a hard time financially, but your situation doesn't negate the rules of the shared space you're in.", "YTA\n\nGo sit in your bedroom with the door closed.  Go sit in your car.  Go sit ANYWHERE but a library where you're speaking at normal volume in a quiet study room.", "Soft YTA. Many libraries have meeting room spaces with doors that you could reserve for this use. While the one you were going to may not have one, if you asked your library they could probably direct you to one nearby that does. There's even a possibility they have a different room (in your current library) that they would let you use, if they were aware of your need for a space like that. Using a quiet study space and talking at normal volume is a bit rude to the other patrons, as they may actually use the space as it was intended.", "I feel your pain, but you should have arranged it properly with the library first to avoid this type of conflict. While I sympathise, you don't get to commandeer a public space, however much you need it.\n\nSo yeah, sorry but YTA.", "It is not the \"quiet so somebody can have a conversation room\" it's the \"quiet  - so nobody have a conversation room\"", ">I didn't get that job because of the confrontation that the woman initiated.\n\nNo. You didn't get the job because of (a) the confrontation *you* caused by your poor planning and sense of entitlement and abuse of a public space, and (b) because of how badly you handled the confrontation. This is on you, not on some innocent woman bystander. Own your mistakes, do better. \n\nYTA.\n\nBut good luck with the job hunt nevertheless.", "YTA - it\u2019s a quiet study room, not an interview room.", "Soft YTA. I am sorry this happened to you, but OP, you have to remember that you're in a public facility. It is called the 'quiet' room for a reason. My recommendation is to find another space that you will not be disturbed in the future, but also make sure you check and reserve the room in advance to prevent any further interruptions.", "YTA\n\neven though no one complained about it in your previous interviews, the rules of a \"quiet study room\" applies 24/7. Sorry that his happened to you but you couldnt possibly think that no one would eventually call you out on this?", "Yep, YTA. I\u2019d be really frustrated if I was trying to study in the \u201cQuiet Study Room\u201d and some asshole was yapping away on a Zoom call. Good for the woman to call you on it, don\u2019t do it again and find another space to have that interview.", "YTA. The point of a \"quiet study\" room is that you keep your yap closed. NO TALKING! People go to a \"quiet study\" room in a library to avoid assholes that make noise in the rest of the library. \n\nDon't go to a \"quiet study\" space for an activity that requires you to make noise.", "YTA. It would be one thing if you didn't have any other options, but you're not at the library because you're homeless, you're at the library because you don't want to fess up to your family that you lost your job. I get it, that sucks, but that is not a concern that justifies disrupting other people's use of shared resources.", "I am sorry about your situation but that doesn't mean the rules don't apply to you. It is a quiet room, and you were not being quiet. Speaking in a normal volume is not quiet no matter if what you are doing is important to you. Literally read the room. YTA.", "Yta.  A quiet study room is not the place for interviews.  Most libraries have individual ribs you might be able to use.", "YTA. Libraries are the most quite places for a reason. If I was studying for one of my law school exams in a quite study room and you would speak in a normal volume for more than 2 minutes I would freak out. Show some respect to others, the Sun is not revolving around you.", "Soft YTA - most libraries or at least most I have been in have rooms you can go into.  Had you been in one of those rooms by yourself no problem, but doing it where other people can hear you makes it so that you are the AH I'm this situation", "YTA. It is the QUIET study room. I bet the library has another room you could potentially use. You were just too proud or lazy to ask.", "YTA - next time ask the librarian for a private study room if one is available.", "YTA - what part of QUIET did you not understand?\n\n  Also, how about being HONEST with your kids.  Parents should talk to kids about finances - it helps them grow into more financially responsible adults. People lose their job every day, kids should know about that.   Even if it was your fault that you lost your job, you can explain that happens and that you understand what you need to do differently next time (better job fit, different type of job, different management structure...).  If it wasn't your fault, all the more reason to explain to your kids - this happens, this is why it is important to have emergency funds (and you don't have one and it is stressful, so as soon as you get a job, you are going to start building one and we are going to have to be very careful with out spending so we can make this happen), this is why it is important for you to be quiet when I ask so I can interview....", "YTA \n\nBut very soft. You're in a very rough spot. I think moving forward, it would be a good idea to see about reserving the room or asking the librarians if there's a different space you can use. I think asking permission here and explaining would go a long way. I hope things improve.", "YTA", "Yta it's a *quiet room*. It's not an unreasonable expectation for someone to come in and have it quiet.\n\nIf no one else is there, fine. But once someone comes in and wants the quiet room to be *quiet*, either leave or be quiet.", "YTA. libraries have private rooms for shit like that now. I use one for my proctor finals for school. Book one.", "YTA, all you had to do was reserve a private room in the library as soon as you got the interview\n\n\nLack of planning on your part", "YTA. Do your interviews at home. Why are you invading a public quiet space? You don't have to panic your kids.", "YTA. It's called the \"quiet study room\" not the \"loud video chat room\".  You didn't get the job because you chose to be rude and take a call in a room that was supposed to be quiet.  That's horrible and selfish planning on your part, so losing the job was your fault.", "YTA maybe your lack of reading comprehension in that you should in fact be quiet in the \u201cQuiet study\u201d room is part of why you are having a hard time finding employment.", "Really, you need to ask this. LIBRARY = QUIET! YTA!", "INFO: Was this a quiet room as in a group conference room type of room? Or one of the study cubicles? My local colleges library has both and both are referred to as \u201cquiet rooms\u201d, despite one being meant for group projects which will obviously involve people talking, the other is meant for a single person to study and is exposed to the rest of the library.", "YTA. It\u2019s a library everyone knows to keep quiet in a library.", "YTA\n\nIt's not the purpose of the room and she wasn't out of bounds to confront you or complain about it.\n\nKind of sucks that the recruiter wasn't a little more understanding of your circumstances, especially if that was the only reason you didn't get the job.", "Going to disagree here. It depends entirely on how the study room is set up. Is it actually a whole separate room with a door that closes? If that\u2019s the case you are NTA. As a librarian myself, anyone is free to use that room for whatever they need as long as it isn\u2019t left in a mess or that you\u2019re yelling constantly. \n\nHowever if the room is not separate and was an actual public space, then yes YTA. People being on speakerphone in the main portion of the library annoys the hell out of me and it\u2019s disrespectful. You can always ask the librarians if there are ways to accommodate what you need, no harm in simply asking.", "NTA\n\nAsk the librarian if there is a better spot they would recommend. Explain you are not trying to be disruptive but you are unemployed and trying to get back on your feet. My library is always very understanding of people applying for jobs or doing interviews.", "Info: are there other people in the study room or is it the kind where it's small and you are in there by yourself?", "ESH - I'm guessing you went to the quiet room because you expected quiet (which is totally reasonable for a job interview) but you also disturbed other people seeking the same thing. Sounds like that person's response was really not in proportion to the situation though! I don't know what your library is like but I know the ones where I live have private rooms you can rent out at no cost. Maybe look into booking one next time you land an interview.", "I mean.... How loud were you being? Do you know for sure they they couldn't hear you outside of that room? Either way if you thought there may be the slightest chance of you being in trouble for doing job interviews in that room, you may have wanted to go somewhere else. I can't call you an AH for that though, honestly I probably would have done the same thing lol", "INFO was this a shared study room? Or a small first come, first serve room where you were the only occupant?", "Librarian here.\n\nEvery library I've worked at has at least one study room. A private, quiet space an individual can request to use. When I worked in public, patrons used that room all the time for Zoom meetings and interviews. In fact, if someone was using one of the public computers for this, we would lend them a laptop and direct them to that room. \n\nUnofficially, libraries have moved past the \"complete silent\" rule. Being that loud in the public is rude, but not in the study room.\n\nNTA, by the way.", "This is a very tough situation. That lady is a total a-hole for not just telling the librarian and letting them address it; as if there's nowhere else to go in the freaking library. That being said, you should have spoken with the librarian directly and asked if there was any space you could borrow for a job interview; I'm sure there was something they could have done / recommended. Best of luck to you, but ESH.", "NTA, public space. I\u2019m used to crazies in my public library. A job interview is nothing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course you're n.t.a.\" haha.  \nI mean, I like to see other people's perspectives on things... But you weren't born yesterday, and you know damn well what libraries are used for. Quiet in the library is still a trope in films & tv for a reason. It's a *quiet* place for people to study and concentrate. Unless the place you were in was a literal closed off conference room type area, then you gotta know YTA. You can't repurpose public spaces to fit your own needs", "Go to a wework space and rent a private room. YTA", "YTA it's that you specifically chose the QUIET room to...not be quiet. What kind of thought process made you decide that was how that worked? No wonder that recruiter didn't hire you, you can't even take simple, common sense direction well.", "YTA, unfortunately.\n\nI worked at a library, and there was one place where we did enforce quiet. That was the quiet study room. All other places, there was no shushing unless it got above a reasonable volume. But you could count on the quiet study room to be what it said on the sign. I'd have been upset if I went there to get away from voices and someone was using their phone for a conversation or doing a zoom interview.\n\nIn the future, ask if they have a PRIVATE study room. We had those too, and people would often use them for small meetings (4 or fewer participants) or virtual work. They were much smaller and had doors that closed (with windows so you could see if the room was occupied).", "I believe most libraries have individual rooms that can be booked for private use for free. Maybe look into that. Library staff absolutely know that their facility can be a lifeline for people who are unemployed or unhoused. They will try to help you.", "YTA.

It was disruptive to everyone else in there, whether they said anything to you or not.  Sit in your car, or ask the librarians if there is a place you could use, or find another place altogether.\n\nI do believe the feedback about the confrontation, but likely the interviewer was put off by you using a public quiet space for an interview and not being considerate of others.", "YTA 100%", "Yta.  Use the quiet room", "YTA. I feel bad for you, but the way to do this would be either by asking a librarian to reserve a small private study room or going to a location that is not meant for quiet study. The librarians being sympathetic does not give you the right to be loud in a quiet study room.", "YTA. There are public spaces in most libraries or community centers you can sign out for instances like this, but you chose the quiet study room where your noise was bothering people there to study quietly.", "Yeah. For all OP  knows, that woman was studying for a career-defining exam.", "Normally, the library had no problem with it. The only thing I was commandeering was the available table (of which there were 3 in that space) and my own laptop.\n\nI accept your judgement.", "Yes.  The quiet study room is for students to get work done / study for exams.  Not for someone to be hosting zoom calls, no matter what predicament you are in.
