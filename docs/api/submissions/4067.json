Fake names.\n\nI (48 F) have been dating my boyfriend Joe (52 M) for five years. Joe has a daughter, Lily (21 F). Only because it is relevant to the story, Lily and me did not have the best start. She was already in her late teens when I entered the picture and had difficulty adjusting to my presence. I really wanted to be a mother figure to her, but she constantly rejected me extremely harshly, which hurt a lot and led to many arguments between all three of us.\n\nWhen she was 18, she left for college and rarely comes back to visit us. She always says she wants to be with her friends during the holidays but sends us gifts and talks to us throughout it. This year Joe put his foot down and said that he wanted her home for Christmas because her friends always have her. She apologized but said she was going to her friends again because she really missed her friend's mom, and she bought a puzzle for the two of them to do together. I could tell this hurt Joe, so I tried to talk to Lily myself, and it went so badly. When I called her, I told her she was hurting her dad's feelings, and that wasn't ok, and she needed to learn to split time up between her friends and family evenly. She told me that it wasn't surprising I didn't know how to mind my business for the millionth time and that she had already made plans and wasn't going to back out of them last minute, especially because she promised her friends mom they would do the puzzle together. I admit I was wrong and lost my temper and started yelling at her because I could tell she wasn't paying attention to what I was saying, and she hung up on me. Now, this has turned into a whole situation, with more than half of her dad's side of the family telling me to butt out because I made things worse. I was really just trying to do right by my husband because I could tell he really wanted her to come home for Christmas.", "created_utc": 1670289595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdqrn5/aita_for_arguing_with_my_boyfriends_daughter_over/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or you. \n\nLet the adults have their relationship.", "YTA.. clearly the daughter has her reasonings for not coming around, and since she mentioned you don\u2019t know how to mind your own business, I bet it has something to do with her not liking you. \n\n\nBut you are lily\u2019s dad\u2019s girlfriend and nothing more to her, so the last thing she wants is you calling and telling her what to do. \n\nIf your boyfriend misses his kid, why doesn\u2019t he set some time to go visit her?", "children dont go no contact/low contact with their parent(s) for no reason. there is something missing from here", "YTA. \n\nSHE. DOESN\u2019T. WANT. A. RELATIONSHIP. WITH. YOU. \n\nUnderstand it, accept it and leave her alone.", "YTA - read between the lines. You pushed yourself on her too hard from the start and pushed her away. She doesn\u2019t want to spend time with you, you aren\u2019t her family. And unfortunately her father is a casualty of this situation. You calling her to yell at her over this isn\u2019t going to make her want to come home. You\u2019ve mismanaged this relationship from the start and the best thing you can do is back off before you cause more damage.", "News flash, she's staying away because of you.  You seemed to have wanted to force your idea of what your relationship with her should have been when she was younger, disregarding her opinion.  YTA.", "YTA You're not a \"mother figure\", your just this young woman's father's girlfriend. You have zero influence. This young woman is an adult and she is free to spend her holidays where she wants and with whom she pleases.  It's time for you to accept you're just her father's girlfriend and leave her alone, you mean nothing to her and it's time to accept it.", "YTA. This is between your husband and his kid. You should apologize to both of them for butting in. This is not your business. I repeat, this is not your business.\n\nShe is an adult and has every right to live her own life and decide how involved you are in it. I recommend you work on making your place more welcoming to step daughter because it's sounds really hostile for her if you and her dad make demands about what she does. That guilt trip you tried to pull isn't the way to do that, nor is yelling demanding she pay attention.", "YTA and to be honest it started from when you first met her. You tried to be her mother but she didn\u2019t want you. My guess is you pushed too hard and now she wants nothing to do with you. Your are not her mother. Tell yourself that a million times. Then consider apologizing her for not listening to her (from the beginning when she didn\u2019t want you to be her mother) and promising to do better AND then butt out of her life. If you can do that then maybe one day things will get better.", "YTA, she's not your daughter and you don't get to act like her mom.", "YTA. Tbh, you're probably most of the reason she hasn't been coming home, so calling her to berate her only reaffirmed her decision to stay away. Next year offer to leave if she comes home. Dollars to doughnuts she'd book a flight home immediately.", "YTA - if you ever want his daughter to come home for Christmas, you absolutely need to butt out, and even more importantly, stop criticizing her. You aren't her mother and she has zero interest in you filling that role, but you think you can call her up and chide her like a biological parent? No wonder she doesn't want to spend Christmas with you.", "YTA. This isn't your place. You aren't her mother or her stepmother. She's made it clear she doesn't want a relationship with you. You need to butt out.", "YTA.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, so is Joe, because either you\u2019re not the only reason Lily doesn\u2019t come home for the holidays, or you are and he\u2019s still with you anyway.  But regardless, I don\u2019t know why he thought he could *demand* her presence.

But your concern was only to your husband and not her. That\u2019s understandable but you then choose to interfere to protect him, and in doing do you\u2019ve probably caused more harm", "YTA.  And so is Joe for this \"This year Joe put his foot down and said that he wanted her home for Christmas\".  I'm going to guess this was more in the realm of a demand since most people don't tend to say \"I put my foot down and then very calmly and quietly respectfully stated my request and asked ever so politely if they would consider it.\"\n\nShe is a 21 year old adult.  She can vote, she can smoke, she can defend your country, she can marry, she can pop out kids, and she sure as hell can decide where and with whom she spends the holidays.  You don't have to like that she doesn't want to spend them with you, but you do have to respect that she has that right and you can't control it.  I'm sure she has reasons and maybe one day if the two of you ever stop overstepping and bulldozing her boundaries she might actually decide to let you know what they are.", "You have probably done more harm to there relationship by trying to help, step away and let them deal with it on their own", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not her mother and you don\u2019t have a parental relationship with her. She\u2019s an adult and can decide where she spends her time. Her dad doesn\u2019t have to be happy about it, but he can make the choice to address it directly with her if he\u2019s upset. You had no place in this conversation.", "YTA. For starter, she was in her late teens when you came into her life, you were never going to be a mother figure to her if you were trying to be. \n\nShe's an adult and it's her life to decide how she splits her time. You two clearly don't respect her and it's no wonder she doesn't want to go home. Leave the poor woman alone.", "YTA. She was in her late teens when you came into the picture and you wanted to be a \u201cmother figure\u201d?  Now she\u2019s an adult and setting boundaries that are none of your business and you wonder why she doesn\u2019t want to spend the holidays with you and her dad. \n\nShe\u2019s not your child. Mind your business.", "YTA.\nThis is between Joe and Lily. She is his daughter, not yours. It is their relationship to figure out.\n\nYou do not have, by your own admission, a good relationship with her. You are in no position to negotiate with her. I understand you wanted to defend your boyfriend's broken heart, but she was and is never going to hear anything if value from you. I don't know what you thought you were going to accomplish...because you know she doesn't care what you think. You are not her mother, and she owes you nothing.\n\nInstead of listening to her, trying to understand her, attempting to find out what she is thinking, you start yelling and screaming at her. You have now virtually guaranteed that she will not ever visit her father while you are around - not for any foreseeable future. Why would she, after that? Who wants to spend time in the company of a pushy, screaming lunatic?\n\n(Edited to correct they are not married)", "YTA   We don\u2019t choose family.  We choose friends and if she wants to spend holidays with people she likes that\u2019s her choice.  Somewhere along the line her dad didn\u2019t become/remain important to her. Somewhere he failed her. Maybe he cheated on mom. Maybe not. Maybe mom died (you never said) and he became more interested in you than in her. But for whatever reason you and him are not important enough to her. \n\nThat\u2019s her choice and yelling won\u2019t fix that.", "If you had a close relationship, you might have been able to have a heart to heart with her about her relationship with her father and ask her for a visit. Instead, you called to dictate how she spends her time and were disrespectful about it. There is a reason people go low contact with their family and I'm guessing you're it. YTA", "YTA, she\u2019s not obligated to share time with dad and you. If she doesn\u2019t feel good she doesn\u2019t have to do it. Something else has happened if she wants to stay away and sometimes our friends become our closed family so don\u2019t interfere because you\u2019re none to her. This should only be between your husband and Lily, not you.", "So, you got with Joe while Lily was 16 and in 2 years she left for college and decided to never visit you? Very sus. Maybe you should look into the origin of the problem instead of focusing on the simple fact she wants to spend the holidays with her friends. Also, is where is her biological mother?

She has also already made it clear that she doesn't want you to be a part of her life and you should respect that instead of yelling at her over the phone and making things worse.", "YTA and you're the reason for this problem. Get a clue and some selfawareness. She never needed you as a mother figure. Your husband will always wonder why his daughter won't let him walk her down the aisle and it's all on you.", "There are always a ton of posts on this sub about step parents trying to overstep their role, and the step child resenting them.\n\nHonestly it sounds like Lily was almost an adult when you started dating her dad, and as you said, you tried to be a mother figure to her. She clearly didn\u2019t want or need one at this point, so the relationship soured.\n\nShe now has set boundaries with the two of you, and as an adult, isn\u2019t obligated to spend any time (or holidays) with you two. It was inappropriate of you to tell her she needed to spend time with her dad over the holidays. Sounds like this is another example of you overstepping your role.

Ironically enough you killed any chance you had to have some sort of relationship with her.", "You meant well but YTA. For heaven\u2019s sake you\u2019re all adults. This is between the other two not you.", "YTA. For Lily to spend several Christmases in a row away from her father suggests that she is deeply uncomfortable in his home - most likely because you keep insisting on violating her boundaries, and she is trying to avoid that conflict without hurting her father. \n\nOnce and for all, OP: she is not your daughter, and you cannot force that relationship on her.

That only began to change when she stopped demanding authority over me (you have literally none) or trying to parent me.

YOU pushing the want to be her mother and Joe probably backing you up on it, is the whole and sole reason she rarely visits and doesn't spend Christmas with you both.\n\nShe doesn't have to pay attention to you on where and who she visits during her breaks.

You're not the person she can hear this message from. \n\nYou came into Lily's life -- not even as a wife but as a girlfriend -- when she was sixteen years old! It's really, really not realistic to expect to be a mother figure to a child that age. And CERTAINLY not expect it to happen right away. At most you can hope for being seen as a \"cool aunt\" type figure. \n\nOf course the mom/bonus mom thing happens sometimes, even with older teens, but when it does it's usually because the relationship was allowed to develop ***naturally, over time, without pressuring the child to feel a certain way before they're ready****.* I'm willing to bet that's not what you did. And I'm sure it's painful to know, but you have to face the fact that ship has sailed. Any chance you might have had of being a mother figure to Lily is likely gone. \n\nThe best way to help Joe now, to preserve his relationship with his daughter, is to BACK WAY OFF.

Also, maybe, he didn\u2019t discuss with Lily before starting the relationship which made her resent you even more. It\u2019s just a case of unresolved trauma that is boiling at this point.

I tried to talk to her about it once during the first year of us dating, and she said she didn't want to talk about it.", "You didn't perhaps consider that - by your own account - she already sees you as an overbearing interloper, and your calling to tell her what to do about her relationship wlth her father would only reinforce that?", "You're right, it's not about you.

I think you\u2019ve blown any chance of a relationship with her.", "So maybe Lily is just having a hard time accepting that Joe actually moved on from his previous relationship, and maybe that ruined her family image in her eyes. I'm going to say NTA but it is still not your place to raise your voice at a girl that is not your child. I would suggest you apologize to her solely about losing your temper with her, I feel like you meant no real harm, and I can understand where you are coming from. My dad has had his fair share of affairs (I am not saying you and Joe were having an affair) but from a daughter's perspective I understand her not wanting to be associated with you. From now on just let Joe and Lily decide for themselves how they wish to spend their time together, to avoid future conflicts."]}
