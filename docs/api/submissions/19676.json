I think you did well to deal with a potentially dangerous situation.", "NTA you\u2019re a good sister for taking care of your brother. Better for him to be mad at you than for something that could have happened had you not been there. Like possibly falling and hitting his or choking on his own vomit. He will eventually stop being mad. But death is forever. I would suggest talking to him because he may not realize the danger he could have been in had you not been there.", " My twin sis and I were raised the same way,we thought nothing of walking from the shower to our room or peeling our bathing suits off at the basement door and \u2018streaking\u2019 upstairs to shower and change,lol.

It doesn\u2019t seem like hes mad you helped him or slept next to him more that he\u2019s uncomfortable with you getting him naked. Him being clean doesn\u2019t help or hurt his possibilities of asphyxiation and he has every right to be upset with you for doing that to him.", "Maybe he thought you were referring to his penis \"personally didnt think it was a big deal.\" :-)  \n\n\nOtherwise NTA, you helped him get clean and sleep safe. Good sister!", "Your instinct to keep your brother alive outweighed his desire not to be seen naked. NTA.", "NTA, but I think this is a situation that you should say \"I'm sorry that this made you feel uncomfortable\". That's not apologizing for doing it, but showing sympathy for his feelings.", "NTA Did you talk to him. Why he angry? Is there something you left out of the post we should know? Did you touch him inappropriately?", "NAH, You definitely did a good thing by helping your brother. You should admit that the parts that involved you taking off his underwear were not absolutely necessary, and could pretty easily lead to some uncomfortably. You could have stripped him to his underwear and put him in the shower in his underwear, and then towelled him with the underwear still on, then put the towel around his waist and took him to bed. Every part of that would be the same, but with his dong out of sight the whole time. \n\nThat's all kind of irrelevant now, since that didn't happen. You did a good thing, but don't be surprised if there's a bit of awkwardness for a while.", "NTA. Seeing someone naked isn\u2019t a huge deal he will be fine.", "NTA you are the opposite of an asshole, you are a really great sister. You didn't have to do this but you helped him when he screwed up. Seeing each other naked as siblings is completely normal. I know siblings who have no problems going to sauna and nude baths together and nothing is strange with it. \n\nI rather find it strange he is accusing you of this when he should be crying and thanking you. That was an act of love and he makes it awful.", "NTA, I\u2019d be embarassed as your brother but appreciative as well", "NTA, and your brother is an ungrateful arsehole....", "Op first of all you are an amazing older sister quite generally an amazing older sibling.

There's nothing wrong with that I guess he's just feeling bad and he's taking out on you but he shouldn't.", "RIGHT! Lol Id much rather have my siblings look after me in that state than my parents, Id feel more ashamed! \ud83e\udd23", "LOL", "idk what kind of sibling you are, but i wouldnt want my brother to sleep in his own vomit no matter how much he deserved it. and im assuming that she wanted to sleep next to him so that if she heard him choking, she could stop him, but i agree that im not sure it wouldve done much", "genuine question :\n\nwhat in the world is \" not all men energy \"", "No I\u2019m not new.
