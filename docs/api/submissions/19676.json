Being drunk he obviously didnt lock the door that connects to my room so I walk him to see if hes fine but I find him sitting down on the toilet pants pulled down with vomit all over his pants and underwear. My first reaction was to take off the rest of his clothes and get him in the shower and help him rinse off. After the shower I dried him off went to his room got an underwear and put it on for him and laid him next to me to make sure he didnt sleep face up for the rest of the night.

Better for him to be mad at you than for something that could have happened had you not been there. Like possibly falling and hitting his or choking on his own vomit.
