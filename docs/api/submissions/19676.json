If he didnt want vomit filled underwear, he shouldnt have drunk that much\u2026 that sounds like a him problem.\n\nHe drank a lot and then got stripped by someone else. Thats still a him problem but the person who stripped him is wrong no? (Granted it wasnt damaging/life threatening)", "That doesn't help the choking...but what it does do is help remove the Vomit the was all over him. He'd have been even more mad waking up covered in it with it all over his bedding as well.", "Also, I just want to reiterate: you blatantly misrepresented what the other commenter said, so no one has any reason to assume you are commenting in good faith. You've already demonstrated you aren't.\n\n(To clarify: \"so stripping someone naked is universally good\" is NOT AT ALL what the person you replied to said.)", "No, Thats an assumption\u2026 he might have been mad but would have been mad at himself. (Also assumption)\n\nSo we agree that it wasnt life threatening and this extra step is what could have caused the issue. Now if its not life threatening, is stripping someone down naked the right thing to do?", "Yes, you're right. I inferred a few other thoughts that may not be what the commenter was trying to say. The poster may have not came in with the same mind as me.\n\n\\- If OP did nothing wrong, NTA and should repeat it every time someone is drunk. I think that is wrong.\n\n\\- OP did a great job taking action.- OP is a caring sister.- OP is asking if she did anything wrong because brother is upset.- Brother is upset at being stripped naked, (assuming here but i'm sure it's because it wasn't the life threatening part)- Commenters saying (paraphrasing here) Nah good job. Ignore the brother's emotions and feelings about doing more than what's needed to keep him safe.- Other commenters ignoring that he was stripped naked while unconscious and is upset about this. Yes, it saved his life!\n\nOK but he was stripped naked... which is the part he is upset about...\n\nNOT the fact that his life was in danger. He should be very very thankful but he can still be upset, that's allowed."]}
