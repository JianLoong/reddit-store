Huge NTA and I wouldn't try to do him many favors in the future!\n\nBut I suppose you could ask your husband what he'd prefer - if he'd rather see it with you or if it would mean a lot to him to see it with his brother.   But even so, he should still pay you.  Or maybe tell the brother in law that it's his Christmas gift?", "NTA, but if the tickets are a birthday gift to your husband I think he should get to decide who to take.\n\nI bought two concert tickets earlier this year for my partner and let her pick who to take since the artist didn't mean anything to me. It was more special for her to take her sister, and we could do a date night any other day.", "NTA, at this point I would take the offer off the table, go with your husband and enjoy the show.

It's his birthday gift, after all. \n\nIf he wants to go with you, then BIL shouldn't even get the option of using the ticket. If he wants to go with BIL... I mean initially I would have said just give BIL the ticket, because I would consider the entire concert experience husband's gift, not his singular ticket. But with the way he blew up at you, I'd be hard pressed to let him use the ticket at all, but I think it ultimately boils down to who your husband wants to share the experience with.", "NTA- And you should tell him offer is rescinded even if he decides to pay. A grown man should should not be rewarded for throwing a tantrum and being so disrespectful to you.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nFuck him.  Go to the concert just to fuck with his head.", "Yikes.

If he doesn't get over it, you and hubs will have a stellar night being a couple and he won't even cross your mind.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d tell his brother that his behavior was unacceptable and the offer to buy the tickets at market value is off the table completely. Tell him that you were willing to give up a nice date night with your husband, so they could have some bonding time. But expecting you to sacrifice time with your husband, seeing the excitement of you husband, and the money you personally paid for that ticket was selfish and entitled. Tell him that you need some distance for a bit, and I\u2019d tell you husband about this immediately. Don\u2019t hesitate, First he deserves to know what happened. Second there\u2019s a huge possibility that his brother fibs some bits of the story to make you look worse, and that could create even bigger issues between the two of you, and you and your husband.

Scalp his ass, the single ticket now costs 160!", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t even sell it. I\u2019d consider it an AH move to sell it because your husband would probably rather have you with him for his birthday gift than his brother. If I was in his shoes I\u2019d be bummed out if my girlfriend backed out of the date and sold/gave the ticket to one of my friends.", "NTA all the way. You bought the tickets for you and your husband. If his brother wants to go, perfectly fair he needs to pay his way. You're even giving a discount by only charging face value and not face+fees.", "NTA and the price is now doubled to compensate for his verbal abuse. What a jackass", ">they\u2019re paid for already\n\nYes, but it still has value. I\u2019d tell him never mind \u2014 he clearly cares more about demanding free stuff than about the sentiment of the gift, and you are eagerly looking forward to sharing something special with your husband. The chance to enjoy something your hubby loves so much and see him happy is worth much more to you than the ticket is worth, and you were only considering selling it to brother when you thought the brother valued your husband\u2019s happiness as much as you did. Now that you know he was just looking for a free night out, you realize you\u2019ll appreciate the concert more than he could.", "OP, talk to your husband. If my BIL spoke to me like that, that would be the last time my husband or I spoke to him. He can't just be allowed to scream at you and demand things from you...", "After the tantrum I would let him know the ticket is still available, but now at 20 times the price haha.", "Even if a concert is not completely sold out, tickets on the 'aftermarket' are usually more expensive than face value, but if it's sold out? Take a look at what tickets for the Taylor Swift events are sold for...", ">You'll buy him some band merch while you're there!\n\nI wouldn't do that. He doesn't deserve this.\n\nThe pictures, like u/NicNikKnit suggested, on the other hand, will be way more appropriate.", ">if he wants to go there\u2019s a tantrum tax \n\nYou are much nicer than me. After the tantrum, I would have told him 'Sorry, but you had your chance. You can't have the ticket anymore.'", "Right? I have gone NC for less than that! Someone screaming at me? Nah. Kick rocks.", "It\u2019s very normal. Everyone I know does this", "Why settle for a car? \n\nFind the most expensive house in the world, and demand that for free, given that the owner already paid for it.", "NTA.

That is a lot of money.", " NTA but I would tell your husband about his brother screaming at you.", "Nta. The brother in law now needs to pay the ah fee.  Figure out what it is and that's the cost of the ticket.", "NTA. BIL is acting like gross leech. Dropping all those hints like that. For that alone, trying to worm his way into the concert makes him the AH. But screaming at you when you made a reasonable offer is beyond. Even a night out seeing a band you think is meh can be a fun night out...ESPECIALLY if you're with someone who really LOVES that band (it's fun to see the people I love enjoy things). \n\nIf he changes his mind and offers to buy if off you, I'd double the price. Gatekeeping Tax.", "NTA\n\nand OP... talk to your husband about this. \n\nhe needs to understand how is brother is treating his wife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso it's perfectly fine to have someone pay for a ticket they're taking over.", "NTA smh the audacity of some people...", "and after the tantrum, the ticket price just went up", "Ask your BIL why he expects a present for your husband's birthday...", "Yeah, OP should inform husband of tantrum, revoke the offer to sell, enjoy date night.
