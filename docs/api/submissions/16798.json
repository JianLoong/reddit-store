You have a guest room. There's no need for them to be in your room. It's not like you expect them to sleep on the couch or pull out bed.", "NTA. You have a guest room. They're guests, even if they're assisting you as part of their stay. \n\nTell your MIL to get over herself. \n\nOh, do learn to discuss not fight with your spouse. That'll get you to agreement sooner.", "NTA - Why in the world would they even want to sleep in your bed when you have a guest room readily available? It was understandable when your wife was single and the only other option was a couch, but now it\u2019s just weird.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would her parents *want* to sleep in your bed when there\u2019s a perfectly good guest room? That\u2019s soooooooo weird to me.", "INFO\n\nThe guest room and your daughter's bedrooms are on separate floors. How old is your daughter and how old are your in-laws? Would your daughter have needed any sort of attention that maybe your MIL didn't want to be going up and down stairs in the middle of the night?", "If you *do* end up with the in-laws staying at your place-put a lock on your bedroom door. They don\u2019t need to be there. They don\u2019t need to be snooping in your bedside table drawers, (or\nwhatever), to see what little things you keep there. \n\nYour room is your private sanctuary, and they have no business being in there. NTA\n\nOh. yea, nanny cam in the corner. In case they get creative and call a locksmith. Just sayin.", "You have a guest room and yet your mil wants to sleep in the bed that her daughter and yourself \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4c in \ud83d\ude33. Definitely NTA. Only thing I can think of is mil wanted to sleep on the same floor as your daughter in case she needs them.", "NTA. There's zero reason why they'd need to sleep in your bed. This is weird AF.", "Omg I literally had this exact same thing happen with my mom. But it's never been a thing. I've always had a guest room wherever I lived. She was so baffled and offended and made such a big deal about it when I said sleep in the guest room while you're housesitting... like mom, thats my marital bed.... ew wtf.\n\nNTA and it has to be a generational thing? Idk", "NTA, this is a leftover poverty mindset. When you are poor, you typically have one nice bed/room, and a elder guest would feel entitled to it out of respect. \n\nThat isn't a problem any more, lots of people have guest rooms, with nice mattresses and en suite bathrooms etc. \n\nNo fucking way I'm letting my parents or my wifes sleep in my bed. NTA.", "NTA. Close the door of the master bedroom and tell them they can sleep in the guest room", "NTA. It would be different if you didn\u2019t have a guest room. But you do, so I\u2019m really baffled as to why her parents want to sleep in your bed? It\u2019s\u2026.weird.", "Why are there people who are so insistent about sleeping in someone elses bed?? NTA\n\nHonestly, sorry to yuck on someone's comforts but I think its super weird. Like.. thats my bed, my skin cells, my late night farts, my sleepy drool. Obvi we have clean linens and such but just.. \n\nThe guest bedroom is specifically for guests. Its supposed to be a nice gesture. 'Look I made a space specifically so you could have the same creature comforts here, as you would at home.' And that should be enough. \n\nSomeone genuinley answer my question.. WHY do others wana sleep in someone elses bed so bad? Is an 'authority' thing? Or a 'respect elders' thing? Is the Master bedroom really that important to someone status? I dont understand it at all. Very confused. Would love some genuine insight. \n\nOP. Did your wife explain why it was such a big deal at first? I gotta know", "**NTA.** Boundaries. Your bed (and your room for that matter) being off limits is a perfectly reasonable boundary. Considering you have a guest room I just have no words as to why someone would want to sleep in your bed and not a guest bed. \n\nFurthermore, even without the guest room I still wouldn't offer my bed to guests. Call me strange, but I don't want to share where I sleep and have playtime with my spouse. That's what couches and air mattresses are for.\n\nIf I were you, I'd consider getting a lock for my underwear drawer as well.", "NTA \nYour house, your rules, as long as you have a suitable guest room to compensate family for doing you a favour", "NTA because you have a guestroom,  as long as it has adequate bedding for the parents. \n\nIf you didn't have a spare room, or it only has a twin bed for example, then yes they should be allowed.", "NTA \n\nYou have a guest room for a reason. They can stay there. Right before you leave, install a lock on the bedroom door without telling your wife and take the keys with you.", "NTA that's exactly the reason why guest rooms exists in the first place, for guests to sleep in", "It\u2019s a weird flex that some parents have of feeling the older generation are superior to their children who must pay their respects. It\u2019s not a healthy relationship to have where you\u2019re not considered in charge in your own home- I imagine it extends to other aspects of your wife\u2019s relationship with her parents.\n\nNTA", "Yes I want you to do us a massive favor but you have to follow all my restrictions.  \n\nI know I'm going against the popular opinion but they are helping you. Maybe the GR bed sucks.  YTA. Find another house sitter and pay them. Then decide if allowing them in your BR is worth it.", "NTA, but there has to be some missing detail here. \n\nIf the guest room has an appropriate bed and bath, why would your in-laws insist or even want to sleep in the master bedroom?", "NTA\n\nWhile you provide best guest accomodation, the guest are requesting even more. Its your privacy which is broken with them sleeping in your bed. \n\nBe aware that the conflict betwen you and your loved wife can harm your relation.\n\nNot easy to solve as long your SO is keeping her position.", "Nta. I think it's weird the mom would want to sleep in your bed. If you have a guest room with a bed to fit both parents, I don't understand what the problem was.", "NTA. My bedroom is my haven, I don't want ANYONE in that bed but me, my husband, our future kid, and our cats. Your future grandson was conceived in that bed, MiL, ya sure you wanna sleep there?", "You're NTA. You have every right to not allow others to sleep in your own bed.", "NTA because your house, your rules.  I personally would not care.  When my friend visits from out of state I give her my room and take the air mattress downstairs in the living room.  My spare room is now an office.  I'm working on getting a smaller desk and twin in there but until then, guests get my room. That's MY preference.  We are all entitled to our own and yours should be respected.", "NTA and i cant understand why they would even want to unless the guest room is a straw mattress on a pallet and your room has a 10k magic bed.", "NTA\n\n\"Not sure why you insist on sleeping where I have sex with your daughter.\"", "NTA - If this was a situation where there was no other beds for them to sleep in, then your wife would be right but you guys have a guest bedroom (a nice one considering it's got a bathroom attached).  \n\nWhy do they need to sleep in your bed? If it were me, i'd lock my door to prevent them from even entering that room.", "Do you have a lock on your door? What\u2019s to stop her doing it anyway? Does she stick to boundaries? I\u2019d be telling her you\u2019ve hidden a camera in your bedroom\u2026.you know, in case someone who\u2019s not supposed to go in there\u2026does.\n\nNTA", "INFO: what size bed does the guest room have?", "ESH. Change the sheets ffs. They are doing you a favour for free and you shouldn't really mind but on their part it is at least weird that they insist to sleep in your bedroom.", "NTA,\n\nYou have a guest room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's the only bedroom on the ground floor and I can't use the stairs and neither can they. So it is a pain but in that case there is no choice. \n\nIn yours why would anyone want to even do that. \n\nStand your ground on thus.
