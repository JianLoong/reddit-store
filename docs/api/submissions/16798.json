All the sofas and the shower too. Should I cordon off my whole house because of it?", "What if we make love on the kitchen table, can other people sit there?", "If they didn't have a guest room it would be different. It's pretty normal for house sitters to use THE bed when they stay over if there's just the one bedroom.", "Where are you getting that info, I don't see it in any of the comments. \n\nWaiiiiit are you Grandma?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cufh7/comment/jjj5mli/", "They\u2019re probably at least in their 50s. Lots of people have back/knee problem or poor night vision at that age. And no one particularly *enjoys* hauling ass up and down stairs.", "For convenience and safety\u2019s sake, this is the answer. \nImagine if one of the IL\u2019s came to grief on the stairs especially if they were carrying the baby.", "I didn't say that. Literally did not. No need for your .... either. As much as family make it out like its not a big deal, it is. To go to someones house and watch your kids, it is big ask. And they say oh yea no problem, then they start acting weird like expecting to sleep in OP's bed. It's probably not worth it to get the free child care from these relatives. So many people are suggesting putting a lock on the door or putting up cameras. That kind of thing just makes the situation worse. You just don't ask these kind of people. It's not worth it.", "I adore this logic, until you take into account how many couples can't make the bedroom. If that's the case my guest room is the only safe place for anyone to sleep in my house lmao. Especially since its only us that live here. ( both our kids are grown and we've lived solo for the last 7 years, we moved into this place 3 years ago, so no suitable sleeping surface save the guest bed....newly purchased....hasn't been used for more than sleep). Said all that to say.....my parents, before my mom passed 2 years ago, came to visit and see our new place. Stayed later than originally planned and needed to crash here. Due to my moms health, and because ours was the only bed in the house at the time, i insisted they sleep in our room. I put clean sheets on for them and my husband and i took the couch. I have also slept in their bed, albeit solo. With all that confusion said, if op and wife are not comfortable with the ils sleeping in their bed then sorry mil the answer is your sleeping in the guest room as you are, in fact, a guest!! NTA, you pay for the house and everything in it. Mil can suck it up or she can suck it, either way your bed is off limits!", "You can get apps that do it, just need an old iphone and to set it up. It's what we do for watching the dogs.", "Yup! I have a nanny cam in my lizard\u2019s enclosure that was less than $35. \ud83d\ude02", "Was about to say \"What has been seen, can never be unseen...\" There are things I don't want to know about my parents, ever.", "He just has to be up front about the fact that there is a camera, providing OP trusts MIL not to simply trash the entire room-- a move that would damage MIL's relationship with her daughter, too, and might not be worth it, but if OP's wife thinks her mom would pull that kind of move, then they obviously know MIL better than anyone on reddit."]}
