Even if the sheets are clean.", "If you don\u2019t have alternative childcare, install a lock to keep her out. She will definitely sleep in there regardless if that\u2019s her attitude.", "Sounds like you understand her. \n\nHold your boundaries on the small stuff so all your arguments are stupid, otherwise they happen on the big things and rip the family apart.", "Do not back down op. I guarantee you that this is more than just about a bed with your MIL.", "Nta. But you do realize that they're going to sleep in it anyway while you're gone..... It's pretty gross thinking about other people sweating and skin flaking in my bed where I'm intimate. Idk. Beds are just very personal spaces. Going to have to get someone else to watch the kids and be prepared for the fallout", "If you still want them to watch the kid I would straight up lock the door to your bedroom, with a pad lock or keypad lock.", "That explains it. NTA. And your in-laws and your wife need to learn boundaries and respect for someone's space.", "Your MIL is wrong and she doesn't get everything she want.  I have never heard of visiting parents sleeping in host (grown child)'s bed when there is a guest room available.  Her reasoning is absurd and your wife is being a doormat to even think her mum's request is normal.", "She does know that\u2019s where y\u2019all fuck, right?", "And even if they agree to stay in the guest room, they will be sleeping in your bed as soon as you are gone.", "Explain how your daughter was made in that bed and then ask why she's so desperate to sleep in it. That's just weird. NTA", "They are gonna sleep in the bed anyways and claim they forgot", "Lock the door to your bedroom before you leave if you\u2019re going to have them babysit. There\u2019s nothing they need in there and even if you have to buy a new lock it\u2019s still cheaper than paying for childcare.", "If she\u2019s like this, I would be very afraid that she would be snooping through all of my things tbh. \n\nNTA - hold your boundaries because if you relent on this, it\u2019s only going to get worse.", "You should make a big mess of the bed before you leave lol", "Bullshit. Also they gonna sleep in your bed anyway uess you deadbolt it lol", "100% this!! Go as far as leaving sex toys in the bed", "Yea yes ye do this and the nanny cam and if they snoop it\u2019ll be funny to see their reactions and if not oh well no harm done", "Yes.... plant them.... and fake...", "I'm still laughing while typing!", "Sounds like a mindset that leads to great communication and healthy relationships!", "I think this shines light on a cultural nuance which might be useful for OP. As odd as I find the MIL\u2019s request, it could well be a cultural thing.", "More INFO:  How old are the kids?", "How old is your child?  Because a young child is a good reason to be on the same floor.", "Possibly because the child they are there to watch is very young and they want to be in the same floor.", "It sort of is if the kids are upstairs and the grandparents are old enough not want to have to run up and down the stairs every time the kids need something.", "I get it. But this is also them doing a favor to OP. And if it's a deal breaker then OP finds another person to stay there. \n\nMaybe OP thinks the guest room is perfectly good but I expect the IL don't. Maybe a queen is too small. Mattress too hard or soft. OP has not said why they ask but since they've asked multiple times it doesn't seem like a lark.", "I cat-sat/house-sat in junior high, and high school. Every time I walked in, the kitty would take me on a tour of the house (and would be upset if I didn't follow her!) \n\nWe did a circuit of each bedroom, but even my 12 year old self never bounced on the beds or opened drawers or anything, because...why?\n\nFound out years later they had a camera system one of their kids had rigged as a project in their teens, and I kept the job in part because I never \"snooped\"...meanwhile I was in kid paradise with a couch, control of a TV and could read books and drink their soda in peace while petting a chill cat!", "Thank you!!", "Some of them are *so* weird that they don't even grasp the principle of subjectivity and that there exists different opinions than their own. They often think (and act) like their opinions are the only singular valid ones, going so far as to call other Redditors by some derogatory names. Those are the worst.", "This is what I came here to say. Her sense of entitlement is so off the charts that at this point it won't matter if you tell her no, she's going to do it anyway, because she somehow sees it as her \"right.\" No more babysitting for grandma. And put a lock on your bedroom door. It's apparent she thinks boundaries don't apply to her.", "Way more!", "It isn't just a bed. It's the marital bed.\n\nJudaism teaches that sex between a married couple is an act of worship of God who created the act of sex not just to create children but to deepen the relationship between a couple. The marital bed is where that worship takes place. Other people do not get to sleep where a husband and wife make love.", "[removed]", "OP should hide the adult toys too...", "You saying this reminded me of all the people who would want to use their parents beds to have sex when they were teenagers and I always thought it was really gross. And the thought of using someone else's bed (other than the person that I'm having sex with) that they sleep in for sex has always icked me out. And of the times that we deemed my bed too small for stuff, I've used the floor.", "Alternatively, I think you'd have to strip the master bed and store the linens elsewhere when you leave...which is crazy, I admit, but they are totally going to sleep in the master bedroom, and every protest from OP is only going to make the act more \"delicious\" to the MIL...\n\nOP is NTA...I also wouldn't be surprised if a locked door ended with a broken door because \"they heard a noise\" or something (followed by them sleeping in OPs master bedroom.)", "And if she doesn't sleep in there, you can bet she will be snooping!", "And a nanny cam. OP can say that it automatically activates when both their cell phones leave the house or some bs. Or not say anything at all.", "This is very very true. You give an inch for family unity sake and they will take a mile until you reach a hill you\u2019re willing to die on, and it\u2019s usually the big, meaningful shit by then.", "Children died in a house fire in my community not long ago because the parents (sleeping on another floor of the home) could not reach their children. They were young enough to be too frightened to try and get out on their own and hid under their bed. \nThere are plenty of other circumstances that could occur where being within earshot of sleeping children is beneficial.", "Genius!!!!", "Get the camera you can speak from (Blink), and when you eventually see her terrified of what she\u2019s seen\u2026 just start manically laughing and scare the shit out of her haha", "\ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude02", "Well lucky for me my wife agrees,our house is our house and we set the terms and conditions,if our parents don't like it then they can bugger off and book into a hotel or stay in their own house.", "Perhaps to be on the same level of the house as the kids, especially if they are young?", "That would be logical, but she doesn\u2019t give that reason. She\u2019s  offended because she can\u2019t have something. And OPs other comments state she\u2019s the type that wants her own way.", "They\u2019re still guests in another persons house. Yes they\u2019re doing them a favour but that doesn\u2019t mean they still get their own way. What about when they visit without doing a favour? Is OP supposed to stay in the guest room and still give up his own bed?", "What next is Op supposed to give up to really show appreciation for this favor- his phone password?", "Pretty funny they were snooping to make sure you weren\u2019t snooping \ud83e\udd23 also that cat sounds amazing", "My cat does the same thing whenever we move. She stays up all night and scopes the new apartment out, and then gives us a nightly, poorly timed \"tour\" (like 2:30 am).", "I\u2019m not religious, but it\u2019s a special space. Where you and your spouse do it is a private environment.", "We don't have to bring religion into this for it to be weird, thanks", "Unless OP is Jewish I don't know how this applies. You can't say \"it's important in Judaism therefore it's important to everyone.\"", "The point you\u2019re making also criticizes ops child sleeping in the bed with them", "u/weightheavy4572 is a comment stealing bot", "Ew I totally forgot about that but you\u2019re so right. Can\u2019t believe people had sex on their parents bed I can\u2019t imagine even thinking of that. I\u2019d rather have sex in a dog cage than my parents bed", "It\u2019s their way of rebelling. While I never did it on a parent\u2019s bed, I did have sex on other furniture around the house. Hindsight has shown me it\u2019s not really a great way to rebel, but I also did it since my gf at that time was basically a fish so it was the only way to make things more interesting", "Cameras in the bedroom while you're away.", "Yeah. I'd get a camera set up in there even if there's a lock on the door because she is definitely going to try snooping.", "If that was the issue dont you think that would have been mentioned instead of being offended? Personally if I felt me being in a specific room for a child's safety I would make that clear not make it about my feelings. If MIL brought this up at any point I agree with you but it doesn't seem like that's the reasoning.", "The number of N T A votes that seemingly cannot conceive of any reason why the ILs would want to be upstairs makes me think there are not a lot of parents participating in this discussion.", "This could backfire, big time. What if they like the kinky handcuffs and you're watching the camera filming this??", "That\u2019s not a good enough reason to insist on sleeping in someone\u2019s bedroom lol", "When they are visiting, they stay in a hotel or the guest room.   If OP doesn't want them in his BR then have his parents house sit.  Not even certain why they need someone, unless they are looking after kids or pets.  I'm probably close to age as the IL and we don't like a queen bed.", "Right I don't want to think about my parent having been in the same bed that I do scandalous things in \ud83d\ude30", "Bruh, where am originally from, you leave your bed to your parents as it is the most comfortable place in the house and well taken care of by default. If your wife per said to her husband \u201cam not comfortable your parents sleeping in our bed\u201d and the husband listened god forbid to his wife and agreed, then that means by default  the parents did a terrible job raising him. Not only that but, people will start talking behind your back and you would be the new gossip in town, the guy who listens to his wife not his mama reputation lol. Reminds me of a well known phrase among the locals to describe a guy who listens to his wife not his mother where the literal translation in English is: \u201c the clits (referring to the wife) has beaten the tits (referring to the mom)\u201d lol", "I think it\u2019s just expressing that the marital bed is more than just where people do it. It\u2019s where they build up their relationship as well. Especially when kids come it often becomes a place you do date night, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think this was an out of bounds response.", "That is clearly not what they where implying. The idea was that the marital bed serves additional purposes and they used an anecdote of their experience being Jewish to explain the idea. \n\nPeople can mention their religion or a belief they have, just saying a belief isn\u2019t an automatic \u201cconvert or agree with my religion!\u201d", "Chill. They\u2019re just sharing their belief.", "Just because you don't follow a certain religion doesn't mean it doesn't contain truths that might apply to your life.\n\nThe founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, said that if you want to meet God, serve the poor people. That is why their temples often incorporate soup kitchens, community clinics, and relief services. \n\nIn the Koran it is written that Allah instructs, \"Guarantee for me six things and I will guarantee Paradise for you: tell the truth when you speak, fulfill your promises, be faithful when you are trusted, safeguard your private parts, lower your gaze, and withhold your hands (from harming others).\"\n\nShinto teaches that gods (*kami*) are present in nature, and that nature should therefore be protected and preserved. People should spend more time in nature to communicate with kami. It is said to clear the mind and spirit of evil intentions.", "Nanny cameras are pretty inexpensive nowadays", "Ooh that is a great idea!!!  If you tell them not to sleep in your bed, put a lock on the door, have a very nice guest room and cameras in your bedroom while you are away, the possibilities are many.  \n\nInevitably, after viewing the footage and letting them catch hints that you knew they slept in your bed and what they did in your bedroom, they will be hard pressed to justify trespassing.  Imagine if you told a story about someone who liked dancing naked on beds and what an interesting quirky friend that was, had one if them danced naked on your bed, it would be obvious you knew that happened on your bed.  But how could they say so?  Delicious!", "Bump", "I don't think op bothered to ask why....", "That\u2019s what makes it about power. The mother wants the son in law to feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s weird.", "I would be more concerned after I return, thinking about the scandalous things the parents did in my bed.  \ud83e\udd22", "And vice versa. I would be very uncomfortable sleeping in the bed my kid shares with her partner. Like, MIL is aware that her child is banging her spouse in that bed. Just....no\nNTA and OP needs to get wife to set boundaries. From OPs comment, MIL is the kind who desperately needs them", "And if they're Jewish they're definitely not trying to convert anyone", "Might be setting himself for seeing something that will burn his eyes out though  ;\\_)", "Still if I was concerned about a child's safety and was told no I would at least bring up child's safety not my feelings.", "Yep. As a Jewish person proselytizing is an absolute glowing red line of do not proselytize. It\u2019s why conversion to Judaism takes years is driven by the conversion student\u2019s own motivation. If they decide not to continue no harm no foul in fact some rabbis will flat up ask you if you think converting is even worth it because being Jewish comes with so many additional responsibilities and rules to uphold."]}
