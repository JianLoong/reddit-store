{"id": 1354, "submission_id": "ymcqcu", "title": "AITA for blocking my assistant's promotion?", "selftext": "I run a team with several assistants. One of them (Dan) was not actually hired to be an assistant.  The project he was initially assigned to was closed, so he was reassigned to my team temporarily while another project opened up. He was told by the new project lead (Boss) that he needed to give 110% while at this posting even though he was not hired for it, as Dan needed the legitimacy of doing things the right way for his new project (which would involve advising other teams -including my own - how to improve their workflows).\n\nDan started out well but totally mailed it in over the past few weeks, to the point where I and my other assistant (Jane) had to double check and correct his work constantly. Generally, I point out deficiencies directly and it doesn't get any farther than that. I want good effort, but do not expect perfection. My corrections apparently irritated him however. This week, I was telling Jane that it was surprising how often I had to remind my other team leaders \"not to be a jerk\" when complaining about an issue with upper management when he interjected from across the office \"isn't that ironic?\" I asked Dan what he meant by that - did he think I was a jerk or something? He smirked and said \"sometimes you aren't.\" I was irritated but was not about to go into his deficiencies in front of the entire team, so I left it at that.\n\nDuring this week's regular call with Boss however, he asked how Dan was doing. I told Boss that Dan had been mailing it in and we had been cleaning up after him. Boss was concerned and asked if I felt Dan could work independently, since Boss often manages this team from several states away. I told Boss that, although I had wholeheartedly endorsed 2 other assistants to be promoted to his team over the past 2 years, I did not feel Dan would perform as well, and I would be concerned with his ability to work independently without oversight.\n\nThis morning, Boss notified upper management and Dan that he would not be joining his team. When notified, Dan was quite upset and asked why I wouldn't just tell him if he wasn't doing well.   \n\nMy response was that every correction I gave him was a notification. I do feel bad that he will not be getting his promotion, and am sure that he feels I am a total AH and was responding to his comment.\n\nSo, I ask Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1667601686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymcqcu/aita_for_blocking_my_assistants_promotion/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
