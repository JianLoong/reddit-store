Also who the hell would start yelling like that just because you didn't park perfectly well in the dark? If he's unhappy, he could offer you to practice.

My dad used to take me practice driving, and the amount of yelling over everything made it to the point that I just never practiced with him anymore. On a vacation about 5 yrs ago, while at a restaurant, the topic of driving came up, and dad said he wants me to pass my permit already then, and how he was going to get me going again regardless.\nI suppose I was bolder because were in public, so surely he wouldn't get terrible upset or do his usual things he does whenever I say anything different from his wishes. Well, he definitely got abit angry and did declare if \"hes not teaching me, then your not driving\".\nOver the years I've lived with him, especially as soon as I turned 16, he threatened if I wasn't to get a job or get my license, he'd beat me till my bones couldn't way and take away everything in my room, even stating he'd keep me there till what bruises were visible were gone before sending me to school, and demanding rent.\nOf course, 'he was drunk' or, 'he had a bad day at work', or my favorites, 'well maybe you should work harder, and maybe he wouldn't have to be in a mood'. With all this behavior, the funny thing was he only stopped being so hateful and use me as his punching bag was in the months closer I turn 18. He then left me be, even stating 'shes a adult, she makes her own decisions'. He knew how he was completely, yet now he's apparently upset I don't go and see him anymore after I moved to my grandparents. \n\nI ranted, I apologize on that. But point is- don't let anything like this get to you. Its not your fault, and more so, you have the right to feel as you do. Driving can be stressful, especially if you're still a new person to it, he couldn't get you to listen to his demands and take what verbal abuse he wish to get you, stand on that. Don't drive him anywhere and hopefully his drive let's him reflect- but in my experience,  a narasasist will blame the ground they walk on and the air they breath before they take accountability.", "NTA, you are a new driver, at this point you dont really even know how to drive.

Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\nBallast!\n\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\n\nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.", "Older sister, as oldest, has probably been tasked (either spoken or unspoken) with keeping dad level in the past.  She's been expected to teach younger siblings her ways.  Just because she's an adult doesn't mean she's been able to break out of the mindset that dad's behavior is normal for an adult.  Not excusing it entirely, but breaking out of that level of at-home problems takes years.", "Bot", "You just described my life.
