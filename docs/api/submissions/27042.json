Our sister, Jennifer (31F), has one daughter, Emma (15F). She\u2019s the only grandchild and nibling and we all adore her. Jen has made some questionable decisions in life and has struggled a bit but we\u2019ve always been there to help her. Jennifer was just 16 when she had Emma so she lived with Michael and his husband until she was three while Jen was in school. I live near Michael and Emma saw me more than her own mother during that time.\n\nWhen Emma was seven, Jennifer married a man with a daughter who is the same age as Emma and two younger kids.  They\u2019re not poor but with four kids they don\u2019t have a lot of disposable income. Jennifer\u2019s step kids have everything they need but not always everything they want. However, Michael, our parents, and I can afford to spoil Emma so we get her pretty much anything she wants. Despite this, she\u2019s not spoiled and is a very well adjusted young lady. We give the stepkids gifts on birthdays and Christmas but Emma has more expensive things than them because we can afford to buy her a lot more than their parents. We also have a college fund for Emma that should cover most or all of her college costs.\n\nJennifer is usually glad that we love her daughter and understands that we don\u2019t have the same bond with her step kids and cannot afford to spend as much money on them as we do on Emma. Jen\u2019s husband does not like us very much. He is homophonic and doesn\u2019t want Michael and his husband to be around his kids too much. He also thinks I\u2019m a deviant because I\u2019m single by choice, live with my best friend, and don\u2019t want kids. We\u2019ve argued with him many times because he thinks we\u2019re a bad influence on Emma and his kids. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what my sister sees in this guy.\n\nOur latest argument happened because I bought Emma a homecoming dress. Her stepdad doesn\u2019t like the boy she\u2019s going with and told her that he\u2019s not spending any of his money on a stupid dance. He doesn\u2019t want to seem like a hypocrite, so he\u2019s not buying his daughter a dress either. The dress cost about $500 including accessories. Emma\u2019s stepsister had to buy her own dress. Michael also hosted a little after party for Emma\u2019s friends. \n\nYesterday Emma\u2019s stepdad called me and said that he doesn\u2019t like my favoritism and if Michael and I can\u2019t do as much for his kids then we need to do less for Emma. I basically told him to f*ck off (but in a somewhat polite way) and he is currently mad at me. Jen said he told Emma that she needs to stay away from. Jen thinks I could\u2019ve at least bought her stepdaughter a cheaper dress but I don\u2019t see why I should. She has two sets of parents who could\u2019ve bought her a dress and I don\u2019t have much of a relationship with her.

It does sound a bit rough for the other three kids, but without more details it is hard to know how unfair it is.   \n\n\nBut the dress? NTA. You can buy her a dress because her step dad wouldn\u2019t.", "NTA. \n\nYou really don\u2019t owe your step niece anything.", "NTA, BUUTTTT this screams favoritism and I can completely understand why your sister feels that way. If they\u2019re trying to live as one cohesive family and her family is always treating Emma like a princess and the others as less than it\u2019s going to cause division. The other children shouldn\u2019t be punished because their dad is an asshole. \n\nI have three nephews and a niece. My niece is not blood related, but I would *never* treat her any differently than my nephews. I wasn\u2019t around for most of her young life, her father married my sister when she was about 9 or 10. She was immediately family though. I don\u2019t always see eye to eye with her father, but I\u2019d never fault her for his behavior. \n\nWhile personally I don\u2019t agree with how you handle things, ultimately you\u2019re money you\u2019re choice.", "NTA, your sister\u2019s husband definitely is. But if I were you, I\u2019d seriously consider working to establish a relationship with your niece\u2019s step-siblings to whatever extent you can, especially the step-sister in question. For a number of reasons:\n\nThese are your niece\u2019s siblings and a big part of her day-to-day life. Part of being invested in her well-being now means investment in theirs, too. They\u2019re all living together as siblings, which means that a significant discrepancy in gifts might start to build understandable resentment toward her, especially from siblings close in age. You don\u2019t want that, for your niece\u2019s sake or theirs. $500 is extravagant for a homecoming outfit. Even if that\u2019s within your means, you might want to consider the cost relative to what other kids will be wearing, especially other kids in her household. A $50-200 budget would still be very generous, and you could afford to offer it to both girls. Especially because they\u2019re both suffering from the same sad parenting failures. Your BIL\u2019s issue with your nieces\u2019 BF also led to his refusal to buy his own daughter a dress\u2014which resulted in unfairness to both girls. Bringing me to my next point.\n\nI\u2019d consider establishing a relationship with these kids because it sounds like they\u2019re really going to need it. Their dad\u2019s a dick, it seems like your sister\u2019s not really the best decision-maker and isn\u2019t shielding the kids from his bigoted, assholeish behaviors. I had an amazing roommate who was always taking care of her nieces and nephews, some of whom were the kids of her sister\u2019s ex-husband (her bio niece\u2019s step-siblings). It didn\u2019t matter to her that they weren\u2019t biologically her sister\u2019s kids, or even that her sister had divorced their dad. She was still their aunt, and one of the few adults in their lives who consistently showed up. It made a world of a difference in their lives. I\u2019d find teenagers sleeping on our couch because their parents had kicked them out for some ridiculous reason or other, and they could easily have spent the night somewhere unsafe. She was there to secretly get them the things they needed (personal hygiene products, etc.) that their control-freak parents wouldn\u2019t, tutor with schoolwork and college essays, pick them up when they needed an emergency ride (no questions asked), cheer them on when their parents flaked. It was one of the sweetest things I\u2019ve seen. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to commit to that level, but if you try to extend your aunty love to all your niece\u2019s siblings, you could end up with three bonus niblings and boost your niece\u2019s stability at home. You\u2019re an adult and don\u2019t have to bow to your BIL\u2019s stupid commandments, but your niece does have to live under his roof and his mood will affect her. Your well-meaning gifts could make her a target of his ire, so consider what you can do to mitigate that (gift discreetly and strategically). Plus, how satisfying would it be to know you\u2019d become a better and more beloved adult figure in his kids\u2019 lives than he is?\n\nEdit: I say this all from personal experience, as a former kid with a volatile step-parent who hated when I received gifts. He can make the poor kid\u2019s life miserable if he feels she\u2019s getting \u2018more than she deserves.\u2019 Is it fair? No, but it\u2019s sometimes the reality. Discretion when gifting in this situation is its own gift. Downvote all you want, but that was my (painful) lived experience for years.", "Jen's husband and children have been in your family for 8 years, and you still view them as outsiders?!?\nYTA.", "The stepfather sounds awful.  You need to sit your sister down and tell her what you said here about what has been going on--that she allows her husband to disrespect you and your brother when you have done so much for her over the years.  Let her know that it seems like her husband is trying to distance her and her daughter from you and your brother.  \n\nBut YTA.  The stepsister is not responsible for her father.  Think about her situation.  She lives with parents who have chosen to have child after child they can't afford.  I know you're not responsible in any way for your chaotic sister's decision to get involved with her husband but the situation is what it is.  There IS a stepsister who is living Cinderella.  \n\nThe kind thing to do would have been to make some gesture to the stepsister to show her that she is part of the family (because she is part of the family).  You could have spent $50 less on your niece's dress and covered the step-sister's hair, for example, and your brother could have bought her shoes.\n\nThe kids have not grown up together so you don't have a close relationship with the stepsister.  Because of that, you shouldn't feel like you have to give her what you give your niece.  But you should at least make a gesture so that this poor kid with the awful father and a stepmother and stepsister she's expected to live with has a little light in her life.", "I\u2019m sorry but IMO you\u2019re TAH. I understand that you have a closet relationship to your niece but I feel for her step sister and brother .\nAccording to what you wrote you never tried to bond with them and you don\u2019t like their father. I understand their reasons .\nBut your sister is their mother now and you don\u2019t care that you and your brother spoil Emma but don\u2019t really care about her siblings.\nAre you sure that your brother in law don\u2019t like you and your brother because he is close minded? Did he tell you himself or you sister told you?\nOr did you just guessed it?\n\nIf I was your brother in law I would hate you and your brother for the way you treat him and his children.", "YTA ur purposely making it harder for their family to blend.
