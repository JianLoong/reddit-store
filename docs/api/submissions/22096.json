Hold up, hold up. There's so much more to unpack than the babysitting ambush here. Your mother calling you a bitch? Complaining when you don't do as she asks, the way she orders you to? She sounds like a peach. Where's those babies fathers in this? You're not her maid and not their parent. And she should not be badmouthing you to your aunt. Run girl.", "NTA. She was trying to use you for free childcare, and you called her on it, thus embarrassing her. That's why she reacted; she knew she was in the wrong.", "NTA.
