{"id": 28695, "submission_id": "175bia8", "title": "AITA for asking gf to not send me selfies?", "selftext": "My (29M) girlfriend \"Tina\" (25F) and I have been dating for about a year.\n\nBackground, I was previously in an 8 year relationship. My ex cheated on me, I found messages on Instagram, tried to stick it out but in the end things weren't the same. It has made me a lot less trusting.\n\nTina was in a relationship with a guy, \"Rex\", who didn't worry about her talking to guys or anything, he treated well and by all accounts had a great relationship. They dated for 2 years.They have maintained a very close friendship which is where the problems began for me. \n\nShe talks about him often, and it has felt to me especially in the beginning of the relationship that she wasn't over him and was comparing me to Rex.\n\nTina and I stay 45min apart so we only see each other on weekends where she will stay at my place Friday to Monday. I also drive through to see her in the middle of the week for date night.\n\nSo this past weekend we were talking about trying out a new restaurant, and she had apparently discussed it with Rex after I had brought it up and said that he highly recommended the place. I'd always been under the impression that they spoke infrequently and usually just to catch up but this made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI told her the conversation with Rex made me uncomfortable and I would feel better knowing what was said rather than letting my imagination run wild. She said okay and showed me the messages. Firstly they send massive paragraphs to each other whereas I've told Tina that her messages to me seem very short (3 or 4 words) and she tends to ignore a lot of the content of my messages, she said that she hates texting.\n\nThe issue was her sending him selfies. With us being in a medium distance relationship, we send each other little selfies as we go about our day letting them know we are thinking about them and it makes my day when I get a photo of her out the blue and it makes me smile.\n\nI felt the selfies were a personal thing between us and it felt like she was taking a \"relationship level\" gesture and doing it with her ex.\nI felt betrayed and a little stupid for having thought it was something special between us. She didn't see the issue with it and said \"it's just a photo\".\n\nI explained that I wasn't okay with it and that it would need to stop if she wanted to be in relationship with me.\n\nAfter the fight she sent me a selfie and this is where I might be the AH. I said \"I appreciate the gesture but Id prefer if she didn't send me selfies anymore because it felt like it was no longer \"our thing\" and that I didn't want to be reminded of her sending photos to Rex.\"\n\nShe got upset and cried saying I was taking it too far by not wanting her to send me photos. I feel like if it didn't mean anything to her when she was sending them to Rex why do they mean so much now?\n\nSo AITA for asking her to not send me selfies at least for the next while as i process?\n\nEDIT 1: I have told her that her relationship with him bothers me, she has maintained that he's a very good friend that she doesn't want to lose.", "created_utc": 1697022816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175bia8/aita_for_asking_gf_to_not_send_me_selfies/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your gf is clearly not over her ex so she\u2019s an AH for dating you with that, and you\u2019re an AH for making selfies seem like a relationship marker.", "YTA. If you're uncomfortable with your girlfriend's relationship with her ex, you should communicate that instead of letting resentment build up and then explode over a small issue. She's been open to you about their friendship, happily showed you all the messages when you asked and it doesn't sound like you've communicated anything until now. Instead, you've made assumptions and upset yourself.\n\nI'm not saying your feelings aren't valid, but you could've spoken up a year ago and communicated maturely.", "NTA\n\nThis relationship is probably over. \n\nSo many red flags. she tells her Ex stuff about your relationship, and is in constant contact with him.\n\nI suspect after this you don't trust her.\n\nBest to walk away before this gets messy", "\nGirls only do that with guys they\u2019re into lol, she\u2019s 100% not over him. I\u2019m shocked at anyone saying otherwise, it\u2019s clearly flirting. And she texts him with actual interest compared to the 3-4 word responses she gives you. It\u2019s over.", "NTA,  she's not over her ex. You guys don't have anybties and don't live together. I'd dump her 9f I were you.", "NTA. It\u2019s clear, based on the different types of texts he receives vs your experience that she would leave you for him. Just drop her.", "Soft YTA because you're letting her feed you this nonsense. Nothing wrong with opposite sex friends but this feels like you're the stepping stone until she can get her man back.", "I'd say YTA for how you handled it at the end when she sent you a selfie, it was pretty but you've already acknowledged that in your post.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't be comfortable with my partner staying in contact with an ex, especially so often, it would feel like an emotional affair if they rarely text you but often message the ex. You've put your boundary down, which by your description seemed fair and honest, really all you can do is see if she respects it.\n\nOnce emotions aren't as high I'd recommend sitting down and having an honest conversation with each other, and apologise for making that petty dig.", "ESH.\n\nYou for telling your gf how important selfies are to you and then going off on her when she sends you one. And checking her messages means you still do not trust her.\n\nYour gf because apparently she prioritizes staying in touch with some ex over your peace of mind. Also, she doesn't hate texting, she just hates texting with you.\n\nSo you might wanna do some soul-searching.", "ESH. Move on.", "YTA for dismissing the selfies, the polite thing would just be to ignore it. That said, she's got some issues with Rex and thats understandably putting you on high alert. \n\nAll of that is secondary however. If you really love someone enough to warrant a relationship, a 45 minute commute shouldnt keep you apart. I think you might just  be better off shutting this whole thing down.", "Yta.. sending selfies isn't any kind of cheating unless they are intended that way and if you can't trust her you should reconsider dating until you are healed from the last person who betrayed  you", "ESH \n\nThey're selfies...come on \n\nShes clearly not over him tho so just dump her", "You\u2019re also the AH for excepting that behavior in a partner.", "ESH\n\nMore on her part than yourself but you're both out of line.  Yall have been together for a year and it seems like she's not over her ex 100%..long paragraphs, more conversations about yalls relationship, and all in all, treating him like a BFF. Why did they even break up?...and I read in one of your replies that she would choose him over you? These signs are red flag central if you haven't noticed by now.\n\nAlso, on your part, selifies aren't anything wrong, especially when sending them to friends. But it doesn't even compare to what all she does. She may not be cheating, but she sure is not committed to the relationship yall had for a year.", "You didn\u2019t handle this well, but I would be a bit concerned about her relationship with her ex. She tells you she doesn\u2019t like texting, but will send him long paragraphs. And why is she even sending him selfies? I don\u2019t get why a person would do that. Why did she even break up with him in the first place since they clearly get along very well. You should try and sit down with her and have a calm conversation, not about the selfies, as that\u2019s not your issue, but about the overall situation. Maybe it\u2019s nothing, maybe it\u2019s something, maybe you two have different standards in regard to relationship boundaries. Either way, you need to figure it out.

If you're not ready to trust, to be secure in your relationship etc then don't be in one. Work on yourself and hop back into dating once you've healed.\n\nShe shouldn't have lied to you about how she communicates with Rex. Lies ruin relationships.", "While I think the selfies thing is unreasonable, what stood out to me is that she apparently barely converses with you because she 'hates texting' but writes paragraph after paragraph with someone else.\n\nThat would rub me the wrong way too... Not because I wouldn't want to have long text conversations with only me, but because she only wants to have them with other people...", "Kinda NTA, but run mate, this relationship is not healthy or sustainable at all.", "YTA. If you can't handle dating women who have male friends then don't do it. Get some therapy instead. \n\nI send selfies to all sorts of people.

No one wants to lose a friend - the aka sounds like your wording, and that's unfair to put words in her mouth. It's up to you to trust her. From your post, she hasn't done anything for you to doubt her. These are your insecurities from your previous relationship. You can't help how you feel but you might ruin this and any future relationship this way, and also hurt your partner/s in the process.

Not give her these stupid rules like \"don't send me selfies\".", "Added it to the end.\n\nTrue the aka is me reading into it and that's not fair to her sure. Honestly wouldn't want to ask and that be her answer. \n\nI do attend therapy working through my past relationship and trying to work on my own insecurities yes.", "Oh for sure. I'm on good terms with my exes. If I see them in public I'll smile, say hi, and then move on. I don't have any urge to text them constantly. That's a red flag.", "Yeah, that's fair, it's a difficult convo to have. But I can't imagine it's any easier if you're fighting and feeling upset or betrayed about Selfies.\n\nYou need to have an open and honest discussion with your gf about your relationship and expectations. Be honest but be fair. You should both ask yourselves if you can be happy in a relationship like this, and if you're willing to work together. The answer may be no.", "No, it's not. It's incompatibility bc you don't understand that people can be friends without wanting to have sex. \n\nDump your girlfriend. You have different values and morals when it comes to this. \n\nSadly, you likely won't be a friend after the break up."]}
