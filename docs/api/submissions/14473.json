Losing a child is wrong in the order of things  and a grief you should never have to face. \n\nOf course you're not being selfish - there would be so many triggers to open wounds at such an event. Some may be able to deal with it but so many could not. \n\nIf you could send a note to your niece so she knows you love her and wish her well, that may help the family dynamic.  They likely haven't thought this through. Know that more thoughtful people will understand. \n\nMay your daughter's memory be a blessing.", "NAH. \n\nI don't think most people can grasp the level of grief associated with the loss of a child, and it's unfair of them to try and guilt you about it. \n\nThat being said, I hope you're in grief counseling because you also shouldn't shut yourself off from the rest of your family forever, and part of healing will eventually be seeing them all again. \n\nI'd have a private convo with your niece about the situation, so that she knows it's not personal and how much you love and support her. Don't let anybody else spin the narrative, because messages always get convoluted.", "NTA\n\nA wedding isn't an appropriate place to test whether you are able to handle family gatherings following your daughter's death. If you attended, it would be the first time you'd be seeing everyone since her funeral, in a city that reminds you of her, and I think that's too much too soon. You need to take baby steps to returning to CA and allow yourself space to feel your feelings. Being surrounded by 100+ people at an occasion where everyone is supposed to be happy isn't going to give you that opportunity and you may end up doing yourself more harm.\n\nYour brother and sister in law don't get to dictate what you're comfortable doing. I can understand them being disappointed, but to make you feel selfish for not setting your grief aside for their daughter is completely unreasonable and shows a lack of compassion.", "NTA. Feel free to remind your brother he's not a place to comment based on experience, and you hope he never is.", "Nta\nMy Mother went through the same pain. And in every niece/nephew wedding She went, She was so sad and so hurt because all the family was there but her dead son", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think your brother and SIL appreciate that this isn\u2019t just about holding it together for one day, the experience could trigger a depressive spiral that could take months to resolve.  You\u2019ve struggled to get where you are, and it is a very fresh wound.  \n\nAnd my suspicion is that if you went and couldn\u2019t make it though, and either stayed and cried or had to leave, they would not be happy with that either.", "Not going to give a judgement but please reach out to the bride and tell her you are sorry you aren't ready to be there in person but you can't wait to see videos and pictures and will be thinking of her on her special day.", "NTA - Everyone grieves differently. You know yourself best and no one gets to dictate \"when\" you should be able to 'set aside your feelings.' Sorry for your loss, OP.", "NTA but do yourself a favour and tell your niece that this is not because of her, but you that you would like but  just cannot attend.", "NTA, I can understand why they would be upset, but take the time you need to heal. If you wouldn\u2019t be in a good headspace while there, it might not be that nice for them to celebrate with you anyway. That being said, I would suggest calling your niece personally to talk and finding a way to celebrate with her separately in a way that works for you.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. No you\u2019re absolutely not being selfish. In some cultures (such as my own) close family members have to post pone such ceremonies such as a wedding when a family member/relative passes away. My uncle was going to get married a few months back but unfortunately his cousin passed away she was 18. The wedding has been postponed and will be happening in a year. It\u2019s completely normal to not want to attend a wedding, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Do whatever makes you feel best, if you can\u2019t go to the wedding then don\u2019t. It\u2019s your choice and your choice only. Take care of yourself, sending you much love! \ud83d\udc97", "NTA. Kinda ah of them to call you selfiah. People grieve and cope different. Take your time to heal.", "NTA", "Nta it is awful they made tou feel this way, no one should be telling you what to do with your grief!!!", "NTA.", "NTA, your brother and SIL are fucking monsters.\n\nSend a kind note and best wishes to the bride.", "NTA", "NTA absolutely not! And they are TA for making you feel bad. Honestly I would do you for a little. You had a huge life event just happen and what is everyone going to do when they see you? I'm sorry for your loss, how are you holding up etc. For the whole wedding. As much as people would like to say I am wrong it's the truth. I would send them a card and call it a day.", "NTA\n\nUnless you experience it, most folks, no matter how well meaning they are, can not even begin to understand the myriad of emotions you will always encounter for the rest of your life. I lost 2 children. One 24 yrs ago, and one 12 yrs ago. I still, after all these years, find myself in public with tears in my eyes, or even crying because some small normal thing made my heart break again. I don't and sometimes can't explain to anyone my pitiful state. I just want to be alone. All this to say, we all heal in our own time and in our own way.", "NTA. You are grieving and grief takes many forms. Although their response is semi understandable they should realize how hard this would be on you and respect your decision.", "NTA. This should be a happy day for everyone and I am worried about you going there and trying to be nice while emotionally dying inside. Send a nice present, maybe visit before or after, explain yourself. Maybe until September you will change your mind but if you don't, that's alright as well. Take care. I am very sorry for your terrible loss.", "NTA. You're in a lose-lose situation.  You don't go and your brother & SIL call you a \"selfish asshole\". If you do go, then all these people you haven't seen since your daughter's funeral will be asking you how you're doing and other questions. Your brother and SIL will call you a \"selfish asshole\" for taking away attention from your niece.  \n\nThe less painful option is as you planned and not attending. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH. They may just be worrying about whether you'll ever feel ready to re-join big family events like this though. \n\nSeptember is still a while away, why not leave the option open for now?", "NTA losing a child is a level of grief you cannot comprehend unless you have experienced it. \nMy heart aches for you as this wedding is going to hit you with a whole fresh lot of  'it shoul have been '.\nLet your niece know you love her and wish her every happiness but that attending is just too hard for you right now. \nBe kind to yourself OP and know that in time the memories will make you smile more and hurt less.", "What does your therapist say?", "Don't want to make a judgement because I would want to know what was actually said that made you feel like that (maybe they were assholes, or maybe you feel kind of guilty and are projecting a bit), but I have seen this recently from somewhat the other side.  My cousin died suddenly earlier this year, about a month before my brother's wedding.  We weren't sure if my uncle was going to make it, but we wanted him to.  He ultimately did come, and while there were definitely some very difficult moments for him I don't think he's going to regret being there.  I wouldn't call you an asshole for not going, but that would be the consideration I would make, at whatever point this feels less acute, which choice do you think you will want to have made?", "NTA - you need space to grieve.  No parent should outlive their child.  Send a nice gift.  Your neice has over 100 guests, your absence will be noted and understandable, but not a distraction.  Maybe your brother will miss having you there, but that's his problem.", "NTA. You are grieving. Send a nice letter and a gift. Hopefully your niece is more understanding. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA Your brother and SIL are. If they can't understand or respect your feelings that's on them. The scars for you are still very fresh. You need more time to heal. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.", "NTA but that's bordering on some not so healthy avoidance", "NTA - I'm very sorry for your trouble.  She was too young to die\n\nit would be nice if you could see family but if you would be too upset, then they would then blame you for making a fuss.\n\nWish the bride and goom well and perhaps in the years to come you might reconnect in person", "NTA", "I am sorry for your loss. I hope you find a grieve counselor to help you through this difficult time.", "NAH", "YTA if you ever want to be close to your family again.

The death of a child must be incredibly painful and I think you\u2019re entitled to feel however you feel. But you may be hurting yourself more by not celebrating those that are alive. Grief for the dead and joy for the living can coexist. I wish you the best.", "NTA, in any way. I do hope you reconsider this decision, give it extra thought.

I'm sure she will understand your reasons but she shouldn't hear them from other people", "NTA - I'm very sorry for your loss, it's the worst kind of loss which I know very well.  \n\n\nYou have to do what's right for you. Brother and SIL have no say in how you grieve.", "I'm so sorry for your kids, a loss of a child is so wrong.  You are NTA, you are a grieving mother and your niece's parents should accept that it would be very painful for you to be there, there response should be we understand and we will think of you and  miss you and your daughter on our daughter's wedding day.

My condolences to you on the loss of your daughter xx", "Nta", "NTA-I can\u2019t believe how cold they\u2019re being. I would send your niece and nice card/letter, something heartfelt. How proud you are, how much you love her, etc. then offer to catch up in person at a later date.", "NTA. They clearly don\u2019t understand the grief of losing a child. It\u2019s not something you just \u201cget over because it\u2019s been enough time\u201d there are no rules for grief. After I lost my baby, my sister in law gave birth 3 weeks later. It took me a month to be able to visit and meet my niece. I cried when I held her. It\u2019s a pain that cannot be put into words. Like your soul is being torn with grief. Send a nice gift and a heartfelt note or letter.", "Nta. Contact your niece directly and explain to her. Tell her you\u2019re happy for her but can\u2019t be there for your own reasons.

I cannot imagine the grief you\u2019re going through but I hope you have a support system where you are.   \n\n\nYou are NTA. If you went and got upset or something triggered a memory etc then they\u2019d be calling you out for making it about you & your loss. Either way I feel like it\u2019s a lose/lose situation. But you have to do what\u2019s best for you. Which is staying home. I\u2019d write a note to your niece blessing her marriage and wishes her love. Your brother and SIL need lessons in compassion and empathy.", "NTA. I'm so, SO sorry and I can't even begin to imagine your pain. From one mother to another, big hug for you.", "NTA.  The thing is, there is now escape for you from this grief even on a daily basis.  I have seen it happen with my aunt and uncle when my cousin died, and I honestly wouldn\u2019t wish that sort of grief in my worst enemy.  These things are not supposed to happen - it is not in the natural order of life. I think for anybody to expect you to put your grief on hold is selfish themselves. \n\nI am so sorry for what happened to you, and I hope with time you get to a place where you have more good days than bad. It is very good that you recognised that the circumstances of this wedding will be too much for you, and that not attending is best for you.  In a way, and especially given how your brother and SIL have handled it, it is better for your niece also. Explain to your niece directly and wish her all the best (hopefully she will understand), and then maybe go a bit LC with everybody for a bit - you don\u2019t need any negativity at the moment. \n\nHugs from this internet stranger.", "No, this is neither selfish nor AH behaviour. There is nothing selfish about grief, and grieving the loss of a child is perhaps the worst grief that can be experienced. No one gets to set the timeline for you.\n\n You said yourself - there will be at least 100 people there. You are NTA, without a doubt. Send your niece a nice card and a thoughtful gift and save yourself what pain you can.", "NTA! That\u2019s horrible how they are treating you. Grief is so different for everyone.

A lot of brides would be upset if they aren\u2019t the center of attention on their wedding day.
