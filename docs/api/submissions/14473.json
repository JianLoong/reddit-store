Losing a child is wrong in the order of things  and a grief you should never have to face. \n\nOf course you're not being selfish - there would be so many triggers to open wounds at such an event. Some may be able to deal with it but so many could not. \n\nIf you could send a note to your niece so she knows you love her and wish her well, that may help the family dynamic.  They likely haven't thought this through. Know that more thoughtful people will understand. \n\nMay your daughter's memory be a blessing.", "NAH. \n\nI don't think most people can grasp the level of grief associated with the loss of a child, and it's unfair of them to try and guilt you about it. \n\nThat being said, I hope you're in grief counseling because you also shouldn't shut yourself off from the rest of your family forever, and part of healing will eventually be seeing them all again. \n\nI'd have a private convo with your niece about the situation, so that she knows it's not personal and how much you love and support her. Don't let anybody else spin the narrative, because messages always get convoluted.", "NTA\n\nA wedding isn't an appropriate place to test whether you are able to handle family gatherings following your daughter's death. If you attended, it would be the first time you'd be seeing everyone since her funeral, in a city that reminds you of her, and I think that's too much too soon. You need to take baby steps to returning to CA and allow yourself space to feel your feelings. Being surrounded by 100+ people at an occasion where everyone is supposed to be happy isn't going to give you that opportunity and you may end up doing yourself more harm.\n\nYour brother and sister in law don't get to dictate what you're comfortable doing. I can understand them being disappointed, but to make you feel selfish for not setting your grief aside for their daughter is completely unreasonable and shows a lack of compassion.", "NTA. Feel free to remind your brother he's not a place to comment based on experience, and you hope he never is.", "Nta\nMy Mother went through the same pain.

I don\u2019t think your brother and SIL appreciate that this isn\u2019t just about holding it together for one day, the experience could trigger a depressive spiral that could take months to resolve.  You\u2019ve struggled to get where you are, and it is a very fresh wound.  \n\nAnd my suspicion is that if you went and couldn\u2019t make it though, and either stayed and cried or had to leave, they would not be happy with that either.", "Not going to give a judgement but please reach out to the bride and tell her you are sorry you aren't ready to be there in person but you can't wait to see videos and pictures and will be thinking of her on her special day.", "NTA - Everyone grieves differently.

No you\u2019re absolutely not being selfish. In some cultures (such as my own) close family members have to post pone such ceremonies such as a wedding when a family member/relative passes away.

This should be a happy day for everyone and I am worried about you going there and trying to be nice while emotionally dying inside.

I am very sorry for your terrible loss.", "NTA. You're in a lose-lose situation.  You don't go and your brother & SIL call you a \"selfish asshole\". If you do go, then all these people you haven't seen since your daughter's funeral will be asking you how you're doing and other questions. Your brother and SIL will call you a \"selfish asshole\" for taking away attention from your niece.  \n\nThe less painful option is as you planned and not attending. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH.

My cousin died suddenly earlier this year, about a month before my brother's wedding.  We weren't sure if my uncle was going to make it, but we wanted him to.  He ultimately did come, and while there were definitely some very difficult moments for him I don't think he's going to regret being there.  I wouldn't call you an asshole for not going, but that would be the consideration I would make, at whatever point this feels less acute, which choice do you think you will want to have made?", "NTA - you need space to grieve.  No parent should outlive their child.  Send a nice gift.  Your neice has over 100 guests, your absence will be noted and understandable, but not a distraction.

I have seen it happen with my aunt and uncle when my cousin died, and I honestly wouldn\u2019t wish that sort of grief in my worst enemy.  These things are not supposed to happen - it is not in the natural order of life.

At first, you can\u2019t even breathe or come up for air because of how hard and quickly they\u2019re dashing down on you. Eventually, and this is the stage I\u2019m am at, the waves become predictable and you can usually see them coming. You\u2019re at a baby shower or your friend announces an accomplishment of some kind on Facebook. A holiday (my most difficult one is Christmas) or a birthday.

I did it when my dad died when I was 18 and it took me 20 years to break free of the grief/self sorrow.  It turned out I wasn't just grieving, I was making grieving my whole world.

Sadly, the people who haven't been inside the storm just do not get it-- and sometimes it's shocking to find out who isn't \"inside the storm\" with you.\n\n(Copying from another comment I made)\n\nIn 2020, my brother- and sister-in-law died in a car accident. They were 21. It was and continues to be absolutely devastating. \n\nLast October (2022), my other brother-in-law finally married his fiancee. They'd been engaged since well before the accident. And let me tell you: it was *hard*. We were *so* happy for them. We love his wife *so* much. But I know at the very least, the remainder of our nuclear family-- my husband, my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, and myself-- spent the whole day choking back (or failing to choke back) tears, knowing that our siblings/children should have been there. They should've been in the bridal party. They should've been their loud and obnoxious selves. I burst out in tears during the ceremony, and it looked like I was being sentimental, but only my husband-- who was the best man-- knew the real source of those particular tears. I felt so guilty. Like the worst sister in the world. But the pain was just so real and visceral, and there was nothing I could do to stop thinking about all that we lost. My father in law, who is normally the life of the party, stayed sober and solemn. The four of us stayed at the table with our two empty seats for my late BIL and SIL. We couldn't, and wouldn't, ask my other BIL & SIL to wait any longer, but that doesn't mean we were ready to celebrate *anything* yet.\n\nStay home. Send your niece and her new spouse a lovely card.

I have never had kids (and never plan to either), but having lost pets (which are not even *anywhere close or comparable* to losing children ofc) even I was able to empathize that anything close to a year would still be emotionally pretty recent and raw for OP.
