Losing a child is wrong in the order of things  and a grief you should never have to face. \n\nOf course you're not being selfish - there would be so many triggers to open wounds at such an event. Some may be able to deal with it but so many could not. \n\nIf you could send a note to your niece so she knows you love her and wish her well, that may help the family dynamic.  They likely haven't thought this through. Know that more thoughtful people will understand. \n\nMay your daughter's memory be a blessing.", "NAH. \n\nI don't think most people can grasp the level of grief associated with the loss of a child, and it's unfair of them to try and guilt you about it. \n\nThat being said, I hope you're in grief counseling because you also shouldn't shut yourself off from the rest of your family forever, and part of healing will eventually be seeing them all again. \n\nI'd have a private convo with your niece about the situation, so that she knows it's not personal and how much you love and support her. Don't let anybody else spin the narrative, because messages always get convoluted.", "NTA\n\nA wedding isn't an appropriate place to test whether you are able to handle family gatherings following your daughter's death. If you attended, it would be the first time you'd be seeing everyone since her funeral, in a city that reminds you of her, and I think that's too much too soon. You need to take baby steps to returning to CA and allow yourself space to feel your feelings. Being surrounded by 100+ people at an occasion where everyone is supposed to be happy isn't going to give you that opportunity and you may end up doing yourself more harm.\n\nYour brother and sister in law don't get to dictate what you're comfortable doing. I can understand them being disappointed, but to make you feel selfish for not setting your grief aside for their daughter is completely unreasonable and shows a lack of compassion.", "NTA. Feel free to remind your brother he's not a place to comment based on experience, and you hope he never is.", "Nta\nMy Mother went through the same pain.

I don\u2019t think your brother and SIL appreciate that this isn\u2019t just about holding it together for one day, the experience could trigger a depressive spiral that could take months to resolve.  You\u2019ve struggled to get where you are, and it is a very fresh wound.  \n\nAnd my suspicion is that if you went and couldn\u2019t make it though, and either stayed and cried or had to leave, they would not be happy with that either.", "Not going to give a judgement but please reach out to the bride and tell her you are sorry you aren't ready to be there in person but you can't wait to see videos and pictures and will be thinking of her on her special day.", "NTA - Everyone grieves differently.

No you\u2019re absolutely not being selfish. In some cultures (such as my own) close family members have to post pone such ceremonies such as a wedding when a family member/relative passes away.

This should be a happy day for everyone and I am worried about you going there and trying to be nice while emotionally dying inside.

I am very sorry for your terrible loss.", "NTA. You're in a lose-lose situation.  You don't go and your brother & SIL call you a \"selfish asshole\". If you do go, then all these people you haven't seen since your daughter's funeral will be asking you how you're doing and other questions. Your brother and SIL will call you a \"selfish asshole\" for taking away attention from your niece.  \n\nThe less painful option is as you planned and not attending. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH.

My cousin died suddenly earlier this year, about a month before my brother's wedding.  We weren't sure if my uncle was going to make it, but we wanted him to.  He ultimately did come, and while there were definitely some very difficult moments for him I don't think he's going to regret being there.  I wouldn't call you an asshole for not going, but that would be the consideration I would make, at whatever point this feels less acute, which choice do you think you will want to have made?", "NTA - you need space to grieve.  No parent should outlive their child.  Send a nice gift.  Your neice has over 100 guests, your absence will be noted and understandable, but not a distraction.

I have seen it happen with my aunt and uncle when my cousin died, and I honestly wouldn\u2019t wish that sort of grief in my worst enemy.  These things are not supposed to happen - it is not in the natural order of life. I think for anybody to expect you to put your grief on hold is selfish themselves. \n\nI am so sorry for what happened to you, and I hope with time you get to a place where you have more good days than bad. It is very good that you recognised that the circumstances of this wedding will be too much for you, and that not attending is best for you.

At first, you can\u2019t even breathe or come up for air because of how hard and quickly they\u2019re dashing down on you. Eventually, and this is the stage I\u2019m am at, the waves become predictable and you can usually see them coming. You\u2019re at a baby shower or your friend announces an accomplishment of some kind on Facebook. A holiday (my most difficult one is Christmas) or a birthday.

They were 21. It was and continues to be absolutely devastating. \n\nLast October (2022), my other brother-in-law finally married his fiancee. They'd been engaged since well before the accident. And let me tell you: it was *hard*. We were *so* happy for them. We love his wife *so* much. But I know at the very least, the remainder of our nuclear family-- my husband, my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, and myself-- spent the whole day choking back (or failing to choke back) tears, knowing that our siblings/children should have been there. They should've been in the bridal party. They should've been their loud and obnoxious selves. I burst out in tears during the ceremony, and it looked like I was being sentimental, but only my husband-- who was the best man-- knew the real source of those particular tears. I felt so guilty. Like the worst sister in the world. But the pain was just so real and visceral, and there was nothing I could do to stop thinking about all that we lost. My father in law, who is normally the life of the party, stayed sober and solemn. The four of us stayed at the table with our two empty seats for my late BIL and SIL. We couldn't, and wouldn't, ask my other BIL & SIL to wait any longer, but that doesn't mean we were ready to celebrate *anything* yet.\n\nStay home. Send your niece and her new spouse a lovely card.

I have never had kids (and never plan to either), but having lost pets (which are not even *anywhere close or comparable* to losing children ofc) even I was able to empathize that anything close to a year would still be emotionally pretty recent and raw for OP.

For them to not be able to put themselves in OP's shoes and guilt her instead reveals a staggering lack of basic humanity and is AH behavior in my books.\n\nEdit: wow, reading the comments- and like... marriage and the \"perfect wedding\" industry seems to actually rot some people's brains? Honestly mind boggled by the folks saying OP's relationship with their niece may be \"understandably altered forever\" if OP chooses to quietly opt out of an event due to the death of their adult daughter *just one fucking year ago*. Are there actually places where empathy and humanity are at such a deficit? \n\nI have had my fair share of major life events I would have loved to celebrate with my loved ones, but I am also aware that I am NOT \"the most important and only person for whom all the world and time needs to stop\", even if for a day. I don't know if some people either haven't faced any loss themselves (which, good for them, I sincerely hope the world does not burst their naive bubble), or simply were never told that the sun doesn't shine out of their ass as kids. I would go so far as to say that *anyone* who holds their loved one simply opting out of their joyous event because of emotional distress and trauma (like the death of a child) is an Asshole and should seek help to learn how to develop and function with basic human empathy.

I can only imagine how it feels as a mother to know that you won't see your daughter's moments.  Interestingly enough something similar happened in my family.

They both gave birth on the same day but her baby didn't survive the birth.   As I was growing up every sooften she would bump into my mom when I was with her and ask if I was the baby and what was I doing now.  She saw me as I grew up hitting milestones her daughter never got to make.  So she experienced this loss of her daughter's  future  for years whenever she saw me.

I do think that you should maybe reconsider going though. This is a huge loss that you\u2019re grieving and obviously going will be very difficult, but - not to be morbid - it might be a good thing to celebrate something positive with your family and friends because it would be awful to not go back until you\u2019re gathered for another sad event. Not to mention these are memories you never forget, it seems you have a good relationship with your niece seeing as they grew up super close. You might even be reminded of/feel your daughter in some way as I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve been a bridesmaid. That said if you do go, make sure that you\u2019re able to be happy for the marriage at hand, and if it gets too much it would probably be best to leave as you don\u2019t want to draw attention from the happy occasion. Personally I\u2019d rather try my best than miss it all and regret it\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, whatever you decide is 100% valid and nobody should make you feel selfish for doing what\u2019s best for you", "Hey mama. I'm a nurse in a pediatric intensive care unit. I deal with parents who have lost or are in the process of losing children often. I've seen grieving parents do some absolutely wild things, but this is not one of them. You are completely in your rights to decline going to the wedding. There are so many other ways for you to show your niece that you care for her and support her without having to sacrifice your emotional well-being. \n\nThis isn't nearly on the same level as what you're going through, but I haven't been to a single one of my cousins baby showers. I desperately want to find a husband and have a family, and I know that going to a celebration of theirs will only upset me, especially since they all married their high school/college sweethearts and seemed to effortlessly achieve a goal that I've been struggling with for years. Being a nurse has taught me that you can not take care of others if you can't even take care of yourself. And additionally, I'm pretty much 100% sure my cousins would rather me not show up than to come and risk having a crying breakdown on a day thats supposed to be about happiness for them, not sadness for me. No one needs me to emotionally shart all over their big day. \n\nOnly you can decide what's right for you right now. No one else. Do not feel bad about setting boundaries and prioritizing yourself right now. Given time, I think your niece will understand, especially if/when she has children of her own. Someone who hasn't been through the loss of a child cannot fathom what it is like, which is all the more reason for your family to take what you say at face value, trust and believe you, and meet you where you are with love and understanding.", "Eh. it\u2019s been a year, you can make a family outing for your nieces special day.", "NTA. You can't put your feelings aside like it's a fashion accessory. I would certainly encourage you to find a way to move on (which is entirely different to forgettting) but if you're not ready and this is too painful then it's entirely reasonable not to attend. I would contact your niece and explain to her. Hopefully she's more understanding. But you can also pass on your wishes. And maybe some other time, some other event, you'll be ready.", "NTA.

I'm also not saying it's been enough time, because god knows, no time will ever be enough to move forward from the death of a child. \n\nI'm gently calling you an AH because you might be being one to yourself without even realising. We lost my dad a couple years ago, and my mom shut herself off after that. She cut off her family, moved away, kept isolating - worsening her already existing depression.

Would anything stop you?\n\nYou're not being selfish, but by isolating yourself, you're not helping you grieve either. Grief is tough, not having to face the memories is easier.

Or did you just tell your brother and SIL and expect them to tell your niece for you? If that's the case, then YTA for putting this responsibility on your brother & SIL. You are allowed to grieve how  you feel \"best\" with, but it's also your responsibility to tell people yourself what's going on. \n\nI think your brother, SIL& Niece, are allowed to feel sad or even disappointed or mad. Your feelings are valid, but so are theirs. BUT you are not selfish or a bad person for grieving, and they had no right to call you out like this. Grieving takes time. Some grieve right away and crash hard. Others act like nothing happens because they block out their feelings because it's too painful. There are so many ways to grieve, like people living on this planet.", "Very very sorry for your loss n NTA", "I agree with your point but the girls were 7 months apart in age, it's been 14 months since OP's daughter passed."]}
