I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole for having emotions related to it, but chances are she already feels some sort of shame or upset about it and telling her she is unattractive because of it is an AH thing to do. You could offer support in the way of talking about options to get her therapy, and possibly talking about a plan to keep the wounds clean and covered. There are many ways to cover wounds that aren\u2019t regular bandaids, you could even use a bit of gauze and a tegadern patch.", "I\u2019m pretty sure she might have dermatillomania. If i were you i\u2019d sit her down and tell her you\u2019re concerned about her health and that you\u2019ve been wondering how to help her, that\u2019s how you stumbled upon this disorder etc. That way you aren\u2019t telling her straight out that her compulsion is making you think she\u2019s unattractive or undesirable. \n\nShe needs help, she won\u2019t stop no matter how hard she tries. It\u2019s a compulsion and she needs professional help dealing with it (if she has dermatillomania that is, but it\u2019s very likely she does). \n\nYour feelings are valid, but you should approach this conversation with her and her health in mind not that you\u2019re losing attraction for her. \n\nBest of luck to you and i hope she gets the help she needs.", "Really depends HOW you address it.  This could swing wildly one way or the other with the words you use.  Picking like this is usually a mental issue that needs addressing with a proffessional.", "I hope she\u2019s in therapy for this; it\u2019s a compulsive behavior that won\u2019t get better without treatment.

It\u2019s completely understandable that you would be turned off by that. I would look for some mental health professional advice. Is she in therapy or treatment of any kind? Addiction of any kind has a way of negatively impacting our relationships. If she\u2019s not working proactively to manage this then it\u2019s likely to get far far worse over time. She\u2019s young, given 10 years untreated\u2014it could get way worse.

You need to approach it in a way that\u2019s different than simple attractiveness. Just like losing should be a health concern and not just about looks", "NTA. \n\nI think you should first mention your concern but don\u2019t shy away from bringing up attraction. However, mention this in a heartfelt manner and with respect. She may think differently if she realises it\u2019s affecting your attraction to her\u2026 in the same way that a partner telling me my nail biting habit is off putting.", "Sounds like severe excoriation disorder and will definitely need professional help with a therapist that specializes in OCD/dermatillomania (another name for excoriation disorder) \n\nSpeaking from experience I highly doubt it\u2019s going to go away without years of work and probably medication. \n\nYou WBTA if you brought up this conversation I\u2019m relation to how attracted you are to her; this is a mental health issue and she really needs help.", "NTA. I do this too and trust me, it's frustrating that I can't stop doing it even if I want to. I was talking to someone some time ago and she had asked about my scabs. She had mentioned she had a customer who had the same thing and at some point in time a doctor (I can't remember if she asked her Dr or if the customer said her Dr said) that it's common with people who have suffered a traumatic childhood/ childhood abuse. It made so much more sense why I do it now. Is your gf going to therapy? It's possible that she has some sort of issue steaming from her childhood that may need some addressing. It's also a form of self harm, so I would be more worried about what's going on with her mental health. I noticed that my periods of letting them heal and stop picking them are when I'm actually feeling good mentally with no stress or anything. It starts again if something really bad happens and I often do it without thinking and by the time I realize what I'm doing, it's too late and it's been picked. \n\nSit and talk to her, but maybe don't bring up the fact that you're not attracted to her much anymore yet. Let her know you're concerned about her and see 8f she's willing to work with your full support and seek help to stop. If she isn't, it might be time to break up for you since it's a deal breaker and you know she won't stop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
