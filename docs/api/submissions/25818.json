We spoke gibberish that sounded a bit like French.  After awhile our Spanish speaking friends complained we were rude! Then they finally realized how rude they were being and it stopped. Next time say something in a language that they dont understand before you walk away. Even if you have to make it up as you speak. Laugh while you look at them speaking the unknown language.

You got into a relationship with a bilingual person. This is what it\u2019s like. \n\nLet me give an example. My parents own a business together. Whenever they talk about work, even at home, it\u2019s 90+% in English. But if they are ever discussing personal stuff or if the conversation gets heated, they overwhelmingly use Farsi. They use the language that feels most comfortable in the context with which they\u2019re accustomed to that language. It changes based on the subject, even though both are fully fluent in both languages. \n\nThis is life with a bilingual person. You knew going into this  relationship that your partner is bilingual. Are they and their family forever forbidden from using one of their native languages simply because you are ignorant of it? How is that fair to them, that they can only use this language when you are not present? \n\nAnother example from my own experience of being around a language I\u2019m not fluent in. I lived in Puerto Rico for some time. I am not fluent in Spanish but I was learning while I was there. People who were fluent in English constantly spoke Spanish around me and it wasn\u2019t at all personal, it\u2019s just what made them comfortable. It\u2019s their native tongue. \n\nI would never dream of demanding that they speak only English in my presence. That is woefully unfair. And honestly one of the ways I learned the language more was just by sitting and listening and trying to figure out what they are saying.\n\nNow if they are only using the native language to talk about you or purposely keep you out, then yes that is an asshole move.

That until you learn the language, there will be some conversations you get left out of. It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s just reality. \n\nYou can either learn to be comfortable with them speaking another language until you learn the language yourself or exit the relationship.

There are a lot of patient and empathetic comments trying to explain to you just that.

So when I go to my family gatherings even tho they also were born in the United States they grew up speaking English and Spanish and are fluent in both, i miss out on many conversations bc **i do not speak Spanish** I\u2019ve tried to learn over the years but to no avail. Sometimes I\u2019ll ask my mom what\u2019s being said bc she also doesn\u2019t speak Spanish but she grew up with them so she understands it. She\u2019ll explain it to me and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not rude and those are my literal family members \u201cexcluding\u201d me but it really has nothing to do with me. And I can recognize that. Why can\u2019t you?", "You feel excluded because you were unable to join in on a family argument about politics??? Why would you even want to do that?? It never ends well, and these are your inlaws no less. I\u2019d keep my mouth firmly shut even if they were speaking my language.", "You're not understanding me. I am saying that people who get uncomfortable when people speak a language they don't speak are racist.", "OP, as someone born and completely raised in the US, there are still some conversations that feel better and more comfortable in my mother tongue than English, even though my fluency in English is far superior. There are just some topics, subjects, and moments that feel more appropriate in my native ethnic language than English, even though I am totally American. I suspect this is similar for your partner and their family. \n\nI suggest you do some research into studies on bilingual and multilingual households, communities, and countries. I think you are taking something that has nothing to do with you and taking it personally. If you understand in a mostly monolingual environment, I can understand how this is all new for you, but this phenomenon you are describing is incredibly commonplace and the norm for those of us who grew up in bilingual households. That's why I think if you read up on it, this will carry less charge and be less upsetting for you.\n\nWhy is their accommodating you 95% of the time **- in your own words -** not enough for you? If you stay with your partner long-term, does this mean that you expect them to never speak their other language when you are around? *How is that fair to their family?*", "Your 'note' is entirely irrelevant. Foreign is used to describe the person, or characteristics of that person, and speaking a language other than English in a predominantly English speaking country...

Like seriously what do you expect him to do? just sit there getting worn down by the heightened emotions of the people around him while being unable to even understand what\u2019s going on? Nah it\u2019s healthier and safer for him to find a place away from all the incomprehensible negativity that\u2019s being released in a language he doesn\u2019t understand", "Well supposedly he\u2019s trying to learn the language. Why not use the listening practice", "What? Lol. How is he supposed to be involved when they purposely exclude him? If they want to speak another language that's fine, but what kind of asshole expects someone to sit silently and listen to a group of grown adults argue in another language?

This mean both are native to them.", "So you understand it\u2019s difficult for OP to choose what language they speak in, but not for the family?

That's what brought me from NAH to YTA. Idk if I'm able to express myself correctly, but to me it felt like OP left NOT bc he felt like \"hm, this convo ain't abt me, might as look at the aquarium then\" (bc then I think that would be perfectly fine), but instead \"i told y'all to argue in English! so I'm leaving\" which, after the initial request, just comes off as passive aggressive.

What else are they supposed to do? Just eat in silence? It\u2019s supposed to be a family dinner, and currently, op isn\u2019t feeling a part of it.", "I don't believe it to be irrelevant. They would absolutely take offense to being described or categorized as a \"group of foreigners\"", "First, if we are talking about manners and respect, it is generally considered bad manners and disrespectful to speak in a language an invited guest can't speak during the guests stay. How you live and how you live around others are usually two distinct things. We do many things alone or with certain people we would not do around others. The family is deliberately excluding the OP from a conversation despite the fact OP is an invited guest, this is your definition of a respectful, well mannered action?\n\nOP stated they are learning the language. But, as anyone who has learned a second language knows, this is a long process and they will likely need significant time before they are at a level to understand, let alone contribute, to this type of conversation.\n\nIf it's not that serious, why is it so vital in your mind that he sit silently while people talk around him in a way that deliberately excludes him from the conversation?\n\nAnd for the record, calmly walking away from people speaking what is essentially gibberish to you is none of the nasty terms you use. OP has maturely decided to leave a conversation the family has prevented the OP from contributing to, secure in the knowledge staying is not something the OP wishes to do. This is in no way seeking attention.", "How about you try and learn their language instead OP? Since they're already speaking your language 95% of the time and you're still so bothered then maybe you should help yourself with the remaining 5%? The audacity.", "I learnt English practically from birth as well. Doesn't mean it's my native language or the one I'll default to", "Redditor American in support! Though I'm a bilingual child of immigrants so I probably don't count...", "Exactly. They state in their post that they feel like the family is doing this on purpose to exclude them and it\u2019s just \u2026 not that personal. \n\nOp comes off as someone who\u2019s has lived largely in monolithic and monolingual culture. And for me, as someone where bilingual and biculturalism is what I was raised in, it just comes off as self-centered and frankly silly. \n\nAnd the fact that myself as well as others in this comment section have offered our own experiences growing up bilingual like the partner\u2019s family yet it doesn\u2019t seem like OP is hearing or registering any of it, leads me to believe that they are the asshole in this situation.", "But aren\u2019t they asking them to stop? The whole crux of OPs anger is that they asked them to speak only English, which they overwhelmingly do - **95% of the time** according to OP - but there are moments when they don\u2019t and that is still upsetting to OP. \n\nThe fact their partner is upset about it is what leads me to believe it comes off as passive aggressive rather than non-confrontational. I could be wrong, but that\u2019s how it reads to me.", "I find that very strange for anyone to get offended at that.. It sounds like you and your partners family have some very strange cultural hangups that are contributing to this issue.", "\u2026 nasty terms? LOL oh boy\n\nYour use of the word deliberate is abusive. You\u2019re taking it just as personally as OP which is so silly and petty.\n\nPartners parents are 1) older and 2) prefer to speak in another language from time to time.

Let me guess, you only speak English right?", "I personally would find it stressful to have people I know arguing with each other next to me in a language I didn\u2019t understand. Doing it repeatedly is rude. OP is dealing with that by walking away\u2026 and looking at any nearby aquarium sounds much less unpleasant than watching an argument, now you mention it.", "Do you argue in front of him and force him to watch?", "Yeah, I get that a lot of people think it's entitled that only English be spoken around people who refuse to learn any other language. Maybe the downvotes are people thinking I agree with that attitude.\n\nWhat I meant was that it didn't seem to have a passive component, since he's literally standing and actively walking away.\n\nI agree that he should talk to his partner about why his actions are upsetting to her and her family and take that into account.", "Holy shit. Yea, \"hang ups\" such as not wanting racists to call them *foreign* to a country they were *born in* just because they are multicultural.", "How is my use of the word deliberate abusive? Deliberate means an intentional act. Do you think they are accidentally speaking a language they know the OP doesn't speak?\n\nIf the partners parents speaking in another language is a \"big whoop\" to you, why are you acting like it is some kind of personal insult for OP to get up and leave when they do? Because OP is honor bound to sit silently while people deliberately act in a way that excludes OP from the conversation?\n\nPeople from non-English speaking cultures are (this may be shocking to you).... different. :)\n\nPretending the non--English speaking world is some sort of homogeneous entity where everyone agrees on everything is laughable\n\nAnd for the record I speak multiple languages.

It is rude, disrespectful and a deliberate way of making people feel unwelcome.", "How interesting is it that we can read the same text and have such varied interpretations of it? Humans are so fucking cool. Complicated, but cool. \n\nIf the situation is as you describe it, then yeah I can see why OP is not the a-hole. And you\u2019re right, they need to have more direct communication with their partner about why this is problematic to them. \n\nBut also, as someone who moved to another place where I didn\u2019t really speak and was learning the language, the best way to learn it is to hear people speaking it. I listened to hundreds of conversations in Spanish I didn\u2019t understand but tried to. And over time my comprehension got better and better. \n\nI\u2019m still nowhere near fluent, but I can get by and the majority of that was just listening and practicing. So if OP truly wants to learn the language like they say they do, then they are honestly removing themselves from the best way to learn it.", "And the people that aren't racist/jerks but use the term foreign? Where do they sit?", "Use the term foreign to describe someone who was born in the country in question?\n\n(Ps. Sorry about the weird editing back and forth :S)", "I mean OP explicitly says they speak two, that\u2019s what bilingual means, otherwise it\u2019s trilingual (ect) or a polyglot", "No, people that use the term as per it's actual definition.\n\n\"of, from, in, or characteristic of a country or language other than one's own.\"\n\nSo, if English is the predominant language of a country, and you're speaking another language, that, per the definition, can be described as foreign, without any racist or shitty connotations.", "I reread it and it made more sense being two. The second sentence was just worded weirdly to me."]}
