We spoke gibberish that sounded a bit like French.  After awhile our Spanish speaking friends complained we were rude! Then they finally realized how rude they were being and it stopped. Next time say something in a language that they dont understand before you walk away. Even if you have to make it up as you speak. Laugh while you look at them speaking the unknown language.

You got into a relationship with a bilingual person. This is what it\u2019s like. \n\nLet me give an example. My parents own a business together. Whenever they talk about work, even at home, it\u2019s 90+% in English. But if they are ever discussing personal stuff or if the conversation gets heated, they overwhelmingly use Farsi. They use the language that feels most comfortable in the context with which they\u2019re accustomed to that language. It changes based on the subject, even though both are fully fluent in both languages. \n\nThis is life with a bilingual person. You knew going into this  relationship that your partner is bilingual. Are they and their family forever forbidden from using one of their native languages simply because you are ignorant of it? How is that fair to them, that they can only use this language when you are not present? \n\nAnother example from my own experience of being around a language I\u2019m not fluent in. I lived in Puerto Rico for some time. I am not fluent in Spanish but I was learning while I was there. People who were fluent in English constantly spoke Spanish around me and it wasn\u2019t at all personal, it\u2019s just what made them comfortable. It\u2019s their native tongue. \n\nI would never dream of demanding that they speak only English in my presence. That is woefully unfair. And honestly one of the ways I learned the language more was just by sitting and listening and trying to figure out what they are saying.\n\nNow if they are only using the native language to talk about you or purposely keep you out, then yes that is an asshole move.

That until you learn the language, there will be some conversations you get left out of. It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s just reality. \n\nYou can either learn to be comfortable with them speaking another language until you learn the language yourself or exit the relationship.

OP needs to chill and not worry about this very minor thing", "That changes everything in my opinion! You should put the example in your post. I've traveled a lot when I was younger and we lived with a family from the UK. They would switch language during debates at the table and it was insufferable because we are all sitting having a nice convo and then the two of us are completely excluded from it until they are done. \nBut we were part of the convo before it would get either heated or if the excitement took over. It gets old really fast.", "As a bilingual person myself, I think it\u2019s quite rude to expect people to speak in another language when they\u2019re enthusiastically engaging in a debate in the language they\u2019re most comfortable with, just because you do not understand that language. YTA.", "I get being frustrated but I think you are taking this weirdly personally.", "He literally says he just gets up and walks away, which is rude af, and is completely different from excusing himself. OP's the asshole.", "From the sounds of it only OP\u2019s partner thinks he is an asshole. The family themselves might not care about him walking away.", "Perfectly put", "They aren\u2019t switching for the whole time, just a conversation they wanna keep private and not let them hear if it is vulgar. They can\u2019t sit for 2-5 mins to chill or talk to their partner?", "I'm sorry but it's really rude to just get up and walk away to make a point. Presumably OP is going nowhere special. If OP had to go to the toilet it's fine, but just walking put because you're pissy you can't follow the convo for 5 minutes (when it's an argument you probs have nothing to contribute to anyways) is childish and rude. OP is YTA.", "OP is leaving to make a point and show how he disagrees about their \"mistreatment\" of him. He's being passive aggressive here and that's probably why he's called out by his wife. Given how this post is written, I strongly suppose that he's making a scene of leaving, else nobody would care (likely they'd just assume he'd go to the toilet).\n\nYou can't say you're trying to learn a language and refuse to listen to it when presented with the chance. \n\nYTA", "He's not excusing himself, from how it's told he's \"punishing\" them for not listening to his order to not speak another language.", "I guess many people here were raised feral. Unfortunately my husband also doesn't understand the concept of a family meal, he gets up as soon as he's done vs in my family we eat with each other and chat. It's like an event on its own besides the good food.", "I figured it would be unpopular, but thought it was important to lend a different perspective.\n\nI can sympathize though, I\u2019ve been in a similar position as OP, and it can feel somewhat isolating when you\u2019re excluded from the conversation. FIL spoke Portuguese most of the time when I was around (which I don\u2019t speak). English when speaking directly to me, but conversations went on around me in Portuguese. He was not fluent in English though. With time I got used to it, and could parse the gist of it, maybe 60-70% of what was being said.", "More like xenophobia, no?\n\nBut I'm not so sure it's always that (sometimes yes). I just feel it's from self-centered, egoistical, small-minded people.", "How do you relax listening to an angry discussion without knowing what is said? That's so uncomfortable and depending on the topic and involvement even nerve wracking.", "Agree! Why do so many people seem hell-bent on creating drama at all times. If the argument doesn't involve OP, I don't see the need to create more drama by walking away. Unless the argument lasts 30 mins or something. Just chill.", "With how this whole post was written (as if he was slighted by his in-laws), that was my understanding of the situation too.", "I should think the argument is *about* OP which is why they're switching languages in the first place.  OP leaving just gives the partner's family more fuel for their drama.", "Nah, he likely won't learn much if it's a heated argument. They will speak very quickly and use random vocab that he won't pick up if he is a beginner. Besides, it weird standing around observing people argue that you don't have a clue about.", "Cause its useless if you only got basic stuff.", "And what if there are children? Should they never be exposed to the other language just because OP doesn't speak it?", "Is he not able to start a different conversation with someone else at the table?

You\u2019re at the table in a group of 4-8 people, two people start a brief conversation about something that only they care about. You have nothing to say so you just stay out of the conversation. Normal reaction.\n\nNow imagine every time your friends brought up Warhammer and you don\u2019t play you just got up and walked away. \n\nIt\u2019s weird. It\u2019s rude. Unless these are knock out arguments where you would walk away regardless of the language, it\u2019s just really strange behavior.", "Not everything is about OP. I assume they're not talking between themselves for 20 mins, a few minutes is not something to get upset over.\n\nI had to sit through a lot of bigger family meals and I was required to sit through the courses no matter who was talking about what. Most of the conversation was not about me. That's just how it is with meals in my culture for example. Someone starts speaking about a topic, people join in, if there's enough people more groups form to talk, but it's never artificial and it's not about \"being included\" it's about what's organically being discussed and I guess if you're quiet they'll ask you something but if you don't seem like you want to talk they're not going to insist and just talk about some other topic that will engage someone.\n\nIf you marry someone with a different native language and are around their family who speak that language, you should expect to hear that language, too.", "They should spend their energy learning a new language instead of fuming over it lol", "Yes. In my family we're not even so accommodating (we all know at least basic English, but most don't know more than just that). When we're switching to French in front of family who doesn't speak it, it's not to exclude them, just to be confortable and exact in what we're saying and understanding. If it's a touchy subject, it's sometimes necessary, like for being diplomatic.\n\nOn another side, when I'm in my SO's family, I'm the one not understanding when they speak their language. So what? I can either learn it, speak to someone else available, or just wait while eating/drinking/daydreaming. \n\nI one of the other situation, if the \"excluded\" person wants to be part of it, all it takes is asking \"sorry, what's going on?\" or \"what are you talking about?\".", "The first time I did an overnight holiday with my in-laws, they wanted to play Pictionary.

Just sit back and observe once before deciding to play\u201d. \n\nHoly shit. \n\nWithin 10 minutes it went into a very heated yelling match in their native language that I can decently understand, but only speak\u2026very, very slowly. \n\nAccusations of cheating were made. Chests were bumped. Insults were thrown. \n\nI knew my husband was competitive, but his family are a whole different level. \n\nIt\u2019s suuuper overwhelming to be a bystander in the middle of an argument you don\u2019t fully get. Even if it has nothing to do with you. And you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s friendly, necessarily. \n\nI\u2019m good at Pictionary, but would have had an anxiety attack if my successful guess would have resulted in trying to translate \u201cplayful hooliganism fight\u201d when I didn\u2019t get that it was mostly in jest. \n\nSo ten years later, even though we\u2019re both pretty fluent now, me and BIL walk the new, first time partners out of the room when Pictionary happens, and take shots of alcohol and giggle at the insane team warfare mentality this family loves. \n\nAnd translate for the new folks. \u201cJessi just called Anthony a cheater because he made eye contact with Mike before guessing\u201d. \u201cAnthony just said Jessi failed a geography test in 4th grade, so there\u2019s no fucking way she knows how to draw the state of Delaware\u201d.", "Ummm...seems like you're projecting your own stuff here. OP said nothing about the family arguing about the couple, their race or relationship. If that happened to you, I'm sorry you were treated like that but there is no indication that this is what is happening in this situation. \n\nI think OP is NTA in this situation as long as when they walk away it's not done in a dramatic or angry way.", "Poor little guy, I am going to walk and find a restaurant now to look at the fish in his honor </3", "Depends on how he walked away I suppose - did he just get up and leave or did he make a show of it?

So yes, it's weird when they are speaking amongst themselves and I don't understand anything. \n\nAnd sure, without trying, you won't ever pick up the language while just listening.\n\nBut I now understand (more or less) what they're talking about.
