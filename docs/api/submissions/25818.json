My partner's entire family is entirely fluent in both the language I speak, as well as another language. When we're with my partner's family, 95% of the time, they speak the language I know. However, anytime there's any sort of disagreement or argument, they switch to the other language until the disagreement is resolved. To me, this feels really rude. If we're in the car or at the table and they switch languages, I'll be sitting there for several minutes at a time feeling very excluded. They know I don't speak the other language, so to me it feels like they're taking advantage of the language barrier to purposefully exclude me.\n\nAfter several requests to not be excluded from conversations, I've started to just get up and walk away from wherever we are when they switch languages, which my partner feels is very rude of me.\n\nShe says when I get up and walk away, I'm being an AH. I think it's a reasonable response and they're being AH's for excluding me. \n\nNote : I have started the beginning stages of trying to learn this other language myself but it's going to be quite some time before I'm anywhere near fluent enough to keep up.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693340641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164taip/aita_for_walking_away_when_my_partners_family/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, you\u2019re N T A , getting up and walking away is a valid response.\n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019ve said they\u2019re disagreeing and arguing. If they communicate better in the other language, especially when disagreeing, it\u2019s not really about you. In that case your response is making it about you and Y W B T A. The frustration is valid, and your Bf should have your back, but it sounds like they may already be making an effort.", "NTA\n\nYou've already clearly told them that this bothers you and asked that they don't do it... but they are ignoring that and doing it anyways, they are the AHs.", "yeah YTA. if they speak in english 95% of the time who cares if occasionally they prefer to speak in their other language esp when its nothing about you", "YTA.  You\u2019re not going to learn their language faster by walking away.  Sometimes, it\u2019s easier to express things faster in your native tongue, than try to convert it to your 2nd language.  It\u2019s not a slight to you and you shouldn\u2019t take it as one.  When they use a word or phrase that sounds interesting\u2026try to repeat it the best you can and ask for its translation, it\u2019s a quick way to learn.", "I have to go against the grain here. YTA. I wonder if any of the people in this thread have had the experience of being forced to speak (presumably English) for the benefit of one person. It\u2019s fine but while the English speaker is operating at 100 percent they are operating at 80 or worse communication wise. Especially about sensitive topic like arguments they want to be sure they\u2019re communicating clearly and the way for them to do that is their native language. Unless the disagreement is about you specifically suck it up or (crazy idea) learn the language.", "Honestly the main issue here is your partner. Your partner should be the one ensuring you're not being excluded from the conversation. Your partner should be the one pulling their family up on the rude behaviour. Your partner should be the one ensuring you feel comfortable around their family.\n\nI'd have a serious talk with your partner over why they're not backing you on this, because she's the one not doing what she should be doing.\n\nNTA.", "YTA - If the argument doesn't include you, why would you want to know what they are saying? An argument is not an open conversation, it's not like a nice chat anyone can jump on, so I don't know why they should argue and why you should care about other people's arguments.", "NTA - if they want to have a private conversation they can do it in private.  You\u2019re just giving them the space to do so.", "I'm going ESH - do they switch because you're the subject of the argument or part of it? OR are you not part of the argument at all and they switch? \n\nIf you're not part of the argument and you still walk away AH. You can ask your partner to relay the discussion while you're there or while you're learning the language. \n\nIf you're part of it and they switch NTA... Because why?? I'd feel insecure, anxious, and annoyed if I'm part of the discussion and then all of a sudden you switch languages and I can't understand.

If anything, you respecting their wishes of talking among themselves. Weird. NTA.", "NTA. And the code switch is specifically  to exclude you f4om the conversation. THAT'S the rudeness.", "YTA - why do you feel like you have the right to eavesdrop?", "Nta. It is pretty commonly accepted that speaking in a language as they are doing is considered very rude.  Please continue walking away. I have friends that did that when I was in school we were out with other friends that spoke spanish. So the two of us would pretend we spoke French. We spoke gibberish that sounded a bit like French.  After awhile our Spanish speaking friends complained we were rude! Then they finally realized how rude they were being and it stopped. Next time say something in a language that they dont understand before you walk away. Even if you have to make it up as you speak. Laugh while you look at them speaking the unknown language. Pretty soon someone will want to know what you are saying to or about them. What goes around comes around. Your in laws are very rude and proving they are very low class people without basic manners.", "NTA. Why is it ruder to walk away when you're being excluded, than to be excluded?\n\n I have many friends who know several languages, and have spoken them all so long that it's second nature.  As in they'll be speaking to me and slip into a la Guage I don't speak,  then laugh, apologize, and switch back. Or another friend whose native language is other than English may walk up, and they both seamlessly say something to each other in that language.  It's never meant to be excluding, and they never do it for more than a sec, and it's obvious they're just speaking in whatever language their mind flitted to in that moment. What they never do is just switch to another language and have a whole convo while I stand there rocking back and forth. **Only** time that might happen is if they need to speak to someone who only speaks the other language,  and they'll quickly let me know bf they do.\n\nNot saying your fam is doing it to be malicious, but they can absolutely be aware and do better. I think they just don't like the fact that you walking away makes it so obvious they're being rude.", "NTA.  The rudeness is switching to a language you don't understand to purposefully exclude you from certain conversations, which is exactly what they're doing.\n\nIf walking away is rude, you should just sit there very obviously scrolling through Insta occasionally showing your partner a post.", "NTA. Intentional or not, that being done *specifically excludes you* from the conversation. Yours is a valid boundary and you're not wrong for refusing to have it disrespected.", "NTA", "NAH but you are passing up a great learning opportunity.  Instead of walking away or zoning out, listen as carefully as you can.  Your comprehension will improve as you increase your vocabulary, but for now, listen to the cadences, the inflections, the structure.  It's hard as hell to learn a language by studying grammatical rules, but the more you hear it in use, the better ear you'll have for what sounds right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn\u2019t seem that they are trying to exclude OP, just to argue about something OP has no relation and speaking their native language happens without a though.
