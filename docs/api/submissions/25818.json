We spoke gibberish that sounded a bit like French.  After awhile our Spanish speaking friends complained we were rude! Then they finally realized how rude they were being and it stopped. Next time say something in a language that they dont understand before you walk away. Even if you have to make it up as you speak. Laugh while you look at them speaking the unknown language. Pretty soon someone will want to know what you are saying to or about them. What goes around comes around.

Or another friend whose native language is other than English may walk up, and they both seamlessly say something to each other in that language.

What they never do is just switch to another language and have a whole convo while I stand there rocking back and forth. **Only** time that might happen is if they need to speak to someone who only speaks the other language,  and they'll quickly let me know bf they do.\n\nNot saying your fam is doing it to be malicious, but they can absolutely be aware and do better.

You got into a relationship with a bilingual person. This is what it\u2019s like. \n\nLet me give an example. My parents own a business together. Whenever they talk about work, even at home, it\u2019s 90+% in English. But if they are ever discussing personal stuff or if the conversation gets heated, they overwhelmingly use Farsi. They use the language that feels most comfortable in the context with which they\u2019re accustomed to that language. It changes based on the subject, even though both are fully fluent in both languages. \n\nThis is life with a bilingual person. You knew going into this  relationship that your partner is bilingual. Are they and their family forever forbidden from using one of their native languages simply because you are ignorant of it? How is that fair to them, that they can only use this language when you are not present? \n\nAnother example from my own experience of being around a language I\u2019m not fluent in. I lived in Puerto Rico for some time. I am not fluent in Spanish but I was learning while I was there. People who were fluent in English constantly spoke Spanish around me and it wasn\u2019t at all personal, it\u2019s just what made them comfortable. It\u2019s their native tongue. \n\nI would never dream of demanding that they speak only English in my presence. That is woefully unfair. And honestly one of the ways I learned the language more was just by sitting and listening and trying to figure out what they are saying.\n\nNow if they are only using the native language to talk about you or purposely keep you out, then yes that is an asshole move.

That until you learn the language, there will be some conversations you get left out of. It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s just reality. \n\nYou can either learn to be comfortable with them speaking another language until you learn the language yourself or exit the relationship.

Why just sit there and pretend to be engaged somehow but not even know what\u2019s going on or what everyone is even mad at? I\u2019d also just walk away from people arguing in any language. That\u2019s pretty rude on their end, my family has never argued in front of my brothers girlfriend for example and they\u2019ve been dating for a while.

I empathize but I don't think it'll serve your relationship with your partner/their family if you keep reacting that way. Maybe it would be worth asking them why they do that to get some perspective. I know how it can feel like they're excluding you in the moment (and technically it is), but assuming the relationship is largely positive, it's likely not intentional. Your native language is the default to switch back to, especially when getting more animated or into a conversation, or an argument like you mentioned. Imagine trying to maintain an argument in a different language while you're heated lol. Especially for the sake of someone you're not arguing with. It would be hard.  In the moment do you ever ask them what they're talking about? How do they react?", "Yes. Omg yes. YTA. Language is about so much more than communication. And I can understand feeling excluded, but them speaking their native language is about connection with each other, not deliberately excluding you. If they were talking shit about you then I could understand, but you\u2019re mad because they\u2019re connecting with each other in the language with which they feel the most comfortable and at home? Especially given that they normally speak in your tongue when with you? I think you owe them all huge apologies. \n\nSorry if it seems harsh, but these kinds of culturally narcissistic responses from people in relationships with someone from a different culture seriously irk me. \n\nIf you want to feel included so badly, then learn the language. If you want to get up to speed more quickly, then *learn faster*.", "I'd like to clarify 1 point.

Your brain wants to revert.\n\nSo yes, you are a massive asshole for expecting a group of foreigners that share a language to speak English around you all the time because you want to be involved in every conversation and making this entirely about you. \n\nDo you also chuck a shit fit and storm off every time someone isn't speaking directly to you or having a conversation that you're not involved in?", "As a person who speaks multiple languages, YTA.", "NTA, tho they have every right to speak their language, you\u2019re not being rude by walking away.

WTF!", "You\u2019re not entitled to a front row seat and translation of their arguments. This sounds like a child throwing a tantrum because you don\u2019t get a show. 95% of the time in the same language is more than kind, especially when it\u2019s only for *your* benefit.

It has nothing to do with trying to exclude the rest of us, and all about comfort in a heated moment.\nI use English for very formal conversation, Portuguese mostly for emotional and familiar situations and Spanish for default. Sometimes, in heated, emotional moments, I switch between them. \nLearn the language they speak, and accept this about them, not you.", "NTA.

Spoke zero English going into Montessori\u2019s equivalent of a three year kindergarten (3yrs old to 6). Was fluent maybe six months later. \n\nIn a more similar vein to what you\u2019re talking about, my mother often spoke of how her friends and acquaintances would ask her to speak English to me and that they didn\u2019t understand what we were saying to each other, because she raised me speaking only French. She stuck to her guns and I\u2019m glad she did because I doubt I\u2019d be fluent in both as an adult if I\u2019d had English to fall back on, while being surrounded by English everywhere I went. \n\nMany years later, my kid is being raised with both French and English simultaneously and absolutely defaults to English. It\u2019s just easier. I do not hesitate to use French with others, while in front of non French speakers, if the situation or topic necessitates it.
