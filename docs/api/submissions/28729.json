If you have a boundary that your clothing is only for you, that is absolutely valid.\n\nIt's fine to share clothes when both parties agree to it.  She's TA for deciding that you must share your clothes, even though you've said you're not ok with it.", "Nta she is repeatedly crossing your boundary, and taking shit that isn't hers. That's how ABUSIVE relationships work, not healthy ones", "NTA. I\u2019ve never raided my partner\u2019s closet so no, that\u2019s not \u2018just how relationships are\u2019 but it\u2019s how she *wants* it to be. Unfortunately for her, her partner is not feeling it which means that she can\u2019t have that. And I get sweat shirts & tees, but your socks, underwear, and work pants? That\u2019s just ridiculous.", "NTA and her refusal to accept your boundary with the claim that this is just how relationships work is a whole field of \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and you likely need to start reconsidering this relationship\n\nETA: The fact that this behavior has only recently started and has been slowly getting worse, I'm willing to bet that if you look over the course of your whole relationship with this woman, she has been slowly escalating her boundary pushing in order to get you accustomed to it and to normalize it as a function of your relationship.", "NTA.  You broke up with her, right?", "Start wearing hers, when she complains that you stretch them out just say \"That's how relationship works, we share a wardrobe now, your rules, remember?\"", "NTA. It sounds like she's doing it to be close to you, which is only cute if she cares for them as if they were her own (wash and return to the shelf or closet where they belong) and if she asks you first (because they're yours, you should have first dibs on them for any given day). She is wrong about how relationships work, but that doesn't even matter if it doesn't work for you in your relationship.", "> I should just accept that this is how relationships work.\n\nIs a stupid statement from your ex gf, full stop. \n\nMove on with your life.

After being asked not to? Weird.", "NTA\n\nyou need to set boundaries with her. it is ridiculous that when you go to get clothes out she has already worn or is wearing them.\n\nRelationships do not work like that, I am pretty certain you don't wear her clothes", "NTA at all. You stated a very reasonable boundary, and she didn't respect it (or you) enough to comply. I would giver her an ultimatum about this. This shit doesn't just get better with time.", "Look... Tbh... No... this is not how relationships work. People happen to think being in a relationship means you have a free pass to everything in your partners life. No... there are boundries... there is personal space and it all needs to be respected..\n\nIf you're not comfortable sharing your clothes with her you need to speak to her clearly and set boundaries.. \nCommunication is key.\n\nBut ill say you could have handled the situation better. Don't bottle things up and blast off suddenly. Speak up on time and resolve issues peacefully.", "NTA. I'm a lesbian and my partner and I cohabitate and have the same shoe size and similar body sizes, so we are in the rare situation where we can both borrow each other's clothes, instead of only one borrowing from the other. We both enjoy seeing our own clothes on each other, and the feeling of wearing each other's clothes. It can be a cute relationship thing, absolutely. But, there need to be boundaries. \n\nWhat I do is ask her before using her clothes, in case there's special care instructions or she had plans to wear them later in the week. Sometimes, she'll tell me that I don't need to ask about a specific item, but I would always ask before putting on an item of hers I've never worn before, or if there's any doubt. \n\nYour gf seems young, but what she needs to understand that relationships aren't about sharing everything, they're about making your lives work together. Her wearing your clothes constantly to the point where you don't know what you have available and your work clothes are getting ruined isn't working for you. It doesn't matter so much what you do about these particular pants, but I hope she can understand the impact this has on you and the importance of hearing and respecting your boundaries.", "NTA- I like lounging in my BF'S t-shirts or hoodies to feel close to him, but it's with permission and ones he selects for me to wear/keep. Definitely It's called respecting boundaries and she's not being respectful of you.\n\nI think the conversation needs to be that you don't feel she is respecting your feelings and it makes you question if she values how you feel in the overall context in the relationship. I think it's fair to believe that this lack of respect could show up in bigger, more serious challenges that come up in relationships longterm.", "NTA.\n\n\"You should just accept it\" is how her relationships work, obviously, but not how healthy relationships work. A healthy relationship is a partnership, where each person actually respects the other. She's being a total asshole.", "NTA. I'm guessing she likes that they smell like you or she wants to be close to you, but there's a way for her to have that *and* be respectful towards you. She could have you pick out clothes for her to buy and wear them so that she can still experience that.\n\nDismissing your feelings and ignoring what you want instead of trying to find a solution shows that she doesn't respect you, and it's not healthy to date someone who doesn't show you respect and consideration. Your \"no\" matters, and it's concerning that she doesn't accept that.", "NTA.\n\nI get her point of view; men's clothes are comfy, big enough to cuddle into them, it's nice. I did it with my late husband's clothes, too. Hoodies, joggers, shirts - but not his work clothes.\n\nI'd say wear her nicest evening outfit while cooking Spaghetti Bolognese and look how she likes it.", "NTA.\n\nThey are your property, you get to decide who uses them.  And especially your work clothes.\n\nNo, this isn't how relationships work, she needs to accept this is a boundary and respect it or she's going to be single (or not dating you anymore anyway).", "Nta but please start taking and wearing her stuff. Please!!! With pictures \ud83e\udd79", ">Now in the aftermath I'm thinking I may have overreacted\n\nLmao, not at all\n\nNTA.

If she doesn't stop, start with her older clothes as you'll stretch them out, then move up to outfits she wears more often, and then to going dressed like that to her parents to ask them if they could have a word with her to get her to understand she's going through your wardrobe faster than you can wash it.", "Nta I get the sentimental aspect. I also enjoy wearing my husband's stuff occasionally, especially if one of us is away from home overnight. That being said she's being rude. If she wants to claim a shirt of your choosing that's cute and harmless. If she wants to constantly take your stuff and ruin it without replacing it that's entitled and inconsiderate.", "NTA\n\nI've claimed a hoodie or two over the years but never inconvenienced someone by swiping their entire wardrobe especially if they have asked me to stop wearing their things.", "Nta, she sounds creepy. Did she read this in a book a out relationships lol \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, that\u2019s not how relationships work at all.", "This is a total red flag NTA. Also you should break up with her. She sounds very pushy and constantly pushes past your boundaries. Your now defending her in your replies. I think your in denial of this being the start of a very abusive relationship. Hope your rose coloured glasses come off sooner rather then later for your sake.", "NTA. It\u2019s definitely excessive, ngl. I\u2019ve worn my husband\u2019s hoodie\u2019s or shirt's occasionally, but not ever to the point where he has nothing to wear, and I\u2019ve always put it back once done with it. Just start wearing her clothes around the house, don\u2019t wash them for her; just leave them in a pile once done. Make a point, and see if she still thinks that\u2019s just \u2018how relationships are\u2019 afterwards.", "My ex wife wore all my stuff including socks and boxers. I personally loved that it felt like a safe space to her. I think the work pants getting messed up is a step too far. There should always be boundaries there's cutesy comfort zones and then there's disrespectful and damaging your work clothes and not fixing it is disrespectful. Some thing come with a relationship and you accept them or move on and some things need to be addressed and shut down", "NTA - sadly I think she believes what\u2019s yours is hers and what\u2019s hers is hers\u2026.. if this is how she acts now think of the long run", "NTA, that's extremely inconsiderate behaviour, especially since you've told her repeatedly that it bothers you.", "NTA, you've stated a boundary so \"how relationships work\" means respecting that and finding something that works for you both. I don't get why she would even want to wear your work clothes tbh. I steal my partner's stuff pretty regularly, it's comfy, but not so much he is without clothing to wear and I def don't want his work outfits? \n\nMaybe have a talk about why she even wants your stuff, it should be something beyond just \"because that's what you do in a relationship\" and try to find a solution that works based on that.", "NTA\n\nYou did not overreact. I too enjoy floundering around in my partners clothes, I literally have his shirt on now. He has the same issue, all his stuff was missing, in the wash, or I was wearing it. Our agreement was for him to place his clothes I could wear in a specific drawer. I get to wear his clothes and he gets to have stuff. I would also replace the stuff I destroy during spaghetti night  \n\nYour gf isn\u2019t being reasonable and her refusal to compromise (or even be open to it) is very telling. In short, she\u2019s selfish and needs to grow up. GOOD relationships are not I get what I want while you suffer from the consequences of my actions. \n\nI would probably break up with her since she has no respect for your things BUT if you\u2019d like to be petty you could start wearing her things.", "NTA - you two have broken up, correct? I think she'll be in for a rude awakening in her next relationship.", "NTA it's one thing to grab a hoodie but she's really crossing the line wearing all your clothes. Has she explained why? Is she gaining weight and doesn't want to buy new clothes?", "This is not how relationships are. It\u2019s a compromise but each should respect the others items. Her not respecting that you have an issue with this is a issue in it self. She had her own clothes before you dated so she need to ware them.", "Start wearing here dress", "Dude, in a mild way, YTA. I mean, this girl is really into you. In a big way. She might not even realize it, but your clothes smell like you. She is immersing herself in YOU. It don't get any better than that. Enjoy it while it lasts. Buy more clothes. I simply can not believe how many people just want to jump in and say she's crossed some kind of line, she doesn't respect your boundaries. Blah, blah, blah. If someone ever was so obsessed with wearing my clothes, I'd be so flattered I don't think I'd have my feet on the ground.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like she is, well, *was* into you. This is often what the wearing of boyfriend clothes can mean, of course not always.\n\nMy wife wears my clothes quite a bit, the are comfy and have pockets and I honestly don't mind, she says it helps her feel safe and closer to me and she looks really good in everything I have, no matter how dumpy it is on me.\n\nMy response is that I will often wear something of hers, she has a few really awesome skirts I borrow.\n\nTurns out, it's a cool dynamic.\n\nI know this never works in the heat of the moment, but, man, relax some.", "Nta she ruined them and is not paying for them is a big problem. You don't get to act like a child and not pay the price. She wouldn't b able to borrow anything of mines. The boxers is extreme seriously. She is extremely disrespectful for crossing the boundary and her r spouse after ruining your work pants is a big no.", "Get out now!! She obviously doesn\u2019t respect you or care about your feelings", "OP  you didn\u2019t over react she won\u2019t learn if you don\u2019t implement proper consequences and if a \u201cfuck off\u201d and staying at your bros is what it takes then do it", "NTA\n\nBut really??  You yelled at her for spilling mountain dew on your pants??\n\nHave you asked her why she uses your clothes??\n\nAnd maybe start calling her 'dude' or a masculine version of her name when shes wearing your clothes..\n\nSeriously - closet trans???", "Wow! In case you don't recognize your condition, it's called P~ssy Whipped. Your choice, but she's not going to get any nicer.", "You definitely overreacted, to me if you tell your significant other to fuck off, you might as well just break up. I have worked construction my whole life, and I swear like a sailor. Never would I ever say that to my wife, ever. The amount of disrespect you are showing to the other person there, in my mind, is astronomically large. \n\nThis said, she's being incredibly rude herself here, it's one thing to wear a sweater or a shirt or whatever, but your wardrobe is yours, and she isn't respecting you much, either. She's the asshole here, but you made yourself one too when you reacted the way you did.\n\nESH.", "YTA for telling her to fuck off. this whole description screams miscommunication. you clearly stated you don\u2019t mind her wearing your clothes. you said recently she\u2019s been wearing them more frequently etc. have you talked to her about this? have you expressed how you feel about it? if not, start there and see if you can effectively communicate a solution. \n\nshe should have offered to pay for new pants, but you said in the comments that you understand why she couldn\u2019t because they were expensive. \n\nyou\u2019re not a major ahole, but sounds like you overreacted and maybe miscommunicated.", "You're being oblivious. People wear their SO's clothes because they really like the person. Also, you know Mountain Dew washes out, right? It wasn't blueberry pie. Massive overreaction. It's all academic, though. The relationship ended when you told her to fuck off and left.", "ESH but mostly NTA, you're getting dinged in my book for telling your GIRLFRIEND to FUCK OFF. I mean come on, even in an escalated situation or fight there is little to no room for that type of statement. \n\nIs she being inconsiderate and selfish? Yes. Is it fair for you to be frustrated and to insist that she address the issue? Yes. Those are the things to focus on. But hopefully your blow up doesn't end up clouding the issue and preventing it from being resolved.", "I guess this is not a common answer here but, YTA. If you\u2019ve never expressed to her before that you don\u2019t want her wearing certain items of clothing, then going off on her like that was completely uncalled for. I get it because it\u2019s work pants, but it\u2019s Mountain Dew lol. Put it in the wash and it\u2019ll come out just fine. \n\nMaybe from this point forward you can tell her which items are off limits. I raid my boyfriends closet all the time. It\u2019s a little different because I have to travel to a different country to see him so my clothing options are really dwindled down, but I\u2019d say half the time when I\u2019m with him every item of clothing I\u2019m wearing is his aside from socks and underwear. I think it\u2019s completely normal that she wants to wear your clothes. They smell like you! They remind her of you! It\u2019s endearing. \n\nWhen you talk to her about this, I\u2019d start by saying you are sorry and you overreacted. Then explain where you were coming from. Then you guys can decide that maybe she only wears casual clothing like your sweats and casual tees, etc. \n\nAgain, apparently I\u2019m in the minority here, but I definitely think you could\u2019ve approached the situation differently.", "I don't think you understand why she wanted the clothes. It's not about them being from the men's section, it's about them being from YOU. They smell like you, feel like you. So your suggestion that she should just get her own clothes was kinda pointless. That's just a little FYI\n\nEither way, she she shouldn't take all your clothes, it's not like you can go naked. And she also should have either paid for new work pants or at least for the wash.\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH (but mostly her) because you two didn't seem to be able to properly communicate and compromise with each other.", "Info:  do you understand you can wash clothes?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I imagine your wife isn't ruining clothes and just saying \n\n\n\"oopsie oh well I gues YOULL have to replace it\"\n\nNot to mention the complete disregard for the concept of boundaries. Your excuse is litteraly \"wrll you can't always enforce your boundaries so you might as well forget having them.\" \n\nNo I very much van enforce them and OP should not be with someone who doesn't respect them.", "She ruined the $70 pants, so she gets to pay for them. It would be one thing if you had been okay with her wearing them, but her actions were malicious.", "It\u2019s not about the cost, it\u2019s that she is blatantly disrespecting you. If the roles were reversed she would get pissed. I\u2019d never do that to my partner- stealing his sweater? I do it every now and then, but if he told me to not do it? Guess what? I wouldn\u2019t do it! She\u2019s very immature and disrespectful.", "That's even worse. Listen you don't get ruin an item and not expect to not have to reimburse someone.", "And if she ever crashes your car she won\u2019t pay for it. And if she ever loses your social security number she won\u2019t help you get a new one. And if she spends all your paycheck on fun stuff she won\u2019t help. \n\nYour girlfriend has a lack of accountability. That\u2019s the problem, not the cash. You shouldn\u2019t be willing to put up with that sort of behavior.", "Then she shouldn't have put them on. She doesn't even ask? \n\nWhat she is doing is incredibly disrespectful to both you and your money. It doesn't matter that she doesn't want to pay it back, she ruined your pants. She didn't even ask before taking them. You are being a little too understanding here - which may be why she thinks she can get away with this.\n\nI grew up w/ a mom and 2 sisters. We borrowed clothes, but there were rules. 1. You ALWAYS ask first. 2. You wash it right away and give it back. Iron it if it was ironed when you used it. The lender should be able to wear it the next day if they want to 3. If you broke it, yiu buy it. 4. My wardrobe is not a replacement for your wardrobe and borrowing clothes is the exception, not the rule. 5. You never ask to borrow something just purchased. The owner should get a honeymoon period w/ any new clothes.\n\nI had roommates throughout college, includong.mybest friend, and even though we didn't really discuss it, the unwritten rules worked the same way. \n\nI've lived w/ boyfriends. Same. \n\nWhat your GF is describing is NOT how relationships work.", "Then you don\u2019t wear that or you are responsible for a new pair if you ruin them. That is what mature adults do.", "So it's okay for her to wear and ruin your expensive things because you're afraid to set a boundary that could alienate her (and we can't have that!) \n\nDo you hear yourself, OP?  \n\nYou're going to fuck around and find that Jada & Will love."]}
