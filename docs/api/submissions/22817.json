In this world where participation trophies are still the norm, you set out a goal for your kids. It was the same goal for both. It sounds like you provided academic support to your daughter, too. \n\nI also have high achieving kids, that I trained up to be that way. Where I live a car is minimal transportation. We have provided used cars for our kids, and I'm even sending one off with my son when he leaves for grad school in 2 weeks. I didn't put any stipulations on that. Also, in raising my boys to get their straight As, I didn't promise them anything for it. It was an expectation that they'd be successful. Everyone is different in how they parent. Perhaps it made a difference for your son. I reckon that he would have been successful regardless. \n\nThe only thing that I am deeply concerned about is that it looks like your daughter lost her mother while she was in high school, based on your later comments. This makes your empathy for her situation, and your need for meta-communication and communication even more important. \n\nIf my daughter said, \"what about my car?\" thinking a used one was coming her way, I think a discussion rather than a hard \"No.\" was in order. Clearly your extended family has a lot of sympathy for your daughter's situation.

I\u2019m inclined to think so because of your family\u2019s reaction. You might not have deliberately done it, you might not even be aware of it yourself, it might have been subconsciously, but reflect on your attitude with Lana and Roman over the last few years.

If the 'prize' was something smaller like a hundred quid then fair enough. But buying a car is a big step in a person's life.

While the bar may have been the same each needed to put in an incredibly different amount of work (ex. I had well above a 3.5 in high school too, did tons of extracurriculars, held numerous leadership positions, multiple ap/college level courses. I did not have to work particularly hard academically to do well and rarely studied. My younger sib didn't do well academically and had to spend hours studying just to pass. The amount of work and effort my siblings put in far exceed what I put in.) While life in general isn't fair, you have the opportunity to both acknowledge that and acknowledge the work your kid put in just to graduate (which you acknowledge wasn't a sure thing!) and help set your kid up for their future with a means of transportation.", "YTA, I'm afraid.  It sounds like you can afford to provide a used car to help Lana get started in life with no problem if you could have afforded a new car had her grades been more to your liking.  \n\nSchool is not as easy for some kids for all sorts of reasons.  To have insisted on such a high gpa was a standard that many children cannot manage.  Apparently Lana had difficulty with her classes but it also sounds like she worked hard at trying to do better.  It's indeed possible that she worked harder even than your son who is apparently quite bright and maybe school just came easier for him.  He IS your golden child but Lana is your child too and doesn't need to be treated as if she deserves nothing because, try as she did, she just could not rack up those A's. \n\nYou screwed up and need to figure a way to make this right.

Whatever her grades were at that time, you had 3 more years to help her do better academically, set herself up for success in the future, and remind her that the car was contingent on grades.  You say she struggled and needed tutoring, and are proud of her working so hard to pass, so the grades are not from lack of effort, she probably has some form of learning disability that went undiagnosed, compounded by shame that the same academic things just came natural to her older brother.    \n\n\nYou had 3 years between Ronan's car, and her graduation to manage her expectations of what you would be willing to do, and you didn't.  You knew graduation was approaching, and you didn't discuss options of what you would be willing to contribute towards a car.  So she feels betrayed, and hung out on her own to completely fend for herself.  You even described that with 3.5 gpa they would get a \"new car\", but she was looking at more modestly priced used cars, and with what money did you think she was going to buy one?  \n\n\nAs a parent, you **may** have done all you could to help her get good grades and they just didn't happen.  However, you definitely didn't do anything to cushion the blow that was coming to her.", "INFO\n\n1. What does Lana's mother say?\n2. Is it possible that Lana has an undiagnosed learning disability?

How would she get to community college without a car? Would you drive her there and back?", "YTA if your daughter put in the effort, it sounds like she did.\nLet me put it this way; if you promised them in middle school that you would give them a car if they could complete a 1 mile run at the age of 18, and your daughter then lost a leg in high school but still tried to train for the race, would you then still think it\u2019s fair that only your son got a car at 18, when your daughter tried her best to complete but just couldn\u2019t?", "This is a case of miscommunication. She assumed that getting good grades would get a new car but failing to get good grades would get a used car. \n\nThe adult who made the promise should have made it clear that the deal was graded gets car, no grades gets no car. \n\nBut YTA in any event.  \n\nEnjoy not understanding why she goes no contact with you in a few years.", "YTA, not because you didn't get her the car, but because you're teaching your children all the wrong lessons in life. As a parent, nothing should matter to you more than the work your children put into achieving whatever they achieve - even if it's a 2.0 GPA. You mentioned you're proud of the effort she's put in, but does she actually know it at all? And even if you think she does, how does she prove that to herself, when her brother might have put in the same amount of effort (albeit with different results) and gotten what she was told she wasn't 'good enough' to get? \n\nYour children should not be learning to achieve for the sake of achieving. They should be learning how to put their all into whatever they choose to do. Your daughter worked hard, and received nowhere near the consideration your son did. I know her results weren't satisfactory to YOU, but are you not going to reward her work AT ALL? I'm not saying you get her a brand new car, and neither is she! She was the one who decided to come to you with options for a used car! \n\nYour children will grow up knowing nothing matters more than what the end result is, no matter how hard or efficiently they work, and it will fuck them over later in life.", "ESH. You set a goal that your daughter couldn't achieve and never revisited it when it became clear that putting the same amount of work in as your son would not ever result in the same reward. A more appropriate thing to do would have been to have a discussion about how proud you were of her effort, and what alternative reward she would like since she was unlikely to get the car. She shouldn't have assumed she would be getting a reward for not achieving the goal without talking to you about it, nor misrepresented the situation to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son does seem to be the golden child, though. You may not notice your own favoritism, but you express it all the same. Your daughter clearly feels it, and probably doesn't understand why (his academic talent, not his gender); there may also be internalized sexism you don't notice but she does (everyone has socialized and unconscious bias--recognizing when you're giving in to them is hard, especially since you're not on the recieving end). At this point family therapy might be your best option, but of course it does require you all put in effort.\n\nAt the very least, instead of playing who's-the-A, your best strategy is to have a discussion where you explain that you are proud of her accomplishments and efforts, and you want to offer a reward that she has some say in, but you didn't like how she assumed she would be getting a reward she hadn't met the stipulations for (note: do NOT say 'hasn't earned' bc that's just creating a fight, as the connotations of 'earned' are complex and subjective). It may be the same reward but you change the requirements to be something she can achieve with reasonable effort (What is she actually good at? What are her long term goals?), or it might be a different reward of similar value that helps her accomplish her own life goals. Just remember to make some time to listen and let her vent, and be aware she may bring up grievances you weren't aware of--and some that may reflect her friends' experiences or her experiences with other adult men instead of her own with you. Rather than defending yourself immediately, try 'I haven't recognized that in myself before. I need some time to reflect and see if I can learn to identify those behaviors/attitudes when they happen unconsciously.' It shows you're at least listening, and prevents the conversation from becoming an argument ('I do NOT do that' rarely leads to productive conversation). You've clearly offered support to your daughter over time, with tutoring and therapy and other services, so it's clear you care about her and your relationship. Now it's time to look at how flexibility and individualized goals can improve it.", "YTA - you set a goal you knew only your son could accomplish. Seems like he is the golden child and your daughter is an after-thought.", "Yes, YTA. It's cool your daughter has some decent relatives who did the right thing.", "NTA.

But instead you actually just care about how book smart they are. Some kids can excel in school without even trying and some kids have to bust their asses just to do average. I'm sure your daughter has other skills that she excels at, so what you should be doing is encouraging your kid to work hard at finding what she is good at and what she enjoys and what will help her be an independent adult that makes good decisions.

I'm sure you've always known that your daughter wasn't much of a scholar so of course it would seem to her that you're playing favorites because your son is bright and would most likely exceed a 3.5 and she wouldn't.\n\nYou said she had tutors all 4 years so she obviously tried. Some people are just more naturally gifted at school. And why do you mention the extra curriculars that your son did and mention that your daughter didn't?

She obviously knows she didn\u2019t do as well as her brother, since she asked you for a used car while her brother got a nice brand-new one. You should have just bought her the car.", "YTA.  A used car would have been a reasonable acknowledgement of Lana's efforts and the fact that she still graduated even if her GPA wasn't the 3.5 requirement for a new car.  You knew that Ronan was significantly more academically gifted when you set this arrangement up.  You also knew that Lana worked hard, tried her best, and graduated from high school even though you weren't sure she'd be able to graduate.  \n\nYou DID show favoritism.  Don't try to pretend you didn't, when you were well aware of their differences in academic ability from the start.

My daughter also knows that I make just as much a show of his more modest success as her objectively greater success and the reasons behind.  She fully supports it and goes out of her way to be just as supportive of him especially since there's a 12 year age gap between them.

Even the teachers who taught my sibling before me did made me feel bad about myself. \n\nMy sibling went to a good university and I opted for community college because I didn't want to be a burden to my parents like my sibling was. The university was 6 blocks away and the community college was 4 counties away.\n\nI asked if I could use the spare car instead of taking the 45 minute bus ride for one day so I can make it to work an hour earlier after classes. My dad literally told me that my older sibling needs the car more than I do to go to the university.", "That doesn't mean it was easy for the son. He was valedictorian in school (super different from top 10 percent), he played 3 varsity sports, had a bunch of extracurriculars, and got into an Ivy League school. I'm willing to bet money that he did work his ass off and that it was not that easy", "I was wondering the same. If she was working hard for four years, got tutored, and still only managed to get Cs and Ds there's something else going on but OP completely ignored it because he has his perfect son.\n\nAlso, extracurriculars during pandemic? Seriously?", "And there were minimal Extra curriculars during her highschool tenure due to the PANAINI (i just had to because of a commenter above used that term LOL)", "Depends on state and what school you went to, I had believe a little over 4.1 (due to Honor and AP) would need to double check, and did 1 extracurricular (never mentioned in application,) but still received enough scholarships for full ride and then some.", "yeah, i think the opposite is almost more true. that people who sail thru high school not having to try have a wide awakening when they get to college.\n\none of my cousins had a good memory- not photographic- but good enough that he didn't have to do a lot of work in high school. college was a rude awakening for him.", "OP is clearly pretty well off if this is even an issue he\u2019s having. It probably was barely even a thought to get his daughter tutoring. Through school I knew of a few kids who had all kinds of out of school academic help, but were basically doing it just to pay lip service to trying.", "Probably not. Almost every female I know with a learning disability (that wasn\u2019t blatantly obvious like dyslexia) wasn\u2019t diagnosed until very late in high school or adulthood. Myself included. It\u2019s easiest for them to just tell girls that they\u2019re \u201cnot living up to your potential\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re smart you just need to *apply* yourself\u201d until they\u2019re blue in the face and the girl is out of options and time. \n\nThe system is failing women miserably because the criteria is built off of boys.", "No, a hot sandwich on toasted Italian bread. Their deliciousness can be quite distracting. Shame on the school for having them available when the students need to focus.", "Panoramic.", "Just wait until you hear about marinara flags!", "There's nothing to suggest that she didn't go to tutoring. By OPs own admission she worked very hard.", "What if she has an undiagnosed learning disability? I went to tutoring every day to no avail and just being called stupid. When a very observant and kind college professor noticed my struggles, she asked to see her after class. She introduced me to her best friend who was a professor who teaches special education teachers. That friend tested me, and turns out, I am LD (dyscalculia and ADHD). Once she gave me pointers on how to approach academics to my neurotype, my grades went up.", "Not to mention he makes the comment about her not doing extracurricular and if she\u2019s putting all her energy into studying what does he expect?", "3.5 average. Not 3.0. She needed a B+ and the difference is significant enough to point out.", "The son probably takes after his mother in the brains department.", "This is where I stand. Yeah the son had way better results, but were their efforts all that different? Maybe don\u2019t get the daughter a brand new car of her choosing but an older one would\u2019ve been a good compromise.", "not her dad that's for sure", "I guess you'd measure it by how long they spent studying and how seriously they take the test. It would probably have to take into account the individual's ability to learn and retain information, like some people are naturally good at spelling so they wouldn't have to work as hard, but they could also be crap at maths so they'd really have to work at it.", "No, they don\u2019t do scholarship based on \u201cmerit, talent or athletic ability\u201d. They do in grad school, but this is obviously undergrad. You can get external scholarships, but if you\u2019re talking about the school, they give financial aid. AMAZING financial aid, but just financial aid.\n\nI believe there are some limited opportunity scholarships, but agin, that isn\u2019t based on merit, it\u2019s to give disadvantaged minorities an equal chance at quality education, though don\u2019t quote me since I\u2019m not familiar enough to say definitively, I only know from friends who had one.", "I was gifted in elementary school. I got put in an advanced program that only 10 other kids in my grade were in. High school? Nope. Almost failed out my sophomore year.", "He straight up admits in comments that she misunderstood the deal from the beginning and he never knew and never corrected her.", "First off, he is purposefully painting his daughter in a bad light to make himself look better so you really have to take everything he\u2019s saying with a grain of salt. Second, it is NORMAL for teenagers to make flippant offhand comments about things, they may mean them and they may not. And even if she did mean it, that doesn\u2019t show that she hates school and doesn\u2019t prioritize learning. I cared very much about doing well in school but I hated extracurriculars. My time was mine.", "THIS. She also had a tutor, how is it even possible her grades were so bad and nobody thought about something going on?", "He may have graduated before the pandemic began, I haven\u2019t checked to see if OP has replied to any comments or clarified yet. My assumption is that he was able to experience high school before the pandemic began, especially since OP didn\u2019t mention his daughter participating in any and didn\u2019t seem to hold it against her. I have a feeling if she had been able to participate in them and chose not to or didn\u2019t qualify due to grades he would have mentioned that as a point against her in the post.\n\nEven if it\u2019s not ADHD or learning differences she likely experienced a lot of stress and things that got in the way of learning and succeeding that her brother didn\u2019t if he was able to finish school before the pandemic changed things. The system already works against students and causes major issues, flailing around trying to completely figure out how to still provide education while unable to attend in person made it harder for so many kids who already needed more than what they were getting.\n\nOP is acting like she just wasn\u2019t capable, as if outside factors had nothing to do with her struggles. He cares about success as far as I can tell, not helping his kids do well. Learning how to learn is more important than memorizing shit.", "Why would you gender this at all?  Pretty sure the original comment referred to college students who should've been tested and provided accomodations for not just females? This feels like some good ole personal bias just complaining about a prooblem that doesn't exist", "Oh right, the panini. The panini for Kuzco.", "I was one of the original people who used panini. We were not allowed to say the p word in relation to school stuff due to young kids and making it a safe environment. I used panini here because it's just a habit.  It well could have been pandora, panoramic, panama, palacio, panorama, paradoxical, pandemonium, etc. Odd to see it steeped so much over the years", "Oh. Crap. I still like my answer better, accuracy notwithstanding.", "If my school cafeteria offered panini I'd have been screaming with excitement at the thought, I must admit.", "Gazpacho police gonna come after those marinara flags unless you can COVFEFE", "If as since here.", "That's what I am saying. If he was was trying to get effort and got a lot of effort then why be petty.", "This.  I grew up with undiagnosed ADHD and struggled horribly in school.  And neurodivergent girls still fall through the cracks with depressing regularity even now.", "I'm the same way, along with dyslexia with numbers, not words which is why I wasn't diagnosed earlier. I had petty mal seizures and short term memory problems due to epilepsy.  So I was getting tutored. There was no way I could make a B or above average no matter how much I studied.", "This is what I'm thinking about Lana.  She is struggling and may well be working just as hard as her brother.  Kids with learning disabilities have to work so hard just to pass.\n\nI led a group of parents with kids who had special needs.  The kids worked so hard to get called stupid or lazy by people who didn't understand.\n\nOP is YTA.", "I was just typing this.  OP is the AH.  All that tutoring and she still struggled???? Not every kid will ace school and you can\u2019t compare siblings.", "Yes!", "Bwahahahaha! Good one!", "Wait, what? Where does OP mention the mother?", "Yes, all of this is so true.", "This all sounds like a very different problem with very different causes and complications than actually grading on a curve, so I hope you understand my confusion.\n\n> Grade inflation and weighing in high school have been bad for at least the last twenty years\u2014It\u2019s only increased as an issue over time. A 4.0 in 2023 means less than it did decades ago and, unless you go to a school that explicitly rejects efforts to curve/weight/inflate grades, a 4.0 means that you avoided more challenging classes and/or didn\u2019t get straight As because otherwise your GPA would be well over a 4.0\n\nI'm aware of this as something implemented to solve the problem that joining honors classes tended to hurt college prospects by bringing your GPA down because you're actually taking challenging classes, but I don't know a lot about the specifics. Do you think the solution is worse than the problem it was meant to solve?\n\nEdit: On the topic of the thread, I do see how OP's son getting higher than 3.5 would have been relatively easier given the weights on honor classes, though.", "But honestly what **is** the point of putting a lot of time into a club she isn't interested in? I did zero school clubs and I still went to college. I'm sure she has things she's passionate about, they just don't translate into a neat resume bullet point like clearly you want them to.", "She sounds defeated/depressed; like she knew she wouldn't be \"good enough\" so why bother. Did you ever talk up her accomplishments, no matter how small, or was it always about buckling down and doing better?", "Wow, you really dislike your daughter don\u2019t you.", "That sounds like deflection from someone who knows that she won\u2019t be able to keep doing things she likes, so better not to start.", "I had the same attitude towards clubs because I hated school. You know why I hated school? No one realized I had a learning disability and my tutor didn\u2019t help because my tutor wasn\u2019t trained for learning disabilities. She was a college student helping out middle schoolers.", "Absolute YTA.", "Also I\u2019d like to add that it makes total sense to hate something you\u2019re bad at. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to try hard and fail at something and a common defense to that is to devalue it.", "\"Lana knew she hadn't met the terms of the agreement and expected the same reward anyway.\"\n\nShe didn't, though. The deal was if a 3.5 average was attained, they would get a NEW car. She knew she hadn't achieved that, so she asked for a USED one. That's not the same reward. Father then says, \"NO car\" despite acknowledging she HAD worked hard to graduate. \n\nHis comment that she could just take public transportation and ask Dad for rides seems to imply that he'd prefer to keep an eye on her, under his thumb.", "So was a lot of others that still passed with good grades", "Thanks for asking. The Italian sandwich was making do mental gymnastics trying to make it fit lol", "Hahaha I was unaware of the substitute word too! I was trying to figure out what a panini was.", "This sub used to delete any posts about COVID and the pandemic.", "Yeah but I think it just became a fun thing to be silly about at a time when we were all\u2026 let\u2019s face it\u2026 losing our ever loving minds. Like \u201cexcuse you sir, there is a *pancake* right now\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019ve had just about enough of this *panda bear*.\u201d", "A few subs did actually ban it.", "Yep. Diagnosed dyscalculia at 27, ADHD at 37 and autism spectrum at 49. It made school HELL and my family of origin treated me like garbage. I no longer speak with all but 2 of them and even that is taxing.\n\nI think Lana is going to either disown OP or go very low contact if he keeps up with fawning over Ronan and shitting on her.", "I'm glad people found my joke funny, I was afraid my joke would get me banned.", "Yes, it\u2019s a problem for which I\u2019m not sure that there is a better solution for the reason you highlighted: You don\u2019t want kids punished for pursuing more rigorous classes and potentially getting worse grades.", "Completely agree with everything you just said but I would also like to add another detail. OP mentions in the comments that their mother died. His daughter is mourning and this how he treats her. Big asshole behavior and definitely misogynistic.", "Autocorrect used to change my son\u2019s name to Cancer. It\u2019s turned off forever.", "I just had auto correct go from mustard to mistress. So it read, \"what the fuck am I gonna do with a half gallon mistress?\"", "Every time I try to wish someone a happy birthday, iPhone tries to trick me into wishing them happy burial instead.", "Yeah, someone did that on purpose. Did you have a jealous girlfriend by any chance?", "My phone corrects Jack to Jackass every time. Capital J, too.

I couldn\u2019t stop laughing after he wrote back \u201c???\u201d Even now it makes me chuckle", "It used to change my niece's name to alumni, her name begins with a k.", "its not because covid and pandemic were forbidden words, its because this sub really is not a debate forum about vaccines  and pandemic laws.", "It was prefect", "\"I have stay late at work today, can you go get cancer?\"  LMAO", "Yikes! Can't blame you for shutting it off.  \nAutocorrect also changes the names of my eldest grandsons when my daughter texts me.
