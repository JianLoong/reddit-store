In this world where participation trophies are still the norm, you set out a goal for your kids. It was the same goal for both. It sounds like you provided academic support to your daughter, too. \n\nI also have high achieving kids, that I trained up to be that way. Where I live a car is minimal transportation. We have provided used cars for our kids, and I'm even sending one off with my son when he leaves for grad school in 2 weeks. I didn't put any stipulations on that. Also, in raising my boys to get their straight As, I didn't promise them anything for it. It was an expectation that they'd be successful. Everyone is different in how they parent. Perhaps it made a difference for your son. I reckon that he would have been successful regardless. \n\nThe only thing that I am deeply concerned about is that it looks like your daughter lost her mother while she was in high school, based on your later comments. This makes your empathy for her situation, and your need for meta-communication and communication even more important. \n\nIf my daughter said, \"what about my car?\" thinking a used one was coming her way, I think a discussion rather than a hard \"No.\" was in order. Clearly your extended family has a lot of sympathy for your daughter's situation.

I\u2019m inclined to think so because of your family\u2019s reaction. You might not have deliberately done it, you might not even be aware of it yourself, it might have been subconsciously, but reflect on your attitude with Lana and Roman over the last few years. Were you easily frustrated with Lana? Did you make any remarks of comparison directly or indirectly, to her face or other relatives that got back to her?We\u2019re there more \u201cthat\u2019s my boy \u201c than \u201cthat\u2019s my girl\u201dmoments? You said you were proud of her hard work but did you say it out loud ? Are there things other than academics that you place value in and praise your children for?

If the 'prize' was something smaller like a hundred quid then fair enough. But buying a car is a big step in a person's life. If I seen my older brother get something over me because he had better grades, I'd be devastated.

While the bar may have been the same each needed to put in an incredibly different amount of work (ex. I had well above a 3.5 in high school too, did tons of extracurriculars, held numerous leadership positions, multiple ap/college level courses. I did not have to work particularly hard academically to do well and rarely studied. My younger sib didn't do well academically and had to spend hours studying just to pass. The amount of work and effort my siblings put in far exceed what I put in.) While life in general isn't fair, you have the opportunity to both acknowledge that and acknowledge the work your kid put in just to graduate (which you acknowledge wasn't a sure thing!) and help set your kid up for their future with a means of transportation.", "YTA, I'm afraid.  It sounds like you can afford to provide a used car to help Lana get started in life with no problem if you could have afforded a new car had her grades been more to your liking.  \n\nSchool is not as easy for some kids for all sorts of reasons.  To have insisted on such a high gpa was a standard that many children cannot manage.  Apparently Lana had difficulty with her classes but it also sounds like she worked hard at trying to do better.  It's indeed possible that she worked harder even than your son who is apparently quite bright and maybe school just came easier for him.  He IS your golden child but Lana is your child too and doesn't need to be treated as if she deserves nothing because, try as she did, she just could not rack up those A's. \n\nYou screwed up and need to figure a way to make this right.  Lana needs some help with transportation and, if you are able to help with this, you should have cared to do so.  To punish her for in effect not being as bright as her brother is not right.

Whatever her grades were at that time, you had 3 more years to help her do better academically, set herself up for success in the future, and remind her that the car was contingent on grades.  You say she struggled and needed tutoring, and are proud of her working so hard to pass, so the grades are not from lack of effort, she probably has some form of learning disability that went undiagnosed, compounded by shame that the same academic things just came natural to her older brother.    \n\n\nYou had 3 years between Ronan's car, and her graduation to manage her expectations of what you would be willing to do, and you didn't.  You knew graduation was approaching, and you didn't discuss options of what you would be willing to contribute towards a car.  So she feels betrayed, and hung out on her own to completely fend for herself.  You even described that with 3.5 gpa they would get a \"new car\", but she was looking at more modestly priced used cars, and with what money did you think she was going to buy one?  \n\n\nAs a parent, you **may** have done all you could to help her get good grades and they just didn't happen.  However, you definitely didn't do anything to cushion the blow that was coming to her.", "INFO\n\n1. What does Lana's mother say?\n2. Is it possible that Lana has an undiagnosed learning disability?

How would she get to community college without a car? Would you drive her there and back?", "YTA if your daughter put in the effort, it sounds like she did.\nLet me put it this way; if you promised them in middle school that you would give them a car if they could complete a 1 mile run at the age of 18, and your daughter then lost a leg in high school but still tried to train for the race, would you then still think it\u2019s fair that only your son got a car at 18, when your daughter tried her best to complete but just couldn\u2019t?", "This is a case of miscommunication. She assumed that getting good grades would get a new car but failing to get good grades would get a used car. \n\nThe adult who made the promise should have made it clear that the deal was graded gets car, no grades gets no car. \n\nBut YTA in any event.  \n\nEnjoy not understanding why she goes no contact with you in a few years.", "YTA, not because you didn't get her the car, but because you're teaching your children all the wrong lessons in life. As a parent, nothing should matter to you more than the work your children put into achieving whatever they achieve - even if it's a 2.0 GPA. You mentioned you're proud of the effort she's put in, but does she actually know it at all? And even if you think she does, how does she prove that to herself, when her brother might have put in the same amount of effort (albeit with different results) and gotten what she was told she wasn't 'good enough' to get? \n\nYour children should not be learning to achieve for the sake of achieving. They should be learning how to put their all into whatever they choose to do. Your daughter worked hard, and received nowhere near the consideration your son did. I know her results weren't satisfactory to YOU, but are you not going to reward her work AT ALL? I'm not saying you get her a brand new car, and neither is she! She was the one who decided to come to you with options for a used car! \n\nYour children will grow up knowing nothing matters more than what the end result is, no matter how hard or efficiently they work, and it will fuck them over later in life.", "ESH. You set a goal that your daughter couldn't achieve and never revisited it when it became clear that putting the same amount of work in as your son would not ever result in the same reward. A more appropriate thing to do would have been to have a discussion about how proud you were of her effort, and what alternative reward she would like since she was unlikely to get the car. She shouldn't have assumed she would be getting a reward for not achieving the goal without talking to you about it, nor misrepresented the situation to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son does seem to be the golden child, though. You may not notice your own favoritism, but you express it all the same. Your daughter clearly feels it, and probably doesn't understand why (his academic talent, not his gender); there may also be internalized sexism you don't notice but she does (everyone has socialized and unconscious bias--recognizing when you're giving in to them is hard, especially since you're not on the recieving end). At this point family therapy might be your best option, but of course it does require you all put in effort.\n\nAt the very least, instead of playing who's-the-A, your best strategy is to have a discussion where you explain that you are proud of her accomplishments and efforts, and you want to offer a reward that she has some say in, but you didn't like how she assumed she would be getting a reward she hadn't met the stipulations for (note: do NOT say 'hasn't earned' bc that's just creating a fight, as the connotations of 'earned' are complex and subjective). It may be the same reward but you change the requirements to be something she can achieve with reasonable effort (What is she actually good at? What are her long term goals?), or it might be a different reward of similar value that helps her accomplish her own life goals. Just remember to make some time to listen and let her vent, and be aware she may bring up grievances you weren't aware of--and some that may reflect her friends' experiences or her experiences with other adult men instead of her own with you. Rather than defending yourself immediately, try 'I haven't recognized that in myself before. I need some time to reflect and see if I can learn to identify those behaviors/attitudes when they happen unconsciously.' It shows you're at least listening, and prevents the conversation from becoming an argument ('I do NOT do that' rarely leads to productive conversation). You've clearly offered support to your daughter over time, with tutoring and therapy and other services, so it's clear you care about her and your relationship. Now it's time to look at how flexibility and individualized goals can improve it.", "YTA - you set a goal you knew only your son could accomplish. Seems like he is the golden child and your daughter is an after-thought.", "Yes, YTA. It's cool your daughter has some decent relatives who did the right thing.", "NTA. She didn't live up to her end of the agreement. Had you bought her one, it would have been disrespectful to your son, who busted his ass to do well in school.", "NTA Honestly. There is going to be a lot of vitriol directed at you by people though, so good luck.", "YTA.\n\nThe point of setting a high gpa goal should have been to convince your kids to have a goal to work hard. But instead you actually just care about how book smart they are. Some kids can excel in school without even trying and some kids have to bust their asses just to do average. I'm sure your daughter has other skills that she excels at, so what you should be doing is encouraging your kid to work hard at finding what she is good at and what she enjoys and what will help her be an independent adult that makes good decisions. But instead of caring about that, you care about a stupid number.", "How is he the AH, she failed the requirements?", "NTA. You have both kids the same deal. One chose to work for it.

You would have had a pretty good idea at the start of high school that it would be easy for Ronan to meet the requirements but not his sister. Also, your YTA for not reminding her of the requirement, it really shouldn't have been a surprise.", "The only one who is on your side is the perfect son you're accused to favor AND is a man. If you can't see the point then definitively YTA.\n\nAlso, being accademically skilled is important of course, but if your daughter struggled and you saw her doing her best (like: not bad grades out of being lazy), your duty as a parent was to support her confidence and help her finding her way. I would not give you a car.", "YTA - way to hold your son on a pedestal and let your daughter know that working towards her goals and failing for moment isn\u2019t enough for her dad.\n\nShe accused you of favouritism and misogyny?

You seriously couldn't help her out with getting a used car?", "YYA. Lana wasn't lazy, she struggled. She didn't do well because she's obviously just not academically inclined, not because she was a bad scholar. That doesn't mean she's less deserving.

Why a 3.5 gpa? I think that's pretty absurd. Why couldn't it be that if you graduated, you'd get a car? Or you'd split the cost and match what they saved? I'm sure you've always known that your daughter wasn't much of a scholar so of course it would seem to her that you're playing favorites because your son is bright and would most likely exceed a 3.5 and she wouldn't.\n\nYou said she had tutors all 4 years so she obviously tried. Some people are just more naturally gifted at school. And why do you mention the extra curriculars that your son did and mention that your daughter didn't?
