In this world where participation trophies are still the norm, you set out a goal for your kids. It was the same goal for both. It sounds like you provided academic support to your daughter, too. \n\nI also have high achieving kids, that I trained up to be that way. Where I live a car is minimal transportation. We have provided used cars for our kids, and I'm even sending one off with my son when he leaves for grad school in 2 weeks. I didn't put any stipulations on that. Also, in raising my boys to get their straight As, I didn't promise them anything for it. It was an expectation that they'd be successful. Everyone is different in how they parent. Perhaps it made a difference for your son. I reckon that he would have been successful regardless. \n\nThe only thing that I am deeply concerned about is that it looks like your daughter lost her mother while she was in high school, based on your later comments. This makes your empathy for her situation, and your need for meta-communication and communication even more important. \n\nIf my daughter said, \"what about my car?\" thinking a used one was coming her way, I think a discussion rather than a hard \"No.\" was in order. Clearly your extended family has a lot of sympathy for your daughter's situation.

I\u2019m inclined to think so because of your family\u2019s reaction. You might not have deliberately done it, you might not even be aware of it yourself, it might have been subconsciously, but reflect on your attitude with Lana and Roman over the last few years.

If the 'prize' was something smaller like a hundred quid then fair enough. But buying a car is a big step in a person's life.

While the bar may have been the same each needed to put in an incredibly different amount of work (ex. I had well above a 3.5 in high school too, did tons of extracurriculars, held numerous leadership positions, multiple ap/college level courses. I did not have to work particularly hard academically to do well and rarely studied. My younger sib didn't do well academically and had to spend hours studying just to pass. The amount of work and effort my siblings put in far exceed what I put in.) While life in general isn't fair, you have the opportunity to both acknowledge that and acknowledge the work your kid put in just to graduate (which you acknowledge wasn't a sure thing!) and help set your kid up for their future with a means of transportation.", "YTA, I'm afraid.  It sounds like you can afford to provide a used car to help Lana get started in life with no problem if you could have afforded a new car had her grades been more to your liking.  \n\nSchool is not as easy for some kids for all sorts of reasons.  To have insisted on such a high gpa was a standard that many children cannot manage.  Apparently Lana had difficulty with her classes but it also sounds like she worked hard at trying to do better.  It's indeed possible that she worked harder even than your son who is apparently quite bright and maybe school just came easier for him.  He IS your golden child but Lana is your child too and doesn't need to be treated as if she deserves nothing because, try as she did, she just could not rack up those A's. \n\nYou screwed up and need to figure a way to make this right.

Whatever her grades were at that time, you had 3 more years to help her do better academically, set herself up for success in the future, and remind her that the car was contingent on grades.  You say she struggled and needed tutoring, and are proud of her working so hard to pass, so the grades are not from lack of effort, she probably has some form of learning disability that went undiagnosed, compounded by shame that the same academic things just came natural to her older brother.    \n\n\nYou had 3 years between Ronan's car, and her graduation to manage her expectations of what you would be willing to do, and you didn't.  You knew graduation was approaching, and you didn't discuss options of what you would be willing to contribute towards a car.  So she feels betrayed, and hung out on her own to completely fend for herself.  You even described that with 3.5 gpa they would get a \"new car\", but she was looking at more modestly priced used cars, and with what money did you think she was going to buy one?  \n\n\nAs a parent, you **may** have done all you could to help her get good grades and they just didn't happen.  However, you definitely didn't do anything to cushion the blow that was coming to her.", "INFO\n\n1. What does Lana's mother say?\n2. Is it possible that Lana has an undiagnosed learning disability?

How would she get to community college without a car? Would you drive her there and back?", "YTA if your daughter put in the effort, it sounds like she did.\nLet me put it this way; if you promised them in middle school that you would give them a car if they could complete a 1 mile run at the age of 18, and your daughter then lost a leg in high school but still tried to train for the race, would you then still think it\u2019s fair that only your son got a car at 18, when your daughter tried her best to complete but just couldn\u2019t?", "This is a case of miscommunication. She assumed that getting good grades would get a new car but failing to get good grades would get a used car. \n\nThe adult who made the promise should have made it clear that the deal was graded gets car, no grades gets no car. \n\nBut YTA in any event.  \n\nEnjoy not understanding why she goes no contact with you in a few years.", "YTA, not because you didn't get her the car, but because you're teaching your children all the wrong lessons in life. As a parent, nothing should matter to you more than the work your children put into achieving whatever they achieve - even if it's a 2.0 GPA. You mentioned you're proud of the effort she's put in, but does she actually know it at all? And even if you think she does, how does she prove that to herself, when her brother might have put in the same amount of effort (albeit with different results) and gotten what she was told she wasn't 'good enough' to get? \n\nYour children should not be learning to achieve for the sake of achieving. They should be learning how to put their all into whatever they choose to do. Your daughter worked hard, and received nowhere near the consideration your son did. I know her results weren't satisfactory to YOU, but are you not going to reward her work AT ALL? I'm not saying you get her a brand new car, and neither is she! She was the one who decided to come to you with options for a used car! \n\nYour children will grow up knowing nothing matters more than what the end result is, no matter how hard or efficiently they work, and it will fuck them over later in life.", "ESH. You set a goal that your daughter couldn't achieve and never revisited it when it became clear that putting the same amount of work in as your son would not ever result in the same reward. A more appropriate thing to do would have been to have a discussion about how proud you were of her effort, and what alternative reward she would like since she was unlikely to get the car. She shouldn't have assumed she would be getting a reward for not achieving the goal without talking to you about it, nor misrepresented the situation to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son does seem to be the golden child, though. You may not notice your own favoritism, but you express it all the same. Your daughter clearly feels it, and probably doesn't understand why (his academic talent, not his gender); there may also be internalized sexism you don't notice but she does (everyone has socialized and unconscious bias--recognizing when you're giving in to them is hard, especially since you're not on the recieving end). At this point family therapy might be your best option, but of course it does require you all put in effort.\n\nAt the very least, instead of playing who's-the-A, your best strategy is to have a discussion where you explain that you are proud of her accomplishments and efforts, and you want to offer a reward that she has some say in, but you didn't like how she assumed she would be getting a reward she hadn't met the stipulations for (note: do NOT say 'hasn't earned' bc that's just creating a fight, as the connotations of 'earned' are complex and subjective). It may be the same reward but you change the requirements to be something she can achieve with reasonable effort (What is she actually good at? What are her long term goals?), or it might be a different reward of similar value that helps her accomplish her own life goals. Just remember to make some time to listen and let her vent, and be aware she may bring up grievances you weren't aware of--and some that may reflect her friends' experiences or her experiences with other adult men instead of her own with you. Rather than defending yourself immediately, try 'I haven't recognized that in myself before. I need some time to reflect and see if I can learn to identify those behaviors/attitudes when they happen unconsciously.' It shows you're at least listening, and prevents the conversation from becoming an argument ('I do NOT do that' rarely leads to productive conversation). You've clearly offered support to your daughter over time, with tutoring and therapy and other services, so it's clear you care about her and your relationship. Now it's time to look at how flexibility and individualized goals can improve it.", "YTA - you set a goal you knew only your son could accomplish. Seems like he is the golden child and your daughter is an after-thought.", "Yes, YTA. It's cool your daughter has some decent relatives who did the right thing.", "NTA.

But instead you actually just care about how book smart they are. Some kids can excel in school without even trying and some kids have to bust their asses just to do average. I'm sure your daughter has other skills that she excels at, so what you should be doing is encouraging your kid to work hard at finding what she is good at and what she enjoys and what will help her be an independent adult that makes good decisions.

I'm sure you've always known that your daughter wasn't much of a scholar so of course it would seem to her that you're playing favorites because your son is bright and would most likely exceed a 3.5 and she wouldn't.\n\nYou said she had tutors all 4 years so she obviously tried. Some people are just more naturally gifted at school. And why do you mention the extra curriculars that your son did and mention that your daughter didn't?

I failed nearly everything my first year of college. \n\nI reenrolled about a year ago, and am just finishing my bachelor\u2019s at 31. I found my niche and get As again, and I\u2019m going through to my Master\u2019s too. I can research and write well, but I still have no idea how to study raw information.", "I was the same way, and then in middle school and high school really, really struggled.

All my honors courses were bumped up a letter grade. I was always shit at getting my homework done and yet I had a 3.79.", "Seriously. I have two friends who both just had the teachers treat them like they were morons. One of them actually had a teacher tell her how stupid she was and it ended up putting her off college for a while. The other friend spent several years struggling in JC.  She found it later that she's severely dyslexic. The other friend had ADHD.  The dyslexic friend currently holds a PhD in a hard science during which time she earned herself a prestigious fellowship. The one with ADHD has a masters in a hard science and is considering her PhD still. \n\n\nBoth completely brilliant, both treated as if they were just idiots, and both with learning disabilities diagnosed later in life.", "> What if she has an undiagnosed learning disability? \n\nI think that's very likely if she struggled this much.", "My son is 2e with asd, adhd and dysgraphia. His grades were not good, especially in ELA, because he refused work or didn\u2019t finish work. He simply couldn\u2019t write fast enough and he gave up. \n\nTook us time to get a diagnosis but he made all As this year accommodations like speech to text. I know he would have continued to struggle without it, despite being gifted. I was beyond thrilled when he volunteered this year to read his paper to the class. He had never done it before. \n\nI can\u2019t stand people like OP who only reward results and not the effort.", "Yeah, I bet it\u2019s an undiagnosed learning disability. You don\u2019t try that hard and barely scrap by for no reason. I think that might be why ZERO people are talking to him.", "I was gonna say, my grades were either 90's or 60s, and usually the latter. Fun fact, I was diagnosis with adhd after getting out of highschool. I always lament about if people had paid attention and I had got diagnosed earlier in life I would've done better in school. Oh well though.", "With the pandemic so many kids went undiagnosed or there were delays in diagnosis.", "I have a sibling with dyscalculia and it\u2019s kind of astonishing how few people have heard of it.", "Sounds like the son is gifted and the daughter probably worked *harder* than he did.", "The scholarship could be from an outside source. \n\nAlso Ivies now often have graduated % of contributions.

Also working from home in zoom calls, little motivation, dwindling social life, depression and also very likely actually getting sick with covid a couple of times. \n\nOP will probably eventually say well she has ADHD, also she got hit by covid bad and had brain fog for 18 months... but didn't hit that 3.5gpa so fuck her right.", "Add to that the struggle a lot of kids that age developed with depression and isolation it\u2019s possible all she was able to do was just barely pass. I\u2019ve got a buddy that started freshmen year straight A\u2019s her whole life. Pandemic hit her end of freshmen. Spent all sophomore through first half of senior year online. She barely passed.

He literally told her it doesn't matter how hard you work, if you can't overcome your actual limitations you'll never accomplish anything. YTA AND you taught your child a horrible life lesson. Congrats", "This is so true, my brother-in-law is very academically inclined, especially in math. He breezed thru school, went to college for his BA & Masters hardly breaking a sweat. My wife struggled in school was placed in Special Education, Dropped out, had to go back and redo everything from 9th grade up because her transcripts wouldn't be useful to get into college. She did that with lots of tutoring, then got to college and absolutely rocked it. One C and the balance A's now has her masters. Sometimes different environments can also help a person find their footing.", "I gotta say, a lot of the time people who aren't academic geniuses are working harder than those who are. Because of some learning conditions I tend to learn faster than the average person and I often felt like an impostor for getting better results than classmates that were trying really hard while I went well in tests just going with the flow. I struggled in school but because I had really bad anxiety and it would get worse during exams. Everyone has their struggles and looking at them just for the results is one of the dumbest things our schooling system does. If you are below average on learning capacity but with average scores, you are working really hard. If you are above average with average scores, you might not be trying that much.", "Not necessarily. A lot of places don\u2019t have weighted GPAs.", "Gotcha covered.", "I struggled through math my whole life. For four years, I came to school early, stayed late, got tutored during lunch, and even took tutoring materials and extra credit assignments home on weekends and holidays. I barely scraped by with an A. ( I had a 96 or better in every other class I took). Even now, I have a hard time with numbers. I forget them, transpose digits or forget how to do \u201csimple\u201d things like percentages constantly. During the pandemic, I used to do my kids\u2019 math work before they got the assignments, so I could write every step down in case they needed help. And I would ask one of my teacher friends to check it. Last year, I was watching The Challenge, and one of the competitors mentioned that she had dyscalculia. I\u2019m 46, and I had no idea that I could possibly have struggled with an actual learning disability all along. If ONE TEACHER had thought that maybe it was a little bit strange that a normally decent student had such a hard time, my life would have been so much easier.", "Oh my gosh!  This reminds me of my favorite autocorrect fail.  This has been around a decade ago now, I think.  My best friend developed a blood clotting disorder after she gave birth to her daughter. She had surgery, and I was going to visit her in the hospital.  Hospital food isn\u2019t great, so I texted her before I left work to see if she wanted me to pick something up for her.  Autocorrect changed \u201clemonade\u201d to \u201clesbian.\u201d  I told her I wasn\u2019t sure I could pick one of those up for her at Fazoli\u2019s.", "Reddit:\n\n*And I love you, Random Citizen!*", "My therapist and psychiatrist", "Autocorrect on mine changes St. Valentines day to St. Palestine Day  - that's what it's been known as for the last 6 years :)", "People cover their mouth for panini, right?!", "My name is from a different culture, but autocorrect likes to change it to Jacobi, Herring, etc.", "Yes!  It isnt fair to give a child a goal they cant achieve. \n\nMy daughter had a 4.2 gpa in hs but even with 2 years of tudoring and tons of studying, she couldnt get better than a 25 on the ACT.  My son got a 26 on the ACT in the 8th grade with 0 prep. She put in so much effort to get better and her brother beat her score without trying.  Is he more deserving?", "Yeah, dad is probably like Ronan and takes for granted how \"easy\" that 3.5 is to earn. School must be easy for his son, otherwise he'd not have time for sports, debate club, and volunteering. It's possible that Lana was spending an equal amount of time between studying, tutoring, and (presumably, considering dad assumed she wanted to buy a car herself) work.\n\nBear in mind, he didn't say no extracurriculars, just much less. Ronan's obviously his favorite, because he can recount every accomplishment while undercutting his daughter (if he even remembers her extracurriculars, he could be entirely disinterested because she isn't the golden child).\n\nIs it misogyny? I don't think so, otherwise he'd have dismissed her from the start, but he clearly has a favorite child.", "And the comment 'its a miracle she passed at all' such a terrible father", "And Ronan. Ronan is ETA.", "The thing that makes me worry that this situation isn't salvageable is that the car's already purchased. There's no way to fix the mistake now that looks like anything but damage control. He can reimburse his family members (who probably will refuse to take the money) and then *technically* he sort of bought the car? But that won't fly. The lasting memory his daughter will have is that he did a cruel thing and then could not be moved to change his mind, not by her, not by his family, not by anyone...until maybe a bunch of Redditors he'd never met guilt-tripped him into seeing his error.\n\nGonna need a loooooot of therapy to fix this, and I don't think this guy is the type to believe in therapy.", "Malice.

Punishing someone for grades while acknowledging that she tried extremely hard and graduated doesn\u2019t sit right with me. It wasn\u2019t a lack of trying, and there were massive factors at play (how roughly put together most e-learning was during the pandemic, lack of possible extra curriculars) like it really does come across that she\u2019s simply not the favourite", "I wouldn't be surprised if she was struggling academically, at least in part, because she was also dealing with a misogynistic AH father who made her feel inadequate.", "\u2764\ufe0f.
