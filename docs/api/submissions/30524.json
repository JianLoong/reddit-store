I answered that she will still not be able to smoke in there irrespective if she pays. \nI went to my sister and asked her to speak to her friend. My sister did that and few moments later I heard the room door slam. Upon enquiry the friend acted pissed, saying that its her holiday and she'll do what she likes. I instructed her to pack her bags and go. My sister decided to leave with her friend and the men after we got into some words. She also smoked weed with them and didn't see the problem I was experiencing. She said I was overreacting.
