On the invitation it was stated that a +1 was allowed. I've been single for most of the time but one month ago I got with a girl, Chrissy (28f) who I've known for years. Chrissy used to date Josh on and off in high school and early college until josh broke off things with her and got with Emily. Due to different circumstances, josh doesn't even want to hear about chrissy. I thought that after so many years have passed and we've all matured and grown there would be no issues. He hasn't talked to her in 7 years but I've kept in minimal contact to the point we reconnected as friends few months ago and then we started dating.\n\nAssuming there was no issue since chrissy seemed chill with being invited as my plus one, I brought her. I didn't think I'd have to notify anyone for this.\n\nEmily and josh didn't see her at first but Emily spotted chrissy once the ceremony was over and she froze. I could tell she was mad but was trying to play it cool because of the wedding. I knew there it would be an issue. Before I even arrived at the reception venue josh called me while I was parking and told me what the hell was I thinking and that chrissy needs to go home now. I tried to reason with him saying I can't just send chrissy home because her house is more than an hour drive from the venue. I tried to reason with him explaining how it's been 7 years, if he's mature and really over her he'll be okay with me bringing her. After all he just got married, he can't be mad I brought his ex from over 7 years ago. He started screaming at me about how \"IT'S THE PRINCIPLE YOU AH, THE PRINCIPLE. I'M OVER HER OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST BRING HER AROUND. IT'S THE PRINCIPLE. EMILY IS UPSET BECAUSE OF YOU AND HER.. SEND HER HOME NOW\".\n\nI ended up calling chrissy an uber I which I paid for. Chrissy was mad at me for giving up so easily and also thinks I'm a weak ah.", "created_utc": 1695638476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16roiqj/aita_for_bringing_my_new_gf_to_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 1114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the invitation it was stated that a +1 was allowed. I've been single for most of the time but one month ago I got with a girl, Chrissy (28f) who I've known for years. Chrissy used to date Josh on and off in high school and early college until josh broke off things with her and got with Emily. Due to different circumstances, josh doesn't even want to hear about chrissy. I thought that after so many years have passed and we've all matured and grown there would be no issues. He hasn't talked to her in 7 years but I've kept in minimal contact to the point we reconnected as friends few months ago and then we started dating.\n\nAssuming there was no issue since chrissy seemed chill with being invited as my plus one, I brought her. I didn't think I'd have to notify anyone for this.\n\nEmily and josh didn't see her at first but Emily spotted chrissy once the ceremony was over and she froze. I could tell she was mad but was trying to play it cool because of the wedding. I knew there it would be an issue. Before I even arrived at the reception venue josh called me while I was parking and told me what the hell was I thinking and that chrissy needs to go home now. I tried to reason with him saying I can't just send chrissy home because her house is more than an hour drive from the venue. I tried to reason with him explaining how it's been 7 years, if he's mature and really over her he'll be okay with me bringing her. After all he just got married, he can't be mad I brought his ex from over 7 years ago. He started screaming at me about how \"IT'S THE PRINCIPLE YOU AH, THE PRINCIPLE. I'M OVER HER OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST BRING HER AROUND. IT'S THE PRINCIPLE. EMILY IS UPSET BECAUSE OF YOU AND HER.. SEND HER HOME NOW\".\n\nI ended up calling chrissy an uber I which I paid for. Chrissy was mad at me for giving up so easily and also thinks I'm a weak ah.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Imagine it from her perspective-- she's invited to a wedding, maybe she asks if OP is sure Josh is cool with it, OP is like yeah yeah it's fine, then after the ceremony OP is like actually he's not cool with it, you gotta leave now but I'm gonna stay. That's red flags all over OP, but I imagine Chrissy is like wtf he just kicked me out mid wedding and didn't even stand up for me or leave with me.\n\nBut also she could be conniving, it's speculation either way.", "I just think it's odd that you didn't think to bring this up.

Assuming you're trying to act in good faith but, are just not self-aware enough about how you missteped, I'd recommend just reaching out to him, apologising and attempting to explain where you were coming from.

You just need to stop defending yourself on this one.  Suck it up and apologize for your thoughtlessness and hope your friend and his new wife forgive you for doing something idiotic.  Own it.  Hopefully they forgive you, but doubling down and trying to get people to agree with you in this case is just going to piss everyone off.  Chrissy should have known better too if she knew to whoms wedding she was going.  If you are this oblivious (and I have many friends that are, so not a great deal of judgement), then Chrissy is not going to be a good partner for you since she didn\u2019t knock some sense into you or question if this was a good idea prior if she knew.", "Why would you assume that?

The fact that his wife had such a reaction is pretty immature as well. It\u2019s very telling that both the bride and groom freaked out and didn\u2019t simply move on and try to enjoy their wedding.

As a longtime single person, I generally decline the +1, if offered, when I'm going to an event where I already know a lot of people (for instance, if it's a college friend's wedding where there will be a lot of people from college I know), but have taken friends to weddings where I was only going to know one or two people there.\n\n\\*Within reason.

Tell, not fucking yell like a child, your friend that he should have let you know before bringing her, as its his wedding and he has a right to know who's showing up, especially if its an ex girlfriend so he can be prepared to see that as that surprise can be shocking. But at the end of the day, there are more than enough people at a wedding. Why not just ignore that one person that's only there to be with your friend, for the sole purpose of being happy and enjoying supporting your marriage together?", "See now, that makes you a decent person!", "That would be so awkward to see the living embodiment of the person your husband told you stories about at your wedding \ud83d\udc80", "lmao ya'll are insane   \n\n\nare you all twelve years old", "Who tf would agree to that? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d Especially an ex you haven't seen or spoken to in seven years??", "Of course she knew about the wedding!! Do you know any women!?!?", "I'm not sure I trust that Emily was jealous of Chrissy. It is entirely possible, but Josh sounds like he was very much done with Chrissy. I'm curious who was the source about Emily being jealous of Chrissy. If she was jealous, what did Chrissy do?\n\nI suspect Chrissy was jealous of Emily.", "That's my guess, too! I bet there's a whole storyline about Chrissy's behavior that he's leaving out.", "I\u2019ve seen plus one listed but once you RSVP, that no longer applies. If you RSVP as a single person, you are no longer allowed a guest because it will mess up the numbers for catering", "Exactly what I was thinking, especially getting mad that he gave up easily", "Holy yikes. I'm so beyond happy I went on to have a life after high school and am not stuck in the same old drama with the same old people.", "Check OPs comments\u2026 \u2018Emily despises Chrissy\u2019 and Chrissy may have done something bad  [to emily] but I don\u2019t know what because Josh never told me.  So yeah- Chrissy gets a side eye from me as not sure she was so innocent in accepting the plus 1.. AND  then for still wanting to go to the reception even after groom made it abundantly clear that neither he nor the bride wanted her there? Thats not innocent, there\u2019s not reading a room and then being an Ah. \n\nSo yeah, OP took massive advantage of the plus one to invite someone he knew wouldn\u2019t be welcome and didn\u2019t check first, but chrissy aint in the clear", "If Emily knew her on sight seven years later there was not a clean break in the past. I couldn\u2019t pick my SO\u2019s ex out of a lineup, especially ones he hasn\u2019t spoken to since they broke up.", "I suspect there was more to the story than \" they were on and off in high school\". OP either isn't privy to the details or has conveniently left them out of his story. But Chrissy being pissed  tells me she DOES remember , and I'll bet she really wanted to be the thorn in the couple's  side", "Her comments about him being weak seem to me she likes to start shit and was enjoying the drama. The bride and groom made it clear they don\u2019t want you there, stop fighting for it.", "I saw those comments after!  The more he explains it, the worse it gets \ud83d\ude06", "The groom is not your friend, you have not treated them as a friend, you have belittled and ignored his feelings. He told you that Chrissy did something to him and Erica that made it so he doesn't want anything to do with her, doesn't even want yo hear about her and you thought he would be OK with her at his wedding.\n\n\nThe only immature person he is you, for ignoring and dismissing someone else's feelings and boundaries because you want to get laid. You are a moron, doesn't matter of it was 10 years ago or 10 mins ago if someone tells you they don't want anything to do with someone the very least you can do is not bring that person to their wedding. I don't even care if they split amicably no one wants an ex at their wedding, the ONLY exceptions are of they are literally still friends and the couple invites them themselves.\n\nEven if you really thought it was OK, I cannot imagine not having any common sense enough to just check with the bride and groom first. WTf is wrong with you?  He's right it is the principle,  you massive jacka**, like seiously poor Emily, you almost ruined this girl's special day because you couldn't pull your head out of your a** long enough to think. \n\nCongrats though, you gained a girlfriend and probably lost a friend.  You've been dating this girl for all of 5 mins and decided that was worth screwing over a friend. YTA, geez the lack of common sense, are you 28 or 18 because there no fucking way. \n\nAlso your comments that you don't believe your friend of years saying why he doesn't want to deal with Chrissy, but you take Chrissy a mild acquaintance and new gf of 5 mins, word over his is telling.", "Imagine being this delusional believing he\u2019s right to take the groom\u2019s ex to his weeding. No one cares if she is your \u201cpartner\u201d (of only 1 month), before that she is the groom\u2019s ex. And you don\u2019t believe Chrissy made something bad in the past for what? You\u2019re really choosing some chick you just meet over you friend of years and years?! But, you know, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t think Josh will want you around anymore. I wouldn\u2019t.", "Not to a fucking wedding!", ">Am I supposed to never bring chrissy ever around?\n\nYes. Find a new friend.", "Honestly if she were just any other woman you were dating recently, that'd be fine - although you should still ask if you can bring her. But this particular woman you knew full well that it would be an issue.", "Was the wedding the first event you tried to bring Chrissy too? Did Josh or any of your friends even know you were dating her?", "Oh, honey.\n\nJosh and Emily are so done with you.  \n\nPretty sure Chrissy is done with you, too.", "Don't worry, I'm sure he won't be your friend for long.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need to worry about that\u2026.", "You're not supposed to date you're friend's ex, specially if she did something shady to the (now) bride.", "You're seriously so excited you finally have a girlfriend that you're going to fuck off everyone else. Good job.", "Calling a gf of one month your \"partner\" is a bit fast there bud.", "You've got to understand how bringing her to a chill Thursday night hang out is miles different than bringing her to her ex's wedding. Laid back regular night vs a once in a lifetime event are not comparable.", "Yeah. I have to disagree that she was jealous. Why? Because Chrissy made a super asshole move in saying that her bf of a  oriole of months \u201cfight\u201d for her. And his failure to do so to her standards (how did he not, arguing with the groom on maturity and how HE is right, on his fucking wedding day) made him weak in her opinion. \n\nSounds like the only problem anyone has with Chrissy is purely a Chrissy is an entitled dramamonger.", "Simple answer for you because you DON'T seem to be getting it\n\nYou assumed something. You were wrong. You made a day that's supposed to be about the bride and groom all about yourself\n\nYTA\n\nIt's THAT simple. Accept it", "oh buddy...", "It doesn't matter if you believe C did something to E. Something happened that made E to never see her again. Dang, your skull is thick.", "Honey. Wow. How on Earth did you arrive at the conclusion this was a good idea? Really, truly, I'd love to know your thought process, because this was a catastrophically bad plan.", "Wow, it sounds like it was super thoughtful of you to drag ths unhinged bag of drama to HIS WEDDING.\n\nYTA x 100", "So the bride despises her and you brought her anyways? You\u2019re a moron. And YTA", "Do you think everything is about you and fall to online scammers daily? This is the vibe you give.", "Let\u2019s make some popcorn and watch how long Chrissy stays with OP now that the wedding is over and shit has been properly stirred", "Bingo. Reconnecting \"a few months ago\" with her very, very single friend plus her being upset with OP for giving up before she got her fill of enjoyment from the drama? These all but confirm it. A normal, non-AH would not be so content to be the reason a wedding is being disrupted. She wanted it, and used OP to get it. My money is on her discovering an excuse to break things off now that she finished flexing on her ex.\n\nYTA for OP for knowing very well his friend didn't have good feelings surrounding this person, then dating her and bringing her to the wedding anyway. And YTA big time to his soon-to-be-ex-gf.", "He does not sound too bright", "It gets worse of you check OPs comments - \u2018Emily despises Chrissy\u2019 and Chrissy may have done something bad but josh never told him full story.  They both knew full well she wouldn\u2019t be welcome, or are equally nuts", "Exactly! When your friend says \u201cnever talk to me about that person,\u201d that is not unspoken permission to invite the person to your friend\u2019s wedding.", "That is why he didn't clear it beforehand. Better to apologize later than be told \"no\" before. Now he knows it doesn't fly with weddings.", "Because they're adults?", "It\u2019s also suspicious Chrissy started dating OP a month ago. Just in time to go to her ex\u2019s wedding.", "I have this Ex too.... I would be furious if I saw him in my city (I moved across the country to get away from him), let alone at my wedding.", "Exactly! He is over the \"in love\" part, but the unpleasant break up part is not something he's interested in being reminded of at his wedding.", "Michigander here, and that\u2019s a fact!!", "What\u2019s the debate here? He was invited with a plus 1, he turned up with a plus 1, and so at some point presumably rsvp\u2019d with a plus one?    If he rsvp\u2019d for one, and turned up with two then yeah sure he gets another asshole. A plus one asshole if  you like.   But from all the above- and no matter how OP described it in the title-  I don\u2019t think the issue is at all about him bringing his new GF,  the issue is in who the new gf is to bride and groom", "I don\u2019t understand why people like this ask if they\u2019re AH, get everyone telling him he is, still fights it with semantics that don\u2019t matter, would NEVER let anyone do this to himself, and after being told 500+ times WHY he\u2019s an asshole\u2026 just like wants to continue to look stupid.", "lol for real. did you piss in their cheerios this morning? wtf", "No no it's clearly because he didn't stand up for her, definitely not because the wedding is over and she has no use for him /s", "Cause they're adults who still share the same friend group? He ABSOLUTELY should have asked first.", "Yea I could tell there was something there. The frozen in tracks is more than just an ex of 7 years ago showing up.", "ok, this definitely changes my mind. At first I thought, \"come on now, everyone grow up. Who cares if your buddy is dating someone you dated a long time ago\"...maybe because I'm in my mid 50s and I have a low tolerance for drama, but knowing the bride despises the plus 1, uhhhhh....yeah. WTF dude. no!!!!! leave her home!", "That's what I was thinking, probably a short time of overlap and Emily used to see Chrissy as a threat. What a shitshow", "Nope. Adults don\u2019t spring each others exes on them during important moments. \n\nAdults have conversations like \u201cI got back in contact with Chrissy and we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a while now. I know things ended awkwardly for you guys, so I wanted to check if you were okay with me bringing her as my +1 to the wedding.\u201d", "I\u2019m less worried about that part. He could have RSVP\u2019d with a plus 1 even when he was single, figuring he\u2019d find somebody to bring.", "That had me voting that OP is TA even without all the baggage. A month before the wedding, he decides he's going to bring a plus one and not tell anybody? Has he never been to a wedding before?", "Oh? So of course you\u2019ve previously told your friend you\u2019re dating Chrissy? Since it\u2019s been \u201calmost a decade\u201d and he should be over it?  Or you\u2019ve *never* mentioned you\u2019re dating his ex because he made it clear he doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about her? Which would lead any non-moron to believe it would NOT be cool to take her to his wedding?\n\nThe answer to his question will determine whether you\u2019re truly stupid and Chrissy\u2019s patsy to attend her ex\u2019s wedding in some twisted plot, or whether you\u2019re a massive AH who just wanted to stir the pot on your friends very important day.", "It isn\u2019t for you to decide when someone is over something. You have no idea what the entire story is. You knew damn well it was a bad idea because any good friend would have asked before bringing an ex to a wedding. You decided to avoid asking so you could bring her and then act like you did nothing wrong. You would think someone pushing 30 would have the common sense to see what a stupid decision this was.", "But you don't know what happend. So how could you consider what would be enough time to forgive and forget?", "You are clueless and YTA. As it Chrissy for how she responded. \n\nI dated an ex\u2019s best friend 20 years after we had dated and he still made sure it was OK if we dated. There is no time limit.", "No one is this naive.  You just love drama.  \n\nYou do not ever bring anyone with a negative past with the bride or groom to their wedding.  Period.  It doesn't matter if 50 years passed.  \n\nYou just love stirring the pot.  \n\nWelp don't worry about it going forward because you're getting cut off by those friends.  They definitely aren't going to have you around anymore.", "You are utterly clueless - sorry to say- but you knew the groom didn\u2019t even want to talk about her and you bring her TO THE WEDDING?! Hope when you get married someone sabotages you like this and tries to be all \u201cgrow past it\u201d smugness.", "How is it petty and insecure if you don't even know what happened?  \n\nYou brought someone who the bride despised last you heard to the bride's wedding.  You're a total doofus.", "Stop playing your carelessness off as \u201cmaturity\u201d. You didn\u2019t clear it with Josh & Emily, probably on purpose, just so you cop out like this. You want us to believe you\u2019re so above this immature in-fighting while at the same time lacking basic foresight. Lol, lmao even. YTA.", "Yeah it\u2019s been 3 years since my ex made me homeless and I still want nothing to do with her", "You're a fuckin idiot dude.  Not an asshole.  A fuckin moron", "Right like I feel like we were even saying the same thing lmao like I'm so confused", "Do they share the same friend group? OP said he\u2019d been low key in contact with her over the years. That doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019ve been hanging out in the same social circle all this time.", "He split up with her to go with his current partner and you think it's okay to take her to his wedding \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 he absolutely shouldn't have asked cause nobody would be that stupid to take a friends ex to his wedding,", "That's the only reason I know the definition, the Local H song was popular when I was in high school.", "Lol, that is what my friend and I thought of. They had minimal contact but somehow right before the wedding they start dating Sounds suspect. Her comment about OP being WEAK  as if he should have fought the bride and groom for her right to be there is even more suspect. Although OP sounds like an idiot considering they seem unable to comprehend why this was a stupid idea and why they are in the wrong.\n\nOP YTA and potentially pat", "OP is being denser than a whole cake made with a cup of protein powder and 17 eggs.", "If your friends drop people from their friend group over breakups, that's really unfortunate. The adults I know stay on good terms with their exes. They remain friends, do business together and celebrate each other's milestones. And that includes weddings and birthdays. I've met several girls my husband used to date at parties and they've all been lovely! And same goes for him with guys I used to date.", "Scott Lucas is my cousin. Love seeing them mentioned in the wild."]}
