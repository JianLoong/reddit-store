It's not unfair since you still buy equal gifts, etc, and the switch is your property- you don't have to share it with anyone especially one who destroys things often.  I hope you and Eliza continue to have a close relationship, as she gets older especially in her teens she'll likely need a good aunt like you to talk to!", "NTA - You're allowed to have favorites, even parents secretly have favorites.\n\nBuying gifts for the brother on his sister's birthday so he doesn't throw a tantrum... yikes that kid is going to be a monster later on in life with that level of enabling.", "NTA someone needs to pay attention to her!", "NTA. Their ages are so different that it makes sense having seperate rules for them, and does not openly suggest favoritm on your part. It is normal to let a 9 year old play with something and say no to a 4 year old. I do not think there is much to find fault with your actions, even if favoritm was an issue.", "You are not allowed to have favorite children or grandchildren\nYou are absolutely allowed to have favorite nieces and nephews\n\nNTA", "NTA. Assuming that you're still kind to your nephew, it's ok to connect more with your niece. It's good for her to have someone she can talk to and spend time with. I would maybe also suggest that you keep an eye on your feelings about your nephew. If a 4 year old has behavioral issues it's not because they're a bad kid. It's important to remember that he is struggling too. You don't have to let him walk all over you or let him break your switch, obviously.", "NTA - now as the kid ages and (hopefully) tempers out - I am sure you will adjust.  \n\nSounds like you are a great Aunt. If you were mean to the younger or something - than yeah. But it sounds like all you are doing is being kind.  \n\n4 year olds are tough- even if they act decent, they are just tiny bowling balls with no filter. Bit crazy. Try not to hold the kids behavior against him as its usually a sign of parenting at that age. Although some kids are just more wild and have to be raised a bit differently.", ">My mom says I\u2019m an asshole for favoring my nephew because he will have self esteem issues.\n\nTell your mom and the rest of the lot that maybe Eliza will have self esteem issue because they are all ignoring her! Charlie's 4 and already blaming his bad behavior on Eliza? That's pretty damn telling. \n\nNTA at all. Keep being a good aunt to Eliza. Seems like she needs someone to be in her corner.", "nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's in a completely different stage of life from a preschooler - much easier to talk to, hang out with or babysit. It's totally natural to enjoy hanging out with her more and to let her do different things to her brother.\n\nOP just needs to make sure she doesn't hold her nephew's current state of rowdy, boisterous little kid against him as he grows up and becomes more adult. He'll be fun to hang out with too, one day.", "I understand that. It is rarely the fault of the child but most often the fault of the parents. His parents don\u2019t really put any expectations on him. They work long hours and are too tired to keep him under control when they get home", "I know. His parents are very busy people who are tired at the end of the day. Once he levels out I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along better.", "Yeah- 4 year olds can be difficult for parents to hang with all day. Sounds like he is a mix of a typical boy who probably has a few too few boundaries. So he acts a little wild.    \n\nStick with what you are doing and dont make it about the boy- just say you are trying to be the best Aunt to a young lady as you can be!\n\ngood luck"]}
