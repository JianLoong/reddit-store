It's not unfair since you still buy equal gifts, etc, and the switch is your property- you don't have to share it with anyone especially one who destroys things often.  I hope you and Eliza continue to have a close relationship, as she gets older especially in her teens she'll likely need a good aunt like you to talk to!", "NTA - You're allowed to have favorites, even parents secretly have favorites.\n\nBuying gifts for the brother on his sister's birthday so he doesn't throw a tantrum... yikes that kid is going to be a monster later on in life with that level of enabling.", "NTA someone needs to pay attention to her!", "NTA. Their ages are so different that it makes sense having seperate rules for them, and does not openly suggest favoritm on your part. It is normal to let a 9 year old play with something and say no to a 4 year old. I do not think there is much to find fault with your actions, even if favoritm was an issue.", "You are not allowed to have favorite children or grandchildren\nYou are absolutely allowed to have favorite nieces and nephews\n\nNTA", "NTA. Assuming that you're still kind to your nephew, it's ok to connect more with your niece. It's good for her to have someone she can talk to and spend time with. I would maybe also suggest that you keep an eye on your feelings about your nephew. If a 4 year old has behavioral issues it's not because they're a bad kid. It's important to remember that he is struggling too. You don't have to let him walk all over you or let him break your switch, obviously.", "NTA - now as the kid ages and (hopefully) tempers out - I am sure you will adjust.  \n\nSounds like you are a great Aunt. If you were mean to the younger or something - than yeah. But it sounds like all you are doing is being kind.  \n\n4 year olds are tough- even if they act decent, they are just tiny bowling balls with no filter. Bit crazy. Try not to hold the kids behavior against him as its usually a sign of parenting at that age. Although some kids are just more wild and have to be raised a bit differently.", ">My mom says I\u2019m an asshole for favoring my nephew because he will have self esteem issues.\n\nTell your mom and the rest of the lot that maybe Eliza will have self esteem issue because they are all ignoring her! Charlie's 4 and already blaming his bad behavior on Eliza? That's pretty damn telling. \n\nNTA at all. Keep being a good aunt to Eliza.

Charlie is only four, he may grow on you a bit when he's older.", "Thank you for paying attention to your niece.  She seems to have be forgotten by everyone else.\n\nWith the Switch, Charlie is going to break and I bet your sister would blame you and not replace it.  Until Charlie can handle  not breaking stuff, he shouldn't have access to it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. A 4 year old is kinda expected to be the loud, obnoxious center of attention. A 9 year old is more grown up and gets more privileges and responsibility. It's okay to enjoy spending time with your niece.", "I was going to say this, Eliza is much more mature because she's 5 years older. She's in a completely different stage of life from a preschooler - much easier to talk to, hang out with or babysit. It's totally natural to enjoy hanging out with her more and to let her do different things to her brother.\n\nOP just needs to make sure she doesn't hold her nephew's current state of rowdy, boisterous little kid against him as he grows up and becomes more adult. He'll be fun to hang out with too, one day.", "I understand that. It is rarely the fault of the child but most often the fault of the parents. His parents don\u2019t really put any expectations on him. They work long hours and are too tired to keep him under control when they get home", "I know. His parents are very busy people who are tired at the end of the day. Once he levels out I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along better.", "Yeah- 4 year olds can be difficult for parents to hang with all day. Sounds like he is a mix of a typical boy who probably has a few too few boundaries. So he acts a little wild.    \n\nStick with what you are doing and dont make it about the boy- just say you are trying to be the best Aunt to a young lady as you can be!\n\ngood luck", "ESH I understand that you think you're somehow leveling the playing field but this could absolutely backfire. Her brother is still very young and it's natural that younger kids have a harder time controlling themselves and they definitely take more attention to care for, that's normal. Just be sure you aren't so focused on Eliza that you're doing exactly what you accuse everyone else of doing!", "NTA\n\nTell your mom as soon as she starts saying that to your sister about Eliza, maybe something will change.

I don't think it's blatant favoritism vs reality about the age range and maturity level of your niblings.    \nI too would let older niblings have more freedom if they show more responsibility.      \nAnd nobody wants to spend extra time with a spoiled brat.", "NTA truth everyone has a favorite or one they are closer too it\u2019s just not something people admit.", "NTA. Your mom can take it up with the parents who are treating their children unequally.", "This, no one knows but secretly my niece is my favorite. She\u2019s not as emotional as my nephew and sometimes it\u2019s hard to deal with a kid who\u2019s emotional all the time when you\u2019re an autistic adult who can\u2019t handle loud noises.", "NTA \n\nAs someone who\u2019s sister ALWAYS had to have a gift on my birthday I absolutely loved my aunt most who only got me a gift and told my sister that it was my day and not hers. It made me feel like I wasn\u2019t crazy and that some people definitely saw things the way I did and that I was allowed to have things for myself.", "NTA for any of this. You're giving Eliza a space away from her brother who really sounds like he's a bit of a handful. \n\nRe: not giving the Switch to a four year old who throws things - this is the same way I might trust a 9 year old with one of my guitars because they have the capacity to understand that they are fragile and expensive, but if a four year old was coming over I'd put them behind a locked door.", ">My mom says I\u2019m an asshole for favoring my [niece] because he will have self esteem issues\n\nThis is exact the opposite of how it works. The more you neglect a child the more issues they have later on in life.", "NTA", "I have three cousins. Ones around Eliza\u2019s age and the other two are around Charlie\u2019s age. I love all of them a lot, of course I do! But the oldest one can sit down, she can have conversations with me, she can help her sisters, I can teach her things, like harder arts and crafts and musical instruments, and she wants to learn, and she can learn. It takes significantly less energy to spend time with her than with her younger sisters because she\u2019s almost 10 and just acts that age. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m three years the middle child will be easier to spend time with, the eldest will be in her early teen years and the youngest will still be very young!", "- However, everyone else in his life favors him over his sister, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue.\n\nWhy?  Is it because he\u2019s younger or because he\u2019s a boy?  There doesn\u2019t seem to be any other redeeming qualities for this lousy kid. \n\nThanks for standing up for that poor girl in the face of your family\u2019s rampant idiocy. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all", "Sounds like that kid is already a monster.\n\nNTA good for op seeing the neice needs the attention and giving her the one on one she needs and deserves", "Because he is younger and requires more supervision due to him being hyper and rambunctious", "> He'll be fun to hang out with too, one day.\n\nMaybe. He's currently being given gifts at his sister's birthday party so he doesn't throw a fit over not being the center of attention, which doesn't bode well for how much fun he'll be to hang out with at any point in his life in his future. It's not his fault; he's four. His parents are really not setting him up for success here."]}
