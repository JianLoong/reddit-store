That's a whole different story. \n\nYou're a prude... 20 and finding it \"disgusting\"... my god. I use to hear my parents, and I rolled my eyes for sure, but even back in the 90s, I'd still just look for my trusty Walkman and put on some tunes, to which I'd fall asleep on the music anyways.

In which case YTA since you don't even know if you'd have heard it or not and just went off like 'btw don't you guys dare have sex'. Now if you already heard them and then approached your mom about it and she told you to get over it, then I'd vote an ESH. There are solutions which don't involve an argument. Your mom would have also dismissed your discomfort which is not good. \n\nAlso, I have to give you unofficial YTA points because like... You told you mom that them having sex is 'disturbing and disgusting'? Like... What the fuck? People having sex is neither of those. They must have done it for you to exist, and obviously in a stable married relationship they'd have done it more than just to have you. It's a bonding thing. And I'm not saying that you cannot have a boundary of 'well I don't want to hear it going on', that's totally fair and normal. But to think of your parents having sex in general as disgusting and disturbing is just so disrespectful to me. I mean why? Because they're older? Because they're parents? Because they're not what one may call 'young and hot' anymore? Sex is normal.
