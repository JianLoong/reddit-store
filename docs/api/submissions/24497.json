That's a whole different story. \n\nYou're a prude... 20 and finding it \"disgusting\"... my god. I use to hear my parents, and I rolled my eyes for sure, but even back in the 90s, I'd still just look for my trusty Walkman and put on some tunes, to which I'd fall asleep on the music anyways.

In which case YTA since you don't even know if you'd have heard it or not and just went off like 'btw don't you guys dare have sex'. Now if you already heard them and then approached your mom about it and she told you to get over it, then I'd vote an ESH. There are solutions which don't involve an argument. Your mom would have also dismissed your discomfort which is not good. \n\nAlso, I have to give you unofficial YTA points because like... You told you mom that them having sex is 'disturbing and disgusting'? Like... What the fuck? People having sex is neither of those. They must have done it for you to exist, and obviously in a stable married relationship they'd have done it more than just to have you. It's a bonding thing. And I'm not saying that you cannot have a boundary of 'well I don't want to hear it going on', that's totally fair and normal. But to think of your parents having sex in general as disgusting and disturbing is just so disrespectful to me. I mean why? Because they're older? Because they're parents? Because they're not what one may call 'young and hot' anymore? Sex is normal.

I'd agree with you that involving nonconsenting people in your noisy sex is a shitty thing to do, but I definitely don't think the parents here should refrain from sex entirely because their adult kid is in another room in the apartment", "EXACTLY!! People love to say that if you're in a \"private room\"  you can do whatever you want. But they always seem to ignore the fact that you can't force someone to hear you fucking, and it's especially disgusting if it's your own child. \nSure, you can't expect your parents not to have sex, but they could have been more understanding and at least tell the son/daughter to go somewhere else, idk.\nI can't even imagine having loud sex knowing a family member is hearing, it's beyond gross", "Also, if the parents were the ones to listen and get mad, people would probably be in their side. Respect goes both ways.", "This!!!", "They insisted for me to come", "fuck that, kid gets a free vacation and then tries to gatekeep his parents' sex life, he's getting laughed at", "Agreed. ESH.", "Yes, I hate when people act like sex every damn week is a need", "As a hobbyist metalworker, \"hammer and tongs\" made me laugh so hard my back popped. I needed that, thank you lol", "Sounds like good advice tysm", "How hard is it to hold off a few days for fucks sake. A lot of people saying I\u2019m childish but my parents are the ones acting like horny teens", "Yeah everybody is making it seem like I\u2019m an awful person for expecting the same respect I have for my parents back. They don\u2019t wanna hear me, I don\u2019t want to hear them. It\u2019s that simple", "Just hearing the bed squeaking and the kissing is enough for me. It\u2019s traumatic enough.", "So I'm kinda interested here. Why is it gross? I mean people have sex and in relationships it's a common thing and bonds people. OP's parents are together for at least 20 years now. Why is them having sex gross? Because they're older? Because they're parents? I mean, I never thought of my parents having as sex as gross, so I don't understand why people do. Sex is just normal and of course parents would have it. Does that mean I'm sitting at their door listening? No ofc not. But if it happened, I'd just put in headphones and tell my mom in the morning that I could hear, could you keep it down next time please. I never saw it as disgusting.", "You mean have sex with his dad? \ud83d\ude02", "Ew wtf? Sounds like you wanna listen to your parents fuck", "\u201cBoundaries\u201d has also turned into an overused buzz word that people don\u2019t actually know the definition of.

Especially if you used the words \u201cdisturbing and disgusting\u201d to broach the subject. \n\nGet over yourself.", "It's not a \"I guess\" type of thing. You're 20 - Leave the house.", "I know you *did not* just come in here with a sound, nuanced take and level-headed judgment!\n\nWho does that?", "I don\u2019t think OP is using the word boundaries correctly. I can\u2019t have boundaries about two people\u2019s behavior that doesn\u2019t involve me. I can\u2019t have a boundary to not hear other people having sex unless the place said sex is happening is a place that falls within my personal boundaries like a house I own or rent.\n\nCould OP also have the boundary that his parents should never have sex again because he lives with them and might hear? Of course not. Unless OP paid for the hotel rental, OP cannot enforce that kind of boundary.", "Dude. I\u2019m 39.", "Nope it's the correct take. OP is an adult acting like a child. Go for a walk if you don't want to hear it.", "Nah the only correct take", "Very bad take", "YTA in that case. Could your parents have been a bit more sensitive? Yes, of course. But they way you approached them about this seems extremely abrasive. If you\u2019re not happy with the conditions of your free vacation, you\u2019re old enough to pay for your own trip somewhere with thicker walls.", "Be glad they didn\u2019t take out the leather and paddles, lol.", "because humans have needs, if one person loves another they are going to have sex, they are paying for this and all you have to do is just leave and let them have fun. my god you sound immature", " Because it\u2019s vacation. More time to have sex is literally one of the big benefits of being on vacation. Have you had to hear them going at it before? What\u2019s the history here?", "yeah but do you wanna hear your mom and dad fucking, not saying they\u2019re in the right but shouldn\u2019t some boundaries be made", "and by boundaries i mean they both compromise like kid says they\u2019ll go stay somewhere else or parents try to be a little bit more quiet", "Even 20 years ago, when I was 15, I knew to just put headphones in... this comment you made to someone who has a very valid opinion on YOUR post is uncalled for. There is a time for empathy and a time when you have to grow up. This would be the latter.\n\nYTA", "Are you sure you're 20 and not 13?", "You\u2019re being immature. Your parents having sex is how you came to be. Parents having sex isn\u2019t disgusting. A healthy, loving, consenting sex life is good news. You should be happy for your folks. Nobody wants to hear their parents have sex but it\u2019s better than having parents that fucking hate each other. Go buy some headphones, go for a walk, put on a movie. You don\u2019t get to use therapy speak and tell other people what to do and call it \u201cboundaries\u201d \nYou\u2019re mom is probably laughing at you cause you sound like a 10 year old learning what sex is for the first time instead of a 20 year old.", "So, you just want them to have completely silent sex?", "Wtf Put headphones in. Not hearing others is disgusting - listening to the own parents having sex and not doing anything to cant hear them is disgusting.", "And you\u2019re 20. You\u2019re an adult who could have refused. You accepted the trip. You don\u2019t get to tell them when and where they are allowed to have sex.", "And? You said you knew what they would be doing and yet you didn't bring your headphones. Your poor planning isn't their fault. Adults have sex, surely that's not news to you? Grow up dude.", "Did they hold a gun to your head?", "Seconded. ESH", "Who paid for this vacation? If not you, deal with it and grow up, maybe pay and go on your own vacations in future.", "Here is the thing boundaries are about what you do not what anyone else does. What they do in the privacy of their room is their business. Buy some headphones.", "Child, they are on vacation. You don\u2019t work your ass off your entire youth to not get to bang on vacation. If ANYONE has the right to act like horny teenagers, it\u2019s people who still like each other after raising a child together. You are acting childish. They have the right to enjoy vacation sexy time. You\u2019ve been messing that up for them for 21 years now. Stop. You\u2019re grown enough to be in on the secret that your parents are sexual beings that have the right to enjoy themselves. Don\u2019t vacation with them if you are that uptight.", "Most teens have sex rarely if at all, that's why they're so horny. For a lot of people, 40s-50s are the prime decades for boning down, that's when you know what you want and how to get it. Quit hating.", "Yeah, all the comments I saw are calling you spoiled for wanting basic privileges on a trip your parents wanted to take you on", "It's not gross for parents to have sex, but it is nasty for their kids, no matter how old, to have to hear it. No one wants to hear their parents getting down.", "Would you like to hear your parents grunting, moaning, squishing, clapping, squeaking, and bed hitting the wall while trying to go to sleep after an exhaustive day on vacation?", "I get it. Sex is great and sometimes you want to let the whole world know, but by either fucking loudly when others are around or telling them all about it you\u2019re dragging others into your sex life without their consent. That\u2019s where it gets icky. There\u2019s an exhibitionist quality to it that\u2019s fine if it\u2019s your jam, but make sure that those on the receiving end are willing parties, y\u2019know?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s not a time and place for loud, moany, dirty talking, break-the-furniture sex, but I am saying that family vacation time is not it. From OP\u2019s comments it sounds like it\u2019s more than quiet bed creaking.", "No hahahaha, but have it in front of them so they can see how uncomfortable it is!", "That could be fun lol", "And?? I was agreeing with you. I'm 73: I'm the Granny, as in \"Granny here\"! \ud83d\ude09", "I mean\u2026. you never know.", "Or they could have basic human respect for their daughter and take her feelings as something valuable instead of laughing like complete douchebags.", "If it\u2019s too quiet it\u2019s not worth it", "I don\u2019t care if they have an active sex life or not, that\u2019s not the point of this post. I hope they DO HAVE SEX. I just don\u2019t feel like they need to do it when my bed is literally separated from their by 2 meters and a paper wall. Is that so fucking hard to understand? They can wait to do it when we\u2019re back home, they\u2019re just choosing not to, and I feel disrespected by that as they doing it implies me hearing it", "\"Consenting sex\" OP didn't consent to being involved in a sexual situation, was forced to come on the trip, and made their boundary clear.", "Not when the privacy of their room is not private at all", "I guess that\u2019s Reddit \ud83d\ude05", "Exactly this. Everyone should have sex, I just don\u2019t want to hear it", "Then tell your parents you have needs!", "Oh! Excellent!! I guess technically I could be one too, tbh\u2026", "They\u2019re not required to abstain from sex in a separate room because their adult-child thinks it\u2019s icky. If adult-child doesn\u2019t like that their parents bone, don\u2019t go on vacation with them. Don\u2019t accept free vacations from them and then make demands about their private behavior! Take a walk. Get a hobby. Don\u2019t listen. Ignore them. But, you definitely do not get to tell grown ass adults they can\u2019t bone on vacation behind closed doors because it\u2019s not soundproof. That\u2019s just ridiculous.", "Expecting your parents to not have sex on vacation IS laughable. There were so many other solutions that OP could have done themselves without trying to rain on their parents' vacation that they are paying for.  Like use headphones. Leave the apt for a while and go sight see. \n\nVacation is the best time to have sex because you're getting away from all the stress so you can relax and really have some fun.", "She obviously has no clue how she got here lol", "Wrong, this is 2023 not 1903", "Ok are all these people commenting not understanding what the post is about or are you just the common denominator? You are being unkind and selfish to your parents. You do not get to have a say in what other people do especially your parents who paid for this trip.

How do you think you were made mate? Grow up. It's honestly a blessing that your parents still love each other and have an active sex life. \n\nPeople fuck. They are on vacation.

This would be the same thing if you were staying at a friends apartment.", "Nah, I was on your side until I read some of your replies.  You make every reply about you.  Its all about how the parents could make it easier for you and nothing about a compromise or any way maybe you could prevent hearing it  and even the ideas people give you you say\" I shouldn't have to\" \n\n\nYou are being selfish,  its thier vacation too.

No one, regardless of age, should have to hear or see their parents do the deed. It's traumatizing.", "They invited her. Like it\u2019s really not that much to ask they do it when she\u2019s gone or keep the sound down. The first time? Sure they can\u2019t tell if she hears but after she explicitly asks them to be quiet, would it kill them to be quiet? No. It\u2019s basic human respect.
