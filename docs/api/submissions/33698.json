We were a trio and didn\u2019t talk to other people in our grade very much (pretty unusual because we go to a very small school). This summer, I went to MA to visit my aunt. She owns a small jewelry store and I bought three matching necklaces for our friend group. I planned to give it to them for Christmas. \n\nThis year a new girl, Rosilee, moved to our area and starting going to the school we attend. She was very nice and unexpectedly joined our friend group. We all liked her very much as she seemed kind and funny. Her birthday is four days after Christmas, so I went shopping and got her a lot of stuff, typically more than I usually give for birthdays because she was easy to buy for and because I wanted to make sure she got stuff to make up for not getting one of the matching necklaces. I gave them to her the day before break and she thanked me a lot and told me how much she loved the gifts.\n\n I considered not giving my friends the necklaces because I didn\u2019t want her to feel left out, but I spent a lot on the necklaces and had been waiting to give them to Elise and Eleanor since August so I gave them the necklaces. I told them to not talk about them in front of Rosilee so she wouldn\u2019t feel excluded. They agreed and even if Rosilee noticed I thought it would be fine because she was so nice and she would understand. \n\n At lunch that day Rosilee came up to us and got really angry because of the necklaces. I tried telling her I got them before I knew her and I couldn\u2019t get another because they were from MA. She told us that was just an excuse and that if we really were friends with her I would\u2019ve never gave them the necklaces or I would\u2019ve asked my aunt to send another in the mail or something like that. She also said I was cheap for trying to give her \u201cshitty presents\u201d to make her not notice that she didn\u2019t get a necklace. I was getting a bit annoyed at her and said she was sensitive, and  Eleanor said we\u2019ve only been friends for 3 months and that it was just a necklace and Rosilee stormed away. Elise called after her that she was glad I hadn\u2019t gotten her a necklace because she wasn\u2019t our friend anyway. \n\nI feel like all of this is a really childish and stupid, but I\u2019m starting to feel a bit bad, both about the whole necklace thing and about what Elise, Eleanor and I said to her. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703389537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pmoxs/aita_for_only_giving_two_of_my_friends_matching/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've known them for 5 years and got the necklaces *before* you even *met* Rosilee. If I was in Rosilee's shoes I would feel a little awkward, but I wouldn't get mad at you, *especially* considering that you spent **more money** on gifts than you normally do for Rosilee's bday. You asked your friends to not talk about the necklaces in front of her. You put in **considerable effort** to not make her feel excluded.\n\n(also on the absolute entitlement and other aspect of bs in 'if we we're really friends, you would've gotten me one or not given them to anyone!' That's not how relationships work, gifts are nice, but they're not necessary. My boyfriend and I don't get each other expensive gifts, it doesn't mean we don't love each other). You're not going to get someone you've known for **3 months** the same kind of gifts you would get for your BFFs of **5 years**. It doesn't take a genius to understand it's *not personal*.", "NTA- You 3 has been friends for what? 6 years? thats quite a long time and you wanting to give the matching necklaces is very sweet and will most likely be a very nice memorabilia of your youth once you are a bit older. Meanwhile Rosilee had been your friend for 3 months and still got presents from you, just not the ones \"tailored\" for what sounds like your best friends (or atleast something close to BFs) and she threw out the whole friendship like a dirt rag in response on top of being ungrateful. (honestly just ask for the presents back if she keeps bugging you about it after the semester start, that should probably shut her up or make her stay away afterwards).  \n  \nAlso if you want some perspective, I have had a cabbage in my fridge for longer than your entire friendship with Rosilee and i have also had 2+ year friendships that went up in flames in less than 10 minutes due to a stupid argument (about gaming history and design of all things) so you should not feel to bad about it since you did not start the crapshow and your comments in response to her outburst were not out of line either.  \n  \nAnyhow they say that close friendships that can last for 7+ years even without mandatory gatherings (i.e school, workplace and so on) are extremely likely to last a lifetime so take care of Elise and Eleanor since it seems they got your back :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean, you didn\u2019t actually think she wouldn\u2019t notice when the three of you showed up in new, identical necklaces, right?  Is she blind?"]}
