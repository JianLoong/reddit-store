I recently received a massage from a licensed therapist and my Partner got extremely upset and jealous, making me feel like an asshole.\n\nContext: I have been with my heterosexual partner for 5 years and we live together. We are in our late 30s and mid 40s. We have had couples massage before together, no big deal.\n\nFast forward a couple years, and my neck and shoulder problems are flaring up - bad posture from sitting all day in front of a computer. I decide to use my left over FSA money (it expires end of month) to book a massage therapist for a deep tissue treatment. My requirements for a therapist are pretty simple - good reviews, proximity, licensed professional, and deep tissue. The one I found was in a rich neighborhood and not the cheapest. 4 practitioners total. When you book online, you book by type of massage. This specific practice only had one therapist offering deep tissue (plus rolfing, sports massage, myofascial, reflexology, and prenatal).\n\nI had to request a doctor's note to have the expenses qualify for FSA. The week of my session, this was all made very clear to my partner. The afternoon of my session, as I'm walking out the door, my partner made some jokes to me about receiving sexual pleasure from the therapist. I laughed because I genuinely thought my partner was joking around with me.\n\nI have my 90 minute session (mostly painful, as it was the first time I've had rolfing done) and come back home. I tell my partner about the painful rolfing experience and explain what it means. More jokes were said to me about how I enjoyed my sexual acts. I laughed it off. Then my partner asked me \"do you think its ok if another \\[insert gender\\] rubs your naked body for 90 minutes?\" At first I was surprised at this, then saw where this was going. I replied \"Yes, of course. They're a licensed professional.\"\n\nMy partner got up and walked away without saying much else. Over the past 36 hours, my partner has iced me out, barely communicating with me. Just Yes or No responses to basic questions. Clearly upset but not willing to talk. I made an attempt this morning and asked what was wrong, but was met with \"nothing\".\n\nAfter a bit, my partner finally comes to me, clearly visibly upset, and accuses me of purposely finding a \"hot \\[insert gender\\]\" therapist to get a massage from. I ask my partner directly \"Do you think my intent was to have some kind of sexual gratification/experience out of this session?\" and my partner replied \"Yes\". My partner also claims that this is not normal behavior and questions why I wouldn't get a therapist of the same gender. I recognize that sleazy massage parlors exist, but I am not that kind of person and I went to a professionally licensed therapist to help alleviate actual pain and soreness.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678414347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nbl9a/aita_for_getting_a_massage_from_a_licensed/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
