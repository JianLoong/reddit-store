He can mess up his own PC with Viruses though maybe consider moving that stuff in with you instead of just locking the room", "NTA. Rules were clear and he obviously understood them, since he followed them just fine for several years. It's your parent's house and they seem to have agreed to the arrangement and agree that it's a reasonable consequence. He's old enough to understand that he isn't entitled to other people's things. It was a privilege that is being revoked due to his own actions.", "NTA - simply because your mom had already change the locks to the room AND SHE OWNS the place.\n\nValuable things should have moved with you (special edition lego sets. You are a bit of an A H for wanting to charge $500 on things left behind).", "NTA you gave him a privilege and he broke the rules, actions have consequences", "NTA. I think you did a really good job setting expectations, teaching him how to follow the expectations, and being generous to a point. I think it would be reasonable for you to say that you're going to lock it for 6 months until he's a little bit older. You might want to say something like \"This is partially my responsibility, because I thought you were old enough to handle this and I should have known better. I'm going to wait for you to get a little bit older and then we can try again.\" \n\nI'm a little confused about one part. Are you planning on having him buy the PC so that he can use it? Or did he completely break it and you're having him replace it and then locking it up? I'm not sure that either one is a terrible idea but 500 is a lot for a kid that age.", "NTA", "INFO: Why do you think it's your place to control your brother's access to a room in your parent's house? It's not even being used as your bedroom anymore.", "YTA - but not a huge one...it's just that you haven't lived there in 5 years, it's not \"your\" room. Take your toys and store them at your own place. However it isn't cool if he broke your things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The computers are used by my parents too, well, mostly my mother. She does their tax stuff and whatnot. Legos aren\u2019t really much of a concern, except the sealed boxes. There\u2019s a ton of vintage stuff that could give you a nice down payment on a car if sold. Or, pay for someone to attend college. More of an investment than a hobby. Pay $150 now, sell it for $1000 5 years later, you know?", "He has an Xbox that he\u2019s broken before (I paid to get it repaired). Has a Nintendo Switch, gaming laptop, high refresh rate monitors\u2026 I\u2019ve made sure he\u2019s always had access to the fastest internet in town. I mean, if he wanted, he had it. And he\u2019s a good kid too. I wouldn\u2019t be taking away anything I\u2019ve given him. What I told him is his, it\u2019s his. It\u2019s just very disheartening to find legos all over the floor or shoved under the tables/bed, vintage sets opened (that he was not allowed to build), and the PCs covered in so much dust and pet hair that require disassembly for a good cleaning. The things have dust filters!! Dust so thick you couldn\u2019t see through them\u2026", "His dad won\u2019t be around much longer, I\u2019m afraid. 3 types of cancer took a toll on the old man. I work in healthcare so I know where this is going. It still sucks. I\u2019m trying to teach him as much as I can while being away for that reason. As far as the money goes, he makes a pretty decent chunk doing chores and whatnot. Mowing grass for the neighbors, and things like that. He can easily come up with $500 in a couple of months. The computer itself used to be top-of-the-line about 4 years ago. Would have cost $3k new, and as it sits, it\u2019s still worth around $2000. It\u2019s not broken. Although due to poor maintenance, he did manage to short out the motherboard before. Dust bunnies kept it from turning on. The $500 would basically cover the cost of a new case (something that would be easier to clean) and a proper chair that he would get for Christmas (he\u2019s using an old couch so terrible ergonomics).", "My mother had made the decision to change the locks on the room before I came home to visit. I stay here when I\u2019m home. Out of all the kids, I\u2019m the one who takes care of them. If something breaks, I fix it or replace it. If they want to do some remodeling, I take care of that too. I\u2019m able and willing. They\u2019ve always told me this will never not be my home. I still respect their rules when I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll be looking into building a home of my own within the next 3 years so all my junk will be out of their way soon enough.", "The mom already changed or added a lock to the room, meaning OP has a storing agreements with the owners (parents).", "They're OP's items and if the parents have agreed to store them and have agreed to the rules placed on brother's use of them, then why wouldn't it be OP's place to decide who has access?", "Yeah that is true. I plan on building a home of my own soon. In the meantime, I\u2019ve stored all my trinkets and gadgets here, at my parents. After they couldn\u2019t afford their house, I gave up my dream and decided to help them keep theirs. Made them a promise that they would never have to work ever again and it\u2019s worked out thus far. They have what they need, and I do what I can to give them what they want.", "Yeah makes sense, I would still recommend moving anything valuable out instead, might be rough but you know it would be safe from tampering\n\nEdit: just saw your comment about traveling constantly, makes sense to store it at their place instead", "Okay. Well I actually think that having consistency with him is important right now while he's going through something tough. But it's also important to have compassion. You might want to set him down and talk about the cost and ask him how he thinks it should be handled. That's another way to teach him. If he comes up with a dumb answer, you can always still charge him 500 bucks. But when I got in trouble with my parents would always ask me what I thought my punishment would be, and often it was harsher than anything they were planning on doing. I think it was a good lesson to make me come up with consequences on my own before they settled on them. You might want to consider giving him a few options for how to repay you and move forward. \n\nIt might also make sense to limit his access to your computers because he's probably about to discover porn if he hasn't, and you know that shit can come with viruses.", "If your mother put a lock on the door, it should keep him out. At this point, she made the decision to revoke his access, not you.", "To the items themselves, yes, but to the entire room? I agree with the comment that said that if OP really cares about what happens to this stuff, they should bring it to their own place.", "Sounds like you're a good son. I wouldn't like finding my stuff broken either.", "It\u2019s hard to do in the area. It would have to be temperature controlled specially because of the instruments (high-end guitars). At least at my parents\u2019 there\u2019s always a watchful eye. My little brother has basically no interest in those, so they\u2019re relatively safe. I think after a long conversation with him, he might understand. This would all be a temporary measure, and seeing as my mother has also noticed and taken action already, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have full access again and be able to enjoy all the stuff I\u2019ve accumulated throughout the years. Other than the super valuable stuff, I will leave this to him once I get my place up and ready. I\u2019m just trying to teach him responsibility, accountability, and respect to another person\u2019s property.", "Valid points. I think making choose his punishment is a good idea. Use the $500 as a backup. I\u2019ll discuss that with my mother, see what she thinks. As far as porn, I got those restricted by the ISP. He doesn\u2019t have the greatest friend group, and they\u2019re not allowed in the house for various reasons, not all of them anyways. I can always get an app that monitors internet traffic should the need arise. The computer might become his, but he\u2019s still living under my parents\u2019 roof, so rules will apply. I just hope the old man can hang on until I\u2019m done with my travels.", "I live on the road so I don\u2019t have home home. When I took off traveling, my parents told me I can use the room as storage. I helped them pay for the house when they couldn\u2019t afford it, so I agreed. I plan on building a home of my own in the next 3 years or so. I\u2019m building it with my own hands. The room itself is pretty large, and was added on before my parents bought the house.", "Man, I remember growing up with a dirt floor, and this was in the 90s! We\u2019ve always had our differences, but I won\u2019t forget the sacrifices my parents did so I could have a better future. I want them to know their sacrifices were not in vain, and I don\u2019t want for my little brother to go through the things we did.\n\nEdit: word"]}
