The other half still belongs to my dad.\n\nI (25f) moved out 6 years ago and my sister (27f) has stayed in the house with her husband (29m) and their son (8m). When I first moved out we agreed that they should pay me rent, since it would be better for me if we rented the house to someone else to get some extra income. Until now we really haven't followed through with it, because I had a full time job, could afford my life by myself and they both were still in school. \n\nSince then a couple things have changed: I quit my job and started University last year. I live in Germany, so I don't have to pay tuition, but with my rent, bills, food, books for Uni and the semester fee I have to pay, I still have many expenses. So besides going to Uni full time, I now have 2 jobs to pay for everything. Until a little earlier this year everything was fine, but since everything has gotten more expensive I really can't afford my life anymore. But with work and studying I'm already at around 60 hours a week, so I just don't have the time (or energy) to get another job. \n\nI remembered the agreement a while ago and have talked to my sister about it, who refused to pay stating that they don't have enough money either. Both of them have full time jobs and because they life on our owned property they don't have to pay rent, just the costs that come with a house. \n\nI'm asking for about half of what I could get if we rented the house to someone else and got a quarter of that amount, so I don't think I'm being unreasonable. It still would be better for me if they moved out and we got tenants. \n\nMy dad got involved and said that they really don't have that much money and can barely save anything every month, which really upset me, because I had to dip into my savings each month to cover rent and my bills.

When you only own 1/4 of something you can't tell the 3/4 what to do with it, if dad and sister say no to rent, there isn't much you can do about it. This is going to get really nasty too. Decide if this is a hill to die on, as far as I know you can only do 1 thing and that is force the sell of the house, and I'm not sure you can do that everywhere.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they should have been paying rent, you should have been collecting it from the beginning regardless of your situation. Setting a trend of non-collection has meant they have taylored their lifestyle accordingly.\n\nYou've now changed your lifestyle which means you're now calling in the rent. However you're NTA given the original agreement.\n\nQuestion: are they paying dues/rates or land taxes to local government that you should be contributing to?", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to dip into your savings when you have an asset that could be helping alleviate the strain.", "NTA, honestly it was kind enough of you to let it go for so many years up until now, and they should respect and appreciate that by paying rent now. If they can't figure saving after paying you rent, they need to re-assess their lifestyle and spending choices. \n\nHowever, as much as I agree with you, I'm sorry to say that I don't think any resolution will come from this that won't end in some bitter feelings. If the rent is important to you (and you don't mind slightly pissing off the family, since BIL and dad seem to be backing her up on this), stand your ground. If it's not worth the hassle, let it go, because even though you're absolutely right, it may not be worth losing family over it.", "NTA but without a written agreement it's hard to see how you can enforce it as a precedent has been set already and it only relates to a quarter of the house.", "NA. \nThose 3 people doesn't seem have so much care of you like you ,instead, care till now for them.", "NTA. There was an original agreement, which wasn\u2019t enforced for years. It\u2019s unfair that they live rent free in a house you co-own when you can\u2019t financially benefit from it. What\u2019s going on that they both work full time, don\u2019t pay rent or mortgage, yet are still struggling?", "I think ESH.\n\nYour sister and her husband should be paying a rent to your father and to you according to how much of the house you own. \n\nBut I do think it's kind of shitty to suddenly ask your sister to pay rent just because you made the decision to quit your job. Especially, as you only own 1/4 of the house and that the rent she would pay you wouldn't be that much...", "NTA, but I\u2019m sorry this is probably gonna screw your relationship up. Legally, they don\u2019t actually owe you rent, your only real recourse is to force a sale. Morally they should just pay you like it was agreed, but if both her and your dad don\u2019t agree they should then I doubt your gonna get your money. Legally you can threaten to force a sale of the property or them buy out your percentage, but that will destroy your relationship with them.", "Info: why has no one offered to buy you out for your share?", "I don't know about property laws. But when I moved out they all agreed that I should be getting rent from them. And my dad does think it's fair as well, he just says it's not the right time to ask for the rent. \nI feel like I have been really lenient so far though. Now I really need it, so I just reminded them of the initial agreement.", "I think this INFO is really a key point. If OP is still paying for the house in some way, then it is absolutely fair for them to collect rent. \n\nStill, this is a case for enforcing agreements even when you don't strictly need to.", "Working full time can mean a lot things:\n\nMy wife and I have always worked full time. Initially I was working in a supermarket and she was working in a cafe. We struggled with 2 kids.\n\nNow, with 3 kids, I've managed to work my way up to being in the IT department of a major bank and my wife attained her nursing qualification and works in a hospital. We are no longer struggling despite our expenses being more than double what they were when we got married 15 years ago.", "Because (quote from sister) \"we can't afford it and are not willing to take out a loan\". And my dad doesn't see the point, seeing as his half will eventually be split between us as well and that makes it easier for him than making sure I get money when they get the rest of the house. Does that make sense?", "Seems OP isn't paying anything for the house and sister and BIL are paying the \"costs that come with the house.\" \n\nCertain costs such as land tax/rates and insurance should be incurred by all owners. If sister and BIL are paying this in full, then OP's portion of that should be deducted from the \u00bc value of rent if they had normal tenants. \n\nObviously bills for energy etc shouldn't be a part of this calculation. But OP might not be legally or morally entitled to as much as she thinks.", "How does that matter? OP is a partial owner of some property, so it's natural that they would try to use the property in some way at some point.\n\nIt's not a case for enforcing an agreement when you don't strictly need to. OP is going into their savings to pay for the current lifestyle. They really need the money.", "OP's sister and BIL have one kid. Even if they both work for minimum wage, that would still be a combined income of a bit under 4000 Euros.\nSince they are married and have a child, they are in a very good tax bracket.\n\nThey can afford a few hundred Euros of rent. It's not like OP wants a shitton of money from them.", ">How does that matter? OP is a partial owner of some property, so it's natural that they would try to use the property in some way at some point.\n\nIt impacts the amount that the OP is due. For instance, if the sister takes care of fees, taxes, and house maintenance/repairs, then the OP is acting as less than 1/4 of a landlord, and a proportionate amount ought to be removed. This could, in fact, be significant.\n\n>It's not a case for enforcing an agreement when you don't strictly need to. OP is going into their savings to pay for the current lifestyle. They really need the money.\n\nI mean that the resistance from the sister is likely due to the precedent. Being lenient was generous on OP's part, but people are often resentful at having benefits taken away from them. This would not have been an issue if the sister had been paying rent the entire time.", "NTA. Get lawyers involved because you may have messed up big time by not collecting the rent on the original agreement. You set the precedent that they don't have to pay you anything.", "I don't know. They did feel like they had enough money to get a dog recently though. And because the question came up as well, they make more than minimum wage. Not a crazy amount, but definitely more. \n\nThank you for your opinion!", ">as you only own 1/4 of the house and that the rent she would pay you wouldn't be that much\n\nSo then it shouldn't be an issue to pay up. You think OP is bathing in money. Absolutely NTA.", "They aren't paying the taxes. My dad is, since he is the majority shareholder. They are \"just\" paying gas, electricity, waste collection, internet and such things that come with every renting agreement as well, meaning I pay the same thing for my appartment. And I get that it's much more expensive to heat a house, etc.\n\nBut you might be right. I should have followed through from the beginning. I felt like I was being nice, because I didn't need the extra cash. \n\nThank you for your opinion though :)", "I think if you really needed to, you could force the issue by selling your portion of the house, and then they can either take it or leave it. I don't know the specifics of the law in Germany, but you would likely have a case to push this legally because you are not living there.\n\nI get why your sister doesn't want to, but at a certain point it does seem like they are taking advantage at your expense.", "You're welcome.\n\nI hope you find a mutually beneficial resolution.", "Exactly what else do we know about their situation? Any specific health/specialist costs for themselves or the kid? Specialist educational requirements? \n\nThere could be any number of things taking away from the earnings.", "They live in Germany. Specialist healthcare costs are covered by statuatory health insurance, special educational costs are covered by the state.", "Well in that case, would appear there's little reason not to pay some rent."]}
