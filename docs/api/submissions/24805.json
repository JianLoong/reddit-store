Kelsie's mom and my dad had an affair way back when before I was born. He stayed married to my mom who died in 2020 and after me, they had my siblings who are 19, 16, and 14. While she was never really part of the family (probably for obvious reasons) Kelsie and my dad stayed in touch but they had a rocky relationship. Kelsie lives in the next state over but he would try to stay involved in her life. He took her to dinners on some of her birthdays, attended graduations and school events (sometimes, not always), and supported her financially, even sending her money in adulthood.\n\nThat said, she has always resented him and will go back and forth between liking him and including him in her life, to hating him and making a big deal of it publicly (via social media). I'll be honest, none of his kids have ever had a particularly close relationship with him. He wasn't a terrible guy, just not always a great father figure, if that makes sense. I never had any hard feelings towards Kelsie for being angry with him and sometimes even understood her frustrations.\n\nKelsie hadn't spoken to him in a year or so. Last I saw on her social media and from him telling me, she wanted \"nothing to do with him.\" He died suddenly recently. I called Kelsie to let her know. She said okay and asked if there was something she was supposed to do, to which I told her no. She said thanks for calling and hung up.\n\nI wrote the obituary. It was written a bit hastily (as I had other things to do) and was very basic. I did not include her in the \"survived by\" portion. Kelsie didn't come to the funeral (her mom sent flowers addressed from both of them). However, Kelsie called me fuming that she was not included in the obituary. She's called me every name in the book on the phone, via text, and in social media posts. I told her I thought she didn't want anything to do with him. Her response was \"this is different.\" Her mother is also angry with me about it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Forgot to paste this. Her last social media post about him from about a year ago was \"I've disowned my mom's sperm donor from my life and have never been happier.\" I took this into consideration when omitting her from the obit.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692216315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t0fmy/aita_for_leaving_my_halfsister_out_of_our_dads/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She got exactly what she asked for. She also didn't even come to the funeral. NTA. \n\nSince she's prone to making her personal drama public, I assume to garner sympathy, my guess is she's mad because she wanted to post the obituary with her name to again garner social media sympathy.", "I don't think you're the asshole but I certainly understand her being upset. That said, I can't imagine you care to actually apologize or do anything to keep a relationship with her, so just take the feedback and do with it what you will", "NAH:  Mainly because I'm not going to call a 22 year old an asshole for a decision they made after losing their father.", "ESH. Kelsie's relationship with your dad was not normal. She was the result of an affair, and it sounds like she always felt like a second-tier kid. Now that he's gone, she's probably dealing with a lot of unresolved feelings toward him and she'll never really have closure on that front. Lots of people who are estranged from their parents are still mentioned in the obituary as their children, and regardless of how she felt about your dad Kelsie probably saw her being left out as being disregarded because she's the half-sister, the adulterous love child.\n\nThat being said, I think she's making too big a deal out of the obituary (again, I think it's representative of a long history of complicated and hurt feelings) and if I were her I'd get into therapy stat.", "NTA she made a public post calling him sperm donor... she can lay in her bed", "I don\u2019t know a lot about the formalities of these things but if she wasn\u2019t even close enough to attend the service, why does she even care that she wasn\u2019t in the obituary? So no you\u2019re not. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you did it out of spite. Would it have hurt to include her? No. You made a call based on the info you had, which you believed to be wanting nothing to do with him. She wasn\u2019t even there. You were having to put this together in haste. \n\nIf the call you made was wrong and, in hindsight, you would change it with this new info that she does actually care then own the mistake, apologize, chalk it up to a life lesson, and move on. \n\nSorry for you loss and best of luck to you.", "NTA. When my dad died we contacted his kids who he hadn't talked to in like 10+ years. \n\n\nThey got mad we didn't take them into account when planning the celebration of life...we held it on a weekend so it was easier for people who lived in a different town. That weekend was one of their kids graduations. I told them the fact that the kid would be more upset about missing his graduation VS the fact his biological grandpa died spoke volumes. \n\n\nI told them they chose not to be in his life so we chose not to include them in decision making.", "YTA\n\nEven if she didn't have a good relationship with your father.

How would you feel had your dad chosen not to be your dad and instead went on to father 4 children after you and remained involved fully in their life while only giving you crumbs. \n\nHe barely acknowledged her in life and YOU didn't acknowledge her in his death. I see why she limited his access to her in adulthood. You're acting like this poor girl did something wrong when all she did was be born as a result of your dad's poor decisions.", "YTA - the dad is the main AH here. he cheated on his wife, got his mistress pregnant and that kid grew up to have all kinds of mixed feelings which is completely justified. your dad screwed her and her mom up. just because you got to be apart of his \"real family\" doesn't change that he and you are AHs", "YTA. You said she was hot and cold on her father, and it seemed like you understood why. You were also in contact with Kelsie and could have just asked her if she wanted to be mentioned in the obituary when you called her to tell her of his passing.\n\nInstead, you made the wrong assumption and now you're the asshole.\n\nShe could have said no on that phone call and then threw a fit and would have no leg to stand on. But everyone knows it's really not a good look for someone to exclude the bastard child from an obituary.\n\nJust have the obituary revised and apologize for making the wrong assumption and not asking her if she wanted to be included. She shares 50% of his DNA, just like you, and has every right to make that decision for herself. It was wrong of you to make it for her.", "She wasn't treating him like family, which she has every right to do, but she wanted nothing to do with him and this would be included. I feel like if she wanted to be suddenly included, she could have made it clearer. NTA.\n\nI don't know how close they were, it's possible she was truly mourning him in her own way, but the cynic in me screams that she wanted the obituary for time off of work.", "YTA. Her disavowing him seems to stem from resentment about hum being a sperm donor rather than a dad. By omitting her you reinforced that she didn't really matter and it would have cost you nothing to include her.", "YTA. Her relationship with her dad is between the two of them. She was still his daughter and it sounds like he still cared for her. You intentionally chose to disregard that she is family and excluded her from his obituary.\n\nEdit: Also if it's an online one from a funeral home, you could probably call them and ask them to edit it if it's a problem you decide to resolve. Otherwise, YTA still.", "YTA - There are facts and feelings.  You put feelings over facts.  The fact is, to your dad, she is family.", "If you left her out intentionally ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell whether you meant to because you talk down on their relationship, but then go on to say the obituary is written in haste.\n\nIf not, NTA, it\u2019s an honest mistake, and she has a right to be upset about being left out of her father\u2019s obituary, but she shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you.", "YTA. You denied your half-sister\u2019s existence by writing it the way you did.", "YTA. You did the same thing your father did, ignored her place in his life as a daughter. It's like you gave hercthe final reminder that she wasn't considered a part of his family.", "NTA\n\nHonestly no one\u2019s an asshole here. It just sounds like you were grieving and forced to organize things quickly. As she wasn\u2019t around the planning, organization, or funeral, it\u2019s natural that you might not think about her immediately. You did make a mistake in assuming her intentions and not asking her about it, but that\u2019s not a crime worthy of asshole label and completely understandable. I would recommend planning a simple apology to this extent and texting or calling her with it if it\u2019s bothering you.\n\nThat being said it\u2019s also not okay to slander people over social media and your half- sister should take into account that it was a complicated situation and you all are grieving too.", "ESH, slightly.  Yes, she said she wanted nothing to do with him.  But she's right that your father passing away is different.\n\nYou're young enough -- younger than her, in fact -- that this is just one of those \"live and learn\" experiences.  However, Kelsie's mom being mad at you seems worse.  Sure, she lost her affair partner, but she's literally mad at someone her daughter's age for not behaving like a much older person at a time of stress and grief.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I'd block them and be done with it.  Their difficult relationship with your deceased dad doesn't need to be inherited by you.  If they're able to stop punishing you for their issues with him, that's a new leaf.", "NTA but it wouldn't hurt to apologize. You wrote it in a rush, your dad just died, its understandable. However, an obituary is more of a factual statement of surviving kin - and she is surviving kin. Wouldn't have hurt to include her.", "NTA. She can write her own obituary for him", "YTA - you either list them all or none.", "Yta i hate to call a 22yo who lost their dad an ahole, but you did ask.   Like her or not, she exists.  Its not surprising she had a rocky relationship with the married guy who got her mom pregnant, popped in and out of her life at his convenience, and made sure she knew she wasn't 'real' family.\n\nSucky all around and I'm sorry for your losses.", "YTA\n\nYou know he has a rocky relationship with his kids, but you seem willing to hold it against her moreso without acknowledging there are very obvious reasons why her relationship would be particularly rocky. A social media post you don't seem to have context from is a terrible reason to make decisions on. You had ample time to have actually asked her about it within the last year or at least asked her opinion before you published anything. Since you seem to not consider her a sibling either and don't seem to talk much to her, which keeping her out of the obit also implies, for all you know they may have had some contact since he last mentioned her you are unaware of that your father just didn't mention. It was a post from a whole year ago. \n\nThere's a high chance she didn't come to the funeral to avoid an awkward encounter with your family, not out of resentment of your dad. Since the obit comes out before the funeral, you reinforced that she should stay away and would not be welcomed. You potentially robbed her of a way to say goodbye in an official sense while erasing her further from his life.\n\nThere is a strong chance your father would not have approved of leaving her out as he seems to have publicly acknowledged her. Your father's intent to recognize her as a daughter in the past should matter. She was his child, and he treated her as such, even if it wasn't always great. You should not have publicly tried to pretend that didn't happen \n\nI get this is rough and I'm sorry you're hurting, but you do owe her an apology still because I'm not sure you understand the significance of erasing her on that level and should recognize that a not good relationship likely doesn't mean this is easy on her end either.
