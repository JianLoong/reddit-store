Kelsie's mom and my dad had an affair way back when before I was born. He stayed married to my mom who died in 2020 and after me, they had my siblings who are 19, 16, and 14. While she was never really part of the family (probably for obvious reasons) Kelsie and my dad stayed in touch but they had a rocky relationship.

He took her to dinners on some of her birthdays, attended graduations and school events (sometimes, not always), and supported her financially, even sending her money in adulthood.\n\nThat said, she has always resented him and will go back and forth between liking him and including him in her life, to hating him and making a big deal of it publicly (via social media). I'll be honest, none of his kids have ever had a particularly close relationship with him. He wasn't a terrible guy, just not always a great father figure, if that makes sense. I never had any hard feelings towards Kelsie for being angry with him and sometimes even understood her frustrations.\n\nKelsie hadn't spoken to him in a year or so. Last I saw on her social media and from him telling me, she wanted \"nothing to do with him.\" He died suddenly recently. I called Kelsie to let her know. She said okay and asked if there was something she was supposed to do, to which I told her no. She said thanks for calling and hung up.\n\nI wrote the obituary. It was written a bit hastily (as I had other things to do) and was very basic. I did not include her in the \"survived by\" portion. Kelsie didn't come to the funeral (her mom sent flowers addressed from both of them). However, Kelsie called me fuming that she was not included in the obituary. She's called me every name in the book on the phone, via text, and in social media posts. I told her I thought she didn't want anything to do with him. Her response was \"this is different.\" Her mother is also angry with me about it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Forgot to paste this.

Kelsie's relationship with your dad was not normal. She was the result of an affair, and it sounds like she always felt like a second-tier kid. Now that he's gone, she's probably dealing with a lot of unresolved feelings toward him and she'll never really have closure on that front. Lots of people who are estranged from their parents are still mentioned in the obituary as their children, and regardless of how she felt about your dad Kelsie probably saw her being left out as being disregarded because she's the half-sister, the adulterous love child.\n\nThat being said, I think she's making too big a deal out of the obituary (again, I think it's representative of a long history of complicated and hurt feelings) and if I were her I'd get into therapy stat.", "NTA she made a public post calling him sperm donor... she can lay in her bed", "I don\u2019t know a lot about the formalities of these things but if she wasn\u2019t even close enough to attend the service, why does she even care that she wasn\u2019t in the obituary?

No. You made a call based on the info you had, which you believed to be wanting nothing to do with him. She wasn\u2019t even there. You were having to put this together in haste. \n\nIf the call you made was wrong and, in hindsight, you would change it with this new info that she does actually care then own the mistake, apologize, chalk it up to a life lesson, and move on. \n\nSorry for you loss and best of luck to you.", "NTA. When my dad died we contacted his kids who he hadn't talked to in like 10+ years. \n\n\nThey got mad we didn't take them into account when planning the celebration of life...we held it on a weekend so it was easier for people who lived in a different town.

I see why she limited his access to her in adulthood. You're acting like this poor girl did something wrong when all she did was be born as a result of your dad's poor decisions.", "YTA - the dad is the main AH here. he cheated on his wife, got his mistress pregnant and that kid grew up to have all kinds of mixed feelings which is completely justified. your dad screwed her and her mom up. just because you got to be apart of his \"real family\" doesn't change that he and you are AHs", "YTA.

You did make a mistake in assuming her intentions and not asking her about it, but that\u2019s not a crime worthy of asshole label and completely understandable. I would recommend planning a simple apology to this extent and texting or calling her with it if it\u2019s bothering you.\n\nThat being said it\u2019s also not okay to slander people over social media and your half- sister should take into account that it was a complicated situation and you all are grieving too.", "ESH, slightly.

Sure, she lost her affair partner, but she's literally mad at someone her daughter's age for not behaving like a much older person at a time of stress and grief.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I'd block them and be done with it.  Their difficult relationship with your deceased dad doesn't need to be inherited by you.  If they're able to stop punishing you for their issues with him, that's a new leaf.", "NTA but it wouldn't hurt to apologize. You wrote it in a rush, your dad just died, its understandable.

She can write her own obituary for him", "YTA - you either list them all or none.", "Yta i hate to call a 22yo who lost their dad an ahole, but you did ask.   Like her or not, she exists.  Its not surprising she had a rocky relationship with the married guy who got her mom pregnant, popped in and out of her life at his convenience, and made sure she knew she wasn't 'real' family.\n\nSucky all around and I'm sorry for your losses.", "YTA\n\nYou know he has a rocky relationship with his kids, but you seem willing to hold it against her moreso without acknowledging there are very obvious reasons why her relationship would be particularly rocky. A social media post you don't seem to have context from is a terrible reason to make decisions on. You had ample time to have actually asked her about it within the last year or at least asked her opinion before you published anything. Since you seem to not consider her a sibling either and don't seem to talk much to her, which keeping her out of the obit also implies, for all you know they may have had some contact since he last mentioned her you are unaware of that your father just didn't mention. It was a post from a whole year ago. \n\nThere's a high chance she didn't come to the funeral to avoid an awkward encounter with your family, not out of resentment of your dad. Since the obit comes out before the funeral, you reinforced that she should stay away and would not be welcomed. You potentially robbed her of a way to say goodbye in an official sense while erasing her further from his life.\n\nThere is a strong chance your father would not have approved of leaving her out as he seems to have publicly acknowledged her. Your father's intent to recognize her as a daughter in the past should matter. She was his child, and he treated her as such, even if it wasn't always great. You should not have publicly tried to pretend that didn't happen \n\nI get this is rough and I'm sorry you're hurting, but you do owe her an apology still because I'm not sure you understand the significance of erasing her on that level and should recognize that a not good relationship likely doesn't mean this is easy on her end either.
