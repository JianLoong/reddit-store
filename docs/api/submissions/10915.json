I said she could pick out any style because I wanted them to be able to wear the dress again. However, I also said to *get approval before purchase and she didn't*. Second, I was allowing her to wear the dress even after she didn't get approval because she really liked it. I even told her she could undo the adjustments at the reception, but for pictures to wear it a certain way. Lastly, I kicked her out because she claimed me wanting her to wear a shawl for 30 minutes was because I \"didn't want competition\". THAT'S why I removed her.

I was once involved in a wedding in the Netherlands and customs were very different than ours.  For example, the groom\u2019s sisters were horrified that the maid of honour and myself purposely wore matching dresses.  In North America, wedding party doesn\u2019t usually refer to an event but rather to the attendants for the bride and groom on the wedding day.  Rather than just having witnesses to sign the marriage certificate, the bride will have a maid/matron of honour (usually one of the witnesses) and then additional bridesmaids (the number varies).  The groom will have a best man and then groomsmen, again the number varies but you usually see an equal number of people \u201cstanding up\u201d for the bride and groom. \n\nSo, TLDR, in North America the wedding party is a group of people, not a party.  \ud83d\ude0a", "And should be removed from the space ship!", "Yikes.
