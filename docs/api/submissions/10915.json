She outed herself by outwardly projecting that she thinks you view it as a competition. Not only that but you offered her a compromise and she said no.

Good riddance.", "People care *way* too much about their stupid weddings. Just the whole position that you\u2019d need a whole designated person to \u201chelp the bride keep her sanity\u201d for a one day event that effects\u2026 basically two people, is just ridiculous.

Your sister would probably drag all attention to herself and most likely ruin something", "Okay, but really the MOH job is to hold the ring for your husband/wife/other. Anything more is just extra duties.\n\nYou specified colours to your bridal party by the sounds of things. But not cuts. Yes your sister has picked something that is a bit extra, but depending on the style and the dress code might not be that extra.\n\nIf you have restrictions on styles, you must lay that out from the get go.

You seriously can't see where it's obvious that sis is attempting to compete?", "You're quite right.....sort of. I said she could pick out any style because I wanted them to be able to wear the dress again. However, I also said to *get approval before purchase and she didn't*. Second, I was allowing her to wear the dress even after she didn't get approval because she really liked it. I even told her she could undo the adjustments at the reception, but for pictures to wear it a certain way. Lastly, I kicked her out because she claimed me wanting her to wear a shawl for 30 minutes was because I \"didn't want competition\". THAT'S why I removed her. Thank you for your feedback!", "I have my future sister-in-law on alert. ;) Thank you for your feedback!", "I\u2019m guessing you are not from North America.  I was once involved in a wedding in the Netherlands and customs were very different than ours.  For example, the groom\u2019s sisters were horrified that the maid of honour and myself purposely wore matching dresses.  In North America, wedding party doesn\u2019t usually refer to an event but rather to the attendants for the bride and groom on the wedding day.  Rather than just having witnesses to sign the marriage certificate, the bride will have a maid/matron of honour (usually one of the witnesses) and then additional bridesmaids (the number varies).  The groom will have a best man and then groomsmen, again the number varies but you usually see an equal number of people \u201cstanding up\u201d for the bride and groom. \n\nSo, TLDR, in North America the wedding party is a group of people, not a party.  \ud83d\ude0a", "And should be removed from the space ship!", "Yikes.

If they don't then I shouldn't care about their opinion anyway. ;)", "Sounds like it\u2019s OP\u2019s partner that thought the sister would upstage her lol", "Yep. Posted it in the group chat saying \"Here is my dress! This is the one!\" This was long before she showed her unapproved dress.
