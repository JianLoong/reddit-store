My kids are 9 and 5, hers are 8ish and 6, so very similar ages. Which at first seemed great.\n\nThere have definitely always been differences between our families, but nothing major. Next door is a single mother (early 30sish) and shes often drinking, her kids are often not here/at her parents, even on school nights. But I dont know, nor want to know, the whole story. \n\nA few weeks ago my daughter (9) arranged a sleepover next door. I had some reservations but agreed. My daughter has been round their house a few times and all has been fine. And it's just next door. I actually thought it'd be a nice way to see if my daughter could handle sleepovers. (And to be clear I didn't believe she'd drink if she was in charge of the kids). \n\nOn the night of the sleepover, my kid is super excited...and got essentially ghosted. They never came home and when they did it was super late. But fine. I understand life happens. \n\nBut weirdly, next doors mum has given a ton of weird excuses on different occasions for it since. She told her daughter my daughter was ill. She then told my daughter I had said my daughter was ill. She told me she forgot and she told my husband her dad had had a stroke and cut his finger off. \n\nThe same night she said the stroke thing to my husband, she was wasted drunk (with her kids in tow) and ended up having a shouting match with her own parents out the front. She called her dad (who, according to her had recently had a stroke) an arsehole and said she was calling the police on her parents because they didn't want her kids to go into her house with her (presumably because she was wasted). There was other things too, this went on a while. This all happened on the anniversary of a family member of hers death. Which I appreciate is awful but is no reason to treat her own parents like that imo. \n\nAnyway, cut to now. The way she carried on outside my house honestly triggered something in me. I grew up with an alcoholic and at times aggressive father. This affected me badly and I swore a long time ago that energy would never be around my own children. The way she speaks when she's drunk reminds me of my father. And my husband and I made the decision that our daughter would no longer go around their house, nor would her kids come here. I just don't want it. But i still feel like an AH when my daughter asks to go and I don't know how to say no and end up vaguely saying no, sorry, not today. \nI know her children are innocent in this. I feel desperately sorry for them, but I don't want to do any kind of play date situation at all. \n\nAITA? And would I be the AH if I told her exactly why, if she ever decides to ask?", "created_utc": 1689256399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yli8z/aita_for_no_longer_allowing_my_children_to_play/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you for protecting your children from that instability.", "NTA, but couldn't you say they can only play at your house? Sounds like those kids could use some stable adult in their lives.", "NTA - those poor kids!", "Mmm.\n\nWell, let's start with the easy one. I wouldn't let my kids have sleepovers at her house, or otherwise be in her care, at all. Because she doesn't sound like she's competent to look after kids. I don't think she can guarantee my kids' safety.\n\nBut I don't think that's a reason to ban your kids from playing with the neighbors - just to keep it in public / at your house.\n\nSo I suppose that's a partial YTA.", "NTA \n\nFor wanting to keep your kids safe 100% nta.\n\nI would consider if possible having a talk with the persons parents and ask them what is going on. Its possible her own kids are in danger also.", "NTA - for wanting to keep your kids out of it. I agree with other commenters that letting the other kids over might be nice. However I also understand the fear that allowing them over might cause the mother to come over and cause problems. I can only suggest getting an outside camera and recording her behavior in public.\n\nAlso dont stick your head in the sand and ignore her if the kids are suffering. Report that shit.", "Nta. And your kids will appreciate your explanations to them when their older.", "NTA! You can allow her children to play with yours on your property. Yes, they're completely innocent in all of this. No need to make them feel like pariah's because their mother has a drinking problem. I wholeheartedly agree with you that your kids can no longer go over there at all. You're not wrong. Buit every now and then perhaps her kids can enjoy some play time with yours. And yes, you should tell her why you're doing this as it may spark something in her to get her shhhh together! NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nYou are protecting your children and that\u2019s your job.  \nPeople are saying you should have the neighbour kids over at your place even though you have health issues and to that I say no. Not if you don\u2019t want to. You will not be an AH if you don\u2019t have the want nor capability to look after this woman\u2019s children in your home.  \nIt\u2019s not your responsibility. And I know this isn\u2019t the \u201cis this my responsibility\u201d subreddit, but choosing to not stay involved with an unpredictable neighbour is hardly AH territory.  \nYour kid probably does feel a bit sad about it but it\u2019s best to keep some separation I think, certainly for now. Yeah, the neighbour kids are not at fault but your kids come first for you. If you are concerned that the neighbour kids are in danger, then you should report it. But continuing a connection with this woman who is wasted in public with her kids, makes up weird lies to your child, and then has a screaming match outside, is just not a good idea for your family\u2019s safety or honestly your sanity.  \nJust take a step back and keep contact to a polite minimum.", "NTA You are protecting your kids.", "I wonder how you would have felt growing up if all of your friends\u2019 parents kept their kids away from you because of your father.\n\nYou\u2019ve let the kids play together in the past, and presumably your kids have other friends they play with, so this \u201cI can\u2019t watch them since I have chronic illnesses/ dogs\u201d excuse doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Don\u2019t let them go over to her house, fine, but they\u2019re old enough to play in your yard or something for a few hours with low supervision. You also have a husband that could supervise.\n\nThis woman drinks sometimes and had a fight with her parents, not totally abnormal. I feel like you\u2019re projecting your issues with your father on to her without really knowing. Even if she is an alcoholic, how does that make her kids a threat to your children?\n\nYTA. This isn\u2019t \u201cprotecting\u201d your kids, it\u2019s being judgmental of a woman who is struggling and wanting to keep your kids away from those that you view as \u2018less than.\u2019", "YTA\n\nI understand not letting your kids go to her place, but why not let her kids come to yours?", "My dad was like your neighbor.. I wish I had someone's house to go too and escape the fear...", "NTA but as the grandchild of a drunk, explain to your daughter what the issue is. Don\u2019t keep her in the dark.", "NTA, you are absolutely right to listen to those alarm bells! It sounds like the neighbor has people in her life that are also aware of her issues and will be there to step in for her children like they already have. I would not put my children in that line of fire for the sake of \u201cfriends\u201d or even being a \u201csafe place\u201d to the neighbors kids bc that is not going to help in the long term. Being involved with a minor means you should expect to be involved with a parent, those kids cannot be in your lives and just avoid the mess that is their mom. It\u2019s not fair but it does not obligate you to step up for them. Protect your kids from being traumatized and use this as a learning experience. Other comments on books \u201cmy neighbors having a hard time\u201d is great; I think this is also a great conduit for a lesson on why we have to evaluate relationships and how they are healthy for us.", "You\u2019re not the AH for not wanting this woman around your kids. But I do feel for her children in this scenario. You said you grew up with an alcoholic and aggressive father. How would you, as a child, have felt if your friends were no longer allowed to interact with you?\n\nI read your comments that you can\u2019t supervise them at your house because of your health issues. But what about your husband? Unless he\u2019s working 24/7, I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s parenting as well, so there could be a day every other week where he supervises them for a few hours?\n\nUltimately, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting to protect your kids. But I think there\u2019s more complexity around having her kids at your place and it\u2019s worth considering trying different ways to navigate that.", "I mean, they probably could but I probably should have put it in the post, it just didn't seem wholly relevant, I have several chronic illness' and struggle a lot day-to-day. I don't often feel well enough or have the energy to expend on being in charge of other kids that aren't my own. I also have two big dogs that while friendly can be quite jumpy and having other kids over mean I have to keep them in one space.", "This one \n\nIf the kids aren\u2019t the problem, then keep inviting them over to your place \n\nSounds like they need that stable influence more than ever \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility per se - but it would certainly be a good influence on them if you can manage it - show them adults in a non-yelling household \n\nAnd sounds like your daughter misses them\n\nAgree with the partial YTA\n\n(But don\u2019t cave and let your daughter over to theirs) \n\nAlso your daughter is 9? \n\nI think that\u2019s old enough to have a frank, honest, child appropriate conversation \n\n\u201cHoney, I have to be honest and say that as much as I like Ms. A, I can see that she is struggling with a lot of things in her life. \n\nI am very concerned with how she handled the last sleepover plans we had and I would prefer that you stay at our house. Her house might be fun, but I feel more comfortable with you staying at our house/yard because I want to make sure you have access to an adult at all times that you need it.\u201d\n\nI would also emphasize that you don\u2019t blame the kids at all and that she should hold your conversation in confidence \n\nIf you want to have longer conversations later about your own dad and experiences, that is your choice - and I think would be valuable in a few years at least \n\nBut this is a conversation to have at some point - your little girl is growing up and should know that not all adults can necessarily be trusted with her safety \n\nThat sadly affection and trust don\u2019t always go hand-in-hand \n\nAnd she deserves to know why she can\u2019t hang out with her friends \n\nI also recommend reading the book \u201cAfternoon of the Elves\u201d by Janet Taylor Lisle with her \n\nNot as direct comparison to the next door family - but it is one of the few childrens books I can think of that deals with \u201cyour neighbor is struggling with life\u201d from the child\u2019s perspective, and I think would be a good jumping off point for further discussions \n\nGood luck", "I live in the backend of nowhere, so no, other kids generally aren't showing up at my door unannounced. If they're here to play with my kids it's arranged beforehand and quite few and far between. I do not often have other children in my house because of my health issues, less so (because I can put them upstairs if need be, I just don't like to) because of my dogs. That issue isn't reserved for these exact kids. When you're chronically ill and a parent, sometimes it has to be that way, you do the best you can with what you can manage. Your comment is full of you stating things about my life that just aren't true. \n\nMy husband works long hours and isn't home during the day much. Again, you're stating things like this as though they are facts and they're just not. You don't know my life. \n\nI never once said her kids are a threat to my kids, nor did I imply such a thing. I simply want distance between my kids and her, my daughter really as my son doesn't play with them, as I recognise when alcohol makes someone nasty, and I don't want that around my children. Feeling that way doesn't mean I'm projecting my issues, it means I recognise what alcohol can do to someone and use that knowledge to make an informed decision about what I will and won't tolerate around my children. \n\nI never at all even implied I view anyone as 'less than' me. That's a massive reach with zero bearing and you know it. My post also doesn't nearly document everything there is to know about my neighbour and these issues. This is hardly the first or only time things of this nature have happened. But go off about how judgemental I am when you know very very little of the circumstances \ud83d\ude44", "I probably should have put it in the post, it just didn't seem wholly relevant, I have several chronic illness' and struggle a lot day-to-day. I don't often feel well enough or have the energy to expend on being in charge of other kids that aren't my own. I also have two big dogs that while friendly can be quite jumpy and having other kids over mean I have to keep them in one space.", "And yet you're supposed to try and find ways anyway. At this rate you're going to isolate your kid and they'll start to breed resentment.", "I probably should have put it in the post, it just didn't seem wholly relevant, I have several chronic illness' and struggle a lot day-to-day. I don't often feel well enough or have the energy to expend on being in charge of other kids that aren't my own.

Just so your kids don\u2019t think it\u2019s there fault that they can\u2019t see their friends.", "Yeah this is a bit of a reach. Like I would assume the kid has other friends. Also school is a thing, which again, I assume the kids also have friends at. Its a shame the neighbour kids are in the situation they're in, but that doesn't necessarily mean any of them are isolated tbh.", "That is...a lot of assumption. Yes I have disabling health issues and two big dogs, so I can't have an any kid any time policy in my home...but your 'at this rate' comment is wild. My children aren't in any way isolated.", "So when the children played in the past it was always at your neighbor's house?", "Your kid has a friend. As long as the friend isn't detrimental themself, you find a way to make it work.", "I'm not saying you have to be available 24/7 I'm saying you find a way to make it work. Do you have a yard? Is there a park? Free community events where they can do things.\n\nYou want to end a friendship because of their parent. That's AH behaviour and you don't get to decide that for her. By all means don't allow her over at their place as they've proven to be unreliable and you have safety concerns, but otherwise it all sounds like excuses than trying in any meaningful manner to make it work.", "Not 100% of the time, but usually yes.", "It seems like a lot to put on a single, overwhelmed working neighbor, with or without a problem with alcohol.", "It's only ever been my daughter go, my son never has. And always because she's been invited. I haven't just sent her there.", "They can play at your house, not at theirs unless you're there too. Problem solved, no assholes.", "YWBTA if you did let your daughter over there...you don't need to be triggered to recognize that an alcoholic is not someone your kid should be around.", "NTA - keep your children safe, and call CPS if you think your neighbor's children are in danger. Safety before friendship, unfortunately.", "ESH She is AH because of her drinking /behavior. I would not let my kids be at her house. YTA because you could show her kids kindness & how a parent cares for their kids by giving her kids a safe place. Why are you punishing her kids for having a crappy mother & your stopping your kids from playmates?", "Out of curiosity, when you were a kid and suffering due to your father's alcoholism, did your friends' parents bar you from their homes because of your father's behavior?", "All reasonable suggestions, if they didn't just state they have several chronic illnesses and struggle day to day. Do you think community events with extra children is less exhausting than watching them in your home? Taking extra children to the park is less work? If playing in her home is too much for her, how can she do these things? She's not being negligent, she's sick and sounds like she's doing what she can manage. \n\nOr were you suggesting she allow her child to go to these public places and events with the alcoholic mother? Because if so, no - it doesn't matter if they're sober now, speaking from first hand experience, an alcoholic can get drunk ANYWHERE. They're very good at it. Never leave children in the care of an alcoholic. It's not safe.\n\nEdit: realized I sound like I was saying I'm an alcoholic - nah, just my father. Also if I came across as harsh, not my intention.", "But you also don't reciprocate which your neighbor has been willing to accept. That is commendable."]}
