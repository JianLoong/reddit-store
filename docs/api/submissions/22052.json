I majored in aerospace engineering and she majored in art. After graduation I was offered an amazing job as an engineer making $145,000 a year (got extremely lucky and did a year internship at the company prior). With the new job we moved for my job and are renting a home for $3,200 a month which I can afford on my salary alone. My girlfriend hasn\u2019t found an actual job but is hosting art and crafts classes at our local YMCA working average 40 hours a week (lesson planning prep ect ) that brings home around $900 a month. We talked about getting a joint bank account and when I brought up the idea of her getting an actual job she got very defensive and stated we moved here for my job and if she got a normal job her degree would be useless. I kind of felt selfish so I let it go. A month later my co worker was telling me about his wife and how\u2019s she\u2019s an accountant making $50k a year and was wishing she picked a more lucrative career. I agree that is shallow since 50k is above the median income but I couldn\u2019t help to think about my girlfriend making less this $14k a year. I know she can\u2019t get a job making crazy money at this stage but I just wish she would make at least minimum wage to help contribute to the home. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being an ass or if it\u2019s justified that I ask my girlfriend to get a real job despite following her passion.", "created_utc": 1689187452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xwyzq/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_needs_to_get_a/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn\u2019t matter if the girlfriend is working 4 or 40 hours a week \u2014 the problem is she\u2019s not contributing to the household enough because she isn\u2019t making a living wage. If she\u2019s not even making minimum wage at full-time hours, then no, that\u2019s not a \u201creal job.\u201d It\u2019s an exploitative hobby. She couldn\u2019t afford to keep that \u201cjob\u201d if OP wasn\u2019t paving the way. He has every right to not be ok with that. NTA. \n\nShe should put her energy into building a career in an area that interests her. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty she can do that\u2019s still related to her degree, albeit it may require additional education or certification (art teacher, interior design, video game design, graphic design, content creation, user experience design, etc)", "Artist myself here. At 43yrs I am finally making an ok income from my art. I have always had part time or full time jobs to supplement my income. She is an adult and needs to pay bills. I think she also needs to reevaluate the price of her class. I taught children\u2019s recreational art classes and was making $150/ student per month. She could be making much more by expanding or charging more. I still teach paint and sips now and make extra $1500/ month for about 2 nights a week. There are high upfront costs for materials for new classes, but for me they have paid off pretty quickly. (Paintnite is hiring everywhere)", "Info - did the two of you talk about finances before moving out there for your job? What are her career aspirations, and what is she doing to achieve that?", "NAH\n\nShe can only afford to \u201cfollow her passion\u201d because you are providing her the means to do so. It\u2019s selfish to prioritize her own passion over reasonably contributing to your collective finances and future.", "NAH\n\nobviously that wage is pretty much nothing(in America, 14k is like HALF of what is considered a liveable wage, but idk where you are) but she will decide what she does for work.\n\nYou might have to consider if you are okay or not at being the primary provider in a relationship and then do what you will with that information.", "Does she have any plans on doing something else?", "NAH just two people who need to learn to communicate.\n\nNo matter where on the planet you are, there is lodging available for couples at less than $3200 per month. Ideally, before moving the two of you should have talked about expenses, earnings, and expectations along with debt and investment strategies. You didn't, and this is the result.\n\nIt sounds as though you were OK with shouldering the majority of the expense at first and letting your girlfriend pick up whatever random work she wanted provided she relocated to suit your work. Now that you're actually working this plan, you're having second thoughts.\n\nInstead of having a unilateral airing of your thoughts, consider regular money management meetings to ensure you are making progress toward your investment goals and setting aside a big emergency fund. Companies often downsize, restructure, get bought out or go bankrupt and it's usually the employees who get the shaft, so you have to prepare for this by saving and investing. Your girlfriend can't be saving or investing much on her take-home pay. What's the plan if you get sick or injured and can't work? How do you plan to get by?", "You resent your partner. That's not great. Regardless of if her income is or isn't a socially acceptable problem, at the end of the day, you can't build a relationship on resentment.", "NTA, I do think that maybe some conversations probably should have been had a while ago about what her careers plans were, especially before moving for your job.  I don\u2019t blame you for being annoyed if the classes she leads are just for something to do, if there\u2019s some larger plan related to it then it\u2019s a little different. \n\nINFO: did she/does she have a plan for actually making money at some point with her degree? Or does she just like arts and crafts and it\u2019s something to do? Also how is the balance with home care/chores?", "You shouldve had this conversation before you both committed to moving and getting a place together. I think you guys need to have a conversation thay addresses the following: is she happy living in this new area and what does she want long-term.", "No one is an AH here. Tell her to do both. Many people have a primary job while pursuing their passions on the side. Be reasonable.", "INFO why didn't you discuss this before she supposedly uprooted her life for your job? I agree she should try to find something in her industry that pays at least minimum wage, but it seems like neither of you actually know how or want to communicate your wants/needs to the other.", "INFO: did you two discuss this at all before moving?", "what I got out of this is that you want her to get some health insurance.  So you are not planning to ever get married?  At your job can she not be covered, or do you not have health insurance?", "INFO. With regard to split of contributions to the relationship, financial or otherwise: what do you want, what does she want, and what is the current arrangement?", "NTA.  It\u2019s not unreasonable to want your partner to contribute to supporting your joint life.  You aren\u2019t married. She\u2019s not your child.  She\u2019s not entitled to you supporting her so she can follow her passion.", "NTA.  You are subsidizing her passion pursuit, and that really is not fair to you.  And if you are thinking of a future with her, and it sounds like you are, it is not fair for her to expect you to set yourself up for doing that it perpetuity, whether as her boyfriend, her husband, or someone paying her alimony.  It is absolutely OK for you to look out for your financial interests here and ask to be treated fairly.", "First, how is she making below legal minimum wage? She is being massively exploited\n\nSecondly, how would having a \"normal job\" make her degree \"useless?\" Does she think she cant do her art at a \"normal job?\" \n\nNTA overall, just for saying it isnt an \"actual job.\" She's working 40 hours per week, and while she may be happy with what she's doing, if it weren't for you bankrolling her life then she would 100% be homeless. Following your passion is great and all but reality and the necessity of living expenses ARE more important.", "Let me offer a guess: The issue is not how much money she makes. You both will be comfortable on your salary alone, unless you have insane demands for material comfort. Instead you worry that she can't support herself. You don't know if she can because right at this moment she doesn't have to. Therefore, you don't know if she stays with you because she loves you or because she needs a meal ticket. She is probably not thinking in these terms and is excited that she is bringing in any money at all.  But if the doubt has taken root, it's not likely to go away by itself. You both would be more at ease if you both knew for sure that you both could independently support yourselves, ideally each other. Maybe you could discuss the issue with her in practical terms? For instance: 'I'm making good money now, but what if I get in an accident or something?' etc.", "INFO: Did you talk about  financial arrangements while dating in college? Did you talk about them before the move? Do you plan on having children, and if so, does she have interest in being a SAHM?\n\nIt's hard to vote but I am not sure I want to do N-A-H either, because your art major girlfriend very may well have *assumed* that her aerospace engineer boyfriend would be paying the bills and she would be contributing a nominal amount until its time to start a family. Maybe I'm way off base, but I dated some art / theater / art history folks in college, some of them are quite aware they aren't going to have careers in those fields and possibly won't have careers at all. \n\nIf she consistently said she would pursue art as a career in some form (perhaps teaching like she is now) but didn't research how much that would bring in etc, then I could see it being a N-T-A. \n\nEither way, the question you have in front of you my friend, is are you comfortable supporting your partner financially? Your salary will increase and very well may be enough for you and her and some kids. What is she bringing to the table if you're footing the bill? These are all good questions to ask, but I don't think the only option is that she should get a higher paying job.", "NTA - it's one thing if you guys agreed to an arrangement where she stays home and volunteers or something to keep herself busy. With that arrangement, $900/month would be a great bonus! But this isn't what you agreed to, so her essentially glorified volunteering isn't actually contributing to the household. \n\nOne thing - don't compare her to your coworker's wife. Look at her for who she is in the context of your relationship. If this is what makes her happy and you don't *need* the money, and she's contributing in other ways (like housework, grocery shopping, etc) then leave it alone and stop comparing the two.", "Info: Would you be willing to move to a city where your gf would have more/better paid job opportunities in her field even if that meant that you have to get a job outside your field and/or less well paid?", "INFO: what is her field and how much more opportunity would she have to work in it had she stayed in the original city or moved somewhere else?\n\nI keep reading about how you're subsidizing her passion, but if she is giving up all these opportunities, isn't she supporting your career growth at the expense of her own? Unless of course her field always pays nothing, in which case this is a different problem, a financial expectations one.", "You definitely could've been more tactful in your delivery. Financial disagreements are not a small thing to brush over. This is definitely something you two should sit down and discuss your expectations of each other to see if you can come to an agreement.", "NAH\n\nOnly because the context is that y'all were discussing joining finances. Your girlfriend isn't even close to being your financial peer, so you'd be wise not to join any accounts. Frankly, otherwise you seem a bit condescending. Let your girlfriend be responsible for her own career and money, whether you agree with it or not.", "NTA. I live in a small city in Upstate NY and if push ever came to shove, I could make more than that working retail or at a low-level office job. I made roughly $2400 per month at a temp job while I looked for something better.\n\nI took a few advanced art classes in high school and realized that I would never make any money doing that, so I went to college for something different. It is extremely difficult to make any money in that field, and only one person from my high school class ever made money with her degree. She was a photographer for nationally-known magazines.", "NTA.  Tell her no joint account and things are not working out.", "NTA - she seems focused on her arts and crafts and not building a life with you.   Trust me.  Don't co-mingle your finances until there's a committment.", "It is a real job, just not a well paid one. She can look into art teacher at a school If she wants , not just you.", "NTA\n\nDo joint get a joint banking account!!!!\n\n\nKeep all your financials seperate. Forever.", "YTA for ultimately being disingenuous with us, and with her, about your expectations, and honestly . . . just for being an AH.\n\nIn some comments, you try to present yourself as being completely reasonable and supportive, stating that you \"just want her to get a real job, even a low-paying one\" so long as she's contributing to the household. Totally fair, you're such a sweetheart and not asking for much at all, right? She can easily work in her field or an adjacent one if that's what you're talking about. BUT . . . \n\nThen in other comments you flatly contradict that, quantifying a \"real\" job as one that makes at least $30k a year and has health insurance. I've known lots of people who are nearly twice your age who live on significantly less than that. It's not ideal, no, but to be clear, it IS real life, and they are very real jobs, and often fulfilling ones.\n\nBut more importantly, *your expectation isn't really that you just want her to have \"even a low-paying job\" as long as she's contributing to the household*. And you don't care if she's happy. You really ONLY care about her hitting your benchmarks, and that's incredibly unfair and more than a little gross, because yes, you make a lot of money, but you're also working in the field of your choice, one that you find emotionally and professional fulfilling. And yet you are open about the fact that you aren't willing to give her that courtesy if she can't earn much doing work that she finds rewarding.\n\nThe reality is that you happen to work in a field where you got an incredibly high-paying job right out of school, but that isn't realistic for many people. Even $30k with health benefits is UNREALISTIC in some fields, right out of school in your early 20s. And her job satisfaction should be important to you.\n\nSo while it's fine to say that you don't want her de facto volunteering 40 hours a week - that's completely fair - you're a massive, smelly AH for suggesting that if she got a $27k job without benefits (or with partial benefits) doing something in her field that made her incredibly happy, even though your household doesn't need the money at all, you would still find it unacceptable. I honestly don't know if you're a snob or you just value money and a certain standard of living over personal satisfaction, but either way you don't come across well.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect a grown adult to have a job that pays at least minimum wage. At the very least she should still actively be looking for something that pays better. She\u2019s not getting much use out of her degree if it is only bringing in 900 a month anyways, might as well not use it and get paid minimum wage.", "NAH.  First, you should be commended for *stopping and thinking it through* before going off on an angry rant with her.  \n\nShe's not wrong to want to follow her muse.  What she does have to realize is that you are towing most of the freight in your household income.  What does the household maintenance (chores, tidying, decor touches, etc) look like?  Does she put in as much or more than you?  Does she run y'all's social calendar?  These things have value.\n\nYou're not wrong to wonder about the equity of all this.  What you need to do is to ask yourself if you're okay with it.  A lot of guys (*warning -- older generation alert!*) couldn't care less how much the GF earns or doesn't.  Does it change your thinking if you back off from full account integration into having a shared \"household account\" that you both contribute to proportionally, but you also have some separate savings?  What is happening here is not so different from having a stay-at-home spouse, just less formal.\n\nOverall, no AHes here.  Wait until you're both in a serene mood, and talk it through with her.", "NTA because she asked for a joint bank account. You\u2019re subsidising her life man. \nPut it to her this way, how would you \u201cfollow your passion\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for you", "NTA\n\nI have a degree I have never actually used. In fact, currently, I am doing something practically the opposite of my degree. Lots of time, you need A degree to get a job that pays the bills then you use the knowledge you got from the degree as a passion that one day will pay the bills. \n\nMy question for the GF is, if you lost your job how would you guys live? If you break up, what is she going to do? Location hasn't made it impossible to do art. But her inability to start is the problem. \n\nHonestly, you guys need to have a frank discussion and lay out what you both want in life (travel, kids, SAHP, ECT) . If it isn't compatible, you guys should break up now.", "I'm going with an NAH because it really seems like you two are just too young and dumb to have had necessary conversations. It's definitely time to sit down and figure out what you want your life to look like and what you are willing to do - individually and collectively - to get there.\n\nImportant topics:\n\nDoes she expect you to essentially be the sole income for the duration of your lives together?\n\nIs your current lifestyle/quality of life your idea or hers?\n\nDoes she have any long-term plans?\n\nAlong the way, you need to figure out of this resentment you feel towards her is entirely financial in nature, or if you are using the money as microcosm of a larger sense of inequality in your relationship.", "NAH, but you two clearly have different values. I can\u2019t imagine trying to push my partner into getting a shitty job they didn\u2019t want while I could support us, just because I felt some kind of judgmental need for her to make money we didn\u2019t need. Both my wife and I have been sole providers at different points in our lives at far less of a wage than you have. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH necessarily for wanting her to contribute, but it definitely doesn\u2019t seem like you have the same goals/are in the same place in life.", "YTA for telling someone their job isn't real. You're NTA for wanting a partner who can contribute more financially to the relationship. I don't know your life or goals. \n\nBut, there are plenty of relationships where one partner makes more money and is *happy* to support the other's partner unconventional career... This sounds a little bit like a lack of respect/regard for your partner's passions to me. Might want to think about that OP. \n\nINFO: is it a priority for you that whoever you date is able to contribute financially to the household? If yes, then how much should that person contribute?\n\nI think you need to consider what you value in relationships and be clear about that to your partner.\n\nEdit: added judgement", "Passions are great - hobbies are expensive.  None of it pays the bills.  Seems like she's angling to be a SAHM.  She'd have insurance if you just married the girl and had 3 babies with her.  LOL\n\nNTA for wanting something different.  YWBTA if you stayed with this girl when she's not what you really want out of a partner.  Let her go find her passion and you find a partner who's willing to build something with you.", "If your girlfriend did choose a high paying career, would you be amenable to move if she got offered a good job somewhere else?", "NTA.  The whole situation reeks of privilege\u2014mostly on her end. OP I am very curious what she was planning to do if she didn\u2019t have the option of relying on you to pay for her every need. You are getting lots of \u201cadvice\u201d from people saying YTA because you expect your PARTNER to make equal contributions and efforts to the partnership\u2014that doesn\u2019t just mean money. Not sure what stage of your career you are in, but $145K will start seeming like a lot less once you have a few unforeseen medical expenses, taxes, and especially kids if that\u2019s in the plan for you. You are perfectly entitled to not be taken advantage of by your partner and idk if you can understand that that is what\u2019s happening, even if she\u2019s doing it unconsciously. \nYou said in a comment that your passion is video games but it would be selfish/silly of you to drop your actual career to pursue that instead. Why do you say it\u2019s selfish? Because you know that in order to survive in a capitalist hell-scape, especially if you want to thrive and live comfortably, you need a reliable income. $3200 isn\u2019t really that crazy in many major cities for a 2 bedroom. That\u2019s very standard in west LA, New York, DC, SF, etc. Usually that\u2019s partially why higher paying jobs exist in those cities. $3200 is literally less than 4 days of work for me. But if I had a partner who made essentially $0 and didn\u2019t contribute in any other way to the household, and was solely relying on me to pay bills, build savings, put a down payment on a house, pay for pregnancy expenses (esp bc I would be the one who would have to be pregnant too)\u2026bro I\u2019d be OUT. \nI feel like maybe y\u2019all haven\u2019t had this conversation productively yet. But I think you should talk about how she can channel her passion into something that pays her her value and worth. Like idk being an art teacher or working at a museum or something. If you live in the US and you are not trying your hardest to find employment that will cover your health insurance you are delusional and epically going to screw yourself over. It\u2019s sad but that\u2019s the truth", "You just described basically every artist ever. As a couple you are okay financially and you both enjoy your work, so if you love her you will support her in pursuing her career.\n\nDon't get caught up in thinking more money will make you happier.", "NAH \n\nIt\u2019s not like OP\u2019s demanding she find a job outside of her field. He never said that. He just said that maybe she should think of getting a job where she would be able to support herself if god forbid something happens to either him or his high paying job and he\u2019s not wrong! This is really for her benefit more than anything since she\u2019s only bringing home $900 a month. She\u2019s shooting herself in the foot by financially depending on OP so much. I mean, girl needs to do something cause she\u2019s not even bringing home minimum wage. If OP were to lose his job or they were to break up tomorrow she would be financially fucked especially if they live in a city that charges $3200 a month to rent an apartment.", "[deleted]", "Just because you don\u2019t like how much money she earns, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a real job.  So YTA for deriding the work that she does. If you need her to bring in a higher income then that\u2019s worth a conversation, but you sound resentful. Why?", "I don't think anyone here is the AH. But she might need to accept that her degree, in fact, is not worth the paper it was printed on.", "YTA\n\nShe is working 40 hours a week. That's a real job whether you like her pay bracket or not. You don't have children, and you make a six figure income. So why does it matter if she's not making a huge amount of money? \n\nShe's doing what she loves, and also helping out in your community by running art programs at the Y. So yes, YTA for not only trying to devalue her work because of her income, but for trying to force her to stop doing something she loves, not because you need her to financially, but because you just want your household income to be higher.", "Info: are you planning to have kids?\n\nETA: how do you distribute the housework and other home responsibilities?", "She has a real job, though. You said she's working 40 hours a week at the Y.", "YTA. All I need is the headline. She has a job. She is working 40 hours a week. Since she is not bringing in enough to suit you, she needs to get a 'real' job. Do you not see how condescending that is?", "YTA. Your girlfriend is doing important, difficult work that betters her community, you\u2019re making planes go zoom. Society values and rewards one of those things over the other, and you\u2019re falling into the trap of assuming income = importance. Her job is a real job, and sure, she has the privilege of doing it thanks to your support, but your resentment of the arrangement because you don\u2019t view her work as \u201creal\u201d because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have health insurance\u201d is the issue. You also have the privilege of working in a field that doesn\u2019t regularly exploit people by listing full time employees as gig workers so they get out of covering health insurance or providing a 401K. It\u2019s pretty common in non-STEM and/or nonprofit jobs. Also, arguing with people who tell you this in the replies while cherry picking the people who agree with you in the replies isn\u2019t doing you any favors either.\n\nYou also seem weirdly fixated on the healthcare part. But since you live in the US, your girlfriend COULD get health insurance through the state\u2019s insurance marketplace. That\u2019s literally the entire point of the ACA. She\u2019d probably even qualify for Medicaid with that low an income and since you\u2019re not married. Her coverage might suck, but it\u2019s what a lot of people in this \u201cgig\u201d position do. You\u2019re the one choosing to have her get coverage through you and then resenting her for it. This isn\u2019t a new development in your relationship either - she\u2019s ALWAYS been in this field. Did you always resent her for it? Think she was stupid? Assume she would grow up and do something \u201csensible\u201d? \n\nThe tl;dr of this is that you\u2019re providing for her by your own choice and then resenting her for a thing you chose to do. Either stop supporting her or get over yourself.", "Nta\n\nWhere *could* you have moved that her art degree would pay a livable wage?

I majored in aerospace engineering and she majored in art. After graduation I was offered an amazing job as an engineer making $145,000 a year (got extremely lucky and did a year internship at the company prior). With the new job we moved for my job and are renting a home for $3,200 a month which I can afford on my salary alone. My girlfriend hasn\u2019t found an actual job but is hosting art and crafts classes at our local YMCA working average 40 hours a week (lesson planning prep ect ) that brings home around $900 a month. We talked about getting a joint bank account and when I brought up the idea of her getting an actual job she got very defensive and stated we moved here for my job and if she got a normal job her degree would be useless. I kind of felt selfish so I let it go. A month later my co worker was telling me about his wife and how\u2019s she\u2019s an accountant making $50k a year and was wishing she picked a more lucrative career. I agree that is shallow since 50k is above the median income but I couldn\u2019t help to think about my girlfriend making less this $14k a year. I know she can\u2019t get a job making crazy money at this stage but I just wish she would make at least minimum wage to help contribute to the home. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being an ass or if it\u2019s justified that I ask my girlfriend to get a real job despite following her passion.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because of this, you\u2019re going to be funding her life for as long as you guys are together. Congratulations!", "NTA. She cant do what she's doing on the side and make some real money to contribute. \n\nQUestion: Does she aspire to be a SAHM? If not, and the household labor isn't divided accordingly and you are picking up an equal or majority share o household responsibility, you should have a real conversation about her contributing more financially or domestically.", "As you are living together, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect your GF to be employed, that your girlfriend will contribute to shared household expenses in some jointly agreed upon way, and for her employment to support her fulfillment of the agreed upon share. \n\nBeyond that, the rest is up to your girlfriend. The type of work she chooses, the amount of hours she works, the wages she\u2019s comfortable earning, whether insurance is a necessity is her decision, and as long as she\u2019s holding up her end of the bargain, it really isn\u2019t your business. \n\nAll that said, I do think these difference may warrant further examination of your future together. Whether you realize it or not, your comments DO reveal some judgment on your part about what constitutes a career, as well as judgment about how passion should intersect with employment. Your comments also reveal a bit of privileged misunderstanding about earnings, insurance, schedules etc. I think you need to do some soul searching about whether you can truly accept and support your girlfriend if she continues to pursue an arts based career and what it means for the kind of future you can afford together. Will you resent her for continuing to seek employment in what for you feels like \u201cjust a hobby\u201d? Will you come to resent your differences in incomes? If you are committed to making the relationship work, then you and your GF might start talking about the kind of lifestyle you want to be able to afford together (housing? Travel? Kids? Going out to eat?) and begin to evaluate whether that is sustainable given your joint earnings. If not, are you willing to sacrifice that vision? Or does will one or both of you need to increase your earnings? Are there ways you can support your GF in continuing to pursue her passion (art AS a career) but that will also lead to greater financial stability? What is her plan?", "NTA if she\u2019s not making enough that she could afford the expenses of a normal adult life at 40 hours a week then no, she does Not have a real job. \n\nOh it\u2019s work absolutely no doubt, but a job? No. No you get paid for a job. She just have a very time consuming hobby.", "NTA.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about the world today is you practically have to be independently wealthy to be able to pursue artistic dreams. It wasn't always like this. \n\nI was a professional musician for 30 years, during that time I worked in offices and other types of job to, as my roommate used to call it, \"take care of business.\" Your girlfriend isn't taking care of business. At this point you're funding her situation so that she can pursue her dream.\n\nI would suggest telling her to get a teaching certification to become an art teacher and to consider going back to school for art therapy. The more credentialed she is, the more she'll be able to surround her life with her passion.

When I finish school, I\u2019m gonna be making between $70-100k a year, but I told my bf that even if he has a minimum wage job or a part time job, I\u2019d like for him to contribute to the income.

If you don't want to be responsible for that much on your own without assistance from her, tell her that you need to downsize into a smaller place so that you're not shelling out so much money every month. If she doesn't like that idea, she can get a better paying job and help contribute.", "NAH - DO you have the right to be in a relationship were your partner is willing to give up their dream for you and your dream, I guess so. Does your GF deserve a path to work in a field she has passion for, yes. SO both of you are NAH for wanting these things. \n\nBUT, let's put this in some perspective. You knew what her degree was when you met. You also probably knew the prospects for her degree were minimal in the location you moved to and yet you convinced her to move with you to YOUR job, straight out of graduation, giving her NO CHANCE of finding work in her field of study. The fact that she works at the local YMCA, and that you were offered $145K starting, tells me that you are in BUM-FUCK-NOWHERE (Aerospace Engineer here also, so I know the highest paying starting jobs were in the middle of the Fucking Desert. After 5 years. I got the hell out of there and into a metropolitan office as soon as there was an opening). This pretty much means, you fucked her over and now you're complaining that she is working in probably the ONLY place where she can use her degree.\n\nTo be honest, she should have NEVER moved with you. She's probably regretting it. You're going to crush her heart and her dreams, trying to mold her into this image you want. You fell in love with an ARTIST, and you didn't know fully what that meant or what you were getting yourself into, and now you don't want that anymore, I get it, NAH.

You need to either give her that chance, or you need to let her go.", "NTA- looks like you want someone more ambitious and who can contribute more financially in a relationship. Not an asshole for wanting that. You are an asshole for not setting that expectation earlier on.

If she did move for your job then it makes sense to be somewhat accommodating, but if she's making less than minimum wage (and the expectation was that she would be contributing to finances in a meaningful way) then it's definitely time she gets a job.

That's not the same as part time.", "proof of claim. Its not like that where I am. The job market right now is extremely understaffed.", "If walmart hires you as full time you get benefits. I worked there 1.5 years.", "She seems to either be:\n\n1) an independent contractor making $5 an hour\n\nor\n\n2) actually being scheduled and paid for less than 40 hours a week, but OP/his partner count the time she is hanging around or preparing for her work as working time.", "No, they don\u2019t. Only employers with 50+ employees have to offer health insurance.", "If she's full time, they should probably offer health insurance. I'm curious how small this bank is.", "Ok should I be an ass if I caused us to be homeless by quitting my job to pursue my dream of being a musician?", "Sometimes people have to work to make money\u2026she\u2019s lucky she has him to life off of but realistically she should also contribute and not rely on him.", "I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not a job because it\u2019s literally classified as a \u201cgig\u201d meaning they don\u2019t have to provide health insurance ect\u2026.", "Dude, if OP breaks up with her, she's going to be extremely money-focused. Where will she live? Who's paying for food?\n\nShe has a golden ticket here and the only stipulation is pay for your health insurance.", "But she isn't doing those. She's working at the Y for $900/month. She's literally only able to do that because OP is financially supporting her.", "in general you cant have benefits and not be full time. Hes not asking for much here...", "YMCA is an absolutely massive organization. They're definitely over 50 employees.", "YMCA has 80,000+ employees, just slightly over 50.", "You did not major in music. You made the choice to major in something lucrative. In contrast, she majored in art- this was not a surprise for you. All of the moving and living arrangements have been based o. you and your career goals so far. You expect her to build a career, but with what resources? If you\u2019d like her to teach or move to a skilled field, this would take resources. She is also contributing $900/month to the household, which isn\u2019t nothing. Does she help tun the household while you are working-cooking, shopping, etc? Those are important but unpaid jobs. \nFinally, you keep  focusing on health insurance, but if you plan to marry, this is not really an issue. Do you love this person?", ">Sometimes people have to work to make money\n\nYes, but she doesn't. She is contributing some money, and is working a hard job that benefits herself and her community.", "The term these days is \u2018traditional\u2019 job.  Because 2015+ has seen huge emergence of nontraditional jobs\n\nSelf employed people making $100k a year wouldn\u2019t have employer insurance either and those people need to be self insured", "Dude, that's not how it comes across at all. It comes across like you're implying that it's not real work, and I can see why your gf is unhappy if this is how you broach the subject.", "It would free her up to return to where she was.  Remember, they moved away for *his* opportunity, not to facilitate her growth.\n\nThe fact that this move occurred without a clear understanding of his expectations for her is a problem.  It feels like a bait and switch scenario to me.  Though maybe that\u2019s my history speaking.", "She probably wouldn't live away from everyone she knows in a house where the rent is over three thousand dollars, for starters.", "But she only moved there because of OP. If they lived somewhere else she would be able to make more money.", "Each YMCA is run individually. There are thousands of them, it is not just one, over-arching YMCA organization.\n\nSimilar to franchises. If you work at a corporate Burger King, then yeah, they have to offer you insurance if you work 30 hrs per week. But if you work at a franchise one with fewer than 50 employees, they don\u2019t.\n\nSo, no, just because she works for the YMCA doesn\u2019t mean she gets insurance.", "Again, going back to the franchise analogy, those are not all employees of the same organization. Some of them are employed by their larger corporate organization, but OP is (very likely) employed by the individual YMCA that she works for, which may or may not have greater than 50 employees. Probably not though, or they\u2019d be offering her insurance.", "Exactly- she\u2019s living off of him at the moment. Not particularly smart given that she wouldn\u2019t be able to support herself if they broke up. They\u2019re young and not married so she\u2019d be in a hard place if he were to stop paying for her lifestyle. Also hard is relative. And it does benefit her and the community, but how does it benefit him? I think that\u2019s the issue here. Think he\u2019s looking for someone who can pull a little more weight in the relationship financially. He\u2019s at fault for not having the expectations conversation with her earlier.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m just jealous she can give off of that man and do what she wants instead of having to work and provide for myself lol", "Yes, and that sucks. But working a full-time job making significantly less than minimum wage is doing nothing to help their household.", ">Not particularly smart given that she wouldn\u2019t be able to support herself if they broke up.\n\nI mean, she could. She could support herself if she had to... But she doesn't have to. Because her boyfriend offered to pay for everything while she did a job she loved. Sounds very smart to me!\n\n>And it does benefit her and the community, but how does it benefit him? \n\nBy making his partner contented. If I was making way more money than I needed I would hate the thought of my partner working a job they hate to make money we don't need. And I'd love to support them in something that they were passionate about, which brought them joy, even if it didn't make any money. Your partner being happy is always a benefit to you.", "Their household doesn't need help - OP is extremely well off.\n\nAnd she would be able to contribute more to their household income if OP agreed to move a city where she has more opportunities to work in her field even if that meant he couldn't make a six-figure salary in his field anymore. I am pretty sure he wouldn't like that.", "Relying on a guy when you\u2019re this young, unmarried, and have no kids together is not smart. He can leave her at any moment. \n\nI think he is looking for someone more ambitious for a partner. Totally understandable. I always want someone who is as ambitious or more ambitious than me and that\u2019s a quality that I want since I would resent a partner for not pulling his weight in a relationship. That\u2019s just my opinion. Doesn\u2019t seem like he is okay paying for this person for the rest of her life though.", "Regardless, OP wants her to contribute at LEAST a minimum wage job's salary to their household income. If she isn't willing to do even that, that's an issue."]}
