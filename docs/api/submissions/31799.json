I am not the most extraverted person, so I kept the visits from family and friends organised and made sure it wasn't too overwhelming for me or Mia. Needless to say it seems everyone is absolutely in love with our daughter and keep wanting to take pictures with her (I am against of having my child on social media until she can consent to the pictures, they still can take pictures but not post them on social media).\n\nNow to the issue, for the past 3 months their obsession over Mia reached a new level. They keep mentioning how sweet she is and how they would happily eat her as she is just so sweet and I don't find it cute at all, i find it very creepy. I have asked them to stop as I don't feel comfortable with it, but I was told I am overexaggerating.\n\nThis has came down to a boil 2 days ago when my sister in law \"Anna\" came around to visit and started showing me a video of a woman jokingly putting her child's foot between 2 slices of bread and pretending she is about to eat it. Anna said that's what she feels like doing when she sees Mia as she is so sweet and adorable, but I have just called her creepy. I have raised my voice and said I am not comfortable with the way they talk about Mia as it seems obsessive and very cringy and if she carries on she or other in laws are no longer welcome to our house.\n\nAnna got annoyed and left and I have received a lot of calls from my MIL and family friends calling me an asshole for calling them creepy and inappropriate as well as saying it is normal and I'm reacting this way as Mia is my first born child, while all of them already have multiple children.\n\nMy husband and my parents are on my side as they find it weird, but I want to have a second opinion.\n\nEdit: reading some of the comments and want to address a few points. This is incredibly unusual and weird to me as neither me and my younger siblings nor my husband and his siblings were raised with such phrases being common, so my husband is also weirded out by this.\n\nEven my friends who were present when SIL was around found it weird and off putting since it is constant and I have expressed multiple times how uncomfortable me and my husband are when Mia is compared to food. I get calling a child sweety or using the term like buns, but in my in-laws case this is nearly constant, on top of saying how sweet Mia smells when she clearly needs a diaper change.", "created_utc": 1701029164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184jeux/aita_for_calling_my_sil_and_some_family_friends/", "score": 1050, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like many people have said, it's a very common saying and they probably don't mean your child any actual harm.

I mean, if several people have been telling you that for several months on end, I get the unease. \n\nYou should probably apologise for using the term creepy and just politely say that the comment just doesn't work for you.

The baby is also their family, part of their brother and son which they just want to cherish.

They think your child is cute and they have a specific way of saying so.  However, you (and me) find it creepy, and don't like how they are expressing it.  You are fully within your rights to say to them \"Hey, I find what you're saying creepy and it squicks me out.  Could you express yourself differently around me, please?\"  It's not wrong to have boundaries.  They are also not wrong for expressing their adoration in the way that they choose; but if you make it clear to them that you don't like that particular turn of phrase, I would consider them to be in the wrong.

Yeah you can have boundaries etc but sometimes certain boundaries make you an asshole, like you could say \u2018you\u2019re not allowed to use any words containing the letter \u2018e\u2019 around my child\u2019 and legally you\u2019re allowed to say/do that but in general human society it\u2019s ridiculous and you\u2019re being an ass.

Are any of these people cannibals who will literally eat your child? If the answer is no, then you have no real fear here.\n\nSecondly, this is not something I'd deem \"creepy\". That term should be reserved for the people who sexualize infants or give gifts labeling their sexuality/gender expectations from birth on (ie \"heartbreaker\" shirts or \"why is your son wearing purple that's not a MAN color\"). Creepy is like that video of a dad that pulled his infant daughter's legs back together because \"she was being suggestive to others by spreading her legs\" \ud83e\udd22 THAT'S creepy behavior.\n\nThirdly, it's perfectly normal to be weirded out by the endearments some people choose to use over a child they love. Some people use really weird shit to express their feelings. For me, the two pieces of bread thing is a little over the top weird, but also likely just a \"for the lolz\" video and I can see it as such. Your SIL also likely thought it was funny and thought it'd be amusing to pretend to share the same \"impulses\" that this other person did, and was likely embarrassed at your reaction to it because she meant no harm.\n\nFourthly, I myself randomly have the urge to give my kids \"love bites\". I'll grab their hand and gently \"gnaw\" on their forearms, or if they're grabbing some chips from a bag I'm eating out of I'll snatch their hands and \"chew\" on their fingers like a dog over a dog bowl, or when I'm snuggling them I'll sometimes pull my lips over my teeth and \"gum\" their hair or their ears. It's all in good fun and clearly teasing but for some reason as their mom I just wanna \"eat them up\".\n\nI don't think I'd do this to someone else's child (although niblings...I might do the \"gumming\" thing to their little toes. I'll have to get back to you on that one), and if the parents found it weird or uncomfortable I'd definitely refrain from doing it.\n\nSo I'm gonna say NAH with a leaning towards Y-T-A. Everyone has different ways to show endearment, and I think you're overreacting in this case. Instead of telling them it's creepy, tell them it's weird. Because it IS weird lol, even if it's a term that's been used to describe babies for decades. The problem is that you're making it into something it's not, and they're not stopping something that makes you uncomfortable.\n\nHave a real conversation with them about it instead of making it weird by insulting them. That just makes them defensive and makes you look like the bad guy.", "I tell my daughter that I\u2019m going to eat her toes. \n\nSpoiler alert, I\u2019m not a creep and I\u2019m not going to eat her toes. \n\nYTA", " Sounds like you just have some childhood trauma girl.

I am not the most extraverted person, so I kept the visits from family and friends organised and made sure it wasn't too overwhelming for me or Mia. Needless to say it seems everyone is absolutely in love with our daughter and keep wanting to take pictures with her (I am against of having my child on social media until she can consent to the pictures, they still can take pictures but not post them on social media).\n\nNow to the issue, for the past 3 months their obsession over Mia reached a new level. They keep mentioning how sweet she is and how they would happily eat her as she is just so sweet and I don't find it cute at all, i find it very creepy. I have asked them to stop as I don't feel comfortable with it, but I was told I am overexaggerating.\n\nThis has came down to a boil 2 days ago when my sister in law \"Anna\" came around to visit and started showing me a video of a woman jokingly putting her child's foot between 2 slices of bread and pretending she is about to eat it. Anna said that's what she feels like doing when she sees Mia as she is so sweet and adorable, but I have just called her creepy. I have raised my voice and said I am not comfortable with the way they talk about Mia as it seems obsessive and very cringy and if she carries on she or other in laws are no longer welcome to our house.\n\nAnna got annoyed and left and I have received a lot of calls from my MIL and family friends calling me an asshole for calling them creepy and inappropriate as well as saying it is normal and I'm reacting this way as Mia is my first born child, while all of them already have multiple children.\n\nMy husband and my parents are on my side as they find it weird, but I want to have a second opinion.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s just a good thing to keep pictures of your kids off the internet because you never know who will see them. People who do post them are not bad parents, just as people who choose to not post them are also not bad parents. You are the one making this whole thing into something it\u2019s not by calling OP an asshole because she chooses to wait for her children\u2019s consent", "Only takes one pervert to see a pic and give access to the pic to every pervert that has access to the internet.  \nPerverts don\u2019t always turn out to be strangers and not everyone on your friends list is really your friend.\n\nWhat are you talking about minuscule?  \nOne time is too many.    \nOne time is unnecessary.   \nThat decision should be up to the parent.  \nNo one care what you personally think.  \nDo what you will as a parent and people won\u2019t say a thing about it.  \nRespect others.", "Strange hill to choose.", "\"you can't come in my house unless you meet my condition\" is a textbook boundary. Since it's apparent you don't know what the word means this conversation is over.", "Fair enough, that's your opinion though I'd say most would find it cute as you can see in the comments here or IRL", "So I\u2019m mentally ill for agreeing people shouldn\u2019t joke about eating a baby? Lmao okay troll", "OP is definitely a damn clown for carrying on about this super common phrase of affection towards her daughter.\n\nPretty psychotic to call the family \"obsessive\" over that.", "I mean I don\u2019t consider that the full context at all lol I\u2019d very interested to see these interactions because they could come off incredibly differently in person.", "We live in a modern society and we should not be using archaic phrases whatsoever. Especially if they are creepy to modern ears. I can\u2019t believe you would advocate for this disgusting behavior", "Was that the one where the mom insisted her daughter was ugly? \n\nIf so, I think that's not really comparable to this. Here op is just saying she doesn't want her daughter to be compared to food. In that post the mom was saying nobody could call her daughter beautiful or compliment her ever.", "Sometimes, those set conditions are absolutely ridiculous and should be called out as such.", "Yes, glad you're starting to get it.\n\nGo to a hospital already", "When people say that, they don't mean they literally want to feast upon the baby's flesh", "Yeah I think it\u2019s a super weird thing to say as well, but I don\u2019t honestly think anyone *actually* will eat the object of the statement", "Or maybe they can respect that she doesn't like it and quit doing it. It costs 0 bucks to be respectful", "It's weird you say \"we live in a modern society\" and then use it to reference being against something that is very much a part of modern society. Most people don't find it creepy. That's like... the entire point. It's not disgusting behaviour. We can discuss it in terms of boundaries and if OP's family should stop regardless because OP is uncomfortable with it, but the phrase itself and its usage isn't creepy or \"disgusting behaviour.\" Save that rhetoric for something actually problematic.", "Did you seriously start your argument with \"we live in a society\"?", "Yep", "I don't think that's a risk here.", "And if she decides making eye contact with the baby is obsessive? They stop that too?"]}
