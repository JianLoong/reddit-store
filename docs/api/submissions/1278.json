Know when to stop.", "Yes YTA Teasing and making fun of each other as a joke... you sure it was a joke to her, seems the way she reacted it wasn't that way to her. You might be a bit of a bully. \nLike she started crying and you just kept going? Then you call her a crybaby and don't feel bad for making fun of her.", "YTA, ESH, you didn't explain what comments you passed. Imagine if you were crying and everyone poked more fun at you. You wouldn't feel very nice about it.If she cried, it means y'all crossed boundaries. I am 16(F) and some of y'all boys are ruthless, apologise to her if you can, or else be ready to lose friends for your shitty behaviour.", "YTA. Why would you keep making fun of her once she\u2019s crying? It\u2019s not a joke anymore if she\u2019s not laughing, you\u2019re just being cruel. Even in this post the way you\u2019re invalidating her feelings, and calling her a cry baby, you didn\u2019t even try to hear her out, or take a second to try to make her feel better or apologize. You\u2019re a massive AH, try to work on developing some empathy", "YTA you're all bullies and you obviously crossed a line with her with what you said if she usualy doesnt mind it. Apologies and hope she forgives you.", "YTA - she was crying and you kept going. You\u2019re not a supportive friend group for not asking how you took it too far. Lines can be crossed even if that\u2019s the dynamic of the friend group.", "Stanly Amanda told me your sorry ass was here trying to make yourself look like a victim when you made racist comments towards elysia and even called her a dog eater and made fun of her when her dad was in the ICU get a reality check and bffr"]}
