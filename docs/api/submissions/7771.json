{"id": 7771, "submission_id": "10gc9pm", "title": "AITA for making a joke about my wife's parents and grandparents?", "selftext": "Obligatory on throwaway and on mobile.\n\nMy wife (Anna) lost both her parents in middle school and after that was raised by her maternal grandparents until she went to college. Anna was an only child and her parents didn't have siblings either. None of her grandparents are living at this point either.\n\nWe've been married 3 years and she rarely talks about her family. I on the other hand have a huge family with 16 neices and nephews. Naturally, we spend all holidays, birthdays, and celebrations with my family. Which works great as they all love Anna, and she loves them back.\n\nRecently we had dinner with another couple we're close to, Kyle and Lisa. They were talking about how deciding who's family to see and when is such a challenge and no matter who they spend time with they feel like the other family constantly guilt trips them. The conversation was definitely bringing the mood down as Kyle and Lisa both looked stressed. I thought I'd try to lighten the mood a bit and said they should have just done like me and marry someone who's parents and grandparents are all dead so there's never any argument over who to visit. I was trying to make a dumb joke to make everyone smile but it backfired. Kyle kind of got it and said, good tip I'll keep that in mind for next time. Anna practically ran out of the restaurant, Lisa followed Anna and called me and Kyle both jackasses as she left. Lisa also later texted us both she's staying at the house with Anna for the night and suggested I either sleep on the couch at her and Kyle's place or get a hotel for a few days.\n\nI wasn't trying to offend anyone or upset Anna, my intent was to lighten up a tense atmosphere and give everyone a laugh. Now, Anna won't speak to me or respond to my texts, Lisa is the most pissed off I've ever seen her, and Kyle is the only one who sees any humor in my joke but still wants me to apologize to Anna and find a way to make it up to her.", "created_utc": 1674160091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gc9pm/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_wifes_parents_and/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course, YTA. \n\nYour wife should\u2019ve joked back and said, \u201cHey, you should do like me and leave the marriage so there\u2019s never any argument over who to visit.\u201d", "What the actual fuck is the matter with you? \n\nHow the fuck is joking about dead family members gonna lighten the mood? \n\nAnd how the fuck do you not understand that you hurt your wife's feelings and you need to apologize, whether you still think your stupid little joke was funny or not. \n\nYTA", "She gets to make dead parent jokes, because they are her dead parents. You do not. That simple.\n\nYta", "Yeah big YTA here.   There's things that are off limits for jokes, and dead parents/grandparents are a big one.  \n\nA better way of handling it it would have been to say \"I wish we had that problem, I would have loved to have known Anna's parents and grandparents.\"    You might start apologizing and groveling with that.", "I'm not sure why you're even asking because the answer was obvious the moment your wife ran out of the restaurant. That WAS your answer.\n\n**YTA**\n\n>I wasn't trying to offend anyone or upset Anna, my intent was to lighten up a tense atmosphere and give everyone a laugh.\n\nBut your intent doesn't matter. In fact, that you're still defending what you did, and coming to a Reddit sub full of strangers looking for validation is exactly what makes you an AH. That and the fact that you've been married to your wife for three years, and I assume in a relationship for at least a while longer than that and . . . *you don't know her at all.*\n\nAnd really, that's the crucial bit at the heart of this. You don't mention your age, but you've been married for three years, so I'm assuming (and you can correct me if I'm wrong) that you're not, like, 18. In other words: you're probably old enough to think before you make a really tricky, potentially hurtful joke, and consider whether your wife is the sort of person who would find it funny or not.  And you've known her long enough that you should have a sense of her feelings around this HUGE LOSS of all the parental figures in her life and how she copes with that - does she normally do that with humour, or is it a touchy, painful subject?  \n\nBut you got it completely, totally wrong. Which tends to imply one of three things: Either 1) you don't pay attention to how she feels about this hugely significant loss, 2) you've never asked her about it at all, or 3) you're indifferent to how she feels about it. And none of those says great things about you.\n\nLook, I've already gone on too long, but TL;DR: **YTA** for making a joke at the expense of an incredibly personal, seemingly deeply painful part of your wife's life without being 100% sure that it was something she likes to joke about. That's just not okay.", "your horrible \"joke\" didn't go over as planned and upset your wife this much and you STILL HAVEN'T APOLOGIZED?\n\nYTA YTA YTA holy shit what the hell is wrong with you?!?", "YTA Whats funny about it? How is her family all being dead a punchline?", "YTA. Obviously, if Anna doesn\u2019t have any living relatives, she is heartbroken already. You making fun of this just makes it so much worse.\n\nYTA even twice actually if you still haven\u2019t apologized and are here on Reddit to check if you actually screwed up or if she was actually wrong instead.\n\nYou really need to make up for it.", "YTA.\n\nI'm sorry for this, but...imagine losing your entire lovely family, including those 16 nieces and nephews. \n\nThat's what you did to Anna with that joke.", "Lmao no way this is a serious post! Obviously YTA", "YTA.  Even if you were in the same position, where everyone you loved who was primarily involved in your care as a child was dead - this would still be a very inappropriate joke, and I've got a reasonably dark sense of humour.  She doesn't talk about her family much, it's probably because she's still got trauma about it.  The fact that you've STILL got a big family adds a whole other layer of AH-ness to it - you have absolutely no idea what it's like to feel that alone in the world.", "Uh\u2026 do you actually need us to tell you how much you\u2019re an asshole?  I\u2019m not sure what concerns me more, the fact that you made the joke or that you have to post here because you\u2019re not sure you did anything wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have any idea what it\u2019s like to lose your mom or dad\u2026 or both.  In middle school too, holy shit that\u2019s horrific.  I can\u2019t imagine the circumstances were great either, as they both died unnaturally young in the same timeframe.  But do your best.  Think about the kind of lifelong trauma that creates.  Now imagine your partner not only bottling that into a heartless joke, but spewing it out over dinner at friends in front of her.  She was shocked, unsurprisingly ran out crying in front of her friends and everyone else in the restaurant, all because of something her own spouse said to her.  She got betrayed by the closest person she has.  Not like she has parents!  LOL!  (Spoiler:  It\u2019s not very lol)\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to tell you.  Obligatory YTA.  Did you need me to tell you though?  Oh and seriously, your marriage is rightfully in jeopardy.  Give her all the space she needs, and when you\u2019re both ready, give her an apology that shows that you can only begin to understand the impact of the absolutely horrible thing you said.", "I wish you and Kyle the best of luck in your second marriages. Learn from your mistakes boys.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. That is so completely insensitive, what the hell is wrong with you?", "YTA what the actual fuck", "YTA. You \"joked\" about your wife's entire biological family being dead. How do you even remotely think you're not TA here?", "YTA you made light of the fact that everyone she has ever loved in life is dead! What is wrong with you? And that you're grateful for it because it makes your life easier? Those are probably the most painful things she has EVER gone through and you laughed, then tried to share it as a joke in public?! Would you like it if every single one of your family members died only to have your significant other find it funny and laugh at your pain, in public, with friends? You FUCKED up. She might actually leave you for this and the blame would be solely yours.", "YTA. Can\u2019t even comprehend how you thought that was an okay thing to say.", "How would you think saying something like that would lighten the mood? That's just cold man. She has no parents or grandparents left here and you treated it like a joke. Her loved losses were used as a punchline in a really shitty point for you. Jimmy cricket you are the apple that fell far from the tree.\n\nMassive YTA\n\nEdit: Kyle is trying to be your friend which is why he is saying you need to apologize and try to make this up to Anna. It's not that he agrees with your \"joke\" or finds humor in it, it's that he knows what you were trying to do but you blew it all to hell. He is trying to tell you take accountability for what you had said and do what you need to do to fix the mess you had made. He is stuck in an awkward position and wants this to just be over as much as you do at this point. His wife is fairly pissed towards and disgusted by your words, which would probably cause a slight rift for Kyle at home. \n\nIf you really love Anna, then you should start by taking full accountability for being a total jackass at her expense. Admit that what you said wasn't right on any level (you have to truly be sorry though for this to actually matter).  Don't hide behind the fact that you were \"trying to lighten the mood\". Take full accountability for what happened and focus on what you did that was wrong. That is how you start to mend the rift you had caused. Take responsibility and accountability for the pain you have caused Anna. Nobody else did that to Anna- you did this all on your own.", "YTA\n\nGood luck finding a 2nd wife without family, hopefully this one is filling for divorce. Just learn from your mistake and don't make the same joke.", "YTA. She doesn't talk about her family because it is soul crushing to not have one, let alone to be with someone with a big loving family. I am sure that DAILY and definitely at every single one of your family gatherings she sits there wishing she had that kind of family and wonders what that kind of love and connection feels like.", "Did you seriously need to ask this question?", "YTA. You should be ashamed of yourself", "YTA in the hugest way possible. I have no living family and we always spend holidays with my wife's family, but she would never say something like that.", "YTA - wtf is wrong with you???", "YTA you have a whole family to rely on meanwhile she has no one but you, yet you decide to make a \"joke\" about her dead family.\n\nAs someone who has lost most of my family members you are a huge asshole, what was the punchline OP?", "Based on her reaction, YTA. Clearly this is not something you guys joke about often.", "YTA - That was just cruel", "YTA!  You may not have experienced a loss like that before, but have some empathy!  That kind of loss is devestating, and never something to joke about, in any context.  Hope you don't end up divorced over your little \"joke\".  Get down on your knees, and start kissing some serious butt, IF she gives you the chance to.", "dude, you are SOOO much the AH! i am 55 years old. my parents died when i was 13, (dad) and 17 (mom). while i do have older siblings, making a joke about some one's loss is NEVER funny! they died in 1982 and 1985 and i am STILL a little sensitive about them leaving me!", "YTA.\n\nHow did you really think that was a joke? That wasn\u2019t a joke, that was mocking.

How would you like to apologize? Make it good.", "YTA. I get that you were trying to be funny, but you weren\u2019t. You hurt your wife with your tasteless joke and you need to stand up, take responsibility for it, and apologize to her sincerely. Immediately.", "YTA tremendously, my friend. You done goofed. Prepare to grovel a lot and never joke again. Or prepare for a divorce, I won't be surprised if that's going to be a deal breaker for Anna.", "YTA. It\u2019s not funny to joke about your wife\u2019s dead parents. Wtf.", "YTA easily. \n\nNot necessarily for the joke itself (it was really in poor taste) but the inability to realize you made a poor joke that hurt versus adding humor and failing to apologize versus acting dumb like you don\u2019t know what happened and refusing to admit you made a terrible joke. \n\nI\u2019m beginning to hate AITA jokesters because they seem so dense and unable to admit doing harm with a terrible joke.", "YTA \n\nAND the fact you are even asking this means your not JUST an asshole. \n\nYou owe your wife a huge apology, you also need to take a look at yourself for going forward. \n\nYou are privileged in a way your wife is not and you essentially rubbed that in her face while making her loss the but of your joke. Completely out of line, insensitive and inconsiderate.", "YTA. What the fuck were you thinking? Jokes about dead people to lighten the mood? Disgusting.", "YTA - A joke is only funny if everyone is laughing, and you should have been smart enough to realize that your wife will NEVER find the deaths of her parents and grandparents funny. \n\nIt doesn't matter what your intention was, that was a truly terrible thing to say and you need to learn how to ask yourself three questions before making comments in the future: is it true, is it necessary, and is it kind.

I am so sorry for your wife that she is with someone who could ever think that joking about all the family she has being gone. Don\u2019t be surprised if you hear from a divorce lawyer at this point. You obviously have never lost anyone close to you. Let me tell you, it is a pain that never goes away. I have lost all my grandparents and lost my dad last year to a freak ranching accident. I still fall into a sobbing mess anytime I think of them. You are a huge AH. I would ask what you were thinking but it\u2019s so obvious you weren\u2019t.", "YTA. That was such a rude and privileged thing to say. I'm sure your wife wishes her family were still here.

Somehow, you tried to find a joke in all that?!?!?!", "YTA, but my guess is if that joke requires 3 days away instead of a heartfelt apology, she has another reason to not want the apology right now. Like you haven't been good about them before, or she has tried to shut down jokes at her expense and this was the last straw.", "YTA. Whether you realize it or not, you actually brought the mood down further because you never joke about someone's dead family members.

Anna was an only child and her parents didn't have siblings either. None of her grandparents are living at this point either.\n\nWe've been married 3 years and she rarely talks about her family. I on the other hand have a huge family with 16 neices and nephews. Naturally, we spend all holidays, birthdays, and celebrations with my family. Which works great as they all love Anna, and she loves them back.\n\nRecently we had dinner with another couple we're close to, Kyle and Lisa. They were talking about how deciding who's family to see and when is such a challenge and no matter who they spend time with they feel like the other family constantly guilt trips them. The conversation was definitely bringing the mood down as Kyle and Lisa both looked stressed. I thought I'd try to lighten the mood a bit and said they should have just done like me and marry someone who's parents and grandparents are all dead so there's never any argument over who to visit. I was trying to make a dumb joke to make everyone smile but it backfired. Kyle kind of got it and said, good tip I'll keep that in mind for next time. Anna practically ran out of the restaurant, Lisa followed Anna and called me and Kyle both jackasses as she left. Lisa also later texted us both she's staying at the house with Anna for the night and suggested I either sleep on the couch at her and Kyle's place or get a hotel for a few days.\n\nI wasn't trying to offend anyone or upset Anna, my intent was to lighten up a tense atmosphere and give everyone a laugh. Now, Anna won't speak to me or respond to my texts, Lisa is the most pissed off I've ever seen her, and Kyle is the only one who sees any humor in my joke but still wants me to apologize to Anna and find a way to make it up to her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
