Your husband is TA for punishing his kid for his ex's actions. His ex sucks, at least as far as this story indicates. Also you are TA for doing something that not only is deeply invasive of your husband's privacy, but also may have consequences for your child, because there's no telling what will be done with that data after the DNA test, or what the consequences will be for your family if it comes back positive (or inconclusive).", "Yta.

(2) For (possibly) using your minor child to do it, and exposing his DNA (or maybe, hers) to some insecure commercial data base without your kid's knowledgeable consent.  (If your kid is over 18 and consents, this doesn't apply).  \n\nA court can order paternity testing if warranted by the circumstances.  I would suggest you stay out of it if you don't want a lot of conflict with your children's father in the future.   \n\nHowever if you think he might have committed serious crimes that deserve to be brought to light, maybe you should do it.  Just be sure you know what you're risking.", "INFO: are they asking for a medical test, or are they trying to get you to send his info to a private company like 23andme to test? You would *definitely* be an a-hole if you used a private company regardless of the rest.", "Not sure.
