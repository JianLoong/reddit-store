(If your kid is over 18 and consents, this doesn't apply).  \n\nA court can order paternity testing if warranted by the circumstances.  I would suggest you stay out of it if you don't want a lot of conflict with your children's father in the future.   \n\nHowever if you think he might have committed serious crimes that deserve to be brought to light, maybe you should do it.  Just be sure you know what you're risking.", "INFO: are they asking for a medical test, or are they trying to get you to send his info to a private company like 23andme to test?

This guy needs to face responsibility if he is the dad.", "NTA. But you might want to cover your butt to make sure this decision cannot legally bite you in the rear. Perhaps speak to a lawyer. Usually the court will step in and order a paternity test. \n\nMaybe a loophole, I don\u2019t know if this is a good idea or not so take this with a grain of salt - perhaps do one of the 23 and me tests, and have that child\u2019s mother do the same. The results should show if they\u2019re related. It\u2019s such a normal thing now to take one of those, and they\u2019re easily available.", "NTA.

And depending on the custody order for the children OP and ex share, and decision making rights, and the judge that hears a potential contempt hearing, a DNA test without both parents consent could be problematic.  OP should either not do the test or consult a family attorney before proceeding.", "People can voluntarily give a DNA sample of themselves. There are no laws that I've ever seen that would make that illegal.", "I'm not sure if both parents need to give consent? Would be my worry. And tbh, the way the post reads, I was having trouble understanding which kids were being tested. And what's happening is essentially the police waiting for your garbage to collect your DNA. Yes its legal, but a lot of people don't know that. So please, stop trying to lecture me. I'm not stupid. Just giving OP the advice she really needs, which is that of an attorneys, and not idiots and trolls from reddit.", "No. Only the custodial parent would need to give consent. \n\nThere are plenty of people that can give educated advice other than attorneys.

Seriously get off your high horse.", "Depends on the state of residence.  Custodial parents, if the state even recognizes that term, do not automatically have unilateral decision making rights.

While your Ex is alive and can express his opinion over the situation, they can go through the courts to compel him to get tested (I think). As rough as it is on the other child, you have to look out for your child's interests, and this will probably hurt his relationship with his father, and yours with him, making it harder to coparent.", "YTA.

There\u2019s no reason not to help.  Also, based on everything I\u2019ve read, when someone has support orders for other kids they do not reduce those orders just because there is another, it\u2019s based on income.  And he just has to pick up more work and maybe stop having kids with people if he can\u2019t, or won\u2019t support them.

Say that ex is paying 22% of his income to Child 1, that wouldn\u2019t change if he needed to start paying child support for Child 2, Child 2 would just get less child support allotted to them. Subsequent children don\u2019t affect the ones who came earlier re: amount owed for child support.", "They also take the ex's salary into consideration for each group of children.", "He's avoiding the DNA test so he can avoid CS. It's a scummy thing to do. Going around him so that he's forced to pay child support is the morally correct move here. \n\nNTA.", "Soft ESH I say that because you waited until now to do the right thing.

Next you\u2019ll have your child benefit cut.", "[deleted]", "I'm on the fence, I'd say NTA for helping another kid, but you're basically handing over your kids DNA test result over to someone and you're not sure why.\n\nHave you considered what will happen with the DNA results after they're done with it?

So if Child 1 is owed 22%, the next child would get their percentage based off X% of the remaining 78% of his income in the US. OP has clarified that she\u2019s in Canada, which according to what I\u2019ve seen on legal aid/lawyers\u2019 websites, would base subsequent children\u2019s support based on income left after the obligation to earlier children is paid.", "it can, and also often does, trigger a dude to just stop paying any child support at all. a family that was friends of mine got a divorce and the father was paying child support for his kids. then he got another woman pregnant (someone random i guess) and was sued for support. he moved across the country and just started working under the table jobs and ghosted everyone.", "Your shifty. It's am unsure how this is your kid or your business. He doesn't want to do it and if you do, you'll be calling him a ex too", "NTA. But why are you raising kids with this man?

He has 9 confirmed kids and about 6 potentials. Every time I've been asked I willingly do it then wish her the best of luck finding him to collect child support. He's the \"get a woman pregnant then pull a Houdini and disappear\" trick type of guy.", "Be careful. I don\u2019t recommend going behind your ex\u2019s back about this. You know nothing about this person, their intentions, or their motivation. What you do know is that they are not against going behind anyone\u2019s back to get what they want. You are making a choice for your whole family here, including your son who might later think he has a right to control who has his DNA. Being pulled into other people\u2019s drama is rarely without personal consequences. BTW, your ex was probably fairly traumatized by his other ex\u2019s behavior.", "Gonna say YTA....

This through the side door test of a different kid, rather than a court order to the putative father doesn't sound like a government agnecy's approach.\n\n(BTW, testing your kid against the other kid **proves** nothing about whether your husband is the other kids' parent or even if he is your kid's parent.)", "Exactly", "I think I must have misunderstood your post?", "OP really hasn't made this clear but then does this random person have any right to ask for the DNA test?", "and what is he\u2019s not? There\u2019s a reason he isn\u2019t paying for that child and is not on the birth certificate. When you get the dna test back who gets the results exactly and will they be truthful? There\u2019s just something not right about it to me. Wait for the children to react the age where they can consent to what they would like to happen instead of deciding for them. Plus she can\u2019t decide this on her own as she has joint custody of the kids with her ex.", "That is not true in NC. The 22% would be allocated equally amongst all children. Know for a fact since my husbands ex tried to get more child support from him and we were expecting our first child.", "None of what you're saying is correct.", "If it is on a voluntary basis, you always have a right to ask. There is just no mechanism to compel them if they say no.", "If he's not, there's no harm done. What you're suggesting would make it so they possibly miss out on growing up with that brother. The reason he isn't paying could be simply because he's avoiding it - as people often try to do with child support.  \n\n\nAnd she CAN certainly decide this on her own if she's the primary parent. As OP stated in a comment above, it's a medical test, and she has every right to consent. Likely, all the child will have to do is spit in a tube.", "Well then why hasn\u2019t she gotten a court ordered paternity test? Why is she going through op instead of the courts? Where she could get backdated child support? It doesn\u2019t make sense. This should be done lawfully through the family courts at best. Not with an at home dna kit.", "Well, OP isn't in the US, so things might be different where she's at. But my guess is that this was a sure and cheaper route. There might be more than one potential father in the mix, so why not test a sibling first before going through the courts and having to force the potential father to test? That's much more cost effective. Once they have the right guy, they'll probably go through the courts for back child support, etc. \n\nAnd again - OP has stated this isn't some home dna kit. It's going through an actual lab.", "I didn't say it was common knowledge. You weren't being helpful. You were offering bad advice on a subject you know nothing about. \n\nYou should have just not responded. But you're too important in your own mind not to. Perhaps you should hang out on the 'am I the main character' sub. Smooches!", "Okay then. Find a law in any state that says the primary (or what ever term you wish to use) parent would suffer legal consequences for voluntarily providing DNA samples in this case. State the case law or general statue to back it up. \n\nI'll wait.", "Do the research yourself.
