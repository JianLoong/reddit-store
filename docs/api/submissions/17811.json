There is a more overlying issue your wife is dealing with that makes her equate a hug between two brothers to a romantic kiss between the two. She is equating every physical touch between family members to essentially incest - I think most people would be extremely uncomfortable observing their loved ones *actually* being incestual with one another - so I believe her feelings are absolutely real. Growing up being taught that touching your family is extremely inappropriate **has** to be damaging to one's mental well-being. For your wife, it's damaging her to the point that it's causing friction in her marriage. It's possible she is thinking less about controlling you and instead thinking about how *legitimately* freaked out she gets seeing you hug your brother. \n\nIt is absolutely fine if families aren't super affectionate with each other. It's okay to be married to someone who had the opposite experience. But one upbringing should not affect the other partner so intensely.  \n\nDespite any other issues you and your wife may or may not have, her reaction is much deeper than being controlling or jealous.   \nShe shouldn't have asked you not to do it, but I believe she truly doesn't see why this request is wrong and that she should seek therapy.", "She says you are biased because of your upbringing. \n\nTHE EXACT SAME APPLIES TO HER!!.\n\nNo, NTA.

Numerous studies conducted over decades by behavioral psychologists show direct results of  children who have received physical affection from their parents having higher capacity for happiness, healthfulness, and intelligence.  \n\n>I understand the way I grew up was unusual, and maybe I am letting that cloud my judgement.\n\nIt's not unusual.  It's common.  The only thing that's unusual in this scenario is that she was raised by people who never provided any sort of normal emotional validation.  \n\nJust because she's uncomfortable with it doesn't make it wrong.

But her view on affection seems a little too skewed for just growing up in an anit-affection home.", "Same here DNTA hugging a sibling is so very normal! She most definitely needs to talk to a therapist!", "NTA, that's not how things work, and while she can set limits on how much she touches you, she has no right to demand that you stop showing other people healthy affection because of her problems.", "I don't think it's necessarily jealousy - there may be all kinds of family history behind it. Her attitude is very unhealthy though and she needs to get it sorted.\n\nHow does she cope in a public setting? Lots of hugging in airports, outside schools, practically everywhere you go. That is because it is *normal*.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Physical contact is such an important part of child development. For young children especially it is the primary way emotions like love, charring, acceptance, and security are understood and internalized.", "Right?! Does she not have any friends?", "My husband\u2019s sister always acted like I stole her man. I think this girl doesn\u2019t like \u201csharing\u201d her husband and is making excuses. Either way she is not a stable person.", "I think all those people who sexualize normal affection towards kids very strange. Like yes, of course, the father is kissing/hugging his daughter....that's normal.", "Yeah me toooo.\n\nAnd thanks. Unfortunately such a common story in families. :(", "Yes! Me too.", "Yeah, it hit my radar as well.", "Thanks! Definitely hard work to break cycles of abuse (my house was a DV house too) but so worth it. My kids are 5&8 now and doing amazing. Happy and secure people. Not horribly anxious or angry like myself and so many of my siblings. It's the best reward!", "Hell, my mom's side of the family, the older folks still kissed on the lips. Most little kids do too.", "You do know vasectomies can fail, right? Hope you get checked regularly.", "Thank you for agreeing with me. I\u2019m in no way trying to be hateful but something\u2019s  definitely off here", "Agree!", "Nope, still way more common than families that pass like icebergs in the night.", "My sister and I used to cuddle and hold hands as teenagers and even into our adulthood. Still hold hands with my mom and dad, and grandparents too, even into my 40s. I feel like this is all pretty standard stuff.", "I'm from Poland and I think that's pretty normal?", "I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019s convinced you that all this is abnormal not wholesome or too far, because it\u2019s just not. In fact, that\u2019s a pretty offensive and gross insinuation. She\u2019s got some very skewed thinking that she should explore with a professional.", "Kissing family members on the lips is one of those odd thing people get weird over. Every so often you see people on Instagram or whatever getting all up in arms because some celeb kissed their kid on the lips. It's bizarre. I don't do it, and obviously it's more normal in some cultures than others, but fucking hell, it's just affection.\n\nSomeone got weird at me for hugging my cousin at a wedding once. No kissing involved, just hugging & standing with our arms round each others shoulders. I actually felt kinda sorry for them. I'm really sorry for your loss.", "That\u2019s so sweet. My dad died when I was 21 but if he was still here I absolutely would still be kissing him.\nIt\u2019s why I make sure I always leave with a hug and a kiss with people I love, you never know when the last time is. I\u2019m also affectionate with my children and will continue to be for as long as they want.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when people sexualise it. I\u2019ve seen Reddit posts where people who don\u2019t understand or have had bad experiences sexualise it and I think it really says a lot about them. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some relationships out there in families that are completely inappropriate due to other behaviours that go along with the kisses and cuddles, but showing affection is not that", "You surprise me.", "If my future girlfriend told me she didn\u2019t want me hugging anyone, I\u2019d respect her wishes despite how difficult it\u2019d be for me.  It\u2019s a reasonable boundary and it\u2019s not by any means controlling.", "I agree with you that she has some things to work out.  But OP knew about these things and, instead of trying to make her life easier, blew past these boundaries.\n\nIf the roles were reversed I\u2019d judge in the same exact way.  Gender is a social construct and has no bearing on my opinion.", "I thought so too. Found the wife!!", "Nope, not at all.  Boundaries like this are healthy for a relationship and OP seems to not care at all.", "Seriously? I would have to go back literally multiple years to get to 12.", "She may need to get over it and see a counselor. Hugging family members is not the same as getting along with them. Keep hugging those you love.", "I also still hold my moms hand I\u2019m in my 20s.", "Why is that?", "Well good for you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re relationships with other people are so easy to set aside for new girlfriends\u2026 \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You have a lot to learn about relationships and boundaries then my friend. Good luck.", "It's not a reasonable boundary and it IS controlling AF.\nIf she forbade you hug your family because to her that's incest or she can only related it to a sexual relationship then she has a HUGE problem.\n\nOP NTA but is a red flag, RUN, get out of there before you have kids and she kick away a baby because hugging a baby/infant is like kissing/fvcking her own sister.", "So you\u2019re saying you\u2019d throw away your convictions to appease a partner? How hurtful it would be for someone you grew up with when you tell them, \u201cI\u2019m not showing you affection anymore because my bossy partner doesn\u2019t like it. \u201c. You\u2019re supposed to know who you ARE as a adult, not conform to others or you\u2019re going to be going around in circles in life trying to please everyone, which is impossible by the way. Stand by what YOU believe in, not what others THINK you should be doing and putting their insecurities off on you and your loved ones.", "Boundaries like this are not normal in any situation and maybe you and OPs partner should hit therapy together if you think this is at all reasonable.", "You can't scream \"boundaries! boundaries!\" and expect everyone to just cater to your demands because you said the magic word.", "I\u2019ve said this so many times before and I\u2019ll say it again.  We don\u2019t choose our blood relatives.  We choose our family.  OP has chosen his wife, and part of that choice is the responsibility of doing what he can to keep her happy.  She has the same responsibility with respect to him.  He\u2019s clearly ignoring this and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they eventually divorce.", "Your opinion is valid, and I respect that.  At the same time, though, he chose her and part of choosing her is no hugging.  The longer he can\u2019t grasp this, the worse things will be for him.", "The one boundary I would have in a relationship is that I\u2019m not willing to go NC with my brother and sister-in-law.  They are my rocks.  But if I loved my significant other enough I\u2019d go NC with everyone else.", "Your opinion is valid and I respect that.  At the same time, he chose her and with that comes the responsibility to look after her.  She has the same responsibility with respect to him.  OP has known for a while about her feelings about hugs and yet has done nothing to accommodate her.", "Honestly, I see this ending in divorce too. But from the other perspective. She clearly wouldn\u2019t allow affection to any children they have either. Or between them, which is frankly abusive. \n\nAnd yes, we choose our partners and I don\u2019t believe in the supremacy of blood relationships over all, but she clearly has no problem demanding something from her spouse that is actively harmful for them. I just couldn\u2019t imagine doing something like that to my husband.", "But she also chose him.", "Just no. This is such a bad way to view life.", "Or he could do himself a favour and end it. She should do herself a favour and get some therapy. You may also benefit from some yourself if you're willing to let someone push your boundaries to the point of not being able to hug your family.", "How come he has to change and not her when she also chose him", "That's not a healthy mindset.", "That\u2019s no way to live\u2026 you can\u2019t just breeze in and out of people\u2019s live messing with THIER emotions because of who you\u2019re with at the time\u2026. I can\u2019t believe you even think that way.", "Because that is not a reasonable accommodation to make. She\u2019s the one with the unrealistic and frankly absurd demand, it shouldn\u2019t be OPs responsibility to cater to that nonsense. You don\u2019t just do everything your partner says, because sometimes people can be unreasonable.", "Yes and he needs to make the conservative decision.", "All valid.  OP could also find another way to show proper affection to his blood relatives.  Might solve the problem.", "She can always choose divorce.  Plus it\u2019s far easier for OP to change.", "If you want someone badly enough I guarantee you\u2019ll make the same decision yourself.", "Would I ever act like the wife is acting?  No not at all.  But OP has to decide between his wife and his blood relatives.  He\u2019d be wise to choose the wife.", "OP shouldn\u2019t be forced to do anything illegal or unethical for a significant other.  I completely agree there.  At the same time, this is neither illegal nor is it unethical.", "Are you implying that his level of affection is somehow improper? Because that's what it sounds like you're saying.", "You're a pushover with no backbone or self esteem. I guarantee you no healthy partner will want to control you and isolate you.", "Alienating someone from the affection of their family feels pretty unethical to me.", "Yeah you\u2019ve gotta be some kind of troll. Goodbye.", "Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s improper.  But his wife thinks it is, and her opinion is the only one that should matter to OP.", "Where\u2019s the isolation?  The wife is not saying she wants OP to cut off all contact.  She wants an end to the hugging.  That\u2019s not unreasonable at all.", "Not family, but blood relatives.", "Nope, no troll here.  Just a concerned Redditor who wants the relationship to work.", "Yes family. You have your definition of family v. blood relatives I read. OP has chosen to consider his brother as family."]}
