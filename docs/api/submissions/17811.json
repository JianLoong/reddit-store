She is equating every physical touch between family members to essentially incest - I think most people would be extremely uncomfortable observing their loved ones *actually* being incestual with one another - so I believe her feelings are absolutely real. Growing up being taught that touching your family is extremely inappropriate **has** to be damaging to one's mental well-being.

It's okay to be married to someone who had the opposite experience.

I have to wonder if it isn't just about a lack of physical affection for her and possibly more about she had an incident as a child with a family member that made her associate familial affection with sexual attention.

And we reserve kissing to close family and romantic relationships.", "Big Hugs!", "\ud83d\ude25", "Yeah, when I was a teen I broke down one day and told my mom that I couldn't remember the last time she hugged me, and she was crying too just saying she wasn't a person who hugs. Things didn't change for a long time, but once I was in college, my mom started hugging me, and our relationship started to heal.\n\nI think something happened to her when she was young. Then, on top of it, she was always working to provide.\n\nWe've healed much of our relationship, and I think that conversation when I was teen really made animpression on her.\n\nI don't think she was purposefully abusive by not being physically affectionate. I think she just didn't know how for a very long time.", "Agreed and this is so much more than just not being a touchy person. She considers touching to be sexual. That\u2019s messed up.", "Reminds me of that one celebrity that got torn to shreds on the internet because she posted a photo of her giving her son a peck and hug.", "That's why Italians are so friendly with you. Ciao!", "This. I feel deeply sorry for op's girlfriend. I didn't have the best upbringing, but I can't even imagine being raised in a home without even a hint of physical affection. Sounds like she has been emotionally neglected her entire life.", "LoL okay that's a funny promise.", "I'm no therapist but, yes something isn't right. If she was mildly uncomfortable that is one thing but she sees it as so much worse leading me to believe she had a HUGGING UNCLE. but I don't know.", "I really don't get what your goal is here. If someone thinks that hugging your family is basically incest, there's probably something that caused that. Can't be sure what that is but like OP, my first thought was that she had been sexually abused by a family member.", "[removed]", "My daughter is 18 and still crawls into my lap for snuggles (she\u2019s petite so it works). We joke that one day she\u2019ll have her own baby snuggled in her arms while she herself is snuggled in mine. Generational snuggle", "Yeah, that\u2019s what we thought too. We were like \u201cWE ARE TRYING TO GIVE YOU MONEY, TAKE IT!\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "That\u2019s what OP is explicitly saying- she sees ALL physical affection as sexual or romantic.", "That's called catastrophizing, and is actually very unhealthy. It can be a symptom of anxiety and depression, or a number of other mental health issues. It is really unreasonable and is one of the many fun ways that the human brain tries to sabotage you.", "12x a day is just a crazy amount lol. If I\u2019m with family, I probably still only do 1-2 a day max unless it\u2019s an event or before travel or something.\n\nCaveat is I\u2019m not thinking of an SO, but even then\u2026 unless we\u2019re counting all forms of physical contact or cuddling as hugging?", "I would get reported to HR if I hugged \"my people\" any times a day as the people I see on a regular basis are at work.", "Some of us don't have people to hug lol", "If everyone did this, no one would ever not be hugging lol", "I did this, my ex also did this, and then as we were breaking up, we held a hug for 2 minutes until we realized what the other was doing.", "I agree that is an issue.", "I would never think my comment could come off as \"underestimating\". I specifically meant that any level of preference for physical affecfion is valid and does not make person \"broken\".", "And that's great. I am big on physical affection too.  But many people here act like it's unhealthy to dislike it.", "I meant that people wary and that is okay. I did not say \"she is an average Scandinavian\".\n\nEdit: I could have done better job communicating that to not allow misunderstanding.", "Thank you! I grew up into the exact opposite of OP's wife and I just love physical contact with the people who matter to me. I secured myself an equally cuddly boyfriend and I'm doimg very well!", "Agreed.\n\nHer family not hugging each other sounds uncommon. Her parents never showing any love or affection for each other sounds pathologic and makes me wonder about GF\u2019s childhood.", "That's a legit pandemic silver lining! There were so precious few of them.", "NTA. However, I believe that Op's wife needs counseling.", "I mean maybe that or her parents are super weird about affection towards her, her whole childhood?\n\nBut even then hasn't she ever seen her classmates and stuff be touchy growing up? Headlice doesn't come from nowhere!", "Came here to say that. There is a reason she can't differentiate between a brotherly hug and a hug that is, shall we shall,  not so innocent. I'm a \"this is my space\" kind of person, but even I know the difference.", "Same thought, she was probably sexually abused as a child so I have empathy for her but she needs therapy to process and deal with that.", "You've got issues too lol.", "Oooh! I much prefer generational snuggles to generational trauma.. good for you guys!", "OK love, you win. Have a nice day.", "Probably definitely some people who could use a hug at work though :< maybe keep them limited as a secret weapon for someone bad day so HR wont be so mad at you", "This is true. I also hug my dog at least ... oh god... 15 - 30 times a day? I think these hugs count too lol", "\"Ok, 3...2...1... RELEASE!\"\n\n\"Fuck yeah, Dan, we nailed it that time!\"", "Like that\u2019s a bad thing???", "I mean sure.\n\nBut OP is over \"dislike\" territory and more into \"weird aversion\" territory.\n\nI also know most people who aren't 'huggers' might still enjoy touch from their parents. I mean they changed your diapers, cleaned you etc. You should be used to their touch even if nobody else.", "No. They're saying it's unhealthy to 1) sexualize and 2) police other people's like of it", "You did bring up the cultural difference between Scandinavians and warm-climate countries, like there would be a huge difference on how people behave with affectionate behaviour in families, and there isn't that much difference in that particular aspect.", "My dad grew up in a house like that. I can count on one hand how often my grandfather hugged me. My grandparents frankly disliked each other, and there was no physical or even verbal affection. My grandad passed away in 2021, and I'm not sure he ever actually told my dad he loved him.\n\nWhen my mum was pregnant with me, my dad made a conscious decision he would not continue the cycle. He spent our entire childhood hugging, playing with and telling my brother and me how much he loves us. My brother and I are big huggers, tell our family and friends we love them often, and hug each other and our parents every time we see each other. \n\nOP, I don't know if you'll read this, but I would have had so many more issues without my dad making the decision to end his family's cycle of emotional neglect and lack of attention. If you are planning a future, especially children, with your partner, you two need to have a real conversation, probably in couples therapy, about how she's going to interact with your children.", "No kidding! She's freaking out over a hug. A freaking hug! \n\nI'm not a hugger. Other people are. She's trying to stop him from hugging *his brother*. She has some serious hangups. It is not the same as kissing a family member on the lips and honestly, a peck is not the same as a makeout either while we're on the subject.\n\nShe needs some therapy stat.", "Reported for offensive name", "Have you seen the meme where Spider-Man is stopping a bus before it hits kids in a cross walk? The bus is generational trauma, I\u2019m spider-man\u2026\n \nThe trauma may have been passed down through the generations but that doesn\u2019t make it an heirloom.\n\nI just knew I didn\u2019t want to pass this shit on to my kids. They have enough to deal with thanks to genetic lottery of adhd and broad autism phenotype, I wanted them to have someone in their corner fighting with them instead of against them.", "I mean I\u2019m not trying to win anything lol. But you have a nice day too!", "Maybe if you want to be abused by someone. While I don't think OP's wife is coming from a place of wanting to abuse and isolate him, saying that everyone should just do anything to appease a partner, including alienating other people who can be a support system (without cause - different if those people are causing issues in a marriage) - that's just opening up yourself to be abused and used. No one should accept everything carte blanche from their partner without thinking for themselves. \n\nAnyway, why should it be him (with the perfectly normal boundaries) rolling over to appease the spouse. Why shouldn't the wife \"do whatever it takes\" because she wants him so badly?", "Oh please. Now you\u2019re just contradicting yourself and talking in circles trying to justify yourself. Quit being a camp follower type and pick a conviction and stand by it instead of being so wishy washy", "Thank you for seeing the same humor I saw in it lol", "Not at all, hence the \"lol\"\n\nIf that was the rule, I'd absolutely never not be hugging someone, because I'm intensely touch starved after a breakup over a year ago. I just thought it was funny", "I am absolutely against the policing part, as I mentioned several times. The sexualize part is a very interesting topic for me, but I like hypothesising about things too much.\n\nIf you come from a place where hugs are considered sexual, is sexualizing them wrong?\n\nAnyway, I will wrap it here, it looks like people disagree with me and I will reflect on my thoughts without further arguing.", "The difference is there, and I did not mean to imply it has to be family-related. I wonder why this is taken as a criticism of Scandinavians.", "It is troubling that she confuses touching with romance and that kissing on the lips and hugs are the same thing. She had a highly dysfunctional childhood, and it may be due to factors other than her parents' lack of affection.", "lmao dude go to therapy", "Bro lmao", "I\u2019m on the side of OP respecting his wife\u2019s boundaries.  He chose her.", "It is funny, but it is also very effective, especially with children! I have one friend who practices the same thing and we actually usually do have to countdown to end a hug, but it\u2019s all in good fun and it never fails to make us laugh!", "It's not taken as criticism of Scandinavians, it's taken as you trying to point to cultural differences on something where most cultures are actually pretty similar. \nAre there a lot of cultural differences in other points? Absolutely, just not on this particular point.", "Not hugging his family members isn't unreasonable? If she herself doesn't want to be hugged by them it's fine and OP's family respected that. However she doesn't get to impose that on OP. Saying that he can't hug his family members and sexualizing it isn't reasonable at all. It's just insane and a sign that she needs therapy", "That is the same thing, in the context of the OP", "To OP, his blood relatives IS his family too, as is his wife."]}
