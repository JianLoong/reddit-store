She is equating every physical touch between family members to essentially incest - I think most people would be extremely uncomfortable observing their loved ones *actually* being incestual with one another - so I believe her feelings are absolutely real. Growing up being taught that touching your family is extremely inappropriate **has** to be damaging to one's mental well-being.

It's okay to be married to someone who had the opposite experience.

It's common.  The only thing that's unusual in this scenario is that she was raised by people who never provided any sort of normal emotional validation.  \n\nJust because she's uncomfortable with it doesn't make it wrong.

The babies would only leave the soft mother to eat and then quickly returned to the safety and affection of the soft mother.\n\nThis type of experiment is now considered to go against ethical standards due to the cruelty and negative impacts on the monkeys in terms of their ability to engage in normal social behavior with other monkeys as adults.\n\nLack of emotional and physical affection is definitely abusive.

It\u2019s absolutely mind-blowing to think and that mindset always made me feel icky.

He would beat her and lock her up. \n\n>Did he attempt to groom you for such a position?\n\nUhh, sort of? He tried to manipulate everything he could with me, including deleting my family's numbers off my cell. He would steal my packs of cigarettes and try to ration them. Eventually these kinds of behaviors became getting angry that I'd tried to hang out with the only friends I had left - a lesbian couple that were neighbors - and then beat me and dragged me by my hair into a closet where he locked me. I broke the door getting out and tried to escape, but he literally choked me against a wall then tried to throw me down a flight of stairs (both multiple times). Even though I had handprint bruises from him, cops (who said neighbors called trying to help me get away) believed his stories about me - saying that I was an alcoholic and mentally ill so he had to sometimes restrain me from trying to hurt myself. Eventually I found a time where he had taken my car (which he regularly took if he had to go somewhere) and one of the neighbor couple took me to file for an immediate restraining order. I got it, and the next day he tried to get me arrested, stole my savings, and even filed reports with adult protective services that I was in need of supervision (for the \"mental illness\" he swore I had). I'm thankful the victim's advocate detective gave me some resources that ended up helping me find a lawyer who helped me get the restraining order made permanent (he obviously lied in court, but did admit to locking me up against my will in a closet). It was probably one of the scariest times in my life. I eventually repaired my family relationships, but lost most of my support systems. He had poisoned most of my social circle against me - it was kinda crazy what people will believe when someone that good at manipulation says things (like that rationing my smokes was just because he wanted me to quit for my health, not because he was abusive - as a minor example). There's far more disturbing things that happened, but I don't like publicizing them. I have healed and found happiness and great relationship (which I've been in now for over 15 years), so those 9 months I was with him feel more like a bad dream these days. I feel awful if he ever found anyone else to manipulate as they probably did end up locked up by him.", "But if it's so ingrained in you as normal and acceptable, why would you think to bring it up in the first place?\n\nTherapy isn't a fact-finding mission; the patient comes in with items that they want to address, and the therapist guides them along that process.

It definitely sounds like one or all of the following:\n1) She was sexually abused, probably as a child, and has problems with touch because it was ALWAYS sexualized\n2) One parent was abusive and the other withdrawn, making both parents incapable of initiating any type of affection (some abusers get upset and jealous of their victim gives anyone - children included - any type of affection or attention bc they want undivided attention/devotion)\n3) both parents were abusive towards her (if parter violence was happening even the abused party might be abusive to her in an effort to \"regain\" some of their power) so any behavior designed to meet her need for affection was met with angry/unpredictable responses from her parents\n4) Parents were miserable and withdrawn.
