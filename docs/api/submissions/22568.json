I\u2019m precious with my belongings so this annoys me to no end on your behalf", "NTA, he's old enough to know better. And that step mom spoiling him will only ruin him. I'm sorry this happened, and I hope he buys you new comics.", "NTA! This is clearly a golden child taking advantage of his \"golden\" status, and pushing his boundaries knowing that there are seniors who are enabling his pushing. Your brother is absolutely and thoroughly TA because of his evil, wicked and VILE! - YES, VILE! - act of destroying something that you hold valuable. Your step-mum is also another thoroughly despicable TA. She has no respect for your property, and enables her son just because he's a son.\n\nAgain I reiterate, you are NTA, and maybe look into locking away your treasured belongings in a reinforced container that he can't break or open. This little vandal will go too far with his vandalising antics one day, get on the wrong side of the wrong people - and then he'll pay.", "NTA.  Actions have consequences, and it\u2019s destruction of your property.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are AHs.", "NTA!!", "NTA If they won't pay you back it would be a shame if someone dropped his electronics in the bath by mistake, just saying.", "ESH - You mentioned it already, you shouldn\u00b4t have yelled at him, and you shouldn\u00b4t have gone off on your step-mum like you did. I can\u00b4t really blame you because of your age, but as you grow older you will realise that your response was not the right one.   \n\n\nThat doesn\u00b4t mean what your step brother did was right and he was an asshole for doing that, and your step-mum should have backed you up there. So I entirely understand why you are so upset, and you have every reason to be upset. But as you mature you will need to learn to control your emotions because right now the situation has moved in a different direction.  \n\n\nThe original direction, of your stepbrother being the AH, and now you being the AH how you dealt with it.   \n\n\nI don\u00b4t think you are bad for it or an AH in general, given your age, but just like you expect and want consequences for your stepbrother, you need to face the fact that there are consequences to what you did as well.  \n\n\nSo my 2 cents; he should replace your comics and you should apologize to your step-mum. Ideally you\u00b4d have a talk with your stepbrother, but giving both your ages I think you can skip that one and it will need to be your parents to hash that out for you.  \n\n\nGood luck, you\u00b4re not an AH, but you acted a little bit like one", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
