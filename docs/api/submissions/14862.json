That could absolutely have serious consequences for you.   She's in denial about the reality of her choices.   When you sign up for a life wiht someone with mental health issues, YES you have to expect there to be problems, whether it's depression, anxiety or bipolar.  That doesn't mean they aren't people worthy of finding love, but don't pretend you're a victim of circumstances beyond your control.  \n\nNTA for anything but the delivery and the timing.

I don't live in the States but I would be concerned about anything that might affect my health insurance if I did live there.", "NTA\n\nOr, at worst, a justified AH.\n\nYou\u2019re going out of your way to help her in ways you don\u2019t need to do, she tries to cause you additional potential problems, and then gets mad when you refuse to go along with that.\n\nSome folks could screw up free ice cream and she seems to be that type.", "NTA for reminding her to be honest on the paperwork. But \u201cwhat did you expect\u201d was harsh and unnecessary.", "NTA. \n\nShe committed insurance fraud. So you had to call her out.\n\nBut also think about how you want to handle this going forward, because now she will have both a baby and an unemployed husband. So life is going to be hard for her for a while.\n\nAlso, don't be too harsh on her - he had a history of mental illness but also a history of actually staying on his meds. So it truly must have come out of left field for her to watch him go off meds and harm himself.

You were trying to be kind by providing her with income and health insurance while her husband cannot. She also has the option of applying for welfare and Medicaid.", "ESH, all the way. Your BIL for choosing not to take his medication; as someone with significant mental health issues myself, it can't be used as an excuse for poor behavior, and there is NEVER any reason not to take prescribed medication without the advice of your doctor. Doing that and affecting other people in your life, to the point of your pregnant wife losing health insurance, is major AH behavior. Your sister sucks for, first off, thinking she can \"be enough\" to keep a mentally ill person well, and secondly for trying to falsify insurance forms at your expense. You kindly helped her get a job and she took advantage of that by trying to lie, which could get you in trouble too. You suck for the way you spoke to your sister and the way you want to \"wash your hands of it;\" she's still your sister, she still needs help, and it's not your place to judge her for her choice of partner. It sounds like you're pretty dismissive of her and her needs in general given the rest of your family agrees that you were a jerk. You don't have to help her, but blaming her for her situation based on a decision she made years ago is not helpful and just made her feel worse.", "YTA, because everyone just LOVES hearing an \u201cI told you so\u201d during rough times.", "NTA", "NTA you tried.  Maybe you could have been more tactful, but I wouldn't have tolerated the lying.  \n\nUnfortunately she is pregnant, so if you can do anything then it would be good, but she needs to understand that you can't have her lying on paperwork.", "NTA you tried to be healthy. You however stopped her from defrauding the insurance company and the fact she is family the insurance company would have known you knew she lied, which in turn could have cost all of your employees their insurance.\n\nYou tried to help. I would offer no more help. I think since you see how she is going to take advantage of being related to you the job should be off the table.", "NTA - as someone who has experienced this (expecting new baby, completely freak out, stop taking my meds etc) this isn't something that your sister couldn't have prepared for. My partner new about my MH going in to our relationship and made the decision to live with the possibility of me neglecting to take my meds. They have prepared for that BUT also I have had to create firewalls to ensure this doesn't happen. This is something that needs to be discussed between them. He had a responsibility to take his medication and she has to realistically think about the outcomes of this not happening because taking your meds to remain somewhat healthy so you can look after your baby (and partner!) is a great incentive but that's not how things work!", "NTA stay out of it. If your sister messes up, fire her. Let her deal with the consequences of her action. Your sister and parents can help her.", "YTA, you were right about falsify the insurance application. It will cause a lot of legal issues down the road. But you didn't have to say 'what you expect',  your sister knew what she was getting into. She expects support from her family.

The company rates are based on what the insurance company expects to pay out for the policies.  Saying you're fine, when you have expensive medical issues, is fraud.", "You must still be honest though. Even under the ACA, or your coverage can be voided.", "Therefore you disclose such information.", "It can be fraud to the insurance company because the rate or care plan is based on the health information provided. Depends on the company. And I think it\u2019s wrong, mind you, to even ask people if they have pre-existing health conditions in order to qualify for a plan, but that\u2019s American healthcare for you. The companies can refuse to pay for costs related to a pre-existing condition. \n\nNonetheless, OP would be on the receiving end of it. However, OP\u2019s sisters pregnancy is also a pre existing condition. \n\nSo I\u2019m curious what the terms are that the mental illness has to be disclosed but not the pregnancy? Or what makes pregnancy less risky to the insurance provider than a mental illness does. Pregnancies are guaranteed to cost the insurance company money, mental illness is not.", "Yes but there are always loop holes and insurance loves the family. With her saying no it is fraud.

This is federal law.", "Why are you commenting when you clearly don't know anything about this topic? \n\nAll health insurance plans have to adhere to the provisions within the ACA, it is federal law. Essentially, all coverage is ACA coverage.\n\nThe act largely retained the existing structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market, but individual markets were radically overhauled.Insurers were made to accept all applicants without charging based on preexisting conditions or demographic status (except age). To combat the resultant adverse selection, the act mandated that individuals buy insurance (or pay a fine/tax) and that insurers cover a list of \"essential health benefits\".", "They can\u2019t deny a claim, but if they find out you lied on your application they can cancel the policy entirely. Fraud cancellation and claim denial are different under the law.", "Yes they can.

Given that context, what purpose could those questions possibly serve? Could it be that insurance companies ask these questions specifically for the purpose of cancelling policies since federal law prohibits them from denying coverage?", "No, you're not on \"ACA health insurance.\" You either have employer provided life insurance, an individually purchased policy, or Medicaid.", "They can\u2019t deny a claim for a preexisting condition, but those conditions are still part of calculating the policy premium.\n\nMy point is that you\u2019re confusing claim denial with policy cancellation for fraud and giving an incorrect answer. Those are two different things. An insurance company is legally permitted to require disclosure of preexisting conditions on the application in order to calculate the policy. Once the policy is issued, THEN it becomes illegal for them to deny a claim under it.", "Or medicare", "But i thought you said all coverage is aca coverage?", "I am not confusing anything with anything else. You are wrong wrong wrong. Nothing about my answer was incorrect. \n\nYou know damn well that you don't know anything about this topic. Stop talking out of your a$$. Google it, ffs.\n\nInsurance companies cannot charge higher premiums based on preexisting conditions. This was one of the most important parts of the legislation. \n\nPreexisting conditions are irrelevant to both premiums and claims. That's what I am saying. Show me where I am wrong?\n\nWhat are you not understanding? \n\n\"But, but, but... they can cancel policies for non-disclosure.\" Do you understand how duplicitous it is to ask an irrelevant question solely for the purpose of cancelling policies? The feds tell insurance companies you can't charge more and you can't say no. The insurance company wants to reject people who are going to cost them more money, they can't. So, they ask questions like these on their applications hoping that they catch certain people in inaccurate answers. This is a work around. They are trying to circumvent the law. This is a loophole that they've created."]}
