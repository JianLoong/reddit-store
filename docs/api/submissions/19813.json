When I was i\u00a0 high school I bought some cheap rings that looked cool, one of them had a tiger on it. My mom said the ring was 'demonic' and making me look like a gangster so I shouldn't wear rings like that. I just didn't understand why I couldn't buy something as simple as a ring and I crit's. Once I got the rings she didn't say much about them and thought they were fine. \n\nMy mom asks me if I would date a bi woman and I say yes ofc and we have like a 1 hour conversation abt it and after it they tell me it's the worst night they've had in their entire lives and that they couldn't sleep after that. The next year I bought a pearl necklace cause I thought it looked cool and my mom just started yelling at me, she said to\u00a0 throw it out that I look gay and that my dad would pass away if he saw me in that. I was angry it didn't make sense to me but I threw away the necklace.

She told me this and I remember it so clearly  \"I hope one day you are under the knee of a police officer so you know what I mean.\" I was shocked and I didn't say anything.

She says she looked through my books and thought the book was demonic and that I should watch what I put in my head. I just wasn't having it that day, I tried explaining to her but she wouldn't listen. His has happened more times but these are the ones I can remember. I don't have these problems with others, I am a pretty quiet guy and I try to be nice to those around me.

My mom was traveling to the motherland at the time but took the time to send me an ALL CAPS message that said:\n\n(My name) IN THE NAME OF OUR HOLY GOD JESUS CHRIST, PLEASE TAKE IT OFF! YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR!! I AM SHOCKED!!\n\nFor almost a year, we had several conversations where she tried to gaslight me into taking it off.\n\nHere are few examples:\n1. If you love me, you will take it off. Do you love me? Are you telling me you don\u2019t love me?\n\n2. Only children do that! Are you a child? Who will hire you with that on your face? (I got a job in the government in the same year. Lol!)\n\n3. As a Christian, the Bible says that we should not conform to this world! (I replied that very same Bible states several times that when, with God\u2019s blessing, a woman was claimed by her husband, as a gift, he would literally give her a nose ring!)\n\nListen, I get it. For years, I was mad and frustrated with my mom. But here is what I\u2019ve learned: that\u2019s her love language. It\u2019s not a particularly healthy one but it is her love language.\n\nMy mom went to a boarding school in Africa that was led by the Catholic Church. Just like a lot of black communities, they were led to believe that the only way to look clean was to have straight hair. That men having long hair made them gangsters or hoodlums looking for trouble. That wearing an ankle bracelet was for prostitutes. That dreadlocks meant you were a drug addict.\nI could go on, and on, and on and ON! \n\nShe was raised and conditioned by a system that dictated what was \"right\" or \"wrong\" and punished when she would do anything that wasn\u2019t \"right\". When I say punished, I mean physical abuse by the \"teachers\" at this school!\n\nThat\u2019s not just my mom, generations upon generations of African children were told these lies by white people who invaded their countries, brought war and separated them from their family under the guise of \"education\". Now, all these children grew up and are emotionally scarred. \n\nYour mom is trying to protect you to the best of her abilities! \n\nListen, I now have blonde dreadlocks, tattoos and piercings. I\u2019ve shaved my hair. Dyed it hot pink, purple, blue\u2026 I\u2019m also an artist. Went to school for it. She still doesn\u2019t always understand my art. When I was working on an abstract self-portrait she asked \"why isn\u2019t this one \"pretty\"? You don\u2019t look lie that! Why are you doing that to your face?\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  \nShe\u2019ll look at my art books and will see some depictions that are admittedly a bit darker and will say Satani! (Meaning Satan. Pronounced Shay-tah-new in my mother tongue) honestly, that\u2019s a very African thing. Even non-Christians say it when they find something weird.\n\nI have given her the emotional ride of a lifetime! (I\u2019m also a pastor\u2019s daughter. Sooo, I get this more than you could ever know!)\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie to you, I\u2019ve had to go through therapy to understand myself and her better. To let go of this anger I previously had with her comments.\nIt has helped tremendously! \n\nI had a conversation with her in which I asked her if she thought she raised me well. She said yes. I then asked her if she thinks that all of these things she doesn\u2019t like made me a bad person. She said no but she just doesn\u2019t like it and if I keep it, knowing it breaks her heart, that it\u2019s not right! \n\nI told her she is choosing to let it \"break her heart\" when all of it has nothing to do with her. I did it because I like it! She might not like it, and that\u2019s okay, but we must agree to disagree. These are my decisions and she must learn to respect them. I also told her that it pains to hear her say that her love for me is now conditional to me doing what she wants. She said it isn\u2019t and that she only wants the best for me.\n\nWe\u2019ve now moved on from it. She still makes comments sometimes and I always reply with: Yet, I really like it! But let\u2019s agree to disagree because I love you!\n\nChoose your battles and learn to not let it get to you. Have conversations with her to understand where she is coming from. For me, when I did, it became a game changer. \n\nMove out! Find your voice! Find your truth but grant her some grace!\n\nI love my mother so much. I would go to war for her and I know she would for me too!\n\nGood luck!!\n\nEdited to add this next part:\n\nPS, this part was actually painful to read:\n\n> I'm black, my mom is an immigrant. She speaks English well and you couldn't really tell her apart from other black people but her background of being a religious immigrant.\n\nI live in a country where English and French are the national languages but people mostly speak English which she 100% understands but doesn\u2019t really speak properly but she speaks\u2026 3 other languages. Fluently. Both my parents are polyglots.\n\nAnd what does telling her apart from other black people mean? Baby, black is black is black!\nEmbrace the culture, know your roots and be proud of them! Whether she wears traditional outfits or jeans, it shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nI feel like there might be some lack of understanding because you don\u2019t understand your roots. It would be a good idea to work on that!\n\nI\u2019m rooting for you!", "NTA. Your mother is mentally unwell.
