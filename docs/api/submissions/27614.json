One night, I went through his phone to find a picture he had taken of us earlier in the night and found old & new screenshots of our texts. After a short look later, I found he was sending them to his mom.\n\nHe was sending her screenshots of our private conversations (not sexual- just me ranting/venting to him about our issues) and i found references to them talking about our intimate life with her in the past. I felt a bad way about it- but I stayed quiet.\n\nDuring a recent argument with my bf, about some of the same lies and issues, he angrily lets it slip that his mother thought he could EASILY find someone better. \n\nAnd he let me know he agreed. \n\nHe said agreed he could find better, but that he \u201cloved\u201d me and wanted to stay regardless of that knowledge.\n\n\nHow is someone supposed to react to that? \n\n\nI cried for countless nights, wondering if anything I had done for this relationship was actually worth it if he really believed he could just leave because there are better women out there. I felt awful and exposed and since I did not feel comfortable admitting this to my own family; I\u2019ve felt more alone than ever. We eventually made up, but its been sitting on my heart ever since.\n\nIts been almost two weeks since that argument. I still feel pretty hurt, as I thought my relationship with him and his mom was pretty good. Or at least I thought that his mom thought I was okay. But she now knows things about me that I didn\u2019t need her to know. I felt increasingly uncomfortable and finally confronted my bf about this and told him I didn\u2019t appreciate him sharing our private information with her. We argued for a bit but eventually he told me he understood and that he wouldn\u2019t do it anymore. And we left it like that.\n\nWith everything that had happened and with normal work and life- I had forgotten that we had preplanned a time to visit together with his mother tonight to have drinks and watch the game. \n\nI made the decision to not go. \n\nMy bf was upset by this, but has still decided to still go without me. I don\u2019t want to go and be two faced to them and act like nothing is wrong. But I also don\u2019t want him to go cause I feel like that would give them the opportunity to talk off the record.

He shares private conversations with his mommy and treats you like shit.  YOU can do so much better than him", "i think its bizaare u stay i mean have some self respect for yourself and move on.", "Nta. Dump him. You can do better.", "Listen, you can do better. I think you learned a lot from this relationship and it's time you found someone that deserves your love.", "ESH.  You going through his phone, you for not leaving long ago, and you for thinking he is worth crying over.  I don\u2019t think I have to explain why they are.", "Honestly, do yourself a favor and let him go \"find someone better,\" because for sure, you DESERVE better!\n\nWhat a pair!\n\nNTA\n\nBe kind to yourself and your sense of self-respect. I am going to tell you this now, barring some extreme circumstance, people don't change, and people in relationships don't improve their behavior. It will only get worse. Save years of therapy and leave now when you only need a little bit of therapy ;)", "My girl, you're asking the wrong question. Don't ask about going to see the mother. Your bf has been nonstop betraying you by revealing your private conversations to his mother, blatantly putting  her ahead of you. Telling you he agrees he can do better than you but is staying \"because he loves you\" is a tactic to diminish your self esteem and make you think oh, how lucky am I that he's choosing me. And overlook all the other bad behavior.\n\nThat's not what love looks like.\n\nYou are NTA, but you ***are*** overdue to get that mess the heck out of your life. You can do so much better. You **are** so much better. You coukd dump him and get a cactus plant and already be doing 100x better.", "Look, he's shown you who he is. You should take him up on it and tell him \"I can do better too so I'm going to go find it.\" and leave him. Find someone who actually likes and loves you.", "NTA. Dump that mama\u2019s boy. He has no business talking about your relationship especially intimate stuff with his mother.", "I can be a mama's boy myself, but sending conversations to her is way out of line. That alone would make you NTA to give up.\n\nUnless you want her knowing everything, run. He's breaking so many boundaries it is insane.", "How is someone supposed to react to that?\n\nBy wishing him good luck and walking out. This isn't a solid relationship. He's just stringing you along until he finds someone better. If you're ok wasting your best years on momma's boy, go ahead and stay. But if you think you deserve better, dump his basic ass and go out there to find a real man.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nbut you should dump him. This is not something that you can come back from. He disrespectEd you and abused your privacy, you will never trust him fully again. Don\u2019t waste any more time on him, you can certainly do better.", "NTA. He\u2019s a momma\u2019s boy. There is nothing sexy about that. Get out now. Don\u2019t waste anymore of your time.", "You should be packing up and getting out of there. That's how you should have been spending the last 2 weeks. Tell him his mommy is right; you're not the girl for her little boy. That whole crying to his mom is never going to stop. Even after she dies, he'll do it. In fact, what do you think he did after the last argument? And yes, you're the topic of conversation. Has he dropped the name of the girl his mom has picked to replace you?", "Oh man, let the trash take itself out! Let him go and find better!", "He\u2019ll be doing this for the next five years. I\u2019d scrape my shoe and walk on.", "NTA. But you\u2019re still with him because\u2026?", "Honestly if I were in your shoes this relationship would already be over at this point even if I didn't want to admit it to myself. \n\nThere's no recovering from broken trust.", "NTA. Go find better than him. Just a momma's boy that will hang off her every word. You will always be 2nd to her.", "NTA, you cannot stop him from meeting his mom, if he had to choose, he would choose her. He might be a great son, but not a right partner for you because he believes he can do better and someday he might find someone better and leave you. Not a reliable partner, think about your relationship carefully", "Exactly, Op he will do this for the rest of your relationship, no matter what you do he\u2019ll be texting his mom about you. And now that he poisoned his Mom against you, you can never do anything to undo that damages, that has most likely reach the rest of his family.", "Exactly. This is so fucked up that he shares such screenshots and intimate details with his mother. I'm mortified. And then basically says that he can find someone better, expecting OP to learn what her place is in this relationship and stop complaining. Just vile.", "And when you break up with him, reference how YOU deserve and will find better.", "Yeah. Talking to a third person about close details of a relationship is a bad... ujnless the thuurd person is a trained professional therapist. \n\nThere s always someone better on some scale...WTF.", "Yeah, OP needs to know that is he need \u201cmommy dearest\u201d opinion on a better girl, the one that can find better is her, better to waste 3 years, that getting married or something and having to endure this for all her life (not really they can separate at any point but why the hassle)\n\nShe can definitely do better, he set the bar pretty low, also I hope she understands that this kind of emotional blackmail shouldn\u2019t sit well with her and that she has options, she\u2019s 24 for F sake, she has all her life ahead of her, if she dumps him she should call the mommy and tell her \u201cnow find him someone better, I F\u2019ing dear you!\u201d", "I misread this at first but then I saw \"to yourself\" and now I 100% agree. OP, you deserve better than someone who doesn't see you as the best.", "I think we all are.", "Look up sunk cost fallacy. HE needs to do the work and go to therapy himself to see why he is so enraged with his mom but it will take years and has to want to. It will take him a long time to even want to. What would you tell your best friend or even a stranger to do?", "Talk to your family, get help. They\u2019ll support you in leaving this toxic relationship. It\u2019s always hard to leave a relationship that you\u2019ve put so much of your time, effort and love into but seriously , protect your own mental health. It will feel like shit but eventually, you\u2019ll feel better and once you\u2019ve healed, you\u2019ll understand and appreciate why all of us are telling you to run away from this dude.", "I am sorry you are going through this with someone so undeserving. You deserve better than a man in a relationship with his mom.\n\nCry, grief the relationship and move on", "Write a letter of how he makes you feel, what he has done in the past, and is doing now, and use these to strengthen your resolve. I was in a relationship with a man i used to live with the whole of my heart (bless \ud83e\udd23) and i just one day realised he doesnt even respect me to support me when I'm balling my eyes out and something he had said or done. He promised many times to be better and he never meant it. I realised i would be happier alone than walking on eggshells making him happy. And you know what, i was right, i know how to make myself happier than he ever could. My new boyf has also shown me time and time again that i can expect respect and care in a relationship. Theres a happier life out there waiting for you to grasp it. You can do it!", ">And now that he poisoned his Mom against you, you can never do anything to undo that damages, that has most likely reach the rest of his family.\n\nTHIS! There is no coming back from this. No matter how wonderful OP is to the mom and the rest of the family, they are only EVER going to see her the way she has been painted. \n\nOP, there is nothing left for you in this relationship. Your bf actually thinks he is doing you a favor by not dumping you. You deserve better.", "What a horrible guy (momma's boy).\n\nOP you will never be able to trust this man again after what he did with those texts. Unforgiveable.\n\nNTA"]}
