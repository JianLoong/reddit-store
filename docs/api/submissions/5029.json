It really works wonderfully for us and makes us happier as a couple.\n\n \n\nOn Friday, I was out on Christmas dinner with my coworkers.

You can't control what you do when you sleep, so if there's issues with sprawl, mattress/bedding preferences, temperature, movement, snoring, etc. having separate sleeping areas at the very least as an *option* is a very common, healthy way of making sure everyone gets the quality of sleep they NEED.\n\nAdditionally, it means that any intimacy or cuddling that happens is an *active choice,* not compulsory or incidental.\n\nSuzie sounds extremely insecure and has a narrow, judgmental view on co-habitation in relationships.", "NTA.

Just because we don't like how someone handled their feelings doesn't mean we instantly know the reason behind those feelings.", "I dunno, you should reconsider. I gave up sleeping with your wife a while ago and it's been great!", "> Suzie should work at the movie theater because she\u2019s great at projecting.\n\nInstant updoot for that line", "Eh...that's not quite accurate. Television and movies used to show two separate beds because censorship wouldn't permit them to show adults sharing one bed, but the average family had neither the space nor the furniture for couples to sleep separately. Far more common was for the entire family to share a single bed.", "My parents have separate places to live. They call each other three or more times a day and then spend weekends and holidays in the same place, and they\u2019re both very happy together and their marriage has never been better. Some people just really need space and alone time to be happy, and there\u2019s no reason why a healthy couple can\u2019t have that if they both like space.", "I know, right?!  Wonder if she\u2019s even bothered to see a doctor about the snoring either?", "You should never call a truth bearer a liar anyway. Its absurd?", "Have you read the post??", "Hmmmm\u2026maybe has to do with location then? My great grandparents had two twin beds in the same room just a few feet apart until Grampy passed away in 1988. My grandparents on both sides also slept separately but in the same room into the late 60s. They were not particularly religious, or prudish, and were liberal politically\u2026 so now I\u2019m left with questions lol!!", "I completely understand the desire for intimacy and the comfort of a sleep partner.  However, Suzie is prioritizing her wants and refusing to have the same level of empathy for her partner\u2019s very real sleep deprivation.  Now, rather than accepting she needs to take action, she is lashing out at OP.\n\nSimply put - if Suzie wants to keep the co-sleeping arrangement, then Suzie needs to get herself to a sleep clinic and leave OP alone.", "Ok but why is this OPs fault?", "Maybe for some it\u2019s hurtful \nbut not for the OP who simply mentioned it works in HER OWN marriage , it is ridiculously immature and dishonest for Suzie to blame OP for Suzies insecurity in her own marriage .", "Do the husband's feelings about wanting to sleep soundly not matter?", "Feelings are less important than your partner health", "That\u2019s still perceived intimacy. She perceives sleeping in the same bed as intimacy because it works for her. She gets sleep and she gets to know her partner is there by her side. He doesn\u2019t get to sleep and he sits there resenting her. \n\nIt\u2019s still an image of the perfect marriage. For some people sleeping close to others feels intimate. For others it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nMy boyfriend loves to spoon. Then he falls asleep first and I have less than one foot of bed width with 200 pounds leaning dead weight against my back. That\u2019s not intimate for me. We had to have a conversation and figure out how to adjust so I wasn\u2019t angry at him every night.\nOn weekends he stays up playing video games until 5 am and doesn\u2019t want to wake me when he comes in, so he sleeps on a futon in our office. I go to wake him up weekend mornings and he looks up at me all cute and sleepy\u2026 that\u2019s intimacy to me. Caring about your partner getting good sleep is more emotionally satisfying than that sleep happening with five feet of you. Honestly, for her co-worker to be this upset and blaming her or being upset with her husband feels like gaslighting. She\u2019s the one making things hard but just wants to blame everyone else and brand them as liars and AHs so she doesn\u2019t have to make concessions. \u201cYou\u2019re all jerks taking something away from me!\u201d Is an easier stance to take than admitting you\u2019re a problem.\n\nNTA, OP. You didn\u2019t do anything but tell the truth.", "I have insomnia. I can't imagine asking anyone else to lay there all night while I read or watch TV with the mute imposed and closed captioning. And just turning off my head and going to sleep has not worked in 25 years. I think I've had sleep troubles since I left my parents home when I was 17, really? So, anyone who equates remaining in cuddle zone with me every night with their feelings might have to really look at that idea? Because I am a nightmare to sleep with. You don't want to be in love with someone like me if your feelings are complicated like that. It really ain't personal - even though people do get their feelings in a twist sometimes over the idea.", "There are solutions for snoring. Maybe Suzie should pour her apparent excess energy into exploring those.", "She can verbalize it just like that. She's a grown adult.", "There are supports for that. Sometimes surgery, definitely a cpap can help. \n\nDon\u2019t give up because everyone just shrugged. \n\nReally. Snoring isn\u2019t normal.", "Do yourself a favor and take your own advice.", "Yeah, I tried that a little while and it sucks to be the person that never had a problem sleeping and not can't or wakes up and has to leave in the middle of the night due to snoring. And then being made to feel guilty about it \n\nMy current partner and I just started sleeping separately a few weeks ago. He was adamantly against it and now he loves it. I need quiet and cool and lots of covers and a firm mattress. He needs tv on, quicksand mattress that was destroying my back and he snores. We nicknamed his bed the corvette and mine the suv due to how different they were structured. I gmhad to pull myself up and out of his bed and I hated it.\n\nJust sleep separately if you have the luxury.", "Don't forget that all that snoring will cause hearing loss to the other spouse.", "It was the kind of thing we used to talk about a lot. But, nothing has changed for me physically in all the many years I have been married. And so, I did start getting out of bed after my husband falls asleep and just going into the next bedroom, rather than disturb him. Laying beside him in the dark with my eyes open only increases my frustrations.", "Mine's certainly do to me. (But, he is the one who'd prefer I just stayed in bed with him. He knows that logically this isn't about how close we are to each other at all. He just wishes we shared a bed all night every night and I can only do that for so many nights before I need to just be in a bed and \"sleep.\" I don't think this has a happy compromise? Just be considerate of your partner and let them do what they need to do to sleep?", "Hopefully something positive still can. I feel bad for whatever Susie is going through, hope she can learn to express it in a way that gives her some help.", "Have you never lashed out at anyone? The tone of your comment speaks otherwise.\n\nShe made a mistake, I\u2019m saying Susie might need a little empathy.", "Lashing out at someone actually indicates a lack of energy.\n\nEver heard the phrase \u201cshe was at the end of her rope\u201d? That\u2019s what that means.", "\u2026. If she doesn\u2019t know how to verbalize it than no. She can\u2019t.", "This is a thing??? Omg I love this idea!!!! This is sheer genius!", "Oh man, I didn\u2019t even know that part.  And hearing loss is already an issue in my family. Excuse me, I need to go make some phone calls. \ud83d\ude0b", "It happens? that explains a lot...", "Falling sleep next to someone prevents cheating? I'm gonna need a source on that. And if you're crying yourself to sleep because your partner didn't sacrifice their sleep every night to appease your ego, the relationship probably has deeper cracks. Consistent disrupted sleep is TERRIBLE for you, not to mention dangerous for drivers.", "You know what's also a relationship and intimacy killer? Resenting your partner bc you get max 5 hours of sleep every night that is regularly interrupted by their snoring, and add to that they won't see a doctor to address it. The lack of sleep is detrimental to mental health and if you really think your partner should accept that, then you're being petty self-centered. I've been on both sides of this and trust me, the lack of sleep and feeling like your partner doesn't care was far more detrimental than not sharing a bed.", "There's a massive difference between \"Hey, honey, I'm not getting quality sleep because of XYZ and it's starting to affect my health.  I would like to sleep in a different room so I can get the rest I need to function.\" and \"I hate you and just don't want to be with you anymore\".", "Neither myself nor my husband cry ourselves to sleep at night. \n\nHe has sleep apnea and use a machine with a face mask and long hose. I can hear the wind rushing through the pipe. When he moves, the mask slips and there goes the sawing of the logs. \n\nWe talked about it, I like my sleep, he needs 10 hours on his machine. We now sleep in separate bedrooms and life is wonderful. We still have intimacy, we still cuddle in his bed until he falls asleep, then I go my own room.  \n\n10 years and counting for separate rooms and still going strong with a 20 year marriage behind us.", "obviously, i\u2019m human but i\u2019m not going to lash out at someone answering questions my husband ask. OP wasn\u2019t bragging just answering questions that they were asked. if she\u2019s gonna lash out at anyone it should be her husband.", "You're excusing toxic behavior. Ofcourse she has problems. And ofcourse she shouldn't be taking them out on random co-workers.", "Huh? A grown person should be capable of saying \"I don't like that idea.\" If she can't even communicate that much, how is she ready for a serious relationship?", "My husband and I considered it, but we decided to try a king-size bed.  Big enough that we don't touch (unless we want to), we never shared blankets to begin with, he's doing better about using his CPAP machine, and we got a white noise machine.  Those things made it possible for us to sleep together.  If that didn't work, we have a queen bed in another room and a twin daybed in the living room.", "Yeah, if Susie feels unstable in her marriage she will probably lash out at the wrong person\u2026 obviously.", "I\u2019m not excusing anyone. I didn\u2019t say Susie was right for lashing out, she\u2019s not. All I said was I feel bad for her, and I indicated a couple reasons why. You can\u2019t empathize with her? Yikes. Now I feel bad for you and the people in your life.", "Clearly you\u2019re ignoring underlying issues. I don\u2019t think Susie would have lashed out if there weren\u2019t any. \n\nDo you have anything you\u2019re sensitive about that if someone confronted you about you wouldn\u2019t know how to react?\n\nSometimes things happen to us or we go through things we don\u2019t understand. We can\u2019t verbalize what we don\u2019t understand.\n\nRelationships are not nearly as simple as you seem to think :P", "We have a king-sized bed also.  Our biggest issues are that he's a very light sleeper - if the dogs make the tiniest noise he jumps up to take them out even though they don't really need to go.  Or his work phone will ping because he's on 24/7 for his job.  And when he does fall into a deep sleep, he starts snoring.  So most nights I get very little actual rest.  He doesn't like it when we sleep separately but the alternative is me leaving entirely because I deserve my rest too.  So as soon as our guest room is cleared of the packing still stored there, I'm going back to having my own room again.  I'm tired of being so exhausted I can't function most days.", "But Suzy did.", "I can empthatise for as long as they don't try to blame others for their problems. That is an inexcusable lack of character in my book.", "I've been in many relationships, as well as a very successful one with my current partner of three years (cohabitating for 2). I have a pretty good handle on how they work. \n\nNo one is suggesting that they can't be sensitive or taken aback by personal questions. That's not relevant to the OP or our discussion. What I'm saying is that if you're not emotionally capable of talking about core aspects of your relationship with your long-term partner, that relationship absolutely has deeper issues than who sleeps where. Which it sounds like you agree with! But none of that makes the husband's position unreasonable-- dude just wants to sleep at night and spend time with his partner during the day.", "Then it\u2019s your limited empathy that\u2019s the problem here. Have you tried therapy?", "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re making irrelevant comments then \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Endless empathy has another description: Being a pushover. A limit to empathy isn't a wrong state of being but a normal one.", "Because your comment made Susie out as the victim of a situation where she's the AH. If we don't know their underlying issues, we can't assume Susie isn't the problem in other regards, too. I understand it's a tough position, but that doesn't give her the right to lash out at OP and stop communicating with husband. It's bad behavior. If she feels sleeping together is an incompatibility, she can take whatever steps she feels are right; what she can't do is throw a tantrum."]}
