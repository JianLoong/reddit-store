We\u2019ve been together for 14 years at this point. We moved in together quickly, only after going out for a few months and after the honey moon period was over, we realised that we\u2019re not compatible sleepers. We were happy as a couple but our sleeping habits and preferences really didn\u2019t match. He likes scratchy blankets when I like soft fabrics, he snores loudly and it wakes me up, he moves a lot, he makes my bed too hot, my duvet was too thick for him and so on and so forth. We tried compromises such as separate duvets, etc. And they did work a bit but were not ideal. So eventually, the next house we rented had two bedrooms and it worked like a charm. We could pick whatever bedding we wanted, we weren\u2019t disturbed in our sleep and overall had better sleep quality.\n\n \n\nSure, if one of us felt the need for cuddles, we still would occasionally sleep in the same bed but majority of nights we slept separately and we were better than ever. When we bought our house, we made sure each of us could have our own bedroom and we did what we wanted with them. It really works wonderfully for us and makes us happier as a couple.\n\n \n\nOn Friday, I was out on Christmas dinner with my coworkers. It wasn\u2019t anything fancy and after that we went out to a pub for a few drinks and some of my coworkers invited their partners as well.\n\nMy coworker/work friend Suzie, her husband, a few other coworkers and I were sitting at the table drinking and chatting and somehow the conversation went to snoring spouses. No idea who or why started it but we were all slightly tipsy. Someone asked me if my husband snores as well and I said yeah which is why we have separate bedrooms. Didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\n \n\nSuzie\u2019s husband seemed interested in the idea and asked me a few questions which I honestly replied to. Basically, things I mentioned above.\n\n \n\nToday, Suzie called me, really angry, saying I was an asshole for even mentioning that I have a separate bedroom. Saying things like \u2018who does that\u2019 and \u2018you must be really unhappy\u2019 and \u2018stop pretending it makes you happy, you\u2019re just faking it\u2019 and so on. She was furious, pretty much crying and shouting at me.\n\nI was quite surprised and tried to understand what the hell happened. I guess I should\u2019ve just disconnected but this was so unlike her.\n\nWell, it turns out Suzie snores a lot and her husband love the idea of having separate bedrooms and wanted to try it. Suzie sees it as ultimate end to their relationship, as disrespectful, as not something married couples should do.\n\nSo now, she blames me for introducing her husband to the idea and validating it with my lies (I haven\u2019t lied).\n\nI didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong at the time but I do feel bad for her and wonder, am I really an asshole here?", "created_utc": 1671372290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zozd5m/aita_for_having_separate_bedrooms_with_my_husband/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
