You can't control what you do when you sleep, so if there's issues with sprawl, mattress/bedding preferences, temperature, movement, snoring, etc. having separate sleeping areas at the very least as an *option* is a very common, healthy way of making sure everyone gets the quality of sleep they NEED.\n\nAdditionally, it means that any intimacy or cuddling that happens is an *active choice,* not compulsory or incidental.\n\nSuzie sounds extremely insecure and has a narrow, judgmental view on co-habitation in relationships.", "NTA.

Bc houses are *big* decisions for couples. There are so many little things they have to agree on or compromise on. Too much disagreement and refusal to compromise leads to tension in the relationship. What if hubby wants a man cave but doesn't care if his wife gets her own room as well, and she doesn't like that? What if one house is too far from town and one partner likes the distance but the other one hates it? I dunno about you, but those things sound like direct interferences with marriage. \n\nAs for pets, are you not aware that that's a pretty commom dealbreaker? Some ppl have current pets, get married, their pet dies and they want another, but their partner was only okay with the current pet bc it was already old and don't want another.

I have sleep apnea and now use a CPAP machine when I sleep. It's definitely not a sexy look, but it's been legit life changing for the quality of sleep that I get - I didn't realize how exhausted I was before until I started using my CPAP. I was already using it before I met my husband, but I've fallen asleep without it a few times since, and he's told me that the snoring/literal lack of breathing on my end is stressful to hear.

Eventually I broke down sobbing about it and he volunteered to sleep in the spare room. That's where he sleeps now, and everything is so much better.
