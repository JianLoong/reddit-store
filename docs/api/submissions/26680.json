You will have bird droppings, water and seeds in a five foot radius around the bird. Yes, they are incredibly social creatures and he should not have got one if it was going to be left alone for much of the time.   NTA", "NTA.  Parrots are a LOT of work as you mentioned. They are noisy as all get out when they're bored or feel ignored. She should have thought about that before she got a pet that lived 30-50 years.  She needs to join a group that raises parrots so she can deal with this herself.", "NTA, your neighbor is asking if you can dedicate time during your workday to care for a pet that he doesn't care to take care of and can't be bothered to find a pet appropriate day-care.\n\n\"Some neighbors are now saying I\u2019m being unreasonable.\" ...and those same neighbors, if they actually cared, and weren't just poking at you, would perform the service gladly...  obviously they are not.", "NTA. His bird, his responsibility. He must have aware that he works away during the day when he bought the bird. He also needs to remember that you are a polite and friendly neighbor and not a subservient spouse. Good on you for maintaining solid boundaries. Your other neighbors can volunteer to babysit the bird for him if they feel so bad.", "NTA.  Parrots are intelligent social birds that need stimulation and companionship.  Parrots in captivity typically bond with one person.  That person will be you. \n\nYour neighbor has made a bad decision. He either didn't do his research or ignored it. A parrot left alone  most of the time will usually fall into depression.  \n\nCaring for a parrot is not a passive activity. Taking him in will significantly alter your work environment. So this is a really bad idea for both you and the parrot.\n\nI worked with an office parrot. It was very distracting, and often at the most inopportune time.  Don't di it.\n\nTell anyone who are siding with him to open up their homes to the lonely parrot.\n\nYour neighbor needs to find a suitable home for this lifelong companion.", "That's not a small favour...

Birds are very social creatures and he\u2019s basically on or around me all day.  For many meetings, I have to change locations because he is in a mood and will be disruptive.

One, not your bird. Two, the bird could bond to you and give the owner trouble which would suck. Three, your are right... birds can be distracting when you work from home. I'm babysitting my parents cockatiel while they are camping. I wfh & most of the workday he is downstairs with the other birds (finches & a dove) watching cartoons. I bring him upstairs to spend time with him but I've tried having him at my desk while I work. While I have room because I bought a huge desk, the bird talks, throws seed at me when he get board, an yells when he feels he's not getting enough attention. It's distracting and you don't want clients to hear a yelling bird in the background...", "NTA. How entitled can he be to think that his NEIGHBOR owes him daily pet sitting just because you work from home?? The rest of your neighborhood is out of their mind too to agree with him. Hold your ground and ignore him. He has no right to expect you to take care of his pet. \n\nYour other option is you could always ask for the same pay he would have to pay for a pet sitter if you want to make some extra money and he actually takes you up on it lol But you have no obligation to watch someone else's pet, end of story.", "NTA.  The other neighbors can babysit it then.  Honestly, you realize you don't have to have anything to do with any of them, right?", "NTA. Birds require a lot of love attention and care. Especially a parrot, which can live a long time. If your neighbor can\u2019t give that, then they need to find support from people that know a lot about birds", "NTA. The brainlessness of some people is amazing.", "NTA. Birds are a weird pet. It\u2019s not like he asked you to feed his cat for the weekend. I work from home and have a dog. But I\u2019m not going to watch my neighbors dogs everyday.", "NTA you can refuse to babysit his parrot without any reason.", "NTA - you are Work from Home, not babysit parrot from home.", "NTA.  Birds are a lot of work and are very loud and smelly (and would make your whole place smell.  I've had birds, worse than cats or dogs by quite a bit in terms of odor).   You didn't choose to get a bird, so why should you be responsible for one?   Presumably he didn't offer to pay you for your labor...", "As a bird owner, this would be a terrible idea. That bird will scream and you won\u2019t be able to focus. I would never leave my bird with someone who doesn\u2019t know how to take care of a bird. You could do something innocent like spray some air freshener and the bird dies, because you don\u2019t know all the things that are dangerous for a bird. Or the bird gets attached to you and screams when it goes home. Or it doesn\u2019t like you and screams nonstop or bites you.", "Who would want to listen to a parrot all day that isn't theirs?

When I read the title, I fully expected it to be a short term pet sitting situation. Like pop in and make sure the bird has food and water while the neighbor is gone a couple of days. Even for that, you have every right to say no, but this situation, yeah that\u2019s a hard no.", "NTA. Tell your neighbors to keep the parrot, if they\u2019re so invested in what is clearly none of their business.", "NTA\n\nIf it\u2019s not a big deal, why can\u2019t he take birdie to work? \n\nYou\u2019d think since this whole shift to so many more WFH situations, others would start understanding we are still working. We aren\u2019t just hanging out & able to do 101 other things for everyone who can\u2019t cause they are working. \n\nAnd if the neighbors don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, they can help him.", "NTA.\n\nParrots are loud, messy, and demanding. You have to be really committed to birds to keep them. He's asking too much. Maybe some of the neighbors who think you're being unreasonable would like to take turns.\n\nJust curious -- was he willing to pay or did he expect you to do this for free? I googled bird sitters in my area of Virginia and found the rate is $14 - $25 per hour.", "NTA.\n\n>He got upset, saying I\u2019m home anyway,\n\n\"Yes. I'm home...working. Which takes focus. I don't want a distraction while I'm working.\"\n\nOr, alternatively, agree to babysit it for $15/hour.", "NTA. Beyond what every one is saying, and that are all good points, I would not want to take on the liability.  What if something happened to the bird?  If it became I\u2019ll through no fault on your part he sounds like someone who would blame you.", "NTA, and you need to set this boundary now. \"Work from home\" does not mean \"my time is available for everyone's use.\" That especially includes petsitting and babysitting.", "Excellent point. Those parrots can live as long as people too.", "It's way more then five feet, I swear. I have multiple parrots, and I have to vacuum and \"de-poopy\" the living room every day. There is poop in places you wouldn't even imagine it possibly ending up, it's honestly like their butts are in another dimension entirely.", "100% this. I once lived with roommates who used to babysit their friend's parrot when they went away. It was, indeed, a really cool bird and very interesting to interact with. But the mess...holy (parrot) crap the mess. I had NO IDEA. It also needed a lot of time and attention; for me that part was fun but I'm guessing it would be a lot less fun in the middle of a work Zoom meeting. OP is definitely NTA, but it doesn't sound like the poor parrot's going to be all that happy with its owner.", "Why do so many people think if you WFH, you\u2019re there doing nothing all day?", "you sound like someone who has never met a parrot", "Some parrots have a vocabulary of 1000 words, so maybe.
