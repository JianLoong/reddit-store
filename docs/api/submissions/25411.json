I picked up some pre-made sushi for my lunch the next day. He went to work before I did so I cleaned around the house. I opened the fridge to put some energy drink cans inside and realized the sushi was gone. I text him asking him if he took it and he said yes. I didn\u2019t get upset and just moved on with my day.

He asked why I was still upset. I let him know that I was not upset that he ate the food. I was upset about the lack of communication. He asked why he has to communicate to eat food since we are not roommates. I told him that if it was food we always have at home then it would not be a big deal, but we don\u2019t always have sushi or cheesecake in the fridge. I don\u2019t care that it was eaten.

You didn't tell him any more than he told you.\n\nIn the future you should write your name on things you want reserved and this shouldn't be an issue.", "NAH if he was smart he would pick you up a piece of cheesecake on the way home as a piece offering. I'm going to get hate for this, but I think you're both right. It's a shared home, so he shouldn't have to tell you every time he eats something. But also looking forward to something special really sucks when it's gone. I guess I just personally buy enough for both of us or at least ask if my husband would also like lunch for tomorrow or an extra after work treat. If you were buying 2 portions of everything and he was eating it all, then I think you'd have more of a case. If my husband bought chocolate for himself and didn't think about asking me, I'd be sad. \n\nSo he's wrong for not realizing that something in the fridge might be something you're looking forward to.

I\u2019m sure he will see labeling or her writing  a \u201chey that\u2019s MY cheesecake\u201d text or note as roommate behavior.", "The sushi in particular was a planned lunch. Do you ever buy lunch just for yourself or do you always buy enough to feed everyone in your household? Do you ever go out to lunch without them?", "I don't agree with that. My husband buys things for himself (energy drinks) I buy things for myself, my 16 year old buys stuff that's just for her. No big deal. She didn't say she went on a household grocery run. BUT if she HAD and was doing the shopping, she's absolutely entitled to buy herself something. What a weird thing to say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also get mad when my husband takes my left overs b/c he's too lazy to pack them up the night before like I do.", "I'm with you. Both their behaviors seem strange and dumb to me, especially If money is no issue here. this is either a communication issue and or a respect of boundaries issue.\n\nIf OP: 1/ If I knew my husband and kids liked sushi or cheesecake, my instinct would be to get enough for the family, rather than an individual serving for myself only. 2/If I was saving something, whether for myself or to take a dish to an event, etc. - I would label the item with a note that says \"don't eat\" and an exp date for the item.\n\nIf Husband: If there was a single serving of something \"special\" that I knew my wife was saving for herself, and I knew she'd be upset that I took it, I wouldn't keep taking it and other's and then ask why she's mad?", "He isn't telling her that he didn't eat it, she did and she's imagining that someone else did, etc.", "He\u2019s stealing her special food and he\u2019s a jackass for thinking it\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not trying to blame her for anything and there\u2019s no abuse. It\u2019s really just not that deep, dude.", ">he is actively attempting to manipulate her into believing that her feelings of anger are misplaced and inappropriate due to the nature of their relationship.\n\nThey\u2019ve had one conversation. One. And it was just a few words, not even enough for him to begin to manipulate anything. Not everything is the big new shiny word that came back down the chute last year. Sigh.", "Yeah, but she might get to actually eat her treats without her husband taking them.", "you think like I do.  Love it!", "If my husband went to the store for cat food, asked if I needed anything, then decided to buy himself a treat, yes, I would have expected a text for that specific treat or for him to buy me one. When he asked first I would have been thinking of things we are running out in the house, not treats.\n\nIf he ate ice cream while he was out, I wouldn't mind/care because he shouldn't deny himself a treat just because he has other things to do before getting home or it might not be feasible - and he is not going to be eating it in front of me while I didn't get a chance to get some or say no.\n\nBut I think you and I might both be right and just looking at it from different lenses/perspectives as you mentioned. My dynamic with my husband is like that, we both would have asked or brought extra. We both contribute equally to the household, and I don't feel like I carry the emotional load. We both do little things like bringing a treat or doing something for one another as ways to express love - therefore for me, having my husband bringing home a treat without thinking of getting some for me or the kids feels thoughtless/hurtful.\n\nBut to your point, if OP's relationship is one where she carries most of the load in chores, kids, and all the planning/organizing, and he doesn't ever do any gestures for her (buying a treat, thinking of her, helping beyond his share to help out) I could see how it would be upsetting that he doesn't do anything for her, therefore she doesn't do anything for him (in terms of love gestures) and the time she tries to do something for herself, it gets taken away. Then again, the problems here are larger than a slice of cheesecake.", "Because when she asked him if he had eaten the sushi, she never followed up with anything to indicate she was angry at him for eating it... How is he supposed to know she was saving it for herself if she makes zero effort to communicate with him?", "Hold up, you think it's totally cool to buy a $30K vehicle for yourself without talking to your SO... but buying some $7 grocery store sushi without talking to them is selfish?\n\nEdit: Not trying to do a gotcha question here, this just seems like a weird line in the sand to draw at food", "If there was suddenly one piece of cake I would assume my husband already ate his. I would check  before eating it, but I would assume it's mine based on prior instances.", "Lol", "Are they British by any chance because that\u2019s some top level sarcasm. Still, it came with double cookies so why not\u2026", "Unless you\u2019re up for work while the other person is still sleeping\u2026", "Yup always leave the last serving/piece if you didn't buy it/make it.", "There shouldn't even have to be any communication.\n\nIs it your food? No, it clearly fucking isn't so don't touch it!!!", "Devil's Advocate: She didn't tell him it was hers and sometimes its fair to assume your partner also bought you something as well... Why didn't she tell him not to touch it? Communication is a two-way street.", "Oh dear. I can't figure out whether to vote this comment up... or down! \ud83d\ude02 I agree with your last two paragraphs 100%. But I don't necessarily agree that there shouldn't be any 'food boundaries' between couples. I think if I'd opened the fridge to see just one item that I had no prior knowledge of, I'd absolutely assume it was something he'd bought for himself until informed otherwise. Likewise, if I'd purchased something and found half missing, I'd be less than pleased.", "I cope with anxiety with snacks. My teen children know to ask if it's mine or everyone's. And we're a family living together, not just roommates. Your husband is taking you for granted, and thinks you'll stick around no matter what he does. He either needs to go back to dating you, or you need to tell him why his dismissal of your needs is bad.", "As I said, my argument would then  be that he was hard headed enough to repeat the offense, he must need it spelled out for him. She really shouldn't back down on this bc what I've learned is that people will treat you however you let them. If she bends on this, it just keeps going further and further until she has  no boundaries to protect anymore. And at some point, you have to stand up for yourself. You should do it while it's a small thing so it doesn't blow up too big on a bigger issue later. \nBut a bigger question is why doesn't he have any consideration for his spouse? Is OP the one taking care of everything around the house and the kids too? (or maybe I'm just projecting from my own miserable experience, but it just sounds like something I've been through).... \nBut, either way, I would suggest that he takes her for granted - either knowing she won't say or do anything about it and will  back down as usual, OR that it doesn't matter to him even if she does. \nI'd want to find out which of these it is sooner than later tbh before you turn around in 15 years and wonder why you're burnt out and unhappy with your relationship.", "I was just thinking of the bright colors of a post it to be sure it was noticeable, and taped on so he couldn't use the \"it must have fallen off\" excuse. ;)", " How many times you go to the store and get yourself lunch or desert and not ask your spouse if they wanted any?

OP should just \"get over it.\"* \n\nThus, the guy's gaslighting that the problem isn't really real. He implies that for OP to be upset about something that isn't real and thus has zero importance, ***she*** is being ridiculous.", "He\u2019s suggesting her being upset is due to her being immature and that SHE needs to grow up. How is that not blaming her?", "One serving of uncommon food in a home, as you can see from the comments, is an unspoken given.\n\nAlso, why isn't anyone who keeps trying to make his selfishness her fault asking why didn't he communicate by asking her first, like a normal and respectful person would?", "No, it was 3 of my husband's friends and all of them are from the states except one who is from China. I honestly laughed my ass off at the card though. I still think it was hilarious!", "I thought we were talking about the \u201cshitty fast food\u201d cheesecake\u2014he ate that during daylight hours when he could have asked OP.

If she does not communicate that she bought a special treat for herself, I don't know how you guys expect him to instantly realize that when he sees something he also likes to eat in the fridge... It's entirely possible that she is gaslighting him by setting him up for failure.
