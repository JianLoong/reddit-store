He asked why he has to communicate to eat food since we are not roommates. I told him that if it was food we always have at home then it would not be a big deal, but we don\u2019t always have sushi or cheesecake in the fridge. I don\u2019t care that it was eaten.

I'd tell him or text him if he's not around, and ALSO put my name on the food, just to be extra clear. If it still goes missing, then you have bigger problems in your relationship. \n\nAlso, you say you were not upset that he ate the food, but at the lack of communication.

It wasn't just eating something he had to know wasn't for him since you know...he didn't buy it. It was his complete dismissal of your feelings or acknowledge why you would be upset.  Even an apology and stating he would ask in the future. Is he always so dismissive of your feelings? NTA", "NTA. Eating single servings bought by someone else is an asshole move whether you're colleagues, roommates, or spouses.

When something different or special shows up in the fridge or pantry, it is a courtesy to inquire whether it is available for all or there for a special reason. The fact that he ate your sushi and then ate the cheesecake the very next day shows a lack of consideration.

It's sushi and a *slice* of cheesecake. That's obviously a food meant for yourself. If he wanted it, he'd need to ask. That's just common courtesy.

I text my wife. And then if she says 'yes' I eat it, and if she says 'no' I don't. And that's the end of it.

Unless you always have sushi and cheesecake in the fridge, it was clearly something you bought special, right? I mean if he was also dying for cheesecake and saw one slice, he can assume you bought it for yourself and ask to share...good grief. So weird. I love sharing food, I get a thrill and would probably give my husband the last of something, but it would just never occur to him to eat a single portion of something we don't normally buy that was clearly for me.", "NTA - you are owed an apology.

Maybe next time you get food you ask him if will want some or just double up when you get yours.", "You could buy enough for both of you and put a post it note on one saying, \u2018this one\u2019s for you, baby.\u2019 Problem solved.", "ESH - He obviously shouldn\u2019t have just eaten it and should have checked with you first. \n\nI think you could have got him some when you bought yours though, especially if you aren\u2019t usually keeping sushi and cheesecake in the house, I can see why he\u2019d be tempted to eat it. You also probably could have said that you put it in the fridge and it\u2019s not for him to eat rather than just leaving it there and not saying anything. Communication goes both ways.", "ESH: I say this because it's kinda ironic you're upset he didn't communicate with you but you didn't communicate with him why you were upset until he dragged it out of you.", "ESH \n\nIt was pretty obviously a special treat for you. But you know your husband likes that stuff, and it's \"not the usual food\". Why not offer to grab him some while you got yours?\n\n\nAlso, for all he knew, you did get and eat yours and left some there for him.", "NAH If sharing fridge food was the norm he wouldn't know those were reserved for you. You didn't tell him any more than he told you.\n\nIn the future you should write your name on things you want reserved and this shouldn't be an issue.", "NAH if he was smart he would pick you up a piece of cheesecake on the way home as a piece offering. I'm going to get hate for this, but I think you're both right. It's a shared home, so he shouldn't have to tell you every time he eats something. But also looking forward to something special really sucks when it's gone. I guess I just personally buy enough for both of us or at least ask if my husband would also like lunch for tomorrow or an extra after work treat. If you were buying 2 portions of everything and he was eating it all, then I think you'd have more of a case. If my husband bought chocolate for himself and didn't think about asking me, I'd be sad. \n\nSo he's wrong for not realizing that something in the fridge might be something you're looking forward to.
