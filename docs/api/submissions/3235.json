Can you report him even if he isn't your therapist though?", "It's up to the agency that receives the report if anything actually happens. If they think it's something to ignore, they will. If not, they'll take action. You're NTA for bringing this to their attention.", "NTA, but it sounded like you should rather report him of the veiled threat of digging dirt about you through his work.", "NTA and since he is trash talking you, I think you should report it because they need to see if he has accessed your records.", "Disagree with the other posts. The OP is a patient at the clinic that the idiot brother works at. She should report him.", "NTA but as others have said, he's not your therapist so I wouldn't expect much to happen.  Note that I'm assuming since you said you were on good terms that he already had your number before he started working at the clinic.  If he didn't, and he got it from clinic records, that's a whole different story.\n\nHowever, if you change you number and choose not to give your new number to him, you would be within your rights to explain and ask your clinic to prevent him having access so he can't do it again.", "NTA but you don't have the grounds to do this. \n\nYour brother is not your therapist, so he's not breaking any professional rules by giving a family member your number. What he did was shitty and he is the AH, but you can't report him to anyone. He's family. Block your mom and sister ASAP.", "NTA, this honestly wouldn\u2019t be a hard decision if he wasn\u2019t your brother and I understand why this is hard for you, but this is completely immoral and ilegal. \n\nI don\u2019t know where you live, but most countries have laws prohibiting therapists to tell other people what you talked about during your sessions unless you expressed the desire to harm yourself or others. This law applies, of course, to family members too. I\u2019ve been going to therapy my whole life, I am 17 so still under my parents\u2019 legal responsibility, and my therapist isn\u2019t legally allowed to tell them anything talked about during therapy unless it falls into the exceptions mentioned above, she has never done so and explained this to me during our first session.\n\nYour brother violated therapist-patient confidentiality, just giving your number to your abusers is reason enough to get his professional license taken away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's not your therapist. He didn't look it up in their system, he already had it because he's your brother. What he did was totally in the capacity of your sibling relationship, so you have no ground to stand on.", "YTA.  If he used confidential medical records, my answer would be different.  If he was your therapist, my answer would be different.\n\nYour brother had your phone number.  He shared it with his sister.  Big lapse in judgement but not one made in his professional capacity.\n\nAll of that said, was your brother trash talking you in the texts?  If so, that would also make him the ah.", "I feel like you would be the asshole here. He acted like a jerk while being your brother, he isnt your therapist. If you feel like the revange is worth it, go ahead, but I don't think it will have the outcome you are looking for. Unless he received any details about your therapy through his job that he relayed to your sister/mom.", "If he accessed your records and shared that info with your family, then report him. Otherwise, change your number, let your therapist know what happened (do not imply, state or accuse your brother of getting the info from your chart) and see if there is a way to prevent him from accessing your chart. And most importantly, do not give your new number to your brother. YWBTA if you report him when you gave him your contact info. NTA if he accessed confidential patient info and shared it without your consent.", "If your brother shared any of your confidential information that he accessed at the clinic, you should definitely report him.  \n\nIf he only shared your phone number that he had because he's your brother, he hasn't done anything other than be a complete AH to you.  \n\nYou need to severely limit your contact with someone who would share your contact info with your abusers.  Definitely do not give him any information that you don't want shared.  He has shown you who he is and he can't be trusted.\n\nI am sorry for the hurt and disappointment that he has caused you.", "You are not his patient so none of that applies here.", "Absolutely report him. No question. NTA.", "Report him, he knows full well whats going on and did it anyways.\n\nNot sure he can be trusted in the line of work he is in. \n\nYou should be prepared for him to \"switch sides\" if this is what you are going to do. \n\nSorry to hear you got dragged back into your sisters and mums nonsense.", "It was wrong of him to give them your number, but he did not do it as part of job. It isn't like you were a random patient of his and he divulged your number to someone. So, IMHO, it would not be appropriate to report him to his employer.", "NTA. But the idea is terrible. Firstly, he is not your therapist. He is safe there.  Secondly, the abusers are your family. He can say shit like he really thought your sister wanted to apologize. Thirdly, it gives your family ammunition against you. Now you are attacking your poor brother or sth like this. Just go LC to your brother.", "I think it would depend on if the brother gave \"dirt\" that was in OPs file. Cause then that is cause for being fired.", "Agree. And NTA op", "Did the brother use his role as a therapist to gain or discuss confidential information?  No.  Not a violation.\n\nSo, you work at a hospital as a doctor and we are siblings.  Because we are siblings, we have each other\u2019s phone numbers.  You share my phone with an ex.  Should I file a complaint at the hospital because I had elective surgery there last week?", "He already had OP's contact information before then; he did not access it via the clinic.  They also do not have a professional relationship; ie, the brother is not OP's therapist.  That makes this a personal dispute and nothing that the clinic would be involved in.", "But OP says the brother already had her number and implied that it was given to him by OP not obtained from the clinic. He would be able to be reported if and only if he obtained the phone number from her patient file at the clinic.", "The brother is not his therapist there is no doctor patient confidentiality. You brother legally can\u2019t even be your therapist most likely.", "Also need info on this. If you're a patient of the practice he works for (and that's how he got your number), then HIPPA laws will encompass the entire practice and not just the therapist you're seeing. If he got it from you personally, outside of his job, then it's not.", "Still, their therapist shared their information to their brother who shared it to their abuser. Doctor patient confidentiality is still broken.", "Just saw where OP said bro had it before. Can't report him, but you should probably talk to your therapist. Not because of him, although it may wind up hurting his place within that practice. But because you're experiencing family trauma again.", "OPs post does not mention their therapist at all in the post. The brother just happens to be a therapist at the same clinic. As long as brother didn't obtain her phone number through her records he hasn't done anything \"wrong\" in the eyes of whatever board he's licensed through. This is a personal family matter not one of professional ethics. I'm a therapist and I know plenty of therapists who don't have the best judgment in their personal lives. I would suggest op change her number and change to another therapist not in that clinic if possible.", "There is no doctor patient confidentiality because they aren\u2019t doctor patient. They only shared information they already had. Was it wrong? Yes but they didn\u2019t share anything they learned from their job.", "As I said above, I think the problem with my comment is that I interpreted OP\u2019s description of the situation differently, but if what their siblings talked about was something only mentioned during therapy sessions then their therapist broke patient-doctor confidentiality by sharing it to their brother, maybe that went over OPs head by the time they posted this. I guess that depending on the board he\u2019s licensed in he could get penalized for resharing confidential information that was shared with him.", "Ok, I think we interpreted the post in very different ways, u/thatonenativechild did your brother share information only your therapist knew?"]}
