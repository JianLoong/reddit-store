If he was your therapist, my answer would be different.\n\nYour brother had your phone number.  He shared it with his sister.  Big lapse in judgement but not one made in his professional capacity.\n\nAll of that said, was your brother trash talking you in the texts?  If so, that would also make him the ah.", "I feel like you would be the asshole here. He acted like a jerk while being your brother, he isnt your therapist.

Otherwise, change your number, let your therapist know what happened (do not imply, state or accuse your brother of getting the info from your chart) and see if there is a way to prevent him from accessing your chart. And most importantly, do not give your new number to your brother. YWBTA if you report him when you gave him your contact info.

It isn't like you were a random patient of his and he divulged your number to someone. So, IMHO, it would not be appropriate to report him to his employer.", "NTA. But the idea is terrible. Firstly, he is not your therapist. He is safe there.  Secondly, the abusers are your family. He can say shit like he really thought your sister wanted to apologize. Thirdly, it gives your family ammunition against you. Now you are attacking your poor brother or sth like this. Just go LC to your brother.", "I think it would depend on if the brother gave \"dirt\" that was in OPs file. Cause then that is cause for being fired.", "Agree. And NTA op", "Did the brother use his role as a therapist to gain or discuss confidential information?  No.  Not a violation.\n\nSo, you work at a hospital as a doctor and we are siblings.  Because we are siblings, we have each other\u2019s phone numbers.  You share my phone with an ex.  Should I file a complaint at the hospital because I had elective surgery there last week?", "He already had OP's contact information before then; he did not access it via the clinic.

That makes this a personal dispute and nothing that the clinic would be involved in.", "But OP says the brother already had her number and implied that it was given to him by OP not obtained from the clinic.

Doctor patient confidentiality is still broken.", "Just saw where OP said bro had it before. Can't report him, but you should probably talk to your therapist. Not because of him, although it may wind up hurting his place within that practice. But because you're experiencing family trauma again.", "OPs post does not mention their therapist at all in the post. The brother just happens to be a therapist at the same clinic. As long as brother didn't obtain her phone number through her records he hasn't done anything \"wrong\" in the eyes of whatever board he's licensed through. This is a personal family matter not one of professional ethics. I'm a therapist and I know plenty of therapists who don't have the best judgment in their personal lives. I would suggest op change her number and change to another therapist not in that clinic if possible.", "There is no doctor patient confidentiality because they aren\u2019t doctor patient. They only shared information they already had. Was it wrong? Yes but they didn\u2019t share anything they learned from their job.", "As I said above, I think the problem with my comment is that I interpreted OP\u2019s description of the situation differently, but if what their siblings talked about was something only mentioned during therapy sessions then their therapist broke patient-doctor confidentiality by sharing it to their brother, maybe that went over OPs head by the time they posted this. I guess that depending on the board he\u2019s licensed in he could get penalized for resharing confidential information that was shared with him.", "Ok, I think we interpreted the post in very different ways, u/thatonenativechild did your brother share information only your therapist knew?", "You absolutely need to report him, it's an ethics violation for him, an employee, to pass out customer information to outside parties for personal interests.\n\nYou would be an asshole if you didn't report him", "If your brother had your phone number from you and he passed it on, then no, it isn\u2019t linked to his work. \n\nYou can tell your therapist and give it in writing that there will be a conflict of interest if your brother goes through or near your files.

Try to make sure that any medical information stored at the office is not something he can access -- as you can't trust that he won't share it.

Make sure your therapist knows your records need to be kept private. It's impossible to believe he is qualified to work there if he purposely causes a patient to be exposed to her triggers.

So they can help work out a plan to protect your information as you can't trust it won't escalate.", "Report your brother.\n\nIt probably won't be considered a violation of doctor patient confidentiality because he is not your therapist. It is a ethics issues though, especially if he knew about the abuse and enabled your abusers to get back into contact with you. That should make the clinic wonder if he can effectively treat patients or will he just enable his patients abusers to remain in contact with his patients. Does the clinic know that you are siblings- have  precautions been set in place where he can never access your records? \n\nI am sorry that you were betrayed by your brother. It's time to add him to the no contact list. Change your phone number and ask your therapist if you can still come to the clinic if you move. I would also talk to a lawyer to see if you could sue your brother for causing you harm by enabling the abuse cycle to start again. It's a long shot but he needs to know how badly he screwed up. As a therapist, he should know better.", "Info....did he have your number prior to him working at the clinic? Did he share medically privileged information in. Information you shared solely with your therapist?", "So, he had your number beforehand. That would not be a violation. The clear violation would be if he looked at your file from work and used that \u201cdirt\u201d to trash talk you to your sister.

You did the right thing reporting him.", "Report him.", "The brother could be charged with conduct unbecoming. You're an employee no matter what. It doesnt matter that they're brothers. If the one brother knew of the abuse, and even had the other brothers phone number(which is seems like it), for that other brother to give the brothers abusers is a PR nightmare waiting to happen. The conduct unbecoming comes in as the company the brother works for provides therapy for these type of patients that were abused. It's a moral clause included in many employer/employee contract to work. And it doesnt matter that they had no professional relationship at the clinic. The brother works at the clinic, knows what services it provides, kniws his brothers abusive history. The brother lit the match fir the fire.The brother can be civilly sued, as well as the clinic.", "Yes.  HIPPA violation if this is in the US, and an AH move anywhere.  Report him and go NC.

Even him admitting OP is a patient is a violation of the standard and opens up the clinic to fines and more. \n\nWhether there is a pre-existing relationship or not, he is legally bound to not reveal any information.\n\nSo you seem to think that if you were my best friend as well as a nurse at the health clinic I use, you are free to tell my abusive ex that I have left, that I am being treated for pregnancy that I told you about outside of my clinic visit?  Guess again.  Besides suing you personally for divulging my information, I can sue your employer.  This is regardless of whether or not you told him whole acting as my provider or my friend.  Courts do not take divulging of private health information lightly \n\nThis is coming from someone who once worked as an administrative person at a large metropolitan hospital.  One of my medical billers told the spouse of a friend about her friend's mental health issues.  The multi million dollar lawsuit was a slam dunk for the patient.", "Not a violation, but as a therapist he should have a good understanding of what boundaries are and to respect them.

He is now one of your abusers.", "I worked in a pharmacy and my dad was a customer. A former co-worker of his asked for his contact information  but I didn't give it. I told them I would pass their info to him and he could contact if he chose to. I knew this person and they were friends but lost contact when he switched jobs. Yes, as his daughter I had his number but I wouldn't give it out without his consent", "Not sure if HIPAA (not HIPPA) applies here.\n\nThe brother already had the phone number and didn't access it through the patient records.

If your not sure go talk to whoever is in charge there and ask them hypothetically if this is behavior that should be reported.", "And it\u2019s not an actual violation if the brother had the number prior to starting and didn\u2019t access via the clinic\u2026.", "YNTA.  I do think you should tell your therapist what your brother did and get his/her guidance on how to proceed.  But, regardless, you should change your number, and do not give it to your brother.   If he cannot respect your boundaries, shame on him.  I hope you and he can rebuild your relationship,  but until that time, I would tell him he can email you if he wants to communicate or the two of you can set a weekly meeting for coffee and plan things that way.  But, keep your number private and focus on you, your mental health and happiness.  You deserve it.", "NTA, although I (PERSONALLY) feel that reporting your brother is over stepping since the situation does not have to do with his job. I do suggest that you sit down and talk with him on the subject, ask why he was so willing to give up information.\n\nI do suggest reporting your mother and sister for harassment if this continues -for they are truly- TA\u2019s", "Of course you wouldn\u2019t be the T A in this situation but I don\u2019t get why your brother would send you screenshots of him and your sister trash talking you if I read that correctly? but that piece of info makes no sense.", "NTA.   \nReport it. Let the powers that be decide if it was a problem. You're not the one making the judgement.", "NTA, and do it. IRL I am a clinical manger and this is full of \ud83d\udea9 regarding his clinical judgement that I would want to know about to protect you and other patients.\n1. He knows the origins of your PTSD and gave your number to your abusers. Whether or not he got that from your file is irrelevant\n2. He participated in bad mouthing you with your sister\n3. He then showed you that he had done so\n\nEverything about this raises real concerns about his judgement. Were I his supervisor, I'd want to be made aware of this so that I could have a serious conversation with him and evaluate his employment\n\nAnd to everyone posting that this isn't a HIPPA violation and therefore OP can't do anything, that's not the only potential issue here. Maybe the brother didn't do anything illegal, but what he did is unethical AF and just as big a problem that can open up the program to liability that can affect their license and/or accreditation to operate", "NTA. He broke the confidentiality even if it\u2019s not illegal where you are. I know what he did is illegal here under HIPPA. Besides that, WTF went thru his head showing you those hurtful messages?

Being mad at him and trying to get him in trouble at his job is a fools tasks unless you have proof he actually did something.", "Have you even read the HIPAA paperwork you routinely sign at doctor's offices? I have.  It asks me to write to who they have permission to give medical info.  I always list my husband and mom.  If someone in that office or is within the medical system that has those records gives info to my sister, they are in violation of HIPAA even if I'm not in their direct care.", "Isn\u2019t keeping patient records private something taught to when getting your license? \n\nLike my therapist wouldn\u2019t even tell my mom anything I mentioned in therapy when we did dual therapy.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, it is a violation because he works where OP goes to therapy. Everyone who works with health is bound by HIPAA, so no excuses from brother", "But he didn\u2019t say she was a patient. He provided her phone number, which he knew before working there.", "He\u2019s bound from giving out info he got from the clinic. He\u2019s not bound to confidentiality for everything he knows outside his job.", "NTA. He violated protocol", "I don't know why everyone is downvoting you, it's 100% correct. His brother working at the clinic had nothing to do with his giving out the number. He already had his brother's number and didn't give out any information he obtained because he worked there, or even any information he learned after working there. \n\nI'm not defending the bother or saying what he did was right, but it has nothing to do with HIPPA.", "I think you misunderstand the facts.  OP shared her phone number and personal medical information with her brother.  After that time, and very recently, brother became a therapist where OP was treated.\n\nBrother shared her phone number with their sister.  Information which brother had prior to being employed in the practice.  Information that came from OP outside of the medical setting.\n\nThere was no sharing of any PHI or PII information provided to or gathered by the clinic.  \n\nAn analogy:  you and I have been friends for 20 years.  We visit often and we have the contact information for each other.  I have been treated for a chronic condition at a major medical center for the last 15 years.  You just got a job there.\n\nYou give my mom my phone number.  A phone number you have known for 15 years.  You don\u2019t disclose that you are being treated at the same place you work.  You don\u2019t access any of my medical records.  You disclose information I shared with you in a personal capacity prior to you even being employed at the place I get treatment.  How did you violate HIPAA?", "Not a legal or ethical violation.  He didn\u2019t use confidential information and he wasn\u2019t the therapist caring for OP.\n\nWas it horrible judgement?  Absolutely.  As a therapist by training, should he know better?  Absolutely.  As a friend, should he have known better?  Absolutely.\n\nSo yea, shitty but  almost certainly not a violation of either HIPAA or licensing standards.", "So by that logic, if my friend worked at a clinic I go to she wouldn't be allowed to tell our mutual friend I like the show Breaking Bad?", "If TV shows are your personal and confidential information then yeah she would. But since they\u2019re not, she wouldn\u2019t. In this instance, phone numbers are personal and confidential information which are *not* allowed to be disclosed.", "Report him.  Let the investigators (not random Redditors) decide whether or not this is a violation and if so to what extent it is a violation.  Also separately raise it with his employer as a customer complaint.

His work should know about this", "NTA\n\nREPORT him. ASAP.   Put him in a non-related role and read what you said.  You have to report him.  You have every right to be angry.  He has no filter even sharing what they said about you as if he he is proud of something.  He needs to be in therapy.", "Nailed it.", "Not saying it's a professional violation by any means. This is a personal violation. He knew better. He knew there was a boundary. As someone who probably spends a good portion of his day talking to people about boundaries he 100% knew better."]}
