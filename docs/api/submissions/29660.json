This happened last thursday.\n\nMy SIL called my phone so I hung up the call and she sent me several messages that demand that I'm going home as she was in labor and needed someone to take her.\n\nI said I was working and couldn't leave for the next hour, but that she could call an Uber or ask a friend for help because I can't at the moment.\n\nShe seemed irritated and replied: \"Your nephew will be born, your work can wait  to help more family\"\n\nMe \"I'm sorry, but I'm busy and I can't\"\n\nHer: \"Don't you think your nephew isn't more important than this?\"\n\nMe, without patience and needing to focus: \"Not right now, ask someone else for help.\"\n\nI turned off the phone and in fact, it took a whole day.\n\nMy nephew is healthy, my SIL got a ride with a friend of hers who lives \"close\" (15 minutes) to home.\n\nI am being criticized by my parents and brother for refusing to help her and choosing my service and even though I say it was unfortunate, because it was just the only day in 3 months that I couldn't help that she went into labor , it didn't do any good because they are saying that I showed my true colors and that it was clear that my work comes first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698270080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gfyez/aita_not_helping_my_sil_in_labor_and_continuing/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, she can do almost everything by herself. But when a woman is in labor, she also needs mental support. I understand OP is not very close to her but at least they are relative, family and acquaintance, not a complete stranger. It is completely normal to seek support to Op when no one else is around.

It's pure hypocrisy. If you were the lawyer's client you'd be betrayed and furious;\n2. You are completely ignoring that the lawyer has an ethical and professional duty to their client.

He hints at it but backs off. And if he was on trial he could alert the judge, have the judge continue the case until the next day or for an hour, and tell the jury that there was an emergency for one of the parties. If the judge refused, his duty to his client would demand he stays. (And I think every single person who hires a lawyer wants that devotion).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you're probably right.

They COULDN'T yet.", "Would you still take her if it meant leaving court, pissing off the judge, wasting an entire day for everyone involved, blowing the case and potentially being disbarred?", "Don't you think an ambulance or an Uber would be quicker than having someone leave work?", "Then both her and her husband needed to set up a plan for when it happened. Unless it was a premature birth, they both knew the time-frame the kid could be born in, and should have planned it better", "You might think the person going into labor might set that up with her husband and in-laws.", "Then she should have called the uber first.", "Do you know how dangerous labor and delivery CAN be?  Not is!  I delivered both sons naturally without problems or drugs. \n\nSomeone in labor WANTS a support system. The medical staff is there for people who need it. \nAlthough I have no experience with medical staff in other countries so I won\u2019t assume.", "Edit: NTA.\n\nOriginal:\n\nYeah, but what specifically during the time in question? Why are you dodging reasonable questions? Y T A", "I'm a trial attorney.  Depending on the court's rules (some require phones to be left at the office or placed in a lockbox, or even just turned off and kept out of sight), or the judges requirements, it is entirely possible to text on your phone if you are not actively dealing with a witness or argument. It is in fact a common way to give instructions to support staff just outside the courtroom for something needed in the courtroom.\n\nIt's much easier to do in a courtroom where counsel is permitted to have a laptop and use court wifi or personal hotspot.", "Not trying to be too much of a jerk, but you don't a thing. \n\nYou can't write/text a simple sentence so how can you judge this fairly? \n\n\"Look, I don\u2019t a thing about court room procedure, I\u2019ve never been in court myself, but I can\u2019t imagine Op would be texting in the middle of a trial.\"", "Based on OP having a text conversation spanning several minutes before turning off his phone, I assumed not in court.  If he was actually in court, I imagined that phone would be off or judge would be pissed at the beeping and texting.", "I'm not a lawyer but isn't this one of those few opportunities to ask for a recess? If he asked and got denied, that's one thing but if not, that's just callus. And if you're able to text her back 3 or 4 times, can't you text someone to come help?", "OP doesn't say he's in court, just working on a jury case.  Based on his description it's doubtful he's actually in court. His phone rang, he talked to SIL, then had a span of text messages before turning it off. No judge would allow that.", "I don't think there is enough information presented. I think maybe he was the plan and back-up plan. The parents shouldn't have gone out of town so close to the due date, yes, but I don't know the culture of the poster. Communication is the biggest issue here for all of them, but there could also be a thing where one of the parents is handicap. I still think OP is YTA, but communication is what caused all of this mess.", "I would doubt 100% as it\u2019s up to the judge.", "No not at all. The opposite actually. That I have no idea about the legal system in the US, and that other countries (like mine) may be more strict. Tbh it could be possible in my country as well, but depending on the situation I think it's more of a grey area honestly.", "honestly that depends on a lot of factors, the witness availability time of trial, the jurors. if OP was originally apart of the birthing plan they. could have informed the judge ahead of time. but since that wasnt the case we dont know what kind of damage that could have done to stop the trial at that point.", "It's not. No. He didn't give enough info. He hinted that maybe it's trial-oriented but the dude didn't say whether he was in fact sitting in a court room running a trial when this happened.", "He\u2019s also a grown adult, and it\u2019s fairly irresponsible to completely turn his phone off during a medical emergency, and that she was fairly fortunate to have some else come get her. But if she didn\u2019t? Best case scenario if she couldn\u2019t get to the hospital, he\u2019d have blood and amniotic fluid all over his floor and ruined towels. Worst case scenario? Either she, the baby, or both would\u2019ve been dead. \n\n\nI get it: not his wife, not his kid. I\u2019m not saying he had to drop everything right then and there and run to her aid. I\u2019m just saying it could have gone a lot worse than it did, and that turning his phone off as one of her few contacts in town was a bad thing.", "Did I say he had to drop everything to get her or did I say turning his phone off was irresponsible?", "No one used Plan A.", "Came here to say this.", "OP may not be legally allowed to *answer* more in depth questions about the case or proceedings.\n\nI'll ask you this, *why didn't SIL have a birth plan in place?*", "Thank you for the extra insight, it\u2019s very appreciated.", "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a jerk,\u201d you say while being a pedantic asshole about a typo.", "If you had no involvement in the impregnation.

SIL did it.", "How many people besides OP didn't plan for that situation? At least 4.\n\nYou are blaming him though with your judgement. If the family plans a trip to Portland without telling OP, it's his fault when he gets called to help out there?", "Agreed, I just felt that the absence of information was suspicious.

I just think he's the asshole for turning off his phone and not offering a solution. I know he doesn't like his SIL, but I think that maybe he needs to understand where the SIL is coming from. His brother should not be working overseas for an indefinite amount of time because that child could reach majority by the time his father returns home. The parents did not communicate with the son and DIL about contingencies. She should have had a plan in place for circumstances like this one, but no one made plans. The parents were too reliant on the son, but that could be the cultural thing that I mentioned since I am unaware of the OP's nationality. I know for some cultures, this would be extremely frowned upon on his part. Ambulances  might not be able to reach in time. He still could have called an Uber for her. Let's be honest with that. He could have texted his parents as well to see if they had any idea when they might be home. The SIL gave no time for the contraction times. It's the first kid, so she's going to be tightly wound. The SIL shouldn't have yelled. It's stressful for everyone.", "No I\u2019m generally of the opinion opinion that no one planned for this, though I\u2019m giving a pass to the brother because I get the sense he\u2019s military and deployments aren\u2019t something you can plan for. \n\nLike I said, I think it\u2019s irresponsible on OP\u2019s part to turn his phone off during a medical emergency just as the parents are irresponsible for going out of town right around the due date and making Op the labor plan.", "You literally said my judgement couldn\u2019t be trusted because of a single typo; how is that not being pedantic?", "And you didn't tell OP? Shame on you.", ">I said I was working and couldn't leave for the next hour, but that she could call an Uber or ask a friend for help because I can't at the moment.\n\nBut he did offer a solution \\^", "I guess I just don't think someone else's \"emergency\" is his problem. \n\nMay sound jerkish but to him his job is more important than being there for his SIL. Unless he told them he would be willing to help it's kinda unfair to just assume he would.", "Is it because no one had a plan? Lady giving birth didn't have one. \n\nWe're talking the hardest,  most stressful thing in her life. Physically,  mentally,  hormonally. She had no plan.\n\nOP doesn't know anything here. And you blame OP.", "If her contraction were close, which they weren't as he stated it took a day for her to deliver. He didn't explain why he couldn't either. Communication. Number one thing here.

Call emergency services!\n\nHe's not a doctor. Are you going to call IT next time you have a medical emergency? \n\nHe was irresponsible for not preparing for his SIL'S birth. He knew nothing about it and he should have just known to quit work."]}
