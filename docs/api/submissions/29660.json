This happened last thursday.\n\nMy SIL called my phone so I hung up the call and she sent me several messages that demand that I'm going home as she was in labor and needed someone to take her.\n\nI said I was working and couldn't leave for the next hour, but that she could call an Uber or ask a friend for help because I can't at the moment.\n\nShe seemed irritated and replied: \"Your nephew will be born, your work can wait  to help more family\"\n\nMe \"I'm sorry, but I'm busy and I can't\"\n\nHer: \"Don't you think your nephew isn't more important than this?\"\n\nMe, without patience and needing to focus: \"Not right now, ask someone else for help.\"\n\nI turned off the phone and in fact, it took a whole day.\n\nMy nephew is healthy, my SIL got a ride with a friend of hers who lives \"close\" (15 minutes) to home.\n\nI am being criticized by my parents and brother for refusing to help her and choosing my service and even though I say it was unfortunate, because it was just the only day in 3 months that I couldn't help that she went into labor , it didn't do any good because they are saying that I showed my true colors and that it was clear that my work comes first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698270080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gfyez/aita_not_helping_my_sil_in_labor_and_continuing/", "score": 467, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, she can do almost everything by herself. But when a woman is in labor, she also needs mental support. I understand OP is not very close to her but at least they are relative, family and acquaintance, not a complete stranger. It is completely normal to seek support to Op when no one else is around.

He hints at it but backs off. And if he was on trial he could alert the judge, have the judge continue the case until the next day or for an hour, and tell the jury that there was an emergency for one of the parties.

I think OP has spun this story.\n\nOne, it's highly unlikely the court wouldn't allow a recess or a continuation into the next day, even in a large case. Lawyers and judges and jury members are all human. There are plans in place for if someone necessary has an emergency. \n\nTwo, an Uber or taxi driver may well refuse to drive a pregnant woman. Labor and birth are messy. Drivers aren't all the good Samaritans you see in movies.\n\nThree, there's a reason she called the brother before the friends. We have no idea if they're staying close to where she usually lives and if she has close friends nearby who can help her. Clearly they aren't near her family.\n\nFour, for those saying the brother/ parents are TA, we also don't know if the brother had a choice in working overseas and if it was close enough to SILs due date for the parents to have been overly concerned about staying close. Brother might be military and deployed, already on a contract with a break clause they couldn't manage, etc.\n\nIt would be helpful if OP shared: was he ever originally part of the birth plan, ie backup driver or support person if the parents couldn't be there? And in what country is he a lawyer if not the US, where he can have a phone while working with a jury but can't leave for a family member going into labor? \n\nChildbirth is a medically risky time, a vulnerable time, and there is a reason SIL called Op even if they aren't close. I can't imagine saying no to someone in that position and truly believing it is better that they potentially go through labor and birth alone, without any advocate or support, than have to tell the court there is an emergency and leave.\n\nYes, it might be more someone else's responsibility to be there for SIL for birth.

Sorry but my guy is new to the job and has rent to pay and is finishing building a house and imagine the cost of the furniture after he had to do what he had to do the phone off was necessary for no distractions", "Op did nothing wrong you obviously don't know how being a new lawyer in court works", "He's a young lawyer how much power do you really think he has and she HAD OPTIONS why didn't she just call her friend when op said no? She could've called her own Uber or a taxi it's poor planning on sil, op's parents and the brother", "Trial lawyers text all the time.  Not constantly, but it can be necessary.  To confirm a witness is in the lobby and ready to be called, things like that.  Smart watches make receiving communications less obvious.  And small breaks happen where phones can be used but you still can\u2019t leave or make/receive a call.", "100% agree.", "Well OP mentioned Uber, so they do.", "I was 24 when I graduate law school\u2026.. Took the bar and started my first job the same year", "I dated a doctor who had his MD at 24, it happens.", "[deleted]", "But were you the main lawyer? Or even better, the main lawyer fighting with someone over text in front of a judge and jury?", "The person that has the power is the judge. You could possibly postpone a court case because of this, if you weren\u2019t already in the room. And I don\u2019t see why OP would postpone a case to give ride to someone in the hospital they\u2019re not even close to? SIL could\u2019ve:\n\u2022Planned better\n\u2022Get a UBER\n\u2022Call to a friend", "Yeah you obviously know nothing about being a lawyer so basically to sum it up she could've called someone else he had a case that could make or break his career and they're not even close she should've had options he did what he had to he's in no way wrong in this situation end of story", "I was absolutely being pedantic. \n\nI fucked up here. That was my fault.", "I was done with law school at 21, it\u2019s completely possible to be the main lawyer at 24 if OP is like me with 3 years experience in a small law firm. The text part is weird still"]}
