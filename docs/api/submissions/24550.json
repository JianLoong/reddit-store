Or did you just have a go at her in advance?", "NAH.  You are 18 years old and about start college. You won't be growing up with your half sister.  It's normal for teenagers/young  adults to not be interested in babies unless it's their own. You also live with your dad so it's not like you will be coming home for visit and staying with your mom.

Just saying.", "NTA. You're already an adult and the baby isn't born yet. You'd never have a normal sibling relationship. It's not even a full sister and your mum didn't even care to think how her child would feel having retirement age parents before the baby is 20, so probably hasn't thought through other practicalities either. You don't live with her and have uni and your whole adult life to get going, you don't need someone else's baby to look after.", "Why did you even bring this up? You don\u2019t even  live with your, (now pregnant), mother. You are old enough to go off to college, which means you are not around any of your family at all. You will probably have very little contact with the baby, ever, really.\n\nYTA for even bringing this up. Your mama can have another child with a partner, and you don\u2019t have to like it. You don\u2019t have to like babies or small children. But this is pretty much a non issue, since you don\u2019t even live with your mom. \n\nSo what if the baby is brought to some family event? You can sit at the far end of the table and frown for the duration of the meal or whatever.

It\u2019s your half sibling and no one has pushed anything on you.\n\nBut even if she had\u2026 I am not a big fan of kids, my kids and siblings are a whole different thing!  But again, no one has even asked you to do anything.", "YTA", "YTA. It will be difficult to explain to your youngest sister why you suddenly want her in your life when she turns 8. Whatever the problem you might have with your mother, do not let that child bear the brunt of it.", "YTA. This is a pretty over the top reaction when the baby isn\u2019t even born yet. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything, but at the same time this is your family. You have to be willing to give and take. \n\nYou will need your moms help some day, with this attitude, don\u2019t expect it for free.", "Your nta, my daughter, is the same, me and my partner told my daughter she's 24 btw doesn't live with us that we were gonna try for a baby, she also said she wouldn't babysit or take the baby out and I totally respect that some people just aren't kid people and thats not a bad thing  but you coulda worded it better.", "I'm going with YTA mainly because you are hurting your own self, and you don't even realize it. \n\nWhile you are not obligated to be a free babysitter, choosing to have nothing to do with your sister will mean you are missing out on what could be a fabulous meaningful relationship in your life. \n\nI know a guy who was 20 when his sister was born and they are best buds. (She is 8 now) Don't let your stubbornness deprive you of that happiness.", "YTA and will probably grow into one of those toxic child free people.", "Major YTA here. How dare someone take kids on an airplane to discomfort poor little ole you. You're 18 and I'm finding you intolerable. The child isn't even here yet and you're already acting like an ahole.", "YTA. While I agree with other commenters that there shouldn't be an expectation that you'll drop everything as you're entering adulthood to be an on-call and unpaid nanny, it doesn't sound like anyone was suggesting that. Your mom probably wasn't expecting that \u2013 you don't live with her and you'll be at college soon anyway. It sounds like your mom (who is going through a geriatric pregnancy, btw, which you should google) just shared really huge news with you that she's probably really excited about. Whether she planned the pregnancy or not, most women cannot get pregnant at 46, so this may be sort of a miracle baby for her. And you responded by telling her  that in the future should she ever ask when you are home from college and not at your dads you will not even consider spending time alone with your little sister unless you are paid. You completely made her announcement (which she probably thought a lot about in advance) about yourself and made a joyful moment into a negative one. You should apologize to your mom for the way you responded. \n\nAlso, if you don't particularly enjoy kids, that's fine. Plenty of people don't. But if you are dead set on maintaining your \"kids are intolerable until the age of 8\" stance when it comes to your new sister, you are setting yourself up for problems for the next eight years. If you keep holding on to that mindset, you are probably going to keep being the asshole, and that is going to have big implications for your relationships with your current family members and for your relationship with the sister who is on the way. She will remember the big brother who ignored her as a kid when she grows up. That will leave a mark.\n\nTry to find a silver lining here and work on changing your internal dialogue when it comes to the baby.  Even if it takes you a while to come to terms with the baby sister of it all, you can be excited for your mom and her boyfriend. And honestly, you are probably going to love the absolute shit out your sister, and she won't just be an intolerable kid to you. She'll be *your* intolerable kid.", "NTA. I hate kids too and setting boundaries with your mother is the right thing to do.", "Nah exactly, as there's nothing wrong with disliking children and not wanting to be near them. But to outright tell her, you'll never do anything to help her kid, without ever being asked or it being mentioned is incredibley rude.", "NTA. You didn't say you didn't want to be in her life just that you don't want to have to deal with her as a baby. Most parents would love to have someone raise their kids through those times and pick them back up at like 5/6 when they're potty trained and manageable. Yes I'm a mom. Of four actually. \nAs long as you don't mistreat her when she is around. I don't get why people get so upset if someone doesn't like kids.

Not all kids are the same; I would personally babysit for free if my sister's easy, but if they're spoiled I'd ask for payment (and pretty steep if they are very spoiled). However, I suppose warning your mum to contact you only if you're the last possible choice is not a bad idea. I was a very quiet kid, my mum could take me to her work and I'd sit and play in silence for hours. I'd babysat kids that were a joy to get to know. And then, there was the kid who broke my glasses because I was trying to take him to school on time.

I'll adopt your format in pointing a few things out here:\n\n1. OP's sister will be a half sister, not a step sister. \n2. Half of modern marriages end in divorce, which means there are a LOT of \"step\" families out there, and there is absolutely no study or statistic that indicates they are \"amost always unstable.\"\n3. Are traditional families more likely to be stable across the board? \n4. Why would a big age gap that would create a relationship between OP and baby sister be negative? Are meaningful and positive relationships with older family members (e.g., an uncle, as you suggested) impossible?\n5. What would OP lose by creating a relationship with new sister?\n6. What would the repercussions of OP's refusal to engage with new sister be on the relationships with his other family members?\n\nOut of genuine curiosity, why are you playing devil's advocate here? u/newfriend836639 is just saying that preemptively refusing to engage with someone who isn't even born yet is shitty, and that OP has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking whatever role in baby sister's life works for him. Why did you balk at that?", "Tf u mean hot take? As I said, the original commentator expressed that OP's life is inevitably gonna be miserable and he's most definitely gonna regret not being involved with his sister. \n\nAnd to answer your points:\n\n1. Even if it was his full sister, my point stands.\n2. Unstable in terms of relationships - always. No matter the circumstances, if it came to a divorce that means there was a problem in the parent's relationship? No? No matter what the child custody looks like, they either suffer a relationship with one parent or both, there's no stabile outcome of divorce. & 3. Traditional as in? Married?? Toxic marriages ofc can be worse than divorce, but my point is stated in the previous point.\n\n4. It wouldn't be necessarily negative, but as I said, he's gonna be more of an uncle than a brother, and they're never gonna have that relatable sibling bond.\n\n5. Nothing, but y'all are turning it into a peer social pressure rather than something he wants, from what I understand.\n\n6. As we can see from the post, they aren't taking it in great, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter does it? He's ending/ed high school, by the time the sister grows to talk and is able to develop a relationship, he might be far off or close by but still living his life and/or working. The potential relationship in question isn't exactly around the corner, it's gonna be in 5yrs or more. \n\nI 'balked' at that because the commentator is socially pressuring OP to change his mind for the purposes of fitting the social image of a strong sibling bond, which could hardly happen in this situation for the reasons I listed, and even less considering OP's standing.", "NTA.
