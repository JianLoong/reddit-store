My best evil eye looks are for parents who walk out of a restaurant with their kids and leave their table and the floor under it a complete mess. What are they teaching their children?", "I work supermarket checkouts, we generally clean anything and everything. My one exception, for myself and any staff when I'm supervisor is bodily fluids. If someone leaves a biohazard in the bathroom I'll put up and out of order sign and block off the door, cleaning that is above my pay grade and I don't have PPE.", "I do think you're on to something with the specific way OP responded being the issue. I'm not a parent, but I have been a nanny and also worked in child care facilities/play places, so I've seen my share of gross kid stuff. I think my expectation would be to be handed a roll of paper towels, and be told that someone would be right over to help sanitize. (I'd expect that there's a chance that the person I told isn't the right staff member to help clean, or that they might need to go get PPE and cleaning supplies, etc). Something about \"cleaning supplies are behind you help yourself\" just feels very dismissive and unsympathetic. Don't get me wrong, mom absolutely should have been helping too. But if I were a fellow customer, I'd want staff making sure the area was properly sanitized for public use in a way that a parent trying to also manage a likely upset child probably won't accomplish.", "or maybe it's a service policy of allowing customers to be AHes to staff", "cleaning up normal messes is fine but i was never trained for cleaning biohazards and it\u2019s not in my job description. all my job descriptions stated basic cleaning such as sweeping/mopping, trash, cleaning up broken products and keeping the register area cleaned. if it\u2019s not in my job description it\u2019s above my pay grade they got me fucked up if they think the little money i\u2019m being paid will cover me cleaning human urine", "I would think that the store needs to actually clean it/mop anyway for those liability reasons (and having access to the better cleaning chemicals) but I'd at least try to clean up the visible evidence of the mess so it's less gross for the staff.", "Girl what. I've worked in retail and small businesses for most of my life and have never had a cleaner on staff. No one barked orders, the employee said \"Yes, please.\" If your child pisses on the floor you clean it up like a decent human being.", "When I worked at a national chain cafe we were all trained on biohazards, PPE, and proper procedures since it\u2019s an OSHA requirement.  It wouldn\u2019t usually fall the the person bussing to clean up anything like that including the bathrooms, although we never had an issue outside the bathroom.", "Vent their disgust at entitled/shitty parents who would dump their kid's piss on a table where others eat, you mean.", "You\u2019re already getting downvoted lmao. Figures. Just wanted to reply to say I agree with you and love your phrasing of \u201csalivating to vent their disgust at parents and children\u201d ! It makes reading any post or replies involving anyone who isn\u2019t childless painful in its own right", "If somebody comes at you immediately being a dick, you are not going to say \u201coh thanks for that\u201d. \n\nYour hackles are going to be up and you\u2019re going to be angry. So no, they\u2019re not going to say more unless it\u2019s to a manager about OP\u2019s attitude.", "You don't need special training to mop up a little bit of pee lol  \n\n\nI'll grant you this - it would be polite for the parent to apologize and offer to clean it up. They probably should do this. However, the cafe staff 1 million percent should insist on doing it themselves. It's just good customer service and it's the polite thing to do. As you said accidents happen, whether they be a spilled drink, a kid has an accident and some pee gets on the floor, a glass is broken, whatever... the establishment should always take care of this if they are a good business. Just as it would be unreasonable for the business to ask a customer to clean up a spilled drink or an accidentally broken glass, it's unreasonable for them to ask the mom to clean up the pee.  \n\n\nAlso worth nothing that kids having accidents like this are likely age 2-4 ish. The amount that they pee is a lot less than an adult. Plus a ton of it is gonna soak in their pants/underwear so by the time it gets to the floor it's a lot less, not gonna be a huge puddle.  \n\n\nWith the pet store having this policy is fine but it's WAY different for a number of reasons:\n\n1. This is a common policy at pet stores\n2. When your pet has an accident you don't need to bring them into the bathroom screaming and crying, clean them up and change their clothes before you even get to clean up the floor, which is 100x more time/effort than cleaning up the floor itself.\n3. The policy is established up front because it's an every-day occurrence with dogs.", "My daughter had a history of bad accidents like that. She was clean, but poo escaping her clothes somehow. We called her the great Poo-dini.", "> but a staff member shooed me away and cleaned it up.\n\nThey probably needed to follow specific cleaning and sanitation protocols. When I worked retail we had body fluid kits for situations where stuff that's in the body comes out. Even though it was the floor we still had to follow those protocols exactly. Wet wipes, soapy water, and paper towels would likely have only made it more difficult to clean.", "I was at a Starbucks when my daughter threw up. I was stunned. Before I could  blink there were two moms who jumped into action because since I was holding my daughter. And momentarily froze. Bless those ladies. They really helped out a new mom and i wanted to die less of embarrassment. I\u2019ve paid it forward many times.", "I worked at a kids gymnastics/play centre, and I still remember a little girl peeing, right next to where I was standing. The poor mum was mortified, and was trying to catch it in her hands. I laughed and told her that her kid picked a good spot, as she was on an easily cleaned mat, and went off to grab the cleaning supplies. I didn't mind at all (pee on a mat is easy compared to vomit on carpet), but she was very nice, apologised profusely and insisted on cleaning it. When you work at a kid's play centre, you expect accidents to happen though!", "\u201cOur comes the wet wipes\u201d I honestly thought she puked wet wipes for a sec", "I'm 24 and can barely handle a large shake without getting the gurgles!

Though I am sympathetic to the idea that he wanted to get her the best and have her enjoy it! Haha\n\nA small kid isn't going to even realize that it is more enjoyable to have a medium or small amount of ice cream than as much ice cream as you can possibly consume, since the shake would be totally great until the moment you feel sick", "My sister used to let her child make a horrible mess, and then get up and walk out, leaving it for the restaurant to clean up.\n\nShe was an inconsiderate mother in so many other ways too. Just expected everyone around her to take up for her slack of not taking care of her child.\n\nThen she was jealous that her child loved staying with grandma or an aunt more than she liked being with her mother.", "Literally.", "Agreed and also a nanny.", "n that\u2019s why i never did it. if i wasn\u2019t trained for it it\u2019s out of my pay grade and if i am trained i expect the extra compensation for being trained on it.", "Ah yes, who would dare be digusted by the type of parent who would dump their kid's piss on a table where others eat.", "Thanks, I appreciate it! I\u2019ll eat the downvotes, I just had to get that out there.", "The parents needs to adult up. An adult knows when they are wrong. OP wasn\u2019t full of attitude, they were efficient and clear.", "Absolutely. I\u2019m so sick of teenage retail workers who cop an attitude in advance every time a customer approaches.

Don't go outside.", "Ahh my nephew ruined my brother's favorite pillow. Diaper blowout. I still don't understand how either. Diapers have gathered legs. It doesn't seem possible but it is.

Totally random. And she was definitely way past the age of random kid barfing.", "It makes sense, if it is something that *can* be cleaned up by an amateur then they'll still have to clean up more after you attempt to clean it, and, worst case scenario, you could make a bigger mess trying to clean it due to being flustered and worried.\n\nA more serious accident might require actual professional cleaning, but if they can clean a public bathroom they can clean vomit.
