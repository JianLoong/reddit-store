The same way I would\u2019ve cleaned up that kind of mess at the kid\u2019s house if it had happened on my watch.", "NTA, but that does seem like something you should probably mop up from a health safety standpoint, and customers shouldn\u2019t handle mops from a safety standpoint. But that mom should\u2019ve been way more mortified, apologetic, and helpful.", "NTA.  But very close.  It was proper for parent to tell you about the mess.  It was wrong of customer to put that trash on the food table.  Your response was hilarious.  I can just hear hsr saying, \u201cwell, I never!\u201d   Hahahaha. Thanks", "As a staff, you have the right cleaning supplies.", "NTA for not being comfortable cleaning up bodily fluids. But you really shouldn't ask the customers to clean up either. There's a slip-and-fall liability for the business as soon as there's a wet spot on the floor, best practice is to put up a wet floor sign then have an employee with appropriate supplies and protective equipment clean it and let it dry. The customer did a crappy job which you had to re-clean anyway, plus they contaminated the table.\n\nPlease note, employers MUST provide you with protective equipment and training if bodily fluid cleanup is expected at all as part of your job. Urine isn't a big deal but you can get serious diseases from feces or blood. If you're not comfortable doing it, put up a wet floor sign and defer to the manager. I know it sucks but you can't trust customers to do an appropriate job cleaning up after themselves.", "They should have cleaned it up, but you should have made sure it was sanitized. Bodily fluids are hazardous waste. Gloves and masks should be worn. \n\nI think NTA but you need to ask your manager what the policy is and how to clean up this kind of mess.", "my dog peed in a pet supply store and i went up front to ask if they had anything so i could clean it and the girl said no worries & she would clean it. my point being that i can\u2019t imagine not cleaning up my child\u2019s or dogs or my own mess? that\u2019s super rude.", "If it was my store, I would want to clean it myself, just so I know it's done right.", "As a person who works with the public, they always offer but if you don\u2019t want urine on the floor you should probably do it yourself to know it was done right.\n\nIs there a you made a judgement error but they were the ass hole?", "I used to work maintenance at Walmart. Bodily fluids are a BIOHAZARD and have to be cleaned up with a special powder. If there\u2019s too much of the biohazard, the store is supposed to be shut down and the proper people called to do a clean up. NTA AT ALL WTF.", "Yeah, no. You can refuse to clean human waste. That\u2019s a biohazard. NTA", "She was probably thrilled to be the one to tell you thinking she wouldn't have to do it and you burst her bubble.\n\nIt's like people who go to department stores and throw clothing around. Under the guise of 'shopping'.  They relish the fact they aren't the ones who have to fold it.", "As a parent, I agree.\n\nThe only time this hasn't been the case was when I was at a hotel and they WOULDN'T give me the supplies to do it myself.\n\nBut I asked them to please please pass on my deepest apologies to whoever got stuck with the job.

Perfect storm of awful, and I felt so bad!!!)", "I was at a restaurant with a friend .Her little girl got sick, but before she could get her picked up and to bathroom, she puked all over the floor. Two waitresses cane running over, but my friend insisted SHE clean it up as it was HER child's bodily fluids and not in their job description.", "While all the stuff about the piss is true I disagree with the judgement.\n\n>I work in a cafe, and yesterday a woman came up to the counter and told me - ''My son has had an accident, it's just a little puddle on the floor..'' I should of let her finish but, I responded straight away with ''There's blue roll and anti-bacterial spray behind you.''\n\nOP cut her off mid sentence. That is incredibly rude. ESH", "Agreed. It's reasonable to ask for supplies, and to let the staff know because tbh they'll probably want to sanitize it more thoroughly anyway - but only after it's as clean as you can get it yourself. I can't imagine the entitlement to just go, hey, clean this up for me.", "And instead they put the pee on the table!", "Yeah thats bizarre to me. If I spill a drink when Im out I'll ask for a cloth to clean it up, I don't expect anyone to clean up after my clumsiness. This situation would be no different. \n\nMy sister has a small child who makes a mess while eating out, when we're finished she will always pick up all the food that has gone over the edge of the high chair.", "I was working as a cleaner at an event in these temporary but posh toilets (not potapotties like proper loos with sinks and everything). It was fine, two people did poop on the floor (gross) but it was all possible to handle and we had the equipment.\n\nThen we got a radio call to go to another area to \u201cclean up\u201d. Got there and it was a RAW SEWAGE LEAK. They said \u201cwell you guys are responsible for cleaning the toilets\u201d. We were pretty young (18?) and just sort of stared at the sewage and the guy. Luckily someone more senior came over and was like \u201cwtf why are you asking kids to clean this up\u201d and they insisted on calling a professional firm in.", "I've worked in restauration and the fact that she came up and actually told her the child peed is already great to me. I don't know how many times I've had the surprise to see pee or vomit without the culprit (or the parents culprit) telling me. \n\nIn this situation I think cutting her off was the wrong move because she right away went on defense mod, but at the same time if you have some decency you would ask for products to clean up you child's mess. My niece, 3 years old, threw up a little while we were eating breakfast at the hotel and I right away went looking for someone to tell them and I asked them how I could help. They told me it was fine and to not worry but I think I apologized like 5 or 6 times because I felt bad.", "I work food service, and while i am responsible for general cleanliness and spills, i am explicitly *not allowed* to clean any biohazard materials - blood, feces, urine, vomit. Anything that came out of a person, I'm supposed to notify management and janitorial to handle it, for food safety reasons. Now i work in a small food area inside of a larger store (If you've ever seen a McDonald's or subway inside the entrance of a walmart, that's the vibe), so i don't know how standalone restaurants would handle it. But i do know however it's handled, you have to be incredibly careful that the person cleaning it doesn't then contaminate any food being prepared or served.", "When I worked at a drugstore, we weren't supposed to let the customers clean stuff up for liability reasons. People can slip and fall in the mess, cut themselves on broken glass, get spray cleaner in their eyes, etc. I'd think this policy is typical in the US. I know when I've been the customer who made a mess, like when my terrified dog peed on the scale at the vet, I've offered to clean it and been turned down.", "The company should also be worried about having staff not trained to clean biohazards cleaning up human feces *especially if it\u2019s a food prep environment*. Because that\u2019s definitely not liability free, it\u2019s just banking on minimum wage employees being to tired and broke to do anything about it", "The parents chose to use napkins though. OP mentioned blue roll towels, which are kind of like paper towels but much thicker and sturdier, almost cloth-like and are made for cleaning big messes up. I do agree that it was nice of the customer to at least say something, but their actions afterwards (dumping the used ones on the table) is serious AH behavior.", "I'm with you mate. I'm assuming this cafe has a bathroom- but if not, so surely OP has access to a mop? You just need hot water and some disinfectant and then it's a quick job, no bother.", "It sounds like the mum stormed off before OP could provide them with the tools they\u2019d need to clean up - I\u2019m sure had they asked OP would have given them gloves etc. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what they mean when they say \u2018blue roll\u2019 but to me it would be something like [this](https://www.southernhospitality.co.nz/45m-blue-essentials-cloth-roll.html), the rolls of disposable cleaning cloths that are much more absorbent than napkins/paper towels that are designed for cleaning up and disinfecting surfaces?", "A parents needs to clean up bodily waste from their kid.", "I\u2019ve had something similar happen at a previous job but it was worse as it involved poop and blood - the manager cleaned it up herself.\n\nNone of us had proper training or PPE to clean up a biohazard, and I\u2019m not sure but a puddle of urine might come under that umbrella too (body fluid). So unless it was just standard \u201cyour turn to clean the toilet\u201d, it fell outside our scope and of the scope of any insurance should we contract anything.\n\nIt was an employee only toilet, but the dude who came in was known to my boss and absolutely desperate, and she decided to let him use it. So she took on the responsibility of cleaning up.\n\nSo it somewhat hinges on whether it\u2019s 1) within the scope of their job description or 2) whether they have the correct training and PPE.", "There is a massive difference between messes and bodily fluids. Any bodily fluid, urine included, is a biohazard with potentially transmissible viruses/bacteria,  and parents should have the sense/decency to clean it up if their child produced it (every parent I know certainly would). Depending on where the OP is, there are food safety laws which may prevent them from being able to be handling food and beverages after cleaning up bodily fluids.", "Human fluids cleanup is a bit different because it creates a liability on the part of the employer;  if an employee gets a communicable disease from cleaning it up without specific appropriate training the employer can get in a lot of trouble.", "It depends on the business, but in food service specifically, it can also be a sanitary violation for an employee who handles food to also handle biohazards. The risk - however small - of contamination from that employee's hands or clothes (even whrn PPE is used) is often considered unacceptable. I work food service and i am explicitly forbidden from handling biohazard cleanups. Anything involving blood, urine, feces, or vomit requires me to notify maintenance. A smaller cafe with fewer employees may handle things differently, though.", "Sanitary violation? It's their kid, clean after your kid.\n\nAnd yourself for that matter too.", "You are correct the business owner more than likely wouldn\u2019t want the  liability of someone using the cleaning products. If they were to get it on their skin or in their eyes the business would be liable for any medical expenses from the injury", "Where do you live that the general employees of a cafe would have any training regarding that? It's usually a liability to let staff who are not specifically insured and trained for that purpose to clean up a biohazard. (Which is why you never volunteer to be the first aider if you work in a bar)\n\nThere is more of a chance that OP wouldn't have been allowed to clean it up than wouldn't have been allowed to let the customer clean it.", "At the last grocery store I worked in only the janitorial people can clean up bodily fluids.", "it's a sanitary violation to have anyone handling food touch a biohazard. Most places I've worked explicitly do not let anyone who handles food touch a mess like that", "I'd rather clean up turtle crap than human crap....", "I\u2019m really confused about all of these \u201cgross, food service workers don\u2019t have to clean up bodily fluids and it\u2019s dangerous to do so and you don\u2019t have PPE\u201d etc. When I worked in fast food we routinely had to clean messes in the bathroom. It\u2019s not like it was an option to just leave something that was discovered by an employee or a customer reported. You do what you need to do to clean it up. That\u2019s part of the job. Is it gross? Hell yes it\u2019s gross. Call it the 5,432nd thing that sucks about working at a fast food place. \n\nIt\u2019s really nice for a customer to actually fess up to them/their kid being the mess-maker. It\u2019s even nicer for the customer to offer to clean it up themselves (especially if it\u2019s puke, say, and you\u2019re there alone with your obviously suddenly sick kid and you need to try to attend to the sick kid). But ultimately it\u2019s part of your job when you work at a place like that\u2014at least, it was always part of mine.", "Completely disagree lol. Not every employee is properly trained to clean up human waste (a hazard). Also, if your child has an accident, breaks something, gets sick, etc. You as the parent should be apologizing for the mess (accidents happen) and cleaning it up. When I worked at a pet store, we had stations around the store with paper towels, poop bags, spray, and trash cans for dogs that had accidents. Clean up after yourself, your offspring, or your pets.

Still don't get the physics of that one). I tried to clean it myself, but a staff member shooed me away and cleaned it up. After I got back from cleaning up my kid, I found her and gave her the cash I'd brought for tipping the bartenders, and I still felt bad. Can't imagine just expecting a stranger to clean up my child's bodily fluids.", "My preschool aged son threw up while we were in line at a supermarket. He went from fine to not ok in about a minute, I had not taken my sick kid shopping with me.

She just said \"mama my tummy feels funny\" and I started grabbing for a bag and she puked all over the floor. Out comes the wet wipes and a nappy bag and I started cleaning it up.
