At 27, he should be finding ways to deal with childhood issues in a constructive way.\n\nThere is a fine line between recognizing parental mistakes or even trauma caused by the parents and working on handling the problems that arose from that, and simply blaming parents for the way his life was, is, and is going to be. Especially since he doesn't seem to be taking initiative to stop financially depending on his parents -- seems more like a crutch at this point.\n\nAs for invalidating his feelings - eh it's a tough one. You definitely were doing that, but feelings aren't the same as facts. Were your parents' love and warmth conditioned on how well you guys did in school? Was he provided with the same level of support as you were? Have your parents made honest attempts to figure out different ways to help him establish and achieve his goals when he was younger?\n\nSome parents do tend to compare siblings that are close in age. While that is the wrong approach, I wouldn't necessarily classify it as having a golden child. Oftentimes, it's a misplaced frustration because they realize they're doing something wrong, but can't figure out what it is.\n\nWhatever the case may be, it sounds like your brother isn't really in a healthy place, and I do hope he takes initiative as well as gets the support he needs to move on and up.", ">I also stopped receiving money from our parents when I finished uni at 22, and he is still being taken care of by them at 27\n\nthis right here is your answer. Your a grown up, living your own life, while your brother is being taken care of like a child. \n\nMaybe you did get more praise, but it is not because you are the golden child. Clearly that is your brother, as he is 5 years past the age you were cut off and still living off your parents. \n\nReassuring his feelings at this point would not make you a good sibling, as it would just validate his life choices, which is something he doesn't need. Doing so would actually make you a bad brother, as you would just be enabling him further. He needs to hear the truth, that he is being lazy, and that he needs to step up. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Assuming your take on the situation is accurate.\n\nSounds like Mike can\u2019t handle that his little sister is actually making a success of her life. I imagine his view is that he should always be ahead of you because you\u2019re younger, maybe also because you\u2019re a woman. He\u2019s not and he\u2019s blaming anyone other than himself.", "You are not going to win this one. He has clearly taken on the role of a victim and wants to blame someone else for his situation, and is clearly not ready to take responsibility. He is a grown ass adult, and behaving like a child. Your parents need to work on him- he probably needs counseling. NTA.", "NAH\n\nSounds like your parents could of supported him more, but also doesn't sound like you felt like a golden child either. Equally, your parents didn't push your brother academically when he wasn't interested, which may not be the best choice, but is fairly logical... NAH.", "NTA- even if your parents 'ruined' him, if he's capable of recognising that he's able to do something about it. \nWhat does he say about you being financially independent at 22? He's still getting funded while doing his never-ending uni course. \n\nTo be honest it sounds to me like a spoilt boy scenario. Girl is naturally expected to buckle down and get on with work/school etc while golden boy gets away with the bad behaviour. \n\nDetach- he's going to blame you for everything that goes wrong in his life forever. \nAt least your parents are proud of you. From what you say he might not have been stupid but he clearly was a lazy child. Truth hurts.", "[deleted]", "ESH. He is of an age where he now needs to stop looking for things to blame and to learn to function as an adult. Everyone comes out of childhood with some habits to unlearn, and 27 is old enough to do this.\n\nThat being said, you may have been the golden child. He has clearly been made to feel less-than while growing up. Just because you don't think you were the golden child doesn't mean it wasn't so. Telling him that his lived truth is wrong isn't going to do anything other than reinforce his opinion.", "YTA\n\nAlthough to be fair the AH here are your parents. As a mother of two kids, when one of them was struggling in school, I made it my responsibility to help him succeed. I helped him with homework. He really struggled with that. I helped him learn how to read because he came back home not having learned anything. And I kept asking myself, why is my kiddo struggling so much? Why is this so hard for him?\n\nIt turns out, he had ADHD the whole time. Lots of kids his age aren't diagnosed because the adults in their lives just yell at them, and call them lazy. So they give up, accept that they're a failure. And they stop trying.\n\nFrom what your brother says, he reached teenagehood with a shattered self-confidence already convinced he couldn't achieve anything. So he skipped school. That's pretty typical.\n\nThe fact you got a tutor when you were already going well, but your brother only got scolded and berated further shows your parents completely failed him.\n\nThat's not to dismiss your hard work. But OP, your brother is hurting and for good reasons.\n\nedit: a lot of people are going to tell you you're right, he should have tried harder, etc. Most people to this day still think a kid under 10 failing at school is a failure and deserves to be called lazy. But I urge you to talk to your brother again and compare notes about his childhood. There are lots of things you were probably oblivious to when you were little. Kids that age can spiral downward fast when they don't get the support they need, even if they don't have any learning disability. And then their behavior gets worse, and they get yelled at more, and pretty soon \"problem child\" is their entire identity. It's soul destroying.", "NTA. He just doesn\u2019t have the same motivation as you. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s your parents fault and he didn\u2019t have the same opportunities as you. Whether he did or not, he still could have taken the initiative and put himself where he wants to be in life. Instead of blaming others and comparing himself to you and where you are in life. You cannot rely on other people getting what you want. If he wants to be successful and he needs to find the motivation to do so.", "NTA.   \nHe is projecting his insecurities and self woe onto his younger sibling. Tell him to talk to your parents and leave you out of the Shakespearan drama.", "YTA, you are totally dismissive of your brother, maybe he need help and never got because he had all the attention. They threw mike away for the \u201cbetter\u201c child.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is 27 years old, he needed a reality check sooner or later, and better to have it from you than the world we live in today.\n\nHis skipping school, his inability to do his homework, his lack of concentration in  studies, his lack of interest in actually finding an internship so he can finish with his Uni is not on you. \n\nFrom your post, it is clear you both were provided equal opportunities. You both were enrolled in schools, you both went to universities and you both had your own paths to walk on.\n\nYou don't get to blame anyone else for your shortcomings. If your parents provided you with a tutor when you needed and asked them for it, your brother could have done the same, only, he didn't want to.\n\nYou both started on the same path, but went along different ones eventually and that is not on you OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because even his theory of even he was under 10, and he thinks his parents failed him then. Could be true that he didn't get enough support from them then, BUT he thinks they shouldn't have helped you at that time, because you were already doing well. Erm, you were 6-8 years old at time, of course you too needed your parents help and support. \n\nRegardless, your brother is 27 now, still being monetarily supported by your oarents, whereas that support for you ended 3 years ago, when you were 22. That's all on him (and your parents fir enabling him), and your hard work is the cause of your independence.", "NTA\n\nHowever, your brother may have heard often enough that he is really sick of it: he should be more like you. Every time he has needed help, my guess is they have lectured him about how you never need help, but he does all the time. You have an education and a job, he does not. They may not use this to praise you, but instead they have most likely used it against your brother ever since you were children.\n\nThis is not your fault, but it is also not your brother's fault that his trajectory in life has not been like yours. You are different people with different abilities. If you have done anything wrong here, it is by not just acknowledging that you probably had different experiences growing up. He does not know what it was like to be you either, though, so it cuts both ways.", "Usually the golden child is the one babies by the parents way past the age that it\u2019s appropriate. That\u2019s him. If he\u2019s sucked at school and put in no effort what are you all supposed to do? There was money for tutors and he didn\u2019t utilize them. I\u2019m sure from the sounds of it your parents offered to him the same resources they did for you?", "YTA.", "NAH.  It's just a conversation.", "NTA", "NTA, it's totally possible that he's right to some extent, but he's 27 now and can't keep using that as an excuse for his laziness. It's time for him to grow up and get his shit together.", "NTA\n\nYour brother, and sorry for the term, sounds like a whiny b\n\nWe all get dealt a hand, whether it's in our own intelligence, physical and mental health or how our families treat us\n\nMaybe he really did go through a lot and now he has to deal with the consequences, but that gives him no leverage to take it out on you, the only potential responsible would be the parents and he should talk to them about it, instead of shutting down and blaming you for his misfortunes\n\nYou could be more empathetic towards his situation if you want and try to support him, but that is no way an obligation or anything like that, the world doesn't revolve around him and you have no duty to take care of him, supporting someone; especially if they're dealing with mental health problems, is a LOT of work \n\nEither way, whether you really was the golden child or not, this doesn't change the fact that you're both adults now and need to deal with your lives, he should start making efforts instead of blaming the world around him and doing nothing", "I disagree that it doesn't matter. It would help to know more about Mike's perspective but this can certainly sabotage someone's life long term:\n\n>Mike said that our parents ruined him when he was still under 10, because instead of guiding and helping him like parents are supposed to, they labeled him as the lazy/stupid child\n\nIt's very hard to shake a strong message that you're lazy and stupid ingrained at a young age.\n\nPlus, Mike's story gives me strong undiagnosed ADHD vibes. Lots of people diagnosed in adulthood have a similar story. Obv I can't diagnose somebody I don't know through a second hand account on reddit, but it's possible. Or some other learning disability that went undiagnosed because everyone assumed Mike just had to try harder his whole life and shook their head in disappointment when the grades didn't go up. If so, then Mike's disability is still in his way, untreated, making his life harder. And it might take a while before he finds out it's something he should see a doctor for.\n\nI hope he goes to a therapist. But these things cost money, and if he's barely scraping by on his parents' money, it's unlikely he has good access to mental health care.", "No, I remember things completely differently. I remember our parents paying so much attention to him, constantly asking when his tests are and wanting to help him prepare, promising him all kind of presents if he raises his grade average a bit. Meanwhile I was just left alone, because I didn't need the attention. Yes, they did tell me good job and showed my report card twice a year to our grandparents, but on a day to day basis, they were absolutely occupied by trying to get Mike to study.", ">Y T A slightly for invalidating his feelings.\n\nYou'd have had a point if \"Mike\" had said \"I was always the scapegoat\" and OP had disagreed, because that would have been a way of denying the way he sees himself. However, I don't think refusing a label someone else has decided to stick on you counts as invalidating their feelings. How OP sees \\*herself\\* within the family dynamic is for her to decide, not for her brother.\n\nFor me, NTA.", "That's beside the point though. The brother might not have been helped and supported enough and resenting his parents for that is understandable, up to a point. However, resenting his sister and sticking a \"golden child\" label on her because she was (in his eyes) supported adequately and is now leading a successful and independent life is crossing the line into stupid and unproductive jealousy. And NO, his childhood trauma is not hers to sort out or sort through, absolutely not. That's a job for a therapist.", ">You cannot rely on other people to get what you want\n\nThis is such a wrong thing to say\n\nNot because it's a wrong concept per se, but because it is an extremely twisted narrative to say \"don't rely on other people to get what you want\" when other people actually relied on others to get what they wanted. \n\n>Wether he dis or not, he still could have taken the initiative and out himself where he wants to be in life\n\nMaybe yes, but in case that he is right that he was neglected as a child, there is still no excuse for that and his feelings of neglect are still valid. Also, initiative and confidence are things that come with an appropriate upbringing. If he was always treated as a black sheep all of his childhood, there's no wonder he doesn't have the tools to revolve his life around now.\n\nI'm saying this as an autistic son who was infantilized all his life by his mother who was leter apparently blindsides by the fact that I can't talk to strangers and have deep issues keeping a job and also got blamed for it", "If he had ADHD that sort of pressure means your can't. Your brain won't allow you to study because it activates fight or flight.", "She said he\u2019s still being taken care of by his parents still at the age of 27\u2026 So in some way he is relying on his parents? At the end of the day only he can change that. I guess I could have worded it differently"]}
