At 27, he should be finding ways to deal with childhood issues in a constructive way.\n\nThere is a fine line between recognizing parental mistakes or even trauma caused by the parents and working on handling the problems that arose from that, and simply blaming parents for the way his life was, is, and is going to be. Especially since he doesn't seem to be taking initiative to stop financially depending on his parents -- seems more like a crutch at this point.\n\nAs for invalidating his feelings - eh it's a tough one. You definitely were doing that, but feelings aren't the same as facts. Were your parents' love and warmth conditioned on how well you guys did in school? Was he provided with the same level of support as you were? Have your parents made honest attempts to figure out different ways to help him establish and achieve his goals when he was younger?\n\nSome parents do tend to compare siblings that are close in age. While that is the wrong approach, I wouldn't necessarily classify it as having a golden child. Oftentimes, it's a misplaced frustration because they realize they're doing something wrong, but can't figure out what it is.\n\nWhatever the case may be, it sounds like your brother isn't really in a healthy place, and I do hope he takes initiative as well as gets the support he needs to move on and up.", ">I also stopped receiving money from our parents when I finished uni at 22, and he is still being taken care of by them at 27\n\nthis right here is your answer. Your a grown up, living your own life, while your brother is being taken care of like a child. \n\nMaybe you did get more praise, but it is not because you are the golden child. Clearly that is your brother, as he is 5 years past the age you were cut off and still living off your parents. \n\nReassuring his feelings at this point would not make you a good sibling, as it would just validate his life choices, which is something he doesn't need. Doing so would actually make you a bad brother, as you would just be enabling him further. He needs to hear the truth, that he is being lazy, and that he needs to step up. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Assuming your take on the situation is accurate.\n\nSounds like Mike can\u2019t handle that his little sister is actually making a success of her life. I imagine his view is that he should always be ahead of you because you\u2019re younger, maybe also because you\u2019re a woman. He\u2019s not and he\u2019s blaming anyone other than himself.", "You are not going to win this one. He has clearly taken on the role of a victim and wants to blame someone else for his situation, and is clearly not ready to take responsibility. He is a grown ass adult, and behaving like a child. Your parents need to work on him- he probably needs counseling. NTA.", "NAH\n\nSounds like your parents could of supported him more, but also doesn't sound like you felt like a golden child either. Equally, your parents didn't push your brother academically when he wasn't interested, which may not be the best choice, but is fairly logical... NAH.", "NTA- even if your parents 'ruined' him, if he's capable of recognising that he's able to do something about it. \nWhat does he say about you being financially independent at 22? He's still getting funded while doing his never-ending uni course. \n\nTo be honest it sounds to me like a spoilt boy scenario. Girl is naturally expected to buckle down and get on with work/school etc while golden boy gets away with the bad behaviour. \n\nDetach- he's going to blame you for everything that goes wrong in his life forever. \nAt least your parents are proud of you. From what you say he might not have been stupid but he clearly was a lazy child. Truth hurts.", "[deleted]", "ESH. He is of an age where he now needs to stop looking for things to blame and to learn to function as an adult. Everyone comes out of childhood with some habits to unlearn, and 27 is old enough to do this.\n\nThat being said, you may have been the golden child. He has clearly been made to feel less-than while growing up. Just because you don't think you were the golden child doesn't mean it wasn't so. Telling him that his lived truth is wrong isn't going to do anything other than reinforce his opinion.", "YTA\n\nAlthough to be fair the AH here are your parents. As a mother of two kids, when one of them was struggling in school, I made it my responsibility to help him succeed. I helped him with homework. He really struggled with that. I helped him learn how to read because he came back home not having learned anything. And I kept asking myself, why is my kiddo struggling so much? Why is this so hard for him?\n\nIt turns out, he had ADHD the whole time. Lots of kids his age aren't diagnosed because the adults in their lives just yell at them, and call them lazy. So they give up, accept that they're a failure. And they stop trying.\n\nFrom what your brother says, he reached teenagehood with a shattered self-confidence already convinced he couldn't achieve anything. So he skipped school. That's pretty typical.\n\nThe fact you got a tutor when you were already going well, but your brother only got scolded and berated further shows your parents completely failed him.\n\nThat's not to dismiss your hard work. But OP, your brother is hurting and for good reasons.\n\nedit: a lot of people are going to tell you you're right, he should have tried harder, etc. Most people to this day still think a kid under 10 failing at school is a failure and deserves to be called lazy. But I urge you to talk to your brother again and compare notes about his childhood. There are lots of things you were probably oblivious to when you were little. Kids that age can spiral downward fast when they don't get the support they need, even if they don't have any learning disability. And then their behavior gets worse, and they get yelled at more, and pretty soon \"problem child\" is their entire identity. It's soul destroying.", "NTA. He just doesn\u2019t have the same motivation as you. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s your parents fault and he didn\u2019t have the same opportunities as you.

You both were enrolled in schools, you both went to universities and you both had your own paths to walk on.\n\nYou don't get to blame anyone else for your shortcomings.

Because even his theory of even he was under 10, and he thinks his parents failed him then. Could be true that he didn't get enough support from them then, BUT he thinks they shouldn't have helped you at that time, because you were already doing well. Erm, you were 6-8 years old at time, of course you too needed your parents help and support. \n\nRegardless, your brother is 27 now, still being monetarily supported by your oarents, whereas that support for you ended 3 years ago, when you were 22. That's all on him (and your parents fir enabling him), and your hard work is the cause of your independence.", "NTA\n\nHowever, your brother may have heard often enough that he is really sick of it: he should be more like you. Every time he has needed help, my guess is they have lectured him about how you never need help, but he does all the time. You have an education and a job, he does not. They may not use this to praise you, but instead they have most likely used it against your brother ever since you were children.\n\nThis is not your fault, but it is also not your brother's fault that his trajectory in life has not been like yours. You are different people with different abilities. If you have done anything wrong here, it is by not just acknowledging that you probably had different experiences growing up. He does not know what it was like to be you either, though, so it cuts both ways.", "Usually the golden child is the one babies by the parents way past the age that it\u2019s appropriate. That\u2019s him. If he\u2019s sucked at school and put in no effort what are you all supposed to do? There was money for tutors and he didn\u2019t utilize them.

Lots of people diagnosed in adulthood have a similar story. Obv I can't diagnose somebody I don't know through a second hand account on reddit, but it's possible. Or some other learning disability that went undiagnosed because everyone assumed Mike just had to try harder his whole life and shook their head in disappointment when the grades didn't go up. If so, then Mike's disability is still in his way, untreated, making his life harder. And it might take a while before he finds out it's something he should see a doctor for.\n\nI hope he goes to a therapist. But these things cost money, and if he's barely scraping by on his parents' money, it's unlikely he has good access to mental health care.", "No, I remember things completely differently. I remember our parents paying so much attention to him, constantly asking when his tests are and wanting to help him prepare, promising him all kind of presents if he raises his grade average a bit.

Yes, they did tell me good job and showed my report card twice a year to our grandparents, but on a day to day basis, they were absolutely occupied by trying to get Mike to study.", ">Y T A slightly for invalidating his feelings.\n\nYou'd have had a point if \"Mike\" had said \"I was always the scapegoat\" and OP had disagreed, because that would have been a way of denying the way he sees himself. However, I don't think refusing a label someone else has decided to stick on you counts as invalidating their feelings. How OP sees \\*herself\\* within the family dynamic is for her to decide, not for her brother.\n\nFor me, NTA.", "That's beside the point though. The brother might not have been helped and supported enough and resenting his parents for that is understandable, up to a point. However, resenting his sister and sticking a \"golden child\" label on her because she was (in his eyes) supported adequately and is now leading a successful and independent life is crossing the line into stupid and unproductive jealousy. And NO, his childhood trauma is not hers to sort out or sort through, absolutely not. That's a job for a therapist.", ">You cannot rely on other people to get what you want\n\nThis is such a wrong thing to say\n\nNot because it's a wrong concept per se, but because it is an extremely twisted narrative to say \"don't rely on other people to get what you want\" when other people actually relied on others to get what they wanted. \n\n>Wether he dis or not, he still could have taken the initiative and out himself where he wants to be in life\n\nMaybe yes, but in case that he is right that he was neglected as a child, there is still no excuse for that and his feelings of neglect are still valid. Also, initiative and confidence are things that come with an appropriate upbringing. If he was always treated as a black sheep all of his childhood, there's no wonder he doesn't have the tools to revolve his life around now.\n\nI'm saying this as an autistic son who was infantilized all his life by his mother who was leter apparently blindsides by the fact that I can't talk to strangers and have deep issues keeping a job and also got blamed for it", "If he had ADHD that sort of pressure means your can't. Your brain won't allow you to study because it activates fight or flight.", "She said he\u2019s still being taken care of by his parents still at the age of 27\u2026 So in some way he is relying on his parents? At the end of the day only he can change that. I guess I could have worded it differently", "NTA and I don't think it's worth arguing. Refusing to discuss this is a reasonable boundary your brother should be able to respect. If he can't look up options like going low contact or grey rocking.\n\nFrankly - even if you are the golden child, it is not your fault and you owe him nothing. The fact you became self reliant means you haven't been trapped in enmeshment with your parents (common for golden children).  If you haven't been a bully and have treated him with respect then you've done nothing wrong. (Which also suggests you aren't a golden child - it indicates a toxicity which raises cruel, enmeshed, dependent adults)\n\n*It is possible that he's right you had unfair advantages and your parents parented you differently*.  Just make peace with the possibility as you aren't really qualified to tell him he's wrong without extensive family therapy and digging into your respective experiences. \n\nThis does not mean your parents are evil or bad people. You owe him nothing. You are entitled to have your own relationship with your parents based on your own experiences with them. \n\nOne thing that can happen is parents make a lot of mistakes with their first and learn and do better with their second.  Second time parents tend to be calmer and more confident.  It is possible that during his formative years, they made a lot of mistakes that ultimately snowballed into his bad behavior - and they chose to double down focusing on you as you were easier. \n\n(This is not a golden child situation, it's a \"human error, people make mistakes, parents are fallible\" situation)\n\nIt is also possible your brother has struggles you didn't - he may have had/still have undiagnosed learning disabilities. This is very common for kids who are dubbed \"lazy\" and don't do their schoolwork.  \n\nWe had to really fight for over a year to get our eldest his first evaluation because we kept getting dismissed, and it was sheer dunb luck that I happened to meet the right person with the right phone number to self refer. So even if he does have a medical condition that went unnoticed - *it does not mean your parents were bad* \n\nIt also could just be that your personality and lifestyle was more compatible with your parents.  Even in families that are healthy and try their best to be inclusive, the black sheep will just feel that they don't fit in the same.  Again doesn't mean they're bad parents, some people are just more and less compatible and all the effort in the world can't hide it \n\nNone of this really matters. You aren't your brother's keeper.  If this post is fairly accurate then you've grown into a responsible, independent adult and you aren't falling into any of the pitfalls associated with the golden child.\n\nThe main reason I'm sharing this is because there's a multitude of reasons for siblings to have vastly different childhood experiences and, should you wish, it may help you feel empathy while also recognizing that it does not need to impact your relationship with your parents. \n\n(Frankly he just sounds like a dick who blames everyone else for his problems though!)", "NTA he plays the victim who isn\u2019t a victim. He is an adult child", "NTA, but your brother doesn't want to face the reality of actions having consequences and is using being a victim as a way to escape the reality of his situation. If it were me I would start limiting interaction, he clearly isn't in a place to deal with reality.", "INFO: does Mike have ADHD?? \n\nRegardless, I\u2019m thinking this is an NAH situation (possibly N-T-A). Based on what you described, it sounds like Mike struggled as a kid, and rather than figure out *why*, your parents labelled him \u201clazy\u201d. No shade to your parents - it sounds like they did the best they could, and that\u2019s really all you can ask of someone. \n\nBut I\u2019m a psychologist (with ADHD myself) and I see this every single day - someone struggles with school, so they\u2019re labelled as lazy or stupid or unmotivated. This causes the person to *believe* those things about themselves. But since that\u2019s a painful belief to have, they\u2019ll often convince themselves that they actually just *don\u2019t care* about school. So it seems like they do poorly because they \u201cchoose to\u201d, but it\u2019s honestly more of a coping mechanism. \n\nThat being said\u2026 Mike is 27 now. He can\u2019t blame all of his problems on his parents anymore. Yes, he might\u2019ve been disadvantaged (we all are in some way). Yes, he might have psychological/emotional trauma from always feeling \u201cless than\u201d. And it\u2019s absolutely okay for him to be upset about that and grieve opportunities he\u2019s lost. But its not okay for him to blame you or anyone else- *he* is the only person who can change the trajectory of his life. Your parents can\u2019t retroactively get him help and it was never your job to make your parents treat you equally. Mike needs therapy to cope with this and he needs to accept that this is his reality, and placing blame won\u2019t change that. \n\nThe only thing you can do here is validate Mike\u2019s experience - tell him it must\u2019ve been really tough feeling like that. Suggest he get assessed for ADHD or other psychological difficulties (I guarantee there\u2019s something - \u201claziness\u201d is almost always caused by physical or psychological issue). If Mike decides *not* to seek help, that\u2019s on him and there\u2019s nothing more you can do. \n\nBut please try to encourage him to get help if you can. I\u2019ve been in Mike\u2019s shoes and it sucks to realize how different your life could be if you\u2019d gotten support instead of criticism. I spent most of my life being criticized by my parents and teachers and didn\u2019t realize I had ADHD until I was 25. Once I found out, my whole life suddenly made way more sense - I wasn\u2019t lazy, I was having difficulty with task initiation. I wasn\u2019t stupid, I just got distracted by my own thoughts during class. I wasn\u2019t selfish, I just have issues with short-term memory. Realizing that was life changing. But unfortunately I still needed a lot of therapy because I had still spent over 2 decades being told a lot of really awful shit (also my parents were straight-up abusive when it came to my ADHD issues, so I had to unpack that). \n\nAnyway, all that to say\u2026 it\u2019s not your fault that Mike is where he is. And he should really stop calling you the \u201cgolden child\u201d - you worked hard to get where you are and it doesn\u2019t feel nice to have your accomplishments diminished.\n\nEdit: spelling", "OP is female, so you mean sister.", "This makes sense honestly. I mean he\u2019s nearly 30, has been in undergrad for 6 years, and still gets money from mom and dad? If anything I\u2019d argue he\u2019s the golden child lol.\n\nHe put his parents through all that grief that op explained, and they STILL send him money.", "This.  I don't think the brother knows what a golden child is, because golden children are also victims of child abuse. And an insidious form of it that creates deep enmeshment and depedence and can be incredibly hard to break free from, often causing them to become abusers themselves.\n\nThat is a *heavy* accusation.\n\nAnd in no way invalidate that a 27 year old is responsible for his own damn life choices.", "That isn't op's fault or problem and doesn't make op the golden child. Golden child is a term referring to a toxic family dynamic and *golden children are abuse victims*.  Op's brother having an undiagnosed disorder does not make op the victim of child abuse.\n\nI agree that I'm seeing \"undiagnosed condition\" flags as well.  Going through our own struggles with getring kids diagnosed, and seeing how much resources have improved in the last 20-30 years, it still doesn't necessarily mean the parents failed. They could have done everything in their power and followed all the guidance they could find and it still wasn't enough.", "Of course, we are both guessing about Mike through a second-hand account, as you've said. I think we just read it differently. \n\nTo me, a 27yo that ostensibly isn't trying to better his life -- pinning everything he's unhappy with to his early childhood -- reads more like a person that isn't *trying* to take control of his life. Outside of extreme cases, a life can hardly be ruined by the age of 10. \n\nThat's why, to me, the \"they labeled me as the lazy/stupid child\" reads more like a cop-out for not doing much about his circumstances as an adult.\n\nI think we do agree that he isn't in a healthy place, and that seeing a professional would probably be the best way to go -- we just don't agree on why that's the best move for him to make. If they're outside of the US, having access to mental health care shouldn't be that much of a problem.\n\nI think that it's a good thing we've come to a place where we're questioning all authority figures -- parents included. However, I feel like we sometimes don't take into account the toxicity that can come from adult children who blame their parents for anything and everything, and have a tendency of blowing things out of proportion.\n\nSomething can *feel* a certain way when we're young. As we grow older, we develop tools that help us put things into perspective. Trauma is a part of you, but you can't let it *become* you. You need to shape it, not the other way around. \n\nThat's not easy to do, I agree (supposing there is a trauma to begin with), but reacting to it 17 years later as if it just happened yesterday? As I said - not a healthy place to be in. \\*and just to stress - I am excluding extreme situations from this conversation since they aren't mentioned in the post.", "From what I read, he didn't resent her, he vented to his sister about their parents and how they treated him. He isn't asking her to sort out his childhood trauma, just to accept that they were treated differently and that had an impact on him.\n\nHer answer to him was basically yes, they were treated differently, because she deserved it by being such a well-behaved successful kid, and even pointed out to him all the things she did better than him (something he's probably been told all his life).

I do not think you were your parents' golden child for all the reasons others have already given, but maybe I can give some insight into your brother's perspective (sorry, kinda long). \n\nI am the mother of fraternal twin boys, both 20 now. You can imagine that they had a very similar upbringing. But when they entered school, it became apparent that S was more gifted in school things. He learned to read a lot faster and got overall better marks, although M wasn't bad, either. Here in Germany, you get sorted into 3 different school systems after grade 4 (grade 6 in some states). Both reached the highest school level. But when the second foreign language (mandatory in that level) was introduced in grade 6, it became clear that M wouldn't be able to cope. During the year, we decided he would go down to the next-lower level school.\n\nI felt that was really unjust because it wasn't like S was working a lot, he just achieved very good grades by being there, listening well and doing his homework, while M would've had to work a lot just to pass in the foreign languages. In the second-level school, he did ok, but still had to have tutoring in some subjects, partly because teenagers don't do well being tutored by their parents...\n\nWhat's different here between my boys and you and your brother is that we were very careful not to praise S very much in front of M. It went so far that sometimes I thought he didn't get enough praise for doing so well (and in later years, he did have to study, too, if maybe not as much as others), so I sometimes told him in private how proud we were of him. Even when M riled me up by not seeing the need to study, I was always careful to not set S as a shiny example, but try to argue from an intrinsic point of view. Because I knew that he was comparing himself to S all the time, anyway, and coming up lacking.\n\nNow, of course I wasn't there in your youth and don't know how your parents handled it, but it sounds like your brother felt bad because of all the praise you got. To him, acting out may have felt like the only possibility to get your parents' attention since the role of the prodigy was already taken and the attention was focused on her. That doesn't mean that he should feel resentful of you since it's not your fault.

My interests were never the same as my brother or parents and while they would throw me in a rock climbing class or a karate class if asked they wouldn't come to the practices or encourage my interest they would just drop me off and go back to the sports they understood better. They even outright laughed and teased me about some of my interests and never asked further on them such as singing or what television shows I liked.

How I was better at school.
