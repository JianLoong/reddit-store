She invited me down for the weekend because I haven't come around in awhile (she lives on a farm and it's not my cup of tea). I brought my 3 kids with me. \n\nNow, I'm a severe insomniac. Doesn't matter how tired I am. I cannot get to bed before midnight most nights and if anything at all wakes me up, I'm up and staying up because I can't fall back to sleep. Most nights I'm lucky to get more than 4 hours of sleep. I won't take sleeping meds due to having an asthmatic young child who needs assistance using an inhaler. \n\nSo, mum gave us the guest room. It has two twin beds and a double. My older kids slept on the twin beds and I had my asthmatic son in bed with me. At some point during the night my mom opens up the door and lets her dogs in to the room to \"check on us\". She said they wouldn't go to bed without scouting the rooms. The first night I ignore it but I didn't get any sleep at all because her dogs kept patrolling the bedroom throughout the night and the sound of their nails on the floor and their whining/sniffing woke me up. The second (and last) night, I locked the door. This was after telling my mom I didn't want her dogs in the bedroom because I'd actually like to get some sleep so I wasn't driving exhausted with my kids. \n\nWell, come 1am I still couldn't fall asleep and I hear my mom try opening the bedroom door while shushing her dogs and saying \"shush, quiet now, you can't wake up sissy\" (she calls these animals my siblings). When she realized the door was locked she was muttering \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" Under her breath and tried a few more times before walking away with her dogs, who were whining. I fall asleep finally. When I get up my mom was pissed. She said her dogs kept her up all night whining and walking to our door because I didn't let them \"check on us\" throughout the night. She said I was very rude, as \"the poor babies don't want to disturb you and you've turned them away from doing their job\". I personally lost no sleep over it (pun intended).

That is absolutely ridiculous to have the dogs come in the room at 1am.  6 DOGS.  Are you effing kidding me?  This may be her routine when no one is there, but she has to accomodate you, not just her dogs.  This is strange behavior imo.    It doesn't sound like mom was even trying to accomodate you.  She was just going about her routine as if you weren't there.  That's the problem.  The routine needs to change when you have guests.  Unless it's a child, then the guest has to adapt to the routine.  But not for dogs.", "She lost my brother 16 years ago and following his death, she surrounded herself with dogs.

If you invite someone to your house, you should make them feel comfortable and having the hounds of the baskervilles running through your bedroom all night isn't going to do that.", "Agreeeeed.\n\nIt\u2019s not how i was raised either"]}
