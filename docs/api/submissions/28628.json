It isn't her wedding and she doesn't get to request a role.", "I'm interested in what country you guys live, because I know weddings and wedding party roles can vary hugely.\n\nMy husband and I got married in July in the UK. I had two bridesmaids, he had two groomsmen and a groomsmaid. We didn't bother with MOH or best man, because we didn't want to pick this person over that person. No one in our wedding party was upset by that. It was **our** wedding. \n\nYour sister is clearly very important in the relationship, but she's not actually in the relationship. This day is supposed to be about you two and your love for each other. \n\nYou and your fiance should maybe discuss MOH and whether that is actually a correct decision. But the white dress and standing at your fiances side during the vows are completely inappropriate demands in my book.\n\nNTA", "At the wedding\u2026Well, here is OP up at the altar. And his bride all dressed in white. And her sister wife, also all dressed in white. That\u2019s what people are gonna see and that\u2019s what people are gonna think-even if only for a moment- even if it\u2019s explained- as they wonder WTF is going on up there.\n\nSister as maid of honor? Sure, of course. But I don\u2019t think sis wearing a white dress-*too* is a good idea at all.

You never wear white to someone else\u2019s wedding. And each part of bridal couple gets to pick their own attendants. She can, if you chooses, stand up with you, but she shouldn\u2019t be insisting on being maid of honor. \n\nI\u2019ve been a matchmaker for several couples. I\u2019ve rarely been invited to the weddings, let alone asked to stand up at one. Your sister needs to get over herself.\n\nNTA", "Both you and your fianc\u00e9 need to agree however I will saying there\u2019s a reason why people don\u2019t wear white other than the bride at the wedding.

That is super weird unless you are from a different culture or something.\n\nINFO on being the MoH: Why are you choosing this position and not your fiancee?  What is your fiancee's opinion on your sister being MoH?  It just seems weird to me that you guys aren't on the same page here one way or the other and it makes me think I'm missing something.", "Nta the request for white dress and standing next to the bride are ridiculous. Maid of honor is more reasonable but still up to you.", "NTA a moh knows better than to wear white or even suggest. If your partner wants her in that role then she can be but not in white.

You're marrying your fianc\u00e9, not your sister.", "That would be a no for me. It sounds like Mia is full of herself. You can\u2019t demand to be the maid of honor just because you feel like you should be. That\u2019s a choice the bride makes. You can honor her in a toast. The white dress thing, absolutely not. Reserved for the bride. She\u2019s the A hole and being a diva.", "NTA Ok the expectation to be MOH automatically is a little audacious but well she helped that relationship bloom so I guess.\n\nThe white dress and so on not that much a little too intrusive and she seems to push herself in the linelight,talk to her what your expectations are at your wedding,so that she steps down a little", "NTA\n\nYour sister being the MOH is okay (if you and your future wife agree on the point, of course) since she played an important role in your meeting and relationship.\n\nHer dressing in white and standing by you during the vows?

Tell her she is a bridesmaid, will wear whatever colour she is told and will not look like she is doing a stage invasion during your vows.", "NTA. BUT. Your sister does sound a bit insane. Your fiancee, on the other hand, is completely okay with it. Why not let them do it and have a peaceful day with as many happy people as possible? I mean, if you're marrying such a sensible woman who is willing to give up a little glory to make your sister happy I would rejoice.", "NTA. \nIf you and your fiance both agree, then give your sister the role of maid of honor! The rest of her request is absolutely ridiculous. \nAcknowledge her in your thank you toast and be done. \nYour wedding is about you and your bride only.", "NTA Your sister wearing a white dress should be out of the question and is very weird. As someone else also planning a wedding it surprises me how many people think they can also just wear white. What is concerning however, is how involved your sister is in your relationship. Disputes should be handled among yourselves and shouldn\u2019t constantly involve your sister, which ultimately is probably why she feels she can just but in and make odd requests. I\u2019d leave the decision up to your fianc\u00e9 and support her in whoever she chooses and leave it at that. I think your sister should be a bridesmaid, and if she needs the extra attention that bad, just let her give a speech at the reception about how she played matchmaker.", "NTA. \n\nShe can be MOH by all accounts, but the white outfit is just off limits. She can be thanked in your speech and everything but she's not the focus of the wedding nor is she calling the shots afaik.", "Wow, NTA! Your sister is trying to make your wedding about her. It is customary for the bride to choose the MOH. You guys don't owe her anything. No one should wear white to a wedding. \n\nI am going to guess she will make a toast and she will make that totally about her and maybe even air her grievance about not being MOH in white. \n\nBe ready for that", "Maybe give her the title match maker", "Uh, NTA. Wtf? \n\nDon't let her do this. Regardless of whether or not she's the reason you met and stayed together, your love and commitment to each other is **the** reason you are getting married. The day needs to be about that, not your sister in her white (what the actual FUCK) dress.", "NTA. Your wife to be gets to make the decision of who her maid of honor is. \n\nBe sure to mention in a speech how your sister helped you two become a couple. \n\nYour sister absolutely **can not** wear white!! Period. Full stop. That is a ridiculous request.", "NTA but your sister needs to get a grip. She wants to wear white? No, I saw her sister will be MOH. Honestly, put your foot down now. She will lord this over you forever otherwise.", "MOH yes. white no. NTA", "NTA. Offer to do a speech where you thank everyone for coming and then do a shoutout to your sister for not only setting you and your fianc\u00e9 up but helping throughout your relationship and thank her in front of everyone. \n\nThen she doesn\u2019t wear the white dress and is a bridesmaid", "Your sister is overstepping boundaries.\n\nShe doesn't need to wear white, and she doesn't need to be a MOH standing with your fianc\u00e9e. She may have her own friend or family, who she wants standing beside her that day. Wearing white should be left to the bride. It's not your sister's day. I think a small gift or thank you card should be enough to satisfy \" giving her recognition.\" She sounds selfish as if the day should revolve around her too because she was the matchmaker.", "NTA. I don't care what your sister did, does or will do. Nothing gives her the right to make decisions within YOUR relationship. She has NO ownership of your marriage. She does not get to name herself MOH, she does not get to dictate anything about your wedding.  Next you'll be telling us that she's expecting you to hand over your first born child as a 'thank you' for all she's done.  Ugh, just put the brakes on her entitlement NOW!!", "My fiancee wanted her sister to be the maid of honor before my sister started agitating for the position", "No one should be demanding a role in the wedding party. It doesn't matter how close someone is to the couple. Leave it for the bride and groom to choose roles and ask those people. Also, no one should be wearing white outside of the bride unless she specifically asks that individual to do so. The sister is definitely overstepping boundaries. She's trying to make it about herself.", "Sister trumps best friend imo, your sister needs to back off. \n\nThe wearing a white dress thing is super uncomfortable, and your feelings on looking like you're marrying your sister are valid and worthy of recognition by fianc\u00e9 and said sister! You need to be clear about why it makes you uncomfortable if you haven't already. Your own preferences about your wedding come before your sisters need to \"dress however she wants\". \n\nIf she wants that level of recognition for being a good friend and sister, she needs to learn some humility. The day is about you and fianc\u00e9, not her.", "So, it's ok to have 2 MOH's.  But absolute no to the white dress. NOT her wedding. It's just weird.", "make your sister the best man", "This.  The MOHs could even have a different shade and style of dress, either same color family as the bridesmads' dresses or complementary.
