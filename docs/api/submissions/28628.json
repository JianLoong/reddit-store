It seems like she has taken away the opportunity for you and your Fiancee to recognise her in a genuine and really heartfelt way in the speeches which in my opinion is the proper forum for such things.", "NTA. Your sister needs a reality check. A wedding is about the two individuals marrying. Sure, she played a role in your relationship but that doesn\u2019t make her as important as either of you. If none of the other bridesmaids are wearing white then she is majorly overstepping with this ask.\n\nAlso, I think you need to level with your fianc\u00e9. You\u2019re going to be her husband, which should in theory make you her number one priority. Given that she should care more about your feelings than anyone else\u2019s in nearly all scenarios, regardless of if she understands or agrees. You two need to present a united front when family or friends try to push boundaries.", "NTA. No, your fiancee has chosen her own sister for MOH  These honorary roles are not up for debate - the couple asks people who can then accept or decline.  Your sis needs to realize that the wedding is about you, not her.  She should stand where the other attendants stand during your vows.", "<<She proposed another idea, that she would be the Maid of Honor >>\n\nDid you mean Bride of Honor, because otherwise, I am not following this.", "Your sister is being really weird with the white dress request. It\u2019s nice that she has supported your relationship, but needing major recognition at your wedding is too much.", "NTA she sounds like she wants to pretend to be the bride or steal attention why else would she want to wear white at someone else's wedding?\n\n\\- It's probably safer to uninvite her entirely as she'll probably try to sabotage the wedding for attention; she sounds self-obsessed", "It was weird enough when she wanted to wear white at your wedding but stand by your bride as she takes her vows? Ummm that part of the ceremony is usually just the couple. The maid of honor is to the side holding the bouquet at that point\u2026\n\nINFO: Is this a cultural norm? (E.g. is this a western style wedding or something different?)", "Uhhhhhhh\u2026.. this is really odd. \n\nNTA. But how old is Mia? Is she having a hard time with relationships? Why does she want to wear white and stand with her brother and his soon to be wife? It\u2019s like she wants to marry you.", "Why not offer her the role of matchmaker and put a sign around her neck so everyone will know how special she is. NTA", "Nta but fyi your fianc\u00e9e saying your sister can dress up however she wants doesn\u2019t convey \u201cfine\u201d to me, especially if she wanted her own sister to be her MOH and somehow your sister is now pushing herself into that role and everybody is taking sides about it. Seems like your fianc\u00e9e might be checking out, not a good way to start a marriage", "Isn\u2019t this the bride\u2019s decision?", "NTA, though is she aware of just how much work goes into MOH and that it is a very exhausting and stressful hellhole for most all? If not, that might help leverage her idea away or to find a better role in everything.", "Weird af", "NTA, yes she is overstepping what you wish for your wedding. She's not ok with just celebrating you getting married, she came charging what she had given you (supposedly from the kindness of her heart). It's weird, self centered, and you are right.", "All of her requests seem OK, with the exception of dressing in white. That's just not cool. If OP and family and Bride are Chinese or Indian or any other ethnicity with different traditional wedding colors or might not be bad. But from my knowledge anyone posting here probably has \"the bride wears white\" in their cultural periferal if not as a close second. Do not let her wear white. Could she maybe get credentials to officiate?", "NTA\nYou can\u2019t ask to be the maid of honor, and wearing white is sooooo cringe. Maybe the dress can be different from the other bridesmaids but it should not be white unless the bride and groom are okay with it.", "NTA. \n\nEven though your sister was technically the one who set you and your fianc\u00e9e up, she does not get the right to decide what she wants to do in the wedding. There are people who have set up couples and were more than happy to have just received an invitation. Even if your fianc\u00e9e wants her as MoH, it is absolutely attention seeking to dress in white if you're not the bride, or if you don't have permission from the bride to wear white. Don't let your sister walk all over you and your fianc\u00e9e. Stand up for what you want.", "I would take away the option completely. NTA, you can just be a regular guest. Any why a white dress, no way! Just because she got y\u2019all together, you gonna have to thank her for the rest of your lives. Don\u2019t let her spoil your wedding", "I matchmade my brother and his wife. I felt blessed they asked my husband and I to do some music for the wedding. I was not a bridesmaid, and never thought to take any shine away from the bride.", "NTA \nNormally, if the bride doesn\u2019t have a sister, the best friend is normally the MOH, so I\u2019m confused as to who IS the MOH or why you\u2019re fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t ask her to be her MOH. Regardless, it\u2019s your wedding and no one is entitled to that role other than who your bride sees fit. Also, the fact she wants to wear white to the wedding and stand next to you when you say your vows is BEYOND weird. Wearing white to the wedding is a #1 no-no, everyone knows that! Being asked to be a bridesmaid is still an honor and I think your sister is over-stepping some boundaries for sure. Sounds like she needs to be humbled\u2026", "NTA, the white dress is particularly weird and inappropriate. \n\nUnrelated, it's a red flag for the relationship that you had a big fight over kids. There shouldn't be any fights about if you're going to have kids because that means you're not on the same page. There's no compromising on the decision of having kids - if you do, one person is going to end up resenting the other.", "OMG, THIS!  On what planet does the MOH wear \\*white\\*?!?  I've been MOH multiple times, and I was always pretty much indistinguishable from the other bridesmaids, not from the bride!", "I love the \u201che wants to wear a white dress\u201d.  That\u2019s going to be so much more the centre of attention than just another woman in a white dress!", "It is up to the bride who her attendants are. Your sister is being very controlling. Wearing white is a big no no. Yes she may have helped you, but you and your bride are the only ones that are in this relationship. If you don't stand firm on your decisions you are going to have problems going forward. The wedding is making your vows to each other. You are not making vows with your sister. She has main character syndrome.", "Have you sister be your \"best man\"", "NTA is there a chance that either of them are already married? She could have both a Maid of Honor and a Matron of Honor, if so. I\u2019ve see that done before. At the end of the day it is really about who she wants. The white dress is a little much. She could also get ordained online and officiate the wedding instead. That would put her in a position that would be very symbolic of being the reason you two are together and getting to be the one to solidify it.", "He gets to pick out his attendants, you get to pick out yours. Him requesting his sister for MoH makes him a bit of an AH IMO.", "NTA because it's weird for someone to basically demand to be in your wedding party. But since she did play a vital role in your relationship and is your sister, would you feel comfortable making her your Best Woman? That way she can still hold a place of honor as basically the MOH for the groom.\n\nEdit: \n\nHow did I miss this?!\n\n>She wants to wear a white dress and stand at my fiancee's side during the vows.\n\nNo, she does not get to be the bride on someone else's wedding day. Tell her that the wedding party wears what they are told and stays in their proper place during the ceremony. If she can't handle that she can either be just a guest or uninvited.", "Does it have to be divided by gender? Can she not be in your wedding party replacing the best man or whatever. I agree the rest is ludicrous though.", "I had two MOH, FWIW - my sister and my best friend. Sounds like sister may not love this arrangement, but in my case it neatly solved any rivalry.", "Nah the matchmaker in Fiddler on the Roof", "inviting the CEO of tinder to my wedding because he helped us get together", "Exactly! Not quite the same scenario but my brother started me in my career by physically placing my resume on the desk of his manager (that tells you how old I am!). I got the job. That was over 2 decades ago. So should I be giving my brother a cut of my paycheck or bonuses because \"without him I wouldn't have this career\"???\n\nI feel like sister is trying to take WAY TOO much credit in their wedding. Stop it now or she will feel she is entitled to weigh in on every decision.", "The only point of the \"no white\" rule is so people know who the bride is. People take it to extremes here and it's sooooo dumb.", "Ngl, when I read the groom's sister wanted to stand up there *in a white dress* I shuddered.", "They may be Brit\u2019s. It is super common in Britain to have all the attendants in white. If you remember Kate and William\u2019s wedding with the sister, who did kind of steal the show with her clingy dress.", "It's still very rude in Britain. The royals go all the very old fashioned ideals, a hundred odd years ago all bridesmaids were in white to ward off evil spirits and bad luck. Nowadays it's very not acceptable unless one is a massive toff.", "I agree the sister is being controlling, but so is OP. It should be his fiancee's decision.", "this was going to be my suggestion as well. This is a very odd request from the sister.", "It is only fair. Who will be paying for his wedding gown? As CEO of Tinder, he needs a gown to reflect his status, but make sure he does not look prettier than you.", "Yeah that would be such a hard line for me too \ud83d\ude2d", "This is the truly unhinged part.  I mean, protesting the bride's choice of MOH is rude AF, but the feelings behind it are not surprising.  Wanting to wear white and share the spotlight as your bff marries your brother is just bonkers!  Poor girl needs therapy.  Lots and lots of therapy.", "I agree that she could stand with either of them in their wedding party, but she shouldn't get to wear white unless the couple agrees to it. It's a basic rule, no white at weddings unless you're the bride, especially for women. Wearing a white dress *or* a white suit as a woman is super gauche.", "Beat me to it. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00", "Maybe they could work that into the ceremony!", "No, bur he is also not my brother.  The person responsible for our relationship couldn't make it.", "Well, yes.  The idea here is they give her permission wear white.   I agree that it's not okay to wear white unless the bride and groom approve it. \n\nA friend of mine had a midwinter wedding, \nand her bridesmaids wore white dresses with blue embroidery.   The flowergirl often wears white; my flowergirl wore a white dress with a wide satin sash in my bridesmaids' color.  My husband wore a white tux.  Pippa Middleton wore a white dress as her sister's MOH when the Prince and Princess if Wales got married.   Anyway, my point is that I think white is fine if it's what the bride and groom want.   (Although I wanted to kick out the annoying girl who wore a white dress to my cousin's wedding.  That was not approved.)", "> I just feel it would be weird to have her dressed up like that\n\nIt sounds like the groom is explicitly *not* okay with that.", "The comment is Germaine to this situation, not every hypothetical possibility in existence. \ud83d\ude44", "My statement was in response to OP saying his fianc\u00e9 wanted her own sister as MOH. Obviously it's whoever the bride wants, and this bride wants her sister, not the 3rd wheeling, white wearing bestie. \n\nI could have been more clear for sure, but it's semantics at this point.", "What?", "It's not semantics I engaged with you I spoke bugs about their misunderstanding of professionals comment.", "Ohhh gotcha, sorry!", "Nta!\n\nOffer her so.ething else, a dinner, a weekend away, jewelry, to show that appreciation.  Don't give her your wedding!!!", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding party. She definitely shouldn\u2019t wear white. Can she be your best person instead of you having a best man?", "The only MOH I've seen that looked good in white was Pipa Middleton and that was a royal wedding", "INFO\n\n> and have the captions on the wedding photos reflect that.\n\nWedding photos have *captions* now?", "Why not have your sister get ordained and perform the ceremony? That way, she can \"officially \" unite the couple she matched? Just a thought.", "This is absolutely insane and I would like you all less if I had to witness this. God I hope this is a silly lol", "As the groom you really should have  no say in any of this. Maid of honor and bridesmaids are picked by the bride. It\u2019s right there in the name BRIDESmaid, lol.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to make your marriage all about her. Your fianc\u00e9 appears to be a saint also", "Why would she need to wear white as a member of the bridal party? If you want her to be in your wedding, you could have her wear a female tux and be on your side of the aisle, but that\u2019s your choice. Your wedding, not your sister\u2019s. NTA.", "She Is. She doesn't want to be MOH she wants to be the Groom. Think about it and examine her behavior. She just wants to get married.", "NTA. Why can't your sister be your best person?", "NTA\n\nI actually think every bit of her request is weird. \n\nIt's rude to ask to be someone's MoH. Aside from a polite mention during a toast, I don't think a matchmaker has a special place in a wedding. Her request to wear white AND stand to the bride is ludicrous; the people getting married are the only people who should wear white to a wedding unless otherwise requested by the couple. I also find it odd that your fiance is on board with this. I love my bestie if 19 years, but even he would tell me that was too far.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a spoiled child. It is not her wedding. She does not get to where white, stand next to the bride, and have HER Wedding at the expense of you. Tell her if she wants to wear white and feel like the most important person at a wedding, to have one of her own.", "Wait a minute... Is this some cultural thing I don't know anything about? Since when does the maid of honor wear a white dress? It's extremely tacky for anybody to wear a white dress at a wedding except the bride! \n\nYour sister is way overstepping and honestly what she's doing could end up ruining your relationship! She wants to stand next to you and look like you're marrying her... I don't know why, but you will never live this down with your friends and probably all your relatives and everybody there! It's going to be weird and obvious! They're going to think she's got a thing for you. I don't know how else to say that sorry.\n\nYou're NTA but you and your fiance need to put your foot down collectively, and tell her it's bridesmaid or nothing at all and there will be no white dresses or anybody standing next to the two of you at the altar. They'll be with the rest of the bridesmaids like they're supposed to! What's next she's going to want to be at the birth of your child instead of you because if there was no hair there would be no baby? Is she going to insist on having a bedroom in your first house because if there wasn't her there would be no house? Stop this now!", "Unless there\u2019s cultural context I\u2019m unaware of\u2026the MOH does not also wear white. That\u2019s weird.

Regardless of her role, it\u2019s not her wedding. They\u2019re being ridiculous.", "NTA first off, why is your sister trying to push her way into a bigger role? it\u2019s 100% brides decision on who she wants in which role, not the people she\u2019s asking. second, the white dress thing is weird. simple as that. you should ask her if she wants to get confused for the bride at her brothers wedding the whole night lol", "NTA and I'm sorry, but you have NO say in who the maid of honor is. The bride chooses her maid of honor.", "Info : what makes people think they have a say in your wedding organisation ?", "NTA. I\u2019ve introduced couples who ended up getting married. I\u2019ve never once felt I needed to be part of their wedding ceremony in some kind of featured role.

To make her feel good.", "NTA. Your sister seems to have no idea that the wedding isn\u2019t supposed to be about her and she isn\u2019t supposed to have any say, or that wearing white is a no no.
