You've tried to explain, you've done everything you could with basically no support after those early weekends where she helped out, and she clearly doesn't understand or care enough to change this behavior.

You're a good father.", "NTA", "NTA. You were so exhausted that you could not be woken up, and her response is to berate you? And then pull her parents in?\n\nAbsolutely not.", "NTA... it is time your wife shared parenting duty. She needs to step up.", "NTA she needs to do 50% of the childcare and chores after he worl hours are over. Dude, leave her, you will get alimony.", "NTA.  I think it is time you went back to work.  Your wife does not respect you for being a stay at home dad and it seems to be getting worse. Make sure sue is aware you expect a 50/50 arrangement with your child.", "Sounds like she thinks you're her live in nanny, cook, and housekeeper, not her husband. NTA", "NTA! She doesn\u2019t seem to understand how stressful being the primary parent is, those hours extend well beyond a full time job. Fair enough if you\u2019re starting earlier so she can get ready for work but then when she comes home you should get a break (because you started earlier) and then 50/50. It\u2019s also unreasonable to expect that only you sacrifice your sleep which affects mental and physical health, she needs to get up too.\nI\u2019d leave her with baby for 24 hours and see how she copes on her own. Unless you\u2019ve had that responsibility you can\u2019t understand, it may help her realise just how much you\u2019re really putting in", "She has no respect for him or appreciates what he is doing.", ">if the genders were reversed, most people would be reaming the dad for not helping on the weekends \n\nLiterally every single comment on this post is NTA.", "If the gender roles were reversed hell would be rained down upon him.\n\nUs demanding men contribute equally, not \"babysitting\", works both ways\n\nSAHP work the same hours as a full-time employee, in fact, studies have shown they work MORE. \n\nDad should try asking how mom would feel if the roles were reversed.", "NTA. Just because she provides, doesn't mean she shouldn't also be raising the child you brought into this world together.... She says you \"failed\" your daughter, because you woke up late once?\n\nSounds like she treats you more like a maid or something. Sounds like you also don't get breaks at all anymore.", "NTA. You were up half the night with a teething baby.", "Mmmmmm, you are the CEO of your home. No time off or vacation...probably not even on your birthday and holidays.  You are important and your wife doesn't appreciate it. Will she ever change?", "NTA. I have two young children. I\u2019m on maternity leave right now. I\u2019m not sure what your wife does for a living but I\u2019m looking forward to going back to work bc caring for young children is so exhausting. \n\nMy husband and I currently split child care duties (and will continue to do so even when j go back to work). Sometimes one of us sleeps through one of the kids crying. We don\u2019t get mad at each other, we say hey you must\u2019ve been really tired to sleep through the baby screaming so I let you keep sleeping. \n\nMy husband is also a stay at home dad and I make sure to help with the kids and housework even when I work bc I know how exhausting it is, both physically and emotionally. You really need to talk to your wife about how you\u2019re feeling because you are definitely going to burnout and that\u2019s not good for anybody.", "NTA. Your wife is failing in every aspect and needs a reality check. I\u2019d send her this post, what she\u2019s doing to you is self and not sustainable. It seems she gets constant breaks and does not give a damn you\u2019re drowning. You\u2019re not the failure, mate.", "NTA.", "Op, i salut you and inspire to be wonderful parent like you someday. But remember this\ud83d\udc46. You didn't fail your daughter and its time you give some well deserved notice to your wife about all this", "NTA. Take your baby and go home. Wife shouldn\u2019t be upset since she clearly doesn\u2019t want the baby anyway.", "NTA\nI would look her dead in the eye and the say the fact that you can sit there and watch your partner be completely burned out to the point of exhaustion and your body would physically not wake is appalling. If money is all you care about and you feel gets you out of your responsibility as a parent then pay child support and have a good one. However this is unacceptable and rule 1 keep others especially family out of your relationship and family dynamics. To be upset about handling your own child I would stress that sentence. That is a nasty attitude to have."]}
