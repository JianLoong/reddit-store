I have also been in situations like that as the passenger and I feel guilty making someone wait for me when I don't know my ETA.  If her meeting was from 8-9 and she was still in the meeting 90 minutes later, that's 90 minutes of your time gone. And it sounds like you're only 15 minutes away from her which is NOT that far and not worth waiting over 90 minutes for.", "NTA. The meeting was an hour meeting. She couldn\u2019t help a meeting going on longer, BUT she did know you would be expecting the meeting to be finished at 9 am. I understand not using your phone during a meeting, but she surely could have excused herself and said I have to let my BF( and ride) know I will be longer.", "NTA. I've never been in a meeting where they wouldn't let me jump on the toilet really quick and I could send a text. She could have sent you the text and then called you when the meeting is over and wait for you. In any case, even if she had her hands tied and not been able to send a text she has no right being mad at you for not waiting in your car indefinetly.", "YTA.  You are not the asshole for leaving, especially if you have food that could go bad in the car and that you were not getting a response.  That is all understandable.  You are the asshole for expecting an immediate response from someone who is in a meeting at work and getting attitude when you didn't get it.  Did you ever think that she wasn't in the position to text you back due to work?  IMO, you should have texted her saying that you are running the food home so it doesn't spoil and for her to text you back when she can and you will figure it out from there.", "NTA. Having her Uber is a reasonable solution.", "NTA. Asking you to wait that long without any idea of when she would be leaving is unreasonable on her part.  A 15 minute uber ride is no big deal.", "NTA. \n\nThings change which is understandable but she needed to update you to let you know what was going on. Maybe next time she\u2019ll have the courtesy of considering what\u2019s going on for you.", "YTA. Not for leaving when she didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d be able to go, but for being angry at her for the situation and telling her to Uber instead of just going back to her when she is able to leave. You do know this isn\u2019t her being irresponsible, right?", "NTA. Your SO can learn how to drive and get herself home in future if she doesn\u2019t want to use an Uber service.", "Maybe she couldn\u2019t respond back but why do I lean towards you were ignored??? Even if put on do not disturb, ignored. She did know the time you expected the meeting over. I can\u2019t imagine somebody being denied to let their waiting ride know they are running late. It wouldn\u2019t be improper to let it known a need to tell someone running late. NTA.", "NTA.  She was rude and failed to communicate", "NTA it's unreasonable of her to ask you to sit and wait for all the reasons you said", "Nta", "Nta.  Sheesh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren't a taxi service.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nI agree with you that you shouldn't have to wait over an hour and that you are not a taxi.\n\nBut she's not an AH for being pissed.\n\nI think she should have texted you sooner to go home since she didn't know when it would be over. Or you could have texted her you were going home and to texted you when it's over, 15 minutes is not that long, but I can understand that it could be annoying to do the back and forth 2 times instead of one.\n\nNext time, you both should have better communication.", "Exactly!!! Not just start texting or calling as that would be rude. But let it known a bit of a conflict and need to let OP know she is running late. Anybody who would have an issue with that would be an A hole. Response should be, that is fine to let him know we are running late.", "A voice of reason! As yes, she could have handled it so not one person takes offense.", "She is well aware he is just waiting for her to be done so when the meeting runs late she can just mention to the people there she will just sent a quick text to update him that the meeting runs late. Letting him wait without any info is being TA", "I didn't expect an immediate response hence why I waited 15 minutes between texts to allow her time to find a good moment to excuse herself to update me on when she'd be leaving.", "I wasn't angry at her.  I felt that it was disrespectful to not send me a courtesy text knowing I was waiting in the lot.  I didn't want to wait indefinitely with a phone on low charge and raw, unrefridgerated meat sitting in the back seat without an idea of how much longer I'd be waiting for.", "15 min uber ride really is no big deal to make.\n\nWhile I do agree that she definetly isnt Being irresponsible by not sending texts during a meeting(since it would be unprofessional to start making personal text during a work meeting), BUT her irresponsibility is more about not taking responsibility of her own travels to work and back, instead of using their SO and getting angry for *having to use uber*. I find it weird when People expect their SO's to be their *standby waiting free taxi drivers*.\n\nShe already got a ride to work, she can make her own way back", "Absolutely", "Not every company has that corporate culture. Plus we have no idea if there was even an opportunity to excuse herself.  Given the fact at 10:30 she still didn't have and ETA suggest something unexpected happened.", "Again, in certain meeting situations it isn't that easy and 15 minutes can go by in the blink of an eye.  You were NTA for leaving, but  you are showing immaturity for how you handled the interaction with your girlfriend afterwards.  And maybe invest in a car charger if your cell phone that is almost out of charge at 9 am.  Next time you might need the phone for an emergency.", ">  I tell her that I don't want to wait any longer as a) my phone is about to die, b) I've had a corned beef sitting in the car unrefridgerated for over an hour, and c) I'm not going to be treated like a taxi service waiting indefinitely without a single courtesy text letting me know an updated time-frame.\n\nBut I dunno...I don't think you were wrong to go, but to go from her saying \"I don't know when I'll be ready\" to saying you have to go and also you don't want to be treated like a taxi service...that feels a little bit like escalating unnecessarily. I mean, I'm not sure how the texts went, but it just seems like you got a bit snippy...", "Texting in meetings would be a big deal (in a bad way) at my work. I get being frustrated, but I think your annoyance is misdirected.", "That\u2019s fair enough. I guess it\u2019s an ESH situation then.", "Well if you know that is your company culture, you should plan to arrange for a ride home after being dropped off in the morning. People can just wait around for hours on end because you work for a company that does not care how long a meeting goes.", "NTA. If her meeting had an indefinite end time or as soon as she realized it was going to run longer than 1 hr she should have encouraged you to go on home.", "She's mad but doesn't know when she's going to leave an hour and a half after a meeting should have ended?", "NTA. She can uber or take public transport if that's an option in your area. Either that or she can learn to drive and drive herself to and from work.", "Did she just expect you to wait in the parking lot for 2 hours?\n\nNTA", "Wow, surprised by the nta responses. ESH, but only because you've opened yourself up by asking if you did *anything* wrong. You shouldn't have to wait for her, and she should have let you know what was happening, but there's a lack of empathy here. Is something wrong at work? Is she okay? As it's only a 15 min drive, could you offer to come back later. Unless there's some other underlying issue (ie she does this often, or you need to get to work... I don't understand. Plenty of women avoid travelling alone in Ubers and Taxis (due to bad experiences), so it's potentially not the same for her as it would be for you if the situation was reversed.", "Was it ON the person waiting outside without any information as to whatever could be wrong, to stew there, getting angrier by the minutes? Send a damn measage and avoid the nonsense", "No. I agreed he was right to drive off, and she was wrong not to text. \n\nJust thought there should be slightly more concern for her welfare than the tinned corned beef which had spent 90 minutes out of the fridge. For all OP knew, someone in the office had died, or she was getting sacked. No need to get angry about it. Life happens, go home and eat some corned beef.", "If your company doesn't have that corporate culture, you need to be understanding that people can't indefinitely put their day on hold to wait for you.", "YTA. She is in a work meeting! My boss would have been upset if anyone was on their phone during a meeting. You should have just texted that you were leaving since it seems like the meeting went over the hour.", "NTA but both of you teeter really close to sharing blame.", "Really? Your work would have an issue with someone leaving a meeting for one minute to let their ride know they were running late? Yikes!", "Nta, she\u2019s probably actually mad at who or what caused the meeting to run late. Meetings running over make me very irritable. Not an excuse to take it out on you, but surely this won\u2019t be a big argument once she\u2019s home and chilled", "NTA you gave her the courtesy of letting her know you were leaving when she couldn\u2019t be bothered to update you on her work status. It\u2019s unreasonable to except someone to wait upwards of two hours for you without updating them on what is going on.", "> but why do I lean towards you were ignored??? \n\nBecause she only responded when he said he was leaving and she only responded to tell him not to leave.", "NTA.  If she wasn\u2019t 100% sure of an end time, then she should have said not to wait.  I get it can be impossible in some meetings to text.  But at some point she should have said go home.", "NTA, if she truly thinks you should be forced to sit and wait, even though she doesn't even have the consideration to update you, man you need to think about how she treats you normally. That's self centered and rude ass behavior on her part!", "NTA and your girlfriend does not respect your time.  Maybe think about her becoming the ex-girlfriend.", "NTA", "Sorry you are being down voted. Corporate life is not always rational. It should be but sometimes you might need to focus on keeping your job and being in good standing.", "She's a great girlfriend.  It was a one-time occurrence."]}
