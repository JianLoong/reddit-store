We had a party for him, but some of my wife's family couldn't make it due to scheduling conflicts.  So, we had the rest of her family over for dinner this past Saturday.  It was my wife's parents and her 2 brothers.  One of her brothers, Jake, brought his GF of 6-months.  This was the first time that my wife and I had met his GF.  She seemed very nice and polite and even offered to help with the cleanup after dinner.  She was also funny and charming, I like her and told Jake that I'm happy for him.\n\nAfter dinner, we were sitting around and chatting when my son came up to me to tell me he's ready for bed.  He said he wanted to go to his room and get his \"nuk\" and read stories.  He doesn't use a pacifier during the day, but still sleeps with it.  We're working on getting him to give it up, but he's just not there yet and my wife and I are trying to let him make that decision on his own and not force it yet.  \n\nJake said \"Isn't he a little old to still be using a pacifier?  Seems like something that babies do.\"  My son turned to him and said in his cutest angry toddler voice, \"I'm not a baby.  I just turned 3 and I'm a big boy.\"  That got a laugh out of the adults and my wife and I took our son up to bed.  While we were getting him ready, my wife told me that Jake shouldn't be talking because he sucked his thumb and carried his blankie with him everywhere until he was almost in kindergarten.  \n\nAfter putting our son to bed people were getting ready to leave, but we live in the Midwest so that whole process takes like an hour.  Our son started to fuss during this time so my wife went up to calm him down.  Jake made another comment about our son using his pacifier and I said \"Dude, first off, you don't have kids. And second, didn't you suck your thumb until you were like 5?\"  \n\nHe immediately blushed and got flustered.  MIL and FIL both immediately chimed in with \"Oh, that's right!  And you carried your blanket everywhere!  It was so hard to get you to give it up when you went to school!\"  His GF started making baby cooing noises and said \"Aww, did my little baby need to suck his thumb.\"  Like I said, I like her.  Jake was clearly pissed at being called out and pretty much ushered his GF out the door, barely saying goodbye.  \n\nWhen my wife came back down, she asked where Jake and his GF went and I told her what happened.  She said that when she told me that, she didn't think I would call Jake out like that in front of his new GF and I clearly embarrassed him to make a point.  But even my wife's parents thought it was funny and joined in.  Like, dude, don't dish it out if you can't take it.  \n\nMy wife thinks I should apologize to Jake and his GF for embarrassing him like that.  Which I'm ok with, but I kind of want him to apologize for insinuating that we don't know how to raise our son when he doesn't have kids.", "created_utc": 1667860306, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp2x8c/aita_for_making_my_bil_look_bad_in_front_of_his/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get teased because I always had a new one in a drawer or the baby bag in case the one the kid was using got lost or fell out somewhere and it was not in an easily accessible place (under the bed at night or wedged behind the baby bed and required furniture to be moved). Nobody has ever had a completely perfect childhood. Someone has always gotten peed on, put the diaper on backwards, or had an escape artist.", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think you owe him an apology.
