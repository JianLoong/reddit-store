My husband and I were excited to try it out. We'd ordered take-out three separate times over the course of two weeks (both sets of in-laws ate the pizza we ordered on at least one occasion). Each time, there were issues with our orders, the last being the most egregious: One wrong pizza noticed by my husband when the order was picked up (he was made to pay for a new pizza), another wrong pizza noticed when he got home, and forgotten garlic knots. I called the restaurant and told them about our situation, including the other two orders we'd had issues with previously. (For our 1st order, rather than posting on SM or giving them a bad review online, I called the store to make them aware they had left a topping off of our pizza, which we had paid an extra $6 for. I was told we could get a free pizza the next time we ordered, which we didn't do since we weren't looking for anything in return). The manager told me that whoever promised a free pizza was lying because they don't give out free pizzas. As to our 2nd order issue (they ran out of ingredients), she told me they can't be expected to have ingredients on-hand at all times and aren't able to send employees to the store to purchase them while the restaurant is open. As to that night's order issues, she told me the order for the 1st pizza they received was what they made (not possible, as it had meat and we're vegetarian). I told her I could let that go (since my husband already paid for the new pizza), but needed her to do something about the other incorrect pizza and forgotten garlic knots. She reluctantly agreed to comp a corrected pizza and to send garlic knots with it. I did appreciate that, but her attitude was extremely off-putting. I did ask to speak with the manager but was told he was unavailable.\n\nI decided to share this experience on my local community's Facebook group (even saying the actual pizza was delicious). I wanted to alert others to check their orders before leaving the restaurant (which one should do anyway, but many don't). I wouldn't have done so if the business had handled the situation differently. I received some hate, saying I shouldn't write negatively about a local business because local businesses are hurting. \n\nAITA for sharing my experience with my local Facebook group?", "created_utc": 1674056079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fa8yy/aita_for_sharing_my_experience_about_a_local/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What freakin pizza joint charges $6 for a single ingredient? Is the pizza 30\u201d wide?!\n\nHere\u2019s my tip: learn how to make quality pizza inside your own home. A pizza steel can be had for $40-60 and will help with your overall baking needs for cookies and other baked goods, and dough is easy to make well with just a few ingredients. Pizza sauce is cheap and the toppings are endless. \n\nA quality home made pizza is $7-10 worth of ingredients and maybe an hour if your time, most of which is just waiting for the dough to rise or to bake. Alternatively you can just make it in a well seasoned cast iron pan which is $15 if you don\u2019t want to buy a pizza steel. \n\nYou can check out Brian Lagerstrom or Kenji Lopez-Alt for some great pizza or pizza dough recipes. \n\nMOST pizza places out there are trash, another handful are amazing but they screw the customers, and some others are amazing and deliver on quality and don\u2019t charge $30 for a pizza. \n\nStop overpaying for stuff you can easily make at home to your liking from a business that is there to make money and not serve its customers with a product that is worth it.", "NTA.\n\nThey're more than earned their bad review.\n\nI'm a little puzzled though while you keep going back to the pizza joint where you've had bad experiences... again and again and again", "NTA.", ">The biggest local FB reviews page around me specifically only allows positive posts, all negative experiences are taken down and its such a weird thing\n\nI think the local page here does the same. I kinda get it, though. These businesses are not easy to keep running and one bad review, even if inaccurate, can really impact a growing business. It is probably easier for admins/moderators to simply ban all negative testimonials rather than try to screen for the truth. There are enough bad reviews on yelp/Google.", "We have a local group like this as well and I don't think its a weird thing at all, but it depends on how the group is positioned.\n\nMy group called \"Our Town Menu\" specifically notes they aren't actually a reviews page. They're a page to promote local business. Which yes, often means people sharing positive experiences at local businesses, and sometimes means the businesses themselves sharing things as well.\n\nThere are a million places to simply share reviews. Google, Yelp, Tripadvisor, plenty of options out there. These groups generally don't want to simply be another one of those, they want to be an option to promote small businesses that have struggled mightily in the last few years. They advise that you are free to go to those places and leave negative reviews, but these pages really are about promotion. They can still be highly useful as long as you keep that in mind.", "Or at the minimum put a disclaimer out saying you are having supply chain issues, and call the customer as soon as you receive the order to try to accommodate them!!", "Yes! As long as it's honest and not just straight up bashing, negative experiences should be equally accepted, IMO.", "They also required them to buy a new pizza to replace one that was made wrong which absolutely makes them the AHs.\n\nThe restaurant's behavior is absolutely unacceptable, even if brand new.", "> I have a problem\n\nshould have just stopped right here", ">they can't be expected to have ingredients on-hand at all times\n\nWow - every time I've ordered other food, they tell you when you order what they don't have, so you can change your order.", "Go post it on Yelp or Google or something where it can't be so easily removed", "This would also be good customer service.\n\nMaking the order without the ingredient and expecting the customer to still be happy is not good customer service.", ">  As to our 2nd order issue (they ran out of ingredients), she told me they can't be expected to have ingredients on-hand at all times and aren't able to send employees to the store to purchase them while the restaurant is open.\n\nAnd they don't get to charge you for the missing ingredients!", "Sorry I forgot this was the agree with the masses post.", "That part you quoted is one of the reasons why I chose NTA. Every food business I have been to (not all business are equal though\u2026as made clear by OP\u2019s experience) tell me when they are out of certain ingredients. So that part of the story really popped out at me.", "Yeah, because they're weighted algorithmically in a way I trust more. Yelp basically takes restaurants hostage - if restaurants don't pay them monthly, then they push bad reviews to the top of the algorithm. It's super messed up.", "My local FB group also only allows positive reviews, so it didn't let me post about a bad experience I had with a company.\n\nI did post a negative review on Google. However I recently noticed that they had a slew of 5 star reviews, all posted in the same month. Before that, they had one review every couple of months.\n\nNot sure how much I trust Google reviews after that. After all, they're the reason I hired that company in the first place.", "So when an order is wrong, is it the restaurant's fault for giving out the wrong order or OP's fault for not checking?", "NTA honesty like this is nice when a new place opens up and it's the only reason I belong to any of my local facebook groups. We had a pizza place that was similar, the food was great but the inconsistency of delivery, what you would get, I think the owners kids answer the phone and didn't pay attention. If pizzas were still $10 for an extra large, that would be one thing. Shit's expensive now, I want what I paid for.", "NTA", "You're NTA, but I'm not surprised about the backlash from your local FB community group. That's a pretty standard reaction people have to those posts for some reason, no matter how justified.\n\nAlso I would just not continue to order from them because that all sounds like incredibly bad service, even IF the pizzas are delicious. It's really odd to me that they wouldn't tell you if they were out of stock on an ingredient, and would intentionally charge you for it knowing they wouldn't be providing it. I don't know where you are, but $6/topping is an unbelievable amount. Also it's really poor customer service to pass the cost of their mistake onto you by forcing you to pay for your own replacement. That coupled with a bad attitude is the perfect recipe for a new business to go under. There's no way it's only happening to you, most customers don't complain - they just don't come back.", "I have a similar local FB page!!!! Everyone raved about one Chinese place so we tried it and it was not good at all but we couldn\u2019t say anything about our experience. Like what\u2019s the point of discussing this stuff if we can only talk about the good and not the bad???", "On the face of it it seems weird yes, but being a member of a few small town FB groups the problem comes when people start arguing about the review, whether it was right to criticise a small business, why aren't group admins intervening, why are group admins intervening, etc etc. It's a tough job to moderate so I can understand why some groups would allow positive comments only. Much simpler to run a group with that rule. And no need to try to work out what's fair comment and what are personal attacks, grudge driven posts, bullying, attempts to damage business competitors, etc. Small town people are frickin bored, I tell ya. Too much time to make trouble on social media.", "That\u2019s bad but I think not replacing the wrong pie and making him PAY for a new pizza is the worst.\n\nI don\u2019t care how good they are, I wouldn\u2019t go back for AT LEAST 6 months.  And then only if it looks like they got their shit together.", "the server was also absolutely lying about this. i used to work at domino\u2019s, and there were plenty of times that we ran out of ingredients during the lunch or dinner rush. we didn\u2019t just sit back and say \u201cwell sucks to be you\u201d to the customers. the managers would just tell someone to go to walmart and buy whatever ingredient we needed (they were given company money to buy the ingredients of course).", "Went back 2x. Dude, was really tasty pizza. Unfortunate.", "I\u2019d just post it to their google reviews, it won\u2019t get removed there and more people will see it anyway.", "They do that for all businesses.
