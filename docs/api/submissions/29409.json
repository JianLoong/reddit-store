Everything they said literally goes against those ideologies.\n\nKindly educating people who have displayed no ill intent will go a lot further than throwing buzzwords at them.", "Why use their term TERF? Gets thrown around a lot, what makes you think they're a radical feminist?", "Ok.  How young is too young?", "That's a really important point.", "As a bi person I feel that lmao \n\nPeoples hang ups on sexuality and gender are fucking wild.", "I tend to think that this is because we, generally, are still really new to expressing and understanding gender the way we do, and we're still kinda figuring it out. Sometimes we get it wrong, but overall I think we're handling it fairly well, and getting better all the time.", "Not entirely sure who I should respond to first, but I'll say from my view, it's not about the binary and more about the let's say masculine feminine and the other category that doesn't fit within masculine or feminine gender norms. When I think of this third category I can totally understand something of a blue green red triangle sort of idea as there may be degrees of masculine feminine and non gendered feelings of gender, but if we were to say you transition into an agender type of gender, what does that even mean for you? It sounds more like you don't really have a strong sense of gender or attachment to gender in that case, so what makes someone on this side of the triangle have a strong inclination to identify with? I feel like it has to do with finding yourself as what people might explore with themselves when presented with opportunities for self exploration after having problems identifying with what binary already exists. I don't have any problems with doing this, but I am hesitant to grant a category of gender identity that doesn't seem to share at least as far as I know, a case of gender dysphoria similar to MTF or MTF trans people. I've had this conversation many times and gone back and forth on this, but as long as there is no dysphoria to notice in children, I don't see it", "I don't want to go too personal, but I can tell that I experience gender dysphoria as a nonbinary person, and it can be rapid at times. I don't feel comfortable presenting my biological gender, but I feel uncomfortable about the \"opposite\" gender too. It leaves me with this floating empty feeling that I'm nothing and I'll never be accepted as a person with no gender. I often wish that I didn't have a physical appearance because it's impossible to look nonbinary. People will always misgender me but it's the harsh reality.", "Before they start talking.\n\nBecause you realize they have minds and ask stuff, right? A 3 year old can ask, \"Mommy, why do you wear a diaper once a month?\" And then in an age appropriate manner, you explain, \"Mommy's body practices to make a baby every month, so when Mommy isn't going to have a baby, Mommy's vagina bleeds.\"\n\nYou keep talking about that as the child gets older, and the 8 year old is going to be like, \"Wait, how DOES Mom's body makes a baby?\"\n\nAnd then you explain THAT in an age appropriate manner. And then that 8 year old is not an idiot, so when you explain sex, eventually they're going to wonder why people don't make a baby every time they have sex. And then eventually they're going to ask why, and you explain, in an age appropriate manner, that people use medicines or other things like condoms to stop them from having babies.\n\nThen you keep having that talk for the rest of their lives until they start screaming and running from the room with their fingers in their ears.\n\nSex education is an on-going process that starts as young as possible."]}
