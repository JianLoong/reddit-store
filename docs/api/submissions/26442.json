But yeah he is an AH for saying his younger kids birthday party is more important than fulfilling his legal obligations to a child he abandoned. His family sucks too. Though it's kind of ironically funny that they're mad you blocked him, but not mad at him for abandoning you and not fulfilling his financial obligations. He got himself in this situation by not paying what he owed before. He sounds selfish and uncaring. It's probably better that you blocked him since he's so cruel. He's only hurting himself now by refusing to pay what the court ordered.

I worked with a man that was unable to function from the chest down. He worked reception and also did audio recordings. He had a handful of medications to take every lunch and showed me a better ways to use the computer systems when I started.\n\nBut the thing is, he said his parents didn't support him after 18. Legally he could pursue them, but it wasn't worth chasing his father for every nickel and dime. He was depressed but found his niche and it helped his mental state tremendously letting the cord be cut.\n\nI want OP to succeed, not depend on the income of someone who doesn't give a pile of dung about them.
