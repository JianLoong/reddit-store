My sister brought her husband (38M) and two kids, and I brought my boyfriend (24M). I thought it would be okay, since my mom adores him and vice versa. I even asked my mom if I could bring him, and she was fine with it.\n\nHowever, last night after everyone else went to bed, I was hanging out on the porch shooting the shit with my BIL. We were just chatting, but after a while he mentioned how he thought it was \"inappropriate\" that I brought my boyfriend along. I asked why he thought that, and he said it made him \"uncomfortable\" to have a non-family member at a family visit.\n\nFor context, I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years; he's not a random fling. I told my BIL that I didn't think it was a big deal, and that as long as I wasn't fucking him on the kitchen table during family dinners there wasn't any reason for him not to be there. BIL got pretty pissed at that, and to be honest I feel like I may have gone out of line. He said again that I shouldn't have brought my boyfriend, then got up and went inside.\n\nI feel pretty shitty. I know this isn't about him being a non-family member; it's about him being, well, a him. I understand that a lot of people have issues with gay couples, and I don't want to cause issues or have my BIL think that I'm forcing my relationship into his face. Also, I feel like that table-fucking comment may have been pretty unhinged.\n\nI just don't know what to do; for one, I don't want to cause unnecessary strain on my relationship with my BIL, but at the same time, I want my boyfriend to be comfortable and I don't want to get him involved in anything or make him feel bad for being here. I think I could have avoided this whole thing by just leaving him at home.\n\nSo, AITA for bringing my boyfriend along on a family visit?\n\nEdit: Okay, I'm a stupid bitch for not including this, but no, this isn't the first thing he's said about me being gay. I've been getting some shit for the table comment, in part because my awful writing skills made it sound like I immediately escalated the situation without any prior conflict/issues. That's not the case. I just want to clear some things up so I don't have to do it in the comments.\n\n* BIL has made several (okay, *many*) homophobic comments about me/my bf over the past couple years. Some of them were behind my back and later relayed to me by other family members, some of them were directly to me, but the point is, this isn't a one-off. I don't want to justify my obviously rude comment, but this is kind of an ongoing thing. \n* No, he isn't speaking for someone else. He himself is upset about my boyfriend being here, and he's the only one (as far as I know) that's uncomfortable. This post is about him and him alone.\n* I don't know if it was totally clear, because at least one person has seemed to have gotten this mixed up, but that comment was just to him. Nobody else was there. I might be rude as fuck, but I'm not crude enough to say that in front of everyone else. \n\nI hope this clears things up a little more. I should have been more upfront from the beginning.

That table-fucking comment was hilarious and may have been a little out of pocket, but you  definitely aren\u2019t responsible for your bil being uncomfortable with your relationship. And you\u2019re not \u201cforcing\u201d your relationship in his face. It doesn\u2019t even matter how long you and your bf have been together, if you care abt him enough to want to include him family trips then you have that right, and so long as he isn\u2019t an asshole ruining everyone\u2019s time (which he clearly isn\u2019t) and y\u2019all aren\u2019t actually fucking on the tables LOL then there\u2019s no problem.

If he's made a habit of making comments around you, then he might have deserved it!  Based only on this conversation though, it seemed like a drastic escalation.\n\nHowever, he had no right to comment on who you bring home with you in the first place.  After 3yrs your partner is probably in the \"practically family\" group anyway...unless you only just started bringing him around.  But even if this was your first time bringing him, you checked with your Mom first and her opinion was the only one that mattered since she was the one you were going to visit.\n\nTell BIL to keep his comments to himself and tell your sister that her husband needs to learn to respect your partner or he can be the one to stay home from family gatherings.", "NTA, and as for the comment?  You\u2019re adults, he\u2019ll live.  It\u2019s honest, maybe a bit crude, but you were right.", "NTA - It's your Mom's house, she loves your BF and said yes to him coming.

Are you supposed to un-gay yourself around him?

Fuck the homophobic boyfriend. His opinion is not valuable.", "NTA like it or not after 3 years he\u2019s family. BILs homophobia doesn\u2019t need to be accommodated.

If I was in your place, I'd have asked what exactly made him uncomfortable, because your mom and sisters had no problem\n2. Also, you are dating him for 3 years, that makes him a family member I all aspects but paper. Is he saying he needs a written certificate for comfort?\n3. Lastly, ask him if he never visited your sister at her house when they were dating. I'm guessing your sister didn't have an arranged marriage. So did he never cone to your sisters house at that time because he was \"not a family member\"?\n\nTrust me, he is a homophobic bigot, and this is his way of trying to coax you back in the closet", "Nta, you need to talk to your sister. It\u2019s terrible that she is allowing her husband to treat you and your bf this way. Him making comments to family members.

Does he do this around your family often? How does your sister react?\n\nOP, your wording was meant to shock and it did. I'm sure BIL is filled with images he might not have wanted to visualize.

It\u2019s hardly a shocking reality for a dude with 2 kids. Maybe it\u2019s a little uncouth, but it\u2019s absolutely within your right to snap back at him when he\u2019s expressing personal biased distaste for your partner based on your sexuality in your family\u2019s home. Your sister chose to bring him, you chose to bring your partner, it\u2019s equal. Having a ring or a piece of paper is just a legal procedure. Your partner is your partner. They may not be your forever partner, but hell, your BIL might get divorced from your sister. Being legally married doesn\u2019t give him some sort of privilege over your union and entitlement to your family. \n\nYou are definitely NTA and for the rest of your time around him you should dial up the amount of PDA with your partner and make deliberate unblinking eye contact with BIL each time. Just unnerve the fuck out of him.", "First of all talk in private about the issue with your sister and ask if her is uncomfortable with your bf, and tell what BIL said to you and make sure to imply the bigotry in his comments.

Hers is the opinion that counts. I would go LC with BIL if I were you. That kind of unhinged disdain is now and has always been illogical.

I probably wouldn\u2019t have made the fucking on the table comment, I\u2019m a bigger AH than that, I would have apologized for his obvious jealousy but seeing as he\u2019s married to your sister he\u2019s going to have to bury his feelings for you as you love her too much to hurt her.", "NTA and fwiw i really don\u2019t think the table comment was that big a deal - you were behaving perfectly appropriately before that and he was still uncomfortable, so he\u2019s obviously just uncomfortable in general because he\u2019s a homophobe and I doubt one joke is going to make a difference. I\u2019m a lesbian and in my experience, no matter how \u201cwell behaved\u201d you are around homophobes, some of em are just gonna be assholes about it no matter what. \nI\u2019d focus on making sure you and your bf are as happy and comfortable as possible, and that your mom is having a nice time too :) it\u2019s great that her and your bf get along so well.", "NTA for the actual topic of the post itself - \"AITA for bringing my boyfriend along on a family visit?\"\n\nThe table comment, however, was actually inappropiate at a family gathering though and to say to an in-law, I'm also gay and that's not a gay/straight/homophobia thing, that was just actually very rude.\n\nHis homophobia is obivously much worse than your off-the-cuff rude comment though, so don't apologize, and uh he can go to hell lol.", "NTA for bringing him, but you should have reacted calmly to his statement and said that it was approved by your mother.
