The seating arrangement was on first come first serve basis in the ground. We reached around 6 pm. I got down from the car to look for seat with our second child while hubby parked the car. I saw that the first few rows were reserved for children participating in the function and the rest, about 20 rows were for their families. I could only only see single empty chairs and none in pairs of threes in the front. We needed atleast two chairs together.  So I went and sat where there were ample empty chairs though it was in the last few rows. By this time hubby came, i waved at him to show where we were. He made a hand motion of going to the front. I assumed he meant he was going to look for empty chairs. I nodded thinking maybe he will find some. I got busy with my second child in settling her down. When I looked up I couldnt see him. I stood up to see where he was and found sitting on one of the empty chairs that i had already seen earlier but didn't go to because we came as a family. \nI was furious to see his selfishness. I asked him how he wud have felt if I had been in his place and sat down anywhere without thinking about where he wud sit. He was like yeah yeah whatever but doesn't think it was a big deal. \n\nSo, AITA for expecting him to sit with his wife and child at a function to see our older child participate?\n\nEdit: we were late because he had a teams meeting to attend which ended around 5.30pm. then he got ready to leave", "created_utc": 1680177321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126kqz6/aita_for_expecting_hubby_to_sit_with_his_family/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only did he take a better seat, he left you alone with the younger child to take care of on your own. Incredibly selfish.", "NTA you went together and this means you would sit together. Not doing so is rude. He should have communicated better if he wanted to sit alone.\n\nAlso, the function is something you have to celebrate as a couple (you are raising that child) so it's even worse to deny you sitting together.", "Next time you have performance to go to don\u2019t wait on your husband. Since he made you late and he decided to sit alone and act like you didn\u2019t come as a family - I would drive myself next time s d get myself a good seat.  That would make me mad if my husband waltzed in and sat toward the front and left me to sit with our other child in the back because he held us up and made us late.", "NTA, families sit together", "NTA. Hubby is really terrible here. He's supposed to be your *partner*, for crying out loud! What if you had needed to use the restroom but youger child didn't want to miss the function? You're not going to leave a child unattended even in a setting where you likely know multiple other parents there. That's part of the reason why children need both parents growing up--each parent has to step in and watch the kids when the other is busy. It's actually part of the job of parenting.", "NTA - It is to be expected.\n\nNow, if he traded off with you periodically so you could also get closer, and he stayed back with the other child, this would also have been acceptable", "NTA. I would have taken this for granted as well.", "NAH\n\nAs a teacher, I have done countless school functions like this, always in overcrowded gyms where there is never enough seating for the number of families, and it is not uncommon to see families sitting separately? Dad might be sitting down closer or on the side to film, while everyone else is up in the bleachers. Or one parent might have gotten their late from work and might be standing on the opposite side of the room so as not to disturb a performance in progress. \n\nIn your case, you got there late and seating was quickly filling up. It sounds like you two got separated and there was a miscommunication. I would have wanted my husband to sit with me, too, but maybe his goal was for one parent to get in close so they could film the performance (which your older child might have wanted.) He also might have thought with how late you got there, maybe there wouldn't be enough seats for everyone anyway. I probably wouldn't let this derail my day.", "Nta", "NAH I am going against the grain here saying this, but it seems like their was just a misunderstanding on both parts. Too often people here areas a few paragraphs and make the decision that someone is terrible partner, person etc. It seems to me he signaled to the front to say hey is it cool if I sit up there? You nodded he took that as you saying it's ok.\n\nFrom your perspective you thought he was signaling to say he was going to check closer and you nodded ok.", "NTA- your husband sounds awful.", "NTA, but he absolutely is. Yikes", "Info - did he take photos and videos that wouldn\u2019t have been captured from the back?\n\nLeaning towards NAH as it\u2019s not that huge of a deal imo", "[deleted]", "YTA. He chose to sit up front to watch his child perform. The world did not end because he didnt sit beside you for the 1-2 hour event celebrating his child. I think this is much a do about nothing", "YTA - you were \"furious\"???? Maybe irritated, but furious is ridiculous. Who the fuck cares? He wanted a better view, which isn't selfish at all!", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nYou gave him permission.\n\nI get your initial reaction to be upset, but you clearly gave him a signal that moving forward was okay.\n\nWas there a miscommunication? Sure. And that's exactly why instead of being furious you should have given him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAnd in the greater scheme of things, you have a husband who desperately wanted a better view of his daughter. I find that sweet, not selfish.", "NAH.   unless you persist in making a big deal out of a mild disagreement.", "YTA for not getting there earlier and for then blaming your husband for actually wanting to see his child perform. he chose a seat where this was possible.", "YTA, mainly for not letting it go after an extended period of time. You were there to watch your daughter. So was he. That is really all that mattered. It's possible that your daughter looked out from the stage and saw her father closer to the front and Mom and sibling closer to the back, but I don't think that ruined anything for her. But listening to the two of you argue, might be making her feel terrible, as if it's somehow her fault. So stop already. I'm sure if there's another event, your husband will know that it's important to have him sit with the rest of the family.", "YTA. You were there to see your daughter perform, not to form a family huddle, so if you could see better from nearer the front it's logical to go there.", "YTA, I mean honestly this is a petty disagreement, does it really matter in the end that he preferred and chose a seat closer to the front.  You didn't get a choice of seats or seats together because for WHATEVER reason you were running late.  So assuming that you act like adults you both took seats where you could, even if they werent together.  Is this a hill you really want to die on?", "ESH. Cut the poor dude some slack, give him back his balls for God's sake. Yeah, it's a d\\*ck move, I get it, but come on, we all know how these events turn out to be. He showed up at least, that's already more than what most dads would do, you can believe me on this one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also just because they sat apart doesn't mean they're not gonna re-group after the event!", "How is he awful I personally think nah", "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. ;o)", "Furious seems accurate and acceptable. He selfishly grabbed a better seat even tho he SAW the op had saved him a seat, AND he left OP with their younger child. Grossly selfish.", "English is not my first language. Irritated is the correct term.", "He was still in the 10th row. Also our child's performance came around an hour later but he continued to sit there till the end.", "Should she have screamed at his across the crowded room??", "Why is it up to OP to get there earlier and find better seating for the entire family??", "They were late because the husband had a meeting. Why would it be her responsibility to get their early? Is it also her responsibility to have to take care of the younger child during the performance? Husband is a selfish AH.", "Do you lack social skills? It's usually expected if you enter somewhere as a group to sit next to each other unless specified. There's nothing wrong with wanting to sit at the front, but it's expected he at least says something about it. Plus he left her alone with their other child to look after- despite the fact that they are both parents, and nothing was said about it.", "They weren\u2019t running late for *whatever reason*. They were late because of husbands meeting. She saved him a seat, yet he ignored that seat to find himself, *and only himself*, a better seat, leaving her to be the sole parent to take care of the younger child. Totally selfish!!!!\n> \nThe very least he could have done was take the younger child and put on his lap. \n>\nI don\u2019t blame OP one bit for being pissed.", "What a gross comment. You need to raise the bar on what is expected from dads. You\u2019re drowning in misogyny.", "So it\u2019s the OPs responsibility to also be solely responsible for the younger child during the performances?", "We make assumptions every day about tons of things because we have cultural norms and expectations. This saves us from discussing the same over and over.\n\nThe person who wants to deviate from the expectations is responsible for saying so, and shouldn't expect the other people guessing.\n\nAlso, discussing afterwards is hrat but different than experiencing at the same time.", "to see his daughter ffs!! lol and it's not like he wasn't in the room. If OP or the younger one needed him he was literally right there.", "ok that makes you less of an AH but still not a big deal", "It sounds like something I would have done in his place. My objective would have been, find a seat right away, instead of wandering around, saying excuse me, stepping over people's feet, etc. The performance was starting. I would want to be seated and out of the way no matter what.", "She gave him a \u201cgo ahead gesture\u201d instead of \u201ccome here\u201d. \n\nClearly she misunderstood his intentions, and maybe she should have realized that instead of seething at him.", "Probably because she's a woman, sadly.\ud83d\ude15", "if it was THAT important for her she would have gotten there early, but she was content to wait for her Husband. At least one parent sat in front so the kid could see they were there.

And what's wrong with the younger kid that it takes two people to look after it at a dance performance?\n\nSure, sitting together would be nice, but not at the cost of not seeing the show.", "lol she added the edit conveniently later. There was no mentioning on why they were late when she posted first", "The bar is already set too high for them, and you want to raise it higher.

She did, but wasn\u2019t selfish about it. \n>\nHe was not *literally right there*. Had the OP needed to use the washroom she would have had to leave their seats (resulting in potentially losing their seats), make their way through the audience members to get to her selfish AH husband, and explain where she was going.", "Lol why would someone assume their spouse is going to sit somewhere else?", "So you\u2019re saying that women and children should be thankful for the very bare minimum from their husbands and fathers because so many men are worse husbands and fathers??\n>\nThis is incredibly disgusting and disturbing. I hope you seek therapy to resolve whatever issues are causing you to think in this incredibly unhealthy manner.", "Lol whaaaat?? Wrong. She should NOT have to communicate that he should be equally responsible for his own children. Why is it considered \u201chelping\u201d when it\u2019s the father, but an expected obligation for the mother????\nHe\u2019s a parent who has equal responsibility.", "As the father and husband, it actually is something he should be automatically be doing. If she does it, why can\u2019t he? Is he not a parent? Does he not share equal responsibility for outings?     \nIs him being a father and husband somehow an excuse for him to be negligent in the most basic of tasks and duties to his family?", "\"It's OP's responsibility to communicate that a father must help parent his child\" is an absolutely nutty take.", "And her husband has 0 responsibility to communicate and ask if she\u2019d be comfortable handling the younger one without him?", "Whether she shouldve had to or not she needed to once she figured out he was actually sitting down and not just scoping.
