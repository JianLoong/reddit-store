We got engaged over Christmas 2021 and sent out our save the dates in February 2022. \n\nI gave my mum the invitations for my aunts family just after Christmas, as she was seeing her before I would and I wanted to save on postage. My mum and my aunt talk everyday and are really close, and the day after she received our invitations my aunt told my mum that she didn\u2019t think my cousin would be coming anymore, because his girlfriend of 6 months wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nMy mum relayed this information to me - at first I was really upset that my cousin would say something like that. Now I\u2019m just angry tbh. We were really close growing up, he\u2019s a few years younger than me and he and my brother and I would hang out every week growing up, I always considered him my closest cousin. But now we\u2019re adults we don\u2019t live that close to each other so don\u2019t see each other that regularly, and I haven\u2019t met his new girlfriend.  I have essentially been threatened with \u201cif his girlfriend isn\u2019t invited to the wedding he\u2019s not coming\u201d by my aunt, trying to make me cater to their wishes. I\u2019m absolutely steadfast that I don\u2019t want anyone at my wedding that me and my partner don\u2019t know well - it\u2019s not even about the money of having a stranger there, it\u2019s just about the principal. I don\u2019t want people there on the most special day of my life that I literally don\u2019t know. I have never met her, never had a conversation with her, she wasn\u2019t even known to my cousin when the save the dates went out. \n\nMy mum is totally on my side, but my aunt and cousin and their family all think that everyone invited to a wedding should essentially automatically be given a plus one, which I categorically do not agree with, and they are trying to guilt trip me by saying \u201cyou can\u2019t not have him there it would be horrible\u201d even though he\u2019s the one making threats about not coming unless he can bring his latest squeeze. I just feel like all the flack I\u2019m getting from them just isn\u2019t worth the hassle and I feel like I\u2019m going to cave, but I don\u2019t want to give in to their demands out of convenience - but AITA for being so strict about one person? It\u2019s nothing against her. Should I just let her come? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the one being a bitch, I don\u2019t know what the wedding etiquette is. Should your nearest and dearest be automatically allowed a plus one? AITA?\n\nEDIT: for extra context.  \nThere\u2019s no other \u201cplus ones\u201d invited to the wedding.  Everyone we\u2019ve invited has been named on the invitation, and for couples, if we know the other half well, they\u2019re invited.  All of the couples except for my cousins have been together very long term so we know them well, which makes my cousins case a bit unique. But nobody, not even the single people, has been given a plus one.\n\nEDIT #2: appreciate peoples responses, there\u2019s definitely been a mixture. Just wanted to clarify that I don\u2019t think my cousin is being unreasonable for saying he\u2019s not coming - attendance isn\u2019t mandatory, obviously. Just as we made the choice not to invite his girlfriend, he\u2019s made the choice not to attend, that\u2019s all fair enough. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not sad he would rather not come, but it\u2019s fair nonetheless. The issue is more the \u201cthreat\u201d of trying to make me change the guest list to accommodate the desires of others, when we\u2019re only inviting our nearest and dearest.  I\u2019m also not against meeting her as some have suggested - I\u2019d love to meet her, my auntie has told me she\u2019s lovely and gets on really well with them all. But meeting her isn\u2019t going to change the fact she will not be one of the close people we want on our wedding day.  I don\u2019t know if adding that the guest list is approximately 70 people is relevant - we both have very big very close families, and great friends we\u2019ve known forever, so even though 70 may seem like a lot it\u2019s still only our closest people. The idea of a \u201cbig\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d wedding is somewhat subjective anyway if you ask me, I\u2019d probably call ours medium sized but the invite list is rather close knit. :)\n\nEDIT #3: to respond to some common questions. \n\nNo, I haven\u2019t actually spoken directly to my cousin about this but am definitely going to, just to politely explain my reasoning and tell him I will accept his decision, and hopefully reach an amicable understanding. He told his mum \u201ctell her I\u2019m not coming if she\u2019s not\u201d which is what my mum and later my auntie have told me. So not heard it directly from him, no.  But I have been told he was quite annoyed and quite harshly told my auntie to tell me this. \nNo, nobody else has a plus one. Only named people are invited, people we are close to. That\u2019s our choice. \nNo, I would not be offended if when they get married in 9 years my husband isn\u2019t invited. I would never even assume I would be invited - and yes even if my husband wasn\u2019t going I would still go if I was otherwise able. \nYes, I am the asshole for referring to her as the latest squeeze. Disrespectful, didn\u2019t intend to be but it is and I accept that. \nI\u2019m UK based - as far as I know the etiquette is quite different in the US, which might explain the mixed responses. Interesting to hear different takes. I personally have been to many weddings, only 1 where plus ones/ dates were given - and that wedding was paid for by aforementioned auntie, for her eldest child", "created_utc": 1673728128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10byhe5/aita_for_refusing_to_give_in_to_my_cousins/", "score": 514, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think this would be different if your cousin was in a longer, more stable relationship--if, in essence, this was his partner, a new family member whom you just hadn't met yet. However this seems to be a new relationship for him...and no, there is no 'automatic plus one' included in wedding invitation. He is not entitled to bring a date to an event he's not throwing himself.\n\nYou are NTA for not inviting his new girlfriend. He is NTA if he \\*politely\\* declines the invitation for whatever reason. All of your family members telling you it's \"horrible\" of you to not cater to his request are the AHs.

I think that's germane.\n\nIt's pretty common with smaller weddings to keep it to people you know personally, and even if it weren't it's your wedding and you can invite who you like. *However*, that said, it's an invitation, not a command, and if your cousin doesn't want to attend that's fine, and that's also the attitude you should have. \"Of course we're excited to have him there on our special day, but if he can't make it we understand and wish him the best. We'll be streaming the wedding on Facebook so hopefully he can attend virtually!\" Kind, upbeat, reasonable: that's the tone you want to take.\n\nOffering plus ones to everyone you invite is fine when you are having a huge wedding; when you are having a more intimate event or your venue is small or it's a destination wedding, it's just not feasible and expectations should change.", "NAH, but you're getting close to the line. Rethink some of your words here.. he's not \"threatening\" you and there's no need to speak about his gf with such degrading words as \"latest squeeze\". You gave out invitations and he declined. End of story. Nobody is forcing you to do anything, but you can't demand or force him to come to your wedding either. You have boundaries and so has he. They just happen not to align this time. That doesn't mean that others should simply bend to your will. \n\nMany people don't want to attend a wedding alone when they're in a relationship, while others care less. You don't get to dictate how others feel about that. \n\nYour \"boundaries\" have consequences in this case, you just don't want to accept it.", "NAH\n\nNot wanting to give your cousin a plus one is not unreasonable.

Your wedding, your call!", "I would say general wedding etiquette is to allow guests to have a plus one, especially if you know they have a partner or bf/gf, unless it is a very small wedding. But generally it is up to the couple to decide the guest list and who they want to come, since it ultimately is their wedding. \n\nIt sounds as though you are making this a larger deal than it really is. If you refuse to give people plus ones, you need to be ok with some people not coming because they don't want to come without their significant other.

But the most important thing is that, if you have a dividing line, it has to be the same for everyone.\n\nIf you want to be super-traditional in an upper class WASP way, the old rule was that \"established\" couples (married or engaged, or living in what used to be called sin) were treated as one single unit. The catch-phrase was \"no ring, no bring\". It caught on for a while until people realized that there were legitimate exceptions to the rule.

We both had friends and family scattered around the country, so there were plenty of guests that one of us had not met prior.  And some guests of guests that neither of us had met.  The wedding was beautiful.  Many people said it was the most lovely wedding they had ever attended.   \n\nYou sound like a narrow minded narcissist.

Yes, you theoretically have the final say about who is invited to your wedding.  BUT, there are some important points here:\n-It sounds as if you never spoke directly to your cousin or even your aunt.  This is like a game of telephone.  Your aunt or mother may be more upset than your cousin. \n-On one hand you are following the (American) custom of setting a date far in advance and sending out save the date notices.  If you do that, you need to be consistent.  You can afford to pay for save the date cards but can\u2019t afford postage?  Come on\u2026. \n-It is customary if you have a big enough wedding to have save the date cards, then you allow your key guests to bring a significant other.  Although technically it\u2019s your gig and you can do whatever you want, what you\u2019re doing is breaking with tradition.\n-If you want to throw tradition out the window, get married in your living room with only your closest friends and family.  Make it as impromptu and low key as possible.  If you\u2019re trying to save on postage, perhaps you should consider eloping. Then you could have a party sometime down the road and be looser about who you invite.\n-You announced got engaged 18 months before your wedding.  You sent out save the date cards 14 months in advance, and you distributed invites 6 months prior to the wedding.  And your cousin has only been dating this person 6 months.

I guess my issue is more with the fact that it was then put back on me to invite her with the threat of \u201cor I won\u2019t come\u201d. If he\u2019d quietly declined, and then maybe if I\u2019d asked \u201cwhy, was he working, other commitments etc\u201d and he cited the reason, then fair enough.  But you\u2019re totally right, we had the choice to not invite, he has the choice to decline. I\u2019m just upset in the way it\u2019s been handled, and honestly that someone I love wouldn\u2019t want to be there on my wedding day. But that\u2019s my problem", "100% agree with this tbh.

The comments have really helped rationalise and give me some perspective. \n\nSo you\u2019re correct, I haven\u2019t spoken directly to my cousin about it. I have heard from my aunt that he got quite annoyed and said \u201cwe\u2019ll I\u2019m not coming if she isn\u2019t\u201d.

There\u2019s not a single stranger as a guest, and I\u2019d prefer to keep it that way but I also don\u2019t want to rock the boat, I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s considered reasonable and unreasonable. I just wish everyone would just let a couple getting married do exactly what they want and not take things so personally", "True, I\u2019m definitely feeling raw about it right now. I love him and I\u2019d love him to be there. I\u2019d like to think he loves me enough to be able to spend half a day without her, and understand our choice in not inviting her. It is literally nothing personal, we just only want our closest people there. But you\u2019re right, it is his choice, as it was ours to invite or not, and we\u2019ve all got to accept that.

I don\u2019t mean it to be a disrespect to the relationship. Yea, calling her the latest squeeze is definitely disrespectful and I shouldn\u2019t have phrased it like that. But the decision is solely about wanting our closest people only present, and not having the budget to allow everyone\u2019s new partners/ dates.

Thank you for helping me have that realisation. We are all adults, we made the choice not to invite her, he has made the choice not to attend. That\u2019s fair. I\u2019m just feeling upset about it because I obviously love him, but at the end of the day I believe we\u2019ve all made fair choices.  What a shame I\u2019m so cheap and not rich enough to invite every single person I know and don\u2019t know to my wedding that I have to pay for, how horrible for me to be so poor but wanting to get married :((( I guess you can only get married if you\u2019re privileged enough to be able invite anyone that may want/expect to attend rather than being selective.

My thinking was that I\u2019d rather have people get them together than discussing amongst themselves \u201cwhat did you pick off EndlessRays&Partners wedding menu\u201d and being upset to have no got an invitation, and I wasn\u2019t able to reach my auntie til the following weekend due to distance.", "Oh god :( yeah I wouldn\u2019t want that to happen.

You have no idea how much of this is his mother's voice and how he really feels.", "Yes, that's very true and costs will add up quickly if there are that many plus-ones.

Makes perfect sense that you don\u2019t want someone there you don\u2019t know however if they end up staying together you might end up being disliked by her and that could bring a whole host of trouble down the road. \n\nI think you being \u201cangry\u201d about him not wanting to attend does make you sound entitled, you were close as kids but barely see each other now, there\u2019s certainly no reason to expect any loyalty from someone you barely know anymore.\n\nI can\u2019t decide if YTA or NTA \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.

You\u2019re commenting on all her replies, you are not being objective and you are coming across as extremely angry.
