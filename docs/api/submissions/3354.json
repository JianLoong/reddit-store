Definitely NTA. you called a spade a spade and were honest without deliberately trying to be hurtful. After hearing what your MIL is like I\u2019m happy for you and your husband that he didn\u2019t turn out to be anything like his mother.\n\nDoes she just think that bc she raised him that he owes her for that? If so she\u2019s sorely mistaken. Maybe she should\u2019ve planned for her retirement better if she wanted to have more money.", "I don\u2019t exactly know how to answer this. Definitely not NTA because there is no way I can say that your MIL isn\u2019t being an AH. You spoke the truth. But what does escalating this conflict do for your life? It sounds like your MIL has always been this way. She isn\u2019t likely to change. I think you actually handled it right by just hanging up the phone. I understand being upset about your child being brought into this(he shouldn\u2019t have been) and would definitely evaluate what their level of contact should be going forward. You should talk to your son and take his lead.\n\nAlso with the \u201cghetto\u201d sister (I don\u2019t really like that word) why are you picking up the phone? Just say you don\u2019t really want to discuss it and then don\u2019t pick up. I think in general you need to work on some boundary setting with your husband\u2019s family. Ideally he should be handling any conflicts, as in if you really wanted to bring it to her attention that you don\u2019t want her talking about this to your son, he should communicate that with her. It sounds like a challenging situation and hopefully you can use this to figure out what the relationship will look like going forward.", "NTA next time she asks for money, pay her in pennies.", "Wowie wow wow. NTA. \n\nThe audacity of your MIL to think that she is deserving of more of your husband\u2019s finances, when she gave you a crumpled up $10 bill for a wedding present, is just too much. It also sounds like MIL is not struggling either, so..\n\nUnless we\u2019re missing info on some sort of grand gestures that MIL has performed over the years, she is definitely not deserving of any more money.", "Nah you\u2019re good", "NTA\n\nDragging your son into it is absolute no-no, massive ah-move. No more unsupervised calls/visits (or encourage your kid to simply end a call polite&firm way if she starts).", "NTA MIL is manipulating a child? No. As an old lady, I think this is reprehensible to involve a child in her game playing.", "NTA. In my opinion you and your son should have no contact with MIL. Everything needs to go through your husband, but ONLY if he is strong enough to resist her crocodile tears.", "The truth hurts.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She mean.", "ESH, your MIL for behaving the way she's behaving, and you for using the word ghetto which suggests you're a snob and a bigot.", "How does the word ghetto suggest I'm a bigot?", "https://time.com/5684505/ghetto-word-history/"]}
