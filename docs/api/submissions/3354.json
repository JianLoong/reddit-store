Definitely NTA. you called a spade a spade and were honest without deliberately trying to be hurtful. After hearing what your MIL is like I\u2019m happy for you and your husband that he didn\u2019t turn out to be anything like his mother.\n\nDoes she just think that bc she raised him that he owes her for that? If so she\u2019s sorely mistaken. Maybe she should\u2019ve planned for her retirement better if she wanted to have more money.", "I don\u2019t exactly know how to answer this. Definitely not NTA because there is no way I can say that your MIL isn\u2019t being an AH. You spoke the truth. But what does escalating this conflict do for your life? It sounds like your MIL has always been this way. She isn\u2019t likely to change. I think you actually handled it right by just hanging up the phone. I understand being upset about your child being brought into this(he shouldn\u2019t have been) and would definitely evaluate what their level of contact should be going forward. You should talk to your son and take his lead.\n\nAlso with the \u201cghetto\u201d sister (I don\u2019t really like that word) why are you picking up the phone? Just say you don\u2019t really want to discuss it and then don\u2019t pick up. I think in general you need to work on some boundary setting with your husband\u2019s family. Ideally he should be handling any conflicts, as in if you really wanted to bring it to her attention that you don\u2019t want her talking about this to your son, he should communicate that with her. It sounds like a challenging situation and hopefully you can use this to figure out what the relationship will look like going forward.", "NTA next time she asks for money, pay her in pennies.", "Wowie wow wow. NTA. \n\nThe audacity of your MIL to think that she is deserving of more of your husband\u2019s finances, when she gave you a crumpled up $10 bill for a wedding present, is just too much. It also sounds like MIL is not struggling either, so..\n\nUnless we\u2019re missing info on some sort of grand gestures that MIL has performed over the years, she is definitely not deserving of any more money.", "Nah you\u2019re good", "NTA\n\nDragging your son into it is absolute no-no, massive ah-move. No more unsupervised calls/visits (or encourage your kid to simply end a call polite&firm way if she starts).", "NTA MIL is manipulating a child? No. As an old lady, I think this is reprehensible to involve a child in her game playing.", "NTA. In my opinion you and your son should have no contact with MIL. Everything needs to go through your husband, but ONLY if he is strong enough to resist her crocodile tears.", "The truth hurts.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She mean.", "ESH, your MIL for behaving the way she's behaving, and you for using the word ghetto which suggests you're a snob and a bigot.\n\nETA: from the discussion below, I see I may be wrong about the word ghetto. The people I know in the US who use it are snobs and borderline racist imho, but I'm not from the US and I'm happy to admit that the word may have a wider range of everyday usage than I knew about.", "How does the word ghetto suggest I'm a bigot?", "https://time.com/5684505/ghetto-word-history/\n\nETA:\n\nSince people are so quick to think \u201cwhite savior\u201d and not read the article, there\u2019s also anti-Semitic history with the word \u201cghetto.\u201d I shared the link hoping people would take a two minutes to learn something that isn\u2019t often taught in schools that\u2019s extremely important.", "MIL likely gives money to the SIL, and got her involved. MIL had years to work, and SIL can work too.\n\nI wouldn't harp on a wedding gift from 30 years ago, but I WOULD be very angry that she told my son to pass along such a manipulative, despicable, greedy message.", "NTA sounds like she raises a nice cash cow for herself, and is not mad that he didn't stay and keep providing for her. I understand if she was saying,'I don't have any savings. I can't work. That extra money helped me a lot.' OK, that's far more understanding. But what does she want with it?\n\nAll you stated was she says: \"money, money, money\" surely she has said why she is demanding it?", "Info: what do you mean by \u201cghetto sister\u201d?", "NTA\n\nIf the shoe fits...", "NTA. I'd have felt a little bad for the mom if she'd not said horrible things and/or not given a shitty wedding present. Sister should learn to fend for herself and her kids", "NTA - If it makes you feel any better, my Dad\u2019s mother was very similar & I grew to dislike her (she also was incredibly rude to me as the years went on) but mainly because of her trying to manipulate my dad & his younger brother over money. She would go as far as lying about needing dental work to try and get my dad to pay for a cruise she wanted to go on with my aunts. When my dad offered to pay the dentist directly, she tried to shame him for not just cutting her a check. Never mind that one of the aunts let it slip that they had been planning a cruise. She wanted over $1,500 out of my dad, which was ridiculous at the time\u2026 that would have covered her and the aunts. My dad is such a nice guy that had she just straight up asked him to book her the cruise as a gift, he\u2019d have done it. It was the lying & manipulation & trying to get him to pay for his sisters too that made me so angry. \n\nI should point out that my dad had sent her money every year just to be nice & let her treat herself to dinner out every month. He helped her live a comfortable life. \n\nOH and when she died, it turned out she had been hoarding her life savings & she gave it all to my aunts. I didn\u2019t even get so much as a family photo album out of her. She left me nothing and I was her ONLY grandchild. \n\nIn the end, I told her I forgave her being rude to me (she would insult me & laugh about it) & that I forgave her for trying to exploit my father\u2019s kindness. But I told her I knew exactly who she was & that God did too. \n\nAnyways, my point is that your MIL needs to be told by your husband that what she did is totally inappropriate & she isn\u2019t to ever say anything like that to her grandson again. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d And after that, I would limit my contact with her. I avoided my grandmother for the last 5 years of her life, minus seeing her at Christmas. And I don\u2019t regret it one bit.", "NTA but don't be saying Ghetto before you become the asshole for other reasons.", "Overall NTA, though I think it was very unnecessary to mention the $10. It sounds like you\u2019ve been fixated on a \u201cnot good enough\u201d wedding present for 20 years which is pretty darn petty. It\u2019s not exactly surprising that a woman who regularly mooches money from her own son isn\u2019t going to give a big present (especially when he\u2019s indirectly funding it himself). So like\u2026 she is awful and totally in the wrong but you\u2019d be smelling even more like a rose if you hadn\u2019t made a comment that in turn made you sound greedy.", "NTA, might want to withhold from the word ghetto in the future though.", "Nta you don\u2019t mess with manipulating the babies. See momma bear in action. MIL can go else where with that.", "NTA at all\n\nRemind all these people MIL will be happy to accept their money. They can feel free to send as much as they want. Since it bothers them sooooooo much.", "NTA. Kinda sounds like how my husband paid the mortgage for my MIl and she lost the house anyway not using it right, or how his sisters just expected him to move in when they were between boyfriends or just Jobs to help out and also babysit until I came along. \nMy SIL gifted us \"what she hoped would cover her plate\" at our wedding dinner while my MIL loudly said \"what would you gift them for? They just got married they didn't have a wedding\" because we didn't have a huge to do on her rural farm for her whole family and camp instead.", "NTA- she needed a reality check and you gave it to her. Well done. Sounds like karl is really stand up guy and you should give him a hug and a kiss this evening and tell him he's great", "NTA", "NTA. Your MIL is out there and over the top. She absolutely needed to hear everything that you said. It was just time to draw a major line in the sand. I would cut off her sister and anyone else who feels they need to negatively comment on the situation. There is just no excuse in the world for your MIL and her behavior.", "Nta", "NTA. Good for you for calling MIL out on her behavior and expectations. MIL's sister was misinformed. You never said you yelled at her. You **told** her. That's different.  You called her greedy and ungrateful, both true. When she starts \"crying\" you should boo hoo right back at her. MIL, do you want to take food out of your grandchildren's mouths? Take clothes off their backs? Have us live in the street?", "NTA.

Your dad sounds like a fantastic human and you too.", "I know your intentions are good, and you sound like you want peace more than anything, but I have a problem with \"MIL has always been this way. She isn\u2019t likely to change\" I'd like to explain.\n\nThat line of thought has been used many, many times to allow bullies and abusers to continue their behavior. It is often coupled with \"you'll only make it worse by saying something.\"\n\nJust because OPs MIL has always been that way doesn't mean she doesn't need to finally be confronted with her behavior, especially in this case where OP's MIL is involving OP's children to pass passive aggressive messages to OP's husband.\n\nI disagree that she isn't likely to change. If she has never been confronted with her behavior she has no reason at all to change. If she is told that her behavior is unacceptable on a consistent basis, each time, without fail, she may very well extinguish the behavior. Could OP have phrased things better? Of course. Should she have just passively ended the call without defending her husband? No.\n\nI say this because of my own MiL. She was very verbally abusive to her children since childhood. The first few times I observed her venomous ways I held my tongue and was told \"that's just the way she is.\"\n\nOnce I began calling her out on her behavior, every time, the family was shocked that someone stood up to her, despite the hysterics that being called out elicited. Once she learned to hold her tongue with my wife everyone was amazed.", "[removed]", "I don't know, one year my dad gave my grandma $100 to buy Christmas presents for me and my three cousins and she bought us each an ugly fake pearl ornament and then spent the remaining $80 on a pair of shoes for herself. I was like seven and I still remember that, although we all laugh about it now.", "I'll continue to use the word ghetto as often as I like but thanks for the advice. I won't pander to the desires of everyone who's offended over a word that I'm not using to refer to someone's race, culture nor religion. God bless you.", "Your in-laws sound awful. So sorry.", "I hope my comment makes it clear that they should use the MILs clear abusive behavior to reevaluate their entire relationship with her, and potentially go low or no contact. Nothing about my comment is suggesting peace for anyone but this family. I don\u2019t think confronting abusive people changes them, you can\u2019t change others behavior. You can only change your own. While that can be used to protect abusive people as I am literally suggesting they completely evaluate seeing the MIL at all, it isn\u2019t in this case :).\n\nWhile I am happy to hear that confronting or calling out your abusive MIL worked, that is actually amazing, I haven\u2019t experienced that or seen it working a lot. I feel most severely toxic people are very set in their ways. It\u2019s possible that setting actual boundaries will cause the MIL to shut down the comments to enjoy her family with her time left. For myself with verbally toxic/abusive family if I confront them or call them out similar to this it just plays into their victim complex. When I set boundaries and strictly control my time with them (if at all) it gives me power and control over the relationship and I better about it.", "Ahhhhh, this right here. This is what makes YTA.", "Considering I grew up living in the projects in one of the worst ghettos in New York, that article means NOTHING to me and I said what I said.

You said she's not wanting for anything but if that was the case why would she miss 150 bucks for her birthday?\nDoes she have a lot of savings or pension? How have you determined that her finances have covered her needs?\n\nI hope when I'm 80 yo, and I'll try my best to provide for myself, but if I'm way off, I'm sure the extras gifted from children can go a long way. \n\nSure, it's not your responsibly but she is your husband's mother.

Just as people are \"allowed\" to make assumptions about you for how you use it.", "NTA", "NTA.  The truth hurts.  Your MIL was using your husband as a bank machine, and she is upset that the bank machine is now only occasionally giving out small denominations.  Your MIL was trying to emotionally manipulate your teenaged son to get him to guilt your husband for money.  Of course your MIL would retaliate by getting her flying monkeys to do her bidding to covertly bully you into submission.  After all, she needs someone to blame versus take responsibility for her actions.  I think it is time that the bank machine stops dispensing cash completely.", "Well done!

It was completely ghetto and unnecessary.", "Yeah I feel people on here are focusing on how satisfying it is to call someone out on their bs. It definitely can be. But honestly bringing up some events from 20 years ago seems like off of the point. Instead, I would just ideally have my husband say if you bring up _____ again with ____ then we will not see you. Somehow people interpreted this as giving into abusers, but I feel like for at least the members of my family this gives them what they ultimately want-a victim narrative and attention/sympathy. Only by holding firm boundaries can you achieve true peace.", "oh ew way to turn my opinion on you 180, the god bless you doesn't help your case either lmao talk about a tacky response", "NTA, you handled things 100% properly.

Maybe, but sometimes people need a hard dose of reality.", "NTA, but your husband's family: wow!  Adults can deal with a manipulative, dishonest user willing to say anything to get money, but children, less so.  This is your son's grandma casting aspersions on his dad, confusing and so wrong.  If there is some way you could get your son on board to block grandma on his phone and has his calls with her go through you, on speaker.  I hope that knowing she can't manipulate your son in the shadows will keep your MIL more appropriate.  (I say this as a person who had a grandparent who badmouthed one of my parents to me when I was a bit older than your son.  It was profoundly disturbing.  To this day I remember some of the things that were said.  Protect your kid.)", "NTA -\n\nIt was HUGELY inappropriate for dear old granny to even bring this up to your son!!\n\nYeah, this woman is not about love and nurturing but truly sounds greedy and entitled.  She mentioned she misses the MONEY not her son or anything meaningful.  All you did is call her out on her greed.  Unless she really NEEDS extra funds I would suggest hubby stop helping mom full stop and only give her money or gifts on bday, Christmas and Mother's Day.  Everything else full stop - she doesn't appreciate anything he's done for her and only comments on what he's NOT doing now.  Remind her that out of all her children he is the ONLY one who did and does things for her - but since it's not appreciated then it's going to stop!  Obviously you can only do this if your husband is on board with this as well - but you guys need to agree on something to do about her and her behavior.  Good luck!", "NTA. Protect yourself AND YOUR FAMILY. Good for you for nailing her behavior toward your son.", "NTA!! That was amazing! I especially love how you handled it when she was on speaker phone. Really good parenting right there!", "At 13, my grandma basically said my parents and I were not going to be in heaven with her and my brother. It never hurt me because I know how she is. Just in one ear out the other and makes for a funny story here and there."]}
