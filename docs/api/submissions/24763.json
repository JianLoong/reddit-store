Skye is dancing with her mom and her granddad, the two people who raised her. Skye wanted to know if I had any plans to dance with anyone. I told her I would likely ask my grandparents on my mom's side. They're the people I would be closest to.\n\nI asked my grandparents and they were over the moon. Grandpa even started practicing for it. My grandma was a little more emotional about it because my mom died when I was only seven and for my grandma, it was a reminder that she and grandpa had to step in for some stuff so it could feel as close to having mom there as possible.\n\nThe reason I asked my grandparents is I am not close to my dad or his wife. My dad is a cold man. He was always that way. After our mom died it was my grandparents who were there for my younger brother and I. Dad would tell us to stop trying to make him something he wasn't. The only time he wanted emotion from us was his second wedding to his wife. \n\nShe dreamed of stepping in and becoming our mom and filling in the gaps mom left behind. We never wanted her to do that. In fact for years my brother and I hated her for trying to fill in for mom. She was a stranger, some woman our dad chose, who was nothing to us. She went too far at times and because of that in my heart she never became my stepmom and instead remained my dad's wife. My brother feels the same way.\n\nShe's not a terrible person. Some would say we should have welcomed her efforts and appreciated them. But she was stepping all over our mom in our eyes. When she'd put her name down under mom instead of legal guardian. When she'd buy herself Mother's Day cards and put our names on a card that said best mom. When she cut my brothers hair against his wishes because it bothered her that it was almost exactly like mom's hair and she hated it being pointed out. When she tried to guilt us into watching her give birth when we didn't want to. When she tried to force me to bring her to some mother/son dance and cried because I refused.\n\nToday I have a minimal, more low contact relationship with them. So she was never going to be someone I asked. But she heard through my dad's parents that I was planning the dance with my grandparents and she asked me to do a mother/son dance with her. I said no. I didn't give a reason or make a discussion. Just no. She started crying again and told me that we loved crushing her and putting her in her place when all she ever wanted was to love us.\n\nShe's mad and so  are my dad and his parents. They said my brother and I always treated her unfairly and I should have agreed to the dance after all these years of her trying.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692176706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15skj35/aita_for_saying_no_to_a_motherson_dance_at_my/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The wounds from your mother's passing and the way your dad's wife tried to insert herself into your lives are still very raw for you and your brother. You're entitled to your feelings and boundaries, especially during such a personal and important event as your wedding.\n\nIt's understandable that your dad's wife may have genuinely wanted to bridge the gap and create a loving relationship, but her actions, as you've described them, seemed to have overstepped and caused distress for both of you. While some may argue that you should have extended an olive branch, your decision to prioritize your own emotional well-being and comfort on your wedding day is valid. It's essential to consider your own feelings and healing process first and foremost.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this decision has caused hurt feelings, but your boundaries and emotional health should be respected. It's a complicated situation, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional healing over trying to accommodate others who might not understand the depth of your experiences.", "NTA\n\n>She's mad and so are my dad and his parents.\n\n That's their problem, not yours. Congrats on your wedding.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA here. She has made you deeply uncomfortable on many occasions and has tried to make everyone stop referencing your actual mom in conversation. That\u2019s incredibly insensitive and she\u2019s definitely not deserving of a dance with you. Plus, you can do whatever you want on YOUR wedding day. Hell, you could dance with a pet if you want.", "\"When she cut my brothers hair against his wishes because it bothered her that it was almost exactly like mom's hair and she hated it being pointed out.\"\n\nThis really stuck out for me.  She forcefully cut your brother's hair because he looked like your mom.  If her over reach wasn't difficult enough this alone pretty much torpedoed you and your brother ever considering her to be a material figure in your life. \n\nNTA", "NTA - and congratulations on your nuptial!", "NTA, people don't get that she was way overstepping and emotionally abusive. You do NOT have to be grateful to someone who is trying to manipulated affection to people that don't want it. You can't force a role on someone that doesn't want to play. You had a mom, she tried to bastardize that. End of discussion. She is your dad's wife (a dad who sounds to also be emotionally abusive). Thank God for your maternal Grandparents. It's only 3 min my axx. The disgust would ruin the whole night for me, and who are you sucking it up for own your special day? This isn't Christmas or Thanksgiving. And you can choose not to be touch by an unrelated female on your wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou don't consider her your mom or your parent. You dad and his family are TA for forcing that.", "NTA - I could give you a long answer giving you every reason for this but, frankly, it comes down to the fact that you get to have your wedding the way you want it with the people you love and care for. If that doesn\u2019t include your father\u2019s wife then it doesn\u2019t and that is OK.", "I thought that MAYBE you didn\u2019t give her a fair shot, but good grief, some of the things you said she did were downright creepy. She may have had good intentions but this is a classic case of someone forcing their love onto you so hard you start to resent them.\n\nNTA, you can do what you want at your own wedding. If she wants any semblance of a good relationship with you, respecting your boundaries on this and celebrating your day accordingly is a start.", "NTA. \nKeep saying No. \nEvery guilt trip should be made with \"That's very unfortunate.\".", "NTA at all.

They are under the impression she tried to be a mother figure, but this story shows her trying to erase your mother. Not the same thing. It's quite cruel, actually.\n\nIt might not be worth salvaging a relationship with a cold man and his potentially cruel wife, but it could be worth an honest discussion with your grandparents.\n\nWeddings are not the time to fix relationships. It's the time to celebrate those that have been actively built. Enjoy your wedding precisely with who you want to.

NTA, and if she keeps having hysterics, feel free to uninvite this woman.\n\n>They said my brother and I always treated her unfairly and I should have agreed to the dance after all these years of her trying.\n\nThey don't want you to rock the boat, because that would mean dealing with your dad's wife's behaviour. No is a full sentence that they should accept. If they think it's unfair.. that invite can be rescinded from them as well. Then they can have an unfair pity party together. NTA and best wishes for your wedding.", "NTA your grandparents sound like wonderful people who will absolutely remember the moment you offered to them.  On the other side of the coin, it sounds like your stepmom wanted to love and include you and family, however you and siblings refused to accept her... which is not your fault by any means, it's hard to accept someone replacing someone as important as your mother.  Good luck!", "NTA\n\nShe is not your mother. Her attempts to force you and your brother to see her as such have ensured she will never be a maternal figure.

That's not what you do when you truly love someone, when you love someone you listen to them and respect them.                                                She didn't even do you the courtesy of seeing you and your brother as human beings with feelings, whose boundaries were worthy of being respected, she saw you as two human sized dolls. \n\nYou can extend an olive branch when she finally recognises she fucked up, apologises, and stops being so pushy, until then she has absolutely no reason to complain.", "NTA however\u2026 in the grand scheme of things, a dance lasts all of 3 mins, is it worth a fight?", "NTA for not wanting to dance with her and yet dancing with her wouldn\u2019t hurt. She tried to be there for you, but I think your annoyances is misplaced. Your father is the real asshole. His behavior towards you and your brother is why y\u2019all treat his wife that way. I don\u2019t think she deserves the cold shoulder especially if she tried to be \u201cmom\u201d for all these years. In my opinion dance with your grandma first and then give her dance just to be cordial about it.", "Obviously NTA\n\nI only say this because I feel sorry for her. It sounds like she tried to help out but you just didn't want it. Its difficult replacing another mother in a kids life and it will never be the same really. But you can at least acknowledged she tried. Maybe it would be kind to have a dance with her at your wedding regardless, she doesn't sound malicious. (apart from the hair cutting think)\n\nWas she an actual mother to you when your dad brought her into the home?\n\nYou seem to be able to acknowledge the situation didn't aid itself when your dad brought her into your lives but it doesn't seem like you've shown any remorse to her. Perhaps some apologies from both sides are in order? \n\nYou know this situation better than we do so I'll leave it up to you to decide how to proceed.", "YTA for the way you treated your step-mom over the years, but you don\u2019t have to dance with her if you don\u2019t want to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is lucky her's only ruin her relationship with you brothers.", "No. Children aren't responsible for the relationships they have with their caregivers. That's 100% on the adults to cultivate. The relationships you have as adults reflect the foundations they were responsible for building when you were children. It's one of the only relationship dynamics that's so heavily weighted in one direction. \n\nIt was always on her and your dad to create an environment that allowed that relationship to develop and they neglected and overwhelmed you in turn. They were focused on what they wanted and not what you needed. That's still what they're doing. \n\nYou're NTA and you were never the one responsible for those relationships", "sorry, but the actions you describe are not good intentioned mistakes.

They say we should have seen her mistakes as good intentioned and allowed her to be a second mother to us.\n\nThe problem with that is that a) it's not a child's job to fix the mistakes of the adults around them, and b) she would have seen your reaching out as rewarding her persistence and simply wouldn't have recognised her actions as mistakes. \n\nThe plain fact is that she did make mistakes, and as an adult it was her responsibility to realise the mistakes, take a step back and then not do that again. Instead, she's shown a pattern of persistently pushing and pushing and pushing, regardless of how many times you said it was hurtful - and her reaction and everyone's around you is to make it all about her. \n\nNo. You protected your feelings because all of the adults around you refused to. And that's a natural response.\n\nThe failure of your relationship isn't due to your rejection; it's because of her pushiness and refusal to take no for an answer. You probably could have had a much better relationship if she'd left the two of you room to breathe, and respected your love for your mom. Heck, if she'd accepted being step-mom and guardian early on, you might very well have come in your own time to see her as a second mom (never a replacement for your Mom, but maybe sitting by her side in your mind).", "Unequivocally it is not the child's responsibility.\nIf the adult is alienating a child by trying to form a bond with them, the reaction is not to continue to push the bond. I don't know what the correct reaction is, but it's definitely not to push it. Maybe if she was less intense it would have been better, maybe if she hadn't tried to replace your mother until you were older, it would have been better. Who knows.\n\nI didn't see the age you were when your father remarried, but it sounds like you were pretty young.\n\nIf you are an adult and your father remarried, holding on to feelings of your mother being replaced might not be as valid. As an adult I think that we as people would probably look at this situation differently, and it sounds like even you look at the situation now as an adult differently. Honestly though after she continues to do this with you as an adult, even now asking for mother son dance, she's pretty f****** dense...\n\nYou acknowledged that your emotional state aside, she was trying to do something positive, and it's entirely possible that if the situation had worked out differently it could have been a positive thing between you and your stepmother.\n\nBut that's not what happened, she pushed, she alienated. I'm sure that wasn't her intention, but that's what she did. The Expectation for a child to be able to navigate the emotional Waters of that situation is not realistic. \n\nThe expectation that you as the child should have known better, should have been able to put your feelings aside to form a relationship, or anything at all is ridiculous.\n\nYou needed counseling, you needed a supportive parent. With the correct support it's entirely possible that this entire situation could have worked out differently, but it sounds like your dad kind of threw a stranger at you. You don't have a relationship with him, and there's just some random new woman that's there trying to replace your mom. As unfortunate as it is, I don't see any other way the situation could have worked out.

I could understand doing that at first. She just should've stopped when she saw your reaction.", "She lost any sympathy points when she cut a kid's hair because he looked like his mom", "I meant she was probably sad and wanted to fill that role without malice at first... \nAfter that it sounds she was hurt by the rejection and instead of backing off, she chose to push, which caused her to act badly, resulting in more rejection.", "There is absolutely no excuse for her actions involving the hair cut\n\nETA: I'll add I realize you're just trying to bring some perspective towards her actions and what may have driven her to those actions.  I'm thinking of the perspective of the stepkid since I was one.  There's a lot of complex and complicated history between my stepmother and I but I don't think she'd ever had gone so far as to forcibly cut my hair just because I looked like my mom (and I'm a carbon copy of mine).  I think the biggest issue is after the kids rejected her the stepmom didn't manage her own expectations and that makes her a huge asshole"]}
