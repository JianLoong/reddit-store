Skye is dancing with her mom and her granddad, the two people who raised her. Skye wanted to know if I had any plans to dance with anyone. I told her I would likely ask my grandparents on my mom's side. They're the people I would be closest to.\n\nI asked my grandparents and they were over the moon. Grandpa even started practicing for it. My grandma was a little more emotional about it because my mom died when I was only seven and for my grandma, it was a reminder that she and grandpa had to step in for some stuff so it could feel as close to having mom there as possible.\n\nThe reason I asked my grandparents is I am not close to my dad or his wife. My dad is a cold man. He was always that way. After our mom died it was my grandparents who were there for my younger brother and I. Dad would tell us to stop trying to make him something he wasn't. The only time he wanted emotion from us was his second wedding to his wife. \n\nShe dreamed of stepping in and becoming our mom and filling in the gaps mom left behind. We never wanted her to do that. In fact for years my brother and I hated her for trying to fill in for mom. She was a stranger, some woman our dad chose, who was nothing to us. She went too far at times and because of that in my heart she never became my stepmom and instead remained my dad's wife. My brother feels the same way.\n\nShe's not a terrible person. Some would say we should have welcomed her efforts and appreciated them. But she was stepping all over our mom in our eyes. When she'd put her name down under mom instead of legal guardian. When she'd buy herself Mother's Day cards and put our names on a card that said best mom. When she cut my brothers hair against his wishes because it bothered her that it was almost exactly like mom's hair and she hated it being pointed out. When she tried to guilt us into watching her give birth when we didn't want to. When she tried to force me to bring her to some mother/son dance and cried because I refused.\n\nToday I have a minimal, more low contact relationship with them. So she was never going to be someone I asked. But she heard through my dad's parents that I was planning the dance with my grandparents and she asked me to do a mother/son dance with her. I said no. I didn't give a reason or make a discussion. Just no. She started crying again and told me that we loved crushing her and putting her in her place when all she ever wanted was to love us.\n\nShe's mad and so  are my dad and his parents. They said my brother and I always treated her unfairly and I should have agreed to the dance after all these years of her trying.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692176706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15skj35/aita_for_saying_no_to_a_motherson_dance_at_my/", "score": 2076, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The wounds from your mother's passing and the way your dad's wife tried to insert herself into your lives are still very raw for you and your brother. You're entitled to your feelings and boundaries, especially during such a personal and important event as your wedding.\n\nIt's understandable that your dad's wife may have genuinely wanted to bridge the gap and create a loving relationship, but her actions, as you've described them, seemed to have overstepped and caused distress for both of you. While some may argue that you should have extended an olive branch, your decision to prioritize your own emotional well-being and comfort on your wedding day is valid. It's essential to consider your own feelings and healing process first and foremost.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this decision has caused hurt feelings, but your boundaries and emotional health should be respected. It's a complicated situation, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional healing over trying to accommodate others who might not understand the depth of your experiences.", "NTA\n\n>She's mad and so are my dad and his parents.\n\n That's their problem, not yours. Congrats on your wedding.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA here. She has made you deeply uncomfortable on many occasions and has tried to make everyone stop referencing your actual mom in conversation. That\u2019s incredibly insensitive and she\u2019s definitely not deserving of a dance with you. Plus, you can do whatever you want on YOUR wedding day. Hell, you could dance with a pet if you want.", "\"When she cut my brothers hair against his wishes because it bothered her that it was almost exactly like mom's hair and she hated it being pointed out.\"\n\nThis really stuck out for me.  She forcefully cut your brother's hair because he looked like your mom.

You do NOT have to be grateful to someone who is trying to manipulated affection to people that don't want it. You can't force a role on someone that doesn't want to play.

It's only 3 min my axx. The disgust would ruin the whole night for me, and who are you sucking it up for own your special day? This isn't Christmas or Thanksgiving.

She may have had good intentions but this is a classic case of someone forcing their love onto you so hard you start to resent them.\n\nNTA, you can do what you want at your own wedding.

They are under the impression she tried to be a mother figure, but this story shows her trying to erase your mother. Not the same thing. It's quite cruel, actually.\n\nIt might not be worth salvaging a relationship with a cold man and his potentially cruel wife, but it could be worth an honest discussion with your grandparents.\n\nWeddings are not the time to fix relationships. It's the time to celebrate those that have been actively built. Enjoy your wedding precisely with who you want to.

No is a full sentence that they should accept. If they think it's unfair.. that invite can be rescinded from them as well. Then they can have an unfair pity party together.

On the other side of the coin, it sounds like your stepmom wanted to love and include you and family, however you and siblings refused to accept her... which is not your fault by any means, it's hard to accept someone replacing someone as important as your mother.  Good luck!", "NTA\n\nShe is not your mother. Her attempts to force you and your brother to see her as such have ensured she will never be a maternal figure.

That's not what you do when you truly love someone, when you love someone you listen to them and respect them.                                                She didn't even do you the courtesy of seeing you and your brother as human beings with feelings, whose boundaries were worthy of being respected, she saw you as two human sized dolls. \n\nYou can extend an olive branch when she finally recognises she fucked up, apologises, and stops being so pushy, until then she has absolutely no reason to complain.", "NTA however\u2026 in the grand scheme of things, a dance lasts all of 3 mins, is it worth a fight?", "NTA for not wanting to dance with her and yet dancing with her wouldn\u2019t hurt. She tried to be there for you, but I think your annoyances is misplaced. Your father is the real asshole. His behavior towards you and your brother is why y\u2019all treat his wife that way. I don\u2019t think she deserves the cold shoulder especially if she tried to be \u201cmom\u201d for all these years. In my opinion dance with your grandma first and then give her dance just to be cordial about it.", "Obviously NTA\n\nI only say this because I feel sorry for her. It sounds like she tried to help out but you just didn't want it. Its difficult replacing another mother in a kids life and it will never be the same really. But you can at least acknowledged she tried. Maybe it would be kind to have a dance with her at your wedding regardless, she doesn't sound malicious.

The relationships you have as adults reflect the foundations they were responsible for building when you were children. It's one of the only relationship dynamics that's so heavily weighted in one direction. \n\nIt was always on her and your dad to create an environment that allowed that relationship to develop and they neglected and overwhelmed you in turn.

They say we should have seen her mistakes as good intentioned and allowed her to be a second mother to us.\n\nThe problem with that is that a) it's not a child's job to fix the mistakes of the adults around them, and b) she would have seen your reaching out as rewarding her persistence and simply wouldn't have recognised her actions as mistakes. \n\nThe plain fact is that she did make mistakes, and as an adult it was her responsibility to realise the mistakes, take a step back and then not do that again. Instead, she's shown a pattern of persistently pushing and pushing and pushing, regardless of how many times you said it was hurtful - and her reaction and everyone's around you is to make it all about her. \n\nNo. You protected your feelings because all of the adults around you refused to. And that's a natural response.\n\nThe failure of your relationship isn't due to your rejection; it's because of her pushiness and refusal to take no for an answer. You probably could have had a much better relationship if she'd left the two of you room to breathe, and respected your love for your mom. Heck, if she'd accepted being step-mom and guardian early on, you might very well have come in your own time to see her as a second mom (never a replacement for your Mom, but maybe sitting by her side in your mind).", "Unequivocally it is not the child's responsibility.\nIf the adult is alienating a child by trying to form a bond with them, the reaction is not to continue to push the bond. I don't know what the correct reaction is, but it's definitely not to push it. Maybe if she was less intense it would have been better, maybe if she hadn't tried to replace your mother until you were older, it would have been better. Who knows.\n\nI didn't see the age you were when your father remarried, but it sounds like you were pretty young.\n\nIf you are an adult and your father remarried, holding on to feelings of your mother being replaced might not be as valid. As an adult I think that we as people would probably look at this situation differently, and it sounds like even you look at the situation now as an adult differently. Honestly though after she continues to do this with you as an adult, even now asking for mother son dance, she's pretty f****** dense...\n\nYou acknowledged that your emotional state aside, she was trying to do something positive, and it's entirely possible that if the situation had worked out differently it could have been a positive thing between you and your stepmother.\n\nBut that's not what happened, she pushed, she alienated. I'm sure that wasn't her intention, but that's what she did. The Expectation for a child to be able to navigate the emotional Waters of that situation is not realistic. \n\nThe expectation that you as the child should have known better, should have been able to put your feelings aside to form a relationship, or anything at all is ridiculous.\n\nYou needed counseling, you needed a supportive parent. With the correct support it's entirely possible that this entire situation could have worked out differently, but it sounds like your dad kind of threw a stranger at you. You don't have a relationship with him, and there's just some random new woman that's there trying to replace your mom.

Your dad not being in your corner sucks, but given the extent of the negatives you said, and the ones you probably didn't say, You owe this woman nothing. \n\nOut of curiosity; you mentioned she gave birth, what's your relationship with your half sibling?", "NTA. Dad needs to take some accountability first,", "NTA. Maybe she and your dad should stop trying to make this - your wedding, your decision, this relationship - something it isn't.  You know, just like your dad taught you.", "thanks for that idea- absolutely forcing my cat to dance with me at the wedding lol", "Right\u2026and before he marries anyone!", "You are so right.  People should really think twice before getting involved with people who already have kids because you can really set yourself up for heartbreak.  Stepparents can\u2019t win because if this stepmom had been cold towards him and his brother, they would have found fault with that.  People should at least be nice to one another\u2026that seems to becoming more lost in society unfortunately.  If I was this stepmom, I would gladly remove myself from attending this wedding and happily give these grown kids all the space they say they\u2019ve been needing.", "Amen!", "Correct!  What\u2019s wrong with the people in this group.  He is definitely YTA for how he treated and continues to treat his stepmom.  She is the one who should be done fooling with his ungrateful self.  I\u2019d tell him to keep his invitation.", "But then criticized if you act like you don\u2019t care\u2026stepparents can\u2019t win either way.  I\u2019d rather have one who showed me love.", "She (and your father) are the ones that completely ruined any potential for you to develop any warm feelings towards her because she didn't just disregard the feelings of children who lost their mother, she proceeded to crap all over them and force herself on you.", "Your dad's wife way overstepped constantly, personally I'd parrot your dad and tell them to stop trying to change your relationship in to something it's not. I hope your wedding day goes perfectly and congratulations.", "She did what she was supposed to do.  She was the matriarch of that home.  She was the mother figure in her home.  You and your brother took your anger out on that woman and sounds like made her home as uncomfortable as you could, and it sounds like you still haven\u2019t matured.  That lady did nothing wrong to you, even by your own words.", "They will need space, but I am sure when they need a babysitter, or if the stepmother had money, and she needed to draw up her will, they will bring up the family card real quick.", "I'll be honest, to me that detail seemed kind of...sad. Like she clearly wanted to be a mom and tried and maybe did that to feel better about marrying a cold man who doesn't like to show affection with two kids who don't like her. \n\nNot that it's the fault of the kids - it is VERY MUCH on her to try and step in without stepping *on* and it sounds like she wasn't able to go about it without disrespecting their actual mother and disregarding their wishes. I understand why OP made the decision he did and he's definitely NTA. But it all just feels so very sad to me, instead of psycho", "NTA.  She should be grateful for an invitation.", "NTA", ">Some would say we should have welcomed her efforts and appreciated them. But she was stepping all over our mom in our eyes. When she'd put her name down under mom instead of legal guardian. When she'd buy herself Mother's Day cards and put our names on a card that said best mom. When she cut my brothers hair against his wishes because it bothered her that it was almost exactly like mom's hair and she hated it being pointed out. When she tried to guilt us into watching her give birth when we didn't want to. When she tried to force me to bring her to some mother/son dance and cried because I refused.\n\nShe sounds unwell. That's not trying, that's overstepping personal boundaries and climbing up your nose. Yikes. NTA.", "What I\u2019m stuck on is that she wanted to make them watch her give birth \ud83d\ude2b", "she cut the kid's hair against his wishes because she didn't like that it looked like their dead mother. She pushed way too much, and in some insensitive ways and that's part of where the anger was placed", "she cut the kid's hair against his wishes because she didn't like that it looked like their dead mother. That's enough right there to get them no to like her", "You can respond that impact is greater than intent, and the impact she made on you as a child were heavy.  And also, benefit of the doubt, maybe she was trying.  So she gets a pass for her screw-ups, but you don't get a pass for being a child who had a \"mom\" forced upon you when clearly you were not ready for something like that after your mom died?  She doesn't have any real respect for you and your brother, and you're LC with them for a reason, so why would you have this dance with her? NTA\n\nEdit to add, I'm a stepmother, so this is coming from someone in HER position.  (I mean, I've never bought myself a MD card, lol.  I'm sure she's getting ripped hard for that already here, so I'll leave that alone.)", "she cut the kid's hair against his wishes because she didn't like that it looked like their dead mother. She pushed way too much and in some insensitive ways. That wasn't a nice thing she did at all", "I think he\u2019s old enough to sit down with her to have a conversation about how they could possibly have a better relationship. People keep saying it\u2019s not the child\u2019s responsibility, but OP is no longer a child.", "On top of blaming the child for the relationship being wrong, that's just not how human relationships work.  You can't \"make yourself love someone.\"  These are usually kids going through some kind of trauma, either divorce or death, and it's just awful to blame them for the state of the eventual relationship.\n\nThere's always a bunch of idiots in the comments blaming the child of \"not giving the stepmom a chance\" or whatever.  Always wonder who those posters are.  Aggrieved stepparents, maybe.", "But she also should have never tried to force them to accept her as their mother.", "I bet they don't lol. She pushed too hard and in some insensitive ways and they don't want anything to do with her so I bet they don't ask for those things either", "she cut the kid's hair against his wishes because she didn't like that it looked like their dead mother. She was unnecessarily cruel for that", "Plus the doctors usually don't want anyone in there who isn't helpful. Traumatized teens and children aren't helpful.", "Exactly", "that's my whole point and don't get anyone that can side with her after hearing that. The haircut was insensitive and cruel", "NTA and I love that your grandpa started practicing.", "Nta", "NTA. Funny how your father didn\u2019t want be made to be something he wasn\u2019t, but he\u2019s whining and sniveling to you about you refusing to pretend to be something you aren\u2019t.", "Establish dominance.  \nAnnounce the mother/son dance and proceed to tango with your mother\u2019s ashes.  \nMaintain eye contact.  \nNTA", "NTA. You had valid reasons for not wanting a dance with your dad's wife. You chose your grandparents who have been there for you from day one when you needed them. They deserve the recognition for helping guide you in your life along with your brother's. Stay firm because this is your wedding. Your dad and his wife don't get a saying on what goes in your wedding. Wishing you the best as you celebrate the new chapters of your life.", "Seems like the step mom is the one that needs the therapy", "Nah she was the adult it was her responsibility  to control her emotions  he was the child not his fault", "They didn't even give her a chance, they just decided she was problematic from moment 1.", "Narcissists, in my experience.", "You forgot about the haircut of the brother because it reminded dad's wife of biomom too much.  That was the clincher for me.\n\nNTA.  Not even a little.", "NTA.", "I don't really have a relationship with them. Never truly did honestly.", "Alrighty, I was mostly curious if they had experienced similar behavior from her. Still probably for the best, one less possible connection to her. Keep living your life!", "The reason why I find it very hard to have compassion for this woman is because I get the impression that she cared way more about her image as a mother than her relationship to the kids. \n\nThe best mom cards, cutting the brother's hair because people were saying that he looked like his mother, wanting to go to a mother son dance, and now dancing at the wedding.... Maybe I am just projecting my own shitty experiences, but I get the impression that her ego was hurting the most, and she didn't care that much about genuine connections", "She doesn't want a relationship, she wants to performer the role of mother. Nta", "NTA\n\nif she really was trying to have some sort of relationship with you then she would have respected your decision. this day isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about YOU. she\u2019s honestly being selfish and if your feelings for her never changed during the many years she was with your dad, then that\u2019s gotta say something. that\u2019s just what i think though.", "Why would you share a Mother/Son dance with someone who isn't your mother in any meaning of the word.
