You\u2019re an AH for those \u2018clues\u2019 and hints you were dropping to your tedious cousin. Either say it outright or shut up. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t want her feeling/acting entitled because her dad inherited a few million and has investments.

You can think of it as \u201cfamily money\u201d but it belongs to individuals in the family, none of whom appear to be you.

Second, I have serious doubts about any 28 year old who is bragging about shot gunning beer.  To be honest, this entire post comes off like you feel like you're so superior to your cousin.", "Yes, YTA. For several reasons. 1.  It isn\u2019t YOUR money.  It is your parents and their siblings money.  If they want to give it to the poor there isn\u2019t a thing you can do about it. Not your place to reveal to anyone what someone else\u2019s worth is. 2. You didn\u2019t give your aunt a heads-up that she was about to have an awkward conversation.  3. You say you are close to your cousin, but you like the drama and your suppressed anger with her and 19 year olds comes through.  4.  You could have shut down the conversation when someone stirred the pot, but you like stirring pots, and you like trolling so you didn\u2019t.  Now I expect you will respond but it was all in good fun, except it wasn\u2019t because not everyone laughs at trolling.  5. At no point have you suggested that you could take her out to lunch on you soon to be 400k salary and have a conversation with her, listen to the points she has correct, and help her understand where she is uninformed.  Instead you call her a \u201cdipshit\u201d which is pretty offensive.  It dismisses everything she has accomplished, including having life experiences and taking classes you haven\u2019t had time to take yourself.  \n\nI don\u2019t see an older cousin supporting a younger one.  I see a party bro (proud of how well you can shotgun at almost 30, bruh!) who likes feeling superior to others.  If you have more knowledge you can use that as a sword to cut down, or offer it like a cup of water to quench her thirst.  You like to cut down.   I\u2019ve known a few doctors like this.  Need to feel like they are the smartest person in the room, and stop learning because they hold life in their hands and think they have it all figured out.  Wait til you get to 50.  You will think that 28 yr olds are dipshits.\n\nCome back after you spend some time with Doctors Without Borders.  I bet you have a different conversation with her then.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure exactly what offense your aunt was accusing you of. You has a conversation with your adult cousin that touched on your shared family history. If she wanted any part of it kept a secret she needed to make it clear upfront.", "NTA she should know that the educated are killed fairly early in the revolution as well. The state requires your labor not your mind comrade.", "YTA. if nothing else then for the phrase \" \"eat-the-rich\" liberal\".", "NTA, its super funny to see people come in here an have an aneurysm over someone else's pockets.", "Nta. Im surprised she hasn't figured it out. She was going to figure it out very soon and I would point that out to your aunt. Shes not a child, she's 19. It's good she learned right now before she had this blow up in her face. Like... she's got to have friends that took loans out or are worried about money. That all would have clicked with her eventually. Privileged folk should at least know they are privileged", "NTA; you didn\u2019t \u201creveal\u201d anything, you pointed out some pretty obvious clues that someone who aspires to be as socially aware as your cousin should have already picked up on.

She never had to apply for a scholarship or fasfa or have a talk about community college vs a fancy university?
