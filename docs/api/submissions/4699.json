It is your parents and their siblings money.  If they want to give it to the poor there isn\u2019t a thing you can do about it. Not your place to reveal to anyone what someone else\u2019s worth is. 2. You didn\u2019t give your aunt a heads-up that she was about to have an awkward conversation.  3. You say you are close to your cousin, but you like the drama and your suppressed anger with her and 19 year olds comes through.  4.  You could have shut down the conversation when someone stirred the pot, but you like stirring pots, and you like trolling so you didn\u2019t.  Now I expect you will respond but it was all in good fun, except it wasn\u2019t because not everyone laughs at trolling.  5. At no point have you suggested that you could take her out to lunch on you soon to be 400k salary and have a conversation with her, listen to the points she has correct, and help her understand where she is uninformed.  Instead you call her a \u201cdipshit\u201d which is pretty offensive.  It dismisses everything she has accomplished, including having life experiences and taking classes you haven\u2019t had time to take yourself.  \n\nI don\u2019t see an older cousin supporting a younger one.  I see a party bro (proud of how well you can shotgun at almost 30, bruh!) who likes feeling superior to others.  If you have more knowledge you can use that as a sword to cut down, or offer it like a cup of water to quench her thirst.  You like to cut down.   I\u2019ve known a few doctors like this.  Need to feel like they are the smartest person in the room, and stop learning because they hold life in their hands and think they have it all figured out.  Wait til you get to 50.

I\u2019m not sure exactly what offense your aunt was accusing you of. You has a conversation with your adult cousin that touched on your shared family history.
