I am by no means a perfect mother, and my husband, Tom, isn't a perfect father but we did our best all her life and tried our best to make sure she never wanted for anything. I know exactly where we went wrong as parents, and I honestly think giving her unrestricted Internet access was the problem. \n\nJane is offended by everything, and she claims a lot of things caused her trauma. One of the major things that caused her trauma, in her own words was my migraines, which I started to experience in my mid-20s. During a migraine of mine, Tom would either take Jane out for a few hours, or take her for a playdate, or to either set of grandparents. Jane claims this was traumatic because she was forced to separate from me, despite the fact she did not even know until she was in her teens. I had, at most, 5 migraines a year.\n\nJane claims me going back to work part-time when she was 15, 3 days a week while she was in school was deeply traumatic because it meant a change in her routine. That change was that dinner wasn't on the table ready for her as soon as she got in the door and she had to wait an hour. \n\nJane is unemployed. She's not in college and she does no housework, she won't even walk the dog she brought home without permission, and has decided the arguments it has caused between us all are also traumatic. She runs a tiktok account, which recently came up on my for you page, and like the terrible awful mother I am, I decided to snoop. Jane has over 10k followers, but most of the comments are genuinely making fun of her, calling her a snowflake, telling her to touch grass. She had a few videos about how she grew up below the poverty line, essentially in the ghetto, which is a complete lie because she was raised in a lower-middle class household in a pretty affluent area.\n\nA lot of her posts with the nasty comments were about me and Tom, and how much we traumatised her over the years, by being awful terrible parents. I confronted Jane pretty much as soon as I got done snooping, and she blew up saying I had no right to call her out on it. She was saying that it was going in the traumabank (not her words but pretty much what she meant). I told her if she wants trauma, she very much needs a different kind of help. \n\nI don't know what got in to me, but I ended up unplugging the WiFi router, locked it in my bedroom and spent ages on the phone to our service provider cancelling her phone contract. She's crying all day, saying it's unfair to cut her off like this. My husband things I've gone too far and that Jane will just weaponise this against us, making our lives more miserable.

I\u2019m gonna say NTA in this situation, but you are the asshole for the way you raised your daughter.", "As someone who suffers from PTSD from growing up in an abusive household, Jane is very much *not* traumatized. She is attention-seeky. All of her so-called \"traumatic\" events revolve around your attention being devoted to something other than *her*, whether that was your own suffering or your part-time job. Even her TikTok posts are her trying to get attention from her followers.\n\nBut why is she like that? Probably because, as you said yourself, you tried your best to \"make sure she never wanted for anything.\" You were very young when you had her, so I don't blame you for that, but I think it backfired. Jane appears to be incapable of going without parental attention for even a brief period of time, a skill which most children develop when they start going to preschool. I think your unwillingness to force her to get a job or go to school shows how you have enabled that. \n\nNTA. *However*, I think the two of you should talk about this in therapy and not over social media.

How are you promoting her growth by not making her take responsibility for herself?\n\nIn 10 years, do you want her still living at home / dependent on you?

Go to college and they would help as much as they can, even if it's just providing a roof while I go.

I can understand why you\u2019d be so upset after seeing her TikTok, but it does seem like things could have been handled a lot better.

At her age, it would have been good to give her a warning what you were going to do and tell her if she is not in school ,she will need to get a job and  she will need to pay rent and pay for her services she wants to use. \n\nMy daughter used to try the trauma card, but it dropped off when she starting living on her own and working and paying bills and \"adulting\" . She suddenly realized what supporting one's self is like, let alone raising a child someday.", "I\u2019m inclined to say ESH. Your daughter is clearly not behaving rationally, and wanting to take action to correct that is fine, but wholesale thinking you can cut her off from the internet with no explanation is not the way to go. It sounds like she needs therapy - whether for the alleged trauma or for the extreme attention seeking, I\u2019d rather let a therapist decide.", "NAH.\n\n\nA 20 year old should be working or going to school or doing *something*. Dunno why it seems to be trendy nowadays for young people to compare how hard they've had it but the fact that she can do nothing all day while also making videos about living in poverty just shows that she's got *issues*. \n\nYou're not wrong to be concerned and you're not wrong to want to make changes. If it were me, I'd feel a little betrayed that I could treat someone so well but then find out they lie about me online for attention.\n\n\nBut your husband isn't wrong either.

The child acts like everything is so horrible and hard for them to deal with. Their food is terrible and everyone else\u2019s is perfect. Everyone is picking on them and they are just trying to be nice. I once caught this child popping a much younger child\u2019s balloon on purpose just to upset them. When they were caught they tried to claim that they were just helping the child and they didn\u2019t mean to pop the balloon and why is everyone so mean. They then wrote a letter and how I made this story up because I secretly hate them and I\u2019m trying to ruin their life (we were all vacationing together). This child then went on an on to anyone who would listen when their dad wasn\u2019t around how he worked too much and never spent time with them and how their dad wouldn\u2019t even make them a lunch. All lies but people who didn\u2019t know the family as much ate it all up. The child loved he attention. Once they claimed a neighbor dad was super creepy and they could see him staring at girls from inside his home. Although this neighbor was social awkward I knew the allegation was false because the times the child claim to see the neighbor he was actually at work. Of course, this child has almost no friends because of their behavior towards their friends and/or the parents wise up to the behavior and forbid their child from hanging out with them. This is another opportunity for this child to go into the victimhood role. They have no friends, everyone is bullying them, they said those things because those people were hurting them.\n\nI doubt even with therapy this child would get any better. I\u2019m fact, I know this child has been in therapy for three years. They start with the I\u2019m the victim and once the therapist finally catches on\nThe child claims they are all better or the therapist just doesn\u2019t get them and they aren\u2019t a good fit. If your child is even half this therapy will not help them. \n\nHOWEVER, therapy with the right person might help you. You would have to find a person who is trained in dealing with highly manipulative people. This will just allows you to arm yourself\nTo respond to your daughter\u2019s claims if victimhood. Once manipulation no longer works on you then you can move forward. Be prepared and ready for the shift in tactic though and if you\u2019re prepared enough through therapy you can likely combat this and maybe move forward with a meaningful relationship with your daughter. \n\nI found this book really helpful In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People https://a.co/d/jiSUlD8 .
