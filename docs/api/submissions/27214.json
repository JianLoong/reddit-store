My mom coddles and enables this behaviour that happens mostly towards Alana. Harry mistreats Alana because she's much more \"quirky\", Alana is also a high-functioning autist and Harry picks on this to continue bullying her. Calling her things like \"weirdo\" \"freak\" \"stupid\" etc. My mom never minds these things and encourages it.\n\nI have tried to speak about this with my dad (43M), he is a doctor, meaning that spends much less time with us in comparasion with my mother who is a housewive. He says he'll \"Look into it\" but never does, at least of my knowing. My father is much more understanding but he prefers to remain quiet and in peace than intervene; because it could lead to make our household \"unpeaceful\" \n\nThe problem starts here; Alana and Harry started to argue since she didn't let him borrow one of her Funko Pops. Alana asked Harry to get out of her room and to please leave her alone. My mom intervened and commanded Alana to let him borrow it and to not be selfish. Idk what happened then but Alana pushed Harry out of her room ans slammed the door in both my mom and Harry faces. Later, my mom didn't shut her mouth and continued to complain about how bratty Alana was and how she never stopped to throw temper tantrums.\n\nI told my mom that it wasn't Alana's fault that she was a bad parent and continued to enable Harry bully her. Since that, my mom has been giving me the silent treatment. My father tells me that I was rude & that I shouldn't speak to my mother like that.\n\nAITA?

Your dad may be a doctor, but he is absolutely useless in this. He\u2019s a mandatory abuse reporter, yet he\u2019s allowing it to happen under his own roof.

We all commend you for sticking up for your sister. The fact that a grown ass woman, and a parent at that, would give her child the \u201csilent treatment\u201d speaks volumes (no pun intended) to your mom\u2019s lack of maturity. Always stick up for your sister. She needs to know she has someone in her corner and a safe person. Your golden-child brother will just get worse if his behavior stays unchecked. Also, your dad is culpable. Good on you for sticking up for Alana. You seem like a really awesome person.", "NTA. I'm glad you are standing up for your sister. Sounds as though she has some issues which are being aggravated by the bullying. Shame on your father for not watching out for his daughter.", "NTA.   I have to assume that male children are revered in the family and females are meant to serve.   Your father needs to get more involved.  Take note of specific things Harry has said and done and show your father the details of the abuse Harry is subjecting your sister to.\n\nYour mother is terrible.   No parent should show favouritism to one child - it pretty much guarantees that the siblings will never be close and look out for each other.", "NTA\n\nYou are a good sister for standing for Alana.

A mother who doesn't care for her 2 daughters at all.   \nYour dad is an AH too for not wanting to make the house \"unpeaceful\" It's already unpeaceful cause your sister is being bullied! Not intervening is making it worse. Choosing to not put out the fire and just standby is gonna make the fire spread. And spread it did.   \nI would say start bullying him back, and see him crumble so quick. But I don't want anything worse happening to you. The Silent Treatment sucks and is already so manipulative.   \nLike others here have said. Bring in other trustful family members into this. and even your school.

Your father is neglectful, your mother is a sexist(favoring her son) and you are a loving sister, making a plea for fair treatment and a safe home for you and your sister.\n\nCan you try once more to approach your father and tell him, as calmly as possible, that your brother bullies your sister? Perhaps don't mention your mother's failings, but ask your father to apply some measure of control over your brother, before his behavior gets him into trouble in school.\n\nIn any case, you and your sister need to band together to make plans to leave home as soon as you're both old enough and leave your absent father and abusive mother to dote on the little monster they're creating.", "NTA\n\nBut your father's fine with your mother's poor treatment of Alana?

But then I can be petty and that\u2019s just me", "Info:I\u2019d like to hear more about your mom encouraging your brothers behavior. The events described here just sound like run of the mill interactions when teens and preteens live together. Mom just ends up defending the youngest because they are the most vulnerable. It\u2019s not favoritism, it\u2019s usually just the easiest path since it is less likely that 14 and 15 year olds are being bullied by a 12 year old. Alana is an AH for slamming the door, and you\u2019re probably an AH for calling your mom a bad parent, but I\u2019m willing to be convinced otherwise.

Your mother is just the worst. Our kids are all different and sometimes have different needs and requirements but in the end, we should be seeing and treating our children as equals.  \nYour father is a huge disappointment. He certainly should know better and when you've begged for him to intervene he's ignored you and done nothing. Tell him you wouldn't have been rude if he'd listen to you and do something to stop the abuse!  \nPoor Alana is a direct victim of both your mother and your brother, and an indirect victim based on your father's disinterest in doing something to help put an end to the misery.  \nNTA in any way. You may have to keep telling her off until she gets it or your father steps up!!", "OP can tell him she'll look into it.", "OP needs to deny dad his peace until he shuts mum down. Every time Harry and mum start in on Alana, OP needs to start yelling back. Make it more trouble to him not to do something than to do it. Plus Alana will finally feel like someone is on her side. NTA keep going kiddo.", "Some video evidence would be favorite.", "You gave me a good idea that I might try. But Harry never wants to speak to me because I'm the only one who doesn't coddle him, so.

Also Alana never messes with Harry and tries to avoid him as much as she can, he's the one who keeps looking to mess with her and mistreat her only for being autistic.", "You should probably mention to that many kids in ur sisters situation end up never talking to their parents again the minute they move out and maybe that\u2019ll finally be a wake up call for your dad", " Video evidence is scary if they decide to put it on TikTok that would destroy his dad\u2019s career for sure.
