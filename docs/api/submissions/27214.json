My mom coddles and enables this behaviour that happens mostly towards Alana. Harry mistreats Alana because she's much more \"quirky\", Alana is also a high-functioning autist and Harry picks on this to continue bullying her. Calling her things like \"weirdo\" \"freak\" \"stupid\" etc. My mom never minds these things and encourages it.\n\nI have tried to speak about this with my dad (43M), he is a doctor, meaning that spends much less time with us in comparasion with my mother who is a housewive. He says he'll \"Look into it\" but never does, at least of my knowing. My father is much more understanding but he prefers to remain quiet and in peace than intervene; because it could lead to make our household \"unpeaceful\" \n\nThe problem starts here; Alana and Harry started to argue since she didn't let him borrow one of her Funko Pops. Alana asked Harry to get out of her room and to please leave her alone. My mom intervened and commanded Alana to let him borrow it and to not be selfish. Idk what happened then but Alana pushed Harry out of her room ans slammed the door in both my mom and Harry faces. Later, my mom didn't shut her mouth and continued to complain about how bratty Alana was and how she never stopped to throw temper tantrums.\n\nI told my mom that it wasn't Alana's fault that she was a bad parent and continued to enable Harry bully her. Since that, my mom has been giving me the silent treatment. My father tells me that I was rude & that I shouldn't speak to my mother like that.\n\nAITA? I could get that my mom doesn't understand very well Alana, but she also does not try to understand and comfort her. Was I too harsh?\n\nEDIT: I want to add this because I feel like this might also show just how much my mother favores Harry. Alana is a picky eater and she can't stand corn and tomatoes, or some specific vegetables. My mother and Harry know this and If Harry asks for food that contains these things my mother will do it even if she knows Alana will have a hard time eating. \n\nAlana also can't stand noises like chewing or sipping, again both Harry and my mom know this but Harry keeps chewing loud (which I find gross) and sipping loud just to trigger Alana.", "created_utc": 1695153651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16n0rx1/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_it_isnt_my/", "score": 771, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mom knows about how Alana is a picky eater and can't stand corn or tomatoes; Harry knows this too and asks mom to make food that contains corn or tomatoes. Mom complies and this makes it difficult for Alana to keep eating. There's a big, big list of things she has done.\n\n>14 and 15 year olds are being bullied by a 12 year old.\n\nHarry doesn't pick on me. He only picks on Alana. Most likely because of her autism and because he knows I'm not going to stay silent if he bothers me and Alana is much more sensible. Saying that a kid of less age can't bully one of more age is ridiculous because it can happen. Power dynamics. In our case, Harry has more power over Alana since he knows that nobody is going to scold him. Alana needs to keep silent because she knows she will be the one to be scolded if she responds.", "Love you comment!!", "Alana is being emotionally abused and made the family scapegoat.  Is there a safeguarding person at your school? Please talk to a School counselor trusted teacher or some other adult.  Some intervention might wake your father up at least. \n\nYou're a wonderful sister but you shouldn't be taking this in alone.", "Have you spoken to your grandparents about this? \n\nI've seen similar situations resolved when grandparents have stepped in.", "You\u2019re right, that\u2019s definitely her showing love. She\u2019s not just thinking of you, she\u2019s also putting work into making the little paper craft too. She may be having trouble showing vulnerability around the bullies in the house too, so that\u2019s a nice sweet quiet way of thanking you.", "I'm autistic. Alana adores you.", "Even neurotypical people have trouble voicing their emotions, especially when they are positive (we're all \"weird\" that way, I guess) so her taking the time to make those paper crafts and then gifting them to you is definitely away for her to say thank you and I love you. They mean you're being a good big sister to her.\n\nIs there a safe adult you can talk to. I think for now when ever your father asks you to apologise pf do anything, you should just say \"I'll look into it\" since it's his go to response and then decide for your self of you are going to do it, but you definitely need an adult outside of this household to speak up for you and your sister. Both of you are being let down here, not just your sister being bullied but the fact that you are considering talking to your brother about bullying and consequences  isn't fair on you because that is your parents hob not yours.", "That is remarkably precious, your sister is definitely super grateful for all of your help. Everyone needs someone in their corner, and it's a good thing you two have each other.", "I think the issue is your mom is taking it as a personal insult and failing because Alana is autistic.    So your mom is ignoring the autism.  \n\nHarry isn\u2019t perfect and I am sure there is something that Harry is sensitive about and can be exploited by Alana.   Alana will have to out bully Harry.   \n\nIs there a grandparent or aunt/uncle that sees Harry\u2019s bullying and can step in?  Or remind your mom that with how she is favoring Harry, she will only had 2 kids because Alana will go NC and if he tries to bully you when he is a teenager (he will be physically stronger than you).  She will only have 1 child.  Good luck with him taking care of her in her old age.   I suspect you come from an Asian background as am I.", "People are commenting about the school counselor thing and while it may be a good option, I'm from a third-world country and these type of things don't usually work sadly. I could try, and I'm willing to. I also could reach for some other familiars that maybe are willing to help me. I just need to know who.", "Is Harry the double whammy Golden child?  Are you living in a culture where boys are automatically favored over girls.  Meaning he is favored because he is male and the youngest?  While Alana is a \u201cworthless daughter\u201d who is also autistic? If this is the case, I would remind your mom that no one likes marrying a bully other than gold diggers.  If she wants grandchildren she needs to change how she is raising her son.", "You could show your father this post, the comments might shake him out of his complacency", "Good plan. I think I will show him tomorrow when he comes from work and perhaps he actually gets to understand more by the comments."]}
