Now, big news his dad is getting some surgery here in the states so, how ever the fuck long that is going to take, he\u2019s only now just doing the xray portion of things next week.

Yes, ok they pay for groceries, but idk how much longer I can handle the stress. I dread going home most days, just because I know they are there. I\u2019m just so stressed out, and my fianc\u00e9 knows, but he said it\u2019s his parents, he doesn\u2019t know how much time he has left with them, and he wants to spend the most time with them as he can.

This will always happen.", "NTA but it is a cultural thing to many, that you host your parents no matter what.  Personally, I am with you in the 2 week limit. And now that there's surgery and recovery?   Did your fiance KNOW this was part of the trip originally and just not tell you? \n\nIf your future spouse isn't willing to compromise with you ... is this someone you want to be married to?  This will ALWAYS happen when they come visit", "Nta. Tell bf you will go to parents house. So will your portion of rent, utilities and all other bills.", "NTA, but you\u2019re going to have to leave if you can\u2019t bear to live with them. Your fianc\u00e9 has made it clear he does not give a single sh!t how you feel about the situation or what you want. Those are his parents, he wants them there, and he *claims* he would be okay with the same situation with your parents. So in his mind, obviously, he is entitled to do what he wants and you can just deal with it. \n\nNow that you know just how much he actually cares about you and and respects your wants and needs, and how much of a say he thinks you should have in your own home, what are you going to do? Are you going to tolerate the situation, or not? If not, you do understand that your only choice is to leave, right? He suggested you go stay with your parents for a month, but my advice is that instead, you start packing up all your stuff and when the end of the month comes around, withhold your share of the next month\u2019s rent, take your things and go stay with your parents until you can find your own place to live. \n\nWhen you bf tries to make it seem that you are overreacting, or you are wrong to leave, or you should be willing to put up with having his parents there indefinitely, just tell him you see no point in discussing things with him because he obviously does not care at all what you think or what you want. He\u2019s made it clear that if you don\u2019t like it, you should move out, and that is what you are doing. Now he can live with his parents as long as he likes, without having to deal with you being unhappy about it, so there should be no problem, right?", "NTA - This just isn't acceptable in my opinion. Some will for sure think otherwise but people need their own space. Maybe they are very old and he wants to enjoy his time with them but there are other ways than HAVING THEM MOVE IN WITH YOU.", "NTA  \n\"You might know how much more time you have left with them but, I can tell you how much time you have left with me if they don't leave within 2 weeks\"", "NTA, this would be a deal breaker for me. Your partner knew they were going to stay long term and have surgery, he chose not to tell you. He doesn't respect you nor your needs. Only you can decide if you're willing to stay in this situation. Perhaps staying with your parents for a short period of time to reflect on how you want to move forward in this relationship might be helpful.  Good luck", "NTA\n\nThis is worth moving out over,preferably before you become his dad's post-op nurse.\n\nAnd reconsider your engagement because you're being shown very clearly how much your opinions,  needs and wishes will matter in the future.", "Call his bluff and go stay with your parents, and let's see if he can manage without your half of the rent and bills.", "NTA\n\nMake it: 2 more weeks, then either they are out, or you leave. \n\nYou might need to get a divorce.", "I was all ready to say N A H , until\n\n*he was like \u201cwell, why don\u2019t you just stay at your parents for a month, while I live here with my parents?\u201d*\n\nNTA - while I understand that he wants to spend as much time with his parents as possible, letting them stay indefinitely without discussing it with you is an asshole move on his part. The lack of communication is a red flag and you need to discuss this with him or maybe start looking for a place of your own.  After all his pretty much suggested it.", "NTA. Pack your stuff and leave because this will never end.", "NTA but your BF is TA.\n\n>Now, big news his dad is getting some surgery here in the states so, how ever the fuck long that is going to take, he\u2019s only now just doing the xray portion of things next week.\n\nThis is something that your BF knew about and has planned for the trip. You don't just show up on vacation and decide, ya know whilst I'm here, I'll get surgery!!\n\nSounds like the BF got one over on you.\nYou should send him to his parents house, with his parents if he wants to spend so much time with them.", "NTA - Definitely don\u2019t marry him.", "NTA Maybe ask how long they were admitted for by customs? Also time to check your apartment lease lets you have overnight guests.", "NTA\n\nBy not even being honest about the length of time his parents planned to stay - 1st major red flag\n\nDismissing your concerns - 2nd major red flag\n\nNow if he had been honest from the beginning, and you agreed, that's another matter entirely.\n\nMy wife's youngest daughter moved back in with us, she also has a son that just turned 3, the parents split custody. Originally the plan was... maybe the rest of this year, she moved in early January. And now it's likely she will be here this year and probably all of next year too.\n\nPlus my own son, moved in 2 months ago... and will probably be here for a while too....so much for being empty nesters.\n\nHowever my wife and I both agreed to help each one of the kids out, longer than expected, but it happens. I'd be a complete hypocrite if I refused, my own parents helped me out several times in my lifetime, the very least I can do is pay it forward. I know it was an inconvenience for them....\n\nBut like I mentioned, by not being honest about the length of stay and making your concerns invalid in his eyes.... is this the long term future you want... cause history will likely repeat itself.....", "NTA but guess where you are on the totem pole.", "NTA\n\nThis may be your line in the sand, because they\u2019re never going home and your fianc\u00e9 has already stated he chooses them. Anyone who tells their partner to go live elsewhere for a few months is not long term material.", "NTA... move out. There is no respect for your needs. Everyone deserves privacy in their own home and guests length of stay should be agreed upon", "NTA - but it surprises me that you two didnt talk about how Long they were going to stay before they arrived. That Way you could make other arrangements for some of the time. \n\nCan you and your fiance maybe take an open dialogue at a caf\u00e9 to understand the time duration that he honestly expects so you two Can find a solution that you both feel good about. It has to work for both of you \ud83d\ude4f \n\nGood luck!", "NTA.\n\n\"WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY AT YOUR PARENTS FOR A MONTH?\"??????\n\nGet rid of the in-laws and the husband too.  \n\n\nEDIT:  ohhhh, fianc\u00e9?  That makes it even easier.  Run.", "NTA. You will need to have a VERY serious discussion on what you expect, with your SO for your immediate future. They are seeing what you are and aren\u2019t going to tolerate. This is a huge cultural thing for central / south americans, with the whole family all living together in the same residence. Bite this in the ass now, or Id suggest you take him up on the offer and staying with your parents, obviously with the relationship probably being over by that point. I know from experience, it happened to me with my wife\u2019s family. Stand up for yourself, make yourself clear, let him make his plan clear, and from there you can see if the relationship is worth it at that point.
