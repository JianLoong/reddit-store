If my dad was sick and needed surgery, he could come live with me for as long as he needed. Even if he didn\u2019t need surgery, he could come live with me whenever but I could do the same too. I get that culturally in the US, that\u2019s a \u201cOMG how is that possible\u201d but I can\u2019t wrap my head around how would I even tell me dad that he can\u2019t stay with me. He\u2019s my dad, He made me who I am. My parents are the reason I am here. And when my parents need me, coz they are old, they are either going to come here to live with me or I am going back to live with them so they can age with dignity, surrounded by family.

I am just trying to give context, which it seems your bf is not giving. Overall I would agree with others that if this is such a big deal to you, then you probably need to think about the viability of this relationship. Coz your bf is not going to change his mind. I wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just not in me. I can\u2019t put someone else\u2019s needs over my sick dad\u2019s. It\u2019s engrained in me culturally.

Yes, there are likely cultural differences at play.\n\nBut the attitude of \"this wouldn't bother me, therefore it shouldn't bother anyone, discussion closed\" shows a significant lack of maturity and empathy. \n\nThat's not a cultural difference, it's being a shitty partner.\n\nPeople are allowed to feel differently about different situations, and then mature adults talk it out and  compromise. \n\nI don't especially enjoy having my in-laws visit, but we talk it out and set ground rules.

Rent, Own? Joint, or more 1 person than the other?\n\nIf its rented, double check you are not violating the lease.", "NAH.   You have a cultural problem, not an interpersonal one.   Families work differently in different cultures.   In the US, we expect children to grow up and found their own nuclear families, which maintain separate space.   We create rules that reinforce that separation (like, parents can't stay for more than two weeks).   Children really aren't supposed to have to support parents or care for them, that would make the parents a \"burden\" and they hate that idea.  That's fine, that's our way. \n\nBut their way is different.  People live in intergenerational households.  They are expected to help one another and pool their resources.  Demands for privacy are much lower, and parents feel perfectly entitled to be in a couple's business, because it's all one family.   If parents need to stay for a year, they stay for a year. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being wishboned by these two radically different expectations.  He feels enormous pressure from his family to live up to their social norms.  But he feels huge pressure from you to live up to yours.

Listen without judging--it's not wrong, just different.   Then listen to what he really wants to do.   What would make HIM feel best?  \n\nAt the end of that, you have to decide if you can live with it.  If you can't, bail now.  You're not compatible.

He thinks he has the right to override you and force the consequences of his decisions onto you.\nI would feel devalued, disrespected and taken advantage of, and not an equal partner.\n\nYour feelings for him may be sincere and deep, yet they don't erase your basic NEEDS for safety and security in your home and your relationship. What does your lease say about guests? Most have time limits to avoid tenants not on the lease. His parents have lived with him long enough that it might be legally required to evict them. In many states, 30 days is enough for \"long term visitors\" to have tenant's rights, even though they aren't on the lease and don't pay rent. \nHe is likely to have violated the lease as well as your trust.", "NTA. He's clearly showing you that you will never be as important as his parents. Leave him and don't look back.", "NTA.\n\nGo stay with your parents. Grab all your stuff and take it with you. Leave the ring.\n\nI get you\u2019ve put a lot of time in with him, but this seems like a sunk cost fallacy at play here. Stuff like this only gets worse over time.", "NTA\n\nCall the landlord and stitch up your fiance for moving his parents into the apartment when they're not on the lease. Get your name off the lease and move out, leave the ring behind.\n\nAt best minimum, you're culturally incompatible and marrying without agreed boundaries for your mental health is a mistake (boundaries he's not willing to set). At worst, this isn't culture it's just his family's dynamic, he's so deeply enmeshed with his family of origin that you'll never rank on his priority list and that a marriage with him will not be a joyful union but instead a miserable endurance that will only end with you waking up eventually, might as well let this incident be the one that opens your eyes, don't waste any more of your life.", "> **I responded with \u201cmax I would let my parents stay two weeks, I would go crazy\u201d and he was like \u201cwell, why don\u2019t you just stay at your parents for a month**\n\nShe said she couldn't live with her parents for more than **2 weeks** and he suggested that she stay with them for a **month**? I think this man has a auditory processing issue!", "NTA You don\u2019t have in-laws just yet they are his family and right now he is showing you the pecking order in his life.  But you share some responsibility in this situation for not discussing this prior to them moving in.\nNeed to re-evaluate your relationship", "NTA. leave and let him spend all the time he wants with his parents. \n\nIt's inconsiderate of him and his parents.", "I looked up OP's post history and OP definitely needs to not marry him. He expects his parents to stay with them on their wedding night and he originally got a ring, know it wasn't OP's taste, because he had a specific date he wanted to propose on. He comes off as very \"my way or the highway.\" That is not a healthy way to exist in a relationship", "This sounds like a difference in cultures. And, it is probably best that these two realize that they aren't culturally compatable before they say \"I do.\"\n\nI'm wondering what the conversation/agreement was before the parents' came to visit. For many people, it is normal that parents stay with their kids for extended periods, especially if their trip from their home country is long and expensive. And, in this case, it sounds like the trip was partially due to health reasons..... \n\nThis is the norm for many and an unspoken understanding. For many others, it is not. If this isn't what OP is OK with, it may be best to go on their separate ways. It sounds like they have two very different ideas about family/boundaries.", "That line sounded like a breakup to me.", "I bet bf would still expect her to contribute her \u201cportion\u201d since she\u2019s choosing to leave. People who immediately jump to \u201cjust go\u201d are usually outraged when said person does that and takes their money with them.", "Absolutely agree with wondering what the conversation/agreement was preceding the visit. I normally dislike when cultural differences are used in judgements on posts about partners. Sure, people have all sorts of cultural differences, but surely you'd still discuss things with your partner and get the go ahead? And if it is something that doesn't occur to you as something that's a cultural difference, then when it's pointed out like this, you then discuss it right? You don't just dismiss it like OP's partner did.\n\nWhatever the cultural differences, you're still supposed to care about your partner I would think? (Question marks not directed at you Electrical Date, just marking my lack of conviction/openness to correction)", "2 weeks makes it a discussion  - \"right now\" is not a discussion but an immediate breakup.", "If you still want to try with your dance, despite everything so far (you posted months ago about hating the engagement ring he got you, then about him wanting to have your ILs drive you home and stay with you on your wedding night and them having another son who lives in q mansion an hour away from you) I would tell him to send his parents to their other kid for at least the same amount of time. If he doesn't want to do that, you need to just give him the ring back. He can sell it to pay your portion of the rent and stuff because that would be strike 3.", "Please dont marry him. He lacks respect towards you", "I mean neither of you are assholes - just incompatible. Reasonable for him to want them to stay and reasonable for you to want them to leave (I\u2019m with you that it would be too much for me too )", "NAH\n\nIt seems you guys didn\u2019t get the different expectations or the family dynamics discussed prior to living together or getting engaged??\n\nSeems like you both need to sit down and have a chat.", "YTA", "NTA\nIf the place isn't in your name, follow his suggestion and leave. Get some distance and then decide what to do", "NTA, having guests for this long is probably also not allowed in your lease", "They clearly come from different cultural backgrounds. Because in my country this would totally be acceptable.", "Yep it was planned and the comment of \"they can stay for a year\" means that's how long they expect to be there. X rays, consultation, any pre op care, surgery, post op recovery, post op rehabilitation. Depending on what he's there for, they could easily be staying a year and if there were complications then longer.", "I wonder how long it would take him to even notice that she wasn't coming back. I'm afraid it could be the whole year. \"Okay honey. You can come home now.\" \"Uhhh... I left you 8 months ago.\"", "True, but he already expressed his intention and told it's going to be over a month and she shall leave the house for that time. He rejected her request."]}
