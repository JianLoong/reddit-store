Inquired with the vendors and got the paperwork to cancel should he have agreed. There would have been no point in asking to change the plans if we would lose our deposits.  I felt this way we knew what we were working with. \n\nAdditionally I tried to talk to him for 2 days about not wanting our wedding like my brothers and he blew off discussing since it's \"already planned\".", "created_utc": 1686838513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a3jww/aitah_for_attempting_to_cancel_our_wedding_prior/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don\u2019t understand why what you did was wrong, you have no business getting married. Obviously your fianc\u00e9 wants to have the big wedding so you need to compromise.

I get the anxiety but you went about it all wrong and how YOU wanted.  This is where you are an AH, \"make this choice on my own but I thought he understood how I felt?\".

The issue is that you didn't talk to him before making the decision, or get on the same page with him at least, and that's why he is likely hurt by your actions. \n\nI notice you're trying to backtrack and justify your reasons, but the point still stands: you went ahead with a decision without agreement with the person you're supposed to be marrying.

It is NOT OK to get overwhelmed and start canceling things without talking to your partner.", "YTA for cancelling without talking to your future spouse. Does not bode well for your future together if you think you can cancel important events without even asking his view first.  yup that is selfish.

If I were your fianc\u00e9, I\u2019d take this as a sign of incompatibility and impulsiveness. Also you drank yourself through your brothers wedding? Why? Do you always need to do this at large events? Your explanations in other comments make no sense.maybe ask yourself if you want to get married at all?

You expect him to read your mind and be sympathetic to your feelings but completely disregard his.  If this was me, I would see it as a red flag. What else are you capable of doing because you only took your feelings into consideration. Making calls is reactive. Being happy major decisions were changed over your feelings is completely insular and a bit self-centered. No compromise was discussed.  I completely understand social anxiety. I own a t-shirt, but it doesn't prevent you from including your partners wishes. You could have easily hoped to reach a compromise. Despite this new age mentality, it's the brides' day, it really isn't. Though the bride is showcased and most of her desires are taking into consideration the groom, should never feel like he's just supposed to show up and be the bride's pedestal. \nEdit: I know you're doubling down on your ah-ish behavior.

But not ***once*** would either of us ever call **behind each other\u2019s*** back to cancel the wedding. \n\nIt does **not** matter that all you got was paperwork. The fact you even did that ***is the problem***. You just showed you\u2019re future husband that you are selfish, irresponsible, insecure, and poor with finances. Once you have so much money into - you have to do it (unless there\u2019s a serious issue such as cheating). You get almost *no* money back so now you\u2019d be out a couple grand. You should have had a genuine hard conversation and self introspection prior to signing **any** contracts. \n\nOmfg.", "They didn't cancel anything though, they only made an inquiry to see what their options were. She also did talk to her partner, she mentions it after talking about the financial stress this wedding has caused them both. Clearly stating that it had been especially stressful for him. \n\nShe hasn't done anything wrong here. The part about her brother's wedding was a little cringe, some rom com type nonsense, but that's really it. \n\nI understand that you may have commented before the edit, but even then she never stated that she implicitly cancelled anything. \n\nYou made a really bold assumption, without taking in all the details. YTA.", "This exactly! All I read was me, me, I, I, I. Nothing about what the fianc\u00e9 wanted. What if he wants this kind of wedding? He\u2019s supposed to just accept OP decided she wants to cancel what he might be invested in planning? No discussion about alternatives or how to make the wedding not the large spectacle she doesn\u2019t want, but maybe find a compromise. \n\nJfc, OP, get a clue. Granted you are the bride, but believe or not the wedding is not ONLY about you. It\u2019s about BOTH of you. \n\nYTA!", "Did you in fact read the whole update? She didn't actually cancel anything. She inquired with the vendors about cancellation, refunds, alternatives in the event refunds were not possible, but she did not actually cancel. So part of your Y T A is based on false presumptions. And if she cannot handle the spotlight of a large wedding she shouldn't have one, AND if this is a dealbreaker for her fiance then they shouldn't be marrying each other.", "She didn\u2019t cancel anything, read the update", "I believe you may have looked past a few redflags in search of this 'he blew you off' thing you're talking about...", "I\u2019m just going to assume you meant wouldn\u2019t", "She wasn't \"blown off\", she just got the answer she didn't want, so she went ahead and did it anyway.", "Consent means anyone in the party can change their mind at any time! OP may have not gone about it the best possible way but they are still totally justified in wanting to cancel.", "Well, I don't know how you could have drawn *more* attention to yourself than by getting blind drunk and making yourself sick at someone else's wedding.\n\nBefore all that, you were just a bridesmaid.\n\nYTA", "This is not normal behavior at all\u2026", "You brought up a good point.  Getting puke faced drunk at this wedding, while she\u2019s mentioned all the other \u2018family\u2019 weddings that she\u2019s attended, and not stating being drunk at those weddings, to me means she and her fianc\u00e9 are doomed.  You don\u2019t cancel a wedding without a mutually agreed to plan\u2026.after a thorough discussion.  That\u2019s going to be one expensive party before a divorce.", "There is harm if she doesn\u2019t tell her fianc\u00e9 she\u2019s doing it first. It isn\u2019t just her wedding and if OP\u2019s old enough to get married, she\u2019s old enough to have an adult conversation about her fears.", "I've held quite a few women's hair while they were throwing up. Didn't know that was a sign that we were going to have a small wedding instead. I'm kinda worried about how their bfs will take the news", "Yup, I read it. Changes nothing. Her fianc\u00e9 said he did not want to cancel the wedding\u2026so she made a bunch of calls about canceling the wedding and then called him and said \u2018good news! We can cancel the wedding!\u2019", "It was sarcastic", "This sort of thing can really be situational. I empathize with OP because, while I can (and have) given presentations in front of, literally, hundreds of people (public speaking is not one of my fears), I HATE HATE HATE to eat in front of people. That's why, at my own wedding, we didn't have a \"head table\" or a \"sweetheart table\" - we had a round table set alongside every other round table at the reception, so it was a lot like eating at a restaurant, except I had the fanciest outfit. \n\nI do agree that OP should take a deep breath, give it a few days, and try to unpack exactly what it was that caused her to panic, because this does sound a lot like a panic attack. And anyone who's condemning OP for that hasn't had a true panic attack, because a true panic attack really takes over - it's hard to even breathe.", "She didn't cancel. She inquired about cancellation. There's a world of difference between considering an action and looking into it, and actually taking that action. OP did the former, so she's not an A H yet, although she could have discussed it with her fiance before making the inquiries, or approached the conversation with him differently. \n\nIf OP is THIS anxious about taking one of the two lead roles in a formal production (which is what a large, fancy wedding really is), then she shouldn't do it. If it's a dealbreaker for her fiance then maybe they shouldn't be getting married. Because insisting that a partner go through with something that stresses them to the point of self-medication, but is not strictly necessary, simply for the social niceties, isn't something a loving partner would do. Likewise, a loving partner would have the conversation about this before making any unilateral decisions.\n\nNAH, solely because OP didn't actually cancel anything, but these two need to have a serious conversation about who they are, what matters to them, and whether they really are compatible as a team going forward. Because if a person is only willing to marry if the wedding is a wedding THEY would enjoy regardless of their partner's needs/preferences (and this goes both ways), then maybe they should not be marrying each other.", "So her wants just get ignored? She came to him with the full facts having checked them. But she has to go through with a big wedding as that's what the partner and her family want. Where's the compromise?", "She didn\u2019t \u2018come to him with the full facts\u2019 to have a balanced conversation about their options. She said \u2018great news, we get to cancel the whole wedding we\u2019d previously agreed to! Why aren\u2019t you thrilled?\u2019\n\nBut also yeah, the time to say you don\u2019t want a big wedding is before you plan a big wedding. You don\u2019t get to insist on canceling the whole thing on a whim.", "Nobody said that. The problem is she\u2019s not communicating or compromising. She decided on a whim what would be best for her and disregarded the idea of her fianc\u00e9 having wants and needs in regards to their wedding. Especially when it was already something trust was committed to and agreed upon."]}
