Inquired with the vendors and got the paperwork to cancel should he have agreed. There would have been no point in asking to change the plans if we would lose our deposits.

If you don\u2019t understand why what you did was wrong, you have no business getting married. Obviously your fianc\u00e9 wants to have the big wedding so you need to compromise.

The issue is that you didn't talk to him before making the decision, or get on the same page with him at least, and that's why he is likely hurt by your actions. \n\nI notice you're trying to backtrack and justify your reasons, but the point still stands: you went ahead with a decision without agreement with the person you're supposed to be marrying.

It is NOT OK to get overwhelmed and start canceling things without talking to your partner.", "YTA for cancelling without talking to your future spouse. Does not bode well for your future together if you think you can cancel important events without even asking his view first.  yup that is selfish.

If I were your fianc\u00e9, I\u2019d take this as a sign of incompatibility and impulsiveness. Also you drank yourself through your brothers wedding? Why? Do you always need to do this at large events? Your explanations in other comments make no sense.maybe ask yourself if you want to get married at all?

You expect him to read your mind and be sympathetic to your feelings but completely disregard his.  If this was me, I would see it as a red flag. What else are you capable of doing because you only took your feelings into consideration. Making calls is reactive. Being happy major decisions were changed over your feelings is completely insular and a bit self-centered. No compromise was discussed.  I completely understand social anxiety. I own a t-shirt, but it doesn't prevent you from including your partners wishes. You could have easily hoped to reach a compromise. Despite this new age mentality, it's the brides' day, it really isn't. Though the bride is showcased and most of her desires are taking into consideration the groom, should never feel like he's just supposed to show up and be the bride's pedestal. \nEdit: I know you're doubling down on your ah-ish behavior.

The most stressful part about a wedding is the vows (if you choose to write/read your own).. everything else happens in a blink of an eye.  \nIf you have gone to all these other weddings, how on earth did you just now realize the center of attention is just on you two?.. it is literally for y'all. \n\nIf I was the fiance, I'd be super worried/upset that you would just go and start trying to cancel things, without talking about it. He has every right to be upset. If it makes you so anxious you should probably visit a therapist to help you. You still could cancel, but you need to talk that through with future hubby and see if he is okay with it, if he still wants to be future hubby. \n\nYTA. Communicate and get help. Pro tip, alcohol isn't going to help.", "ESH based on your updates. You do need to have the conversations about what will be acceptable to both of you.", "N T A for not wanting a traditional wedding with lots of people. However, YTA for making a unilateral decision without consulting your fianc\u00e9. You took something that was about y\u2019all and basically showed your fianc\u00e9 that only your opinion matters. \n\nIf I was your fianc\u00e9, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be upset that you didn\u2019t want to have a wedding (although he may really want that and be upset you don\u2019t), I would be upset that you just decided to start the cancellation process without even discussing it with me. This would make me wonder how this is how all big decisions will go\u2026you make the decision and never consult my thoughts.", "NTA because you didn\u2019t actually cancel anything, you just looked into whether it was possible to do so.\n\nHonestly, you wouldn\u2019t even be TA if you had cancelled anything. You have a right to bodily autonomy and you\u2019re not obligated to go through with something just because other people want you to. (People on this sub really need to refresh themselves on the concept of consent, and understand that it doesn\u2019t just apply to sexual stuff!)", "I wanted a courthouse wedding but husband wanted a church wedding.  (I am pagan btw) Guess what,  we got married in a church but did something! Wanted to do on honeymoon!", "NTA your fiance got very upset", "ESH - Looking at your addendum, you tried to speak to him prior to starting the cancellation process.  This should have been a joint decision - that part is on you big time. It looks as if you are not on the same page, and his reaction was less than ideal.  I would suggest some joint counseling ASAP, plus some individual therapy for yourself. Good luck.", "You're probably getting this grief as a result of how you went about it.  The toothpaste is out now.  Going to have to just roll with the consequences.", "Yta. Your a walking red flag. Don\u2019t be surprise if this causes a divide in your relationship", "YTA huge red flag you thru up for him. Can't imagine marrying someone who attempts to unilaterally make massive financial decisions without even talking to their partner first. Dudes probably rethinking the marriage.", "NTA. You didn't actually cancel anything you just made inquiries about the feasibility of doing so so I'm going to give you a slim pass though you should have told him you planned to do so and his response to a situation that is clearly causing you a great deal of distress kind of sucks ass.", "NTA.  If you don't want to get married as planned,  don't.  Should you have voiced your concerns to fiance? Yes.  \n\nDon't let others push you around on this.   And if fiance, doesn't like it, give the ring back and take your time.", "Never gotten drunk to cope before. \n\nIt was over 200 people wedding and being asked to not only stand in the wedding party but reception duties and eating infront of that many people did me in. \n\nI'm fine in crowds, love concerts but I'm not  a part of the attention for them. Fine with public speaking when I have to which is why I thought getting married wouldn't be an issue.", "This, one million percent. The fact that you just dropped this on him like it\u2019s great news. You don\u2019t seem to care about his feeling at all and don\u2019t even sound mature enough to get married.", "OP sounds incredibly self centered.  First she decides to \"drink herself\" through her brothers wedding, getting so sloppy drunk that she's puking and her partner has to take care of her. Then she decides that whatever she wants for the wedding is what matters, and doesn't even talk to him about it? \n\nThe only decent thing she did was show her true colours before the big day. Her fiance still has a chance to cut his losses and RUN.", "So much this. I wanted a court house wedding, my hubby wanted a big wedding. We compromised and had a small wedding at his parents church. It at the very least needed to be a conversation between them before she just decided to say fuck it.", "She didn't cancel anything, she just looked into the possibility of canceling it.", "I disagree, based on the fact that she didn\u2019t cancel, she inquired what her options are. There is no harm in finding out if it\u2019s even a possibility, and what, if any, the repercussions are. That\u2019s actually a mature track to take. \n\nHer social anxiety was so bad that she self medicated to the point of illness. That\u2019s a real thing that needs to be addressed. Whether it\u2019s going to a psychiatrist to see if anxiety meds are needed, or simply having a conversation with her soon-to-be life partner about what would be best for both of them. OP doesn\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d anyone a wedding at the cost of her well-being. \n\nOP: If your partner wants to put everyone else above your needs for a party, you really need to sit with those feelings. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s just seeing this as an absolute obligation because of plans set into place, so he can\u2019t fathom telling everyone that plans are changing. You both need to get in the same page without feeling like one or the other is winning or losing. Maybe find a compromise? Perhaps you\u2019d rather just a small, intimate ceremony or courthouse thing, then a small reception or something like renting a room at a restaurant with a dinner? \n\nI think it\u2019s NAH, but really depending on whether compromise is possible.", "Pretty sure OP is assuming his support of her via hair holding constitutes support of her drunken hysterics.", "I made this post prior but the sub was down for submitting. \n\nI posted in the elopement group looking for suggestions after, but things are still a bit tense so I did want to see what this post brought for insight.  \n\nHe is open to eloping but not as much as I had orginally thought when I posted we both wanted out of the wedding.", "Haven't canceled... inquired if canceling was possible", "> NTA. Had you actually cancelled, I'd have said Y T A but if I'm reading this correctly at this stage you've simply made enquiries.\n\nI think OP intentionally backtracked because the edit does say that she just asked if she could cancel, but before the edit, she makes it sound like she was so happy to cancel and that she thought she was doing what he would have also wanted, which makes it sound like OP was absolutely going to cancel had she not needed her fiance's signature or permission (or if he had readily agreed when she brought the papers).\n\nOP also backtracks on talking to her fiance as well. She edits in that she DID talk to him but he blew her off, when the original post made it seem like she didn't consult him on the matter.\n\nWhich makes it hard because we don't know if OP accidentally left this info out originally or if she backtracked to make the situation not as bad after getting YTA verdicts. I personally think the latter, as a couple things in her edit contradict what she originally said.", "So what her fiance wants doesn't matter at all then it's just her day? She needs to grow up and learn to communicate with her partner first before just jumping the gun. Being told the way that he was would upset anyone. I'm sure there's a compromise that could be reached but she was only thinking about herself.", "You don't think she should have at least told him she wants to cancel? Like a simple \"hey I want to cancel our wedding\". And besides \"you don't want a wedding don't have one\" what about what her fianc\u00e9 wants? Does he not get a say?", "So a person who got upset about his fianc\u00e9e who went behind his back, made bunch of calls in order to cancel wedding and sent cancelation form without talking to him first is a bit of an AH but an actual person who planned to cancel wedding behind her fianc\u00e8s back is not?\n\nI cannot fathom this.... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So you don't think she should have at least tell her fianc\u00e9 \"hey I'm about to cancel OUR wedding, you ok with that?\"", "Except OP didn't talk to her fiance before all of this. Yes, consent matters. It also goes both ways. She should have talked to him first. She should not have unilaterally made a decision that affected both of them. \n\nIt's not about her changing her mind. She is well entitled to do that and decide for a smaller wedding or elopement. But, as the title even says, she \"attempted to cancel\" which means she was NOT inquiring first, she was actually going to cancel if she could. She attempted to cancel and failed. She didn't \"ask about cancellation\"; I think she changed her story in her edit. \n\nWhich, again, the issue is not her wanting to cancel because she realized a large wedding wasn't for her. The issue is her not talking to her fiance and making sure he was on board or figuring something out prior to attempting to cancel.", "Ofc he did. She cancelled behind his back. In which world is that ok?", "No shit. Who wouldn't be upset when their SO out of the blue goes around canceling wedding you both prepared for behind your back?", "Please seek therapy. The fact that this doesn\u2019t normally happen makes me think that something deeper caused it.", "So I'm confused about how you are happy speaking in front of large crowds, but driven to panic by eating in front of them. But panic attacks, when they come, usually aren't rational.\n\nAnd that's what this sounds like. It sounds like you had a completely unexpected panic attack, based on some strange irrational fear. That's something you can work on. Canceling your wedding plans looks like a kneejerk panic response. \n\nFirst, take a breath and pause.\n\nThen go through and analyze what about the event made you panic, and how it differed from those public speaking occasions where you were fine. Yes, if you're the bride, you will be the center of attention at your wedding. But no more so than if you're speaking in public, and you're on a stage in front of hundreds of people. And when you're speaking in public, you're on your own. At a wedding, you get to have your new husband with you, so you don't have to do it alone.\n\nIf you really decide you can't cope, then you can talk about it, but I think you're doing all this in a kneejerk panic, and that doesn't serve you well.", "How noticeably wasted were you at your brother's wedding? It just seems like you have a terminal case of Main Character Syndrom, where nothing but what you want and you feel matters. If you caused your  brother embarrassment by getting sloppy drunk at his wedding, then decide that your wedding is getting canceled without even talking to your partner, that seems so very self-centered.", "Nobody here knows anything about your life. Financially, weddings are a waste of money. I've been with my \"wife\" for 20 years but we never got married. Our friends were dropping between 12 and 50 thousand dollars and going into debt. None of them are religious.\n\nYou're not an asshole. You got information from the venue. You just need to sit down and explain how you're feeling to your husband. Throwing a ton of financial stress on top of a relationship is a terrible idea. Tell him you love him but you're stressing out about the financials and the expectations of your family.\n\nFigure things out with your husband. Don't do anything to please others, do what makes sense for you and your husband. House, cottage, vehicles, kids, travel, hobbies all come way before a wedding in my opinion. I doubt I'll ever get married but if I do, it'll be just signing the papers with one witness and then a big party on my property. Never do what's not best for you. Take care.", "If I were engaged and my partner told me they were cancelling our wedding, I would automatically assume they don\u2019t want to marry me at all\u2026 The lack of forethought here for her partner\u2019s feelings\u2026 YTA", "Ah okay.\n\nSo he is still mad but open to elopement? \n\nBut yea, I can understand why he is mad as losing money sucks. Can you downgrade the wedding and have less people there? Would that make you more comfortable.\n\n\nBut still YTA as you two do need to be on the same page prior to make calls and making decisions. You can't assume he will be okay with something", "I scrolled through some of your comment history. If I can just offer this one piece of advice: go to therapy. You seem to have quite a bit of insecurities that you need to address before you sign a legally binding contact (marriage certificate). You need to be sure. It\u2019s actually super easy to get married, but very very difficult to get unmarried. I\u2019m years into a divorce, and just want to be done, but it\u2019s not that simple of the person you\u2019re married to wants to drag it out. DO NOT get married if you\u2019re not sure, if you\u2019re having doubts, if you\u2019re having insecurities- you need to address them first. You do not owe anyone anything at the expense of your well-being. And, anyone who truly has your best interests in mind will not only understand, but will support you. Therapy and surrounding myself with the right people served me so, so well. Best of luck.", "Point still stands. Don't just jump off the handle and get things moving, especially without considering other consequences. For what it's worth, I don't disagree with you not wanting a larger wedding and at the end of the day it's your choice. I'd also ask every bride whose wedding you've been to what the day was like for them. As a groom, I had a lot of crap to deal with but once things started rolling I had very little time to think (barely any to eat) so while memorable it just flew on by.", "It is still a conversation you have with partner first. Don't let him blow you off. Something for you to consider, before you go forward, have you always had issues with anxiety. Could this be a one off?", "If OP cancelled or was planning to cancel without speaking to their fiance, it's an easy YTA for me. My reading was that they had to sign a form to cancel, which they had not done, and as OP assumed the fiance would see it as good news, that they didn't plan on going behind their back.", "I guess, for me, the conversation needed to be not just had but agreed upon BEFORE OP approached the vendor and photographer and other people. Because OP said that her fianc\u00e9 even said no prior, it means there was no agreement. So, at least it sounds like OP either didn't talk to the fianc\u00e9 (as in her original post) or she did talk to him but he said no and she did it anyway (implied in her edit).\n\nEither option makes her an asshole for me."]}
