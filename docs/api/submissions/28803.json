There were few enough people coming that the couple decided to switch to a destination wedding in Hawaii and pay their guests travel & lodging costs.  Suddenly the SIL (and her family of 5) changed their mind about attending the wedding and wanted the free trip.  \n\nIf SIL's events end up eroding your guest list substantially, maybe upgrade your event for the ones who do choose to attend.", "It doesn't matter that you're already legally married. You planned a celebration to include your family in your joy. SIL made a request that the date be changed, and you were kind enough to accommodate her because you wanted her to be a part of that celebration. Now, after things have been decided, she has made a decision that will potentially deprive you of the company of people you wanted there, and that hurts. It feels, if not an intentional slight, at least inconsiderate on her part.\n\nNTA, and all of the YTA responses confuse me. This has nothing to do with who's already married, and everything to do with giving basic courtesy where it's due. But I don't think uninviting SIL is the right move here. You've told her you won't be able to make her wedding, which she seems okay with, but you haven't told her that you feel hurt by the lack of respect she's showing by making the schedule impossible for you, when you made it work for her. \n\nOf course she's entitled to whatever date she wants, and if that's her priority you've already made your decision not to attend her wedding. But before you burn this bridge, have a heart-to-heart and share your feelings. Maybe the two of you will find another solution. Or maybe she'll reveal she did it on purpose and you can uninvite her with impunity. Or any number of possibilities in between. So many of these posts are matters of poor communication; don't let that darken a day you've been planning for years.", "Jesus. No one is the asshole. These comments suck. \n\nYes, it is totally okay to be upset about how close her wedding is to yours, especially because you planned yours first.  People don\u2019t realize this, but loads of people in your family may have to choose which wedding they attend now. For some, travel and work schedules make it hard to go to both. This exact scenario happened to me, but my SIL planned hers for 2 months after mine. People chose to go to hers because it was at a resort, causing many folks to cancel their plans to come to ours. It sucked having so many people tell me they\u2019d rather go to hers than ours. And that\u2019s what happens. \n\nOn the other hand, she is allowed to pick whatever day she wants. It\u2019s inconsiderate to choose a date so close to yours, but this is one of those things where if you make a big deal out of it you look jealous, so you have no choice but to deal with it.", "NTA. NO ONE should ask someone to move a wedding for their own personal needs. The fact you did and now she wants you to do it again? Lame - SIL seems incredibly self centered. In terms of you already eloping, who cares? If your plan was to get married and then do a big wedding later, then live your best life and do what\u2019s best for YOU and your partner, not anyone else. Honestly I\u2019d make your wedding the same day as her doctorate now \ud83d\ude02", "NTA although it should be a decision that you and your wife make because it's her sister, not yours.\n\n\nI can completely see why you'd be upset, you moved your celebration an entire year just to accommodate her graduation and then the year rolls around and suddenly she Has to get married right near the date you chose? She's got big \"main character energy\" as the Reddit kids say and has little to no respect for your wife. \n\n\nI'd be interested to know if your wife has always been in the shadow of her sister and if this kind of thing is common. \n\n\nTbh I'm surprised at all the YTA comments that insist because you two had to elope that your actual celebration is no longer important. It is, and I hope you get to have one you both enjoy. Congratulations", "NTA. SiL has now stepped on your wedding *twice*. That's rude.", "NTA \n\nI guess I wouldn\u2019t go as far to disinvite her. But you\u2019ve moved this event for her once and she doesn\u2019t even care that you guys can\u2019t attend her wedding.. that\u2019s kinda messed up. But I\u2019m not sure I would want her at my wedding either.", "NTA for being upset about it, that was a dick move by SIL, but I guess kinda TA for trying to block SIL from your wedding when your partner is okay with it?", "NTA. Lots of cultures have a legal civil ceremony and then separately hold a symbolic family and friends celebration. It sounds like the OP and partner would have had the celebration much closer to the legal ceremony but they put it off for a YEAR to satisfy SIL's request and not rain on her parade. Now SIL's thanks is doing something that deliberately means the pair won't be able to attend themselves and other family members have to choose between them. Maybe SIL doesn't consider her sister's marriage as real as her own because it's two women and that makes it OK to trample on them. In any case SIL is AH. Whether OP and wife want to deal with the family drama that will inevitably ensue if they don't include her is another question. On the other hand, seems like with this SIL there is going to be family drama in any case.", "I don't get all the YTa votes because you're not. Your sil sure is tho! All you can do is hope for the best at this point. NTA", "NTA", "Nta , U have a right to be angry but at the end of the day Ur finances sister not attending the wedding isn't gonna do anything but create problems between them . So I say just be more cautious of her in the future", "YTA.  You're already married.  Stop trying to be the main character in everyone's life.", "NTA. But you go LC with sil. Looking at scenario now it seems like your wife is fine with everything so disinviting sil will cause drama and maybe affect your relationship with your wife. So not worth it.waht sil is doing is so wrong. Pls don't do anything to affect your relationship", "YTA. You're already married.", "YTA because it is lowering yourself,  and that action could cause you to lose guests if their family find our about your retaliation. \n\nPersonally I would move the wedding back to next year if you can,  better to clash with the graduation than the wedding especially if SIL doesn't care of you can't make her wedding then you don't need to accomodate her for yours?", "NTA. I don\u2019t get all these Y T A comments. Yeah, you\u2019re already married but that doesn\u2019t change the fact you had this planned well in advance of your SIL. Plus, the fact you pushed yours out by a year to accommodate her only to get a slap in the face by her plans solidifies the fact you\u2019re completely right to feel this way.", "ESH. And I say this as a soft ESH. You have every right to be upset and she has every right to plan her wedding around the same time. It sucks, it truly does, but to kick her out over it is not a good enough reason and comes off as retaliatory. This is similar to what my fianc\u00e9 and I are dealing with. My fianc\u00e9s cousin had their wedding delayed because of the pandemic and had to reschedule. The day they chose to reschedule it to? Mine and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding date that\u2019s coming up next week. Understandably, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin is upset that the family is choosing to go to our wedding over theirs (since they were planning by 2020), but we secured the date in before them and had save the dates out before their announcement of the reschedule. What did they do? Kick out some of the family from their wedding that we had invited to ours as retaliation. It\u2019s a frustrating situation you\u2019re in OP, but do what you can without making things even more stressful. Stick to your guns of what you\u2019re planning to do and let your SIL know that you\u2019re not gonna accommodate anything else. If more people want to go to her wedding over yours, think of it positively that you won\u2019t have to spend as much money on shit. I\u2019m wishing you guys the best and congrats everything!", "you're the asshole, for pushing a wedding because someone had a graduation in the same week. If anything a graduation in the same week means the SIL could have more family in town to celebrate for her night because more people would be in town for the wedding. why on earth push it for that or for her, and yes, her putting her wedding a month ahead of yours so people can't afford or take time off to do both is a seemingly pretty deliberate act.\n\nI'd say at a gathering of family in front of a bunch of people that it would be nice if she pushed her wedding up or later the same way you moved your entire wedding a year just for her graduation, make it very clear that you accommodated her massively, make her say no and look unreasonable in front of everyone. Does seem kind of deliberate and petty from her.\n\nNTA.", "Good grief!  Just invite everyone and, if they can't attend, try to be understanding.  YTA.", "YTA. I can see why you're hurt but translating that hurt into not wanting the SIL at your wedding is childish.", "YTA I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re already married. Fair enough you tried accommodate her by changing the date etc but at the end of the day you\u2019re married already", "YTA this doesnt sound fair. It sounds controlling and immature.\n\nDo you really want to offend her to the point of NC over a date? You are already married!", "NTA", "YTA. Her wedding is more than a month ahead of yours? That\u2019s absolutely fine.\n\nYou have plenty of advance notice to work out the time off issue. \n\nYour partner gets a say too, right? Right?\n\nI see where you\u2019re coming from though, enjoy your wedding.", "YTA. She's your partner's sister, not yours. If your partner doesn't mind, you don't get to demand SIL doesn't attend. It would be different if SIL had said or done something truly hurtful to you, but she hasn't. She's just been living her life and making her own plans.", "NTA.\n\nYou already accommodated them, now they pull this?\n\nNot cool.", "YTA\n\nSounds like you will have been married for two years at the time of your not wedding. The most you could call it is a vow renewal.\n\nCan't blame people for not prioritizing a vow renewal over an actual wedding.", "YTA, sil is very inconsiderate for her planning but actually uninviting her, especially when your wife (her sister!) wants her there and doesnt feel its a big deal, is assholery.", "YTA - you are already married. Your wedding already happened. She is in fact getting married about 2 years after your wedding if I\u2019m reading your post correctly.   \n\nHow many more years are you going to drag this out for?", "Wait, aren\u2019t you already married? SIL isn\u2019t married. Hers will be a real wedding. Yours is a historical re-enactment/celebration. What would you have her do? Postpone her real wedding for a year to make it convenient for everyone? Your wife is right. Get on with your life already. Enjoy both your celebration and her wedding with the people who are there.", "YTA Why do people love drama in their life I just don't get it. and it's good to see it's only about what you want at the wedding.", "YTA. your already married. You want to have a party on the same day as your anniversary.   Either move the party date or get over the fact that not everyone will be able to go to your party", "You already knew she thought she world revolved around her when she asked you to push your wedding. She doesn't care about your stuff anywhere near as much as she cares about her own stuff and that's just how it is. If you don't attend her wedding, she doesn't have to attend yours. But you're not the only one getting married. So talk it out with your husband and see what he thinks. You had it right the first time, when you eloped. \n\nNTA.", "SIL can only do one wedding. So the problem is\u2026what?", "NTA I'd be pissed", "YTA. The choice to accommodate SIL was yours and your partners, so don\u2019t blame her. She asked, you said yes.  Move on. \n\nDon\u2019t go to her wedding if you can\u2019t afford it. SIL is fine with it. Why create drama for no reason? \n\nNot everyone invited will RSVP yes. This is the case for all weddings. Enjoy your wedding planning without drama, otherwise you\u2019ll also ruin your partners enjoyment. Your partner is right. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "I think YTA. You can definitely feel hurt, but I think you\u2019re overreacting. \n\nI know weddings make people think everything revolves around them, but it simply isn\u2019t true. I highly doubt your SIL has been plotting to ruin your wedding for two years. She didn\u2019t ask you to move your wedding a whole year; she asked you to move it away from one particular week and you are the ones who decided it had to be pushed a full year. I highly doubt your SIL was planning on getting engaged and plotting her own wedding specifically to be inconvenient in relation to yours; it\u2019s still more than a year away from now and plans change. Your SIL isn\u2019t planning her whole life around your wedding, and she shouldn\u2019t! She has her own reasons for planning her wedding when she has and I can guarantee you they don\u2019t revolve around you. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\nThe lesson here for you is that you probably shouldn\u2019t have moved your wedding the first time to accommodate one guest. But now that you have, that guest doesn\u2019t owe you the same thing back. Chill out and enjoy your day with your wife and accept that you can\u2019t do everything perfectly. Don\u2019t ask your wife to exclude her sister just because you are annoyed about her wedding. \n\nSometimes things are inconvenient and we can\u2019t have everything we want even if we try planning for it in advance. Nothing is perfect. If you decided to push your wedding date again, something else inconvenient would inevitably pop up. It\u2019s normal for not everything to go your way all the time, even if it\u2019s important to you.", "You eloped and didn't marry? (Sorry. I just don't understand?) You eloped to go on vacation but you didn't tie the knot? I think I am just stuck on the operational definition of \"eloped?\") But, regardless, having changed your date by a year to please your SIL, you are no longer obligated to consider anyone else's needs. Get married. CONGRATULATIONS! by the way. I swear its like your SIL is attention starved or something because this is odd AH for someone to pull twice.\n\nAt any rate, it may be time for you to turn the page? A wedding lasts a day. Your marriage should last for the rest of your life. And I would not want the goofy stuff to make me unhappy. Unless you can afford to help broke SIL with the costs of her duties, accept that she can't get blood from a stone and do that graciously.\n\nYour fiance probably just does not want you to hate her sister - even though her sister is clearly a tad self involved? I see both your position and fianc\u00e9's. NAH. You're the only one who will be seen as building a spite fence that lasts for decades. Don't do that. Its not worth it?", "NTA SIL drew first blood, go nuclear of her ass!", "YTA only in terms that your wife is ok with  her sister being there and you could cause a massive rift in your wife's family.\n\nYou are already married to your wife. You are having a vow renewal whilst this is extremely special to you both not everyone else will feel that way as you have been living as a married couple fir a while by the time of the celebration.\n\nSomeone planning their wedding close to yours sucks, been there got the tshirt( had friends have to choose which wedding to go to for cost. ) but it was up to our friends to decide what event was more important. \n\nYounger SIL may feel that since you are already married standing beside her other sister and being part of the legal wedding is more special and doesn't want to miss being part if that for both her sisters.", "If my reading comprehension is working, you eloped, which means you're already married. So you're not planning a \"wedding\" per se, you're planning something more along the lines of a celebration/party aping the performative aspects that come with a wedding.\n\nYour SiL however, \\*is\\* planning an actual wedding. Does it suck that it's so close to your ... whatever? Yes. Is it a bummer that if family have to choose between a formal wedding and your already married because we eloped ... event, so a lot of them may lean toward the real wedding? Yes. Are they wrong for making that choice? No. Is it valid that you're upset? Yes because people can feel how they want.\n\nShould you potentially nuke family/friend relationships by not allowing your SiL to attend your Not Wedding? Absolutely not.\n\n**The problem is you think two comparable events are happening. They are not. You eloped. You are already married. This was you and your partner's choice. The other event \\*is\\* an actual wedding, not a wedding after-the-fact. If I were in your family or friend group, I would go to the actual wedding, because you are already married.**\n\nNAH, but you are edging into AH territory with your attitude. You keep saying \"my wedding\" but what you're actually planning is a celebration event of some kind. It's not the same thing and doesn't have the same weight.", "NTA. The fact is, you moved your ceremony to accommodate her. Then she goes and plans *her* wedding a month before yours, knowing full-well not everyone will be able to attend both? I'd avoid this person going forward. No more accommodations. No more favors. She\u2019s clearly trying to make shit difficult for you--make people \"choose\". The minute she was so inconsiderate about the date after you changed yours, she lost the right to attend.\n\nPeople arguing about \"bUT YoU're ALrEadY MArRiED\". That's literally not the point. Besides, as others have also experienced: my friend got \"married\" at the courthouse before her \"real\" wedding. It was a destination ceremony. Her family is Greek and went back to the island their family is from (there are still all kinds of cousins that live there that they visit occasionally). Because of the difference in forms and stuff, it was literally just *easier* to have the paperwork technically done already in the U.S. But did that mean her ceremony in Greece with her family wasn't a \"real wedding/vow renewal\"? HELL. NO.", "NTA, but it's going to have a negative effect on your marriage. SIL is a massive AH. She clearly did this so that people would have to choose between which event to go to and counted on people choosing hers since it will happen before yours. Still, despite that, she is your wife's sister and unless your wife wants her far away from your ceremony, it will likely cause strife. I'd suggest just canceling yours if the people not being there is really a big deal, but that would likely give SIL a sense of victory, though she will get that no matter what.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seems fucked up to me.", "Yeah, she asked them to move it now she's trying to gazump them.", "Yep, for example in Mexico you get married(civil) sometimes months before your big wedding, and it is still a big deal because we are a Catholic country so you're not really married until you marry on a church for most families.", "OP says they are legally married, but want the full engagement and wedding experience as if they weren\u2019t.", "They're bitter, probably about marriage", "I understand what you mean perfectly, even though it seems like other people here don't get it.  Getting married is a hell of a lot more than just a piece of paper.", "Well, you can\u2019t experience the engagement as you\u2019re already married. What you\u2019re planning is a vow renewal ceremony, not a wedding.", "So you had a green card wedding then\u2026. Got it.", "You\u2019re not engaged. You\u2019re already married.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting downvoted. Apparently, too many can\u2019t see how this sucks because of SIL. It\u2019s like she waited and then one upped you.", "Pretty much, it's not even her guest, it's her partners guest if we're being real.  Partner doesn't care about it.  \n\n\nIt's like a thinly veiled ultimatum of \"me or your sister!\" and that's just toxic", "Kind of is. They are doing this for the \"experience\" and if we're being realistic, it's why it's \"small\" because the majority of people who'd come if it were an actual wedding rather than a \"me\" party is a very different number of guests because next to no one is feeling obligated to go to a \"not an actual wedding\" event.", "There will be many of the same family members who will not be able to afford both weddings. OP moved the date for her SIL per her request which was a generous thing to do. SIL is the A H.", "THANKS. I really don't get it now. Why is the SIL even a factor. Ignore. Ignore. Ignore.", "You say it's her second wedding like that makes it worth less than yours, but yours is a vow renewal. No one gets to call dibs on it being their \"first wedding\" in this instance.\n\nAs for insisting you think of her when she's not thinking of you... she's not making a fuss about you not being able to come. She's not trying desperately to get other people to force you to come or shame you for saying you can't make it. If other people choose to prioritize SIL's wedding over yours, that is an issue you need to take up with *them*, not her. Yes, you rescheduled for her PhD graduation. But you don't know for sure that your ILs wouldn't have chosen her graduation over your wedding.\n\nI sympathize with the fact that you weren't able to have the engagement and wedding that yoi dreamed of. That must suck. And it must suck that other people aren't giving what you consider your wedding the level of excitement that you want. But they are not *your* family. They are your wife's family, and you need to go with what she wants.", "Then this makes it the second wedding for both SIL and for the two of you.\n\nYour first wedding was when you signed the marriage certificate. Just because it didn't include the pageantry doesn't make it not a wedding. Your wedding date is on the certificate.\n\nUnless you kept the first wedding secret, this is how your prospective attendees will see it.\n\nAs an aside, I think you're exaggerating the level of malevolence (but not the level of inconvenience) in SIL's plans.", "So just to unravel the knot - you are married already but you are having a wedding?", "They're already married.", "YWBTA  if OP did so. Unless this is a deliberate action by SIL, its circumstantial/coincidence. OP provides no such argument/evidence.", "Do you think there a chance SIL did this intentionally to throw chaos into the works?", "OP is already married (hence the \"eloped\") they are doing this purely for some \"experience\"   \n\n\nwhereas SIL isn't married and is actually getting married", "The \"it's the legal part that's important\" part is super weird to me. \n\n\nMy best friend got legally married in her home city before her destination wedding - made the paperwork easier. \n\nMy husband and I eloped but we still want to throw a big party to celebrate (originally scheduled for summer 2020, obviously postponed lol), and if someone doesn't think it's not important because they weren't there when we filed the papers, sucks to be them, but it doesn't invalidate my celebration. \n\nMy husband and I were together for like 7 years, living together for most of it before we got married, it's not like it was a big step into adulthood and our first apartment right or something lol", "Yeah, I understand wanting a big wedding celebration after officially being married on paper for practical reasons, but I don't really get what an engagement could mean in this scenario.", "Lol what is this?  You can absolutely have a wedding if you want after you've done the documents.\n\nThey're legally married.  Do people not realize that most people do both a wedding ceremony and a legal marriage situation?  You're not automatically legally married when you exchange vows in all countries/cultures.  In fact, I'm pretty sure in most Western ones they're different.", "Or military. I know a few military couples who eloped before one is deployed or to get spousal benefits and then did the formal wedding later.", "And again, the wedding and the party are great but, they aren't the marriage. Focus on the marriage. The wedding is just great pomp and circumstance.", "That doesn't actually matter. Everything was booked.and now the other sister can't be a bridesmaid, and not everyone might be able to come. I'd be really hurt too. \nIf it was OPs own sister it would be up to OP if she uninvited her. However, it is OPs wife's sister in law and wife wants her sister there. So that's it.", "Exactly! This is basically their 2nd anniversary since they were going to do their public celebration on their 1st anniversary.\n\nI do get her hurt thoigh, they should\u2019ve just told sister nope, we\u2019re doing this on our first anniversary, besides being within a week means people can come to town a week if they\u2019re invited to both.\n\nEither way though they had their wedding.", "Which is also for the 'experience' because she could get married signing a paper in a courthouse. Just because OP already did that doesn't mean she doesn't have the same right to a wedding that SIL does.", "Yep, I understand it's \"important\" because legal things and that, but the party, the celebration, the coming together of the families to celebrate the union that's the important part. The legal part it's just that, something that you have to do because the government said it's important jajaja"]}
