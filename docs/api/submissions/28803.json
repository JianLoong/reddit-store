There were few enough people coming that the couple decided to switch to a destination wedding in Hawaii and pay their guests travel & lodging costs.  Suddenly the SIL (and her family of 5) changed their mind about attending the wedding and wanted the free trip.  \n\nIf SIL's events end up eroding your guest list substantially, maybe upgrade your event for the ones who do choose to attend.", "It doesn't matter that you're already legally married. You planned a celebration to include your family in your joy. SIL made a request that the date be changed, and you were kind enough to accommodate her because you wanted her to be a part of that celebration. Now, after things have been decided, she has made a decision that will potentially deprive you of the company of people you wanted there, and that hurts. It feels, if not an intentional slight, at least inconsiderate on her part.\n\nNTA, and all of the YTA responses confuse me. This has nothing to do with who's already married, and everything to do with giving basic courtesy where it's due. But I don't think uninviting SIL is the right move here. You've told her you won't be able to make her wedding, which she seems okay with, but you haven't told her that you feel hurt by the lack of respect she's showing by making the schedule impossible for you, when you made it work for her. \n\nOf course she's entitled to whatever date she wants, and if that's her priority you've already made your decision not to attend her wedding. But before you burn this bridge, have a heart-to-heart and share your feelings. Maybe the two of you will find another solution. Or maybe she'll reveal she did it on purpose and you can uninvite her with impunity. Or any number of possibilities in between. So many of these posts are matters of poor communication; don't let that darken a day you've been planning for years.", "Jesus. No one is the asshole. These comments suck. \n\nYes, it is totally okay to be upset about how close her wedding is to yours, especially because you planned yours first.  People don\u2019t realize this, but loads of people in your family may have to choose which wedding they attend now. For some, travel and work schedules make it hard to go to both. This exact scenario happened to me, but my SIL planned hers for 2 months after mine. People chose to go to hers because it was at a resort, causing many folks to cancel their plans to come to ours. It sucked having so many people tell me they\u2019d rather go to hers than ours. And that\u2019s what happens. \n\nOn the other hand, she is allowed to pick whatever day she wants. It\u2019s inconsiderate to choose a date so close to yours, but this is one of those things where if you make a big deal out of it you look jealous, so you have no choice but to deal with it.", "NTA. NO ONE should ask someone to move a wedding for their own personal needs. The fact you did and now she wants you to do it again? Lame - SIL seems incredibly self centered. In terms of you already eloping, who cares? If your plan was to get married and then do a big wedding later, then live your best life and do what\u2019s best for YOU and your partner, not anyone else. Honestly I\u2019d make your wedding the same day as her doctorate now \ud83d\ude02", "NTA although it should be a decision that you and your wife make because it's her sister, not yours.\n\n\nI can completely see why you'd be upset, you moved your celebration an entire year just to accommodate her graduation and then the year rolls around and suddenly she Has to get married right near the date you chose? She's got big \"main character energy\" as the Reddit kids say and has little to no respect for your wife. \n\n\nI'd be interested to know if your wife has always been in the shadow of her sister and if this kind of thing is common. \n\n\nTbh I'm surprised at all the YTA comments that insist because you two had to elope that your actual celebration is no longer important. It is, and I hope you get to have one you both enjoy. Congratulations", "NTA. SiL has now stepped on your wedding *twice*. That's rude.", "NTA \n\nI guess I wouldn\u2019t go as far to disinvite her. But you\u2019ve moved this event for her once and she doesn\u2019t even care that you guys can\u2019t attend her wedding.. that\u2019s kinda messed up. But I\u2019m not sure I would want her at my wedding either.", "NTA for being upset about it, that was a dick move by SIL, but I guess kinda TA for trying to block SIL from your wedding when your partner is okay with it?", "NTA. Lots of cultures have a legal civil ceremony and then separately hold a symbolic family and friends celebration. It sounds like the OP and partner would have had the celebration much closer to the legal ceremony but they put it off for a YEAR to satisfy SIL's request and not rain on her parade. Now SIL's thanks is doing something that deliberately means the pair won't be able to attend themselves and other family members have to choose between them. Maybe SIL doesn't consider her sister's marriage as real as her own because it's two women and that makes it OK to trample on them. In any case SIL is AH. Whether OP and wife want to deal with the family drama that will inevitably ensue if they don't include her is another question. On the other hand, seems like with this SIL there is going to be family drama in any case.", "I don't get all the YTa votes because you're not. Your sil sure is tho! All you can do is hope for the best at this point. NTA", "NTA", "Nta , U have a right to be angry but at the end of the day Ur finances sister not attending the wedding isn't gonna do anything but create problems between them . So I say just be more cautious of her in the future", "YTA.  You're already married.  Stop trying to be the main character in everyone's life.", "NTA. But you go LC with sil. Looking at scenario now it seems like your wife is fine with everything so disinviting sil will cause drama and maybe affect your relationship with your wife. So not worth it.waht sil is doing is so wrong. Pls don't do anything to affect your relationship", "YTA. You're already married.", "YTA because it is lowering yourself,  and that action could cause you to lose guests if their family find our about your retaliation. \n\nPersonally I would move the wedding back to next year if you can,  better to clash with the graduation than the wedding especially if SIL doesn't care of you can't make her wedding then you don't need to accomodate her for yours?", "NTA. I don\u2019t get all these Y T A comments. Yeah, you\u2019re already married but that doesn\u2019t change the fact you had this planned well in advance of your SIL. Plus, the fact you pushed yours out by a year to accommodate her only to get a slap in the face by her plans solidifies the fact you\u2019re completely right to feel this way.", "ESH. And I say this as a soft ESH. You have every right to be upset and she has every right to plan her wedding around the same time. It sucks, it truly does, but to kick her out over it is not a good enough reason and comes off as retaliatory. This is similar to what my fianc\u00e9 and I are dealing with. My fianc\u00e9s cousin had their wedding delayed because of the pandemic and had to reschedule. The day they chose to reschedule it to? Mine and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding date that\u2019s coming up next week. Understandably, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin is upset that the family is choosing to go to our wedding over theirs (since they were planning by 2020), but we secured the date in before them and had save the dates out before their announcement of the reschedule. What did they do? Kick out some of the family from their wedding that we had invited to ours as retaliation. It\u2019s a frustrating situation you\u2019re in OP, but do what you can without making things even more stressful. Stick to your guns of what you\u2019re planning to do and let your SIL know that you\u2019re not gonna accommodate anything else. If more people want to go to her wedding over yours, think of it positively that you won\u2019t have to spend as much money on shit. I\u2019m wishing you guys the best and congrats everything!", "you're the asshole, for pushing a wedding because someone had a graduation in the same week. If anything a graduation in the same week means the SIL could have more family in town to celebrate for her night because more people would be in town for the wedding. why on earth push it for that or for her, and yes, her putting her wedding a month ahead of yours so people can't afford or take time off to do both is a seemingly pretty deliberate act.\n\nI'd say at a gathering of family in front of a bunch of people that it would be nice if she pushed her wedding up or later the same way you moved your entire wedding a year just for her graduation, make it very clear that you accommodated her massively, make her say no and look unreasonable in front of everyone. Does seem kind of deliberate and petty from her.\n\nNTA.", "Good grief!  Just invite everyone and, if they can't attend, try to be understanding.  YTA.", "YTA. I can see why you're hurt but translating that hurt into not wanting the SIL at your wedding is childish.", "YTA I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re already married. Fair enough you tried accommodate her by changing the date etc but at the end of the day you\u2019re married already", "YTA this doesnt sound fair. It sounds controlling and immature.\n\nDo you really want to offend her to the point of NC over a date? You are already married!", "NTA", "YTA. Her wedding is more than a month ahead of yours? That\u2019s absolutely fine.\n\nYou have plenty of advance notice to work out the time off issue. \n\nYour partner gets a say too, right? Right?\n\nI see where you\u2019re coming from though, enjoy your wedding.", "YTA. She's your partner's sister, not yours. If your partner doesn't mind, you don't get to demand SIL doesn't attend. It would be different if SIL had said or done something truly hurtful to you, but she hasn't. She's just been living her life and making her own plans.", "NTA.\n\nYou already accommodated them, now they pull this?\n\nNot cool.", "YTA\n\nSounds like you will have been married for two years at the time of your not wedding. The most you could call it is a vow renewal.\n\nCan't blame people for not prioritizing a vow renewal over an actual wedding.", "YTA, sil is very inconsiderate for her planning but actually uninviting her, especially when your wife (her sister!) wants her there and doesnt feel its a big deal, is assholery.", "YTA - you are already married. Your wedding already happened. She is in fact getting married about 2 years after your wedding if I\u2019m reading your post correctly.   \n\nHow many more years are you going to drag this out for?", "Wait, aren\u2019t you already married? SIL isn\u2019t married. Hers will be a real wedding. Yours is a historical re-enactment/celebration. What would you have her do? Postpone her real wedding for a year to make it convenient for everyone? Your wife is right. Get on with your life already. Enjoy both your celebration and her wedding with the people who are there.", "YTA Why do people love drama in their life I just don't get it. and it's good to see it's only about what you want at the wedding.", "YTA. your already married. You want to have a party on the same day as your anniversary.   Either move the party date or get over the fact that not everyone will be able to go to your party", "You already knew she thought she world revolved around her when she asked you to push your wedding. She doesn't care about your stuff anywhere near as much as she cares about her own stuff and that's just how it is. If you don't attend her wedding, she doesn't have to attend yours. But you're not the only one getting married. So talk it out with your husband and see what he thinks. You had it right the first time, when you eloped. \n\nNTA.", "SIL can only do one wedding. So the problem is\u2026what?", "NTA I'd be pissed", "YTA. The choice to accommodate SIL was yours and your partners, so don\u2019t blame her. She asked, you said yes.  Move on. \n\nDon\u2019t go to her wedding if you can\u2019t afford it. SIL is fine with it. Why create drama for no reason? \n\nNot everyone invited will RSVP yes. This is the case for all weddings. Enjoy your wedding planning without drama, otherwise you\u2019ll also ruin your partners enjoyment. Your partner is right. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "I think YTA. You can definitely feel hurt, but I think you\u2019re overreacting. \n\nI know weddings make people think everything revolves around them, but it simply isn\u2019t true. I highly doubt your SIL has been plotting to ruin your wedding for two years. She didn\u2019t ask you to move your wedding a whole year; she asked you to move it away from one particular week and you are the ones who decided it had to be pushed a full year. I highly doubt your SIL was planning on getting engaged and plotting her own wedding specifically to be inconvenient in relation to yours; it\u2019s still more than a year away from now and plans change. Your SIL isn\u2019t planning her whole life around your wedding, and she shouldn\u2019t! She has her own reasons for planning her wedding when she has and I can guarantee you they don\u2019t revolve around you. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\nThe lesson here for you is that you probably shouldn\u2019t have moved your wedding the first time to accommodate one guest. But now that you have, that guest doesn\u2019t owe you the same thing back. Chill out and enjoy your day with your wife and accept that you can\u2019t do everything perfectly. Don\u2019t ask your wife to exclude her sister just because you are annoyed about her wedding. \n\nSometimes things are inconvenient and we can\u2019t have everything we want even if we try planning for it in advance. Nothing is perfect. If you decided to push your wedding date again, something else inconvenient would inevitably pop up. It\u2019s normal for not everything to go your way all the time, even if it\u2019s important to you.", "You eloped and didn't marry? (Sorry. I just don't understand?) You eloped to go on vacation but you didn't tie the knot? I think I am just stuck on the operational definition of \"eloped?\") But, regardless, having changed your date by a year to please your SIL, you are no longer obligated to consider anyone else's needs. Get married. CONGRATULATIONS! by the way. I swear its like your SIL is attention starved or something because this is odd AH for someone to pull twice.\n\nAt any rate, it may be time for you to turn the page? A wedding lasts a day. Your marriage should last for the rest of your life. And I would not want the goofy stuff to make me unhappy. Unless you can afford to help broke SIL with the costs of her duties, accept that she can't get blood from a stone and do that graciously.\n\nYour fiance probably just does not want you to hate her sister - even though her sister is clearly a tad self involved? I see both your position and fianc\u00e9's. NAH. You're the only one who will be seen as building a spite fence that lasts for decades. Don't do that. Its not worth it?", "NTA SIL drew first blood, go nuclear of her ass!", "YTA only in terms that your wife is ok with  her sister being there and you could cause a massive rift in your wife's family.\n\nYou are already married to your wife. You are having a vow renewal whilst this is extremely special to you both not everyone else will feel that way as you have been living as a married couple fir a while by the time of the celebration.\n\nSomeone planning their wedding close to yours sucks, been there got the tshirt( had friends have to choose which wedding to go to for cost. ) but it was up to our friends to decide what event was more important. \n\nYounger SIL may feel that since you are already married standing beside her other sister and being part of the legal wedding is more special and doesn't want to miss being part if that for both her sisters.", "If my reading comprehension is working, you eloped, which means you're already married. So you're not planning a \"wedding\" per se, you're planning something more along the lines of a celebration/party aping the performative aspects that come with a wedding.\n\nYour SiL however, \\*is\\* planning an actual wedding. Does it suck that it's so close to your ... whatever? Yes. Is it a bummer that if family have to choose between a formal wedding and your already married because we eloped ... event, so a lot of them may lean toward the real wedding? Yes. Are they wrong for making that choice? No. Is it valid that you're upset? Yes because people can feel how they want.\n\nShould you potentially nuke family/friend relationships by not allowing your SiL to attend your Not Wedding? Absolutely not.\n\n**The problem is you think two comparable events are happening. They are not. You eloped. You are already married. This was you and your partner's choice. The other event \\*is\\* an actual wedding, not a wedding after-the-fact. If I were in your family or friend group, I would go to the actual wedding, because you are already married.**\n\nNAH, but you are edging into AH territory with your attitude. You keep saying \"my wedding\" but what you're actually planning is a celebration event of some kind. It's not the same thing and doesn't have the same weight.", "NTA. The fact is, you moved your ceremony to accommodate her. Then she goes and plans *her* wedding a month before yours, knowing full-well not everyone will be able to attend both? I'd avoid this person going forward. No more accommodations. No more favors. She\u2019s clearly trying to make shit difficult for you--make people \"choose\". The minute she was so inconsiderate about the date after you changed yours, she lost the right to attend.\n\nPeople arguing about \"bUT YoU're ALrEadY MArRiED\". That's literally not the point. Besides, as others have also experienced: my friend got \"married\" at the courthouse before her \"real\" wedding. It was a destination ceremony. Her family is Greek and went back to the island their family is from (there are still all kinds of cousins that live there that they visit occasionally). Because of the difference in forms and stuff, it was literally just *easier* to have the paperwork technically done already in the U.S. But did that mean her ceremony in Greece with her family wasn't a \"real wedding/vow renewal\"? HELL. NO.", "NTA, but it's going to have a negative effect on your marriage. SIL is a massive AH. She clearly did this so that people would have to choose between which event to go to and counted on people choosing hers since it will happen before yours. Still, despite that, she is your wife's sister and unless your wife wants her far away from your ceremony, it will likely cause strife. I'd suggest just canceling yours if the people not being there is really a big deal, but that would likely give SIL a sense of victory, though she will get that no matter what.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's not trying desperately to get other people to force you to come or shame you for saying you can't make it.

Doesn't mean she doesn't respect you, and respect isn't a good reason to ask your wife to uninvite her *sister*.\n\nYTA. Not due to being married already, not for seeming some way about anything, but because this is your wife's sister. You've put your wife in a very tough situation, where she has to tread carefully. If you demand she not be invited, you are ruining a relationship with her family. If you suggested it and honor what your wife decides, your wife has to worry that if she invites her sister, you'll harbor resentment. She can't win here. \n\nYour post didn't make it sound like SIL is always this way, so I'd find it much more likely she's just trying to deal with what she's got. You didn't *have* to move the wedding but you did, just for her. At the time, she wasn't engaged. Now that she is, it's not just her who chooses the date. She was probably also working around family and her SOs family, preferred time of year, etc. It's just bad timing. She's not asking you to change it again, and I get being hurt that she wouldn't change it for you to attend, after you went through so much trouble for her. Perhaps she comes and isn't a bridesmaid, is that the end of the world? Will you be any less happily married? Usually this type of \"don't want someone there who doesn't respect me\" thing looks poorly, because even if it isn't about power, you have no idea how much some of the other guests respect you, or if SIL respects you but isn't very thoughtful.", "Yta.\n\nTake the high road here, it will pay off later.

We were accepted for who we were, and married without a hint of transphobia, homophobia, or any other kind of bigotry.\n\nBy many people's logic, that ceremony wasn't important. We were already married the day before. I'm here to tell all of you that sometimes life, (and outdated, bigoted laws), won't allow you to do the legal part in comfort, if at all. The ceremony, where you can pledge to one another without interference, where you can say your vows without crying bitter tears, where you can focus on the love of your life rather than the law treating you like trash, is the only part worth remembering.\n\n(For those wondering, we are in the UK and married years before the law changed to allow same-sex marriage.

Since this is the partner's sister, and the partner is not very bothered by what's happened, OP has no right to ban her partner's sister from the wedding.\n\nOP's plan likely wouldn't just cause issues with SIL, either. It will probably cause all sorts of drama within her [the partner's] family and damage relationships that mean more to the partner than to OP. If it were OP's sister, she could uninvite/ban away, because she would be burning her own bridges.\n\nBut you don't vow to love and support someone for the rest of your lives and then try to cause/exacerbate problems with a family they are ostensibly fond of and close to.\n\nedit: forgot the word \"not\"", "You think their family relationships aren\u2019t already screwed up?\n\n>her sister (28F) was graduating college for her doctorate during that same week so she asked if we could push the wedding. \n\nThat\u2019s reasonable. As presumably OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e wants her sister at her wedding that\u2019s good information to have\n\n>we moved it to the following year as we want to have the ceremony on the same day that we eloped\n\nAgain, proper response and still keeping to a special date that is important to them. \n\n>Recently, SIL got engaged to her fianc\u00e9e. I just found out this morning that SIL has planned her wedding for just over a month ahead of our wedding\n\nSo after save the dates have gone out for OP\u2019s wedding she decides to have her wedding a month before OP without talking about if they\u2019d be able to attend? Sounds like she didn\u2019t care if they attended. She just wants to get married before OP and her fianc\u00e9e. \n\n>My partners younger sister was supposed to be one of my partners bridesmaids, and as a broke college student in their words they won't be able to do both. \n\nThis is where I get completely disgusted with the SIL. Not only did she pick the date without considering if her sister can come, she made it so their younger sister felt she had to drop out and skip the wedding she had originally committed to. \n\nNo, the family relationships there are already screwed up. OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is just still in the \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d phase of having a sister that only thinks about herself.", "That's a wedding. Lots of countries have \"marriage\" occur separately, and the county registrar. The wedding is the ceremony. Not every place allows the ceremony officiant or religious officiant to sign the legal marriage documents. That doesn't make it less of a wedding. It's still a wedding.", "Nowhere is it stated that many have chosen not to attend OP's reception. MIL & FIL are concerned about travel costs, and younger SIL is concerned about bridesmaid costs. For weddings not happening until 2025 that haven't been rsvp'd to yet. There is plenty of time to figure out finances and communicate to reach a positive outcome without petty behavior. \n\nAlso, OP has a wife, not a husband.", "It\u2019s still her fianc\u00e9es sister. The fianc\u00e9e gets to make the call about whether or not her family is invited to her wedding. This isn\u2019t a two yes one no situation, they\u2019re wedding guests, not children or pets you have to care for for years.", ">How can you know that? SIL might hate OP.\n\nI don't know for sure, SIL might hate OP and maybe did target OP. But even if she did the main person it would hurt is the partner. \n\nIt is just part of the general your family your issues kind of thing. For arguments sake  lets say the SIL was targeting OP  and hated them. At the end of the day the person it would hurt the most is the Partner/SIL's sibling, because it is the sibling they are potentially robbing of having all their family there. \n\nFor OP if partners Aunt Sally, cousin Susy don't come to the wedding because they went to SILs wedding first, it does not really hurt OP because her family is still there.", "She asked them to move it from that particular week; *they could have said no*.", "I don't think it's overly dramatic to hate having to misgender your spouse just so you can legally marry. (Thankfully UK law has changed so that's not necessary anymore.) \n\nAs for time between the two, you do the legal part and then have a ceremony when you can. Length of time shouldn't matter. Plenty of people get married for legal reasons but can't afford a ceremony at the time. Then once they're financially better off, they have the ceremony they always wanted. I've known a number of couples do things that way, one is just a bit of paper you sign, the other is a meaningful, heartfelt, memorable event. No one talks about our wedding and means the registry office, even the ones who were there!", "But the question the post asks isn\u2019t if SIL is the asshole for her wedding date. The post title asks if OP would be the asshole for uninviting her wife\u2019s sister - against her wife\u2019s wishes.", "Scheduling your wedding to fuck up your sister's after having them move it for you was the nuclear move.  Definitely a relationship test and OP's wife is failing her.", "The true relationship test is how OPs wife responded. The SIL basically took a fat shit right on their heads and OPs wife is perfectly ok with that. Personally, I would have a serious sit down and talk with wife because this is insane. Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life, kowtowing to SILs extreme disrespect with no way to defend yourself? Yeah fuck that, this would have me seriously considering divorce because I could not live my life like that, I simply have too much self respect to not rip SIL a new asshole for asking to move the reception and then intentionally planning her wedding a month before. There\u2019s no way all of the family is gonna be able to make both, and we all know the majority are gonna pick the actual wedding over the reception. Honestly this relationship seems doomed to fail unless OPs wife suddenly grows a spine, OP seems to have at least a modicum of self respect while wifey is content with being a doormat and dragging OP down with her.", "I think it's *obvious* that's what she did", "Absolutely.", "Yes. You get one wedding. What they are planning is an elaborate reception, which is fine as long as everyone knows OP and spouse aren't actually getting married at this event.", "Earning a doctorate is a big deal, and college graduation ceremonies can't be moved as easily as an after-the-fact party, which is what OP is throwing. There are so many factors that may be in play as to why SiL chose her wedding date, not all of them mean, but we don't know.\n\nWhat we do know is SiL is holding an actual wedding, while already married OP is throwing a wedding-themed party. They are not on equal footing.\n\nThinking about it, I wonder if more folks in the family were irritated about eloping and following it up with all the performative aspects of a wedding than OP realized. SiL's wedding gives them the perfect out.", "Who is it that won't be able to attend, though? Nobody has even confirmed they could or couldn't go because rsvps haven't been sent yet. MIL & FIL are the only ones OP has stated who are concerned about travel expenses. There is plenty of time for OP and spouse to discuss this with SIL. Explaining to her how spouse feels at potentially not having her parents at her reception and asking SIL if she could cover their travel or other SIL's bridesmaid costs could have a beneficial outcome.", "\"I can't attend since I have my graduation which has been tentatively scheduled in the many years I've been working on my PhD.\"\n\nA wedding (or a celebration of an elopement) doesn't take precedence over a PhD graduation for any objective reason. So it would be OP putting the Sil and family in the awkward position of choosing. \n\nIf anything, OP+spouse are the asshole for even scheduling it in the same week in the first place. \n\nOP is causing themselves a lot of headaches by insisting the celebration be on the exact day of the elopement.", "I guess that goes into the philosophical nature  of \"What does it truly mean to be married, is it just a legal document signed, or does it entail showing those who care about you, your love\"", "Again, I disagree. SIL FAFO. The fact that OP's wife isn't seeing a problem with her sister's behavior is annoying. They made special accommodations for her. She didn't have any of the same courtesy and in fact is an AH. The level of entitlement from SIL is wild and I wonder if she behaves entitled and demanding in other ways. SIL has main character syndrome bad.", "I'll admit that possible homophobia was the first thing to pop into my head. But is it possible that this is more of a covert, one-sided sibling rivalry?", "Personally I think it\u2019s either that or that the SIL is the oldest so she thinks she has to get married first out of some archaic tradition. I prefer to think the latter because it\u2019s less toxic, but both are strong possibilities.", "Certain things being booked doesn't mean they cant/ won't be changed. They haven't sent out rsvps yet, so they don't even have a confirmed number of guests to give the venue, caterers, transportation operator, etc. Flights haven't been booked, exact number of hotel rooms needed isn't confirmed yet, most the things at this early stage in wedding planning are a tentative hold instead of being set in stone. There is well over a year to figure out finances, I hope they can communicate to make it work for everyone.", "Are you thinking of some kind of supervillain origin here?", "She has a PhD in Horribleness", "\u201cComes across as a little disrespectful,\u201d is such a nothingburger. Its simply not a reason to deny your spouse having their family at their wedding.", "Sorry I think we will have to agree to disagree because I think doing it on the date they actually did get married is a great idea.", "There have been multiple posts on Reddit recently about covert homophobes that didn\u2019t expose themselves until the wedding. So assuming that OP would have said something about it is not exactly supported by evidence. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t know why she asked for it to be moved. Honestly with her current behavior I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if it was so that the focus would be on her. Like, getting a PhD is hard and deserves to be recognized, but I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if she doesn\u2019t show to OP\u2019s wedding. \n\nThese weddings aren\u2019t scheduled until 2025. There is absolutely no reason that she couldn\u2019t have scheduled it so that everyone could attend both weddings but she didn\u2019t. There\u2019s a reason for that. Now, I prefer to be generous and say it\u2019s because she\u2019s the oldest so wants to get married first, but homophobia has a non-zero chance of being the explanation.", "Given the amount of discrimination - including backed by law - around being a part of the LGBTQ+ community, it\u2019s a reflexive double-check we all do. Even around people who haven\u2019t shown themselves to be problems yet, because some people are damn good at masking it.\n\nNot having to interrogate every negative interaction for bias is a very privileged take that you only get to have if you\u2019re very certain categories, like straight, cisgender and white. \n\nJust FYI.", "It can simultaneously be a good idea from an emotional side but one that causes many practical issues. It means you have one date in a given year that you can choose and if that date doesn't work you postpone the celebration a year.", "And putting everything under homophobia is also a rampant problem especially online .", "Probably because homophobia itself is so rampant online\u2026", "NTA It's clear your SIL doesn't respect your wedding as a real wedding.", "INFO: by \"save the dates have been created\",  do you mean you've sent out the actual save the dates or have you simply had them printed but not yet mailed? \n\nAlso, I think clarification about the ~vibes~ of SIL'S request to change the wedding date are key. Did she say \"your wedding is the same week as my graduation. You must love it\" or was it \"oh no! Your wedding is the same week as my graduation so I won't be able to come. I'm really bummed\" . Also, if your partner pushed to change the original wedding date bc she wanted her sister there.... That's not really on your SIL and also completely reasonable (especially if family has already made arrangements to attend the graduation. I've had to book hotel rooms years in advance for big undergrad graduations and I've also gone to smaller PhD graduations where there were multiple ceremonies and receptions and dinners that families attended in the days surrounding the official graduation). I feel like, generally, we don't have anywhere near enough information about the entire situation to make a call HOWEVER. If you are asking if you are an asshole for telling your wife her sister is uninvited from your wedding, of course you are. This would be a discussion to be had with your wife, not an unequivocal demand.", "Yta. If her own sister isn\u2019t stressed or offended by it, why are you? That\u2019s her sister & you are putting her in a bad spot. If you already eloped, it\u2019s a vow renewal, more than a wedding but even still, they are a month apart. I don\u2019t understand why that offends you. Making this a big deal (again, I don\u2019t understand the issue) & destroying her relationship w her sister & possibly her family is not a good way to start things. If her family does something egregious, she should handle it & you should handle your own family", "YTA. I can see why this is upsetting. But at the end of the day, she is family and none of this is worth possible estrangement.\n\nJust remember that a wedding is about celebrating your love and your lives together. Nothing trumps that, even if you had to get married at City Hall with only strangers witnessing it, it's still your marriage to the one you love.\n\nFocus on the most important thing, and let the rest go.", "I\u2019m sorry I get why you feel a little upset but YTA she was understanding of you not being able to come isn\u2019t kicking up a fuss demanding you be there and I assume understanding if others choose your wedding. You can not exclude your partners family if she wants them there and you have an otherwise good relationship. \n\nYour younger SIL is likely prioritising the other wedding because your already married expect others to do the same.", "NTA SIL is. You moved your wedding for her once and she doesn't even have the decency to have hers after yours. Talk about family drama.", "YTA for assuming people should plan their life around you.\n\nBesides, your wedding is just pretend, they are doing the real thing.", "YTA\n\nYour event is not a wedding. You said you eloped so you are already married.\n\nYou chose a nontraditional path, which is fine. Everyone else still gets to live their lives and get married on their own timelines.\n\nYour partner is right. Why is this non-wedding event so important to you?", "I swear I didn't see this post when I commented almost the same thing!", "I mean, I agree is not good to just disinvite SIL because of it, but I understand OP's POV on the fact that they postponed their wedding one whole year to acomodate SIL and now she is having her wedding only one month after and I don't doubt that many of the partner's family Will prefer going to SIL's wedding because \"they're technically already married\" so they not only Will wait one more year because of it but will also loose a big part of the guests/wedding party.\nHonnestly I even think SIL herself won't attend OP's wedding because she Will be busy with her own planning. So It feels kind of unfair that SIL chose this date after asking OP and her partner to change the date for her once already.", "Except that SIL just asked them to move the date, not to move it a whole year out. OP is making the exact date precious. Everyone else is just living their lives without making OP, who is already married, front and center.", "Tbh scheduling a wedding for the same week as a sibling's graduation is also a main character move *shrug* . (In my experience, ppl run potential wedding dates by sibs/parents and other close relatives to see if there is a conflict. Especially if it's not being planned years in advance. Not bc the wedding isn't important but bc they recognize that other people are people too and may have prior commitments. It's not like her sister could move the entire university's graduation to accommodate her sister's wedding. And I wonder if the \"ask\" was more of a \"hey, just so you know that's my graduation week and I won't be able to attend your wedding\" coupled with the parents saying \"pls don't make us choose. You will not be pleased with the outcome\" that caused the wedding to change)", "Perhaps, if it were a real wedding.", "More mature than most of these responses.", "She didn't \"make\" them push it back a year - they chose to push it back a whole year rather than say no or just move it a few days.", "I wouldn\u2019t want her there.\n\nNTA", "SIL didnt ak them to delay a year.\n\nOP chose to delay it (they could have refused) or just put it a week earlier/back.", "Fair enough; they\u2019re the ones who want their wedding to fall in a specific date.

Nothing about this post involves trans rights so you're clearly just trying to use it as some sort of weird \"I married a trans person so that makes all my unrelated arguments above criticism\" trump card.\n\nWhich... no.  Cool story, bro, but it doesn't have anything to do with the matter at hand.", "I don't know, at this point OP has already been married for two years by her \"wedding\" date. I've had \"weddings\" in my extended family for couples who eloped and were married for over a year prior to the \"wedding\". It doesn't have to be homophobia for people to not take that seriously.

There's a chance it was related to this being a same sex marriage. There's also a good chance it's nothing to do with that at all.
