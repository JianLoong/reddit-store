There were few enough people coming that the couple decided to switch to a destination wedding in Hawaii and pay their guests travel & lodging costs.  Suddenly the SIL (and her family of 5) changed their mind about attending the wedding and wanted the free trip.  \n\nIf SIL's events end up eroding your guest list substantially, maybe upgrade your event for the ones who do choose to attend.", "It doesn't matter that you're already legally married. You planned a celebration to include your family in your joy. SIL made a request that the date be changed, and you were kind enough to accommodate her because you wanted her to be a part of that celebration. Now, after things have been decided, she has made a decision that will potentially deprive you of the company of people you wanted there, and that hurts. It feels, if not an intentional slight, at least inconsiderate on her part.\n\nNTA, and all of the YTA responses confuse me. This has nothing to do with who's already married, and everything to do with giving basic courtesy where it's due. But I don't think uninviting SIL is the right move here. You've told her you won't be able to make her wedding, which she seems okay with, but you haven't told her that you feel hurt by the lack of respect she's showing by making the schedule impossible for you, when you made it work for her. \n\nOf course she's entitled to whatever date she wants, and if that's her priority you've already made your decision not to attend her wedding. But before you burn this bridge, have a heart-to-heart and share your feelings. Maybe the two of you will find another solution. Or maybe she'll reveal she did it on purpose and you can uninvite her with impunity. Or any number of possibilities in between. So many of these posts are matters of poor communication; don't let that darken a day you've been planning for years.", "Jesus. No one is the asshole. These comments suck. \n\nYes, it is totally okay to be upset about how close her wedding is to yours, especially because you planned yours first.  People don\u2019t realize this, but loads of people in your family may have to choose which wedding they attend now. For some, travel and work schedules make it hard to go to both. This exact scenario happened to me, but my SIL planned hers for 2 months after mine. People chose to go to hers because it was at a resort, causing many folks to cancel their plans to come to ours. It sucked having so many people tell me they\u2019d rather go to hers than ours. And that\u2019s what happens. \n\nOn the other hand, she is allowed to pick whatever day she wants. It\u2019s inconsiderate to choose a date so close to yours, but this is one of those things where if you make a big deal out of it you look jealous, so you have no choice but to deal with it.", "NTA. NO ONE should ask someone to move a wedding for their own personal needs. The fact you did and now she wants you to do it again? Lame - SIL seems incredibly self centered. In terms of you already eloping, who cares? If your plan was to get married and then do a big wedding later, then live your best life and do what\u2019s best for YOU and your partner, not anyone else. Honestly I\u2019d make your wedding the same day as her doctorate now \ud83d\ude02", "NTA although it should be a decision that you and your wife make because it's her sister, not yours.\n\n\nI can completely see why you'd be upset, you moved your celebration an entire year just to accommodate her graduation and then the year rolls around and suddenly she Has to get married right near the date you chose? She's got big \"main character energy\" as the Reddit kids say and has little to no respect for your wife. \n\n\nI'd be interested to know if your wife has always been in the shadow of her sister and if this kind of thing is common. \n\n\nTbh I'm surprised at all the YTA comments that insist because you two had to elope that your actual celebration is no longer important. It is, and I hope you get to have one you both enjoy. Congratulations", "NTA. SiL has now stepped on your wedding *twice*. That's rude.", "NTA \n\nI guess I wouldn\u2019t go as far to disinvite her. But you\u2019ve moved this event for her once and she doesn\u2019t even care that you guys can\u2019t attend her wedding.. that\u2019s kinda messed up. But I\u2019m not sure I would want her at my wedding either.", "NTA for being upset about it, that was a dick move by SIL, but I guess kinda TA for trying to block SIL from your wedding when your partner is okay with it?", "NTA. Lots of cultures have a legal civil ceremony and then separately hold a symbolic family and friends celebration. It sounds like the OP and partner would have had the celebration much closer to the legal ceremony but they put it off for a YEAR to satisfy SIL's request and not rain on her parade. Now SIL's thanks is doing something that deliberately means the pair won't be able to attend themselves and other family members have to choose between them. Maybe SIL doesn't consider her sister's marriage as real as her own because it's two women and that makes it OK to trample on them. In any case SIL is AH. Whether OP and wife want to deal with the family drama that will inevitably ensue if they don't include her is another question. On the other hand, seems like with this SIL there is going to be family drama in any case.", "I don't get all the YTa votes because you're not. Your sil sure is tho! All you can do is hope for the best at this point. NTA", "NTA", "Nta , U have a right to be angry but at the end of the day Ur finances sister not attending the wedding isn't gonna do anything but create problems between them . So I say just be more cautious of her in the future", "YTA.  You're already married.  Stop trying to be the main character in everyone's life.", "NTA. But you go LC with sil. Looking at scenario now it seems like your wife is fine with everything so disinviting sil will cause drama and maybe affect your relationship with your wife. So not worth it.waht sil is doing is so wrong. Pls don't do anything to affect your relationship", "YTA. You're already married.", "YTA because it is lowering yourself,  and that action could cause you to lose guests if their family find our about your retaliation. \n\nPersonally I would move the wedding back to next year if you can,  better to clash with the graduation than the wedding especially if SIL doesn't care of you can't make her wedding then you don't need to accomodate her for yours?", "NTA. I don\u2019t get all these Y T A comments. Yeah, you\u2019re already married but that doesn\u2019t change the fact you had this planned well in advance of your SIL. Plus, the fact you pushed yours out by a year to accommodate her only to get a slap in the face by her plans solidifies the fact you\u2019re completely right to feel this way.", "ESH. And I say this as a soft ESH. You have every right to be upset and she has every right to plan her wedding around the same time. It sucks, it truly does, but to kick her out over it is not a good enough reason and comes off as retaliatory. This is similar to what my fianc\u00e9 and I are dealing with. My fianc\u00e9s cousin had their wedding delayed because of the pandemic and had to reschedule. The day they chose to reschedule it to? Mine and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding date that\u2019s coming up next week. Understandably, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin is upset that the family is choosing to go to our wedding over theirs (since they were planning by 2020), but we secured the date in before them and had save the dates out before their announcement of the reschedule. What did they do? Kick out some of the family from their wedding that we had invited to ours as retaliation. It\u2019s a frustrating situation you\u2019re in OP, but do what you can without making things even more stressful. Stick to your guns of what you\u2019re planning to do and let your SIL know that you\u2019re not gonna accommodate anything else. If more people want to go to her wedding over yours, think of it positively that you won\u2019t have to spend as much money on shit. I\u2019m wishing you guys the best and congrats everything!", "you're the asshole, for pushing a wedding because someone had a graduation in the same week. If anything a graduation in the same week means the SIL could have more family in town to celebrate for her night because more people would be in town for the wedding. why on earth push it for that or for her, and yes, her putting her wedding a month ahead of yours so people can't afford or take time off to do both is a seemingly pretty deliberate act.\n\nI'd say at a gathering of family in front of a bunch of people that it would be nice if she pushed her wedding up or later the same way you moved your entire wedding a year just for her graduation, make it very clear that you accommodated her massively, make her say no and look unreasonable in front of everyone. Does seem kind of deliberate and petty from her.\n\nNTA.", "Good grief!  Just invite everyone and, if they can't attend, try to be understanding.  YTA.", "YTA. I can see why you're hurt but translating that hurt into not wanting the SIL at your wedding is childish.", "YTA I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re already married. Fair enough you tried accommodate her by changing the date etc but at the end of the day you\u2019re married already", "YTA this doesnt sound fair. It sounds controlling and immature.\n\nDo you really want to offend her to the point of NC over a date? You are already married!", "NTA", "YTA. Her wedding is more than a month ahead of yours? That\u2019s absolutely fine.\n\nYou have plenty of advance notice to work out the time off issue. \n\nYour partner gets a say too, right? Right?\n\nI see where you\u2019re coming from though, enjoy your wedding.", "YTA. She's your partner's sister, not yours. If your partner doesn't mind, you don't get to demand SIL doesn't attend. It would be different if SIL had said or done something truly hurtful to you, but she hasn't. She's just been living her life and making her own plans.", "NTA.\n\nYou already accommodated them, now they pull this?\n\nNot cool.", "YTA\n\nSounds like you will have been married for two years at the time of your not wedding. The most you could call it is a vow renewal.\n\nCan't blame people for not prioritizing a vow renewal over an actual wedding.", "YTA, sil is very inconsiderate for her planning but actually uninviting her, especially when your wife (her sister!) wants her there and doesnt feel its a big deal, is assholery.", "YTA - you are already married. Your wedding already happened. She is in fact getting married about 2 years after your wedding if I\u2019m reading your post correctly.   \n\nHow many more years are you going to drag this out for?", "Wait, aren\u2019t you already married? SIL isn\u2019t married. Hers will be a real wedding. Yours is a historical re-enactment/celebration. What would you have her do? Postpone her real wedding for a year to make it convenient for everyone? Your wife is right. Get on with your life already. Enjoy both your celebration and her wedding with the people who are there.", "YTA Why do people love drama in their life I just don't get it. and it's good to see it's only about what you want at the wedding.", "YTA. your already married. You want to have a party on the same day as your anniversary.   Either move the party date or get over the fact that not everyone will be able to go to your party", "You already knew she thought she world revolved around her when she asked you to push your wedding. She doesn't care about your stuff anywhere near as much as she cares about her own stuff and that's just how it is. If you don't attend her wedding, she doesn't have to attend yours. But you're not the only one getting married. So talk it out with your husband and see what he thinks. You had it right the first time, when you eloped. \n\nNTA.", "SIL can only do one wedding. So the problem is\u2026what?", "NTA I'd be pissed", "YTA. The choice to accommodate SIL was yours and your partners, so don\u2019t blame her. She asked, you said yes.  Move on. \n\nDon\u2019t go to her wedding if you can\u2019t afford it. SIL is fine with it. Why create drama for no reason? \n\nNot everyone invited will RSVP yes. This is the case for all weddings. Enjoy your wedding planning without drama, otherwise you\u2019ll also ruin your partners enjoyment. Your partner is right. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "I think YTA. You can definitely feel hurt, but I think you\u2019re overreacting. \n\nI know weddings make people think everything revolves around them, but it simply isn\u2019t true. I highly doubt your SIL has been plotting to ruin your wedding for two years. She didn\u2019t ask you to move your wedding a whole year; she asked you to move it away from one particular week and you are the ones who decided it had to be pushed a full year. I highly doubt your SIL was planning on getting engaged and plotting her own wedding specifically to be inconvenient in relation to yours; it\u2019s still more than a year away from now and plans change. Your SIL isn\u2019t planning her whole life around your wedding, and she shouldn\u2019t! She has her own reasons for planning her wedding when she has and I can guarantee you they don\u2019t revolve around you. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\nThe lesson here for you is that you probably shouldn\u2019t have moved your wedding the first time to accommodate one guest. But now that you have, that guest doesn\u2019t owe you the same thing back. Chill out and enjoy your day with your wife and accept that you can\u2019t do everything perfectly. Don\u2019t ask your wife to exclude her sister just because you are annoyed about her wedding. \n\nSometimes things are inconvenient and we can\u2019t have everything we want even if we try planning for it in advance. Nothing is perfect. If you decided to push your wedding date again, something else inconvenient would inevitably pop up. It\u2019s normal for not everything to go your way all the time, even if it\u2019s important to you.", "You eloped and didn't marry? (Sorry. I just don't understand?) You eloped to go on vacation but you didn't tie the knot? I think I am just stuck on the operational definition of \"eloped?\") But, regardless, having changed your date by a year to please your SIL, you are no longer obligated to consider anyone else's needs. Get married. CONGRATULATIONS! by the way. I swear its like your SIL is attention starved or something because this is odd AH for someone to pull twice.\n\nAt any rate, it may be time for you to turn the page? A wedding lasts a day. Your marriage should last for the rest of your life. And I would not want the goofy stuff to make me unhappy. Unless you can afford to help broke SIL with the costs of her duties, accept that she can't get blood from a stone and do that graciously.\n\nYour fiance probably just does not want you to hate her sister - even though her sister is clearly a tad self involved? I see both your position and fianc\u00e9's. NAH. You're the only one who will be seen as building a spite fence that lasts for decades. Don't do that. Its not worth it?", "NTA SIL drew first blood, go nuclear of her ass!", "YTA only in terms that your wife is ok with  her sister being there and you could cause a massive rift in your wife's family.\n\nYou are already married to your wife. You are having a vow renewal whilst this is extremely special to you both not everyone else will feel that way as you have been living as a married couple fir a while by the time of the celebration.\n\nSomeone planning their wedding close to yours sucks, been there got the tshirt( had friends have to choose which wedding to go to for cost. ) but it was up to our friends to decide what event was more important. \n\nYounger SIL may feel that since you are already married standing beside her other sister and being part of the legal wedding is more special and doesn't want to miss being part if that for both her sisters.", "If my reading comprehension is working, you eloped, which means you're already married. So you're not planning a \"wedding\" per se, you're planning something more along the lines of a celebration/party aping the performative aspects that come with a wedding.\n\nYour SiL however, \\*is\\* planning an actual wedding. Does it suck that it's so close to your ... whatever? Yes. Is it a bummer that if family have to choose between a formal wedding and your already married because we eloped ... event, so a lot of them may lean toward the real wedding? Yes. Are they wrong for making that choice? No. Is it valid that you're upset? Yes because people can feel how they want.\n\nShould you potentially nuke family/friend relationships by not allowing your SiL to attend your Not Wedding? Absolutely not.\n\n**The problem is you think two comparable events are happening. They are not. You eloped. You are already married. This was you and your partner's choice. The other event \\*is\\* an actual wedding, not a wedding after-the-fact. If I were in your family or friend group, I would go to the actual wedding, because you are already married.**\n\nNAH, but you are edging into AH territory with your attitude. You keep saying \"my wedding\" but what you're actually planning is a celebration event of some kind. It's not the same thing and doesn't have the same weight.", "NTA. The fact is, you moved your ceremony to accommodate her. Then she goes and plans *her* wedding a month before yours, knowing full-well not everyone will be able to attend both? I'd avoid this person going forward. No more accommodations. No more favors. She\u2019s clearly trying to make shit difficult for you--make people \"choose\". The minute she was so inconsiderate about the date after you changed yours, she lost the right to attend.\n\nPeople arguing about \"bUT YoU're ALrEadY MArRiED\". That's literally not the point. Besides, as others have also experienced: my friend got \"married\" at the courthouse before her \"real\" wedding. It was a destination ceremony. Her family is Greek and went back to the island their family is from (there are still all kinds of cousins that live there that they visit occasionally). Because of the difference in forms and stuff, it was literally just *easier* to have the paperwork technically done already in the U.S. But did that mean her ceremony in Greece with her family wasn't a \"real wedding/vow renewal\"? HELL. NO.", "NTA, but it's going to have a negative effect on your marriage. SIL is a massive AH. She clearly did this so that people would have to choose between which event to go to and counted on people choosing hers since it will happen before yours. Still, despite that, she is your wife's sister and unless your wife wants her far away from your ceremony, it will likely cause strife. I'd suggest just canceling yours if the people not being there is really a big deal, but that would likely give SIL a sense of victory, though she will get that no matter what.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's not trying desperately to get other people to force you to come or shame you for saying you can't make it.

Doesn't mean she doesn't respect you, and respect isn't a good reason to ask your wife to uninvite her *sister*.\n\nYTA. Not due to being married already, not for seeming some way about anything, but because this is your wife's sister. You've put your wife in a very tough situation, where she has to tread carefully. If you demand she not be invited, you are ruining a relationship with her family. If you suggested it and honor what your wife decides, your wife has to worry that if she invites her sister, you'll harbor resentment. She can't win here. \n\nYour post didn't make it sound like SIL is always this way, so I'd find it much more likely she's just trying to deal with what she's got. You didn't *have* to move the wedding but you did, just for her. At the time, she wasn't engaged. Now that she is, it's not just her who chooses the date. She was probably also working around family and her SOs family, preferred time of year, etc. It's just bad timing. She's not asking you to change it again, and I get being hurt that she wouldn't change it for you to attend, after you went through so much trouble for her. Perhaps she comes and isn't a bridesmaid, is that the end of the world? Will you be any less happily married? Usually this type of \"don't want someone there who doesn't respect me\" thing looks poorly, because even if it isn't about power, you have no idea how much some of the other guests respect you, or if SIL respects you but isn't very thoughtful.", "Yta.\n\nTake the high road here, it will pay off later.

We were accepted for who we were, and married without a hint of transphobia, homophobia, or any other kind of bigotry.\n\nBy many people's logic, that ceremony wasn't important. We were already married the day before. I'm here to tell all of you that sometimes life, (and outdated, bigoted laws), won't allow you to do the legal part in comfort, if at all. The ceremony, where you can pledge to one another without interference, where you can say your vows without crying bitter tears, where you can focus on the love of your life rather than the law treating you like trash, is the only part worth remembering.\n\n(For those wondering, we are in the UK and married years before the law changed to allow same-sex marriage.

I definitely think she needs to sit down with her partner and SIL and tell her how it has made them feel, and then make the decision on whether she gets to come to the wedding based on that conversation and how SIL handles it", "This is also my stance. Thank you.", "Idk, I probably won\u2019t want someone there who made me push my wedding back a year for them, then deliberately scheduled their wedding to be close enough to mine (and specifically before it) that many family members will have to choose. Unless there\u2019s a really good reason for SIL\u2019s scheduling like a dying grandma and the earliest possible venue date, this might inspire teeth clenching and annoyance every time I looked at her, so no, she\u2019s probably not someone I\u2019d want on the guest list. Since she\u2019s my partner\u2019s sister and my partner wants her there though, I\u2019d probably suck it up though.", "WTF does it matter that they are already married? Are you kidding me with this?", "Actually she wants to disinvite someone who after requesting they move their wedding day once to accommodate her then plans her wedding so close to theirs you just know some people are going to be sorry we can\u2019t attend both. Then she will guilt trip all who turn her down saying theirs doesn\u2019t count because they eloped. Being the sister just makes her worse not a point in her defence for what she did.", "How can you know that? SIL might hate OP.", ">expecting SIL to put her life on hold is also very self entitled\n\nSo\u2026 literally what the sister did to them? For a whole YEAR, and she can\u2019t have the decency to delay hers a couple of months?\nShe knew about all this over a year in advance.", "No she's not. \n\nShe asked (ASKED) if it could be moved the first time. OP and spouse are the one that both agreed and pushed it back a full year. \n\nThen she set her own wedding date. \n\nNothing about that is controlling", "I have no clue why you are getting downvoted for this. \n\nI was in the military. So was my husband. \n\nWe were engaged and trying to stay together and be stationed together. In order for us to be enrolled in the married army couples program we HAD to be married. Engaged means spit all to the army.\n\nSo we snuck out and got hitched at the courthouse. \n\nWe always intended to have a big fluffy wedding but careers, deployments, life got in the way. \n\nA friend of ours was asking us about it and was really bent out of shape that we\u2019d ended up not having a ceremony. Why? Because he said that weddings are about the family and friends of the couple. It\u2019s about allowing those people to gather together and celebrate these two people that they love. \n\nOP has every right to this wedding. And she has every right to expect her SIL to respect their date. There is no way in hell anyone anywhere thinks it\u2019s okay to schedule a wedding a month before another close family member.\n\nThe fact that OP is married means diddly. This is her wedding. She has every right to it and to an expectation that their family not have to choose between two competing ceremonies.\n\nNTA OP\n\nAnd frankly this makes me question the dynamics of your wife\u2019s family. Is the SIL a golden child. Has the expectation always been that she\u2019s a priority? Is this going to continue on during your marriage? Will other family events revolve around the SIL?", "Did SIL ask her to delay it a year though? Or did she ask of it could just not be the same week? That is unclear to me.", "INFO: is this the wedding of the same sister that asked you to push your wedding because of her graduation?", "Wait this is sil 2nd wedding is it the same a renewal or to a different person?", "And also, uninviting an immediate family member from a wedding is a nuclear move. Uninviting an immediate family member from a wedding WITHOUT the couple being on the same page..\n That's a relationship test right there", "I feel its more this is her wife's sister so ultimately its the wife's call. Wife isnt bothered by it so if she did uninvite SIL against her wife's wishes, it would make her an ahole", "So it makes it doubly sucky that she asked them rearranged the event for everyone to celebrate their marriage for her once and now she has arranged hers so other people won't be able to attend. SIL is either stupid or malicious.", "This. Exactly this.\n\nThis is an absolute a hole move by the sister.\n\nI wonder if OP\u2019s wife isn\u2019t upset simply because she\u2019s ALWAYS been expected to accommodate the sister.\n\nI call absolute BS on the sister just slapping her wedding date down a MONTH before OP\u2019s. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sick of these dopey comments claiming it\u2019s no big deal because OP is already married. What utter BS. That had dick all to do with this.", "She wants to disinvite someone her partner wants there.", "SIL didn't ask them to delay it for a whole year, she told them she was graduating from her doctoral program that week and asked if it could be literally any other week, and they chose for it to be pushed back an entire year because the particular date was important to them.", "And what do you really believe the response would have been if they said no?", "I understand still wanting a party if you eloped but what in the world is a fucking engagement if you're already married \ud83e\udd23", "I think that particular comment is downvoted because of the absolutely bonkers nature of wanting an engagement experience AFTER ALREADY BEING MARRIED.", "Nah it\u2019s like they had the ceremony part and now are doing the reception part. But I don\u2019t get the engagement either. Do they mean proposing? That would have already happened. Do they mean an engagement party? Seems unusual to plan that as well as the wedding considering the wedding is happening after the fact so both parties are essentially the same thing", "She asked us to move it, it was ultimately our choice to postpone a whole year as we are wanting the wedding on the same day we eloped.", "So they're not entitled to have a wedding experience?\n\nI did that too. I'm female and my wife is trans, so at the time I couldn't legally marry her without misgendering her in the middle of our wedding vows! We did that part in a registry office, left with a bad taste in our mouths, and held a fantastic, (and non-transphobic), ceremony the next day. When we look back on our wedding, we're looking at that day, not the couple of hours in an office being made to feel like trash.", "Yeah it\u2019s not like any of OPs family will be going to sil\u2019s wedding so none of the \u2018ppl who might not be able to do both\u2019 would be from her side only wife/sil\u2019s and if both of them are fine with family coming or not then why does OP care so much when all her friends/family will be there", "Wouldn't surprise me. Given that she has already insisted they delay the wedding once for her education graduation and then she went and planned her wedding knowing when they scheduled their's for.\n\nI also wouldn't be surprised if this is some sort of passive homophobic power play and that the SIL would then try to claim \"you can't get married around my anniversary, you should just pick a new date entirely.\"\n\nEdit:auto correct errors", "Yes I do. They changed the date they Originally had because of her, for her Doctorate, and she repays them by planning her Wedding one Month before theirs.... ??? I don't blame OP for not wanting Her there. SIL seems to be an \"ALL About Me Me Me\" person. NTA OP.", "Oh she did and OP's wife is so used to bending over backwards to accommodate her sister that she can't see what's happening. OP need to either accept that this is what her marriage will be like or get out of the relationship, because her wife has zero spine when it comes to her family.", "110%", "So? What\u2019s that got to do with anything?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make their ceremony any less important or special.", "True. They chose to elope; they already had their wedding without anyone else there. \n\nI wonder if this has something to do with the SIL\u2019s choice of date \ud83d\udcad", "Malicious", "She has a Doctorate. I'm going with malicious", "Someone who it comes across as being a little disrespectful. I wouldn\u2019t want her there either. I hope would have thought a wedding invite would be 2 yes 1 no deal.", "If it was in short succession, it\u2019d be a wedding. They\u2019ve been married for years at this point\u2026she\u2019s planning a vow renewal.", "They said engagement not a wedding. Also vow renewals are also some people's second/third/etc. Wedding so they weren't saying they couldn't celebrate. Just that the terminology they used wasn't really how most people are going to view it and by definition they don't have an engagement because they're already married.", "This is a risk you took due to that decision, unfortunately. Pushing it an entire year means that more engagements and events will pop up, and other people also have dates and venues and seasons and whatever that they are attached to. There will never be a perfect date that is convenient for all, but do you think the right way to begin a marriage is by telling your wife she can\u2019t invite her sister to the wedding?", "But it would hinder OP\u2019s partners family to attend the wedding, leaving a hole for OP\u2019s partner at the wedding. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an experience OP wants for her partner, or for herself. Weddings are about showcasing love and starting a new family, and now they have to do that without their loved ones there? After they already moved the wedding to accommodate? SIL seems to want to create a separation/chaos with OP and their partner and I think OP and partner need to be mindful of this.", ">I Waldo wouldn't be surprised if this is some sort of passive homophones power play\n\nI know this is autocorrect playing silly bugger but it is unintentionally hilarious.", "If Sil was homophobic, stay sure Op would have mentioned it. Also she had the perfect excuse to avoid being at the wedding. On the contrary she asked for accomodation so that she could participate. Your comment has no base but your own bias.", "Or what about talking to her wife and telling her how she feels and why she feels that way? Not about having SIL at the wedding  hut about the disrespect. It's not necessarily one thing or the other. Perhaps if wife sees OP's point of view and understands her, she'll feel better about SIL being there.", "Simply correcting the commenter on 'how they ought to start' their marriage", "They didn\u2019t already have their wedding. They simply eloped and got married. \n\nThey are now planning their wedding ceremony where they want their family. Ya know - the same family that will now have to choose which ceremony to attend now that SIL put hers a month BEFORE OPs ceremony.", "True but to guests who can't attend both they are going to view it as a choice between a wedding and an anniversary/post-celebration. The initial excitement is long gone by now.", "But it\u2019s not her sister. It\u2019s her wife\u2019s sister. It is an asshole love to try to force your spouse to uninvite their sibling unless it\u2019s a massive issue like they\u2019re a hateful bigot or a sexual predator. Picking an inconvenient wedding date does not meet that threshold.", "> But it would hinder OP\u2019s partners family to attend the wedding, leaving a hole for OP\u2019s partner at the wedding. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an experience OP wants for her partner, or for herself. \n\nOPs partner is fine with it, you\u2019re saying OP should be offended for someone else when they aren\u2019t.\n\n> Weddings are about showcasing love and starting a new family, and now they have to do that without their loved ones there? \n\nWeddings are about being wed which happened years before It\u2019s not a wedding it\u2019s a vowel renewal they are long married for years by then, the \u201cshowcasing love\u201d wasn\u2019t important to have them attend the actual wedding, just like the \u201cstarting a new family\u201d happened then not this party\n\n> After they already moved the wedding to accommodate? SIL seems to want to create a separation/chaos with OP and their partner and I think OP and partner need to be mindful of this.\n\nWhy because someone else has a wedding more than a month before OPs? \nBoth sil and wife are fine with ever family attend or doesn\u2019t attend their events", "You must have seen that in the split second before I edited it. Lol. I'll put in that it was corrected", "I agree! With two children of one family getting married within a month, that\u2019s wicked close together and not really feasible for a lot of the family members. Wedding are expensive with travel plans and gifts and clothes - I would think SIL would have been forever grateful that they already moved their wedding once and would have been mindful of their date when scheduling her own wedding. This is also a horrible way to start a family, so I\u2019d also think SIL would WANT her sister and OP at her wedding and that she could attend theirs. SIL has main character energy and had to have everything go her way.", "If the wedding date was issue 1 I would agree a bit of a d move but that\u2019s all but after requesting previous wedding date moved it shows a pattern.\n\nEdit spelling", "This is it!  I cannot understand having a full on wedding after you have already eloped,  I thought the whole point of eloping is to avoid the wedding day insanity.", "Still though, OP should not get to unilaterally decide to disinvite their wife\u2019s sibling from the wedding, regardless of how their wife feels about it. That\u2019s not how married couples make decisions - not ones with healthy marriages, anyways.", "I also don\u2019t understand people who don\u2019t start their day with coffee but that\u2019s their prerogative. OP previously mentioned that they were kinda in a spot where they had to elope, and had a plan of a wedding at a later date. Life throws all kinds of curveballs at you and it sounds like they\u2019re doing what is best for them, not the \u2018traditional\u2019 way of marriage/wedding. Also fuck traditional and let them be married how they want to be married. I think the issue is SIL isn\u2019t respecting OP and expecting OP to change their life plans so SIL can stay in timeline/live her best life.", "True but like I said really should be a 2 yes 1 no option. To be honest I may be reading too much into it and it may be op\u2019s writing style but to me there is something off about it and I\u2019m more a case of nip it in the bud now rather than put up with it for a long time."]}
