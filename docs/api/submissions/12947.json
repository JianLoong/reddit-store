They were never married and were not common law married due to the fact that they didn\u2019t live together until about 4 months before his passing.\nMyself (22F) and my brother (24M) both have lived on our own for several years before my fathers passing, meaning he could move his girlfriend and her own children (23F & 27M) in without putting a strain on us. Once my father passed we allowed L and her children to remain living in his house on the condition that the bills were still being paid etc. because my father did not have a will, all belonging and property were to be split between myself and my brother. L did not want us touching any of our fathers belongings and refused to let us in the house. The basement had flooding issues that we knew about and offered to help fix, L refused all help and told us that she had it under control. The basement ended up being much worse than she told us, mold growing on the walls and a lot of my fathers possessions were ruined. She ended up changing the locks on the house and moving out without telling us. She also took a lot of my fathers possessions without telling us.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole. \nThere have been articles about my father going around listing L\u2019s children as my fathers children. I never spoke on them when they first came out even though it was very hurtful to read someone else being calling my fathers daughter. Recently there was a new article and I could no longer hold my tongue as everyone was reposting and sharing the article (L and her children have blocked me and refused contact). I posted a lengthy and heartfelt post about how L and her family destroyed my fathers house and stole his belongings all while claiming to be his real family.\nThe post in question said (paraphrasing as it was long) \u201cI do not want to take away how much someone may have loved and cared for my father but to claim him as your own father is incredibly disrespectful after the damage you have caused to his family. You refused help with the basement and let his prized possessions be ruined, things that I could have to remember my father by are now ruined. Please do not speak on my fathers behalf.\u201d\nThis has caused a massive outburst from L and her children, calling me disgusting and saying I should have spoken to them privately first. (Again they have me blocked on most everything). I gave them my reasonings for the post and explained that I have done everything I could to help them while they just took and took from me. \nWhile I believe the post was harsh, and I never in a million years wanted to start Facebook drama(because I think it\u2019s trashy), I believe that it was truthful. I was truly fed up with them spinning this narrative of being the victims.\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1679514987, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yulqa/aita_for_calling_out_my_deceased_dads_girlfriend/", "score": 445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Coming from divorced parents, I also understand the feelings that come along with that as well.  You\u2019re not wrong to tell the truth and to stop playing L\u2019s games.  Even now she sounds unrepentant and wants to continue her bad behaviour.  I\u2019d go ahead and insure she\u2019s no longer able to access the house and perhaps even file a complaint with the police concerning her pillaging your dad\u2019s home.", "NTA even though I feel like there might be some info missing here.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and this messy situation in the middle of your emotional mess.", "NTA\n\nBut if they were together for 18 years, he was around her kids since they were little.

Not for your feelings, which are justified. But for your actions.\n\nBut look at what you said: \"I never in a million years wanted to start Facebook drama\" \u2014 and yet you posted on facebook. A negative (if truthful) post that was inevitably going to start drama. So yeah, you really stepped in it.\n\nYou say you couldn't contact them privately, due to your being blocked. But they could presumably still receive mail. Perhaps now you could send a \"cease and desist\" type letter through a lawyer. I don't know if you can legally get them to stop saying your father is their parent, unless it was being done for fraudulent purposes, but a lawyer would be up on that. And if they did destroy your father's possessions thru neglect, you could consider a lawsuit. Though from what you have written that sounds like it might be more trouble than it's worth.", "ESH. Them for obvious reasons, you for causing the drama despite saying you despise the Facebook drama trash. If you were serious you could have handled everything through legal means. You still can", "NTA. The articles sound weird in the first place. \n\nWhy is it necessary for them to advertise that they are your father's children? Call me paranoid but I feel like they are trying to build supporting evidence to use to contest the will.", "Yes lawyers sound essential", "We have since changed the locks since they vacated to property with no notice. We are in the process of seeing what is salvageable and what is not. Thank you for your response :-)", "Sorry I forgot to add that they do still have contact with their biological father. while I do appreciate the sentiment of seeing my father as a father figure I feel it was gone about in the wrong way.", "Thank you for the response. From all the lawyers I have been in contact with, it seems like a stretch for recovering some of his belongings that she took without proof of his ownership. We could possibly pursue a civil suit for the damages to the property though.", "Unfortunately he was killed in a hit and run case, the articles are about the suspect. But they also talk about my father and quote L\u2019s children as his children.", "How come you guys didn't contact any lawyers to get all the stuff back? And sue her for all the damage?", "Contact the authors of the articles and correct them.", "We have been in touch with lawyers but getting his belongings back is a stretch since we cannot prove his ownership. We have looked into a civil suit for the damages and may take that route.", "We have, it was like talking to a brick wall. They apologized but refused to amend the article.", "I'm really glad that you guys are doing that. I hope luck and law are on your side. NTA Good luck. Keep calling them out. Did she take anything valuable?", "NTA and man, does this one hit close to home in some regards. Currently dealing a similar issue after my uncle's death, his delusional, emotionally abusive ex-wife has been spreading all sorts of nonsense and it really hurts to hear. She's going so far as to contest the will and try to take money from their shared children, as well as steal stuff that didn't even belong to him, it's really vile. I hope it gets better for you!", "NTA, she stole from your father, and she neglected his home. Entitled people these days, make me laugh. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for your loss, I truly hope this situation gets better.", "NTA Honestly the stuff belong to you take them to court to gain all your father passions back", "I'm going to say NTA despite my misgivings about as you termed it \"FB drama\".  They left you no choice.  And taking Dad's thing without discussion is theft.  Sounds like you would have been reasonable had they wanted things with personal meaning to them.", "NTA. But consider lawyering up, she stole from you and your brother and let your father\u2019s home get water damaged, because she refused help to fix it.", "NTA. But y\u2019all need to be involving lawyers if she has locked you all out of the house and  is no longer living in it.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA and I feel like legal action is long since necessary. At the very least, she owes you cost of damages since she did nothing and moved out without telling you.", "Good, I hope you do pursue it. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, hopefully they have some things  of your father\u2019s which you can recover.", "I had this problem when my Son died. I had to get nasty and threaten the writers with lawsuits if they didn't amend the articles. Within 24 hours, there were notices about it being fixed.", "NTA\n\nGet a lawyer", "i lived through almost this exact situation with an ex-MIL in my FIL\u2019s house after he died (obviously a long story). get a lawyer, as fast as possible, and start eviction proceedings, as fast as possible, preferably with an agreement that says you can go to the property before she\u2019s gone to recover any belongings that are left. it gets ugly.", "You are NTA.  There is a greater than 50% chance she deliberately ruined the house and stuff out of spite.  I mean. she's trying to erase you as your father's daughter and swap in her own kid? That's alarming stuff.  \n\nGet lawyers and I pray you had an agreement on paper for her and the house for tenancy.", "YTA for posting that drama online when it needed to stay private. If your father considered her kids his kids, you should respect that.", "NTA but contact a lawyer ASAP", "NTA. If you sued them for theft of your property and repairs, you would also be NTA. You should do that, soon.", "I can't stress enough how important getting a lawyer asap is. OP, you and your brother have been taken advantage of. Please, please get a lawyer. Honestly I am really surprised by all of this. My dad passed in early 2022 unexpectedly without a will. There are strict laws about how things are handled. The estate has to go through probate, etc. I am definitely speaking of my area, I know things can be different elsewhere. I just can't imagine they can be so different that nothing is really done or documented, that there is no process needed to be followed. Protect yourself and your brother.", "Without a will, nobody can lay claim to any of his stuff. Him stating what he wants doesn't legally hold up.", "Please break up the wall of text", "NTA. Do everything every one else has said regarding a lawyer and police reports for theft. But also, if these articles are from reputable sources simply contacting the writer and informing them that they are factually incorrect about your father\u2019s relationships will call for a correction to be issued.", "They've already moved out. OP needs a lawyer to claim damages."]}
