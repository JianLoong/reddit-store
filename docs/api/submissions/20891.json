After the pandemic, I decided it wasn\u2019t a good time to go to grad school, so I got a job bartending. I didn\u2019t want to bartend forever, and I wasn\u2019t ready for more schooling. So one of regulars told me they owned a commercial construction company and offered me a job. I decided to take them up on their offer.\n\n\nI started as a commercial project manager, at a higher salary than I\u2019ve ever made before. Things went pretty well for about 6 months. I got a raise, made friends with everyone I was very good at my job. I started to hear rumors about the guy I work for. He\u2019s been to prison for various different financial crimes, ranging from embezzlement to wire fraud. I didn\u2019t have any issues up until this point, and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. \n\n\nI was managing a commercial build for a client in another state. This would require me to visit the site frequently. Keep in mind this is a multi-million dollar project. The first red flag was when I did my first site visit. Everything is supposed to be paid for upfront, but there was an issue with the rental car. So I paid. Of course, it was a huge fight to get my money back. Again, decided not to jump to conclusions. I should also mention that I personally have brought in just over half a million in pay to the company. Fast forward a month, applications are due for subcontracts. I process and approve all of them. \n\n\nX comes back to me and points out the small errors, none of which should hold up paying these people. I just tell myself he\u2019s being cautious and wants to make sure everything is above board. The payments we owed totaled something along the lines of $200,000. Much less than the amount I\u2019ve brought in. We\u2019re supposed to pay our contractors 30 days after they apply for payment. I was told that all checks had gone out, and so I passed that information along. two weeks later no one\u2019s been paid yet. I do some digging and find out that not a single check has been sent. This really concerned me but owner had plenty of valid reasons on why it hadn\u2019t been done. \n\n\nAround the same time, I found out that owner is having a pool with outdoor kitchen and deck installed at their house. I ask about checks and am told they are being sent out today. Fast forward another week, still nothing. I morally cannot work for a company like this so I furnished my resignation. When I did this, owner calls me and promises that they will get the checks in the mail that night. Doesn\u2019t matter to me as I\u2019ve made up my mind but I decided to stay because I wanted to make sure the people I hired were being taken care of. So the next day I get shipping information for the checks that are supposed to go out. On the label, it says the checks won\u2019t be shipped for an additional week. I quit on the spot and walked out. I cannot and will not work for a company that does shady stuff.
