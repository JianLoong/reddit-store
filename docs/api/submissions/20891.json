After the pandemic, I decided it wasn\u2019t a good time to go to grad school, so I got a job bartending. I didn\u2019t want to bartend forever, and I wasn\u2019t ready for more schooling. So one of regulars told me they owned a commercial construction company and offered me a job. I decided to take them up on their offer.\n\n\nI started as a commercial project manager, at a higher salary than I\u2019ve ever made before. Things went pretty well for about 6 months. I got a raise, made friends with everyone I was very good at my job. I started to hear rumors about the guy I work for. He\u2019s been to prison for various different financial crimes, ranging from embezzlement to wire fraud. I didn\u2019t have any issues up until this point, and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. \n\n\nI was managing a commercial build for a client in another state. This would require me to visit the site frequently. Keep in mind this is a multi-million dollar project. The first red flag was when I did my first site visit. Everything is supposed to be paid for upfront, but there was an issue with the rental car. So I paid. Of course, it was a huge fight to get my money back. Again, decided not to jump to conclusions. I should also mention that I personally have brought in just over half a million in pay to the company. Fast forward a month, applications are due for subcontracts. I process and approve all of them. \n\n\nX comes back to me and points out the small errors, none of which should hold up paying these people. I just tell myself he\u2019s being cautious and wants to make sure everything is above board. The payments we owed totaled something along the lines of $200,000. Much less than the amount I\u2019ve brought in. We\u2019re supposed to pay our contractors 30 days after they apply for payment. I was told that all checks had gone out, and so I passed that information along. two weeks later no one\u2019s been paid yet. I do some digging and find out that not a single check has been sent. This really concerned me but owner had plenty of valid reasons on why it hadn\u2019t been done. \n\n\nAround the same time, I found out that owner is having a pool with outdoor kitchen and deck installed at their house. I ask about checks and am told they are being sent out today. Fast forward another week, still nothing. I morally cannot work for a company like this so I furnished my resignation. When I did this, owner calls me and promises that they will get the checks in the mail that night. Doesn\u2019t matter to me as I\u2019ve made up my mind but I decided to stay because I wanted to make sure the people I hired were being taken care of. So the next day I get shipping information for the checks that are supposed to go out. On the label, it says the checks won\u2019t be shipped for an additional week. I quit on the spot and walked out. I cannot and will not work for a company that does shady stuff.

Your integrity is worth more than whatever monetary value this owner is holding onto. There\u2019s nothing admirable in sinking with the ship. Swim far far away from this sinker", "NTA\n\nYou definitely don\u2019t want to be caught in the fallout over this. \n\nYou did your due diligence. Time to CYA.", "NTA. Did you work for Donald Trump?! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  This is going to blow up in the company\u2019s face and you\u2018re better off leaving that mess behind.", "INFO, from someone who works in the industry please hear me out.  \n\nI'm trying to figure out the time line here, its reads that you processed the payments and waited two weeks, no payments. Waited another week and furnished your resignation. Then the checks were dated for the week after that? If thats all true, I'm going to be honest that seems like a relatively quick payment for the industry. \n\nConstruction companies can get very \"sticky\" with money they send out right around this time of year. Around this time of year companies have spent a lot of money on payroll and materials and often have only received one payment from the client, if at all. As a sub contractor I absolutely never expect to see a cent until the GC has been paid, and after that it will take weeks to turn around. You confirmed your company has been paid for the work, correct? \n\nNot saying this makes the industry \"right\" or that your boss isn't scummy, just saying that this may be something you consider looking for new jobs. If the situation is as you describe, it will likely repeat most places you go", "NTA Any owner who would cheat clients, would cheat their employees in a minute. Be glad you got out before that owner cheated you.", "I agree and appreciate your feedback. My issue isn\u2019t with leaving the company, but rather leaving the people I\u2019ve hired to fight on their own. I feel indirectly responsible and therefore feel as though I have an obligation to see this job to the end.", ">A company/employer that screws their contractors over will have no issue screwing YOU over if they felt like doing it.\n\nThe boss was already doing it in a small way. Evidenced by the issue with the rental car not being pre-paid and OP having to fight to get the expense reimbursed.\n\nThe owner was probably trying to see if OP would just eat the cost of the rental. Because, if OP did, it would tell the boss they could get away with screwing them even more.", "I don't think the owner is going to pay OP regardless of a contract based on the whole not sending checks and clearly using the money himself.", "Thank you for the feedback. I agree. Just feels wrong to let people I brought aboard sink cuz they have no choice \u2026 but self preservation is paramount here.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 as I typed this I thought the same thing", "I remember when he originally ran for office, in the IBEW newsletter that circulates monthly, there were statements that Trump/et al were notorious for refusing to pay their construction bills. That was part of why I did not vote for him. He and his cronies activity took food off the tables of families while he schmoozed and did his thing. Some of those contractors went bankrupt waiting for payment. And I know of far too many members of unions who support that individual. Like....how does one reconcile the values you pledge to respect when you sign on with a union then support the candidate who has breached contracts with your fellow union members?", "Completely understand however I should clarify: I waited two weeks AFTER waiting the 30 days we have to pay. So in total, it was 6 weeks. Then an additional week and then checks dated for another additional week so it\u2019s 8 weeks total. And yes, I personally have verified the draws have been received.", "If you want to actually help them out tell them to get ready to sue and go after the guy as well as the company.  Those checks aren\u2019t getting sent out.", "That\u2019s up to you.  I feel you owe nothing to the boss.  Maybe help the guys on your team who are left behind by helping them find jobs elsewhere?  They\u2019ll likely all be unemployed soon anyways so a head start there would be the play in my opinion.", "You need to protect yourself first, but if you want to protect others you have to report this guy.    \nIm not sure what your options are where you are, but I would contact whoever is insuring the job site/holds the surety bond, because they might investigate. Maybe contact OSHA or someone to anonymously report you think corners are being cut and safety is at risk, because I maybe there is more going on than just a few late checks. And I'd collect whatever documentation on the checks and lies that you have and report him to whatever government entity would investigate financial crimes, because this sounds like embezzlement.\nI'd check with a lawyer about what you can say because there may be a risk of slander or libel charges, but do what you can to warn your employees. I think your sudden departure will say plenty on its own, but you don't want to start telling people about problems and start something you can't take back if you're wrong.", "Very true. It\u2019s like he\u2019s testing me to see how far I can be pushed. He also asked me to apply for licensing, which I did. I am not qualified for said license, which I made clear. All in all he spent around $5000 in paying for books, exams, fees, etc. I got denied because of my lack of qualifications, now he\u2019s pissed I won\u2019t lie on my application to get the license because \u201che\u2019s invested so much\u201d into it.", "He has a history of not paying people what they are owed when they quit. I\u2019m expecting that. It\u2019s a calculated risk at this point", "Is everyone else is aware of the situation? Regardless, I\u2019m sure your prompt resignation was a hint? I\u2019m not an expert on the correct course of action when reporting this misconduct (considering he\u2019s the owner\u2013no one to report him to internally) but any kind of whistleblower report would blow this wide open and hopefully protect those remaining employees from any liability and wrongdoing. Severance payouts with the leftovers! I think there\u2019s a statute of limitations on these kinds of reports so any and all proof you have that shows you\u2019re not responsible for damages goes a long way", "Ah that changes things a bit, NTA. June and May suck in construction for this but you're not wrong to feel uncomfortable with it", "Ughhhh... even more reason to get out of there.\n\nIf the boss is willing to lie or have you lie on a licensing application, there is no telling what other lies he's willing to do or have done.\n\nNever lie on that sort of application. Any negative fallout from getting caught would land on you, first and foremost.\n\nAnd if he tries to push for you to pay him back, talk to a lawyer, but he likely doesn't have a leg to stand on. If you made it clear upfront that you lacked needed qualifications, and he paid anyway, that's on him. Especially if he paid expecting that you'd lie.", "Nope NTA.\n\n\n\nBut CYA", "No you're not\nIf he does this, the company will absolutely go down and you with it.

Establish that you were not the issue and that it was the boss. This can incredibly quickly become your boss bad mouthing you about stealing money and holding up payments and destroying your name amongst lots of employers and companies.\n\nI don't know how the industry works where you are but you can also consider reporting them to a regulatory body and saying you're worried about how money was handled.", "NTA.", "Be very, VERY careful here.  Now that you've quit, he's got someone to blame (even if it's not true) when things go south.  Make sure you have as much documentation as you can get, and it might not hurt to meet with your state commerce department proactively.  Blowing a whistle might give you some protection if he decides to point the finger at you later.  He dragged you down to his level.  Don't let him beat you with experience.
