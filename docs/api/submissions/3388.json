{"id": 3388, "submission_id": "z6goqx", "title": "AITA for following family tradition?", "selftext": "My relatives and I always go to our family cabin for Thanksgiving. This year, I brought along my fianc\u00e9, Kat, for the first time to celebrate with my family. \n\nWhen visiting the cabin, my family has a rule that only one guest/person who isn\u2019t related to the family is allowed to come. This is a compromise because we only have enough chairs at the for each member of the family. So each year, one person doesn\u2019t get a seat at the table. So we play a round of musical chairs to the song Jingle Bells, and the whoever loses doesn\u2019t get to sit at the table. \n\nWe can\u2019t buy more chairs for the table or move more another chair to the table because we stick to tradition keep the cabin the same to honor my dead great uncle who originally bought the cabin. We do have a chair that whoever loses musical chairs can sit in\u2014 it\u2019s just not at the table. The chair is a child-sized time-out chair facing the corner that my cousins and I used to have to sit in as punishment when we were younger. \n\nWhoever loses musical chairs sits in the punishment chair and wears a dunce cap (ironically) while they eat. \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to bring my fianc\u00e9 along to Thanksgiving in past years but I was never able to because of the blood relative rule. But this year it was finally my turn.  I didn\u2019t tell my fianc\u00e9 in advance about my family\u2019s tradition because I didn\u2019t want to scare her off and there are 18 family members who come, so i figured there was only a pretty small chance that she would be the one who lost musical chairs. \n\nUnfortunately, Kat lost musical chairs.  \n\nKat is usually pretty easygoing and doesn\u2019t make a fuss, so I didn\u2019t anticipate this being such a big deal. But when Kat lost and found out she looked at me incredulously. I brought her plate over to the punishment chair and jokingly gave her the (ironic) dunce hat. \n\nShe asked me if I was seriously going to make her sit in the corner by herself for Thanksgiving. I told her it wasn\u2019t my call and that it was just a silly (ironic) tradition and asked her to just sit there as a favor to me and I\u2019d make it up to her later, but Kat just left. We had carpooled so I had no way of getting home after this. \n\nOnce I got home Kat had packed her stuffed up and left to live with her parents. It\u2019s been a few days now and she still won\u2019t respond to my calls.

Actually your whole family are AHs.  This is a stupid tradition and if you think excluding someone from the table honors your great uncle, maybe he was an AH too.  In any case, the guest should be exempt from musical chairs.  And what do they do when more people join the family by marriage, or when new children come into the family?  \n\nAt the very least, when Kat got caught out, you should have given her your seat at the table and taken the dunce chair.  Which you deserve for bringing her into such a stupid family tradition with no warning!", "YTA and so is your family.  That\u2019s a truly terrible way to \u201cwelcome\u201d someone to the family.  Family traditions should end if they start hurting people.\n\nMy husband\u2019s family had a Christmas tradition of throwing new partners into a snowbank the first time they joined for the holiday.  It was supposedly all in good fun and the target took it with good humor until it came to me.  I\u2019m physically disabled, and my disability gets worse and more painful if I get cold.  So throwing me in a snowbank was going to hurt me (and honestly, be rather embarrassing - it\u2019s a bigger struggle for me to right myself if I\u2019m on the ground than for a healthy person).  So my husband had a word with his mother, and she warned her brothers (who were the enthusiastic proponents of this tradition) about what the results of throwing me in the snow would be.  That was 2010, and ended up being the end of the tradition, because it made them think about the fact that other people might simply not want to be thrown in the snow like that.\n\nObviously your family\u2019s tradition is only isolation and shaming and not risk of injury and physical pain, but you\u2019re still risking treating the newest family member to a nasty surprise.  If your family insists on keeping this tradition, there\u2019s an easy modification that will make it okay again: set aside 1 normal chair as the \u201cnew person\u201d chair, and have only the blood relations play musical chairs to get a seat.  That way, you don\u2019t risk excluding the person who is joining the family, but you can still have your game.", "WTF. Yes, YTA. I cannot blame her for leaving. You should have, at a minimum, given her your chair. But no, it would not be disrespecting your late uncle to bring a folding chair or buy some new chairs. Families grow. That said, I\u2019d predict that Kat may be thinking long and hard about not being part of the growth in yours.", "YTA and enjoy the single life dude\u2026 because you got dumped and deservedly so!", "YTA and so is your family\n\nYou all need to let this tradition die. What's the point of being together if you ALL can't actually be together and enjoy a meal. You and your family absolutely can buy more chairs. You all are just too cheap.", "This post can't be real lmao", "YTA.   \nIs this for real? Would your great uncle really be so butt hurt at the addition of a new chair that he'd feel it was dishonoring him? Why would you want to honor such a person?\n\nAnyway, it's incredibly rude to make a guest sit separate from the family and shame them. It's a silly tradition to your family because you grew up with it. But this is a guest, who you are supposed to make feel welcome. At the very least, you should have switched places with her.", "Impressive foresight by your great uncle to know how many people would be in the family two generations after him. And what about other partners/ spouses - not blood relatives - how have they managed to overcome this insurmountable chair problem over the years? \nYTA - for lots of reasons!", "YTA\n\nTheres nothing wrong with goofy traditions. My family has one where we sing Happy Birthday out of tune and timing so it's just a bunch of people yelling. We all have fun and laugh and its super fun for us. \n\nThe issue is not telling someone that beforehand. If you sat her down and explained it all to her, she might have seen the light-heartedness to it. She might have been on board. Instead, you threw her in the deep end and put her in a corner away from everyone else. I told my partner before he experiences it for the first time so he knew to be prepared. It's common courtesy so they don't feel out of the loop or feel attacked.\n\nAlso, no shame, but surely someone can bring a camp chair and take it with them. I'm Australian so don't do Thanksgiving, but I know there's a BUNCH of food, so sitting in a too-small chair made for children with a plate on your lap seems cruel, rather than fun.", "This one is easy.  YTA.  Your family's tradition is absurd and not telling her about it amounts to it being an ambush.\n\nShe was coming to the cabin for you and you let her down.", "YTA\n\n> I didn\u2019t tell my fianc\u00e9 in advance about my family\u2019s tradition because I didn\u2019t want to scare her off \n\nAnd why do you think it would scare her off? Is it because this is a bad tradition that a reasonable self-respecting person would not agree to? \n\nVery obviously the AH. I would leave too. I hate being forced into things without my consent and infantilized, a good partner would never do this. \n\nIf she leaves you, you will deserve it.", "YTA.  Honoring your great uncle by making a first-time guest sit in a corner and wear a dunce cap is a lousy way to honor your great uncle.  Hang his picture.

There are so many way to honor him without this nonsense.", "YTA.. What a horrible thing to do. Buy a bloody chair so your next fiance won't have to sit in the corner.", "YTA, 100%. You made your fianc\u00e9 sit by herself in the corner on thanksgiving. She should dump you.", "YTA, I understand keeping the tradition but as a guest she should've defaulted to sitting at the family table and the tradition should just be amongst the cousins or you should have volunteered to take her place. Once she was comfortable with your family in a year or two then maybe she could also join in, but to spring it on her when she's already freaking out about a large Thanksgiving party introduction is not the time.", "YTA \n\nYou could have told her. You chose not to tell her. You choose not to show her basic decency.

You\u2019re also TA for essentially telling her to suck it up and deal with it because it\u2019s just a \u201csilly little tradition.\u201d \n\nHopefully staying with her parents (or finding a new home) becomes permanent. She deserves better.", "OP AND FAMILY YTA\n\n As a guest  they should be exempt from this stuiped tradition.   All this  tradition does is hurt people.. I would  of left as well.

YTA.", "YTA. This is literally using the word \u201ctradition\u201d to justify bullying perceived outsiders.

If I was your fianc\u00e9 and you didn\u2019t stand up for me to your crappy family, I would reconsider the relationship.", "YTA. This tradition is horrible and stupid. So only blood related people can come? Which means every year, how many spouses/significant others are left out?!?! What about if anyone has kids?? I feel bad for anyone joining your family and finding out this is how they act. I would refuse to attend another thanksgiving, and would\u2019ve reacted the same way as your fianc\u00e9.

If she decided she wasn't comfortable with that tradition and didn't want to attend, that should have been her choice.\n\nAlso this tradition is horrible. I get it if someone has to sit off to the side, but could still participate in conversation, but her being forced to sit alone in the corner, while everyone else is like \"don't worry, it's funny, it's ironic\" is so awful. Good on her for leaving. YTA", "YTA. If tradition is so important to you, you\u2019d have sat in the corner with the dunce cap in her place.  Of course she doesn\u2019t want to marry into your family now. Who would?", "YTA.  Do you not understand how nasty and humiliating this was.? And don't use \"family tradition\" as an excuse.  You could have volunteered to sit in the little chair to spare her, but oh no, being kind and generous would violate your family tradition.  The fact that you do this to one another doesn't make it acceptable.  Buy another damned chair and crowd around the table.  Hopefully, one day, you'll develop a bit more insight and empathy, see beyond your family's pathetic excuse for a tradition, and you'll have another fiancee to sit next to you.

This has to be fake. It has to be. \n\nIf by some chance this actually happened, you and your family are weird and unwelcoming af. And I wouldn't expect Kat to return your calls any time soon.

You ruined her thanksgiving. Her first thanksgiving with your family to boot too.", "YTA and this tradition is also the asshole.

Family traditions are only fun if everybody wants to participate.", "YTA, well actually your family is the AH to have this silly tradition. I understand emotional nostalgia and stuff, but it is a pretty cruel one, which I doubt your late great uncle would have even approved off.

What a great way to make the ONE non-family guest feel included /s\n\nYTA. If your family wants to continue this (weird) tradition, then the guest should be excluded from playing.", "YTA, good news is I doubt you'll ever have the issue of not having a chair for her again because women rarely go to dinner with their ex-fianc\u00e9s.", "Uh, yeah....you were wrong.

And why is the musical chairs tradition not limited to blood family only?  There\u2019s so much stupid in this post I don\u2019t have words. Who would want to marry into this group of morons?  So unless you\u2019re inbred this means that either your mother or father have to take turns attending a family thanksgiving?  Again, so stupid.", "YTA, and so is your family/this tradition that is made to embarrass who ever loses. It's not a tradition, it's humiliation. And you didn't even warn her?

You are using both words wrong. (Silly would be is the dunce cap had bells or the person sitting there got to eat pie first. Ironic would be if the person wearing the dunce cap was in fact the king/queen of the day and got to boss everyone around. This is just....mean.)\n\nSecond,  for gods sake buy more chairs.

This year, I brought along my fianc\u00e9, Kat, for the first time to celebrate with my family. \n\nWhen visiting the cabin, my family has a rule that only one guest/person who isn\u2019t related to the family is allowed to come. This is a compromise because we only have enough chairs at the for each member of the family. So each year, one person doesn\u2019t get a seat at the table. So we play a round of musical chairs to the song Jingle Bells, and the whoever loses doesn\u2019t get to sit at the table. \n\nWe can\u2019t buy more chairs for the table or move more another chair to the table because we stick to tradition keep the cabin the same to honor my dead great uncle who originally bought the cabin. We do have a chair that whoever loses musical chairs can sit in\u2014 it\u2019s just not at the table. The chair is a child-sized time-out chair facing the corner that my cousins and I used to have to sit in as punishment when we were younger. \n\nWhoever loses musical chairs sits in the punishment chair and wears a dunce cap (ironically) while they eat. \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to bring my fianc\u00e9 along to Thanksgiving in past years but I was never able to because of the blood relative rule. But this year it was finally my turn.  I didn\u2019t tell my fianc\u00e9 in advance about my family\u2019s tradition because I didn\u2019t want to scare her off and there are 18 family members who come, so i figured there was only a pretty small chance that she would be the one who lost musical chairs. \n\nUnfortunately, Kat lost musical chairs.  \n\nKat is usually pretty easygoing and doesn\u2019t make a fuss, so I didn\u2019t anticipate this being such a big deal. But when Kat lost and found out she looked at me incredulously. I brought her plate over to the punishment chair and jokingly gave her the (ironic) dunce hat. \n\nShe asked me if I was seriously going to make her sit in the corner by herself for Thanksgiving. I told her it wasn\u2019t my call and that it was just a silly (ironic) tradition and asked her to just sit there as a favor to me and I\u2019d make it up to her later, but Kat just left. We had carpooled so I had no way of getting home after this. \n\nOnce I got home Kat had packed her stuffed up and left to live with her parents. It\u2019s been a few days now and she still won\u2019t respond to my calls. Aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I seriously doubt a couple of extra folding chairs or camping chairs for guests would have offended. \n\nIf I even thought about excluding a guest like that (forget shaming them with the dunce cap), my mother would have me by my ears like a toddler - because that's the level of manners I'd be showing.

Poor Kat", "Agreed, this is just so low effort and stupid.", "What is this comment lol", "Yeah like surely this cannot be real.", "Or maybe tried a bit harder than 18 other people at musical chairs cuz come one\u2026. There had to be someone in their 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s she surely could have beaten \u2026.

Sure, I have some traditions that involve us laughing at family and being borderline mean to each other (The traditional burning of the biscuits, since my mom ALWAYS burned the biscuits, for example. We ALWAYS called attention to it.)\n\nHowever, it's the not telling her that pisses me off! Traditions are family behaviors that often have history for that family and is a good way to learn the familial culture, which sometimes can make them feel like assholes depending on the tradition, but people should NOT be ambushed into it and laughed at when they are clearly not part of the joke! If she has CHOSEN to go there and be part of this tradition and was a sore loser, I'd say fine, while OP would still be TA because the tradition itself is a bit assholish, but Kat knew exactly what she was getting into and chose to partake willingly.\n\nYTA, 100% and I cannot imagine deceiving my fiancee like this just to get a laugh at her expense...", "I agree!  All but Kat are total AHs!!  If one or more of the chairs breaks, does that mean that the chairs won\u2019t be replaced?!

As somebody with abandonment issues and trouble attending family gatherings because they were a source of trauma when in foster care, and then in my adoptive home and again when I was abandoned back into foster care, this would have been extremely difficult for me to take without any kind of warning.", "She didn\u2019t even know the tradition and she was just supposed to get there and sit alone for thanksgiving meal while everyone (family) sat at a big table laughing and enjoying their family time? Maybe you can be the new fianc\u00e9e, because it looks like his former one is out the door. \ud83d\ude02\nOP, YTA.

Is this something your great-uncle would have even wanted? What the actual sweet fuck is wrong with your family? Why did you not feel even an ounce of shame over how you treated the woman you promised to love and cherish above all others? \n\nYou're all tremendous assholes. Hopefully you learn and grow from this for your next relationship.", "Well if you don't want to repeat this particular issue, make sure to tell the next girlfriend you have about the tradition before you bring her up for this awful mess.", "You care more about a game of musical chairs than you do your poor fianc\u00e9 \n\nThere is a reason she's not calling you back.\n\nEnjoy being single again!  And be sure to put that musical chair bit in your dating profile, I'm sure you'll get a TON of women interested in a family like yours.", "Well, that's not going to be the case here soon.

That said, I would think we wouldn't include someone joining for the very first time, nor make them sit apart if they clearly didn't want to.

Possibly sadistic...", "You're a pretty cruel man also.  Just like your uncle.  YTA", "You wrote all that out, and this comment, and still question if indeed you are TA? Dude, you're single now.

YTA", "So he was a pretty cruel man yet you're all honoring him? Not only honoring him, but the way you choose to honor him is to keep the cabin exactly the same so you can't even buy a bigger table and new chairs? Are you kidding me? So one poor person has to sit alone in a corner in a child's chair no less? It isn't only your uncle who was cruel, you and your whole family are cruel, and frankly nuts. I also find it hard to believe this hasn't been a problem until now. No one in your family has gotten married or has kids over the years? It's hard to believe relatives would be dying at the same rate as people getting married or having kids. Or have some of your family smartened up, are not cruel people, and don't go to the cabin for the holidays? Perhaps you should follow their example if you don't want to be single the rest of your life.", "It's not \"\"ironic\"\" if the loser has to *really* isolate themself and *really* wear an insulting hat.\n\nAlso cruel traditions are\u2026 cruels.
