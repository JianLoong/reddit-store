Better be quick before I get attached to this new avatar and name.\r  \n\r  \nThe family went to a waterpark; everything was great until the last ride. It was a two-person raft ride; I took my 8yo while my husband went in a different line with the older child. I have keratoconus and I wasn't wearing my glasses because I don't wear them on rides.

After 5 other pairs came down without my husband and other child arriving, the cast member asked my daughter and I if we wanted to go again, since there wasn't a waiting line at the moment. My 8yo said yes, because we had agreed it was our favorite ride of the day, and I (mistakenly, apparently) said okay, as we should arrive right behind my husband and other child since the short line moved so quickly.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we went down the slide around 5 minutes later and emerged, my husband and older child were not there. We waited for a moment, as I didn't know how long their line was, and then I suggested we wait a little longer because maybe they got in line a second time as well.\r  \n\r  \nWe waited and waited, and I finally had my 8yo start looking to see if there were other parties coming down for a second time, which would show my husband and other child couldn't possibly be in line anymore.\r  \n\r  \nWe even watched a child get stuck in one of the slides and have to get rescued, which was another reason why I extended the wait time.\r  \n\r  \nMy 8yo, at one point, asked if I thought they had gone back to the chair, and I said \"Your dad knows I can't see, he wouldn't leave me.\"\r  \n\r  \nAfter enough time had passed that it felt definitely wrong for them not to have arrived, I finally conceded we should go look at the beach chair and had my 8yo help lead the way back.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we arrived, my older child was there and said they'd left the slide a while ago; when my husband arrived from the bathroom and I asked him why he left me when he knew I couldn't see, he absolutely erupted at me.

He said IATA who left the landing area, so I am the one who left first and not him.\r  \n\r  \nI apologized for taking the second ride without waiting for him first and insisted he understand how dangerous it was to leave me in a crowded area when I was severely visually impaired. I told him to look through my glasses and tell me how to tell the colorful blobs apart from farther than 5 to 3 feet. He told me I was being hysterical and was an embarrassment. He told me to ask everyone and they would tell me IATA.

Because this is highly disturbing, verbally abusive shit.", "ESH, based on your word here.\n\nI admit your writing style annoys me, and I'm trying not to let that influence me. But while your husband sucks for calling you \"an asshole, an embarrassment, idiotic and insane\" (seriously, that's horrible, who talks to the person they love like that?), didn't you both agree you would each take a child on the ride? Didn't you then make the choice to do it again after barely waiting for your husband? And when that causes a problem that isn't really a problem, *then* you claim it was his fault because - he shouldn't have agreed to leave you with your child in the first place? Even though that's what you both wanted?\n\nHe is not to blame for the kerfuffle at the water park. Really, you aren't either - these things happen, and it sounds like it was no big deal. But while his words to you are despicable, your blaming him makes you the asshole too.", "... I want to say Esh because you did cause the whole ordeal by going back around. He has no way of knowing you went for another go, and given it sounds like 8yo is able to guide you it doesn't seem strange to me that he went looking for you at the chair instead of expecting you to appear behind him when you weren't at the landing zone. So the \"he wouldn't leave me\" and the accusation as soon as he returned seems out of line to me\n\nBut the immediate eruption to yelling is such an over reaction that it feels like something else has to be going on there", "The ugly things your husband said to you are inexcusable.  His hostility and aggressiveness in front of your children and in public are the video you could put next to \"asshole\" in the pictorial dictionary of husbands must like to be justifiably dumped.\n\nHis leaving you there was not a misunderstanding.  Yes, you went on the ride twice, which could have confused him.  But what he does is that situation is wait.  The fact that he was sitting around not even slightly concerned about you would suggest that he far exceeds the level of uncaring that one should accept in a spouse.\n\nAnd he thinks that *you're* the embarrassment?  Tel him to guess again.  \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nI would have said he was somewhat of an AH for leaving you, but his explosive reaction makes him a massive AH.\n\nIn a marriage it\u2019s important to be able to say when something goes wrong.  Now he is trying to teach you that you cannot speak about anything that is critical of him - because you will fear his explosive defensiveness.  \n\nWhat does he think that will do to the intimacy of your marriage?  Will never being able to question his judgement or talk about problems bring your closer? Make you feel cherished by him? Make you trust him? Make you feel like he cares about you?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. His type of explosive defensiveness makes me think he only loves himself.  Not great for a marriage.", "Wow.  Is your husband ALWAYS emotionally and verbally abusive, or just in front of your kids, while in a public amusement park?   NTA.", "NTA.  Your husband with the working eyes didn\u2019t think to recheck the landing spot?  He was a huge AH!", "NTA it's not your fault you have a disability and need extra help. I'm sorry your husband was an ass about it.", "INFO: did you explicitly agree to meet at the bottom of the slide after you each rode?", "NTA What\u2019s wrong with your husband? A normal person would have said \u201cI thought you and 8yo must\u2019ve gone back to the chair bc you weren\u2019t at the landing area when we came down.\u201d But no. He KNEW you went on another run. He thinks his time is entirely too valuable to wait on anyone. How dare you go again without asking permission?!! He\u2019ll show you: he\u2019s leaving you there! That ought to remind you of how much you need him!\n\nAnd then to publicly berate you when you called him on his bad behavior? He thinks YOU deserve to be called names? Does he recognize that he\u2019s abusive?\n\nPlease be very clear. Your husband is a colossal AH. Everyone reading this thinks he\u2019s a sub-par husband and father, and we\u2019re all sorry that you married this AH.", "ESH you knew you have this disability and still got back in line which led your husband assume you left.\n\nHe was also a  AH for responding as aggressively as he did.", "NTA, but you definitely picked a winner. /s\nYour husband is an ass.", "NTA. Your husband is the AH mainly for berating you in public. The first incident could be chalked up to a simple misunderstanding but why do you allow him to berate & call you names?? Extra AH points to him for doing so in front of your kids. He\u2019s a sniveling, callous hothead.", "NTA. Unless there\u2019s something else we dont know, he seems to have had an insane overreaction. Now, you clearly did get back to the chair in one piece, so it seems you were ok but still. You had a plan and didn\u2019t follow it", "NTA\n\nAnd it's honestly because of his response to you when you brought it up. I can see there being a bit of ambiguity but that is no reason to lose his temper. He could have said he thought you'd be okay since you left first and then if he really had a problem with you leaving, ask you to not leave without him again. But that's it. It's really not that difficult to have an adult conversation.", "NTA.\nIt seems like you could have potentially communicated a little more clearly to him that you would need for the whole group to go back to the chairs at the same time. However, it does seem like you waited a while for him, and it's odd how he wouldn't wonder where you and you child were after all that time. Also... Your husband sounds like an ableist asshole. You do not deserve to be talked to like that, and the way you describe the way he talked to you can also have a negative effect on your kids if they witness this. You might want to rethink your relationship, especially if he's erupted at you in a similar manner more than once.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I normally have scleral lenses in and handle most everything there is to handle for the family. It is unusual for me to actually be submerged within my impairment.

From my perspective, my need should stand out because it normally isn't there, but I suppose I can understand how it could be forgotten.\n\nAs far as how he speaks to me, it is not, unfortunately, that unusual lately.

One of my besties, my soul sister, has a serious degenerative eye condition that has gotten progressively worse over the years.  She had three little boys and a husband like yours.   Her biggest concern was obviously caring for herself and making a living, while raising her boys.  The biggest eye-opener (no pun intended) came for her after her husband did something similar and berated and verbally abused her in front of her sons.  She realized that she didn\u2019t want to raise her sons to think that this was an acceptable way to treat a woman.  She divorced him and was able to build a successful business (that she still works in, despite being now severely visually impaired).   She remarried to an amazingly incredible and supportive man and had several wonderful years until he passed suddenly last year.   I was super concerned when he passed because I know he did take on a caregiving role, despite her incredible independence.  Despite my concerns, she continues to grow and thrive and surprise me (and her three sons, who are now young adults) with her incredible resilience.  You DON\u2019T deserve to be treated this way and you deserve better, friend.  Your husband knows exactly what he is doing and it\u2019s horrible and abusive.  And most importantly, your sons need to have a good role model for how women should be respected, and your husband isn\u2019t it.

But even if it doesn't escalate, verbal abuse on its own is enough for you to seriously reconsider this marriage.
