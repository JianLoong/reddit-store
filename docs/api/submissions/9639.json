Now after we've been together for two years I realise that I wanted to be engaged sooner.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have talked about this and he says he would rather be living together before we get engaged. I respect his decision and how he feels which is why I bought myself a ring.\n\nIt wasn't expensive and I used my own money to pay for it. It makes me feel more secure in my relationship so I don't understand why my boyfriend is upset about me buying a cheap ring.\n\nI told my boyfriend he controls when he proposes and I can wait two more years, but he doesn't get to control what jewellery I buy myself and where I wear it. So Aita?.\n\nEdit for everyone asking what I meant by \"more secure in my relationship\". I meant it keeps unwanted attention away even though the ring is cheap and I bought it off etsy.

That doesn\u2019t even make sense", "INFO\n\nWhy did you buy the ring exactly?", "YTA because it sounds like you bought the ring as a sort of replacement for the engagement that hasn't happened yet. You don't buy jewellery just for the sake of liking accessories and then say \"I respect his decision and how he feels which is why I bought myself a ring\". To you this is clearly more than a piece of fashion, which is why your boyfriend feels pressured and upset. It's manipulative and petty in a sense  because you're not getting what you want. You're 20 and you've only been dating 2 years, haven't even lived together, chill out and don't pretend to respect your boyfriend's opinion when you clearly don't.", "YTA. You want to be engaged. You got the ring because you have changed your mind and want to be engaged. That's because you're ready and don't need a live-in trial run to make the marriage decision and he's told you he does. You are signaling that you are committed when he is not. You two have conflicting points about where you are in the relationship and you have to decide whether you really are ok with waiting for him to get ready or whether you think he has enough information and is being commitment-phobic. But you are clearly trying to put pressure on him with this move.", "Why do you feel more secure with a ring? Why don\u2019t you feel secure? Why do you want to rush it?\n\nThose are the big questions here. \n\nFrankly wearing a ring on the ring finger in THIS context feels like a dig at your BF. It\u2019s basically retaliation. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou're creating the implication that you are engaged when you're not. He'll inevitably have to answer awkward questions from family and friends when they see that on your ring finger, asking if you're engaged, and having to explain that \"No, we're not engaged, she just likes to wear that ring.\"\n\nYou wearing that ring at this stage is like an unemployed person applying for retail jobs going around wearing a retail name tag to pretend you have a job working in retail.", "> It makes me more secure in my relationship \n\nIt probably hurts your relationship more because you\u2019re dragging your bf to take a half step he\u2019s not ready for. \n\nYTA", "You can argue that it is to feel more secure, but a ring on your finger should not be what holds your relationship together.

You\u2019re 20, slow down. Live a little, stop pressuring your boyfriend. Wearing that ring on your ringer is the problem, not the ring itself.

It also \u201cmakes you feel secure in your relationship\u201d. You\u2019re inciting people to ask whether you are engaged and ask your boyfriend why he hasn\u2019t proposed. YTA, not for buying a ring but for the reasons you did it.", "YTA\nYou committed to not having a commitment, and now want to pretend before the world your fantasy is true. \nYou know all friends and social media will be abuzz asking about the ring on that finger..hoping to convince/shame your bf into proposing.", "YTA.

Sorry.", "YTA, it is ridiculous excuse to buy your own ring to feel secure about your relationship. \n\nTBH I don\u2019t even think you are ready to commit to marriage. I think you need to work on yourself first to be confident and to be mature before thinking about marriage", "Unless you are wearing it to avoid specific recurring harassment, YTA for basically stating you're engaged without his buy-in. \n\nI had a friend who did that too, and all it did was allow her to ignore the years and years her partner put off proposing (they're getting divorced now).", "It\u2019s not about the ring, it\u2019s about what you are trying to do with the ring. You are putting him in such position, that he either has to propose, or keep receiving questions on why he hasn\u2019t proposed yet. \nYou can wear what you want, but the reason behind wearing that ring is nefarious.\nPlus, I don\u2019t get it, how will it make you confident?

It's coming across as the latter, to an outsider. You're both so young.

Nothing wrong with that. But don't use this action to manipulate your partner. That's really immature.", "YTA. This is a flex, pure and simple. Rings are great when they actually symbolize something, but you bought yourself one arguing that it makes you feel more secure in your relationship. This doesn\u2019t even make sense and it sends a message to your bf that you are going to pressure him to meet your timeline that isn\u2019t the timeline you agreed on with him. Furthermore, if you need a piece of paper to validate your relationship, is it really that secure to begin with, ring or no ring?", "I think Yta because you say you respect your boyfriend\u2019s feelings about getting engaged but then you have bought a ring to look like an engagement ring because he hasn\u2019t proposed. So not really respecting his feeling then\u2026 also your arguments about not wanting to get hit on sounds a bit hollow to me. You are putting your boyfriend in a really uncomfortable position with all of this. You may end up driving him away with behaviour like this because it seems like you want to be engaged and you are pressuring him into proposing", "YTA.  GIRL.  What are you DOING?\n\nPSA - You can't force marriage.  Get your education, a career, and be self sufficient.  Be ok with you.", "Why don't you just wear the ring on another finger instead of pretending you're engaged? \n\nYou are creating an awkward situation for him by pressuring him and inviting other people to join in too. You say that you aren't but you totally are and I think you know that, you just don't want to admit it. \n\nWhen you want a baby but he isn't ready yet are you gonna walk around with a fake belly on, letting people ask if you're pregnant and making him explain no you aren't and just standing by while people make him feel bad for not giving you what you want? \n\nGrow up and let him propose in his own time, or keep doing what you're doing and waving those red flags loud and proud. Hopefully he'll get the message and find himself someone that will work with him rather than against him to build the relationship you BOTH want. \n\nOh and YTA.", "YTA: dude told you when he would be comfortable getting engaged. There's a lot of reasons why he would want to wait that long. Especially if you aren't even living together yet. \n\nThe ring isn't just jewelry, it is symbolic. You bought it specifically for that reason, you can't pretend it's just jewelry now after all of that. \n\nThe fact that this guy has a plan for the future that you are directly putting stress on tells me he values this relationship way more than you do. I feel bad for him honestly. \n\nLiving together is a huge step you should be doing before you get engage imo. Everything changes when you become roommates and responsibile for a shared space.\n\nI also think two years is way too soon for engagement, but that's an opinion. When my wife and I got engaged it was 6 years together first, with four of those living together. 6 might be a bit long for most people, but I would suggest at least a few years living together first.", "Feels like an immature power play.

Frankly, I\u2019d be embarrassed to have my girlfriend walking around with a faux engagement ring on.

Also you guys are super young, getting married now is a recipe for a late 20\u2019s early 30\u2019s divorce. Get couples counseling and come to a compromise, maybe he can buy you a promise ring with your birthstone in it or something, so you have something you can wear that\u2019s from him, and is a physical sign of his commitment to you.", "Soft YTA. You made sure your life goal aligned, and when you wanted to change them and he didn't budge, you went around him and got your own ring so you can \"feel engaged\". That's messed up. It's like forcing him to be engaged, while telling him \"no no, it's not like that...\".

Big YTA if you are wearing it and showing it off as if it\u2019s an engagement ring.\n\nAnd engagement is more than a ring. It\u2019s a promise from both people that you want to spend your life together.  When my husband and I were coming up to the end of grad school and needs to make decisions about the future, we had opportunities on opposite ends of the country.  I told him I wasn\u2019t following him if we weren\u2019t engaged at least.  He said he didn\u2019t have money for a ring.  I said I didn\u2019t want a ring, I wanted a date (wedding date).  I wanted a commitment from him that he was serious.\n\nYou are 20 yo.  You are rushing your bf into a promise he\u2019s not ready to give.  To me that would be a huge red flag and you wound be having an ex bf.\n\nIf you want jewelry, then no harm.  If you want the ring you bought to mean something to him, then you both need to get on the same page in your relationship and need help doing so.", "If you don't understand why this is wrong, then you're not mature enough to get married. If HE bought you it, that would be different. I'd recommend he stops dating someone stuck in high school.", "I've had friends feel a bit more safer around men with a fake engagement ring. Some men see it and respectfully back off...but that doesn't sound like your reason for the ring at all.", "YTA.\n\nYou can wear whatever jewelry you want. He gets zero say in that.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wearing a ring on that finger. I wore one before I got engaged because I worked in customer service and got really tired of men hitting on me. The ring changed the kind of attention I got. (Annoying, but easier to spend $20 once than put up with BS.)\n\nBut if you're feeling insecure in your relationship and where it's going and the time it's going to take to get to where you want to go, the ring *is not helping.* It's not you and he working on your issues, it's you masking the issues you have with your relationship. It's you pretending that you are in fact engaged, both to yourself and to everyone around you. You're pretending that promises have been made, when your BF hasn't promised you anything. And you haven't promised him anything either.\n\nAnd if you're wearing a ring that looks like an engagement ring around friends and family, they are going to start asking questions and putting him in a tough spot. It will start to air your dirty laundry for all to see. What do you want from that? To pressure him into moving up his timelines because other people told him to? That's no way to build a successful marriage.\n\n(For reference, I was wearing a silver band with some nice metalwork but no stone.

It\u2019s not about you deceiving your family and friends, it\u2019s that you want the *outward appearance* of being in a committed relationship. Why is that so important to you?

If her reasons by any means are to pressure him - which would be stupid as she risks this to backfire - she would be TA.", "I agree completely but chose to believe her reason of \"I don't like strange guys coming up to me everyday\". If that were a lie, I'd agree about her being TA.", "Because it fucking does put him in an awkward position.", "but why do you need other ppl to know that u guys r talking abt becoming engaged? u sound VERY insecure in this relationship. is there anything he\u2019s done, besides want to wait to propose, to make you think he\u2019s not as invested in this relationship as you? bcs if not, u r putting a LOT of pressure on him to take a HUGE step. that is not going to turn out well for anyone.", "I find it extremely hard to believe a 23 year old boy's family is pushing him to get married.", "Your post literally has \u201cnow we\u2019ve been together for two years I realized I wanted to be engaged sooner\u201d. You\u2019re either lying to yourself or everyone on this whole post. Which is it?\n\nEdit: grammar", "She never touches on that statement when people quote or comment on it.\n\nShe knows she is in the wrong", "OP's edit said:\n\n> I meant it keeps unwanted attention away even though the ring is cheap and I bought it off etsy. I don't like strange guys coming up to me everyday.", "Which would be believable if she didn\u2019t spend an entire paragraph saying how she wants to be engaged sooner and how the ring makes her feel more comfortable in her relationship", "Why? If she plans to turn down anyone that asks, she can... you know... turn them down when they ask. How often are men asking her out?", "How do you know that? I personally never got hit on in public but when I was single and would hang out with my girl friends without their partner they got hit on a lot", "It really is. You get to see everything about a person when you live with them.", "Boy times have changed. When I was 14 my best friends parents would not let her visit me because my mom and future stepfather were not married. But they came over and met them and changed their minds. She was such a wonderful best friend and she was tragically killed from getting into a car with drunk boys. I\u2019m 58 and I still miss her and think of her", "Pretty sure that if I\u2019d lived with my ex husband before we got married, we would NOT have gotten married.  It\u2019s the reason I won\u2019t even CONSIDER marrying someone else unless we\u2019ve lived together for a little while.", "Oh thanks I don\u2019t have that option to quote but I googled it, you just have to add > this symbol to the beginning of your post and it will quote it but the symbol has to be touching the front of the text", "Thanks! I don\u2019t have the option to highlight text but I appreciate the help", "I think that\u2019s the real important difference here. One person wore the ring even before the relationship, so it\u2019s not a new and weird thing. OP\u2019s situation is a direct result of not getting a proposal and implying they\u2019re engaged.", "Exactly! Having a ring to ward off unwanted men is completely valid.\n\nHowever, given the context of everything else OP has said, her purchasing the ring seems to stem more from a desire to hold the social status of being \u201cengaged.\u201d", "Some guys won't take no for an answer but they'll respect a ring on a ring finger. OP said she's tired of guys coming up to her.", "I don\u2019t see why everyone is perceiving what she did as malicious. It\u2019s not that hard to explain that she just likes to wear it, and it seems odd that the boyfriend is insecure about her wearing a ring there.", "Yea I saw that post and I think it\u2019s a bad idea to not live with someone before you get engaged, but who knows if it\u2019s the same person.", "Seriously I bought my single self a rock, I wear it on my right hand usually cause\u2019 it looks like an engagement ring. If you saw the ring and really really liked it, then get it, but this is far less about liking the ring than it is about manipulation. YTA", "2 years without living together is really early imo especially when theyre so young. Whats the rush? Better to take ur time than rush in and get divorced", "He\u2019s only 23, giving an ultimatum to a 23 year old to get married is just stupid. Very few 23 year old\u2019s are ready to get married. Even if he wants to marry her it\u2019s entirely reasonable to not be ready at 23.", "I mean, yeah, I\u2019ve been in a fuckton of situations where dudes trying to flirt with me would only leave me alone when I told them I was in a serious relationship, as has literally every woman I know. Of course it\u2019s not going to stop a man from assaulting someone but that\u2019s also not what I was talking about in the first place, and men can be shitty creeps ignoring a no without immediately committing sexual assault.", "Except that they do. Because she's another man's property, and you don't mess with what another dude owns. He might be bigger & stronger than you. /s  \n\n\n(I absolutely f\\*ckin hate that this is how these guys think, but a fake wedding/engagement band is absolutely a deterrent for at least half the guys in clubs..)", "This is so true. Once I was engaged, I really saw no difference in who was hitting on me and who wasn't. Guys that approached me before and took no for an answer now also took no for an answer but the guys who didn't care about my no before now found it to be more of a challenge to try and get me to cheat on my now husband. Heck guys would even buy me drinks and openly flirt when I was out with my husband. Husband didn't mind much because that just meant more free drinks for both of us.", "She did state it\n\nEdit. realized she stated it in an edit, not the original post", "Yup.  Some men do not care if you have a ring on your finger. Hell, some men might even take it as a challenge.", "She's showing her age by thinking this is a fix to keep from getting hit on.", "I got hit on once while not only wearing my wedding ring, but I my kid in the shopping cart, and was 8 months pregnant with my second. Some dudes just don\u2019t care.", "Right. If he really plans to ask her to marry him in the next few years, a promise ring would be appropriate, but the fact that he has not offered (given the situation with the ring she bought herself) makes it seem like he's not ready yet.", "I fully agree. Especially since her reasons for wearing it change the more people say she's being a jackass.", "Bet ya it's a plain wedding band.", "Nawh she only bought that ring to feel more secure in their relationship. If a ring makes you feel secure you have bigger problems", "Oh come on, we have societal norms, and a ring on the ring finger clearly implies engagement. Op is acting weird and creepy. \n\nOp claims they are okay with waiting until he's ready, but then goes and buys a ring because it makes them feel more secure.", "Yeah, not a promise ring to yourself \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m not OP and you still haven\u2019t explained how you leapt to \u201cgold digger.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to force anyone to do anything \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but even if OP _were_ doing all of that, where do you get \u201cgold digger\u201d?????", "> I meant it keeps unwanted attention\n\nThe edit clarify that she meant she dosn't want any attention outside of it. \n\nI think she feel that anything someone hits on her make uncomfortable (because she have partner), and she wants to avoid it", "A lot? How can you not understand that the problem isn't if she turns them down or not, but the fact a lot of men hit on her what she dosn't want them to? It's annoying", "In some customer service jobs it can happen pretty often if you're even a basic level of attractive. I work overnights at a gas station and have at least one dude a week asking me if I have a boyfriend/can he get my number and I have a ring. I always tell them I'm married. But some dudes get offended and talk shit or tell me shit like \"he doesn't have to know\".", "Yep, and you can work together to set boundaries, change some things, and create harmony. I lived with my now husband for 2 years before we became engaged, and the wedding was 3 years after that. We really weren't in a hurry, because we wanted to make sure what we were doing was right for both of us. Love is work.", "And looking at it the opposite way I have seen so many best friends become roommates and then they hate each other. I\u2019m a property manager so that has happened countless times.", "My wife's mother was so against us moving in together before we were married or even engaged. We had been together for 2 years at that point. She told my wife that we should be married before living together.  I had to tell my wife (then girlfriend) I would never even propose to her, let alone get married, before living with her. \n\nWe lived together for 2 years before I proposed and then another year before we got married.", "Thanks! I don\u2019t have that option either but > worked", "This. If she just happened to be a single woman wearing a ring like that her friends and family would not bat an eyelid. I have friends who do this-  nothing wring with it.   \n\n\nBut if you start wearing a ring that looks like an engagement ring, 2 years into a relationship, you KNOW friends and famiyl will be asking. OP is being passive aggressive to her partner by trying to pressure him via friends and family.  You know she is 2000% doin this because she is desperate to get engaged.   \n\n\nThis is just engagement cosplay, and its embarrassing.", "If that was her real reason for buying the ring, why would all the background about her boyfriend not proposing even though she wants him to be at all relevant?", "She added that as an afterthought after comments started rolling in. She stated her true intentions \u201cto feel secure in her relationship\u201d aka to pretend to be engaged.", "Some guys won\u2019t. A ring imo isn\u2019t gonna do much. I still get creeps coming up to me with my ring on.\n\nKinda a weak excuse imo.", "Because we can read.", "She waited 2 years into their relationship to think it was a good idea, and only after he said he wasn't comfortable moving up their plans did she do it. It at the very least APPEARS malicious.", "Yeah, I mean, I used to wear random rings on that finger all the time (before I got married), but nothing that looked like an engagement ring unless I was trying to send a signal that I was engaged lmao. I\u2019m guessing this ring is a giant CZ solitaire meant to look like an engagement ring \ud83d\ude02\n\nI think OP just wants to get engaged for the diamond", "I'm begging you to consider how different her post would be if the issue was that she bought a ring to deter creeps versus if she bought a ring because her boyfriend doesn't want to get engaged yet. Her actual motivation was glaringly obvious.", "Seems to me like a saving face sort of edit. If her main reason was not wanting to be hit on, she could have told her bf \"Hey I'mma start wearing a cheap ring in public so guys leave me alone.\" Instead she goes on and on about how she wants to be engaged sooner and how the ring makes her feel more *secure in her relationship*, not safe in public, and then comes back later and gives the \"guys will leave me alone\" excuse after she gets flack.", "See that makes sense right? I think everyone could understand that reasoning. Hell it even sounds like something I would do. But her initial statement of \u201csecure in my relationship\u201d has nothing to do with \u201ckeeps unwanted attention away.\u201d I have a really hard time believing that OP actually meant that. It kind of sounds like some backtracking when she realized people weren\u2019t on her side.", "I am not accustomed to total strangers asking me out. I honestly did not realize men approach women to ask them out without at least a little conversation. \"What's your name? You seeing anyone?\"\n\nDo guys really walk up to strangers and ask for a date? And if they do, why would a woman feel bad turning them down for being rude?", "But they ask if you have a boyfriend. That's my point. If they ask, it doesn't matter if you have a ring or not.", "We lived together for 4 years, then were engaged for 2 years, so 6 years in an apartment before marrying/buying a home. Those years together were so important. Living with somebody is the hardest part in any relationship- the day-to-day chores, cooking, paying bills, shopping together, respecting boundaries (the most important thing). \n\nYTA for not respecting his boundaries. This is a red flag for him. He\u2019s asking you to wait and you went ahead and bought an engagement ring anyway. Why? You say it\u2019s to avoid unwanted attention- in my experience, men don\u2019t care if you\u2019re engaged when they hit on you. What about all the unwanted attention of people asking you about your non-existent engagement (although maybe this is the kind of attention you want)?", "Engagement cosplay. Excellent wording. It\u2019s definitely a desperation thing. His timeline was 2023-2024\u2026 we\u2019re a month into 2023 and she immediately starts pressuring him to propose and then buys a ring when he says he isn\u2019t ready!", "She totally said it as an afterthought when I mentioned that use in my comment."]}
