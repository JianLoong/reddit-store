Using a throwaway.\n\nWas married for 8 years. Had 1 stepdaughter and 2 kids from my marriage. Husband has a mid-life crisis, cheated on me, left me for a barely-legal 18 year old. Said our child with autism was \"too much\" for him to handle and he was \"done parenting\". We've been separated for a little over a month now. He has been couch surfing, sleeping at friends places, in his car, and just left our entire lives in shambles. I was a stay-at-home-parent for the duration of our marriage and he left me high and dry.\n\nHe also left his ex-wife, mother of his first child, high and dry too. He was court ordered to pay $400 a month in child support. He has not paid that since we separated in early April. So he's currently two months behind. His ex-wife reached out to me, claims she's \"really struggling\", even though she and her new partner work full-time jobs. She is currently pregnant with her new partner's child and claims she was using my ex's child support to support all of them in some shape or form. Was never any of my business what she spent the CS on. She then asked *me* to provide the previous two months of child support. I laughed and told her no, no way. Absolutely not. I can't do it. I'm surviving off of what the food banks can give me while I wait for my SNAP application to be approved so I can feed my children. I have never been more destitute and feeling like the shit on the bottom of someone's shoe until now.\n\nStepdaughter's mother called me an asshole, and a few other choice names. Said I am partaking in the \"suffering\" of my stepdaughter. I tried explaining to her that *all* of our children are suffering. My stepdaughter and my two biological children. Stepdaughter's mother is now withholding visits, claiming that I \"must have done something wrong\" for my husband to leave me which is really hurtful because it came out of nowhere that he was unhappy with our life. \n\n\nI feel horrible but I have no means or ways to pay my soon-to-be ex-husband's child support. I don't even have the means to support myself or my two children right now until I can take my ex to court and get child support from him as well. No one is winning in this situation and I feel bad but it's not like I saw this coming. Stepdaughter's mother is *still* harassing me today, claiming I \"owe her\" the money and it's \"not her job\" to raise stepdaughter alone. I just feel like we genuinely got fucked over by the same person but at least she has another partner to help her out, I have no one.\n\nAITA for not paying my ex's child support?", "created_utc": 1683757613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13e5e6j/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_soontobe_exhusbands/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
