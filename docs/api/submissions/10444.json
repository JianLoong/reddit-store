My daughter starts work next month so I've asked her to start paying for some of our bills and groceries. When she turned 18 I told her she'll have to start paying for things, so it's not all out of the blue. She, however makes it seem like I'm in the wrong and I want some opinions on this. (English isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes.)\n\nNow that my daughter has turned 18 her dad no longer pays me child support. It still costs me to keep her fed, so I'd like her to at least pay for our groceries and the electricity bill. She's always laying in bed and playing games. She's also not in school right now due to health issues. I've told her she needs to get a job and she can't just lay in bed all day. Because she's at home she has started to make us dinner every day, as well as some other chores, but I still have to pay for everything.\n\nOne thing she brings up is how we have more than enough money to cover our bills. I don't know how, but once when I was checking the bank she must've seen how much money I had saved up. She uses that as an excuse since \"she has to save up to be able to move out\", but I'm saving up for my own house. I don't want to live in an apartment the rest of my life, I want my own house and her costs aren't something I want to spend my own money on. I have to pay for her medications, she has to get biological medication once every 5 weeks that I have to pay for and it's not cheap. The least she can do for me is to pay some of our bills.\n\nShe's been talking with a psychiatrist for a couple months now and recently got admitted to therapy. I think she needs to get off her phone and go outside instead of therapy. Apparently her psychiatrist had told her they don't think her going to work is a good idea right now. I think she's lying to get out of it. It's also not a FULL-TIME JOB she's going to, it's a place she works at for only 5 hours a day to evaluate her ability to work with her chronic illness. It doesn't pay much but it pays enough to cover some bills.\n\nI've been going to lots of clubs and concerts, but I can't bring anyone back home because of my daughter... A couple months ago I was really drunk at the club and proceeded to take a guy home with me. We had a good time, after which he left. The next day my daughter didn't come out of her room at all. I didn't see or hear from her all day. The next night she came over to my room to scream at me crying about how I'm disgusting and threatened to do something to herself. \n\nThis made me really mad. Because of her mental illness I can't live my life how I want. I have to constantly make adjustments to how I want to live so she doesn't end up doing anything. It's pathetic and awful.

Your poor daughter.\n\nStop going to clubs/concerts as much and you'll have more money.\n\nI agree that the average 18 year old should start helping towards bills/rent if they're actually able to but your daughter has a chronic illness and mental health difficulties? And has her psychiatrist saying she shouldn't be working right now. \n\nYour last paragraph is also disgusting for a parent to say about their child. You sound like the child, whining about how you \"can't live your life the way you want, that she OWES you.\"\n\nShe owes you nothing. You are her parent. Your reply about her looking after you when you're older because you are her parent is laughable. Parents are meant to care for their children and that includes mentally. You clearly are not doing that.\n\nAnd the rest of your replies in this post to others are horrible. Of course your daughter isn't going to want to be around you, talk to you, or say she loves you, when you're constantly not believing her about her illnesses even with her doctors siding with her and with your daughter being HOSPITALISED over it. \n\nYou have told her to go move in with her father multiple times because you \"don't want her around all the time.\" You mention there was abuse involved in the divorce - just because you \"got over it\" doesn't mean she has and she doesn't have to. You've pretty much confirmed you mainly want her in the house because she \"cooks delicious food and desserts.\" Surely you want her around because she's your child that you apparently love?\n\nThis poor girl is going to end up hurting herself if things continue like this and you'll only have yourself to blame.", "I\u2019ll go with a soft YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re equating money to balance out your disdain of her living with you. She definitely sounds like she has some issues, but ridiculing her and hounding her for money isn\u2019t a good look as her mother. \n\nI know 18 is legally considered grown in many countries, but she doesn\u2019t sound mature, so as a parent, sometimes you bite the bullet to keep them in the nest a bit longer until they\u2019re able to hold their own in society.\n\nIt will probably be beneficial to sit down and have an honest conversation with her. Try to agree to a small set amount for her to contribute to each month. I would think it\u2019s kinda crappy to charge her for multiple bills right now if you\u2019re not exactly struggling for money. I do believe she should absolutely contribute in some way.

You do not even attempt to understand her struggles. You argue that PROFESSIONAL DOCTORS don\u2019t know what they are talking about.

It is the way you are inherently treating your child. That is the problem. Ignoring all of the professionals about your child's issues. Because you have this weird idea that everybody is lying to you about their physical and mental well-being. That is what makes YOU AN ASSHOLE!\n\nIn all honesty, if you are so paranoid about doctors and mental health professionals lying to you about your child. You genuinely need to go get some professional help for that. I know it feels like it OP, but the world is not against you. Just against how you're treating your child. I'm guessing you've got a lot of trauma that you need to deal with. Because of this, you are harming your own family. \nGo get professional help OP.
