Usually you just regroup and move on to the next fight, but in his case this is his 2nd knock out loss in a row, and the fight before that he was getting beaten so bad that we had to throw in the towel (first time I\u2019d seen it happen in MMA). Even worse, those 3 losses were the only fights he\u2019s had. He\u2019s never won a fight. He hasn\u2019t even come close to winning a fight.

Instead of telling him he's not cut out for it, there's lots of ways you could have been supportive and encouraging.  It's rare that you win your first fights.  It takes time to understand how competitions work and swap from that \"fighting with your mates in a gym\" to \"it's a competition and they don't care if they hurt me\" mindset.  My daughters first few comps were disastrous.  She got absolutely smashed.  But every loss was a learning experience and she came back better than ever.  Now, at 14, she's competing for her state and coaching other kids.  Don't crap on other people's dreams.", "NTA as I have lost a friend who died due to a head injury sustained due to boxing, if he seriously is getting beat up badly at every fight than it\u2019s warranted you have concerns. You could have perhaps came about it better but regardless the place and concern you are coming from are warranted", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not his coach, so he can dismiss your opinion since it's not a professional one. It's probably not a good idea to give opinions like that when you aren't asked because it can hurt. But, no big deal, I'd say. You told him. He gave your opinion no weight. You move on.", "INFO:  How are fighters paired up for these MMA matches?  If it was, say, a chess game, players have ratings so you\u2019d know who is evenly matches.  Golfers have a handicap.  Bowlers have an average score.  How is it in MMA?", "NTA. You're right, some people just aren't cut out for fighting and getting out earlier than later can save them from serious and permanent injuries.\n\nIf you do want to try to help them though, see if they can benefit from full contact sparring, being one level below actual fights, and see if he's just not used to adapting and reacting after being hit/rattled, which is the one major difference between sparring and real fights.", "I really really hate that I\u2019m saying this but I only said it to him because I didn\u2019t even see a glimmer of promise. I was in his corner for his first 2 fights and man it was bad. Idk what kind of martial arts your daughter is doing, so idk how much brain damage she is taking, but I just wanna make sure this guy can put a sentence together in 10-15 years. I might\u2019ve made it sound bad I didn\u2019t just tell him \u201cyou should quit because you suck lol\u201d I tried to be supportive and I even suggested other combat sports where you take less damage. At the end of the day it\u2019s a health thing and I wanna see the guy healthy", "At the level he\u2019s fighting at, people with similar records usually fight each other. So typically someone that\u2019s 0-0 or 0-1 can fight someone that\u2019s 0-0 or 0-1 or even 1-0. There are no set rules around this though. In my friends case I believe the first person he fought was 1-0, then after that he fought someone that was 0-0. The third guy he fought was 0-4, which is why it makes me nervous that he was knocked out by someone that\u2019s 0-4. On paper, none of his matchups were unfair.", "At the level he\u2019s fighting at, people with similar records usually fight each other.

I\u2019ve been kickboxing for almost double the amount of time this dude has been fighting, and he still somehow makes me look stupid sometimes. He\u2019s like a prodigy I swear, but idk what it is he just can\u2019t put it together in a fight.", "Then he might just lack that instinct or ability to function under pressure? Either way, you're right. Trying to continue fighting is only going to do him serious harm. But there's only so much you can do, if he doesn't want to hear it, then that's that."]}
