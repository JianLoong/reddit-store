That's never been me. \n\nWell Em called me Sunday and asked if I could take Timmy to school in the mornings \"for a while\". I said \"what? No I work early in the morning \".  She said \"but didn't you say you could go to second shift if you wanted to?\"  I can. But I don't want to.  \n\nApparently Timmy's dad \"Ryan\" has to work 3rd shift  for a while and Em doesn't want him driving Timmy to school after working because he'll be tired.  Our parents can't because they work.  Ryan used to work second shift and would take him to school then Em would pick him up. Em works 6-2 but has a 30-45 minute commute.  \n\nShe wants me to go to second shift and she'll drop him off by me or I can come by them in the morning, give him breakfast,  get him ready,  and take him to school.  \n\nI asked  for how long. She said she didn't know but Ryan was going to try to move back to 2nd when they have an opening.  So could be a month,  could be a year.

I\u2019m sure he is. He\u2019s too \u2018tired\u2019 to pull his weight with the morning routine, but won\u2019t be too tired to play video games / watch tv, or whatever he needs to decompress. \n\n- is the husband also calling *his* family and asking them to help with the morning school runs? Or are there no sisters / female cousins on his side of the family? Because you know\u2026women are just on this planet to take care of kids.\n\n- really - why is your sister the one making these calls? If her husband isn\u2019t able to do his part, why isn\u2019t he the one making the effort to now get the morning run covered? If she hasn\u2019t already, it might be time for her to learn about unpaid labor in the household. \n\n- your sister and mom have both made it clear that your career / how you pay for your own bills is less important than your ability to be a female convenience machine. Of course you should be thrilled to change your shift! Of course you should be thrilled to take on unpaid childcare at the expense of your own sleep schedule and career! Of course the actual father shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for his own childcare - there\u2019s an unmarried, childfree woman in the family who they assume has unlimited time to be their own third parent. \n\n- all of this is a thankless task being hoisted on you because you\u2019re a woman. I feel fairly confident that they wouldn\u2019t be asking this of you if you were a brother, and not a sister. After all, they won\u2019t even ask the actual father to pull his weight, and no one is putting pressure on OPs father to make the morning run. \n\n- and yeah, families *do* have to make sacrifices for each other, so I guess it\u2019s about time Ryan starts.\n\nYou are so NTA, and not even being close to being stubborn. You don\u2019t owe them an explanation for your time. \n\nRyan and Em aren\u2019t even trying to solve this in house - they\u2019re expecting someone else to make the sacrifices for them.\n\nEdit to add: thanks for awards! \n\nAnd I don\u2019t hate men, LOL. This scenario is frustrating because Em seems to either be infantilizing Ryan (by assuming he\u2019s unable to at least get their son up and ready, and then someone can take him to school), or because Ryan is expecting Em to find childcare on his behalf, and without him so much as making a phone call.

After reading that comment it\u2019s blindingly obvious that you\u2019re a hardcore feminist - or at least someone who thinks women are better than men.\n\nLet\u2019s break down your \u201cargument\u201d real quick, even though it\u2019s completely sexist.\n\nThe husband is too tired: well no. What OP says is that the wife doesn\u2019t want the husband to drop him off becuase she thinks he\u2019ll be too tired - go check it yourself. Not only that but you are assuming he plays video games or watches tv, a fair assumption but still beside the point. It was never said that he does that. \n\nSecond and third points: the husband has actually been taking the child to school every day, so all the sarcastic stuff about \u201cwomen should just take care of the kids\u201d is utter bs. He\u2019s taken the kid to school every day. Again with the female relatives: the wife asked her parents already. Key term being parents. Mum and dad. Also, you again can not assume that the husband hasn\u2019t asked his half of the family. You just don\u2019t know, maybe he did first and they all said no.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s ask why the wife isn\u2019t taking care of the child. Why is (in your eyes) the father supposed to take care of everything? The wife should have equal blame to the husband in this matter.\n\nHoly hell, in this comment you are being so blindingly sexist that it astounds me. \u201cAll this is being hoisted on you becuase you are a woman\u201d. What utter bullshit. OP could be a man and they still probably would have asked. Not everyone in the world thinks that women have to be the primary caregivers: hell, my dad takes care of me more than my mum. All I got from this is that you are a sexist pig, more sexist than anyone I know by far.\n\nThe only thing I agree with you is NTA.", "Thank you.

Why must everyone bend to the will of people that made a decision they think should impact others without their consent, then have the audacity to be angry when other people won\u2019t ruin their lives for their mistake?  Disown sister and mom.", "NTA: You aren't the parent and you were already offering to give up your lunch break for the kid indefinitely. Dad can't drive him (okay I get that) or even watch him for two hours? That isn't your problem.", "I wouldn't even engage them on this topic any longer. OP gave a kind and reasonable compromise. The husband staying up a bit longer before he goes to sleep would be the logical thing to do. \n\nOP's sister is being more considerate of the kid's father than someone she is asking a massive favour of.", "Ooh!

If he's too fatigued to drive, then he's too fatigued to drive, **period**. There is no state of fatigue where it would be fine to drive on your own, presumably endangering yourself as well as everyone else on the road, but unacceptable to additionally endanger a child.", "A few things:\n\n- if your reaction to my comments was to immediately behave in such a rudely reactionary manner, then maybe it\u2019s time to talk with someone. I don\u2019t mean that in a condescending way - telling someone to STFU angrily because you don\u2019t agree with them is aggressive and a much stronger reaction than called for. One might even say that telling a woman to STFU and calling her a sexist pig because you don\u2019t agree with her viewpoint\u2026would, in fact, make you a sexist pig. Oink oink.\n\n- I absolutely do not believe that women are better than men. Both sexes should be treated as equal. I know many amazing men - men who are incredible sons, partners, fathers, friends, etc. \n\n- Em is already doing the after school pickup. Em is now doing the childcare scheduling for the morning shift, and pressuring her sister into changing her work and sleep schedule for the convenience of her husband and herself. This is called carrying the mental load. Men skew towards carrying the mental load in regards to car maintenance care, lawn care, etc - while women skew towards carrying the mental load in regards to housework and childcare. For the record - recently a friend complained about her husband not changing the oil on her car when she wanted him to, and I asked her why she doesn\u2019t learn to change the oil if her husband isn\u2019t available. You see how that works?\n\n- Em called and asked her parents, but in response, who is the one calling and further pressuring OP into changing her work schedule? OP\u2019s mom. The key players in this scheduling scenario are OP (a woman), Em (a woman), and their mother (another woman). OPs mom and dad immediately dismissed the request, but then the mom inserted herself into the scenario. If OPs mom had been trying to push OPs dad or Ryan to cover the morning run, that would be an entirely different scenario, but that however, is not the scenario being presented. \n\n- if Ryan\u2019s family had already been spoken to, then OP would have stated so. Instead we\u2019re being told that Em is working on scheduling - nowhere in there is Ryan\u2019s family being factored in. \n\n- in this scenario, Ryan did the shift before when it was more convenient. The information we\u2019re being given here shows that now that it\u2019s no longer convenient that someone else is supposed to step in, so Ryan and Em don\u2019t have to be inconvenienced. You\u2019ll notice how I held Em accountable throughout, and also held her responsible in this in my original comments and here as well. \n\n- nowhere did I say that the father \u2018has to take care of everything\u2019. However, if the morning run is his responsibility, then yes, I do think he should be the one making calls, or even having to continue doing them. I know plenty of third shift workers - they stay up for hours after their shift ends just like 8 - 5ers do. Part of being a parent is being inconvenienced - like making the morning run, even when you would rather not. I wasn\u2019t aware that a father taking care of the morning routine was \u2018asking him to do everything\u2019. Do you really think that little of men that the morning routine is \u2018everything\u2019? I don\u2019t. \n\n- wishing you well.", "It works so well.
