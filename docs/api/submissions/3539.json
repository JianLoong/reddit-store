I've never been that aunt that \"borrows\" my nephew for the day,  to go do whatever. I mean if he's around I'll talk to him and play with him and I buy him gifts for special occasions.  \nI have friends that'll take their neices/nephews a few times a month and go to movies,  different events,  take them shopping and spoil them. That's never been me. \n\nWell Em called me Sunday and asked if I could take Timmy to school in the mornings \"for a while\". I said \"what? No I work early in the morning \".  She said \"but didn't you say you could go to second shift if you wanted to?\"  I can. But I don't want to.  \n\nApparently Timmy's dad \"Ryan\" has to work 3rd shift  for a while and Em doesn't want him driving Timmy to school after working because he'll be tired.  Our parents can't because they work.  Ryan used to work second shift and would take him to school then Em would pick him up. Em works 6-2 but has a 30-45 minute commute.  \n\nShe wants me to go to second shift and she'll drop him off by me or I can come by them in the morning, give him breakfast,  get him ready,  and take him to school.  \n\nI asked  for how long. She said she didn't know but Ryan was going to try to move back to 2nd when they have an opening.  So could be a month,  could be a year. I'm not going to switch to second and have Ryan go back to second in a month and then I'm stuck on a shift I hate.  I can't just bounce back and forth either.  \n\n\nI get an hour lunch break.

Said that she's not leaving her 7 year old home alone for 2 hours.  \n\nI said \"but Ryan will be there\".  She claims since he might be asleep Timmy would be on his own and she doesn't want that. \n\nI said  \"well, that's all I can offer you. I'm not changing shifts. This is part of why I don't have kids. To avoid shit like this\".  Which he's 7, not 2 but whatever. \n\nEm went running to our mom and my mom says I should be more willing to help my sister, and it'll give me the opportunity to spend time with Timmy.

Also, you truly gave them a great option, idk what the big issue is with him being there with his sleeping Dad?!  I mean...isn't he there with his sleeping parents while they all sleep?  Can't he wake Dad in an emergency? \n\nThey can lay out clothes (some parents have kids sleep in clothes for the next day, to ease the a.m. routhine), lay out breakfast, little Timmy can watch shows or something until you pick him up. Most kids that age would be fine in these conditions,  unless he has other issues, unknown to us.  \n\nSis getting your parents in on it is just so childish...just because others could possibly do something that may make our lives easier, doesn't make it their job to do so. Your Mom should have nipped that in the bud, but it was probably easier to agree.

My family did a similar thing to me when they needed childcare help; I rearranged my schedule to take my nephew, then 2 weeks in they wanted me to rearrange things again because someone else who was helping preferred the day I was covering.

That is not an aunt\u2019s role.", "Worked night shift over 20 years and I never went right to sleep after work.", "I could, but that was more because my body never adjusted to 3rd.
