I've never been that aunt that \"borrows\" my nephew for the day,  to go do whatever. I mean if he's around I'll talk to him and play with him and I buy him gifts for special occasions.  \nI have friends that'll take their neices/nephews a few times a month and go to movies,  different events,  take them shopping and spoil them. That's never been me. \n\nWell Em called me Sunday and asked if I could take Timmy to school in the mornings \"for a while\". I said \"what? No I work early in the morning \".  She said \"but didn't you say you could go to second shift if you wanted to?\"  I can. But I don't want to.  \n\nApparently Timmy's dad \"Ryan\" has to work 3rd shift  for a while and Em doesn't want him driving Timmy to school after working because he'll be tired.  Our parents can't because they work.  Ryan used to work second shift and would take him to school then Em would pick him up. Em works 6-2 but has a 30-45 minute commute.  \n\nShe wants me to go to second shift and she'll drop him off by me or I can come by them in the morning, give him breakfast,  get him ready,  and take him to school.  \n\nI asked  for how long. She said she didn't know but Ryan was going to try to move back to 2nd when they have an opening.  So could be a month,  could be a year. I'm not going to switch to second and have Ryan go back to second in a month and then I'm stuck on a shift I hate.  I can't just bounce back and forth either.  \n\n\nI get an hour lunch break.

She claims since he might be asleep Timmy would be on his own and she doesn't want that. \n\nI said  \"well, that's all I can offer you. I'm not changing shifts. This is part of why I don't have kids. To avoid shit like this\".  Which he's 7, not 2 but whatever. \n\nEm went running to our mom and my mom says I should be more willing to help my sister, and it'll give me the opportunity to spend time with Timmy.

Again, it's his kid.\n\nThis is not a night of babysitting they're asking for and no way should you have to take on so much and sacrifice so much. This is not your kid.", "Lol. Family sacrifices for each other. Just say that right back to your Mom, and remind her to stop being so stubborn. NTA.", "NTA at all. I work third shift (12 hours @ 6p-630a) and my husband has to leave for work as soon as I walk in the door. I speed shower and get my 6 year old up, fed and off to school every single day. Are there days that I wish I could just relax as soon as I get home? Sure. But is it completely doable? Absolutely.\n\nI actually generally find it easier to get her to school, work out, grocery shop etc on the days after I work because I'm already up and moving. It's way harder (IMO) to drag yourself out of bed in the morning than to just stay up awhile.\n\nSister is being completely unreasonable in expecting you to change your whole life around (and get him fed/ready too, wtf?) for the convenience of his father - you know, the actual parent. And he doesn't even have to wake up to pick him up from school. The freaking audacity.. that is an insane ask.  What you offered was MORE than generous. Dad needs to step up to the plate asap and sis needs to leave you alone.", "NTA\u2026 There is before and after school care for exactly this reason\u2026..  nope she can pay for a caregiver or her husband can get up and take him.", "NTA. They are the parents and need to figure out their schedule for their kid. If it was once than that would be different but to expect you to change your whole life to parent their kid while hubby sleeps is a big hell no.", "NTA. You're right, you didn't have kids therefore you can work the schedule that works best for you. You tried to compromise. Your sister first off, became instant AH when she went tattling to mommy to get her way but also needs to learn when asking someone to completely rearrange their schedule as a favor, she's going to have to compromise.", "NTA. It\u2019s not reasonable to ask you to change your shifts.", "NTA, why are you the only one they think should change their schedule? That's just rude", "Don\u2019t help them.\n\nThere will be no end to this", "NTA\n\nSince when has it become the responsibility of the family without children to pick up the slack for the parents.  \n\nI think what you should do, Is tell your sister and parents, that due to circumstances beyond your control, you are not able to help her out any time soon.  So you will have to withdraw your offer of the compromise.  \n\nThen put them on ignore and go about your life.", "NTA\n\nKid is 7 yo. He'll survive for 2 hours even if dad is asleep.\n\nMake sure breakfast is prepped, bags and lunch are packed, teach him how to use the tablet. \ud83d\ude06\n\nKids can learn to entertain themselves.\n\nSounds like she'll need to practice with him and get over her own insecurities.", "Nta.\n\nYou should thank your mom for agreeing to arrange her schedule so generously since family helps out family", "She says she is concerned that her husband will be too tired after his shift. Why would he be more tired after that shift than any other?  Parents get home from work days and pick up their kids without falling asleep at the wheel.  They also give them snacks, get them started on homework, etc.  \n\nDoes her husband have some kind of sleeping sickness or is he unwilling to parent his child?", "Does your sister have anxiety? Because her fear that her husband will be to sleepy to drive or even host parent for an hour or whatever seems ridiculous. \n\nHonestly, I believe this is a \"just lie\" situation. Trek then you asked, boss said no, sorry\n\nNTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Sure seems like Ryan could take Timmy to school. He won\u2019t be tired. It will take him a while to wind down and get to sleep.", "NTA. Funny how your mom is perfectly willing to ream you out for not helping, but her work schedule gets to remain intact.", "NTA. I'm not sure how anyone could not be embarrassed to even ask someone to do this. It is beyond unreasonable. It would be a big ask just to want you to do daily childcare. But she wants you to completely rearrange your day to day life so it can revolve around her wants. And it is wants, not needs. Because *her husband can watch their kid and she just prefers you.*", "NTA", "Not your kid, not your problem. Tell your mom that if she wants to get a different job so she can cater to your sister, that\u2019s her choice, but you have the shift you want and you\u2019re not one of Timmy\u2019s parents so you\u2019re not obligated in any way to change your schedule for him.\n\nHis parents should look into before care or carpooling with a neighbor or check and see if the school had a neighborhood bus.\n\nNTA", "I just don\u2019t see why anyone thinks you should make this your problem.  They are the parents.  This is their problem, and theirs alone.  Asking you to rearrange your work schedule for their convenience?  That\u2019s extra entitled.  No is no, OP.  NTA.  Btw - tattling to Mom?  You should tell her hell no for that alone.", "NTA.\n\nShe asked, you said offered a compromise, she didn\u2019t like it, and you said no. end of conversation. Not your kid not your responsibility!", "NTA. \n\nNot your kid not your responsibility. Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nShe is the parent, this is her problem to solve.  She asked you to adjust and you refused.  You didn't sign up to do free child care and rearrange you life for her child.\n\nShe should look into hiring a teenager for before school care, and find a car pool or service or bus to get him to school.", "NTA I feel like I\u2019m always repeating the same thing on this sub: \u201cdon\u2019t have kids you can\u2019t take care of\u201d. \nEmergencies happen. Sh*t happens. Life happens. But this is a lot to ask of someone. They can ask, but can\u2019t be upset if you say no.", "NTA.  Not your kid, not your problem.  Your sister & mother are incredibly entitled to believe they\u2019re owed ANYTHING from you.", "NTA", "Getting off work at 6, taking your kid to school at 7ish is no different than working 6-2, then picking the kid up at 3ish. NTA, don\u2019t switch your schedule.", "NTA. Not your monkeys, not your circus. Family is family, but you don\u2019t have to change your life to fit in with another family members.

Next time your mom or sister, or anyone else for that says you \u201cshould be more willing to help\u201d tell them they are more than welcome to make changes/accommodations with their work schedule. You offered her what you could/would do, she turned it down, game over.", "Maybe remind your sister you\u2019re a grown ass adult and tattling to mommy is ESPECIALLY not going to make you change your mind.  \n\nStand your ground and continue to tell them no.\n\nNTA.", "So when is your mom going to sacrifice her job so she can take him to school?", "NTA. Does Timmy have a classmate or two whose house(s) he could be dropped off at and with whom he could ride to school? I was a latch key kid with a single mom. I went over to an elderly neighbors house every day after school until my mom got home from work. I was allowed to watch t.v. or work on homework, but not to put our older neighbor to any trouble. I could have easily gone over in the morning for a couple of hours while i waited for a ride to school. I also remember going to a science day camp one summer. My mom dropped me off at a classmate's house every morning. She sent me with breakfast and lunch. I had to wait for my classmate to get up, get ready, have breakfast, and then his mom took us both to camp. I could eat my packed breakfast there with my classmate and my lunch at camp. Surely there are neighbors or classmates who could be asked to help out if OP can't?", "NTA. Not your child, not your problem. Why doesn\u2019t your mom rearrange her work schedule to do it? Hire a babysitter for those hours and to drive him.", "NTA You chose to not have kids to avoid all this. She can find another solution. Most schools offer before and after care. Daycares often offer a bus or van to take kids to school and pick them up also. They do before and after care along with the regular daycare. Both of these offer full days on days school is closed, so it is great to cover during spring or winter break.\n\nI personally would rather help out financially if I was able than babysit.", "OP=NTA\n\nwhat sacrifices is she making for you.", "Do not switch shifts. Do not ask your boss for favors. Your sister doesn't want the dad to drive Timmy because he'll be tired? News flash -- being a parent is tiring. NTA.", "This. NTA. This kid has two parents that can change their shifts, get other jobs, hire a nanny, or whatever. None of this is OP's responsibility.", "She does.  I would tell the sister that, it will go into effect in late May, like the 26th or something, but you can put in for the shift change.  \n\nHow about Timmy start taking the school bus?  My kids all do.  If her husband is home and tired from driving, he can walk to the bus stop instead.\n\nEdit because Timmy, not tummy....", "All of this! \n\nIt's absolutely wild that she would expect you to work 2nd shift, but then be at her home for childcare at 5:30 am. When I worked 2nd I got home at around 11 and rarely went to bed before 1 am.\n\nNot sure why that's acceptable for you, but her boyfriend can't stay awake a couple of hours after work. NTA\n\nEdit to change husband to boyfriend", "There is a vast difference between \"hey can you help me move my couch\" and \"hey can you rearrange your entire life for the forseeable future because I'm too cheap to hire a baby-sitter for 10 hours a week\".", "That assumes the bus is an option.  My district anyone less than a mile from the school isn\u2019t eligible for the bus and 0.9 miles is a pretty long walk for a 7 year old.  Or we transferred from our assigned school because it\u2019s terrible so we aren\u2019t eligible for the bus.", "When I worked 3rd, I never went to bed before 9. Husband is there  he can take care of mornings and then go to bed. Or, strange as it may seem,  they could hire a babysitter.", "Who gets off work and instantly goes to sleep? They come home, eat, do chores, relax, it\u2019s just a different part of the clock than the \u201cnormal\u201d 8-5.", "I work 3rd shift, get off at 6 and usually go to bed like 9ish, BIL could definitely do the drive to school and do the same. My sibling also works 3rd shift and gets off at 7, but they prefer to sleep through the afternoon/evening instead of morning. There\u2019s solutions to this that don\u2019t require you to do anything. BIL can easily handle the morning childcare stuff, sister can handle the afternoon, and BIL can wake up and do the evenings together", "Happy cake day!!", "Exactly. And if your mom keeps bugging you, tell her she can do it.", "There's just no bus for kids who live in town where I live. And a mile long walk is long when it's -40.\n\nThis is why I used to pick up a 5am to 8am baby-sitting shift tbh.", "Same I worked 3rd shift and never went to sleep right away, I always relaxed after work. I mean you do sleep during the day but you can still function after working hours. What 9-5 person finishes work and immediately goes to bed? I vote that dad takes him to school and then goes to bed, like lots of other parents do. In fact a lot of people I worked with chose 3rd shift so they could take their kids to school.", "I hope that at night time, one parent is always awake or else the poor boy will be home alone.", "I don't think it's fair to blame Ryan. OP states Em doesn't want him driving Timmy because he will be tired. Sounds to me like Em has a control problem. I have an Ex SIL that has a kid with her new partner, and she gets angry when he parents his own kid... they are still together, but she thinks she gets to do all the decision-making. It's odd. I'm sure there are others like her.", "OP says it\u2019s a private school - no buses.", "So she can afford private school but can\u2019t afford to  pay someone to pick up her kid?", "Even at 5 a child can usually self-entertain for a few hours as long as an adult is at home and within ear shot", "Well, that sucks for the parents I guess, but they knew that going in. The entitlement of some parents really kill me.", "Didn't you you know? Making a comment guessing why someone might have said X means you agree with everything they said /s", "Or thry can opt to be in the drive back from school half of the group.  I had a car pool group that did before and after.  We each had to drive 2 times a week (5 kids in the group).  It was not hard to get 2 morning or 2 afternoon shifts instead.", "That was my thought as well. Find a college kid who needs some extra spending money and has time before their classes. \n\nThis nonsense is one of the many reasons I don't have kids, so why would I want to deal with it for someone else? \n\nOP is NTA but her sister is.", "Agree.", "That IS serious intervention though."]}
