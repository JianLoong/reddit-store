Pure engineers only become involved once they're looking at manufacturing process.\n\nThose quantum computers that are in the news? Those are all being developed by physicists. Engineers may be involved in build, but it's those liberal arts majors driving the bus.\n\nWhere do all of those textbook illustrations and training videos come from that those engineers and doctors use to learn their trade? Oh yeah, also liberal arts people that studied art and graphic design. Where did those doctors and engineers learn how to write so they could share knowledge within their field?
