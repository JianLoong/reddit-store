Even at the height of my cognitive difficulties, I could write a lengthy research paper relatively easily (and was getting straight A's at a couple of the top universities in Canada) in any number of topics . . . but trying to write creatively was unbelievably difficult.\n\nPeople have this strange idea that creative fields are \"easy\" when all they are is DIFFERENT.
