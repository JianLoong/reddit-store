Anger is an emotion and it\u2019s okay to feel that way and 2. They are leaving you behind and giving excuses for it. They didn\u2019t even think about how your friends may be spending time with their families at that same moment.\nAlso have they clearly given you money/ allowance specifically to eat out with friends, separately from any money used to buy yourself things??\nThose are things they clearly need to do before not taking you with them", "NTA.

Like if you declined going to a family outing because you said you were too old for that (or something similar), than this is just a \u201ccareful what you wish for\u201d moment. If there\u2019s no reason for them doing this other than what we were presented in the post, then they frankly value you less than your sibling and they\u2019re playing favorites.\n\nI\u2019m curious if you\u2019re brother is your mom and stepdad\u2019s bio child but if you\u2019re only your mothers child\u2026 if that\u2019s the case, it would explain this\u2026 not excuse it, but at least explain why grown adults are acting so poorly. *** I just read far enough in the comments to realize this is the case. So basically, your stepdad loves his kid more than you and your mom loves your stepdad more than she cares for you. They are isolating you because you are a product of a past relationship and not their relationship. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through that.", "Some parents shouldn't have children at all. \nYour parents are idiots if they don't want to spend time with you.", "NTA\n\nYour whole situation really sucks.  Your mother is TA for allowing your stepdad to live his fantasy life where only his biological son exists.\n\nYour dad sucks too.  Ideally I'd say go and live with him but that's a bit hard seeing as he doesn't appear to have permanent accommodation - I hope that's because he's a fly in/fly out worker but I suspect not.\n\nDo you have another family member you could move in with?  Grandma?  Aunt or uncle?\n\nIf not, get a job and save up as much as you can.  I'm not sure your family would care if you didn't tell them and they just assumed you were hanging out with friends.  Then you bide your time till you finish school and just leave.  Whether that be for a proper full time job.. or for college.  I wouldn't be telling them what's happening.. I'd just go.", "NTA\n\nTry staying away at dinnertime, go out instead...\n\nWhen they object, just remind your mom that she herself told you that you should hang out with friends for meals instead of with family...  and that youre just respecting their wishes....", "Nta I'm almost 18 and I go to events w my parents but my classmates say they'd never do that ????

Is there any normal morning routine that had suddenly been altered?", "NTA \nThis is a very odd response from the parents. Especially since I\u2019m sure they KNOW that your friends won\u2019t just be immediately over to have breakfast with you, and they should have asked. Shitty thing of them to do, they knew they left you to have breakfast alone.\n\nI cannot imagine being a parent and forcing my kid not to spend time with me. I feel like there\u2019s some other reason, not necessarily your fault, maybe like they want to cut costs or something which if that\u2019s true then they\u2019re even bigger AHs", "NTA\n\nI still ask my all my kids if they want to go out with us or not, and my oldest is almost 20. Obviously, he has the right to say no, but he's still given the choice.  I couldn't imagine excluding any of my kids from anything while they still lived in my house and think what your parents did was just rude. Obviously you're old enough to decide you would rather hang out with your friends or at home instead of your family when they go out (and my kids often do!) but that should still be your choice and family should never just exclude you like that.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Do you think having a heart to heart with your mom would help? Maybe if she understood how left out you feel, she'd think differently about inviting you to go with them.", "NTA.

Talk to your friends, and maybe come up with a plan that when they go out, you invite them round - cook for all of them, and have a big meal together.  When your family gets back from wherever they have been they won't be able to say anything because you will be doing exactly what your mum suggested.  Then if they have a problem with your friends being round whenever they exclude you, it will open up the conversation so that you can explain how you feel about it.", "There isn\u2019t much in the fridge", "Yes, he\u2019s my half brother and he is my step dad\u2019s biological son.", "At least you have the option to go with them", "They very rarely give me money.

Later, when you've nailed down a good education and acquired work skills and have suitable employment, you may even want to overindulge in going out for meals, for awhile.\n\nHome made foods can be more nutritious and better support growth and wellness than a lot of restaurant fare.

If you learn how to clean up really well after a meal you'll have plenty of people wanting you to be around for their dinners.\n\nHow was it that your mother, stepfather, and brother were already out and you didn't even know they'd left?

OP woke up and the rest of the family had already left to get breakfast. They didn't wake OP up, that's why OP didn't know they had left. It's not rocket science.\n\nWhy should OP be grateful for sometimes being allowed to game if the issue is clearly that their mom plays happy family with stepdad and the younger kid, purposely excluding OP from it?\n\nOP is NTA.", "Some people that age aren't allowed to game and others can't, so the fact that it's not forbidden or impossible is one for which to be grateful.\n\nThe mother didn't force the OP to sleep in. The mother is not obligated to serve as OP's alarm clock. The OP is old enough to be able to prepare food."]}
