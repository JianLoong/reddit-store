Pass a bag...

She needs a high strung dog with separation anxiety.", "Common or not, that's a big flaw in any adult imho.", "Agreed I could go knit something because I have like 5 balls of yarn.... But I don't know what.... So I sit bored in limbo going.... What to knit.... Should a buy more yarn.... No buy only knit.... I just finished two of the sweetest baby sweaters and matching hats for my coworkers twins... So I'm that between projects bored.... Oh also making a vintage stuffed elephant sewing pattern for a friend with a different friend... So that's a bored until our next sewing day. So I sit like.... What to do.... What can I do.... Bored scrolling pattern ideas.... Oh I could finish sewing a summer dress with pockets.... No I took that black off the machine and put grey on..... So avoid that. Not ADHD just lots of projects on the go... But that's that project for that think so \"not that one\".", "Indeed.  They're always the worst people to socialise with."]}
