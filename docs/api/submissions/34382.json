You DON'T buy your wife flowers and candy to makeup for your stupidity. That being said unless you always bail on her plans you should be able to pass on a party you don't want to go to.", "YTA for the title. That really isn't the issue here. Also, how did you think she wasn't going to figure it out? Sound immature honestly.", "YTA. Flowers are a gift, not an apology. She doesn\u2019t want a gift right now. She wants to be able to trust you, and that\u2019s not something you can just go to the store and buy.\n\nIt requires actual effort, time, and consistency to restore trust. She may have trouble being close to you for awhile, and the best thing you can do is accept that, don\u2019t push her, and just keep being honest with her until she starts believing in you again.\n\nNo shortcuts, sorry. And no apologies that aren\u2019t good enough to stand on their own without the added gifts. That\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to tell you.", "Yta. From ur post I bet the friend isn't the attention seeking one.", "YTA\n\nNot for buying flowers, but because you WERE using it to get in her good graces again. You broke her trust, that takes actual work to fix not gestures grand or small\n\nAnd also you could have been honest with her about not going. Maybe you\u2019re freshly married enough that she feels like you need to be together for these events but that\u2019s a discussion you have as adults.", "YTA \n\nBy your own admission, this was a large party with many guests. It would have been the easiest thing to spend minimal time with the one person you dislike. Instead you lied in your wife's face. You just told her you'd rather spend NYE alone than compromise and spend time with her. \n\nAlso, sorry, your behaviour makes me doubt just how awful she truly is.\n\nEdited to add - your wife is understandably upset with you and you are acting as if with the roses, your owed automatic forgiveness. That's not how life works. If you keep pushing, she'll just get more annoyed and resentful of your behaviour.", "YTA because you lied. The whole flowers because I'm sorry thing is also such a shitty clich\u00e9. \n\nThe number of times I have been asked by a florist what I did wrong when buying flowers for my partner is fucking irritating.", "NTA for the flowers, but YTA for lying.

Next time, try to capture the humanity of your characters rather than just your contrived notions of the plot.", "YTA for lying.

Gifts are typically helpful, but they don't just magically make things better...keep showing love, and no more lying", "yta. you should have at least gone for a little bit even if you don\u2019t like the friend. go be there with your wife and go home when you were ready to leave", "Yta for  lying", "ESH You suck for lying and your wife sucks for trying to force you to spend time with a person she KNOWS you dont like. If she had been respectful of your feelings in the first place, none of this would have happened.

I bet she has \"hurt feelings\" for weeks and weeks and weeks, oh the betrayal. What a pill. Anyways, no more flowers. Her fake little pity party stops now. She didnt need you there. She didnt need your support to go party with her friends. Its all bullshit. She's getting off on making you feel bad. Tell her not to force you to keep plans you never made in the first place. That way you wont be forced to lie to get out of them.", "YTA, you don't understand relationships.  Your wife asks you to unstop her mom's toilet, you can say no.  You can keep repeating no.

But trying to force you to go to a party with people you don't like on NYE.", "YTA, unrelated to you but my boyfriend has lied to me ONCE, about something academic related, he revealed it to me and I thought I was fine but it broke down my trust as someone whose been lied to so many times in the past, it took a while for me to regain my trust, it took reassurance and communication.\nAnd that was just for something INSIGNIFICANT, we BOTH CRIED over it. I can't imagine how it felt being lied to about your partners HEALTH, she came back worried about you, but you lied. You don't go to the party for your wifes friend obviously. You go for your wife and the food, instead you lied and destroyed her trust in you when she wants and needs you around", "NTA. But your wife is, for forcing you to spend NYE with people you don't jive with. You could have spent it separately, you at home, she at a party that she wants to attend.

You have some responsibility in the fact that she\u2019s mad because you lied but let\u2019s take it a step further you go, have a shitty new years night probably still get into an argument now her new years is ruined too and you are still the jerk lose lose situation. \n All you did was choose the lesser battle, all she see is her feelings got hurt. Men and women argue from different perspectives you\u2019re coming from the point of view of logic and reason she\u2019s coming with her feelings and emotions. Just some advice for the married life get ready to pick the battles and accept that even when you know you\u2019re right and you\u2019re only trying to prove that she\u2019s still going to have to win before the argument is over that\u2019s all they ever care about is thinking that they are the one who are right. \n\nGood luck bro invest in a bulletproof vest and a helmet your going to need it", "NTA Your wives a full grown married woman who makes her own decisions over the head of you, her husband! On such an important night as NYE! \u200b\u200bAnd she was old enough to go to her friend's party by herself.....She needs to stop be little girl mad!.....and she needs to stop making deals involving you, she needs to use her voice and ask you first instead of treating you like you are part of her accessory.

You should've stood up to your wife when she demanded you go though instead of agreeing and then lying your way out of it. This isn't a particularly big lie and unless you lie frequently, this probably didn't make her lose trust in you for anything important. However, lying to her instead of just telling her no definitely made her lose respect for you, and that leads to a lot of problems in a relationship. I don't care if she would've made a scene unless you agreed. You have to be willing to rock the boat sometimes. Frankly, the fact that your wife told you to suck it up instead of trying to persuade you to come tells me that she doesn't respect you very much to begin with. I don't know you, but you might need to get a backbone to begin with. She might also be an excessively disagreeable person who you should not have married.", "you\u2019re an adult, she shouldn\u2019t be forcing you to go to parties, and you should just put your foot down instead of lying. ESH, i think you both just need to grow up", "Try to make up the night to her. Take her to her favorite restaurant, treat her like a princess, and prove that she\u2019s worth doing hard things for. She probably feels like she\u2019s not a priority right now. Your partner was probably really looking forward to NYE (especially with you) and feels like what she wanted didn\u2019t matter more than pizza and wings. She\u2019s upset because she doesn\u2019t feel seen or important. Flowers and chocolate are default \u201cI f*cked up\u201d gifts and don\u2019t necessarily reflect that you actually see her and why she\u2019s upset. Show her that she\u2019s a priority and be patient. I think very soft YTA.
