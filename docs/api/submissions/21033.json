They have 3 grandkids so if they want to give to their grandkid they should also give it to the other 2 .  Fair is fair. Do they even know or address the fact that they caused you being in therapy because of them ?

However, this is entirely cancelled out by them asking for your opinion. If they asked, or told you their plans ahead of time, they don't get to complain if you had an opinion and it wasn't what they wanted to hear.\n\n2- What's fair?\nThe estate either being split between you and your brother only (2 ways) because you are their kids and you can then distribute the assets to your families if you see fit, or after you die.\n\nOR the estate being split between the 2 children AND the 3 grandchildren (5 ways) equally. Because nephew is not their child, no matter how you look at it, so should not be counted as one legally.\n\nOR them shutting their mouths, going to a lawyer and doing whatever they want to, and you all dealing with it once they pass. But they didn't do that. Not at all.\n\nYour nephew, your brother and your parents are TA for involving themselves in a conversation with you about something they should have stayed quiet about, then trying to silence you when you demanded their arrangement be fair.\nLiterally the way they wanted to deal with it was robbing you and your children, while raising up the nephew above your own children's level of importance in their lives.\nThat would also make them TA.", "You didn't made them do anything, you said your opinion and they decided what to do.

Why was it so important for you that the nephew is not included in the will? It's your parent's money, not yours, to share after all. \n\nSorry that you were the invisible child, but this was an AH move.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry, but you are absolutely TA in this scenario. \n\nYour nephew says it's none of his business, well, it's none of your business either. What your parents do with their will is literally their decision and their decision alone.\n\nYour parents are right to say that it's like they had three children since they raised your nephew from newborn to now. \n\nI hope they rethink and change it back. I'm sure your children will inherit something.\n\nEdit : changed to nephew said it was none of his business", "Soft ESH as its their money that can do what they want and leave it to who ever, but they did ask her opinion so she gave it her kids should be included too if brothers kid is", "Yta- it's their money and you should not care what they do with it. Whether they spend it all on come and where's, give it all to a homeless guy or whatever.", "100% YTA. Your nephew has a disabled father and a dead mother, and you\u2019re crying about some money not being fair to you? That is just horrible. You\u2019re 47. It\u2019s way past time to grow up.", "YTA. It's hard to be the forgotten child and I really feel for you I do. However, your nephew has spend the majority of his life with your parents, they are his pseudo parents with a mother that he's never known and a father unable to take care of him\n\nHe seems pretty chilled out with that fact as you said he said it's none of his business and stays out of it.\n\nBut you manipulated your parents into your point of view. Unless your kids have been raised by your parents as well, it's not the same thing", "YTA. It\u2019s their money to decide. Sounds pushy and greedy", "YTA your kids and your nephew are two totally different situations. Did your parents raise your kids since birth? Doesn\u2019t say they did. But it does say they raised your nephew. Stayed with them even after your brother moved. Just because he\u2019s also a grandchild doesn\u2019t mean he should be treated like them. But also also I don\u2019t understand loving people who forgot about you to death but resenting the brother thing.

You manipulated your old parents out of moneygreed and negative feelings towards your brother. Let them decide, in my opinion not just an asshole move, also pretty disgusting.\n\nInheritance is a very sensitive topic, and the number 1 rule is to just accept whatever the person making their will decides. Its their decision. Many families completely broke apart because fights about inheritance, a very sickening trait, like fighting for the remains of a corpse.", "ESH (except for your parents and nephew)\n\nIt's your parents' will not yours or your brother's.

All the grandkids are in the will or none of them. That\u2019s fair.", "Unpopular opinion here, but YTA. My family has exactly this situation. My grandparents brought up my cousin from birth, and when they died, their will was primarily split 3 ways between my parent, their sibling, and my cousin. The remaining cousins all got something, but nothing substantial, and we never expected it to be any other way.\n\nTo all intents and purposes, my cousin was their 3rd child. He was there permanently, he ran errands and did chores for them in his childhood and then looked after them in their old age way more than the rest of us. He deserved an equal share.", "If the grandparents wanted to be even handed equal distribution between the 3 grandchildren would have been appropriated and avoided the arguments/resentment between their children. \n\nMy childless aunt chose full liquidation of her assets and equal distribution between her 2 brothers and a cousin that was like her sister.

Our Aunt had been more than fair.", "That kind of law is not as beneficial as people may think.

They can leave it to whoever they like.", "I don't think OP hates the nephew. He saw how his parents treated the nephew when he was growing up and realized that his parents never treated him the same way. If anything he should be mad at his parents.
