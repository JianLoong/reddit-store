He's had a very bad accident when he was 17 and spend 3 months in a coma. Ever since he's been the child my parents swooned over and they make excuses for everything he does; I've been to therapy because of this for over a decade as I resented him for my parents forgetting about me when I was younger, even though I love my parents to death.\n\nMy nephew (31M) has basically been raised by my parents as well. His mom passed away during childbirth and my brother lived with our parents till about 4 years ago when he moved in with his girlfriend.   \nBecause my brother is handicapped and doesn't have big motorskills, a lot of the childcare was taken care of by my parents over the years. Till my nephew moved out of state 5 years ago for his job.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, my parents were meeting with their lawyer to set up their will, as they're both no longer in the best of health and wanna make sure we're taken care of.  \nThe only big thing they have is their house and car. They were talking about that they wanna split the in heritance 3 ways, and I got confused and asked them why 3 ways considering it's only me and my brother.\n\nThey said they wanted my nephew in there as well, as they basically raised him since birth and consider him largely as their child too.\n\nI told them that's not fair as I have two kids as well and if my nephew is in the will, they should as well.\n\nMy brother said that what they're doing with their money is their business and I should stay out of it, but I disagreed. Eventually my parents agreed and didn't give my nephew \"his share\". My brother called it a a giant dick move and called me petty to punish my nephew for the resentment I have towards him. We broke out into a fight that my parents had to unfortunately break up.\n\nMy nephew called me a couple of days ago to check in on my youngest as he's her Godfather. He had already heard what happend and just said that it was a bit of Karen move to do, but he's unbothered by it as it's none of his business, but my brother is still very upset with me and my parents are rather cold to me as well, AITA here? \n\nEDIT: I did not expect this to blow up as it did, thank you everyone for the sometimes harsh but honest comments, with this is just want to clarify some things.\n\n- My nephew is godfather of my youngest, she is 7, my eldest is 10. He is also the only one in the family around his age. All my cousins are around my age and then there are the small kids.\n\n- He and I have a good relationship. He's always been a very hard worker and studied hard to be where he is now and I can't be more proud of him what he's been able to accomplish with the limited resources he has.\n\n- My parents absolutely adore my kids as well, and babysit ofter when me and my husband need help or are busy with work.\n\n- My parents are in a care home and want none of us to take care of them. They made sure that no one had to. And even when my nephew was living with them, he did errands for them like running to shops, groceries, making appointments for them when need be. Just because he moved out of state he cannot do that anymore. We also did it together as many mentioned that my brother wasn't able to do this.\n\n- It is true that they see my nephew more as a son then a grandson\n\nEDIT 2: To answer a bit more questions I've received.\n\n- Me and my husband have been together for near 20 years. He has his own construction business and I am a head teacher. \n\n- I also think the reason why my parents want to take him in the will, is because of all the medical expenses my brother had with the accident and the continues after care, he's have virtually nothing left of his share of the inheritance. I think that's what my parents try to avoid by putting my nephew in the will, though I am not fully sure\n\nEDIT 3: \n\n- People asked me about my nephew's mother side of the family, but she came out of fostercare. My parents looked into getting into contact with anyone but it appeared she was on her own too before meeting my brother. So there is nothing there either.\n\n- My nephew has worked every weekend and holiday ever since he was 14 to pay for his tuition and largely his expenses like clothes and the like, my parents did not support him financially as much as they would have liked.\n\n- My nephew and his soon to be husband have good paying jobs like me and my husband too, so it's not like he needs the assets either.\n\n- I talked to him about this after this post blew up the way it did and he said that if it bothers me this much he'd rather have his share put in a college fund for my daughter (his god child). I told him that this is not what this is about and he just said he can't win on this and won't discuss this any further and just not inform him of anything anymore and he's going for the come what may mindset. He also said the same thing to my parents.", "created_utc": 1688207294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nrpvu/aita_for_making_my_parents_kick_my_nephew_out_of/", "score": 6197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, again, that\u2019s your parents fuck up to make. As far as you saying something, I think maybe from their perspective, it did make sense, but you made them realize where it wasn\u2019t fair. From your recounting of the events, it doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like you pressured them, rather showed them how it wasn\u2019t fair, and they immediately changed their minds.

Arguing to include your children is reasonable on the surface, even stipulating they get a smaller share- but\n\nAnd here's a huge butt that makes you the asshole: it's their will and their choice to divide it to whom and in whatever percentages they choose.  They're not required to leave it to family, they can give it charity or friends and that's their right.  They see that nephew as another child they raised, and you agree they did more parenting than your brother. \n\nIt's understandable, maybe even fair, but it's not your right, it's their's.

A will depends largely on the people who are writhing it they could write a will to a caregiver who\u2019s not even in the family.

They have a grandparent relationship. Your nephew has a parental relationship with your parents. They look at/see nephew as a son. Your parents get to decide who they leave their money too. They don't have to give your or your brother anything. They can leave it to all the grandkids. They can give it to charity. They can give it to a tree (said this in another comment). \n\nYour parents feel an obligation to the nephew the same as to you and your brother. They want to provide for all their children the same.

Your nephew was essentially raised by your parents and they view him more as a son than a grandson.  Your children and your nephew did not share the same kind of relationship with your parents.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry your childhood circumstances made things difficult for you.  It\u2019s not fair, certainly, and those feelings are completely valid.  \n\nAlthough your parents kind of suck for not being there for you as a child.  It\u2019s not very clear how your brother has behaved as a result.  It is hard to tell if he was spoiled and entitled or if you are just resenting him for being in a situation that he couldn\u2019t control.  Your resentment would be misplaced and should be with your parents.  \n\nYour nephew did not have a choice in all of this and again, his relationship is not the same as their other grandchildren.  \n\nHonestly, you sound a little entitled yourself as though you are owed this, and maybe you are because of the way your teenage years went, but that is a conversation for you and your parents to work through separately from the will.  \n\nUltimately, it is their possessions and their choice.  I think it\u2019s really sad that your parents had to break up a fight between the two of you.  It shows how much hatred has built up in your heart.  But it\u2019s a petty move and it sounds like all of you need to either go to therapy together, or sit down and have one hell of a heart to heart.  But I don\u2019t think your nephew should be punished for your resentment.", "YTA...

You\u2019re entitled to your feelings of course and want equal treatment towards your children which is totally fair, but since it\u2019s your parents\u2019 money and we here can\u2019t possibly determine how their relationship with each of their grandchildren is, they have all the right to will it away to whoever they like. \n\nYou may want to consider the fact that the nephew has had a rough childhood with one parent dead as soon as they were born and one disabled after facing such an accident.", "YTA.  It wasn\u2019t your place to tell them what\u2019s fair or not fair.

Given that your parents raised your nephew, it's perfectly logical that they view him more as their child than their grandchild; furthermore, as your brother is disabled and your nephew's mom is dead, this is the only inheritance he's going to receive (compared to your children, who presumably have two able-bodied parents?). And that's entirely aside from the fact that it's your parents' money and none of your business how they distribute it.", "YTA. \n\nThe N T A comments seem to be intentionally obtuse to me. \n\nYour kids are fundamentally not in the same position as your nephew. \n\n1) Your parents raised your nephew, he was effectively their third child. They did not raise your children. This should be treated similarly as if they had adopted a third kid. \n\n2) your children have two able bodied parents to assist them financially. \n\nWhat\u2019s fair is not always what is equal", "YTA, if your nephew is the godfather to one of your children, clearly you recognize that the relationship is not one of typical similar aged cousins.\nYou don't mention how your kids feel about it and I suspect that's because the only person who has a problem with your nephew getting his fair share is you.\nHis mum is dead, his father is disabled and the people who mainly raised him are old. When your kids have 2 able-bodied parents to support them in the future, who does nephew have? If you just wanted your parents to make up for your upbringing, you should have just asked for your brother's share. (an equally ridiculous ask, but at least it's honest in its intention).", "YTA, and it sounds like you're jealous of the fact that your brother needs more attention and aid because he's disabled...  And you took it out on your nephew who was practically raised by your parents, according to you.  You demeaned your parents relationship with your nephew, inserted yourself into decisions that were not yours to make, and caused a huge family issue because your brother is in a wheelchair and you are not.", "YTA\nYour brother has expenses you will never have because he\u2019s disabled.

SIL #3 eschewed uni education, married the wrong guy, divorced, has some health issues, works in a decent-ish but dead-end job and stayed in town to help out with both parents; financially precarious. \n\nWhen FIL made his will and sought hubby's advice (lawyer), he had already decided to cut out SIL #1 and wanted to split the rest of his estate - family home, truck and a bit of cash - evenly. Hubby told him we didn't need any money, but that SIL #3 both needed and deserved the house, which she could never afford on her own, given that she had been looking after him and MIL. SIL #2 should get liquid assets given she was doing ok but not well-off, and if FIL wanted to make a small bequest to grandkid, that was entirely up to him. So that was what FIL did - SIL #2 was a tad resentful as she had hoped for half the house, but ultimately saw the fairness and acquiesced. Hubby got the contents of the workshop, which made him happy, and our kid got a wee bit of cash which we stuck into her college fund.\n\nFairness should always take into account needs and deserts should when it comes to the distribution of assets, but ultimately is up to the person whose assets they are.

Hard part is they have 3 children. 2 that are \u201cneedy\u201d and 1 that is \u201cgreedy\u201d.  The 2 needy ones live with them (as did 3 up until recently. All kids are over 30) and need to be able to stay in that home for as long as possible. They are relatively independent but can\u2019t make major decisions themselves (or do things like nagavaye things like filing an insurance claim. They don\u2019t know how certain things like credit cards or budgeting works. One can\u2019t manage their eating without someone monitoring and regulating them. Ken just learned to drive in their 30s and neither could buy a car without a lot of assistance) but both have steady but menial jobs. The other has a lot of serious mental health issues but is a high functioning and intelligent adult that can take care of themselves. But they are extremely abusive (so much so that kid 1 and 2 needed therapy for years) and manipulative. So my relative is having to come to terms with the fax that they have to ensure their 2 needy kids are provided for. And this means that kid 3 will only receive a nominal inheritance. They are very not ok with this but know it has to be this way because the also know kid 3 will do a lot of damage if they made it so kid 3 was responsible for ensuring their siblings had their needs met. And we (the rest of the family) all know that can\u2019t happen so we have to step up and that will mean we will be dealing with the consequences of this decision. We all understand that fair doesn\u2019t always mean equal and family member is coming to terms with that too, but we also know kid 3 doesn\u2019t understand or care about that.

There is no way the needy kids will survive without their parent leaving almost everything to them and even if kid 3 wasn\u2019t the way they were it would still end up this way to protect the other 2.
