He is also the only one in the family around his age. All my cousins are around my age and then there are the small kids.\n\n- He and I have a good relationship. He's always been a very hard worker and studied hard to be where he is now and I can't be more proud of him what he's been able to accomplish with the limited resources he has.\n\n- My parents absolutely adore my kids as well, and babysit ofter when me and my husband need help or are busy with work.\n\n- My parents are in a care home and want none of us to take care of them. They made sure that no one had to. And even when my nephew was living with them, he did errands for them like running to shops, groceries, making appointments for them when need be. Just because he moved out of state he cannot do that anymore. We also did it together as many mentioned that my brother wasn't able to do this.\n\n- It is true that they see my nephew more as a son then a grandson", "created_utc": 1688207294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nrpvu/aita_for_making_my_parents_kick_my_nephew_out_of/", "score": 3740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, again, that\u2019s your parents fuck up to make. As far as you saying something, I think maybe from their perspective, it did make sense, but you made them realize where it wasn\u2019t fair. From your recounting of the events, it doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like you pressured them, rather showed them how it wasn\u2019t fair, and they immediately changed their minds.

Arguing to include your children is reasonable on the surface, even stipulating they get a smaller share- but\n\nAnd here's a huge butt that makes you the asshole: it's their will and their choice to divide it to whom and in whatever percentages they choose.  They're not required to leave it to family, they can give it charity or friends and that's their right.  They see that nephew as another child they raised, and you agree they did more parenting than your brother. \n\nIt's understandable, maybe even fair, but it's not your right, it's their's.

Grow up.", "YTA\n\nNone if you are owed anything from your parents' estate and they can divide however they wish.", "Yes TA. A will depends largely on the people who are writhing it they could write a will to a caregiver who\u2019s not even in the family. The reason they wrote for the nephew and not your kids is probably because they have a better relationship with the nephew then with your kids.", "YTA, they can do whatever they want with the will. Even though it is unfair, your parents raised your nephew. Unlike the other grandchildren.", "YTA. \n\n>I told them that's not fair as I have two kids as well and if my nephew is in the will, they should as well.\n\nYour parents don't have the same relationship with your children. They have a grandparent relationship. Your nephew has a parental relationship with your parents. They look at/see nephew as a son. Your parents get to decide who they leave their money too. They don't have to give your or your brother anything. They can leave it to all the grandkids. They can give it to charity. They can give it to a tree (said this in another comment). \n\nYour parents feel an obligation to the nephew the same as to you and your brother. They want to provide for all their children the same. You're taking that from them.", "YTA, they can do whatever they want with the will. Even though it is unfair, your parents raised your nephew. Unlike the other grandchildren.", "YTA.  Your nephew was essentially raised by your parents and they view him more as a son than a grandson.  Your children and your nephew did not share the same kind of relationship with your parents.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry your childhood circumstances made things difficult for you.  It\u2019s not fair, certainly, and those feelings are completely valid.  \n\nAlthough your parents kind of suck for not being there for you as a child.  It\u2019s not very clear how your brother has behaved as a result.  It is hard to tell if he was spoiled and entitled or if you are just resenting him for being in a situation that he couldn\u2019t control.  Your resentment would be misplaced and should be with your parents.  \n\nYour nephew did not have a choice in all of this and again, his relationship is not the same as their other grandchildren.  \n\nHonestly, you sound a little entitled yourself as though you are owed this, and maybe you are because of the way your teenage years went, but that is a conversation for you and your parents to work through separately from the will.  \n\nUltimately, it is their possessions and their choice.  I think it\u2019s really sad that your parents had to break up a fight between the two of you.  It shows how much hatred has built up in your heart.  But it\u2019s a petty move and it sounds like all of you need to either go to therapy together, or sit down and have one hell of a heart to heart.  But I don\u2019t think your nephew should be punished for your resentment.", "YTA... OP you sound like you're jealous of your disabled brother, who, by the way, lost the mother of his child, while she was birthing their child. Get help!!", "You seem like the asshole to me OP. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings of course and want equal treatment towards your children which is totally fair, but since it\u2019s your parents\u2019 money and we here can\u2019t possibly determine how their relationship with each of their grandchildren is, they have all the right to will it away to whoever they like. \n\nYou may want to consider the fact that the nephew has had a rough childhood with one parent dead as soon as they were born and one disabled after facing such an accident.", "YTA.  It wasn\u2019t your place to tell them what\u2019s fair or not fair.  They told you what they were planning and your only response should have been to nod and say, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s your money.\u201d", "Absolutely YTA. Given that your parents raised your nephew, it's perfectly logical that they view him more as their child than their grandchild; furthermore, as your brother is disabled and your nephew's mom is dead, this is the only inheritance he's going to receive (compared to your children, who presumably have two able-bodied parents?). And that's entirely aside from the fact that it's your parents' money and none of your business how they distribute it.", "YTA. \n\nThe N T A comments seem to be intentionally obtuse to me. \n\nYour kids are fundamentally not in the same position as your nephew. \n\n1) Your parents raised your nephew, he was effectively their third child. They did not raise your children. This should be treated similarly as if they had adopted a third kid. \n\n2) your children have two able bodied parents to assist them financially. \n\nWhat\u2019s fair is not always what is equal", "YTA, if your nephew is the godfather to one of your children, clearly you recognize that the relationship is not one of typical similar aged cousins.\nYou don't mention how your kids feel about it and I suspect that's because the only person who has a problem with your nephew getting his fair share is you.\nHis mum is dead, his father is disabled and the people who mainly raised him are old. When your kids have 2 able-bodied parents to support them in the future, who does nephew have? If you just wanted your parents to make up for your upbringing, you should have just asked for your brother's share. (an equally ridiculous ask, but at least it's honest in its intention).", "YTA, and it sounds like you're jealous of the fact that your brother needs more attention and aid because he's disabled...  And you took it out on your nephew who was practically raised by your parents, according to you.  You demeaned your parents relationship with your nephew, inserted yourself into decisions that were not yours to make, and caused a huge family issue because your brother is in a wheelchair and you are not.", "YTA\nYour brother has expenses you will never have because he\u2019s disabled. His son will probably be his caretaker as he ages. The money will help them be on par with you.", "YTA. It's your parents will and their money, not yours, and you should respect their wishes. My parents have tried to get mine and my sister's I put on their will and we both simply say it's your money, however you split it is fine.", "YTA.  You have your feelings, but so do your parents.  If they feel and treat the nephew as their own, that just sucks for you.  It may not be fair that you were forgotten and ignored, but your brother was in a coma and is permanently handicapped.  How do you think he feels about life being unfair.  Would you trade places with him? If not, you should STFU and let your parents do as they choose with THEIR money.", "YTA. Sounds like nephew is the equivalent of an adopted child. Complete money grabbing by the OP. Hope they spend their extra loot on therapy.", "Man, I do not get all the N T A\u2019s here. No one, not OP, not her children, not brother, not nephew are entitled to parents\u2019 money. They could leave every cent to brother and that\u2019s totally fine. OP is allowed to be upset but has no grounds to dictate how parents split up their money. It\u2019s their money! OP- YTA", "YTA and the fact that you\u2019re even giving input to your parents on their last will is ridiculous. That could be interpreted as manipulation or elder abuse. Like your parents raised your nephew. That means they in fact are like the parents to your nephew. That is their decision and you need to respect it. It\u2019s not your money or stuff.  It honestly is none of your business what your parents do with their money.  This whole post sickens me that you\u2019ve even justified it to yourself that you\u2019re trying to be in the right here.  I deal with elder abuse all the time and \u201ckids\u201d like you trying to justify some selfish reason to get your hands on more money or more stuff.

SIL #3 eschewed uni education, married the wrong guy, divorced, has some health issues, works in a decent-ish but dead-end job and stayed in town to help out with both parents; financially precarious. \n\nWhen FIL made his will and sought hubby's advice (lawyer), he had already decided to cut out SIL #1 and wanted to split the rest of his estate - family home, truck and a bit of cash - evenly. Hubby told him we didn't need any money, but that SIL #3 both needed and deserved the house, which she could never afford on her own, given that she had been looking after him and MIL. SIL #2 should get liquid assets given she was doing ok but not well-off, and if FIL wanted to make a small bequest to grandkid, that was entirely up to him. So that was what FIL did - SIL #2 was a tad resentful as she had hoped for half the house, but ultimately saw the fairness and acquiesced. Hubby got the contents of the workshop, which made him happy, and our kid got a wee bit of cash which we stuck into her college fund.\n\nFairness should always take into account needs and deserts should when it comes to the distribution of assets, but ultimately is up to the person whose assets they are.

If they can no longer drive, they can hire a ride service ($$$), have a family member/friend drive them, or in my area there is a Medicare covered service but it is extremely unreliable and not good. \n\nLack of transportation effects them getting to doctors appointments, picking up medicine and groceries, getting any errands done or having any social life. Unless they have extra income, they will likely need to rely on someone for help.\n\nThere\u2019s also the chance that they could need round the clock care or at minimum a lot more assistance.
