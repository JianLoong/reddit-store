She's usually a very good sleeper. I heard her but was breastfeeding my son so I couldn't get up, so I woke my husband up and asked him to go see what was going on. He came back a few minutes later with her in his arms and said she had an accident and was complaining her throat hurt. He laid her in bed next to me while he changed his clothes (he got pee on his) and then picked her up and went back to her room, where he stayed with her the rest of the night. At no point did he ask me what to do or tell me what he was going to do. \n\nI got up this morning and went into her room to tell him it was time to get her up for daycare and he said something about how he slept in pee all night. I asked him what he meant and he told me he put her back into her pee-soaked bed because he didn't know what else to do. I told him there was another change of sheets under the wet sheets (I do this specifically so we can rip the top sheet and waterproof mattress cover off on the middle of the night and have a new set of sheets under it ready to go). He told me he forgot. I left it alone because he was already in a bad mood, but later today I told him that he really shouldn't have put her back into a bed soaked in pee. He got upset and told me he didn't know what to do and I didn't give him any direction. I told him I didn't realize he needed direction and that it seemed obvious that you wouldn't do that. It turned into a fight and now we're both upset with one another. \n\nAITA for telling him that he shouldn't have put her back in bed like that?

Until she\u2019s potty trained, that bed\u2019s gonna have a lot of piss in it, and *your daughter will never remember it.* So give each other a break, yeah?\n\nLet me try to explain what\u2019s probably going through his mind, as a guy. He wants to take good care of his little girl. He feels like the worst father in the world whenever he fucks up, *especially* if that\u2019s the message he\u2019s getting from his wife. Because that\u2019s what he thinks every time he hears stuff like \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just pull the sheets?\u201d He knows there\u2019s a process, but it\u2019s 5 in the morning and he\u2019s not thinking straight and he and his daughter are covered in piss and etc etc.\n\nHe fucked up. In hindsight, it\u2019s glaringly obvious he fucked up. He knows what he should\u2019ve done, he fucked up, and he\u2019s angry at himself about it, and now his wife is telling him he fucked up, which he already knows, so now he\u2019s doubly angry at himself about it. He\u2019s failed himself, his daughter, and his wife in one boneheaded move. And the more he believes he\u2019s a fuckup, the less likely he is to do it right next time, and eventually he\u2019s not gonna wanna do it at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a frustrating situation for all of you, but it\u2019s done, and there\u2019s no lasting harm. Staying mad does nothing! So drop it, for both your sakes. In fact, if you make it clear to him that you appreciate his help, I mean really show him his help makes you happy, not angry, I can guarantee he\u2019ll try harder next time. And no \u201cbut next time\u2026\u201d either. Because he knows for next time! He\u2019s been beating himself up for next time all day. If he really loves you, and you show him you love him, this man will bend himself backwards for you.", "Seriously! I just can't fathom this thought process. Makes me think he's a generally gross person with questionable hygiene.", "Yeah or grabbed like a spare blanket from literally anywhere", "Heck, I'd rather sleep on the floor than on pee soaked sheets.", "Right???  Like I remember thinking to put a towel down even when I was the child wetting the bed. A grown man couldn\u2019t figure out that you can cover the wet spot??", "This might be it.  You were busy, so now everyone you love suffers.  That will teach you a lesson.", "The negligence is disturbing. Maybe if OP calls him on it for what it is and how this could get their children taken from them if it continues, he'll straighten up...or just keep at it if he's truly horrible.", "\ud83c\udf1fthis is it \u2026 Evil weaponized incompetence that hurt his kid.", "I am very dumb when sleep deprived.  I could possibly see myself being unable to think of a solution in the dead of night. Like not even consider the possibility that there is a solution. My only thought would be 'well, guess that's just how it is now'\n\n  But I would not be mad at wife.  More like,  \"wow,  I am dumb,  that was dumb, sorry that sleepy me is a dumb fart.   I'm going to shower the kiddo and take them to maccas for brekky while the washing machine runs\"", "I know it\u2019s so gross I would look at him different tbh \ud83d\ude02 watch that will be the daughters first memory or something", "It's neglect", ">He laid her in bed next to me while he changed his clothes (he got pee on his) and then picked her up and went back to her room, where he stayed with her the rest of the night.\n\nIt's right in the post. He slept in the pee-soaked bed with her.", "Ding ding ding.", "i see\u2014that makes sense. thanks for explaining as i wasn\u2019t familiar with that term!", "wow thats horrible. i am nowhere near being a father/husband in my life but i will be cautious to not be that kind of person and to really take on an appropriate amount of the mental load with my partner. thanks for explaining", "Yeah, I do agree that it\u2019s pretty embarrassing for him to not know that and to just give up instead of looking for it. But I was curious what their point was in making the comparison, since it seemed like the situation they were describing wasn\u2019t as bad as OP\u2019s situation.", "wow this is a really interesting and informative comic to read as a man. thanks for sharing.", "this was gonna be my comment. it's entirely possible (and probably quite likely) that he's just an ass, but the part where he /also/ slept in the dirty bed strikes me as bizarre behaviour for someone who's just being abusive and/or weaponising incompetence.\n\nso if it IS a case that there's something behavioural going on, then either he is 1. developmentally disabled, in which case this definitely wouldn't be the only example of this kind of behaviour, and it's possible he really does need help with things others would deem as 'common sense', or 2. this is a new behaviour, which points to something else and more alarming going on that's affecting his cognition.\n\n2 is a pretty fringe case, but i thought i'd mention it just because the behaviour seemed so bizarre.", "I know, right? Genius!", "But blaming your wife for your fuck up isn't acceptable. She had her hands full with breastfeeding their son. She needed him to be her partner and help parent their daughter. \n\nSure we all fuck up, but if we don't take responsibility for our fuck ups then we'll never grow and do better. \n\nIf he is really beating himself over this, the 1st step is an apology for trying to shift the blame onto her.", "Nah, the dude cared enough to change his own clothes because they had pee on them, then made his daughter sleep on pee soaked sheets.  He cared enough to change his own clothes, but not enough to make sure his daughter was clean and happy.", "What a lazy sob!!! Change his own clothes but his kid sleeps in urine?!??", "If that. Maybe she has to pick his out for him in the morning.", "I'm going to punish my wife for herding my nephew infant instead of helping her helpless inf,er... husband!", "My minimally competent ex-husband would not have known where our kids\u2019 clean sheets were, but he would have at LEAST grabbed some random towel or blanket out of the linen closet to throw over it before letting our kid go back to sleep in pee.", "Geez. I guess I didn't read it wrong! Thanks, friend!", "I can be empathetic to sleep-stupidity, it happens. \n\nWhere he gets my contempt is *arguing with his wife* or trying to blame her, instead of just owning it.", "This is the biggest piece of marital advice I can give and it\u2019s nice that you\u2019re willing to hear it. When both spouses work and life is busy and you\u2019re raising kids and maybe family doesn\u2019t live near you to help, it\u2019s just\u2026a lot. You\u2019re a team. You\u2019re both invested in your lives, your happiness, your kids. You should tackle things equally or figure out a divide and conquer system that works for you. But please don\u2019t ever put your partner in the position of being mother to both her kids AND you. It\u2019ll kill your sex life too. Now go out there and be awesome!", "Because the lack of attention and effort in both circumstances shorted the child of what they needed, sleep. One may have been more enjoyable for the child, but none the less still at a detriment. And both left a simple mess and uncomfortable child for the MOM to handle.", "He didn't care enough about himself. He ALSO slept on pee soaked sheets. Which is baffling that he'd come in and change his own clothes because he realized having pee on himself wasn't pleasant and then immediately put himself back on a pee soaked bed.", "Ha ha! But she'd be enabling him of that behavior if she does that. She's got 3 kids instead of 2 kids and a husband.", "The fact that he also slept in piss does not make it more acceptable that he made his 3 year old child sleep in piss.", "I have never seen a more blatant argument against having a child with a man.", "She is not \"lucky\" that he parents his own child. Poorly. That is his child too.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP only asked him to see what was going on, taking the time to get changed into new clothes was meant to guilt trip OP into jumping up and take both children.  \n\nBTW I\u2019m completely with  OP on this one, sorry you\u2019re husband is being a lazy asshole. NTA", "Acceptable, no. Less asshole, yes. Being so befuddled you change your clothes and then lay back down in the piss with your child kind of disrupts the \"he did it on purpose to punish her\" story spinning out here.", "You expect a breastfeeding mother to feel *lucky* that her husband put their daughter to bed in piss. You need to reflect on a lot of things in your life before you start insulting someone else.\n\nMen with this attitude need to pick the fucking bar up off the ground instead of waiting around for a woman to do it. But because you see other men not bothering to be parents, you seem to think that means any sliver of half-assed effort a guy *does* put in should earn them a trophy."]}
