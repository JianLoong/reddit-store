She's usually a very good sleeper. I heard her but was breastfeeding my son so I couldn't get up, so I woke my husband up and asked him to go see what was going on. He came back a few minutes later with her in his arms and said she had an accident and was complaining her throat hurt. He laid her in bed next to me while he changed his clothes (he got pee on his) and then picked her up and went back to her room, where he stayed with her the rest of the night. At no point did he ask me what to do or tell me what he was going to do. \n\nI got up this morning and went into her room to tell him it was time to get her up for daycare and he said something about how he slept in pee all night. I asked him what he meant and he told me he put her back into her pee-soaked bed because he didn't know what else to do. I told him there was another change of sheets under the wet sheets (I do this specifically so we can rip the top sheet and waterproof mattress cover off on the middle of the night and have a new set of sheets under it ready to go). He told me he forgot. I left it alone because he was already in a bad mood, but later today I told him that he really shouldn't have put her back into a bed soaked in pee. He got upset and told me he didn't know what to do and I didn't give him any direction. I told him I didn't realize he needed direction and that it seemed obvious that you wouldn't do that. It turned into a fight and now we're both upset with one another. \n\nAITA for telling him that he shouldn't have put her back in bed like that?

It's been more than a decade since mine were that young, and I can still tell you where theirs were kept.", "LMAO!!!! Right on!!", "The post said something about him complaining that he slept in pee all night too. So I'm confused.", "Seriously! If only I'd known about this when my kids were little!", "Thanks, friend! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f", "Well if you were never a part of it and let your wife handle everything, you don\u2019t forget you just never learned\u2026", "yeah because personally i would say something like he's a room-temp IQ blithering imbecilic asshole who should never have procreated and passed on genetics with such a strong risk of idiocy and potential piss-sleepers.\n\n.... but also i wouldn't actually say that because i am also polite and definitely agree with the previous commenter's wording instead.", "happy cake day", "He could give her a wipe with a washcloth. That's all you need at 3am. Poor little kid.", "You make thing easier and he can\u2019t even use the already planned by you quick fix ! He need directions to not put his kid back to sleep in a bed soaked with pee!! Is he serious! \n\nInstead of apologising for fucking up so badly, he have the audacity to hold you responsible for  trusting him being a responsible decent adult, able to take care of his own child !!?? When you are yourself taking care of an other one while he sleep. \n\nIf he start calling himself a nice guy, it\u2019s time for a talk and for him to get a grip.", "Oh.  Gotcha.  Thanks.", "This is absolutely brilliant, by the way, and I wish my wife and I had thought of it when our kids were younger.", "Ok hope you can work it out", "Whoops missed that. Totally acceptable. But also if it's that early and he was woken up and did all that you can forgive him.\n\nNo one's the asshole.", "Hi OP, I'm really confused, he changed his clothes but then he went and both him and your daughter slept on the pee sheets? In his newly changed clothes?\n\nIf that's how it happened, NTA with a dash of NAH. He either had a major brain fart or is not very bright. I can understand being a sleep deprived idiot and forgetting,  I can understand thinking \"shit I can't deal with this, I am laying down a towel for tonight\" but I can't understand complaining that I wasn't given direction about what to do.", "Agree! Probably doesn't know where anything is kept except for his own clothes!!", "Dude was probably super tired and not thinking straight. I don't doubt her saying he slept in the pee (even after changing into fresh clothes!!). He was tired. Doesn't excuse him for putting his daughter in a pee bed though. Maybe he literally thought he pulled the sheets and didn't realize it until the next morning, that's about all the benefit of the doubt this guy deserves, and if he has a pattern of not being helpful that benefit of the doubt goes away.", "This man knowingly made his child sleep in urine. Literal piss. and there\u2019s no assholes here??????????", "lol you are ridiculous.", "I think he's an idiot rather than an asshole since it sounds like he also slept in the piss? But the complaints slide him into the AH territory, instead of saying something like oh man I was so tired I wasn't thinking, sorry.", "Yall don't have kids and a job. Shit happens she's lucky he got up and did it. Half of women don't even have that luxury. Yall will make a mountain out of a mole hill and die on it.", "Nah, I'm sure you have 0 kids and if you did your baby daddy ain't around because you tortured him. And if you're a male kindly go fuck yaself.", "This was a great \"how to make yourself look like an idiot in 3 comments or less\" tutorial. Thank you for that", "Dude all he did was check in and lie back down in the pee. She's not lucky. We all have moments when we are holding the idiot ball so I am not going to go hard at him for being stupid but we can have higher expectations for dads. I would certainly hope more than half of them could manage to check on their crying child while their wife is breastfeeding the other one and get the situation sorted, or if they fucked up sorting it out at least not whine about it.", "i feel sorry for ur family", "This was a great \"I have not a single funny bone in my body\" tutorial. Try again weakling.", "Bruh you already achieved the goal. A 4th comment was redundant atp. I suppose I do love a teacher that goes above and beyond, though", "Dude you suck", "Dude", "Not as much as your life. Be a better father. Get a better job. It will be okay."]}
