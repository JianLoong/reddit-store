I normally get my hair cut short. Not quite a buzz cut but still pretty short. \n\nAfter I got my haircut Amy asked me if she could get a haircut like mine. She had lovely long hair so I wasn't sure if she was just interested and would regret it after. Both me and the barber repeatedly asked her if she was *absolutely sure* she wanted a short haircut and warned her that her hair might take years to get as long as it used to be, but she insisted she did. \n\nFortunately she liked her new hairstyle, and when she went to school everyone thought it was cool, so everything seemed to be fine. \n\nBut when my ex came to pick her up, she was enraged. She said I had \"no right\" to cut her hair like that, that now she'll think it's \"acceptable to look like a boy\". Worst of all she was angry that \"now she looks even more like you\". \n\nFirstly, she's a total girly girl. She loves pink dresses and tiaras, loves playing around with makeup and painting her nails, and even paints mine when she stays here. I wouldn't have a problem if she was \"trying to look like a boy\", but that's obviously not the case here. She's just a kid interested in trying something new. \n\nSecondly, I asked her repeatedly if she was sure this was what she wants, and warned her of the consequences. She insisted, and actually likes how it turned out. Yes, she's only a child, but she's old enough to make decisions about how she wants to look. \n\nI'm not saying I shouldn't have asked for my ex's permission first, but it's a haircut that she wanted, that she now likes.

Let her have her Dad be her hero because if her mother and others with the same opinions as you are consider greater than equal you are dead wrong", "She\u2019s 6 that\u2019s what 6 year olds do, that\u2019s why if they want something or want to do something they typically wouldn\u2019t want, you let them think about it for a few hours or days first not just go straight to it", "he was lucky her class was fine with it . it doesn't matter how often she was asked imagine if her class made fun of her the next day then her liking it would turn her into crying for weeks or months and mom would have to find stuff to cover it. Yes it is just hair but if he cut of 24cm of her hair it would take 2 years to grow back because hair only grows 1 cm per month it will take at least a year to get it back to her shoulders", "Agreed, but she is 6. And OP is not the primary care giver. As the primary caregiver, the ex should have been the one deciding if the child can get the haircut she wants. \n\nIt's not a question here of \"Should a 6 yo get the haircut they want\", it's an issue of \"Can I, the not-primary caregiver of my child, take decision that will majorly affect the appearance of my child without consulting the primary caregiver\". The answer here is \"clearly not\". Whether the ex say yes or no is another story. She would be an ass to say no, sure. But as the legal guardian of the child, it's her decision to make. \n\nIf they had a proper child custody agreement, and the ex decide to take that in front of a judge, this could be a reason to remove the custody rights he has.", "Indeed. The standards are arbitrary and ridiculous.", "I can't imagine (willingly) doing that to myself as a guy, though I did have to cut it short a couple of years ago thanks to a knot I couldn't get out. Now I just need to wait on it getting back to the correct length.\n\nI wouldn't be too sure on no one being confusing your gender though. Even with a 6 inch beard and my hair pulled into a ponytail instead of hanging loose I've been called a lady before. Admittedly mostly by people being distracted by small children.", "I don't think this is a logical problem that needs to be solved. What information was missing? Wait for what?\n\nIn all likelihood, the kid's schoolmates are gonna tease her. That's a consequence, and an opportunity for learning in and of itself.", "A happy kid that\u2019s going home to a mother that\u2019s shouting at her for looking like a boy and no escape other than school for the next two weeks. See no thought of any consequences", "I\u2019m sorry but he\u2019s not an equal parent if he\u2019s not doing equal work in raising the child, school, doctors, dentists all fall on weekdays which he doesn\u2019t have the child on. He\u2019s a Disney dad at best", "still it'd be too late. she would have wanted to get her hair cut sooner or later though. but it seems she likes it so :)", "Thats what I thought. Girls with short hair got bullied relentlessly when I was a kid, usually because they only had their hair cut short if they had nits. Maybe its different now.", "I hear what you're saying about custody, and the other caregiver dealing with the fallout.\n\nI disagree with your point about \"Should a 6yo get the haircut they want\" not being the question.  If mom's response was that their daughter would look like a boy, then mom wouldn't let the kid get that haircut.  Since this is the only way the kid gets the haircut, that question does factor in.\n\nI do think OP should have waited a day and come back the next though.", "That is ridiculous! It\u2019s a haircut and you don\u2019t know a damn thing about this family! Remove custody because he let her cut her hair?? Yeah maybe he could have contacted his ex but I don\u2019t think she would have agreed with the remarks given clearly intended to offend her ex whilst telling her daughter how awful she looks so yeah she the primary care giver has to deal with what\u2019s happened and not make her daughter feel like she\u2019s done something bad because she hasn\u2019t and neither has her father.", "There are 100 of apps for seeing what a haircut will look like before getting a haircut. The reason there are so many is because people need a visual. A 6 yo cannot reasonably guess what the consequences of getting her hair chopped off will be. \n\nMaybe ... just maybe she was only getting her haircut because Dad did it. She\u2019s 6. Waiting a day or two to make this decision wouldn\u2019t kill anyone. This could\u2019ve been a miserable experience for this little girl. Thankfully it was not. \n\nI find it strange that people believe bodily autonomy is so important but a person who cares about what their hair looks like is making a \u201cbig fuss\u201d. If you want your hair purple & it turns out green then make a big fuss.", "Look that happens even when families are not separated or divorced etc and it\u2019s often up the mother to do the school, dentist and doctor etc but not always. I have been married for over 22 years and I have always been the one who has done those things plus buy the clothes, birthday and Xmas gifts and many other things that doesn\u2019t make my husband less of a parent.", "I don't think they are. Half of my little cousins (just the girls) have short hair and afaik they faced no problems", "Yup this is what all the YTAs miss :(", "Woah, slow down. You are getting angry over nothing. I feel like you are projecting a little here. Take a step back.\n\nTo start, I never said he should get custody removed. My only point was that, when you have a proper custody agreement, the judge usually include clauses about which parent can decide about haircut, or ear piercing, or medical care, etc. Haircuts are usually part of the deal. If you don't respect a custody agreement, you can lose your kid's custody. Shared custody is allowed by a judge only if they have proof that the 2 parents can co-parent. If one of them cannot understand boundaries and respect them, then it's not good parenting and can be harmful to the child.\n\nAnd second... imagine being the first caregiver of a child, taking care of her all week long, and most weekends. And then your ex thinks it's ok for him to do whatever they want with the kid and not give you a head's up. Yeah... no. Co-parenting means you need to take decisions together, not just decide on a whim without including the other co-parent.", "Sounds like you need to read OP's post again.", "My ex has our son for a grand total of 4 hours a week, has nothing to do with education or health not from the lack of me asking, he\u2019s just not bothered and if he made any major decisions about our child without my knowing or consent I would be fuming because I am the primary parent not him", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it happened though and please equate haircuts to piercing\u2019s or medical care because they are not equal at all. Why wouldn\u2019t OP have said it was a condition in the custody agreement and explain that if it was the case? He is also not getting her a tattoo or piercing and didn\u2019t take her for an unnecessary medical procedure so maybe you are the one projecting? I\u2019m a mother and I understand that perhaps when possible consultation is preferred however I don\u2019t believe his ex provides him with the same courtesy and the custody arrangements are not always indictiative of who is the better parent or should have more say. The custody arrangements are fluid enough for him to have his daughter on this occasion for longer but regardless of this it\u2019s not an appropriate response from his ex to make these comments because you can get that any regrets will be planted in her mind with remarks like and her overall opinion of him and his parenting ability.", "I\u2019m other words your projecting because the situation is personal to you?", "See this is your personal situation and projecting that onto OP is unfair as that\u2019s not his situation and he doesn\u2019t ever indicate that it is. I\u2019m sorry that you are not in a happy co parenting relationship and I hope you are genuine with your attempts at trying to engage your ex as I\u2019m sure you are aware that many primary caregivers make access very difficult and although they complain about their dead beat ex they also block any other access opportunities for a whole host of reasons that are not legitimate so it\u2019s not always a cut and dried situation and I\u2019m sure you are aware of parental alienation? This is a very real problem that the anger and resentment towards the ex partner due to a multitude of reasons is used in a extremely damaging way that is at the detriment to everyone involved- yes there are parents who are not involved and don\u2019t want to be involved and there are also many who are desperate to have more time with their children but are continually manipulated by the primary caretaker who has the ability to make access easier or harder depending on their personal feelings towards them and not what their children or ex partner is entitled to", ">please equate haircuts to piercing\u2019s or medical care because they are not equal at all\n\nI didn't equate them. I listed them as \"part of a custody agreement\".\n\n>Why wouldn\u2019t OP have said it was a condition in the custody agreement and explain that if it was the case?\n\nIf both co-parents have a say, then both parent should be able to say something ? Op didn't let his ex have a say here. He just did it without asking. Without a head's up.\n\n>it\u2019s not an appropriate response from his ex to make these comments because you can get that any regrets will be planted in her mind with remarks like and her overall opinion of him and his parenting ability.\n\nYou assume the remarks were done in front of the child. OP didn't say that. OP doesn't mention the kid's reaction to her mom's word either. For all we know, she could have ask to speak to him in private.", "Boom!  Nailed it.", "Not personal no but similar yeah and you can\u2019t say you\u2019re an equal parent and think you have equal say when you don\u2019t do equal work raising the child.\nParents (not just dads) that only see there children on weekends, don\u2019t have half the responsibility that the parents that have them the other days do.\nIf OP wants to have equal say on everything there child does maybe he should step up and take his child to school a few days a week", "I admit I have blocked access to my son one time and that\u2019s because my ex was bringing a new girl out with them every time he had my child and it was confusing the hell out of him. I have multiple times tried to engage my ex in everything from doctor\u2019s appointments to parents evening and nothing has ever come of it and I\u2019m now of the mindset that as long as my child is happy and healthy it\u2019s not my job to make sure he knows everything that is going on with him, it\u2019s on my ex to ask. Sometimes a deadbeat is just a deadbeat and people need to stop making excuses for them. If many single parents regardless of gender can make working and being a parent and running a household work then there\u2019s no excuse for only seeing your child 4 days a month", "The remarks may not have been made in front of the child in the first instance but they will no doubt be very unhappy about it and the child will be acutely aware of this as her mother makes other remarks about her hair in other ways that are just as damaging"]}
