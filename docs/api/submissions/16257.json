Your brother needs to stop obsessing so much about what other people think. Guarantee no one was looking", "NTA that is normal he's ta", "NTA. Your fine. I\u2019m like your brother, he just needs to get used to it. He might have OCD, or something like that.", "NTA. Maybe I am just Canadian, but I would not bat an eyelash if somebody did this. It's just a form of sugar. It completely dissolves into hot liquids. It's like some caf\u00e9s offer agave... same deal. Your brother is weird to get hung up on this. Lots of vegans use maple syrup in just about everything as some sugar is whitened in non-vegan ways.", "NTA!  I literally put maple syrup in my coffee every day. It tastes so much better than sugar.  \n\nLike sugar wouldn\u2019t make the cup sticky!  Or creamer making it milky.  They have dish washers for a reason.", "? It makes it hard to clean? Yeaah, restaurants have big industrial dishwashers, it takes the same amount of effort as any other cup since they all get blasted with scalding water\n\nNTA", "YTA for trying to use your autism as an excuse for your behavior.", "Nta. Does your bro even wash dishes? Syrup should dissolve in hot coffee so it will be easier to clean.", "NTA. I\u2019ve mixed maple syrup in my coffee before. It tastes great and it\u2019s not doing any harm. Nobody forced your brother to try it so he can mind his own business and STFU.", "NTA. I want to try this now.", "I don't think that you're TAH for mixing syrup I to your sugar, but I also don't see why this situation is anywhere near worthy of an AITA post at all. Nobody's called you TAH.", "NTA I use maple syrup at home in my coffee every day. Hot or cold it makes no difference in cleaning and tastes better then regular sugar.", "My bf uses maple syrup in his coffee everyday. \n\nYes we are Canadian and it's the real maple syrup. Not pancake syrup.", "NTA. You can be my friend but your brother can\u2019t be cus he\u2019s boring. ;)", "NTA. Quality maple syrup in coffee is God tier", "um\u2026 is your brother okay? NTA.", "I carry a small flask of maple syrup with me just in case where I'm going doesn't have it. There is nothing wrong with maple syrup.", "Yeah I use honey or if there is none then only brown sugar in my black coffee.", "Subbed in for *creamer*, though?\n\n>In absence of creamer, I decided to use the maple syrup at the table.\n\nCreamer isn't a sweetener, at least primarily.  I do not remotely question using it as a sub for sugar, just *creamer*.", "My BF uses honey in his coffee (and iced tea). Whatever makes you happy. Life is short.", "Coffee shops where I\u2019m from use chocolate, caramel and other syrups regularly in coffee.\n\nMaple should be more widely available in coffee shops imo.\n\nNta, tell your brother to pies off", "Weird take unless I missed OP mentioning their gender?  Looking at their post history I'm guessing male but total guess.", "What behavior, brother is the one still pissing and moaning about this shit a year later.", "So I make maple syrup (not this year, giving our tree a year to recoup after last year's  storms) and I'll use the maple water to make coffee. Freaking delicious. \n\nAlso, I have used the syrup in lieu of a sweetened creamer and it's fantastic.", "You should! It is delicious.\n\nMy favorite is to use it in a super dense cold brew with a bit of whole milk. It's thick and rich, the maple flavor is great, and it dissolves into the cold coffee much better than granulated.", "I buy maple sugar, just to add to my coffee. 10/10 would recommend.", "OP did say harder to clean if cold. \n\nEasy to clean either way though so their brother is wrong", "Mmmmm will try that.", "I don't presume to know what you mean, only what you write.  If you're being facetious perhaps a /s would let us know.  Otherwise we take you at your word.", "Oooo, did you do the maple weekend this year? We got some excellent cardamom infused syrup that is to die for!"]}
