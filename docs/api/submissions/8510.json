Since we were kids, Lucy has been copying me and stealing my dreams and even now that we are adults, she continues to do so.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I was really into computers and video games and wanted to become a software developer. Lucy barely ever touched the computer and was interested in biology and medicine instead. Then she just suddenly decided she will become a software developer out of literally nowhere and went to study computer science.\n\nThen I told her about my dream of moving to the capital city of our county. She told me she doesn't want that for herself, because houses are insanely expensive there, she wants to stay in the countryside forever. Then what did she do? Like half a year later moved to the capital city.\n\nThe most recent thing was me talking about wanting to move to Western Europe (we are in Eastern Europe). She again, told me a bunch of reasons why she would never do that. That was less than a year ago and guess what she just announced? Yes! She and her husband are moving abroad!\n\nAt this point, I know it's not just a coincidence, she is doing it on purpose. I told Lucy that I would appreciate if she stopped stealing away my dreams. It's actually sad that this is how she lives her life, never having an original idea, just coping whatever I told her I want to do.\n\nShe acted all clueless and asked what the hell I'm talking about. I listed her the main things, the job, the capital city and now the moving abroad. She said none of it had anything to do with me and she had long forgotten that I ever planned to be a software developer. She told me in a really condescending way that if you ask college educated under-30s in our country, at least 80% of them will say they are thinking about moving abroad.\n\nShe said we are both unoriginal in the same way, but I'm also delusional and self-centred.\n\nShe angered me so much and her insults and defensiveness only proved that I was right about her. However, she since told our entire family and they all treating me like I'm just jealous little boy. Especially my brother is saying that I should apologise to Lucy before she moves abroad and maybe in a year or so she would be willing to help me move there too. AITA?\n\n---\nEDIT:\n\nI know Lucy is not preventing me from doing these things, that's not what I'm implying. I didn't go to study computer science, because I was told I had to be good at math for that and I wasn't (now I know that was a mistake). I didn't move to the capital city, because I couldn't afford to rent an apartment there. My problem is that it just feels soo malicious of her. \n\nIt's like she is thinking \"Oh, there is this thing you really want to to, but can't? Well, I never wanted to do that, but I actually can, so now I will just to ahead and do it!\"\n\nIf it just happened one or two times, sure.

Because that's how growing up works: as you grow, and go through childhood, adolescence and enter adulthood you consider a wide variety of interests and possibilities for your future, try them on for size, and discard the ones that it turns out you don't want after all, and try new ones.\n\nNo one is required to do the things they thought they wanted to do when they were 10 or 12 or 15 or even 18 because they once thought that's what they would do \"when they grew up\" and said so to you.

Or even the only one amongst people you know? Moving to a major metropolitan hub is . . . really common among young adults looking to start a career. The same with moving overseas while you're young and don't have a lot of responsibilities, to explore career opportunities. I'm honestly flabbergasted that you're trying to gatekeep MOVING COUNTRIES, as if that isn't a thing that MILLIONS of people do every year, just because one of those people is, um, related to you? And didn't get your permission first? \n\nSimilarly, did you think that you were the ONLY person of your generation who was going to go into your career field? Or was it just that your cousin needed to get your permission and let you know 10 years in advance that she wanted to do the same thing? Like . . . exactly what are the rules for being \"allowed\" to study or work in a certain field, per you? \n\nOf course YTA. You're behaving like a preschooler hoarding toys and shouting, \"You can't play with them because they're MY favourite!\" That's not how the world works. Grow up.", "\"Stealing your dreams\" would imply your cousin did them and took action to prevent you from following your dreams.\n\nI didn't see any of that in your post.\n\nAre you upset that she did everything first?\n\nYou're mad because she had the same ideas as you.\n\nYTA", "Esh - if you think she\u2019s copying you, stop telling her anything. Doesn\u2019t that sound logical?", "I'm going to say NTA, HOWEVER, her decisions are not stealing away from you. Her actions are not preventing YOU from continuing on with your dreams. It may be annoying, and I can understand why you feel that way, but her making those decisions isn't stopping you. Just do what you want to do and ignore her.\n\nA good book for you might be Strong Women Lift Each Other Up by Molly Galbraith. It can help reframe your mindset when it comes to accomplishments and other women.", "I\u2019m reminded of a previous AITA post where a roommate? or a friend? was continuously copying the other. No one truly believed that was the case. Until the person being copied posted a photo of herself with a new pixie haircut that was a wig or photoshopped, and the copier shows up a day or two later with the same cut. The copier then became very mad when the girl she was copying showed up with her same long hair, and was berating her for \u201ctricking\u201d the copier into getting a pixie cut. Then people believed she was, indeed, being copied a lot. Single White Female, anyone?\n\nSo. Is she truly copying your life choices? It\u2019s entirely possible. Maybe it\u2019s time to post of photo of you with a pixie cut, or make a large announcement about moving to the States and see what happens from there. \n\nAt this point, ESH. No proof, you do kind of sound self centered, but I think your cousin may indeed be copying you, which makes this ESH.", "NTA however you have years of experience with her actions, if you don\u2019t like her stealing your dreams then don\u2019t tell them to her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe she doesn't admit this herself or to you, but usually when this is seen in siblings and such, it's because the sibling really admires the person and wants to be like them. She could deny all the ideas and dreams at first but then subconsciously it could be at her, driving her to suddenly think she came up with the idea herself.   \n\n\nEven if that's not the case, you also have to consider the fact that you share 12.5% of genetics. Genetics play a huge contributing factor in determining personality, likes/dislikes, and so forth. It could that she refuses the dreams originally but then the more she thinks about it the more she realises maybe that's what she wants to do. Maybe you just have good ideas and because you're similar she eventually thinks they are good ideas too.   \n\n\n**Her:** She should not be playing clueless. Even if she is clueless she should respect that these things make you uncomfortable. Maybe if it was one or two things you could get over it, but if she's copying as much as you say then she should stop and be like \"I'm sorry, I didn't realise, I'll do this instead\" and take a moment to reflect on her own behaviour. Clearly you're not saying this out of nowhere and have evidence backing it up so she should stop and try to figure out why she is doing the same things. Playing dumb makes her look guilty and obviously doesn't portray her in the best light, and she should be able to see how it looks bad for her, even if it isn't intentional.   \n\n\nInstead of freaking out to her, both of you should try and talk about it. Explain to her that it's frustrating because you feel like you can't have your own independent life because she keeps appearing everywhere in it and doing the same things. She also should NOT have told the family. This was a matter between you two and now she has caused unnecessary drama that again, restricts you further from doing what you want without judgement.   \n\n\nExplain to your family as well that you don't feel like you've independence and that seven if your cousin doesn't understand where you're coming from, she should still respect that it upsets you, but instead she chooses to ignore this and that's not fair either.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Excellent reply\ud83d\ude02", "If she uprooted her whole life to move somewhere!", "If they are from the same family, there is a good chance they also raised in similar environments and as a result, have similar aspirations.", "I think he believes they\u2019ve been stolen because she has achieved them and by the sound of it, he has not.

Like nothing is going to come about telling her off", "Lucy is just living her life. It\u2019s not her fault you haven\u2019t achieved your dreams. Your jealousy of her is unhealthy\n\nYTA", "YTA. I am sorry but honey, your dreams aren't original.\nJealousy won't get you anywhere, will just make you paranoid at this point. If you want to go abroad then so do it? Did you really expect that no one else has the dream to go abroad?\nIf being a software engineer and going abroad is your \"dream\", why are you not following it? oh, because Lucy \"stole\" your dreams?", "YTA. YOU decided that you couldn't do computer engineering because \"math is hard\" YOU then didn't earn enough $ to move to capital city. YOU didn't apply to overseas jobs or see how to get visas. See how non of this involves your cousin?", "YTA. Lucy did Lucy and you didn\u2019t do you, and it\u2019s eating you alive. Leave Lucy alone. Focus on yourself.", "Maybe go back and study computer science.  At least take a course. Get your own dreams in track. YTA to you.", "Seriously! Nothing the cousin \u201ccopied\u201d was even relatively unique lol. Everyone wants to travel. The capital city is the biggest and most populated place in most cases. Computer science is a popular field and there\u2019s been a push to get women into stem. YTA op, worry about your own dreams", "This. Sorry, OP, but stop telling her your dreams if you're worried about this. But, also, look deep inside. Could it be possible any of your feelings are coming from jealousy? Most people see others and wonder about the path not traveled, but you can't turn around and start accusing everyone of stealing your dreams.", "I realised my true dream is to become a circus clown and learn to juggle while riding a unicycle."]}
