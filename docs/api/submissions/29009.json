While misplacing anger isn't uncommon with trauma and grief, it's extra shitty that you and the room situation is where it's landed. \n\nI obviously don't know the layout of the house, but it would make sense for the two older girls to share a room, and your aunt and youngest cousin to share a room. They can have separate beds, put up a room divider or something if they need to.\n\nNow onto the autism piece.... Everyone's different of course. But since this is such a massively life altering thing, it might actually HELP Rylie to have her mom nearby at night. Many people with autism have difficulty adjusting to new situations- even very small transitions can be a challenge to some degree. \n\nA 12 year old who just lost her father and is moving to a whole new place? That's a lot for any kid, but for her it may be amplified even more. And a biiiig time that stress and anxiety tends to manifest is at night. Difficulty sleeping, a spike of anxiety before bed, meltdowns, nightmares and night terrors, disrupted sleep.... It could be a big comfort and help to Rylie to have her mom close by in the same room at night.  \n\nI don't have magical advice on how to get everyone to back off of you while still keeping your room.

MEN WHO WANT TO CONTROL YOUNG WOMEN ARE THRILLED WNEN THINGS ARE BAD AT HOME FOR THEM\u2026\u2026 \n\nAlright, I\u2019ll stop yelling, but babygirl, I am extremely concerned about this. I\u2019m decades older, (literally have a couple of bras older than you), and as a retired high school and college level instructor/counselor, I\u2019ve seen this type of scenario far too many times to count. In fact, a number of years ago, it wasn\u2019t a student actually, but I had a coworker who was murdered by her boyfriend. This coworker actually volunteered as a counselor to women who had gotten involved with bad guys and were fighting to stay clean and live well. Even she had gotten in too deep and didn\u2019t think couldn\u2019t get away, and was too ashamed or embarrassed to tell anyone, or at least that\u2019s what her sister speculated, she told everyone they were broken up, when in fact she was supporting him in her home. \n\nNot always, but most frequently, the type of people who would behave like your boyfriend are in heteronormative relationships with the male clearly in control. The move from him adoring her and doting on her to a relationship that is at the very least unhealthy yet still very possibly deadly starts with small things, then it leads to the young lady QUESTIONING HERSELF. \u201cAm I *really* an inconsiderate asshole?\u201d Then he starts to isolate her from her friends and family. From there, scenarios of course vary widely. Sometimes everything stays lovely until he marries her, impregnates her or otherwise traps her into not being able to leave. From there it can sometimes take years to turn physical, but once it does, rarely, as in practically never, does it stop. \nMany women are killed, but even if a woman is not killed, her spirit might forever be. It\u2019s the chipping away at her soul bit by bit that devastatingly destructive, yet can go unnoticed\u2026..\n\nOP darlin\u2019, of course you deserve better than someone who thinks *you don\u2019t even deserve a bed to sleep in*, but really what you deserve is a YOU who will treat yourself well. When you truly respect and love yourself, guys like him won\u2019t even try with you, because they will be too intimidated by your strength. \n\nKeep your room however you can, (I\u2019m sure the wise redditors here have suggestions- locks talks with mom etc), and while I\u2019m terribly sorry for their loss, if Aunt/cousin keep pushing, keeping telling them to fuck right off. \nBut mostly, keep yourself safe and healthy. You are of the generation who understands that being safe and healthy includes looking after your mental, emotional, and spiritual health as well. \n\nGood luck, this old lady is rooting for you \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "OP shouldn\u2019t be in a hurry to move out.
