This has been understandably hard for her and she struggled to make ends meet. My mom then thought it would be a good idea to let her sister (my aunt) move in with us. We have a fairly big house, not a mansion but we are comfortable in it. But this is when my cousins get involved. My aunt has 3 daughters, Anna (14F), Marie (17F) and Rylie (12F). Rylie is autistic and never have i ever made her feel belittled because of that but growing up, I always felt like everyone favored Rylie for being a miracle baby and her sisters can agree with that. Rylie has always been handed what she wants and it\u2019s never fair. So when they all moved in to our 4 bedroom home, we clearly didn\u2019t have enough room for all of them so Mom and Aunt thought it was a good idea to make me give up MY room so RYLIE can \u201csleep comfortably\u201d. I angrily asked where I would go and why should i give up my room? Aunt told me to sleep on the couch and to be respectful. I replied \u201cWhat the fuck! Rylie can\u2019t keep getting things handed to her. This is my room\u201d. I do regret saying that but in the moment i was so pissed.

As another comment suggested, ask Marie loudly and when mom and aunt are around to go job hunting so you two can get an apartment together.
