Olive Garden has great calamari and breadsticks and salad. The pasta isn\u2019t bad either so I don\u2019t understand the hate. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to go.

It is a perfectly sound choice for dinner!\n\nNTA", "NTA for my 20th birthday my mom asked me where I wanted to go to celebrate and I said Olive Garden. You know what she did?

It wasn\u2019t my birthday but for my last meal out with my parents before I went to boot camp they said we could go anywhere I wanted, expecting me to name one of my favorite restaurants that was on the expensive side. I said I wanted Weinerschnitzel (fast food chili dogs).

Our family always does a hibachi place for birthdays and I was all excited to go there for her birthday. Then she told us she wanted to go to a local owned Italian restaurant instead.

She is acting like an 8th grader.", "Nta happy late birthday", "Lol, doesn't matter, it was *your* birthday. We always got to pick where we wanted to go. My little sister wanted a ritzy place where she ate little,  my brother liked a family steakhouse we often went to, me, the oldest - we had to go to A&W Root Beer! Each year, there were less and we had to drive further. :) But, the deal was the birthday kid got to pick. \n\nFor future dining events...make plans with your friends.

But of course the thing about that is....she can just go whenever she wants and I know neither of us are sure why his mom hinged her opportunity to go there on OP's birthday alone. Odd stuff. \n\nBut yeah that is a good point, the breadsticks and soup/salad do the job right for sure.", "In my world, chain restaurants are never \"fancy.\"  They're what you are sometimes stuck with when you're on the road traveling somewhere.  \n\nFor other people, maybe in rural areas, they could be \"fancy\" just because they're different than eating at home. \n\nMy point is that you can't generalize about what is \"fancy\" and what is not.  \"Fancy\" depends on one's economic class, one's geographic location, one's age, etc.", "Absolutely NTA, something sounds off with your mom to agree to it and then act like that.

Cheesecake factory is even worse IMO since the only reason some dishes taste okay is that they are absolutely loaded with fat and calories. Their chicken alfredo has more than 2,000 calories (OG is 1,500 so still shitty, but not as bad). They also had an alfredo on the fucking kid's menu for years that was over 1,800 calories.

Personally, I'd take the high road, but not much more than a Happy Birthday and small gift.
