Your birthday dinner should be about your preferences, and you have every right to stand up for what you wanted. It's unfortunate that she reacted this way, but you're not in the wrong here.

Does your mom always do stuff like this? \n\nShe and the coworker sound vile. I hope you called up a friend or did something else.\n\nMy mother was crap at birthdays as she used to tell me that no one ever did anything for her so I guess she thought it was okay to move it backward.

Neither of those restaurants are particularly \"fancy,\" they're both in the same level in that sense, so idk what the coworker is talking about, both restaurants are awesome.

I also don't understand why your mom asked where you wanted to go if she already knew she wanted cheesecake factory, it would have been better if she just took you to cheesecake the day of your birthday and that was that. I'm sure you would have been happy regardless, but having the option to choose, only to be shit on, really sucks.

I wish my kid would pick a cheap place for their bday dinners.  My son is always wanting steak, lobster or sushi on his birthday lol.", "NTA. Your mother made this about her bruised ego at work as opposed to celebrating your birthday. You are right: if she forces you to go somewhere else, it\u2019s not really a birthday dinner.

I cried and I didn't want it because I had also gotten paid. But she cried and expected us to accept it because she wanted to give us something for Christmas even if she had nothing. She's had a lot of issues but she has literally gone with nothing to give to us, even if it's very little. My dad was the opposite and would pull the same bs as your mom.
