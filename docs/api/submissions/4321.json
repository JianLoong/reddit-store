I'm a single dad, my wife passed away when our daughter was 2. \n\nmy MIL (60) lives 3 hours away but comes to visit pretty often. My MIL always wanted a \u201cgirly\u201d daughter. My wife was not into traditionally girly things. Neither is my daughter. That doesn't stop MIL from buying her dresses and other things she will never use. \n\nAbout 5 days ago daughter asked if she could maybe dye her hair since it'll fall out soon anyway. I figured why not I talked to a friend who works at a salon... now my daughter has super cool blue hair. She had the biggest smile on her face when she saw her new cool hair. \n\nMIL came to visit yesterday... She freaked out once she saw her daughter\u2019s hair she was saying daughter had such beautiful blonde hair and now it's ugly. Daughter instantly got teary eyed chemo has already been emotionally exhausting for her she didn't need her grandma making comments like that. \n\nI made MIL go in the hallway (we were at the hospital) I told her that was so wrong to call daughter ugly. She started saying well it is ugly. I cut her off and said just leave then if you aren't going to say anything nice... Well, she left and I hugged my daughter and told her she was beautiful. \n\nI later got texts from my BIL me asking why I made MIL leave. I explained the situation, BIL said it was still AH move  to not let MIL see daughter when she is sick and that I probably shouldn't let my 12-year-old have dyed hair anyway.

You did the right thing and it was her choice to leave since she couldn't say anything kind or supportive. Your daughter is lucky to have you as a dad.", "NTA. The behavior you described has me a little agro, and all I did was read about it on Reddit. You handled that with more grace than she deserved. \n\nI hope your daughter gets better.", "NTA. They can go fuck themselves", "NTA.

Especially a kid with cancer and then consider this if her reaction to blue hair is \u201cyou had beautiful blond hair now you look ugly\u201d what will be her reaction when your daughter loses all her hair? Will she say she is ugly without her beautiful girly blond hair?", "Wtf.  You are a great dad.  Keep loving and supporting your daughter and fuck everyone else.\n\nAnyone who thinks it was fine to tell a 12 year old girl with cancer she looks ugly doesn't deserve to see her.  Full stop.  They owe your daughter a heartfelt apology or they can wave at her from the parking lot.", "NTA, top tier dad here.", "NTA Bravo for letting your daughter dye her hair. While I am sorry MIL lost her child, YOU also have a sick child. MIL is not only causing your daughter stress and sadness, but YOU as well. Bad enough having to deal with leukemia let alone this baggage of MIL and her wanting \u201cgirly\u201d girls. Too bad", "NTA. My God. NTA.\nWhat you and your daughter are going through is unimaginably painful.

You\u2019re a great dad. \n\nBlue is a fantastic hair color!", "NTA your daughter needs to be raised up not torn down. If your MIL cant put her granddaughters needs above her own likes for appearance she should stay away. Chemo is ugly and it ruins a person in every way possible if she cant hold her tongue over blue hair whats she going to say when her hair falls out? Or when shes so rugged and tired from chemo and she looks it. I would lay down some law for MIL because its not about her and what she likes or wants. Its about that girl going through the worst part of her life needing to be surrounded by people who care enough about her to raise her up and hold her up.", "NTA.

Good luck!", "When i read the title I was ready to say yta, but fuck that.

NTA. Best wishes", "Nta, you stoop up for your kid and helped them do something that makes them happy.", "NTA. You didn't tell her to leave, you gave her a completely understandable and valid ultimatum - be nice to her sick granddaughter or leave. She chose leaving over being nice. That is 100% on her, not you.", "Nta!!! Keep supporting your daughter in whatever ways make her feel strong and beautiful.", "NTA.  You did something that made your daughter happy during a very emotional time for her and I think that is wonderful.  Coloring her hair isn't permanent and isn't life altering like having leukemia.  I would send out a group text stating that while undergoing treatment you will require all visits to be positive and uplifting or they will not be happening.  Your daughter does not need negativity in her life.", "NTA you didn\u2019t really make MIL leave, you told her to leave if she couldn\u2019t say anything nice and she chose to leave.", "NTA. Not at all. If your daughter wants it, she should get it.\n\nIf you can, tip for vibrant hair colors: dry shampoo. Don't wash with water for a week If that's possible. Shower or bath of course, but skip the hair more often than not.", "NTA  By MIL's way of thinking, your daughter will be ugly when her hair falls out. Your daughter has a terrific dad who supports her. I'd keep MIL away. Far away.", "NTA, you need to stick up for your daughter", "You went from zero to kick out pretty quick. You skipped right over \"then you can keep your mouth shut about it {the ugly hair)\" and jumped straight to \"then you can leave\".
