If you go to a restaurant 30 min before close, you can\u2019t expect them to serve you food/cocktails after you eat-they\u2019re closed! To be honest, if I go to a restaurant 30 min before close, I better be eating quickly or getting it to go.

Sounds like your workplace needs a defined written policy that includes what to do at closing when a customer remains, how to handle it exactly, and how long you're expected to stay and what happens when that time is exceeded.  Why is an employee making these decisions?  Should be decided on and understood by everyone working there.   This can't be the first time this has happened in a service business.\n\n\"Sarah your shift is from 16:00 until 22:30.   We close at 22:00 so we take last orders at 21:55 and the ovens are turned off at 22:00 unless there is still a pizza cooking and then turned off after that one comes out.  Make an announcement at that time that the restaurant closes at 10pm so we can't take any further orders after that point.  If a customer remains at 10:30 politely remind them that we closed at 10pm and have to lock the doors now.\"   If management hasn't done that then they only have themselves to blame.   Not that hard, look I came up with a policy (not arguing it's the right policy, but a policy nonetheless) in about 5 minutes.", "What could you have done differently that would still have you complying with the directives you have been given by your management? NTA.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m working off a base assumption here that a) you provide decent customer service and don\u2019t talk to people like rubbish, and b) where you work isn\u2019t a fancy sort of sit down restaurant but more of a laid back sort of vibe (mostly because you called it a pizza joint and not an Italian restaurant or something similar). \n\nI\u2019ve been managing hospitality venues for 5 years (albeit in the UK and from the language it sounds like you\u2019re North American) and this is more leeway than a lot of people get. In most places that aren\u2019t the swanky sort, if you\u2019re hanging around that far past closing you\u2019ll be gently but firmly told it\u2019s time to go. I have regional managers to answer to, and if I used an extra half an hour of labour for five (at least) people that\u2019s 2.5 pointless extra hours of wages I\u2019m going to be expected to explain, and \u201cone solitary guy wanted to watch TV after closing\u201d is not a good enough reason to damage my business\u2019 p&l. If you have multiple locations, I\u2019d imagine someone (probably your GM) has to answer questions like that too. \n\nEven if he expected to be able to finish his meal (which is reasonable) everywhere has a licence in place that means they can\u2019t serve drinks past a certain time, and the expectation is that the venue closes at that cutoff. Why would he be offered dessert 30 mins after closing? \n\nAs for the check, it\u2019s not like you stood there tapping your foot with a card reader. You gave him his check, said it was for when he was ready and then (presumably) charged him after he was done. I have to close my tills by a certain time so I\u2019m not surprised you printed it off for him at all. \n\nYou said you had a manager on shift with you - any issues in your behaviour would\u2019ve been brought up by them, and if not, they\u2019re the person your GM needs to speak to regarding expectations of the business. \n\nThe review complaint is a power play. He\u2019s hoping you get in trouble, which is why he didn\u2019t say anything at the time or email your venue directly. If he was genuinely hurt, didn\u2019t realise and felt slighted or any other non-entitled interpretation he could\u2019ve resolved it quickly and quietly - as most people do when they genuinely just have some feedback they want to address. Shaming on a public forum is a Decision in and of itself and screams of entitlement same as the rest of this. He doesn\u2019t value your or your coworker\u2019s time, money, or life balance. Most places have reduced transport etc on a Sunday, so he\u2019s clearly not respecting that he\u2019s making it more difficult for you and your coworkers to get home late at night either. \n\nAs for your GM (and the company) it sounds like their duty of care and people management is crap, and I really hope you find somewhere that treats you like a person and not a payroll number \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA. Bar patrons know the rules. That guy was just being a jerk. In many locations, we would be required to make the customers leave.", "All depends on your businesses policy. I've worked at places where everyone needed to be out the door at closing time and others where we were expected to remain at our posts until the very last customer choose to leave. Your manager was there so they should have advised you on the procedure.\n\nYou are only an A H if you knew this wasn't your businesses procedure but did it anyway, otherwise NTA and if you do get questioned about the review direct then to your manager who was present.", "Yeah they cater to jerk customers unfortunately which is sad honestly. I\u2019ve been job searching already actually, hopefully a new gig lands soon \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc", "I\u2019m the same way, if it\u2019s 60-30 minutes before close I will do carry out or just go somewhere else if it\u2019s an option. \nThey (one individual ) knew the closing time.", "Yeah the most I would do is get a drink while waiting for the food to cook. Rude af to do more than that.", "Worst part is this person said they\u2019re in the service industry also", "Unfortunately they paid with cash and left. The manager may be able to look up when I printed the check off though I\u2019m not sure.

The server that was there also got scolded this morning, I know mine is waiting for me.

That\u2019s just bizarre.", "I've heard that sometimes people in the service industry are more assholes because they've dealt with assholes and they want to be the asshole.", "Oh that makes him even more of a [can't say,  the mods will pearl-clutch]. I've worked customer service before, and it's like muscle memory--I hate going **anywhere** within 30 minutes of closing. Grocery store,  post office,restaurant...it's not happening. I've had friends try the \"but it's still open!\" song with me before but I'm unmoved.  Yeah, it's open--and those folks have worked a full shift and are trying to wrap up the day so they can go live their life. I am NOT the one going in there and undoing work that's already done.", "Well, if you have cameras, that would certainly establish when the patron left!", "That  sucks.  Next  time  leavevthe tv off\ud83d\ude42", "That's ok too as long as there is guidance on how to handle it, employees know it before they are hired, and are scheduled appropriately to be able to handle the extra prolonged time.  I'm going to guess, however, that you are in the US and paid mostly by tips so once the order flow stops so does your paycheck so you probably aren't going to be ok just sitting there for multiple hours after close.  Also doesn't make much sense for most for profit business, hence the value of a written policy on shutting it down and moving people out :-)", "I would understand being upset if we were doing that at like 9:45 or something; But that wasn\u2019t the case. And the temperature of the building, I literally have no control over", "I suppose some could be, but that's definitely never been my experience. I feel like the opposite is true and most go out of their way not to be an asshole because they know what it's like to deal with asshole customers. Most people who work in restaurants or bars tip far better than other customers and are generally much more understanding and patient.", "Agreed. 1000%  Us industry folk don\u2019t benefit from staying an extra 30-60 minutes when we make below minimum wage", "I should\u2019ve! It didn\u2019t benefit me to turn it back on", "Like I said, a dick."]}
