He is the AH.", "It feels like there\u2019s a lot of missing info or context here", "It's not an issue that he wants to spend the day with his eldest 2 and be later home sometimes. It is an issue that he told his 4 year old he would be there before bedtime. Don't make promises you can't keep especially with a child, their little brains aren't developed enough to understand . It would have been better for him to arrange daddy night a different night to be safe. Perhaps he didn't intend to hurt the 4 year old and made the same mistake a lot of us grown ups make, saying what the child wants to hear thinking they will forget. Usually they remember. Maybe try and have a discussion for future and arrange daddy nights for when he can guarantee to be home. Deffo he should spend plenty of time with his older 2 as well though and not let them down either as they are all his children", "Make it clear to him that you are not asking him to cut his time short with his kids, you\u2019re asking him to stay true to his word. So if he can\u2019t be sure, he will be home for bedtime, he just needs to say that he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be home for bedtime, and it might not be daddy bedtime. Make clear that all you want is predictable consistency for the four year old.", "I feel like there's a whole bunch missing from this story", "Hes major red flags  Nta for that alone", "If he keeps on she\u2019ll remember these broken promises the rest of her life. NTA. He needs to keep his mouth shut and do better, and he can add not lashing out at you for his own failings to his list of things to fix.", "NTA dude needs to be more careful as you say. She's 4. Also he's not showing he can stick to his word.", "At face value, NTA.  It's reasonable to try to protect your daughter from disappointment, and it sounds like this isn't a one-off situation, but chronic behavior.  \n\nThe only wrinkle here is that on this occasion he happened to be out with his other children from, I assume, another relationship.  Reading between the lines, it sounds like, from his perspective,  you are trying to curtail his relationship with his other children by leveraging the child you share together.  I have no idea whether that's true or not, but it would explain his explosive anger.  I guess you might ask yourself whether you are only frustrated by this behavior when his other children are involved.\n\nSome unsolicited advice that you can take or leave:  You have done what you can do by alerting him to the fact that his behavior is harmful to his relationship with your daughter.  Whether or not he acts differently moving forward is up to him.   I've lived on this planet long enough to know that it's nearly impossible to force another adult to change.  They have to want to do it themselves.  I also have learned that children, even 4-year-olds, are smarter than you think.  Your daughter will figure out on her own that she can't rely on her dad.  She will probably be disappointed, and it will shape their interactions moving forward.  There's nothing you can do here to prevent it, beyond letting the man experience the consequences of his actions.  You never know.  Maybe he'll learn something.", "NTA, poor lil one", "NTA. How is it your fault that he feels bad for effectively lying to his child? That is a MASSIVE red flag. He needs to realize that if he keeps acting this way, his daughter will grow up to resent him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He shouldn\u2019t be making promises he knows he can\u2019t keep. It\u2019s also super not smart of you guys to hold his bedtime nights on the days he\u2019s with her other children. it quite literally makes zero sense. He definitely can\u2019t cut his time with his oldest short either because that\u2019ll make them feel neglected. so y\u2019all need to schedule your times better.", "NTA. He\u2019s teaching your child that he is unreliable. When she grows up she will believe that people are unreliable, particularly men. He should not be making promises he cannot keep to a young child.", "I feel there is a lot missing from this.  How often does your husband have his eldest 2 kids?  How often does your daughter have your husband for bedtime?  Does he make bedtime promises frequently?  Are the only times he misses bedtime with your daughter the days he has his other 2 kids?", "NTA- constantly making promises, regardless how small, and then breaking them is going to damage your child on the long term.", "NTA. He should not make promises he cannot keep. He sounds like a 4-year-old.", "INFO: Are you hyping up daddy being home by bedtime all day long while he's away with his other kids? If so, you also bear blame in disappointing your child.", "Aaah I see. Then he needs better time management skills. Or planning. Or both. \ud83e\udd37IDK. He needs to figure something out his daughter will grow up to resent for not keeping his promise.", "Also let the guy do what he wants my girlfriend let\u2019s me do what I want because she loves me when I get home I spend time with her and then I\u2019ll play some video games", "Oh boo hoo who\u2019s the 4 year old here?", "This is why you should get a job instead of being a stay at home being a stay at home parent is not hard", "NTA. It sounds like he is prioritizing the eldest two over the youngest. He had no reason to blow up over you asking to try to be home by bedtime. It sounds very sus to me.", "NTA - This looks like a pattern where he lashes out when he is embarrassed about being wrong. He should recognize that and fix it.", "As adults we say things and sometimes it does not go as planned and we can explain and move on. With children when we say something they usually take it very literal. So it is understandable that with him saying that and you wanting to be sure you checked in. He needs to understand that blowing off a promise to the little one will be just as hurtful as cutting his time with his older ones. He did not need to respond in that way and I do not think you are wrong so NTA..", "NTA do not make promises to kids that you cannot keep as a child will only see the promise that was made to them not the other factors. If you cannot 100% promise to be there do not make said promise as for a child it will only lead to disappointment.", "NTA, he shouldn't say it if he isn't going to do it. Children quickly learn when parents don't do what they say they will, and easily develop issues that can include trust, confidence, and self-worth. Children learn from their parents, if they can't rely on them, then they can't rely on anyone.", "Nta it sucks but your going to have to accept her dad will be her biggest disappointment. You Have to decide if this is something you can accept from a partner", "Why the 4 yr old couldn\u2019t go with him to hang with the siblings", "YTA so on the limited time he has with his oldest kids you expect him to cut it short for his youngest who he sees everyday?", "NTA. I think people are asking lots of questions, though, because this story makes zero sense.\n\nYour daughter's father promised her he'd be putting her to bed tonight in spite of having a long drive to keep a commitment to his older kids, she was super hyped because she's four, and he got mad when you checked in to remind him of his promise.\n\nThat's not how this should go, but I don't see how you doing anything differently would have resulted in a different outcome.\n\nIs it common for your husband to make promises and then not keep them? Four year olds (especially precocious ones) are obsessed with what you tell them and they will hold you to account down to the tiniest detail. Obviously as parents you have to navigate this in ways that are building trust with your kids but also setting the foundation for ideas around people being fallible and all of that. But... wow. Unless there's something else going on, I'd be deeply concerned that he made a promise he shouldn't have and then blew up about it.\n\nA sit down conversation definitely seems in order and if that doesn't feel productive, you probably need to start assessing why and what you want to be building for yourself and your kiddo.", "Yeah like why can\u2019t they change \u201cdaddy bedtime\u201d to a day when he\u2019s not driving hours away. Or why can\u2019t his kids come to his house and maybe sleep over? He could leave an hour earlier to go see them and come back an hour earlier. He could just not say that to his daughter or she could stay up an hour later on the weekend. So many questions", "It's honestly got nothing to do with the eldest 2 as far as I'm concerned.  He could have been doing anything today - you don't tell that babe that you'll be home for bedtime if you're not home for bedtime. I don't care what you're doing, honestly.   The only time, imo, it's acceptable to let a child down (including his eldest 2) is in a genuine emergency.", "Yes, he sees them a lot. And we usually take turns for bedtime and tonight was meant to be my bedtime, he's the one who said he'd be back for bedtime.", "I couldn't exactly pop along whilst he was spending time with his kids?", "I never once mentioned to her he'd be doing bedtime tonight, so how's that on me? He solely made the decision before he left. I was more than happy to do her bedtime. I love bedtime!", "Nope. She was asking. She's almost 4, so she's very much at that age where she won't forget what you've told her.", "She literally included in her post that HE told the kid he would be home for bedtime", "You, apparently.", "Absolutely not prioritised them at all.  He was spending much needed time with them without me and my daughter being there.  What annoyed me was the promise of Daddy bedtime.", "Yeah seems like the simplest solution is to just not make promises you can\u2019t keep. Seems like a classic case of a parent wanting to hype up their kid so they can feel like a hero, only to not follow through and letting their partner deal with the fallout. If Daddy keeps it up though, his daughter\u2019s eventually gonna realize he\u2019s full of crap and he\u2019s got commitment issues. Toddlers are forgiving and forgetful, but they grow up fast. If he wants to continue being her hero, he should start acting like the man his daughter thinks he is", "Do you feed it to your little one? Like, do you say to her, well he will be here bc he said he would? If anything when he says it in the morning, that\u2019s the time to nip it in the bud. Afterwards, say, well he will definitely try to be here, but sometimes traffic is bad. Daddy loves you anyway. It\u2019s better to set realistic expectations with the kid so that they\u2019re not worrying about it all day and disappointed. And it\u2019s better to correct your husbands impractical promises in the moment, and then speak with him privately.", "I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s on you? I quite literally said he shouldn\u2019t be making promises he can\u2019t keep. And based off of context it seems you guys alternate who does her bedtime. why hold HIS bedtime on nights when you guys know he\u2019s traveling far and trying to spend as much possible time with his children? you guys BOTH need to come together and see what\u2019s best for your child on the days he\u2019s gone.", "I wonder if it's about his promise to YOUR 4 years old or about him being with his other kids whom are NOT yours and you wanted to make sure he doesn't really enjoy his time with them.  Otherwise, why would you text him to remind him and spoil his time with his kids ? He made a promise, and it's up to him to keep it, and if he didn't, he is the one who has to explain to his daughter. Butt out of his relationship with his other kids. You signed on this when you married a man with children. I don't believe that your motive is altruistic as you try to pretend.", "She should fix that in the moment.", "It sounded to me like he does it when he's home on time and often he isn't presumably because of work", "\u201cWhy would you text him\u201d she clearly says the daughter is upset because dad says he\u2019ll be home for bedtime and then he\u2019s not. She\u2019s obviously looking out for her child", "The reason we weren't with him was because I fully appreciate that he needs time with them without me and my daughter there, yet you're accusing me of trying to spoil his relationship with his kids? Are you actually insane?  You have NO idea what my relationship is like with my stepchildren (who I've known most of their lives).  It's not \"MY DAUGHTER\".  It is OUR DAUGHTER and they're not just his kids to me, they are my stepchildren.", "What do you mean?", "Again, I wonder if it's about that or that husband is spending his time with his other kids, so I should be the evil step mom from Disney. I don't know if it's a habit to ruin his time with his kids, and this is why he lashed out at her.", "So interrupt him when he\u2019s promising and say \u201coh this isn\u2019t a good night for daddy bedtime. Let\u2019s do that tomorrow!\u201d So that your daughter has 5 seconds between him saying that and he expectations being reset.  He\u2019s not good at not overcommitting.  Help him out for the sake of your kid. Don\u2019t just sit back and wait for consequences to hit both of them.", "I agree x"]}
