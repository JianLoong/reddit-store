It would have been better for him to arrange daddy night a different night to be safe. Perhaps he didn't intend to hurt the 4 year old and made the same mistake a lot of us grown ups make, saying what the child wants to hear thinking they will forget. Usually they remember. Maybe try and have a discussion for future and arrange daddy nights for when he can guarantee to be home.

It's reasonable to try to protect your daughter from disappointment, and it sounds like this isn't a one-off situation, but chronic behavior.  \n\nThe only wrinkle here is that on this occasion he happened to be out with his other children from, I assume, another relationship.  Reading between the lines, it sounds like, from his perspective,  you are trying to curtail his relationship with his other children by leveraging the child you share together.  I have no idea whether that's true or not, but it would explain his explosive anger.  I guess you might ask yourself whether you are only frustrated by this behavior when his other children are involved.\n\nSome unsolicited advice that you can take or leave:  You have done what you can do by alerting him to the fact that his behavior is harmful to his relationship with your daughter.  Whether or not he acts differently moving forward is up to him.   I've lived on this planet long enough to know that it's nearly impossible to force another adult to change.  They have to want to do it themselves.  I also have learned that children, even 4-year-olds, are smarter than you think.  Your daughter will figure out on her own that she can't rely on her dad.  She will probably be disappointed, and it will shape their interactions moving forward.  There's nothing you can do here to prevent it, beyond letting the man experience the consequences of his actions.  You never know.  Maybe he'll learn something.", "NTA, poor lil one", "NTA.

Four year olds (especially precocious ones) are obsessed with what you tell them and they will hold you to account down to the tiniest detail. Obviously as parents you have to navigate this in ways that are building trust with your kids but also setting the foundation for ideas around people being fallible and all of that. But... wow.

If Daddy keeps it up though, his daughter\u2019s eventually gonna realize he\u2019s full of crap and he\u2019s got commitment issues. Toddlers are forgiving and forgetful, but they grow up fast.

It sort of works, although she is evidently exhausted from travelling come Monday and it takes her a couple of days to recover. At the moment, she has a free day on Monday/Tuesday, so it's not too much of an issue, but she's almost 4 and she starts school next year and I need to discuss this now rather than spring my views on my husband and stepkids last-minute, because when she starts school there is no way I think she'll cope with going fortnightly and then go into school getting home 8pm or later on a Sunday having travelled, but I know they'll all be devastated to see each other less.\n\n In fairness, my stepkids are also getting to that age where they want to see their friends more, which unfortunately means we often go up and back in one day rather than having them overnight with family and means 7+ hours in the car in one day for her.\n\nSo, AITA to suggest this?

So if he does promise it he has to mean it.", ">isn't leaving his oldest 2 to go tuck in the child he lives with everyday not letting them down also?\n\nNot if he hadn't promised them that he'd be there for particular period of time. The oldest 2 kids presumably know that the visit with Dad is going to end, and Dad's going to go home. Following through on that isn't letting them down. \n\nIf he *had* promised his oldest 2 the time with them, and if making it home in time for \"Daddy bedtime\" would mean cutting the visit short... Then Dad shouldn't have made promises to his 3 children that he had no way of fulfilling.", "I was going to ask this same thing\u2026 OP are you setting the youngest up to BE disappointed?? You don\u2019t say WHY this happens as often as it does. Maybe you need to set up time that your husband can actually make happen. It almost sounds as if you are forcing this particular situation and using the child as a way to guilt him.", "I don\u2019t really understand this. She is texting him to remind him to keep his promise tonight. How could this be done any other time?  \n\nPresumably he would have broken his promise and then she could have the conversation?", "Are you not reading what OP wrote? She is not holding his bedtime on nights when he\u2019s not going to be there. He\u2019s doing it to himself. How is any of this on her?", "But her husband is the one making these promises with time he doesn\u2019t have? Why is it on OP to set up a time that works for him when he won\u2019t take any personal accountability?", "That would be the time to explain that daddy is trying really hard to get back in time.", "Because her child\u2019s happiness matters more in that moment", "I think there is a lot of information missing in OP\u2019s original post that Is coming out in other comments. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t have a rotating agreement about bed time (as she mentioned in her previous comment) and figure out a different time for her husband to spend time with the younger child. As OP mentions\u2026 this is a recurring problem - so what they\u2019re currently doing isn\u2019t working.", "I mean that\u2019s quite a big assumption to make, don\u2019t you think? You have literally nothing to base that on", "Okay but OP isn\u2019t the one making false promises. It was her night for bedtime in the first place, her husband changed that. They clearly already have a plan in place and he is the one disturbing it. You can set up all the plans you want, it doesn\u2019t matter when the other person isn\u2019t following them.", "Agreed about the missing information. But I\u2019d say the reoccurring problem is the husband going against the plan, not the plan itself. OP says in a comment it was originally her night for bedtime. If he had just stuck to the plan they made together there wouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "The dad is absolutely wrong to make that promise. Mom\u2019s priority in that moment should be to avoid her child feeling that disappointment. \n\nI\u2019m unable to express what I mean correctly. Earlier this week on the TwoX sub there was a wonderful share of a mom who\u2019s ex\u2019s girlfriend stepped up to give their son a birthday surprise and gifts from mom and dad when they were unable to be there. That\u2019s the sentiment I mean to express. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/s/K2vKBDNO32\n\nAs a parent, you step up and put your child\u2019s emotional needs ahead of anything else. Dad is torn between his children. This mom has an opportunity to make her child feel loved, instead the child is left sad and disappointed. It\u2019s absolutely the dad\u2019s fault. Mom can mitigate it though. Instead it comes across as her guilting dad. He should feel guilty. In the moment though the priority is off here", "I 100% agree with your sentiment. But what should she be doing differently to mitigate it? When they make a plan he goes against it. What can she change here?", "She can change her reaction to it."]}
