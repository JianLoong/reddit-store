This infection is only found in cats who go outdoors and hunt prey, such as mice and other rodents.

With due precautions the risk is very minimal. I'm not saying that catching this disease from the cat isn't possible. It's possible but far from easy since the cat must be within 15 days of expulsion of the oocysts, there should be climatic conditions favorable to maturation, the feces must remain in the litter box for 2-3 days (if they're scooped up immediately after, they aren't dangerous) and at this point one must accidentally ingest the oocysts after handling the poop.\n\nIt's certainly easier to contract toxoplasmosis by eating raw meat or badly washed vegetables.", "okay yeah i see what you\u2019re saying. i guess i just needed this sort of rational response. thank you and i\u2019ll try and compromise with my mom", "sorry, she booked the trip for 2 weeks time but it\u2019s only for 2 nights. sorry if i didn\u2019t explain that clearly. also im sure my bf wouldn\u2019t mind if i asked him, thanks for suggesting!", "so i should be fine then! it\u2019s a house cat so i\u2019m assuming cleaner than an outdoor cat", "no, i wouldn\u2019t of thrown the cat out if he lived with me, it would of been a conversation with my boyfriend about it he could empty the cat litter while im pregnant. of course after my pregnancy, i would take over as he\u2019s my cat, my responsibility.", "i actually have no idea to be honest, it\u2019s my first pregnancy and im being overly cautious. im sure pregnant people have cats but maybe they pee outside", "NTA.

They were great to her, giving her lots of attention.  In fact one of the two times we boarded her there, they looked at her records, realized her birthday was happening, and threw a 19th birthday party for her, complete with decorations and catnip.\n\nI confess I teared up when they texted me the picture of Lucy at her party.\n\nShe's been gone a couple of years now -- she had a stroke and we had to have her put down -- but she made it to age 20.", "YTA - get mum to clean it before she leaves and add extra litter.
