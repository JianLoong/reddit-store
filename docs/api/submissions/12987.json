The bottle?\n\n\"He's babying her and that's sucky behavior.\" If your mom were to smack poison out of your hand, is that \"babying\" you and \"sucky behavior\"?", "too much soy sauce is toxic", "Just to be clear, it was a plastic bottle. It went all over the floor because it fell opening side down.\n\nI take the rest of your feedback.", "Why would you still willingly let someone get sick?", "Did you read your own link? Because it says in some people, even 1 - 2 cups of soy sauce could be fatal", "It's not clear to me how you inferred that I was \"hanging out with them\".", "God you\u2019re insufferable, go yell at birds or something", "And that's why you should stop assuming.", "That person is tripping.\n\nIf someone says \"Hey I'm gonna jump off this building, i probably won't die\" He/She'll say \"I shouldn't save that person, they're an adult, touching them is assault.\" even if it's a loved one.\n\nGreat way of thinking.", "They\u2019re not being serious, they\u2019re doing a bit to make people mad because it gives them emotional satisfaction.", "[deleted]", "No, birds are cool.

Being a jackass and straight up threatining your own life are 2 different things.\n\nI wouldn't ever let anyone i know potentially die in front of me. If they're not okay with that, we can break up. But i would guess if you're not a psycho, you shouldn't be pissed about someone genuinly thinking about your well being. Them protecting you from death is given in relationships.\n\nEdit: Someone doing something regularlay like parkour, is not the same as someone doing a threatining thing out of a dare. The first one you know what you're getting into, 2nd you don't."]}
