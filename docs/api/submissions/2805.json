This was the first time I\u2019ve ever met one of his friends. We\u2019ve been dating for 5yrs and he knows all my friends. \n\nI showed up as a surprise because I got off work early and he always said that he wished I could visit. He had office hours during that time so I was looking forward to just hanging out and maybe watching him teach. When I got there there was nobody in there accept K and they were just talking. \n\nHe was surprised that I showed up but he introduced the two of us and it sort of awkward as though I was interrupting them because I was told that it was K\u2019s bday and that they had plans after the office hours ended. He never mentioned that but if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have shown up that day.\n\nAnyway, this was technically his OHs so I thought it\u2019d be fun to ask a few math problems (like long division) which ended up being funny because he couldn\u2019t figure it out immediately. I teased him about it.\n\nAfter OHs ended, we left and bf was like \u201cwe were going to see a movie if you want to join\u201d. I didn\u2019t want to third wheel their plans, so since they were parked a lot closer to campus than I was I said I\u2019d walk to my car and let them know once I got there. Bf said he\u2019d drive me to my spot, then K messaged him saying that a mutual friend to them called and made plans that night, so no movie. I felt really bad about that, since that ended up being made up.\n\nI guess over the weekend, K messages bf about how she \u201chated that I was always putting bf down\u201d and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t like seeing bf get treated that way [by me]\u201d. he showed me and was confused. I guess it was about me teasing about his inability to do long division. I was really upset because one 1) we are both very mutually sarcastic and make fun of each other 2) I had spent the previous day stressing out about making K disappointed about her bday so wtf. \n\nI was also more upset that bf did not defend me. All he said was \u201cI think she was just doing that in front of you for some reason\u201d. He didn\u2019t disagree with her. He didn\u2019t explain that that is how we joke around (god knows the kinds of things he has said to me). He didn\u2019t tell her it was none of K\u2019s business. He didn\u2019t say anything remotely positive to defend me.\n\nI pointed it out and he didn\u2019t seem to care, that it didn\u2019t matter. I told him the about times I\u2019ve defended him with some of my people and why couldn\u2019t he do the same? He eventually just said \u201cwe\u2019re always sarcastic with each other so it\u2019s fine\u201d but only after I complained so it felt more like when a parent forces their kid to give an apology. He thinks I\u2019m overreacting. He got cold because \u201che can\u2019t deal with arguing\u201d and it\u2019s hurtful because any conversation about expectations gets shut down because he thinks it\u2019s arguing. I told him that his defense was pathetic and to reflect on his behavior. he\u2019s now ignoring me.

He hasn't introduced you to his friends in FIVE YEARS?\n2. You surprise him at work & he is going to see a movie with a female \"friend\" without you?\n3. It sounds very much like he has been complaining to her about you\n4. He shuts down any conversation about expectations\n\nIt is pretty obvious that the two of you have different views on your relationship, and if you're looking for an actual commitment, I recommend looking elsewhere, because I'm pretty sure you aren't his only gf.", "You\u2019ve been together for 5 years and NEVER met one of his friends?\n\nGurl, YTA for missing that huge red flag.\n\nReally?", "If teasing is natural for you 2, then I see nothing wrong.  My wife and I tease each other all the time.   There are limits in front of others but that pertains to personal stuff.    Long division is not personal.   \n\nI'd be concerned that he didn't defend you.   Priority should always go to the GF/wife.   He is dating you, not her.  \n\nAlso, what's up with him never introducing you to his friends?    5years is a long term relationship and still no friend meets?   That's super weird.  \n\nNTA.   He is a bit of an AH for not defending you.\n\nEdit: some men can be a bit fragile when it comes to being made fun of in front of friends.   That his problem though, but you should be considerate of it.    That said, if you never met any of his friends, you cant know how he acts around them.    You'd have to assume the same way he acts with you.", "You shouldn't have made fun of him in front of his colleague and he should have defended you. You're both the assholes. ESH", "So you interrupted your boyfriend right before he was going to take his other girlfriend on a date, and now he's gaslighting you? Okie dokie, I think I got the picture. Lol. NTA but please open your eyes.", "Yta, because this isn't really your place,  you haven't met his friends in 5 years? That is a clear signal that you are not his SO. \n\nI am confused about your thoughts of not wanting to be a third wheel,  but wanting to keep your options open until you get to your car? \n\nAlso,  asking bf the teacher questions and then laughing when he doesn't know the answer is not funny. K is right about your behavior, it's mean", "Your bf is TA for not defending you and instead making you look bad. YTA for calling him pathetic. That was the insult, imo.", "YTA\n\nI think you need to chalk this up to learning to \u201cread the room\u201d.\n\nMy wife and I tease each others but we\u2019d never insult each others intelligence (in a joking manner) in front of people who aren\u2019t in on how we are.\n\nTo the other person present, You walked up and immediately started insulting him and making him look stupid. They\u2019re not in on anything and to them it looked serious. \n\nSo in the other person\u2019s mind, you are someone always putting him down. \n\nThe fact that you have never met his friends is weird (especially after five years).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I addressed the friend thing in a couple other comments. Also he studies a math heavy field. It is funny where you\u2019re so advanced into your work you forget the basics.

The silence and awkwardness caught me off guard. That\u2019s my fault", "That's fair.   Those circumstances don't make it seem weird.  Thanks for the update!", "Um... yeah... go back and re-read those texts. Even if they are only friends, sounds like the girl definitely wants more."]}
