Leaving something as cheap as fairy lights on at all times is a fire hazard, and completely unnecessary. While occasionally forgetting when you're in a rush in the morning is forgivable, there is no excuse when you're leaving for the entire weekend. It's not so much the actual environmental damage caused nor the cost, but you have to realise this behaviour is the outside manifestation of a massively wasteful and selfish attitude that your roommates find insulting. I would recommend purchasing a switch button for your power socket, so you can switch it off more easily (it works like a socket adapter - but with a switch).", "YTA its not just an environment thing its a fire hazard! How hard is it to switch something off as you leave the room?? If the plugs out of reach maybe get a smart plug. It's stupid really \ud83d\ude44. Just turn the damn thing off when leaving the room!!", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nCome on, you're so rushed that you can't turn them off? She's right that it's a waste of energy, but it's also a potential fire hazard. It's also very inconsiderate to just leave them on all the time.", "I have to say YTA here.  Rushing for class every day isn\u2019t a valid excuse to not flip a simple switch.  I also suspect it\u2019s more often than that since you said \u201cleave it on at all times.\u201d  Sounds more like laziness.  In addition to the environmental concerns, those cheap lights could burn the house down!", "YTA, The lights do not need to be on when no one is there.  Just bc you and your housemates are not paying for the electricity directly does not mean you are not paying for it- it is factored into what you do pay, and if the energy bills go up people will have to pay more down the line.\n\nIt's wasteful and inconsiderate.", "Yta. Sorry, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a hassle to turn them on and off each time, but we live in a time where we know the damage we do to our planet and many of us are trying to minimize that damage. Turning your fairy lights off when you leave for multiple days seems like a VERY easy thing to do!", "Can you get a timer so they are off most of the time?  Why leave them on if you're not home?", "YTA, especially for the possible fire hazard (which is definitely everyone's business). Leaving the lights on for a whole weekend while no one's there is a risk. Fire hazard aside, even if you're paying all-in utilities fees, that doesn't mean you have a free pass to use however much electricity or water you want without it having any environmental impact", "Get a wireless plug thing (can't think of the name) and you can hang the remote next to door and click it when you leave. We got a 3 pack at Walmart and it makes it handy. But yta", "YTA. You're an adult. Turn off the lights when you leave the room.", "Every year you hear on the news that a whole family has died for leaving on their Christmas lights. It\u2019s way too dangerous to leave.

YTA, but it\u2019s an easy fix.", "Soft YTA, she's right, it is unnecessarily wasteful. Maybe spend a few dollars on a timer so you can program them to be off when you're not enjoying them", "YTA. Environmental concerns aside, it's a fire hazard. Small lights are capable of overheating and starting fires. It happens every year with Christmas setups. There are plenty of ways to make sure the lights are off when you leave, and if you can't keep up with them, maybe save them for when your life is less busy?", "I sympathize with you; I had fairy lights myself for many years, but your roommate is right that they shouldn't be on unattended. Just get a cheap outlet timer for everyday, then you only have to remember to unplug them when you go away. (And if you have the funds (I know they're more expensive) you could get LED fairy lights, which use less energy and don't get hot. (They also don't burn out like regular ones do, which is nice.))", "yta.   Environmental considerations, however small, are everybody's business.  Roommate's concern isn't about cost.   It's about the environment.  It seems to me, a small thing to do what your roommate has requested.   The saving is a tiny impact on the environment.  The respect of your roommate's concern has a large impact on your relationship.", "YTA It's a fire hazard. Turning a switch on/off isn't that much of a hassle. Please be more responsible.", "YTA.

They're so annoying and cause eye strain and make it hard to sleep. Please turn them off", "It is none of her business. But, why would you be so wasteful and leave lights on all day when you're not even there? What's so hard about flipping a switch?  If the plug is inaccessible, get a powerstrip so you can easily reach the switch.", "YTA. Forget about energy conservation, that\u2019s a fire hazard.", "NTA I think everyone in the comments are missing a very important point: fairy lights, in my experience, are almost exclusively LEDs. Their power usage is negligible at best. They don\u2019t create heat either so the fire risk is also insignificant. This isn\u2019t affecting or endangering anyone else.", "YTA", "INFO: how does she know they\u2019re on? Is she going into your space while you\u2019re gone? I feel like people are overlooking that part", "ESH, because the lights probably don\u2019t use that much energy but also this is an easy problem to solve by using one of those timer plugs which are cheap at any hardware store or Target or wherever. You can set it so the lights automatically switch off during the day and only turn on at night.", "It\u2019s easy to turn off the lights or put them on a timer (yes even if they don\u2019t come with the feature built in, you buy a timer that you plug into the outlet, you plug the lights into the timer), but the amount of electricity used by the lights is negligible so if your roommate truly cared about the environment then she would care about more important things:\n\nfor the following I\u2019m assuming 16 weeks (just basing it off my academic calendar and adding a week for good measure) for the semester which is 105 days, 2,520 hours\n\nYour lights use 0.006 kW per hour, so if you run them 24/7 in that time period you get: **15.12 kWh**\n\nA hot water heater (I guarantee the university uses electric cause the other option is gas and it\u2019s much too expensive for that many people) uses 4 kW per hour and for an average household will run ~3 hours a day, over the time period that gives us: **5,040 kWh**\n\nMaybe your roommate should be getting everyone to take colder and shorter showers since that\u2019ll have a real impact, but again, it is *really* not hard to turn off your lights or put them on a timer.

This roommate also better be unplugging their microwave when not in use, because energy waste to that is comparable and I'd *hate* for them to be a hypocrite while policing their roommates' energy usage.
