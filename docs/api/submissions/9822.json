He\u2019s been planning for it for about 3 weeks. Usually I do all the laundry and take care of our flat in terms of cleaning.\n\nOn Wednesday he told me he wanted to wear a very specific blazer and it was in the bin to be washed. I usually do laundry on the weekends because I am a full time uni student + I work part time so during the week is hard to make time to go to the laundromat. I told him I would do it Thursday night though, and he said ok. (Mind you he hasn\u2019t been working since he just graduated school in the fall semester so since the end of December, his parents help him pay the rent until he gets a job) \n\nAnyway Thursday rolls around and I get home from class and he\u2019s just playing a video game and he immediately asks me when I\u2019m going to do laundry since he\u2019s very nervous and wants it to go perfectly. I\u2019m so tired from school bc I had an exam he didn\u2019t even ask me about, so I feel irritated and say I\u2019m going to do it later but I\u2019m going to nap first, he again says ok and he\u2019s going to meet up with a friend for a drink to help calm his nerves.\n\nAnyway as the title says, I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off. He was super pissed, ended up wearing something else and saying that I screwed him up by not fufilling what I agreed to. I thought this might blow over since he said it still went well despite me \u201cattempting to sabatoge him\u201d but he is not speaking to him still and has even said he may go stay with his parents over this. Was I really that much of an ass?", "created_utc": 1676257797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110xuih/aita_for_screwing_up_my_boyfriends_interview_by/", "score": 1767, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, let him do his own laundry going forwards since he doesn't do anything except play games.", "NTA. If he's so concerned, why didn't he wash it himself? Regardless of the normal division of labor in your relationship, it was his interview. He can be an adult and either wash it himself or go to a dry cleaner.", "Wtf.

You *did* say you were going to do it. He should have definitely just done it himself, but you should have said that to him (earlier than Thursday night). \n\nI think he's being pretty overly dramatic in the aftermath though. He's not speaking to you and said you \"attempted to sabotage him\" because he couldn't wear the specific thing he wanted to wear? Dump him and find a grown-up to date. And work on your communication skills in the meantime.", "ESH- He definitely should be helping out more, especially since he wasn't working since he graduated and apparently had enough time to play video games. And of course, his attitude towards you.\n\nYou're also the AH, because you did tell him twice that you would do the laundry. He was relying on you and you let him down.

He knew it needed doing, it was important to him, he was sitting around wasting time that day, so he should have washed it!

Hell no", "NTA\n\nWhile you probably shouldn\u2019t have said you would do it I\u2019m still going with NTA because he is a grown man. It\u2019s sounds like you study full time, work part time and do all the housework including laundry. Your bf sounds lazy and entitled. Going to his mothers sounds perfect. Since she is likely the one who helped him develop this attitude. \n\nYou need to sit down and have a conversation about division of labour. Maybe look at how many hours you each have for everything and see what \u201cfree time\u201d is left for each individually.

He isn\u2019t married and OP is not a SAHW. And leaving that to the last minute or making it somebody else\u2019s responsibility is just plain lazy. He should know that OP goes to the laundromat on weekends. So he should have asked before that. And he should just have gone to the laundromat himself, as he had time to play video games and go out with friends. He knew OP had a full day. While OP may have been petty for not doing what she promised to do (this being the reason for the ESH verdict), he was not being a responsible adult, and so if his interview was screwed over a jacket, he screwed himself. And he runs to mommy. Geez.", "NTA. Listen OP there is no reason why you, a full-time student with a part-time job should be doing all the cleaning and laundry when he is unemployed. Sure, he may be job hunting, but as if that is taking him the same amount of time as the work you are putting in. At the very least you should be evenly dividing your household work, whether he is working or not. He is taking advantage of you. You are not his mother, he had plenty of time to wash his blazer, and frankly if the blazer screwed up his interview it wasn\u2019t going to go well anyways. After a long day you deserve to have a nap. And him blaming you for an interview going bad is completely unreasonable. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYou study full time and work part time, and are also expected to do laundry and cleaning. He\u2019s unemployed and does nothing, and expects you to wash his blazer?

That's on you.\nHe seems like he should live at home, instead of with a GF.", "NTA he's a grown ass man.", "ESH. You knew that you were more busy when you agreed to do the laundry. He had the audacity to prod you about doing his laundry while drinking and playing video games. I would totally back you if you were to point out to him that he is not pulling his weight and to do his own laundry as well as some of yours while he's at it. Instead, you did not fulfill your promises. IMO - you seriously need to have a conversation and divvy up the household tasks more fairly.", "ESH. You promised and reneged.

You could've told him you were tired and stressed and communicated things in a better way. It was kinda petty and both of you sound immature, tbh.", "You\u2019re not his mom.

You say you're in charge of laundry, you promised you would do it. You didn't but let him believe you would even when you knew you weren't going to. You should have just told him no and washed your hands of the situation. \n\nHe could have done his own laundry when it became apparent you weren't going to.

You didn\u2019t want to do his laundry, but you said you would. Why not just tell him you didn\u2019t have time or didn\u2019t want to? Instead you lied.

And I agree with the other comments that he\u2019s an adult and should do his own laundry, especially if it\u2019s for something so important. \n\nBut generally the laundry is something you do. And you did tell him explicitly you would handle this more than once. I do think it\u2019s understandable that he felt blindsided since you\u2019d confirmed multiple times that you would get it done.", "ESH. He's a grown-ass man who should be doing his own laundry, the fact that he's neither working nor in school makes it worse. However, you should have told him to do his own shit rather than saying you'll do it and then not doing it. You both could stand to grow up a bit, and he needs to learn you're not his servant or mommy.", "YTA.  You told him you would do the laundry. If you were pissed or felt some sort of way about having to do laundry when he just sits at home, you should have used your words to communicate with him.", "No, your bf is an asshole.

Never should have agreed to it in the first place, but that's besides the point. Here's a hint, you're his girlfriend, not his mother. He's a big boy, he can do his own damn laundry since he isn't doing anything else. \n\nThat kind of entitled ask would have immediately put me off of helping him either.

It\u2019s not about the laundry in my opinion, but more so that you promised him something and then broke that promise out of pure pettiness.  You knew he had been stressed about this interview for 3 weeks, and yet you still decided to fuck with his head simply because he didn\u2019t talk about you first.\n\nI understand that he could\u2019ve done his own laundry, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you broke a promise just to be petty.", "YTA. You screwed him on purpose.  You promised him multiple times that you\u2019d have it done.   \n\n\nThat said, he really can\u2019t complain about this to anyone because he SHOULD have mastered doing his own laundry 10+ years ago.

Why did you do it ?", "NTA but with the most minor hint of ESH for the pettiness. Frankly, let him go! Do you think things (since I'm sure this incident is part of a much larger picture) are going to get better in the future, or that he won't use his new job as an excuse to keep slacking in your relationship and in the house. I can already hear the \"quit being a bi+ch about everything, I hate slaving away at work and coming home to a dirty house, no hot meal, and no sex since you keep using school and work to get out of being a worthwhile girlfriend\"\n\nIs that what you want?", "It was an honest mistake.

You should be helping each other succeed not being petty and ignorant of each other.", "ESH - he is old enough to do his laundry and you should have communicated how it made you feel that he had all this spare time but couldn\u2019t do his own laundry\u2026", "YTA based on the current terms of the relationship. You do the laundry and you agreed to wash his blazer. It doesn't sound like anything happened the day you committed to washing it that would have prevented you from doing it. Essentially, you decided you didn't want to do it because you were upset at him for what appears to be how he's been for some time. \n\nYou should have told him you think he's lazy and that you aren't doing his laundry instead of potentially screwing up his interview.", "Maybe children should not cohabitate", "yta\n\nyou said you would do it so either tell him to do it himself or do it yourself. shit like this will just breed resentment. if you want him to do more around the house then sit him down and talk to him like the grown ups you supposedly are and not pull petty shit like this.", "Say what you mean and mean what you say.

You could\u2019ve just said \u201chey I\u2019m not doing your laundry\u201d.Yeh he was playing video games and went out for a drink, but you said you were going to do it.

Not make him think you were going to.", "ESH he\u2019s a lazy piece of\u2026 but you kind of deserve the way you\u2019re treated because you let him walk all over you.

You gotta keep your promises. You let him down and he has every reason to be pissed at you. Also, instead of trying to pump him up and help him get ready for this important interview, you made it all about you. So he didn't ask about your test. Who cares? Will that test matter next year? Nope. Year after that? Nope. Would his job matter, and possibly benefit you, next year?", "ESH. I lean towards you being TA because in this situation you told him multiple times you were going to do it and then didn\u2019t, but it sounds like pretty blatant misogyny on his part, so I can\u2019t quite give him a pass", "ESH, but he\u2019s a bigger AH. He\u2019s a grown man who can do his own laundry, especially for important occasions. Seems if he had time to play video hames and meet a friend for a drink, he had time to wash his blazer or drop it off at the dry cleaner. And, now he\u2019s giving you the silent treatment. \n\nYou, slightly because you should have communicated to him that you couldn\u2019t get to the laundry on Thursday as usual.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask, but you should lighten your laundry load by dumping him and his laundry.", "ESH. Y\u2019all need to learn communication.", "Your both the A-hole. I think he is over reacting\u2026 but then again maybe there is a lot problems already in the relationship", "YTA\n\nYou obviously resent your boyfriend which is fine if he isn't pulling his weight but you screwed him on purpose after lying to him of course your an asshole", "YTA. He is right. You intentionally sabotaged his interview. You agreed you would make sure his blazer was washed so he could wear it to the interview, and you didn't. On purpose. I'd say that is an asshole move.", "ESH. He is wrong for telling you to do it while he clearly had the downtime to do it and you were with work and school. You suck because you should have told him that you weren\u2019t going to do it. \n\nI get it, it should be obvious and blah blah blah, but it is up to you to set boundaries for yourself. You are also doing yourself a disservice by taking on all of this and not having a serious conversation about the division of labor in the home. This passive aggressive attitude isn\u2019t helping anyone. Time for both of you to grow up.", "YTA\n\nYou said you would do it. I understand you were tired. I understand you were annoyed that he was playing video games and planning to go have drinks with a friend instead of doing his own laundry. Have an adult conversation about how these things bother you. Saying you will do something for someone and then intentionally not doing it makes you the AH. \n\nObviously this will turn into a bash your bf and other things, but it boils down to you said you would do something and then didn\u2019t.

He\u2019s been planning for it for about 3 weeks. Usually I do all the laundry and take care of our flat in terms of cleaning.\n\nOn Wednesday he told me he wanted to wear a very specific blazer and it was in the bin to be washed. I usually do laundry on the weekends because I am a full time uni student + I work part time so during the week is hard to make time to go to the laundromat. I told him I would do it Thursday night though, and he said ok. (Mind you he hasn\u2019t been working since he just graduated school in the fall semester so since the end of December, his parents help him pay the rent until he gets a job) \n\nAnyway Thursday rolls around and I get home from class and he\u2019s just playing a video game and he immediately asks me when I\u2019m going to do laundry since he\u2019s very nervous and wants it to go perfectly. I\u2019m so tired from school bc I had an exam he didn\u2019t even ask me about, so I feel irritated and say I\u2019m going to do it later but I\u2019m going to nap first, he again says ok and he\u2019s going to meet up with a friend for a drink to help calm his nerves.\n\nAnyway as the title says, I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off. He was super pissed, ended up wearing something else and saying that I screwed him up by not fufilling what I agreed to. I thought this might blow over since he said it still went well despite me \u201cattempting to sabatoge him\u201d but he is not speaking to him still and has even said he may go stay with his parents over this.

I get your frustration, you have school, work, and it sounds like you do most of the housework on top of it if he's sitting around gaming and asking you to do the laundry he could easily do himself with all this downtime he has. There's no reason he couldn't put the game down for a bit and handle it. That's still not a good reason to lie about doing a basic household task. Communicate - would it have really been that hard to just tell him you're tired, so if he needs it done by x time he should do it himself?\n\n\nYou said it was partly because you over-napped and partly because you were pissed. Had you just overslept, I'd say N T A, accidents happen, you're burnt out, and he would be overreacting for nothing. There's no way that blazer was the make-or-break deciding factor he's acting like it is. In stead, you admit you did it cause you were pissed, hence the ESH. I wouldn't go as far as to call it \"sabotage\" necessarily, maybe a lazy ineffective attempt at it, but it was still intentionally spiteful regardless of how much it actually played into the outcome. \n\n\nYou do realize that your bf (who you share a home and living expenses with) having a job so he can contribute to those expenses is something you want, right? Next time, in stead of trying to sabotage him, either do what you say you're going to do or tell him that you're not his personal laundry service and he can do it himself. Those are the non-AH options available to you. He overreacted, but it was still a reaction to what you did (or in this case didn't do). Would've never happened if you were just upfront with him about the laundry (I hope, unless he's just an asshole in general but then why even be with him?). He sucks for being an asshole back, but you kinda started it. \n\n\nApologize to each other, communicate openly going forward, and move on. If this is a one-off in an otherwise-good relationship, it's a good opportunity for some growth for both of you. You guys are in your mid-20s now, it's time for you to communicate like an adult and time for him to start doing things for himself, also like an adult. The situation is salvageable as long as nobody doubles down.

Of course he wanted to blow the interview.", "i never understood drinking as a way to calm nerves, im usually less calm when i had a drink haha, but maybe thats just me", "> Why is he going out drinking the night before his interview instead of doing his own laundry?\n\nIdk how/why people keep overlooking this bit when it's actually a very telling indicator of the kind of person the BF is.\n\nYou know what almost every rational person I know does the night before an interview? Go over their resumes/CVs, layout clothes and engage in some last minute interview prep/LinkedIn sleuthing. Going out drinking is reserved for after the fact victory laps or a cheering up session after bombing the interview.", ">7 hr. ago  \n>  \n>Asshole Enthusiast \\[5\\]\n\nI meant to give him a chance to find a different blazer or to take his blazer out for drycleaning. \n\nShe told him she would wash it for him. She could have told him she changed her mind. She could have refused to do it in the first place. She lied. She was dishonest.", "There are blazers that can beaching washed. My kids school blazer is suitable for machine washing.", "So a coat is only called blazer if it has a logo on the outside?? Where did you learn that piece of wrong information?", "Yep, doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with anxiety. He was anxious for the interview for 3 weeks but asked her about the blazer 2 days before? Yeah, no\u2026 I am someone who is anxious before interviews, you couldn\u2019t catch me dead doing what he did.", "The guy is a much bigger asshole for being a child and treating his GF like his mother. But OP shouldn't've told him she would do it and then not do it, I mean how can you argue otherwise? If she wanted him to grow up she should have just told him to do it himself.", "I don\u2019t agree that it was intentional. She fell asleep after writing an exam and woke up later than she meant to. It seems like boyfriend expected her to just be able to do it (why would he give her ONE day to do it otherwise?). It seems she agreed because laundry is HER chore (I don\u2019t think she should have but I don\u2019t think she is remotely the asshole here because of that as his actions could\u2019ve simply prevented this). OP should learn boundaries and not fold to every request of her bf, certainly, but she did tell him before she went to nap that she was too tired and he just\u2026 didn\u2019t care and went drinking anyway. I\u2019m all for E S H votes but not in this situation because the household imbalances are astronomical and it seems she agreed to do it because she was expected to as laundry is her chore. Boyfriend\u2019s reaction to the situation was wildly disproportionate, for someone who could\u2019ve washed his own blazer.", "She tried and he said you promised", "Yeah but how could you prioritize your exhaustion over his right to go out and have fun with his friends?\n\n/s\n\nOP u/frog_grlz this is a sign you are the domestic help and he sees your free labor as something that he is entitled to.\n\nSave yourself years of fighting this entitled mooch and start prepping your exit. A man like that will drive you to divorce because he's constantly moving the goalpost to make the woman do the free domestic work.\n\nThe bar is in hell", "Problem is if he thinks that she\u2019s going to do it then why would he worry. She needed to say way sooner that\u2019s she wasn\u2019t going to have time (or whatever reason she had), so that he could do it himself.", "She fell asleep after he bullied her into saying yes. She told him no and he wouldn't accept that as an anwser", "Look, you're just a step-blazer, not a real blazer. You can't expect to be treated like a real article of clothing. Sometimes mommies and daddies go off to the laundromat and meet other garments; that's just the way life is.\n\nThe good news is that in five or ten years you can move away and get yourself a proper wash and go no contact. You can ... cut the threads, so to speak.", "No. Stop it. Get some help.\n\n(I don't have access to that specific gif so hop this works).", "Oh yeah, I forgot about those.  I actually have used them.  They are great.", "Yeah, and she deserves better than this lazy dude."]}
