He\u2019s been planning for it for about 3 weeks. Usually I do all the laundry and take care of our flat in terms of cleaning.\n\nOn Wednesday he told me he wanted to wear a very specific blazer and it was in the bin to be washed. I usually do laundry on the weekends because I am a full time uni student + I work part time so during the week is hard to make time to go to the laundromat. I told him I would do it Thursday night though, and he said ok. (Mind you he hasn\u2019t been working since he just graduated school in the fall semester so since the end of December, his parents help him pay the rent until he gets a job) \n\nAnyway Thursday rolls around and I get home from class and he\u2019s just playing a video game and he immediately asks me when I\u2019m going to do laundry since he\u2019s very nervous and wants it to go perfectly. I\u2019m so tired from school bc I had an exam he didn\u2019t even ask me about, so I feel irritated and say I\u2019m going to do it later but I\u2019m going to nap first, he again says ok and he\u2019s going to meet up with a friend for a drink to help calm his nerves.\n\nAnyway as the title says, I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off. He was super pissed, ended up wearing something else and saying that I screwed him up by not fufilling what I agreed to. I thought this might blow over since he said it still went well despite me \u201cattempting to sabatoge him\u201d but he is not speaking to him still and has even said he may go stay with his parents over this. Was I really that much of an ass?", "created_utc": 1676257797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110xuih/aita_for_screwing_up_my_boyfriends_interview_by/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, let him do his own laundry going forwards since he doesn't do anything except play games.", "NTA. If he's so concerned, why didn't he wash it himself? Regardless of the normal division of labor in your relationship, it was his interview. He can be an adult and either wash it himself or go to a dry cleaner.", "Wtf.

You *did* say you were going to do it. He should have definitely just done it himself, but you should have said that to him (earlier than Thursday night). \n\nI think he's being pretty overly dramatic in the aftermath though.

And work on your communication skills in the meantime.", "ESH- He definitely should be helping out more, especially since he wasn't working since he graduated and apparently had enough time to play video games. And of course, his attitude towards you.\n\nYou're also the AH, because you did tell him twice that you would do the laundry. He was relying on you and you let him down.

He knew it needed doing, it was important to him, he was sitting around wasting time that day, so he should have washed it!

Hell no", "NTA\n\nWhile you probably shouldn\u2019t have said you would do it I\u2019m still going with NTA because he is a grown man. It\u2019s sounds like you study full time, work part time and do all the housework including laundry. Your bf sounds lazy and entitled. Going to his mothers sounds perfect. Since she is likely the one who helped him develop this attitude. \n\nYou need to sit down and have a conversation about division of labour. Maybe look at how many hours you each have for everything and see what \u201cfree time\u201d is left for each individually.

He isn\u2019t married and OP is not a SAHW. And leaving that to the last minute or making it somebody else\u2019s responsibility is just plain lazy. He should know that OP goes to the laundromat on weekends. So he should have asked before that. And he should just have gone to the laundromat himself, as he had time to play video games and go out with friends. He knew OP had a full day. While OP may have been petty for not doing what she promised to do (this being the reason for the ESH verdict), he was not being a responsible adult, and so if his interview was screwed over a jacket, he screwed himself. And he runs to mommy. Geez.", "NTA. Listen OP there is no reason why you, a full-time student with a part-time job should be doing all the cleaning and laundry when he is unemployed. Sure, he may be job hunting, but as if that is taking him the same amount of time as the work you are putting in. At the very least you should be evenly dividing your household work, whether he is working or not. He is taking advantage of you. You are not his mother, he had plenty of time to wash his blazer, and frankly if the blazer screwed up his interview it wasn\u2019t going to go well anyways. After a long day you deserve to have a nap. And him blaming you for an interview going bad is completely unreasonable. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYou study full time and work part time, and are also expected to do laundry and cleaning. He\u2019s unemployed and does nothing, and expects you to wash his blazer?

That's on you.\nHe seems like he should live at home, instead of with a GF.", "NTA he's a grown ass man.", "ESH. You knew that you were more busy when you agreed to do the laundry. He had the audacity to prod you about doing his laundry while drinking and playing video games. I would totally back you if you were to point out to him that he is not pulling his weight and to do his own laundry as well as some of yours while he's at it. Instead, you did not fulfill your promises. IMO - you seriously need to have a conversation and divvy up the household tasks more fairly.", "ESH. You promised and reneged.

You could've told him you were tired and stressed and communicated things in a better way. It was kinda petty and both of you sound immature, tbh.", "You\u2019re not his mom.

You say you're in charge of laundry, you promised you would do it. You didn't but let him believe you would even when you knew you weren't going to. You should have just told him no and washed your hands of the situation. \n\nHe could have done his own laundry when it became apparent you weren't going to.

You didn\u2019t want to do his laundry, but you said you would. Why not just tell him you didn\u2019t have time or didn\u2019t want to? Instead you lied.

And I agree with the other comments that he\u2019s an adult and should do his own laundry, especially if it\u2019s for something so important. \n\nBut generally the laundry is something you do.

I do think it\u2019s understandable that he felt blindsided since you\u2019d confirmed multiple times that you would get it done.", "ESH. He's a grown-ass man who should be doing his own laundry, the fact that he's neither working nor in school makes it worse. However, you should have told him to do his own shit rather than saying you'll do it and then not doing it.

It\u2019s not about the laundry in my opinion, but more so that you promised him something and then broke that promise out of pure pettiness.  You knew he had been stressed about this interview for 3 weeks, and yet you still decided to fuck with his head simply because he didn\u2019t talk about you first.\n\nI understand that he could\u2019ve done his own laundry, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you broke a promise just to be petty.", "YTA. You screwed him on purpose.  You promised him multiple times that you\u2019d have it done.   \n\n\nThat said, he really can\u2019t complain about this to anyone because he SHOULD have mastered doing his own laundry 10+ years ago.

Why did you do it ?", "NTA but with the most minor hint of ESH for the pettiness. Frankly, let him go! Do you think things (since I'm sure this incident is part of a much larger picture) are going to get better in the future, or that he won't use his new job as an excuse to keep slacking in your relationship and in the house.

You do the laundry and you agreed to wash his blazer. It doesn't sound like anything happened the day you committed to washing it that would have prevented you from doing it.

Not make him think you were going to.", "ESH he\u2019s a lazy piece of\u2026 but you kind of deserve the way you\u2019re treated because you let him walk all over you.

That's not okay, but it's not very unique, it can be dealt with. It's not great, he's not a winner, but let's now look at you.\n\nYou are a liar, you lied to him multiple times about doing the laundry instead of just speaking your mind. And that's your issue, you lie to cover up your upset, then you sort of become a mental patient by sabotaging someone because you were unable to express yourself.\n\nIf I told you about your own behavior, wouldn't you think that person is a little fucked up and needs help? That they tell their partner something and then just don't do it on an important event for them.\n\nAnd he's not great, I get you're frustrated. But this behavior... It's X Files. It's out there.", "YTA. You gotta keep your promises. You let him down and he has every reason to be pissed at you. Also, instead of trying to pump him up and help him get ready for this important interview, you made it all about you. So he didn't ask about your test. Who cares? Will that test matter next year? Nope. Year after that? Nope. Would his job matter, and possibly benefit you, next year?", "ESH. I lean towards you being TA because in this situation you told him multiple times you were going to do it and then didn\u2019t, but it sounds like pretty blatant misogyny on his part, so I can\u2019t quite give him a pass", "ESH, but he\u2019s a bigger AH. He\u2019s a grown man who can do his own laundry, especially for important occasions. Seems if he had time to play video hames and meet a friend for a drink, he had time to wash his blazer or drop it off at the dry cleaner.

He is right. You intentionally sabotaged his interview. You agreed you would make sure his blazer was washed so he could wear it to the interview, and you didn't. On purpose. I'd say that is an asshole move.", "ESH. He is wrong for telling you to do it while he clearly had the downtime to do it and you were with work and school.

He\u2019s been planning for it for about 3 weeks. Usually I do all the laundry and take care of our flat in terms of cleaning.\n\nOn Wednesday he told me he wanted to wear a very specific blazer and it was in the bin to be washed. I usually do laundry on the weekends because I am a full time uni student + I work part time so during the week is hard to make time to go to the laundromat. I told him I would do it Thursday night though, and he said ok. (Mind you he hasn\u2019t been working since he just graduated school in the fall semester so since the end of December, his parents help him pay the rent until he gets a job) \n\nAnyway Thursday rolls around and I get home from class and he\u2019s just playing a video game and he immediately asks me when I\u2019m going to do laundry since he\u2019s very nervous and wants it to go perfectly. I\u2019m so tired from school bc I had an exam he didn\u2019t even ask me about, so I feel irritated and say I\u2019m going to do it later but I\u2019m going to nap first, he again says ok and he\u2019s going to meet up with a friend for a drink to help calm his nerves.\n\nAnyway as the title says, I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off. He was super pissed, ended up wearing something else and saying that I screwed him up by not fufilling what I agreed to. I thought this might blow over since he said it still went well despite me \u201cattempting to sabatoge him\u201d but he is not speaking to him still and has even said he may go stay with his parents over this.

Also, more that a little bit of an overreaction to say that the blazer is what screwed up his interview.

He was counting on you doing it and you let him down. You could've just told him to do it himself if you weren't going to. I get your frustration, you have school, work, and it sounds like you do most of the housework on top of it if he's sitting around gaming and asking you to do the laundry he could easily do himself with all this downtime he has. There's no reason he couldn't put the game down for a bit and handle it. That's still not a good reason to lie about doing a basic household task. Communicate - would it have really been that hard to just tell him you're tired, so if he needs it done by x time he should do it himself?\n\n\nYou said it was partly because you over-napped and partly because you were pissed. Had you just overslept, I'd say N T A, accidents happen, you're burnt out, and he would be overreacting for nothing. There's no way that blazer was the make-or-break deciding factor he's acting like it is. In stead, you admit you did it cause you were pissed, hence the ESH. I wouldn't go as far as to call it \"sabotage\" necessarily, maybe a lazy ineffective attempt at it, but it was still intentionally spiteful regardless of how much it actually played into the outcome. \n\n\nYou do realize that your bf (who you share a home and living expenses with) having a job so he can contribute to those expenses is something you want, right? Next time, in stead of trying to sabotage him, either do what you say you're going to do or tell him that you're not his personal laundry service and he can do it himself. Those are the non-AH options available to you. He overreacted, but it was still a reaction to what you did (or in this case didn't do). Would've never happened if you were just upfront with him about the laundry (I hope, unless he's just an asshole in general but then why even be with him?). He sucks for being an asshole back, but you kinda started it. \n\n\nApologize to each other, communicate openly going forward, and move on. If this is a one-off in an otherwise-good relationship, it's a good opportunity for some growth for both of you. You guys are in your mid-20s now, it's time for you to communicate like an adult and time for him to start doing things for himself, also like an adult. The situation is salvageable as long as nobody doubles down.

And he puts the blame on you, so that if the interview doesn't work out and he stays unemployed, he won't look like a lazy bum. Because, in his mind, \"you ruin his interviews\", so it's not his fault that he's a freeloading lazy ass, is it...", "> by watching YouTube videos\n\nYeah those aren't for an interview lol.\n\nThis dude is a hobosexual but if you say you'll do something, you need to either do it, or communicate you are unable to. You'll be better off without him but take that lesson forward into your next, hopefully more successful relationship.", "Ummm yeah NTA but you\u2019ve definitely enabled him. How hard would it be for him to spend an hour in the morning for chores/errands and then \u201crelax\u201d or \u201cnetwork\u201d (huge eyeroll) all day? \n\nThis would be a huge turn off for me. He\u2019s basically treating you like his mum.", "You really want to be with a loser like this guy?", "Even if he\u2019s actually doing this, it\u2019s not like he has a set schedule for watching YouTube videos. He could\u2019ve easily put one of those on pause while he did his own laundry. You on the other hand, have a set and very full schedule. Hard NTA.", "Job searching and networking can be time consuming, but it\u2019s not THAT time consuming. You\u2019re being taken advantage of Op, he was just looking for an excuse to avoid doing chores\u2026", "Three weeks \u201crelaxing\u201d because he has an interview?", "I thought the same thing", "Yes, I feel really bad for the blazer.  Other blazers get to go to the dry cleaner but not him.  He gets stuck in a washing machine and doesn't even get to go to the interview after all.  \n\nBut I'd disagree--if the interview's so important to the boyfriend, he should have taken care of every detail himself, including getting his outfit ready, --something he could have done weeks before btw!--and also not going out drinking with friends the night before.  It's not like he was super busy with work, he was just playing videogames.", "Well, the part where op is at fault is saying she would do it and then not do it. If she had just said \"I am tired, so do it yourself\", that would have been the perfect solution.", "I\u2019m also wondering if they did laundry during that 3 weeks..", "So, you're absolving a so-called adult from doing a load of laundry because an overworked, overtired gf is done with his shit?\n\nHe had three weeks to wash it his goddamned self.  Entirely on him.", "Even with a promise, it\u2019s still on him to make sure it was done. It\u2019s also one of those items that really should be dropped off at a cleaners.", "I\u2019m sorry but if you\u2019re 26 years old and you don\u2019t know how to do laundry, you\u2019re pathetic. Google is free. So is YouTube. This is ridiculous.\n\nIf you need three weeks to play video games to destress and prepare for a single interview while your partner works and goes to school and is your live in maid, good fucking luck with the stresses of work. What would this poor guy do if he didn\u2019t have his mommy girlfriend???", "He could have gotten the blazer in the wash in a regular laundry day, as part of prepping over three weeks.  That's basic planning, also an important job skill, so yes, I'd say the bf is AH.", "I wouldn't say she purposely sabotage it. but their communication is flawed.", "Put your foot down. You guys are adults...not teenagers.  Use your words.  You caved in and said you'd do it again.  That is enabling.  Say what you mean and mean what you say!", "\u201ci can\u2019t do your laundry today. i\u2019m tired. i\u2019ve had a long day. if you want it washed you\u2019re going to have to do it yourself.\u201d it\u2019s that easy", "True but that's not what this debate is about my man. She said she would do something and she didn't follow through so that makes her the a******.", "But you still gave him confirmation that you would do it- your word is your bond. There\u2019s two things going on here:\n- he bullied you into a \u201cyes\u201d you couldn\u2019t commit to\n- you had the best of intentions to do it, but you flaked and didn\u2019t set the alarm for after your nap\n\nIf he\u2019s bullying you into over extending yourself, I would take a serious look at things. Relationships aren\u2019t 50/50- they only work when each partner gives 100%. If he\u2019s expecting 150% from you and you can\u2019t keep up, I would reevaluate.", "Then that makes me wonder why are they living together in the first place", "[deleted]", "Both of you need to grow up: he needs to start taking care of himself, and you need to start setting clear boundaries and expectations when it comes to chores.", "Please be honest w yourself.", "By and large, people treat you the way you let them.", "You're lying to me now, you said it was also because you were partially pissed off. And I think that's actually more the truth.\n\nBut I don't expect you to have the skills to actually express how you feel in a meaningful way right now.", "Your SO shouldn't try to help you? I dgaf if it's a male or female. She could've done better", "Well, I am a woman and definitely not the boyfriend thanks. She made the commitment and the  chose to sabotage his interview instead. This was a temper tantrum in my opinion.", "Same, George, same.", "This right here.", "Indeed - Hope op sees this. Yikes!\n\nNTA.", "He is treating OP as his bang maid. Though to be fair, he may move back in with his mum if OP keeps slacking.\n\nSometimes, the bullet dodges you.\n\nI don't know how OP has missed all these \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 she keeps picking up around their place while he does YouTube, networking (lol wtf), and video games.\n\nOn the one hand, when looking for employment, it should be treated as your full-time job. On the other hand, those job responsibilities include making sure you're fully prepared for interviews instead of partying with friends.\n\nNTA OP, and you deserve better. He won't be any better of a partner when he does actually have a job and is not leeching off his parents... RUN.\n\nAlso, I fully recognize that OP agreed to this chore, but is this an equal relationship? Would he ever agree to do her laundry once exams roll around, or would video games, networking, and drinking with the boys take precedence?\n\nEdit: revising my NTA to a soft ESH, but he's a way bigger asshole than OP. I'm not sure why OP agreed to slave away for him while in uni and working, and he gets to relax while OP caters to his every need...", "[deleted]", "Yeah that's not something I get. All of my suits and blazers always go to the dry cleaner. These two sound young and immature.", "You wouldn't, but she said it. \n\n>I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off.\n\nIt's even in the title.", "It\u2019s both of those situations", "Based on what OP said, he was playing games and drinking with buddies, and not at any point in three weeks could take a few hours to do a load of laundry.\n\nOp is in school and apparently takes care of the majority of the household work to the point that she passed out, and she feels badly about it.\n\nIf he'd done anything of value, I'm sure that Op wouldn't have even asked and instead would have just self-flagellated.", "Op literally said he is not working", "Yes I was partially pissed off because I felt irritated that he was whining about me doing it and he didn\u2019t even ask me about my day and went out instead of offering to help so yes it was both because I probably could\u2019ve gone or set an alarm", "No.  He, at no point, took responsibility for his actions and incompetence.  It is entirely and completely his fault.  She shouldn't have to say \"fuck it,\" because an adult who had three goddamned weeks to do something as simple as running a load of laundry should have done it his own damn self.", "I wouldn\u2019t waste money dry-cleaning an H&M blazer", "ok that fair.", "Sounds like he wouldn't have accepted a \"no\", he'd have kept on with the whinging and the saying you'd already promised.... sounds like natural consequences to me. Man can grow up and sort his own basic BASIC needs he just doesn't want to and thinks you should be picking up his slack. If he can weaponise his incompetence you can too, and napping through the last night possible to do his blazer seems like a good way to go to me. Dude saw for 3 weeks you weren't getting around to HIS PERSONAL CHORES yet didn't step up and handle his business.....", "OP goes to school and works part time. I doubt they are living off of a part time income", "I seen. I made an edit. I went with ESH but he sucks more", "No. You should have done something so long ago.\n\nThe best you can do no is explain how you feel overworked. Not by this good will I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it and then not, because you have no good will, because no one is expressing how they really feel.\n\nWhich is like why are you even in the relationship without that basic ability.", "Listen, you may have been a bit passive aggressive here and you do need to learn how to set boundaries and say no, but you need to be with someone who isn\u2019t going to dump all his chores on you. You are working and going to school and doing all the cleaning and chores and he does NOTHING. Seriously get out of this relationship. His selfishness and entitlement and straight up laziness are massive red flags.", "His incompetence doesn't excuse her actions. Her actions are fully her own, and she needs to own up to them. Stop making excuses for her by pointing to someone else.", "Yeah, I saw that edit. I don't shop at H&M, but can assume their clothes are on the cheap side.", "Well, then that makes it even worse, doesn't it?", "Hey nice. That was my exact verdict too", "You\u2019re speaking to her like she lied about killing the family cat lmfao??? So harsh.", "That someone else being a 26 year old who's unemployed and living on his girlfriend's labor?  Tell me you're a misogynist without saying it.", "That could mean that he is working as well. We don\u2019t know what he is doing. If OP says he is doing nothing at all and puts nothing towards the household, I will change my judgement to ESH", "This entire time I thought he did stuff and was just asking for a small favor. However, he does nothing and his parents pay for his portion of bills and rent?! Nah, that's ridiculous", "Someone investigate this guy and the status of his family cats, that's too specific", "That someone being literally anyone, doing literally anything. It would be exactly the same if the genders were reversed, you are the only one bringing misogyny in here. \n\nYour actions are your own. Always. The bf's actions did not force hers, she chose to do them. There is a saying, you may have heard it: \"two wrongs don't make a right\"?\n\nNo matter how bad her boyfriend's actions are, that is not the yardstick by which we measure hers (and vice-versa, since you insist on bringing sexism into this). Her actions were petty and unnecessary, and her bf being a waste of carbon doesn't change that.", "According to OP his parents are paying his portion of the rent. He\u2019s contributing zero towards the rent or household chores.", "Woooow ok then", "Yeah, changing my judgement to ESH but he sucks more"]}
