He\u2019s been planning for it for about 3 weeks. Usually I do all the laundry and take care of our flat in terms of cleaning.\n\nOn Wednesday he told me he wanted to wear a very specific blazer and it was in the bin to be washed. I usually do laundry on the weekends because I am a full time uni student + I work part time so during the week is hard to make time to go to the laundromat. I told him I would do it Thursday night though, and he said ok. (Mind you he hasn\u2019t been working since he just graduated school in the fall semester so since the end of December, his parents help him pay the rent until he gets a job) \n\nAnyway Thursday rolls around and I get home from class and he\u2019s just playing a video game and he immediately asks me when I\u2019m going to do laundry since he\u2019s very nervous and wants it to go perfectly. I\u2019m so tired from school bc I had an exam he didn\u2019t even ask me about, so I feel irritated and say I\u2019m going to do it later but I\u2019m going to nap first, he again says ok and he\u2019s going to meet up with a friend for a drink to help calm his nerves.\n\nAnyway as the title says, I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off. He was super pissed, ended up wearing something else and saying that I screwed him up by not fufilling what I agreed to. I thought this might blow over since he said it still went well despite me \u201cattempting to sabatoge him\u201d but he is not speaking to him still and has even said he may go stay with his parents over this. Was I really that much of an ass?", "created_utc": 1676257797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110xuih/aita_for_screwing_up_my_boyfriends_interview_by/", "score": 4845, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You *did* say you were going to do it. He should have definitely just done it himself, but you should have said that to him (earlier than Thursday night). \n\nI think he's being pretty overly dramatic in the aftermath though. He's not speaking to you and said you \"attempted to sabotage him\" because he couldn't wear the specific thing he wanted to wear? Dump him and find a grown-up to date. And work on your communication skills in the meantime.", "ESH- He definitely should be helping out more, especially since he wasn't working since he graduated and apparently had enough time to play video games. And of course, his attitude towards you.\n\nYou're also the AH, because you did tell him twice that you would do the laundry. He was relying on you and you let him down. You should've either told him to wash his blazer himself or tell him that there was a chance you couldn't do it.

He knew it needed doing, it was important to him, he was sitting around wasting time that day, so he should have washed it!

Hell no", "NTA\n\nWhile you probably shouldn\u2019t have said you would do it I\u2019m still going with NTA because he is a grown man. It\u2019s sounds like you study full time, work part time and do all the housework including laundry. Your bf sounds lazy and entitled. Going to his mothers sounds perfect. Since she is likely the one who helped him develop this attitude. \n\nYou need to sit down and have a conversation about division of labour. Maybe look at how many hours you each have for everything and see what \u201cfree time\u201d is left for each individually.

He isn\u2019t married and OP is not a SAHW. And leaving that to the last minute or making it somebody else\u2019s responsibility is just plain lazy. He should know that OP goes to the laundromat on weekends. So he should have asked before that. And he should just have gone to the laundromat himself, as he had time to play video games and go out with friends. He knew OP had a full day. While OP may have been petty for not doing what she promised to do (this being the reason for the ESH verdict), he was not being a responsible adult, and so if his interview was screwed over a jacket, he screwed himself. And he runs to mommy. Geez.", "NTA. Listen OP there is no reason why you, a full-time student with a part-time job should be doing all the cleaning and laundry when he is unemployed. Sure, he may be job hunting, but as if that is taking him the same amount of time as the work you are putting in. At the very least you should be evenly dividing your household work, whether he is working or not. He is taking advantage of you. You are not his mother, he had plenty of time to wash his blazer, and frankly if the blazer screwed up his interview it wasn\u2019t going to go well anyways. After a long day you deserve to have a nap. And him blaming you for an interview going bad is completely unreasonable. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYou study full time and work part time, and are also expected to do laundry and cleaning. He\u2019s unemployed and does nothing, and expects you to wash his blazer?

That's on you.\nHe seems like he should live at home, instead of with a GF.", "NTA he's a grown ass man.", "ESH. You knew that you were more busy when you agreed to do the laundry. He had the audacity to prod you about doing his laundry while drinking and playing video games. I would totally back you if you were to point out to him that he is not pulling his weight and to do his own laundry as well as some of yours while he's at it. Instead, you did not fulfill your promises. IMO - you seriously need to have a conversation and divvy up the household tasks more fairly.", "ESH. You promised and reneged.

You could've told him you were tired and stressed and communicated things in a better way. It was kinda petty and both of you sound immature, tbh.", "You\u2019re not his mom.

You say you're in charge of laundry, you promised you would do it. You didn't but let him believe you would even when you knew you weren't going to. You should have just told him no and washed your hands of the situation. \n\nHe could have done his own laundry when it became apparent you weren't going to. You both sound immature and you both kinda suck.", "ESH, he need grow up and you need to learn to better communicate, sit down and talk to him. it be a stupid reason for him to move like this.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t want to do his laundry, but you said you would. Why not just tell him you didn\u2019t have time or didn\u2019t want to? Instead you lied.

To keep saying I'll do it, I'll do it...well, you should live up to your word.  However,  what you should have done was be honest and say I'm tired from school, babe.

You shouldn't have told him you had a lot going on instead.", "YTA You lied. You said you were going to do something and didn't.

If at any point you\u2019d told him you were busy, or he should manage that, and *then* he pushed back at all it would be different. And I agree with the other comments that he\u2019s an adult and should do his own laundry, especially if it\u2019s for something so important. \n\nBut generally the laundry is something you do. And you did tell him explicitly you would handle this more than once. I do think it\u2019s understandable that he felt blindsided since you\u2019d confirmed multiple times that you would get it done.", "ESH. He's a grown-ass man who should be doing his own laundry, the fact that he's neither working nor in school makes it worse. However, you should have told him to do his own shit rather than saying you'll do it and then not doing it. You both could stand to grow up a bit, and he needs to learn you're not his servant or mommy.", "YTA.  You told him you would do the laundry. If you were pissed or felt some sort of way about having to do laundry when he just sits at home, you should have used your words to communicate with him.", "No, your bf is an asshole. Massive red flags over something so simple and he could have done it himself. Why are you with the guy who needs a mummy not a partner?", "NTA. Never should have agreed to it in the first place, but that's besides the point. Here's a hint, you're his girlfriend, not his mother. He's a big boy, he can do his own damn laundry since he isn't doing anything else. \n\nThat kind of entitled ask would have immediately put me off of helping him either. The second someone feels entitled to the help I offer, you can do it yourself. I'm nice, not a doormat.", "YTA for telling him you would do it and not telling him that you changed your mind", "Hot take, but I\u2019m going to say YTA.  It\u2019s not about the laundry in my opinion, but more so that you promised him something and then broke that promise out of pure pettiness.  You knew he had been stressed about this interview for 3 weeks, and yet you still decided to fuck with his head simply because he didn\u2019t talk about you first.\n\nI understand that he could\u2019ve done his own laundry, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you broke a promise just to be petty.", "YTA. You screwed him on purpose.  You promised him multiple times that you\u2019d have it done.   \n\n\nThat said, he really can\u2019t complain about this to anyone because he SHOULD have mastered doing his own laundry 10+ years ago. If he tells the story of how he was playing video games then went out to a pub while he couldn\u2019t figure out how to work a washing machine, he looks like a chump.   \n\n\nBut the two of you know, you let him down here. Why did you do it ?", "NTA but with the most minor hint of ESH for the pettiness. Frankly, let him go! Do you think things (since I'm sure this incident is part of a much larger picture) are going to get better in the future, or that he won't use his new job as an excuse to keep slacking in your relationship and in the house. I can already hear the \"quit being a bi+ch about everything, I hate slaving away at work and coming home to a dirty house, no hot meal, and no sex since you keep using school and work to get out of being a worthwhile girlfriend\"\n\nIs that what you want?", "It was an honest mistake.

You should be helping each other succeed not being petty and ignorant of each other.", "ESH - he is old enough to do his laundry and you should have communicated how it made you feel that he had all this spare time but couldn\u2019t do his own laundry\u2026", "YTA based on the current terms of the relationship. You do the laundry and you agreed to wash his blazer. It doesn't sound like anything happened the day you committed to washing it that would have prevented you from doing it. Essentially, you decided you didn't want to do it because you were upset at him for what appears to be how he's been for some time. \n\nYou should have told him you think he's lazy and that you aren't doing his laundry instead of potentially screwing up his interview.", "Maybe children should not cohabitate", "yta\n\nyou said you would do it so either tell him to do it himself or do it yourself. shit like this will just breed resentment. if you want him to do more around the house then sit him down and talk to him like the grown ups you supposedly are and not pull petty shit like this.", "Say what you mean and mean what you say. He's been a slob since December and you took it so it's nothing new. YTA.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve just said \u201chey I\u2019m not doing your laundry\u201d.Yeh he was playing video games and went out for a drink, but you said you were going to do it. It would\u2019ve been easy to say no sorry you will have to do it. Not make him think you were going to.", "ESH he\u2019s a lazy piece of\u2026 but you kind of deserve the way you\u2019re treated because you let him walk all over you. The situation is not going to improve, if you want to be his bangmaid for the rest of your life go ahead, but you don\u2019t need to cry to Reddit about it.", "[removed]", "YTA. You gotta keep your promises. You let him down and he has every reason to be pissed at you. Also, instead of trying to pump him up and help him get ready for this important interview, you made it all about you. So he didn't ask about your test. Who cares? Will that test matter next year? Nope. Year after that? Nope. Would his job matter, and possibly benefit you, next year?", "ESH. I lean towards you being TA because in this situation you told him multiple times you were going to do it and then didn\u2019t, but it sounds like pretty blatant misogyny on his part, so I can\u2019t quite give him a pass", "ESH, but he\u2019s a bigger AH. He\u2019s a grown man who can do his own laundry, especially for important occasions. Seems if he had time to play video hames and meet a friend for a drink, he had time to wash his blazer or drop it off at the dry cleaner. And, now he\u2019s giving you the silent treatment. \n\nYou, slightly because you should have communicated to him that you couldn\u2019t get to the laundry on Thursday as usual.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask, but you should lighten your laundry load by dumping him and his laundry.", "ESH. Y\u2019all need to learn communication.", "Your both the A-hole. I think he is over reacting\u2026 but then again maybe there is a lot problems already in the relationship", "YTA\n\nYou obviously resent your boyfriend which is fine if he isn't pulling his weight but you screwed him on purpose after lying to him of course your an asshole", "YTA. He is right. You intentionally sabotaged his interview. You agreed you would make sure his blazer was washed so he could wear it to the interview, and you didn't. On purpose. I'd say that is an asshole move.", "ESH. He is wrong for telling you to do it while he clearly had the downtime to do it and you were with work and school. You suck because you should have told him that you weren\u2019t going to do it. \n\nI get it, it should be obvious and blah blah blah, but it is up to you to set boundaries for yourself. You are also doing yourself a disservice by taking on all of this and not having a serious conversation about the division of labor in the home. This passive aggressive attitude isn\u2019t helping anyone. Time for both of you to grow up.", "YTA\n\nYou said you would do it. I understand you were tired. I understand you were annoyed that he was playing video games and planning to go have drinks with a friend instead of doing his own laundry. Have an adult conversation about how these things bother you. Saying you will do something for someone and then intentionally not doing it makes you the AH. \n\nObviously this will turn into a bash your bf and other things, but it boils down to you said you would do something and then didn\u2019t. If you want things to change you need to have the conversation with him or break up. If it was that important he absolutely should have done it himself. I do understand he asked and you agreed. He asked again and you confirmed you would after your nap. If you weren\u2019t going to do it and didn\u2019t want to do it, just be honest and tell him that.", "YTA. You said you would do something and then didn't, with real world consequences. Why? Because you had a feeling. Be an adult and communicate with your partner before you let your feelings get the better of you to hurt your partner. You jealous he actually got an interview and you're still in school?", "YTA. Learn to communicate better.", "YTA. Yes, he is a grown man and capable of doing it himself but you said you were gonna do it and you broke his trust.

He\u2019s been planning for it for about 3 weeks. Usually I do all the laundry and take care of our flat in terms of cleaning.\n\nOn Wednesday he told me he wanted to wear a very specific blazer and it was in the bin to be washed. I usually do laundry on the weekends because I am a full time uni student + I work part time so during the week is hard to make time to go to the laundromat. I told him I would do it Thursday night though, and he said ok. (Mind you he hasn\u2019t been working since he just graduated school in the fall semester so since the end of December, his parents help him pay the rent until he gets a job) \n\nAnyway Thursday rolls around and I get home from class and he\u2019s just playing a video game and he immediately asks me when I\u2019m going to do laundry since he\u2019s very nervous and wants it to go perfectly. I\u2019m so tired from school bc I had an exam he didn\u2019t even ask me about, so I feel irritated and say I\u2019m going to do it later but I\u2019m going to nap first, he again says ok and he\u2019s going to meet up with a friend for a drink to help calm his nerves.\n\nAnyway as the title says, I ended up not doing the laundry because I was tired and also partially pissed off. He was super pissed, ended up wearing something else and saying that I screwed him up by not fufilling what I agreed to. I thought this might blow over since he said it still went well despite me \u201cattempting to sabatoge him\u201d but he is not speaking to him still and has even said he may go stay with his parents over this.

Also, more that a little bit of an overreaction to say that the blazer is what screwed up his interview.

I get your frustration, you have school, work, and it sounds like you do most of the housework on top of it if he's sitting around gaming and asking you to do the laundry he could easily do himself with all this downtime he has. There's no reason he couldn't put the game down for a bit and handle it. That's still not a good reason to lie about doing a basic household task. Communicate - would it have really been that hard to just tell him you're tired, so if he needs it done by x time he should do it himself?\n\n\nYou said it was partly because you over-napped and partly because you were pissed. Had you just overslept, I'd say N T A, accidents happen, you're burnt out, and he would be overreacting for nothing. There's no way that blazer was the make-or-break deciding factor he's acting like it is. In stead, you admit you did it cause you were pissed, hence the ESH. I wouldn't go as far as to call it \"sabotage\" necessarily, maybe a lazy ineffective attempt at it, but it was still intentionally spiteful regardless of how much it actually played into the outcome. \n\n\nYou do realize that your bf (who you share a home and living expenses with) having a job so he can contribute to those expenses is something you want, right? Next time, in stead of trying to sabotage him, either do what you say you're going to do or tell him that you're not his personal laundry service and he can do it himself. Those are the non-AH options available to you. He overreacted, but it was still a reaction to what you did (or in this case didn't do). Would've never happened if you were just upfront with him about the laundry (I hope, unless he's just an asshole in general but then why even be with him?). He sucks for being an asshole back, but you kinda started it. \n\n\nApologize to each other, communicate openly going forward, and move on. If this is a one-off in an otherwise-good relationship, it's a good opportunity for some growth for both of you. You guys are in your mid-20s now, it's time for you to communicate like an adult and time for him to start doing things for himself, also like an adult. The situation is salvageable as long as nobody doubles down.

Absolute first and foremost... the blazer was not the key to your bf getting the job. I've hired a lot of people in my day. I'm taking in the skillset, experience, problem-solving approach, interpersonal skills, attitude, work ethic, character and demonstrated interest of the person. I'm not focused on their clothing too much. Guess what? I can't speak to his skillset or experience. but it's clear from this post that bf lacks in every other area. There's no way I would have hired him if he had come in with a custom-made Saville Row suit on him.\n\nBF is just using you as a scapegoat for his failure. Not a quality I would accept in my significant other. (Frankly, all those other qualities listed above that your bf lacks also make him a really poor bf.)\n\nIf BF really believes that the blazer was the key to his success, then he really should have placed a higher priority on making sure he had this amazing, magical blazer in tiptop shape for his interview. Instead...\n\n1. BF had all the time in the world to take care of the laundry - not just Wed. night, not just Thursday night, but also Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday day, and Thursday day. He didn't have the incredibly important (/s) commitment of 'plans with the boys' all of that time.\n2. You may be the one who does LAUNDRY ON THE WEEKENDS. That doesn't mean you are obligated to forever and always do laundry on demand. This was on off-routine need. For him. He should have done it. Or he could have planned not to wear/throw the blazer in the wash on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday.\n3. BTW, since bf has more than enough time but no money to pay his share of expenses, he should have already picked up more of those home chores (like taking care of laundry during the week so that you don't have to do it after a long week of work)!!!\n4. So he pesters you into saying you will do after a long day of work. You come home and make clear that you are exhausted. Your exhaustion and his great need for his magical blazer are not more important to him than his sacred commitment to drink and play with his buddies (what all successful candidates choose to do the night before an all-important job interview! - /s). I don't say you are an ahole for having agreed to what bf pestered you into doing. I say you are weak in standing up for yourself. You are allowing a user of a guy to steamroll over you. You are being an ahole to yourself. I hope you take steps to stop doing that really soon!\n5. You've defended your bf that he had been actively looking for a job before. That's fine. The poor qualities and character he is showing were still probably present long before he lost his former job. (Not sure if the reason he lost his former job was due to some of these poor qualities of his.) It's slightly possible that he just became this massive jerk in the past week or two and will soon recover his former good partner habits of (1) taking care of his own needs, (2) prioritizing his future over carousing, (3) pulling his fair share of the weight of work/finances you two have as a couple, (4) caring about your needs and need for a break as much as his own, (5) not making up bs excuses and blame-shifting onto you.

However if he\u2019s not in school or working it\u2019s absurd that she is doing this much! OP next time just say no. He needs to get himself ready for interviews and getting your clothing ready is part of that prep. It really shouldn\u2019t have even been your job, but since you agreed to do, you need to do it!", "If he doesn't even do his own laundry, you think he knows how to use an iron?", "Seriously! This guy is a clot. Sits around playing video games, parents pay for his existence, goes out drinking with the boys ,but yet it's your fault his blazer didn't get washed . You also do the cleaning. This dude is treating you like his mommy. He couldn't even be bothered to ask you about your day. Wait until you have your bio children, then you can parent. You don't need that now. He is showing you exactly who he is. NTA", "All true. Whether or not this relationship survives, OP needs to learn to say what she means. It\u2019s a life skill she\u2019ll need in any relationship. It\u2019s ineffective and unfair to make people guess what she wants.\n\n\u201cSorry, no, I don\u2019t have time to wash your blazer this week. You\u2019ll need to do it this time. To be honest, I\u2019m getting irritated that I\u2019m doing more than my share around here. We need to talk about that later. Good luck with your interview though!\u201d", "Agree, I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable asking someone juggling school and work to do something when I'm completely free. Sounds like he's used to having mommy and daddy pick up after him, and hoping OP will pick up the slack. She also shouldn't have agreed though. ESH", "Also the dude needs to start contributing to cleaning and cooking. Should have done this while in school and continue to do this the rest of his life because he\u2019s not an infant anymore.", "Well my ex husband fell into that category.\nHe would always iron his Marine uniforms since I couldn't iron for shit.\nAs for doing his own laundry I am sure he did know how but that bit always fell in my lap.", "I feel personally attacked \ud83e\udee0", "Depends on what your definition of cleaning is.  I scoop my cats litter out daily; I clean weekly.  Cleaning for me is emptying out the litter into the trash; scrubbing out the pan; wiping out her enclosure; changing the charcoal odor absorption packets inside there; vacuuming the enclosure; and putting new litter in her pan.   Id die (and be broke from buying litter) if I did that daily.", "No, of course not. Husband did the box and now I have to do it today, without the benefit of rock paper scissors", "Can concur. My 17 yr old son does his own laundry and even vacuums his own room.", "Omg totally! He definitely needs to step up in a lot of ways! I can absolutely see why OP was so frustrated. Like she\u2019s over here busting her butt and his parents are paying his rent while he just hangs out\u2026 yeah not cool.", "Yes, correct"]}
