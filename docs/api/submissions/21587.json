That is a massive AH move on your part.", "I\u2019m mortified for you", "They are your children. \n\nThey are your responsibility regardless of geography.", "As a parent myself, that\u2019s not how that works AT ALL. \n\nYou are more than welcome to ask if they\u2019re ok with watching the kids while you\u2019re visiting but if your family says no, that\u2019s that. \n\nYou\u2019re the parent. You\u2019re in charge of watching your children. You signed up to watch them all the time because they\u2019re YOUR kids. Not anybody else\u2019s. Even when you\u2019re visiting family. \n\nI understand wanting some alone time with your spouse, I really do. But it\u2019s so entitled to think your family NEEDS to watch them whenever you visit.", "Then don't bring them, if you don't care if your kids see their relatives. They can come visit you if they want to see them. Why do you act like somebody forced you with violance to drive there?", "I guess if it's that much of an issue you can invite your family to visit you? \n\nThat still wouldn't entitle you to free babysitting, though.", "If that's been your situation three times now then I don't know what to say\n\nbut most people with children made a conscious effort to conceive, adopt or otherwise become parents", "This isn\u2019t the Immaculate Conception. You not only chose to have 1 child, you chose to have 3. There are no victims here, only volunteers.\n\nEdit: I would argue your poor relatives are victims of your blatant entitlement.", "So some sperm just \"accidentally\" fell down into your fallopian tubes, you carried and delivered a 7-10 lb human and didn't know the whole time????!\n\nOF COURSE you chose to have those kids.", "So you have kids you don\u2019t want? You all have much bigger problems.", "yikes, get help.", "Wtf how ignorant", "You don\u2019t want your kids?????", "There are other options if you don't want kids.", "Please get your ability to procreate any further removed.", "So you accidentally fell onto a dick.

Is that why you're forcing them on other people?", "You chose to be creampied\n\nNo one owes you shit.", "Maybe the first time but you have 3 kids. There was definitely some decision-making involved, lol", "Ahhhh most people do? Do you think kids only born because of a broken condom, and not because a loving couple decide they are ready for a kid?\nAre you aware that some people pay thousands of dollars just so they can have a kid? \n\nWhat are you talking about", "You need to talk to your doctor about birth control options.  With kids already they will probably approve permanent options.", "Ok going with this analogy. Usually after for first \u201ccar accident \u201c you drive with more caution.

Omg.", "Hahahah wtf?   I chose to have kids.", "What!? If you choose to have sex without taking precautions you 1000% choose to have kids.  I mean that\u2019s how it works.", "After 3 kids you can't figure out how babies are made? Lol", "Last time I checked condoms exist and other protections against having kids... Its a choice to NOT wear them.\n\nHow are you this blind to the consequences of your actions?", "Nope. You seem not to understand how human reproduction works.", "The biggest yikes I\u2019ve read in a while.

Who was at fault for you having kids?", "Do you know how babies are made?", "LOL, you have to be joking. This is probably one of the MOST idiotic statements I've seen. THAT'S HILARIOUS. Fucking comparing death and tragic accidents TO FORGETTING TO PULL OUT LOLLLLL. Using protection easily prevents 97+% pregnancies.

There is a connection between those? Dammit why didn\u2019t someone tell me I shouldn\u2019t sleep in sex ed?\u201c \nOP probably"]}
