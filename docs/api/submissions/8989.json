I\u2019m 23 years old & I work in a warehouse. I had my first child at 18 and then my second at 21. I know for a fact I have made some risky choices in my past but I could never regret my daughters. Due to having two daughters early and not really having a career or a high paying job I haven\u2019t been very stable financially but I\u2019ve been getting by due to Memphis TN having a lower cost of living. I get around 35 hours at my warehouse job and I make 22 an hour. I could get a few more hours at my job but usually can\u2019t because I have my youngest daughter until her mother gets off work. I usually try to work every Sunday for overtime to get by. The mother of my oldest daughter is where the problem arises. I\u2019ve been sending the mother of my oldest daughter (my youngest daughter\u2019s mother too) 100$ dollars a week out of every check regardless of what bill I have to pay or whether that 100$ would be my last since our daughter was born. I\u2019ve ran up my credit cards just to make those payments sometimes and I\u2019ve never missed a payment . The mother of my oldest daughter even told me she needed me to send even more than 100$ a week and when I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it because I support another child as well and I also have rent, car insurance, car note etc. The mother of my oldest child didn\u2019t like this so she filed child support. After the child support court case  the judge ordered I only had to pay her 89$ a week because I had so much credit from already sending her 100$ a week for 4 years straight. Now she\u2019s trying to make it seem like I\u2019m a deadbeat and recently put my oldest daughter in a daycare that costs 250$ a week without discussing it with me and is expecting me to pay the whole thing. AITA or am I just overthinking? I would have no problem supporting my oldest child as I\u2019ve been doing my best to do but she thinks I\u2019m just a walking bank or something. If I were to do all these things she wanted me to do I wouldn\u2019t have any money left to even take care of myself.\n\n\nUpdate* I think some of you are looking over the fact I have to support my youngest daughter as well I send her mother 100$ a week as well and I get both my daughters every Friday through Sunday.  I\u2019m also currently in college to help seek a better paying job so I won\u2019t be working in this warehouse for long", "created_utc": 1675390522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s892u/aita_for_not_sending_my_childs_mother_extra_money/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what the laws in TN are, but in some places, sending extra $$ for a regular service can be used as evidence that you can afford to pay *more* than the original order. \n\n\nThat said I want to make sure you understand, because most people don't, what that child support you're sending is supposed to do. \n\nThe way it works is the court says, okay, Dad makes $X and mom makes $Y and if they were living together child would have a standard of living which is $X and $Y for a 3 person household. But now the kid is living in a single parent household and without making anyone immediately homeless we have to make sure the child can still live at that standard. Or... as close as possible. \n\nSo they made up some figures that are supposed to recognize that, and apply those percentages to your $X and decide your payment. And that's supposed to go to the mom to offset your contribution to the kid's standard of living. So it's so mom can afford to pay the (the child's portion of) rent and utilities and diapers or whatever goes into *regular* household expenses. \n\nAll *greatly* oversimplified, but...\n\nThey don't factor in medical emergencies, or natural disasters, or any of the millions of random things that could come up. \n\nIf these things do come up, it's unlikely mom will be able to afford it alone. And this is still your child, so it would be fair and reasonable to pay whatever portion needs to be paid to yknow... make sure your child has their needs met.\n\nI'm sure you already knew that, but some people don't, so it bears saying.\n\nSidenote: $250/week for daycare isn't much. The national average cost in 2021 was $226/week for a toddler, and $261/week for after school care. \n\nSome places are higher, and some lower, but it's only gotten more expensive since then. I know it seems like an insane amount of money, but... that's likely not some \"expensive\" day care, just... day care. Kid has to be somewhere while mom's at work, right?\n\nAnyway, still totally NTA, but some things to consider. \n\nBest of luck to you and both your children!", "You were giving her $100 a week for four years BEFORE the courts stepped in and said, \u201c$89\u201d.

Plus, there may be places that do a sliding scale based on income if she's struggling that bad with daycare fees. Could be worth looking into.", "NTA, you're doing all you can. Make sure you keep looking at new employment opportunities and take them when they'll get you higher pay and better working environment!", "NTA\n\nYou where sending $100 a week which is what you could barley afford.\nShe wanted more that you couldn't afford so she went the legal route to try and make you pay more.

The way the courts look at it, whichever parent has the child more should provide more. Not saying it's fair, but it is logical and just. If the court determined $89 was his portion for the time she isn't with him, then he was already doing more than necessary. The daycare thing is just plain spite.

Divide in half for each parent = 19.18 per day per parent. 19.18*4 = 76.72. That would theoretically be his half of the expenses for the time she is with her mother. (Feel free to check my math, I did it twice but might have missed something)\n\nAlso if you're gonna argue about splitting costs- why is he responsible for providing for his child while she is not with him, but the mother is not expected to do the same? If she is the primary caregiver, she is also eligible for assistance, while he would not be. So while he is paying out of pocket for all expenses, she could qualify for SNAP, possibly medicaid, TANF, etc. When I had WIC (kids under 5) and SNAP, and took advantage of the Double Up Bucks program, I was able to feed myself and my kid for about $100 PER MONTH (Bulk section is your friend) She definitely sounds like this is pettiness, and maybe poor financial management, not true costs. \n\nHe is and has been paying more than his fair share.", "Some of you ppl crack me up- my kids father pays me $150 a month and that\u2019s for 2 kids!

That information would be laid out in the current support order issued on file.\n\nI can say that this is something that judges in the family court system see often enough that if it's obvious she's being spiteful and punishing him for the court order, this is going to piss their judge off! What Op should be doing is building a FU binder with all their records, proof of past and current payments, a past and current calendar of when they had their shared child in his custody, print outs of all her text/emails. Evidence of hostility. Call recording if legal in their state. And a complete list of child care facilities, the cost and median average.\n\nThe ex will need to provide a reason for the sudden need and use of child care.

Is clearly laid out, has right of first refusal if Op feels that's in the best interest of their shared child. Is clear on pick-up, drop-off locations and times as well as holiday time share. And that each of them is responsible in maintaining for their shared childs needs (clothing, food, toiletries.etc) at their own residences where the child shares time.\n\nOp should also look into legal aid options, and if they haven't got everything straight in their life, to do so.

Mediators want to see these things from both parents, and appreciate if they don't have to keep making additional hearings and appointments because nobody has their shit together and ready to go.\n\nThe main thing to remember in family court, especially right now with how backed up courts are, is that it is not a place to FAFO!

Obviously it\u2019s not enough for a kid, but it\u2019s the best he could do. Where is he supposed to get another 100 a win from, the trees? Or go fishing for it?", "Im definitely going half on the daycare", "Since you're so hung up on the costs of raising a child here's how the math on the costs works out -\n\nUsing $12K per year since TN has a lower cost of living \n$12K per year divided by 52 gives you $231 per week approximately\n\nSince he has custody 2 full days of the week, he should only be paying child support for the remaining 5 days\n\n$231*5/7 to calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 days which works out to $164.8, and then half of that (split between the 2 parents) is $82.4\n\nI'm not even splitting the cost of his days between the 2 of them, since he is not the primary caregiver.", "You are all over this post just being loud and wrong", "The hell you on about?", "He has said that he has them Friday morning til Sunday night.", "The study you\u2019re quoting also wasn\u2019t based on OP\u2019s circumstances. This data was collected using variables that may not apply to this situation. Insurance for example is a huge cost factor and like other posters have said this could be funded by the state vs 1 of the parents. \n\nPer your article - \u201cNote: Nominal dollars. Based on a married, two-earner couple (with one child) that earns the U.S. median of $77,263 and switches from two individual workplace insurance plans to one workplace family plan.\u201d", "The 89 dollars is only what he's paying to his ex. He also has custody Friday to Monday, and pays for the child's expenses during that time. So the total paid for the child per week is definitely more than 89.", "Could I ask, why is $89 a week laughable? I'm not a parent myself, so I'm not very aware of what goes in the weekly expenses of a child. But considering the child is with dad Friday evenings and the weekend that's about $17.80 a day. If mum is contributing the same that would be about $35 a day for the child. Barring emergencies that should be quite sufficient I feel?", "The condom comment was completely unnecessary.", "Since mom has her 5/7s of the time and incurs the costs for that time at almost 71% her half should be even lower. So who do you think should cover the difference?", "It's great you're trying to get in a position to be more financially stable, and it's great you haven't abandoned either child. But $89/ week goes almost nowhere, and $250 for daycare is pretty reasonable. You having a second daughter didn't make your older daughter need less, so supporting your younger daughter doesn't mean anything. YTA for thinking what you're doing is adequate.", "NTA. You're paying your child support. She doesn't get to change child care and expect you to foot the bill.", "NTA if you were TA the judge would\u2019ve raised your child support payments instead of lowering them. I\u2019d suggest talking to a lawyer about the issues Baby Mama #1 is causing and keep records of your communication.", "NTA. you're supporting your children as best you can.

Once that is done, don't send extra. You are killing yourself. The ladies can also work. And they should not see you as a cash cow. If your kids need diapers and clothes buy them but if you see the ladies with new nails every week, vacationing then they aren't suffering but you ate", "hard to unpack all this.\n\nif you're in the US, let FOC take care of all of this.   \n\nThey'll compare incomes, factor in the custody arrangement, etc.\n\nyou don't have to deal with any nonsense outside of that, if you choose.", "Realistically, kids cost more than what child support covers. Also only getting them on the weekends means you probably skip out on the expensive part of child care when people work.", "Buddy, in USD, the dollar sign goes before the amount ($100, $89, etc.).", "Use two or three of them.  Hand jobs only.  Celibacy.  Whatever it takes to stop having kids!  But definitely NTA because you are doing your best", "I was leaning a bit to your way of thinking, but then I saw he has custody of both his daughters every single Fri-Sun. That\u2019s three days a week he takes full care of the oldest daughter. So that\u2019s three days less of daycare, three days less of the mom paying for things.", "That\u2019s great!   I wish you the best.  \n\nRemember too that these babies will grow up and remember everything you did or didn\u2019t do regardless of finances, so if you love them hard they\u2019ll be fine.", "The standard for dad's is literally on the ground. He doesn't \"help watch the kid\"...that's supposed to be called parenting. He's irresponsible and everyone is like \"it's all he can afford without suffering himself :( \" Yeah he's got 2 kids who are the priority. The burden is on the mom's and he just gets to do whatever is comfortable for him.", "Good!", "And then add that she is the primary care giver, and files the child on her taxes, gets the EIC, Tax credits, and Day care deductions from HER earnings. He is paying more than his share. But from the sounds of it, he would pay more to make sure his kid is taken care of, and is definately NTA on that alone.", "Found the mom!!!", "He said that but also claims to work overtime on Sundays. So is his mom or someone else watching the kids during that time? He's a weekend dad with a 2.5 day (max) timeshare.", "I don\u2019t have kids thanks God", "He has them Friday morning-Sunday night.", "Hmmm. I wonder. Puts a dent in dating and working. Kids get sick, they need all your attention.", "How do child support calculations work in the US if neither parent can afford to support the child? \n\nIf a child's minimum living expenses cost $12K and each parent can only afford $5K, does the court let the paying parent hand over their $5K and say \"sorry, that's all I can afford\" and then the parent with primary custody has to go without to cover both shares of the shortfall?", "35 bucks a day for a child isn\u2019t enough.

How is asking him to pay his fair share towards raising their child unfair to him?", "You are making a lot of of assumptions that we don't have the information to support.  You keep saying he is not paying half, but we don't know that the mother makes the same as OP.   If she makes more than OP she is supposed to pay more than him toward child costs.    You ignore the fact that there are many programs to pay the cost of raising a child so if they have equal income there is good chance that the government is paying part of the cost.   You are also assuming that all children have the same standard of living.   Some kids get new clothes, and others get used ones.   Some kids get extras like sports or music lessons, others don't."]}
