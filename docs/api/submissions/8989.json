I\u2019m 23 years old & I work in a warehouse. I had my first child at 18 and then my second at 21. I know for a fact I have made some risky choices in my past but I could never regret my daughters. Due to having two daughters early and not really having a career or a high paying job I haven\u2019t been very stable financially but I\u2019ve been getting by due to Memphis TN having a lower cost of living. I get around 35 hours at my warehouse job and I make 22 an hour. I could get a few more hours at my job but usually can\u2019t because I have my youngest daughter until her mother gets off work. I usually try to work every Sunday for overtime to get by. The mother of my oldest daughter is where the problem arises. I\u2019ve been sending the mother of my oldest daughter 100$ dollars a week out of every check regardless of what bill I have to pay or whether that 100$ would be my last since our daughter was born. I\u2019ve ran up my credit cards just to make those payments sometimes and I\u2019ve never missed a payment . The mother of my oldest daughter even told me she needed me to send even more than 100$ a week and when I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it because I support another child as well and I also have rent, car insurance, car note etc. The mother of my oldest child didn\u2019t like this so she filed child support. After the child support court case  the judge ordered I only had to pay her 89$ a week because I had so much credit from already sending her 100$ a week for 4 years straight. Now she\u2019s trying to make it seem like I\u2019m a deadbeat and recently put my oldest daughter in a daycare that costs 250$ a week without discussing it with me and is expecting me to pay the whole thing. AITA or am I just overthinking? I would have no problem supporting my oldest child as I\u2019ve been doing my best to do but she thinks I\u2019m just a walking bank or something. If I were to do all these things she wanted me to do I wouldn\u2019t have any money left to even take care of myself.\n\n\nUpdate* I think some of you are looking over the fact I have to support my youngest daughter as well I send her mother 100$ a week as well and I get both my daughters every Friday through Sunday.  I\u2019m also currently in college to help seek a better paying job so I won\u2019t be working in this warehouse for long", "created_utc": 1675390522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s892u/aita_for_not_sending_my_childs_mother_extra_money/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what the laws in TN are, but in some places, sending extra $$ for a regular service can be used as evidence that you can afford to pay *more* than the original order. \n\n\nThat said I want to make sure you understand, because most people don't, what that child support you're sending is supposed to do. \n\nThe way it works is the court says, okay, Dad makes $X and mom makes $Y and if they were living together child would have a standard of living which is $X and $Y for a 3 person household. But now the kid is living in a single parent household and without making anyone immediately homeless we have to make sure the child can still live at that standard. Or... as close as possible. \n\nSo they made up some figures that are supposed to recognize that, and apply those percentages to your $X and decide your payment. And that's supposed to go to the mom to offset your contribution to the kid's standard of living. So it's so mom can afford to pay the (the child's portion of) rent and utilities and diapers or whatever goes into *regular* household expenses. \n\nAll *greatly* oversimplified, but...\n\nThey don't factor in medical emergencies, or natural disasters, or any of the millions of random things that could come up. \n\nIf these things do come up, it's unlikely mom will be able to afford it alone. And this is still your child, so it would be fair and reasonable to pay whatever portion needs to be paid to yknow... make sure your child has their needs met.\n\nI'm sure you already knew that, but some people don't, so it bears saying.\n\nSidenote: $250/week for daycare isn't much. The national average cost in 2021 was $226/week for a toddler, and $261/week for after school care. \n\nSome places are higher, and some lower, but it's only gotten more expensive since then. I know it seems like an insane amount of money, but... that's likely not some \"expensive\" day care, just... day care. Kid has to be somewhere while mom's at work, right?\n\nAnyway, still totally NTA, but some things to consider. \n\nBest of luck to you and both your children!", "You were giving her $100 a week for four years BEFORE the courts stepped in and said, \u201c$89\u201d.

Plus, there may be places that do a sliding scale based on income if she's struggling that bad with daycare fees. Could be worth looking into.", "NTA, you're doing all you can. Make sure you keep looking at new employment opportunities and take them when they'll get you higher pay and better working environment!", "NTA\n\nYou where sending $100 a week which is what you could barley afford.\nShe wanted more that you couldn't afford so she went the legal route to try and make you pay more.

The way the courts look at it, whichever parent has the child more should provide more. Not saying it's fair, but it is logical and just. If the court determined $89 was his portion for the time she isn't with him, then he was already doing more than necessary. The daycare thing is just plain spite.

Obviously costs increase as the child grows older so the $10,034 a year isn't accurate from infant to legal adult, but neither is the $16,546 a year. If $16,546 was hands down the cost every year than it would be $297,828 over the course of 18 years.

I wouldn\u2019t expect someone to go hungry or homeless just because I want more money from them.", "Again, court-assigned child support is based on how much a person makes, not how much it costs to raise a child. The 16k is an average for a reason, and the younger children are the more expensive they are, so right now child care for that baby is at the higher end.", "She was getting less than half of what it takes to raise a child and needed more help. Mom can\u2019t come up with the \u201cI don\u2019t have it excuse\u201d she literally has to have it but he gets to get away with it?\n\nYou\u2019re acting like she wants more money for herself and not to help raise his daughter", "I guess it\u2019s ok if mom & kids end up homeless because he can\u2019t afford to pay enough to adequately support them. $89 a week is a damn joke.", "\"Costs keep adding up as children grow older\"\n\nSo are we not even going by the source data you provided anymore? Pretty sure the more food a human needs increases the expense cost. Hey, I'm just following the numbers you kindly shared.", "Honestly, I can\u2019t believe these replies. 89 bucks a week is nothing.", "Of course it\u2019s nothing. But it\u2019s what the courts ordered. Everyone on this sub is always so quick \u201cstick to what the court says\u201d but not when it comes to child support. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s not an active father. He\u2019s there for his kids, AND he keeps his daughter until the mom gets off work too. So pls. I have a kid. I know exactly how much money it takes to raise a child. But I also know that if his father only makes a certain amount of money, and I also work and only have one kid compared to the two he has, i wouldn\u2019t be mad if he could only afford 100$ a week. If the roles were reversed y\u2019all would all be saying \u201cwell mom is doing the best she can, she can only afford so much\u201d\n\nEdit to add: mom and kid won\u2019t go hungry or homeless unless mom is banking on child support to get by. She has a job too."]}
