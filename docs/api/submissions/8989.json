I\u2019m 23 years old & I work in a warehouse. I had my first child at 18 and then my second at 21. I know for a fact I have made some risky choices in my past but I could never regret my daughters. Due to having two daughters early and not really having a career or a high paying job I haven\u2019t been very stable financially but I\u2019ve been getting by due to Memphis TN having a lower cost of living. I get around 35 hours at my warehouse job and I make 22 an hour. I could get a few more hours at my job but usually can\u2019t because I have my youngest daughter until her mother gets off work. I usually try to work every Sunday for overtime to get by. The mother of my oldest daughter is where the problem arises. I\u2019ve been sending the mother of my oldest daughter (my youngest daughter\u2019s mother too) 100$ dollars a week out of every check regardless of what bill I have to pay or whether that 100$ would be my last since our daughter was born. I\u2019ve ran up my credit cards just to make those payments sometimes and I\u2019ve never missed a payment . The mother of my oldest daughter even told me she needed me to send even more than 100$ a week and when I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it because I support another child as well and I also have rent, car insurance, car note etc. The mother of my oldest child didn\u2019t like this so she filed child support. After the child support court case  the judge ordered I only had to pay her 89$ a week because I had so much credit from already sending her 100$ a week for 4 years straight. Now she\u2019s trying to make it seem like I\u2019m a deadbeat and recently put my oldest daughter in a daycare that costs 250$ a week without discussing it with me and is expecting me to pay the whole thing. AITA or am I just overthinking? I would have no problem supporting my oldest child as I\u2019ve been doing my best to do but she thinks I\u2019m just a walking bank or something. If I were to do all these things she wanted me to do I wouldn\u2019t have any money left to even take care of myself.\n\n\nUpdate* I think some of you are looking over the fact I have to support my youngest daughter as well I send her mother 100$ a week as well and I get both my daughters every Friday through Sunday.  I\u2019m also currently in college to help seek a better paying job so I won\u2019t be working in this warehouse for long", "created_utc": 1675390522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s892u/aita_for_not_sending_my_childs_mother_extra_money/", "score": 995, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what the laws in TN are, but in some places, sending extra $$ for a regular service can be used as evidence that you can afford to pay *more* than the original order. \n\n\nThat said I want to make sure you understand, because most people don't, what that child support you're sending is supposed to do. \n\nThe way it works is the court says, okay, Dad makes $X and mom makes $Y and if they were living together child would have a standard of living which is $X and $Y for a 3 person household. But now the kid is living in a single parent household and without making anyone immediately homeless we have to make sure the child can still live at that standard. Or... as close as possible. \n\nSo they made up some figures that are supposed to recognize that, and apply those percentages to your $X and decide your payment. And that's supposed to go to the mom to offset your contribution to the kid's standard of living. So it's so mom can afford to pay the (the child's portion of) rent and utilities and diapers or whatever goes into *regular* household expenses. \n\nAll *greatly* oversimplified, but...\n\nThey don't factor in medical emergencies, or natural disasters, or any of the millions of random things that could come up. \n\nIf these things do come up, it's unlikely mom will be able to afford it alone. And this is still your child, so it would be fair and reasonable to pay whatever portion needs to be paid to yknow... make sure your child has their needs met.\n\nI'm sure you already knew that, but some people don't, so it bears saying.\n\nSidenote: $250/week for daycare isn't much. The national average cost in 2021 was $226/week for a toddler, and $261/week for after school care. \n\nSome places are higher, and some lower, but it's only gotten more expensive since then. I know it seems like an insane amount of money, but... that's likely not some \"expensive\" day care, just... day care. Kid has to be somewhere while mom's at work, right?\n\nAnyway, still totally NTA, but some things to consider. \n\nBest of luck to you and both your children!", "You were giving her $100 a week for four years BEFORE the courts stepped in and said, \u201c$89\u201d.

Plus, there may be places that do a sliding scale based on income if she's struggling that bad with daycare fees. Could be worth looking into.", "NTA, you're doing all you can. Make sure you keep looking at new employment opportunities and take them when they'll get you higher pay and better working environment!", "NTA\n\nYou where sending $100 a week which is what you could barley afford.\nShe wanted more that you couldn't afford so she went the legal route to try and make you pay more.

The way the courts look at it, whichever parent has the child more should provide more. Not saying it's fair, but it is logical and just. If the court determined $89 was his portion for the time she isn't with him, then he was already doing more than necessary. The daycare thing is just plain spite.

Divide in half for each parent = 19.18 per day per parent. 19.18*4 = 76.72. That would theoretically be his half of the expenses for the time she is with her mother. (Feel free to check my math, I did it twice but might have missed something)\n\nAlso if you're gonna argue about splitting costs- why is he responsible for providing for his child while she is not with him, but the mother is not expected to do the same? If she is the primary caregiver, she is also eligible for assistance, while he would not be. So while he is paying out of pocket for all expenses, she could qualify for SNAP, possibly medicaid, TANF, etc. When I had WIC (kids under 5) and SNAP, and took advantage of the Double Up Bucks program, I was able to feed myself and my kid for about $100 PER MONTH (Bulk section is your friend) She definitely sounds like this is pettiness, and maybe poor financial management, not true costs. \n\nHe is and has been paying more than his fair share.", "Some of you ppl crack me up- my kids father pays me $150 a month and that\u2019s for 2 kids!

That information would be laid out in the current support order issued on file.\n\nI can say that this is something that judges in the family court system see often enough that if it's obvious she's being spiteful and punishing him for the court order, this is going to piss their judge off! What Op should be doing is building a FU binder with all their records, proof of past and current payments, a past and current calendar of when they had their shared child in his custody, print outs of all her text/emails. Evidence of hostility. Call recording if legal in their state. And a complete list of child care facilities, the cost and median average.\n\nThe ex will need to provide a reason for the sudden need and use of child care.

Is clearly laid out, has right of first refusal if Op feels that's in the best interest of their shared child. Is clear on pick-up, drop-off locations and times as well as holiday time share. And that each of them is responsible in maintaining for their shared childs needs (clothing, food, toiletries.etc) at their own residences where the child shares time.\n\nOp should also look into legal aid options, and if they haven't got everything straight in their life, to do so.

Mediators want to see these things from both parents, and appreciate if they don't have to keep making additional hearings and appointments because nobody has their shit together and ready to go.\n\nThe main thing to remember in family court, especially right now with how backed up courts are, is that it is not a place to FAFO!

Where\u2019s his sacrifice?  He\u2019s not said where his $3300 a month goes and I bet there\u2019s a lot of selfish expenses there.  Which is fine if you don\u2019t have responsibilities.", "You do realize that number is before taxes, right?  As well as if he has insurance through the company.  After taxes, and deductions, his bring home MIGHT be $2000 a month, but not likely.  Once paying to keep a roof over his head, amd electricity that leaves him maybe $1000 to pay for groceries, car insurance, car payment, and phone.  All of that adds up to another $500-$800 a month.  He pays $756 a month between both kids so where exactly is the additional $250 a week coming from?", "Yea any future possible kids thank God too.", "Nope. Looking at the facts.  Men more often than not do not step up enough. And he\u2019s being called a good guy for doing the bare minimum.", "Gee I wonder if mom has the option to do that. Probably not since she\u2019s saddled with the majority of time & expenses in raising their child.", "He's paying $100 a week for both. Good grief. And she's clearly just getting revenge", "Unfortunately, misogyny is alive and well everywhere. I\u2019m not worried about down votes though lol\n\nDad is getting congratulated for doing the bare minimum of being a good dad while mom is stuck with the extra costs of raising the child alone and she\u2019s \u201cgreedy\u201d for asking for more.", "It\u2019s why he should live with his parents & drive a beater car or bike to work.  He has responsibilities.", "I don\u2019t ever want kids lol I\u2019m trying to retire by 45 and kids will throw that off by 15-20 years.", "Stop with your BS. Quit.", "She's stuck with half of the time, idk why you can't understand that. She has the kid four days and he has the kid thee days. That's barely over half. And she's putting the kid in day care anyway. It's not OPs problem if she didn't chose to go to school or whatever. He's trying to better his situation to be able to afford more for his daughters. That's good of him.", "Omg such revenge!!  Needing help with Childcare so she can go to work!!  Call Fox News!!", "\"I get around 35 hours at my warehouse job and I make 22 an hour. I could get a few more hours at my job but usually can\u2019t because I have my youngest daughter until her mother gets off work. \"", "Exactly!   How greedy to want him to pay for childcare while she works! Smh! \n\nI\u2019d love to see the roles reversed.", "And if that isn't an option?  On top of that he has both of his children every weekend.  Who says his parents have the space for him to have his children or they will allow them to be there?", "Yea you sound exhausting. Kids would most definitely be better off without you.", "The truth is not BS \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And I'll point out -- as someone else already did -- she didn't need this excessively expensive childcare until she found out she couldn't get more money out of him any other way. She needs to get a grip and move on, he's not going back to her", "Yes, if the roles were reversed, she should have to pay half for child care so he could also work. Why is this so hard to understand? I\u2019m not attacking him because he\u2019s a dad trying his best. I\u2019m trying to get him to understand it\u2019s not enough.", "Ok, I the only one I saw was that he said he had her from Friday to Sunday. Both work Fridays so I was assuming he got her after work Friday and dropped her off before he went to work on Sunday", "Wish we could get baby mommas perspective on this.   He said he sometimes works Sundays so I doubt he really has them every weekend.", "And it's ok if he goes homeless by overpaying support?", "Nope pay what court told you too. Normally I would say help the child but mom wanted to be greedy and got the correct amount. Do stuff for you daughter extra when she\u2019s with you forget about mom.", "You do NOT have to pay for the daycare she is putting the child in unless you have an amended Child support order. Don\u2019t give her a dollar more", "NTA. The court said you only have to pay $89 a week; that\u2019s ALL you have to pay, whatever form of childcare the mother is using. If the mother can\u2019t afford the childcare, maybe she should look into applying for CCDF, if she is low income herself. \n\nAnd btw, maybe you should consider going to court for a formal child support agreement for your other child as well, just so everything is above board? That could also work out in your favor", "NTA!!!! Stuff like this pisses me tf off. This man is trying his best to provide and they want more \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f WHERE IS THE MONEY GONNA COME FROM? It\u2019s not as if they were dating Kanye or somethin \ud83e\udd28", "NAH. Your oldest childs mother thought she was owed more. She took you to court and found out she was wrong.  The court decides how much is fair - not her.", "NTA. This is why it\u2019s always best to do things through the legal system rather than trying to place nice. Child support through the courts, and have a parenting plan in place that says your child\u2019s mother cannot change daycares without permission. Good idea to consult a lawyer and get a parenting plan that addresses any potential issues.", "NTA - the number of children you have is not germane to the argument. But, a judge has ruled what your responsibilities are and you are keeping up to date on them.\n\nContinue on.", "Wow.  She takes care of the child during the week. op only sees her on weekends.  $89 barely covers 3 days of groceries.  She is paying for everything else.  Clothes, gas, toys, food, school supplies.  That is a lot more than $89.  And yes,   He should also be responsible for childcare because that\u2019s his child.  Is she supposed to be unemployed and stay at home to watch the kid AND pay for everything for the daughter? Besides, quality day cares are like $30-40k a year. $250 a week is a steal.  This thread is full of deadbeats.", "I get $0 a month for three children but it\u2019s honestly laughable to me how many people in this thread think $100 a week is enough to support a child. Childcare alone is $1000 a month and I\u2019m assuming the mother works which is why the child is in daycare. So once you add health insurance, food, and clothes that can easily go up to $1500 a month and then you can add extracurriculars for the child even though those aren\u2019t considered necessities.  Now if dad had custody thought the week, he would HAVE to figure out how to pay for daycare so he can work just like his child\u2019s mother is doing. That would be $1000 out of his pocket not just $400. The mother needs to also have a roof over her head and a way to pay her own bills, she can\u2019t just sit around and live off of $400 a month in child support. \n\nSo OP is NTA for the court determining his payment but he is a AH for thinking his kids mom is putting the kid in daycare to spite him. It\u2019s not her fault he had another kid. He needs to have a better plan, better job or something because of something does happen to the mom and he thinks $400 will be enough to have a daycare aged child full time he\u2019s in for a rude awakening.", "That's child support he's willing to 50/50 on daycare but EX wants him to cover it 100% he also pays for her insurance and anything she needs when she's with him.", "When the parents are separated, one parent can\u2019t make a financial decision and expect the other parent to automatically agree and pay half. \n\nThe ex could have asked for money for daycare, but didn\u2019t. She can return to court and ask for a modification to cover the childcare expense.", "So the courts, who have even more information than this thread gives, deemed he was paying over what was necessary in child support and lowered it, but you random person on reddit dispute their conclusions? \n\nThe ex is using the child as a pawn to get what she wants. They both had the kid, they should both be involved in that type of decision on daycare. He has her on weekends as well as paying child support. NTA by a long shot.\n\nAlso are you for real about that being 3 days of groceries? He is only paying towards his child's food, which he should pay no more than half of, so you think 3 days worth of groceries for a young kid is $178. What kind of groceries are you buying?\n\nETA: She doesn't pay for 'everything else', he buys and contributes extra where necessary", "The courts determined his support payment. He's meeting that.  Mom is getting state and federal welfare support in the form of Medicaid, food stamps, day care assistance, tax credit, etc.", "$30-$40k a year is not the average, especially for Memphis.", "Have you been to a grocery store in the last year? No, $100 isnt gold. She has the child during the week. Dad sees her on weekends. Who is taking her to school and paying for gas? Who buys food and cooks meals? Who who is buying school supplies? Clothes? I grew it of my shoes and clothes every couple months until I hit high school.  $89 isn\u2019t shit.", "And in his post, he wants to pay the court-ordered $89.  If he only pays that, that is an asshole move.  He only has the daughter on the weekend.  Mom is feeding and providing for her for the week.  $89 barely buys me 3 days worth of groceries nowadays. If he\u2019s struggling, wonder how mom is doing since she is responsible for most of the care.", "I don\u2019t think anyone else caught on to your sarcasm lol", "She's low income. She will qualify for assistance to pay for childcare.  She would never pay the full $250.00 per week.", "I live in Tennessee. I paid $1800 a month for 2 kids in 2017 so I could work full time. I didn\u2019t get child support from my ex at all either. I filed for it but because my ex was jobless, they only ordered him to pay $16 a week and he hasn\u2019t even paid that in 5 years lol. \n\nI married my husband and we had two more kids and now we just alternate work schedules because childcare costs more than our rent and grocery bill combined. People always forget that if the custodial parent is working that they\u2019re probably paying more than a child support payment in daycare alone. But you have to do it to be able to pay your own bills.", "My comment was in reference that most mothers don't get that. My mother got 200 a month and she had me all month", "Kid isn't in school. And the OP already answered those questions.", "I bet your the ex aren't you?", "There is no way she's paying that. She would probably qualify for income assistance for childcare.", "IRK. He has to provide her with a place to live during those three days. Is he supposed to live out of his car? They are also not factoring in any of the state and federal welfare benefits that mom is getting and he isn't.", "Where? In the OP original post he says no such thing.", "A lot of kids doing start until 6 because of where their birthday lands (they have to be 5 so many months before the start of school) or being red shirted for not being ready for 1st grade", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s892u/aita_for_not_sending_my_childs_mother_extra_money/j70v3o8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n> she\u2019s with me from Friday Morning all the way till Sunday Night", "I bet your the EX who wants him to pay 100% of the child care since he's cool with 50/50.", "But wouldn\u2019t they be i \nN pre k?", "It really is location dependant. My daughter, for example, turned 6 right after school starts because of when her birthday is. \n\nI'm in Indiana, so pre-k isn't required and isn't covered like k-12 as far as cost. There are also sometimes wait lists for school sponsored pre-k.\n\nBecause of the cost and because it wasn't required, and because I worked from home 3/5 days, she just went to a sitter a couple of days out of the week", "Rent in itself is crazy high plus add a vehicle and insurance? Sounds like necessities so far. Add utilities, groceries and another child...where is his fun money? Looks like the guy is doing his best here", "He was freaking paying more the mom wanted more went to court the courts decided he was paying too much and dropped it down he did not go asking to pay less. Also he's cool with paying 50/50 for daycare why should he be on the hook for 100% just because you had a bad experience with a man doesn't mean all men have to kill themselves paying for everything. The Ex doesn't pay the kids insurance he does ex gets the kid 4 days he gets 3 days.  And based off your other comments your either A your the ex or B just straight up man hater.", "It\u2019s laughable that people think $100 a week is enough to support a child. I paid $1800 a month for two kids to go to daycare so I could work.  ( I live in Tennessee too). Most child support payments don\u2019t even cover half that. How do you expect the mother to be able to pay her own bills if she doesn\u2019t work? Not everyone has free babysitters.", "It's not laughable, it's really sad that you're projecting your trauma onto these strangers. Daycare is part of a child support calculation. Mom here CLEARLY changed daycare to try to hurt her ex. Seek counseling", "Prob can't find a partner either, because who tf would wanna be shackled to this irritating asshole? \ud83d\ude02", "Thats just child care. Not food, clothing, or shelter."]}
