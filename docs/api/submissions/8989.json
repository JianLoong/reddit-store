I\u2019m 23 years old & I work in a warehouse. I had my first child at 18 and then my second at 21. I know for a fact I have made some risky choices in my past but I could never regret my daughters. Due to having two daughters early and not really having a career or a high paying job I haven\u2019t been very stable financially but I\u2019ve been getting by due to Memphis TN having a lower cost of living. I get around 35 hours at my warehouse job and I make 22 an hour. I could get a few more hours at my job but usually can\u2019t because I have my youngest daughter until her mother gets off work. I usually try to work every Sunday for overtime to get by. The mother of my oldest daughter is where the problem arises. I\u2019ve been sending the mother of my oldest daughter (my youngest daughter\u2019s mother too) 100$ dollars a week out of every check regardless of what bill I have to pay or whether that 100$ would be my last since our daughter was born. I\u2019ve ran up my credit cards just to make those payments sometimes and I\u2019ve never missed a payment . The mother of my oldest daughter even told me she needed me to send even more than 100$ a week and when I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it because I support another child as well and I also have rent, car insurance, car note etc. The mother of my oldest child didn\u2019t like this so she filed child support. After the child support court case  the judge ordered I only had to pay her 89$ a week because I had so much credit from already sending her 100$ a week for 4 years straight. Now she\u2019s trying to make it seem like I\u2019m a deadbeat and recently put my oldest daughter in a daycare that costs 250$ a week without discussing it with me and is expecting me to pay the whole thing. AITA or am I just overthinking? I would have no problem supporting my oldest child as I\u2019ve been doing my best to do but she thinks I\u2019m just a walking bank or something. If I were to do all these things she wanted me to do I wouldn\u2019t have any money left to even take care of myself.\n\n\nUpdate* I think some of you are looking over the fact I have to support my youngest daughter as well I send her mother 100$ a week as well and I get both my daughters every Friday through Sunday.  I\u2019m also currently in college to help seek a better paying job so I won\u2019t be working in this warehouse for long", "created_utc": 1675390522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s892u/aita_for_not_sending_my_childs_mother_extra_money/", "score": 628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what the laws in TN are, but in some places, sending extra $$ for a regular service can be used as evidence that you can afford to pay *more* than the original order. \n\n\nThat said I want to make sure you understand, because most people don't, what that child support you're sending is supposed to do. \n\nThe way it works is the court says, okay, Dad makes $X and mom makes $Y and if they were living together child would have a standard of living which is $X and $Y for a 3 person household. But now the kid is living in a single parent household and without making anyone immediately homeless we have to make sure the child can still live at that standard. Or... as close as possible. \n\nSo they made up some figures that are supposed to recognize that, and apply those percentages to your $X and decide your payment. And that's supposed to go to the mom to offset your contribution to the kid's standard of living. So it's so mom can afford to pay the (the child's portion of) rent and utilities and diapers or whatever goes into *regular* household expenses. \n\nAll *greatly* oversimplified, but...\n\nThey don't factor in medical emergencies, or natural disasters, or any of the millions of random things that could come up. \n\nIf these things do come up, it's unlikely mom will be able to afford it alone. And this is still your child, so it would be fair and reasonable to pay whatever portion needs to be paid to yknow... make sure your child has their needs met.\n\nI'm sure you already knew that, but some people don't, so it bears saying.\n\nSidenote: $250/week for daycare isn't much. The national average cost in 2021 was $226/week for a toddler, and $261/week for after school care. \n\nSome places are higher, and some lower, but it's only gotten more expensive since then. I know it seems like an insane amount of money, but... that's likely not some \"expensive\" day care, just... day care. Kid has to be somewhere while mom's at work, right?\n\nAnyway, still totally NTA, but some things to consider. \n\nBest of luck to you and both your children!", "You were giving her $100 a week for four years BEFORE the courts stepped in and said, \u201c$89\u201d.

Plus, there may be places that do a sliding scale based on income if she's struggling that bad with daycare fees. Could be worth looking into.", "NTA, you're doing all you can. Make sure you keep looking at new employment opportunities and take them when they'll get you higher pay and better working environment!", "NTA\n\nYou where sending $100 a week which is what you could barley afford.\nShe wanted more that you couldn't afford so she went the legal route to try and make you pay more.

The way the courts look at it, whichever parent has the child more should provide more. Not saying it's fair, but it is logical and just. If the court determined $89 was his portion for the time she isn't with him, then he was already doing more than necessary. The daycare thing is just plain spite.

Obviously costs increase as the child grows older so the $10,034 a year isn't accurate from infant to legal adult, but neither is the $16,546 a year. If $16,546 was hands down the cost every year than it would be $297,828 over the course of 18 years.

Divide in half for each parent = 19.18 per day per parent. 19.18*4 = 76.72. That would theoretically be his half of the expenses for the time she is with her mother. (Feel free to check my math, I did it twice but might have missed something)\n\nAlso if you're gonna argue about splitting costs- why is he responsible for providing for his child while she is not with him, but the mother is not expected to do the same? If she is the primary caregiver, she is also eligible for assistance, while he would not be. So while he is paying out of pocket for all expenses, she could qualify for SNAP, possibly medicaid, TANF, etc. When I had WIC (kids under 5) and SNAP, and took advantage of the Double Up Bucks program, I was able to feed myself and my kid for about $100 PER MONTH (Bulk section is your friend) She definitely sounds like this is pettiness, and maybe poor financial management, not true costs. \n\nHe is and has been paying more than his fair share.", "Some of you ppl crack me up- my kids father pays me $150 a month and that\u2019s for 2 kids!

That information would be laid out in the current support order issued on file.\n\nI can say that this is something that judges in the family court system see often enough that if it's obvious she's being spiteful and punishing him for the court order, this is going to piss their judge off! What Op should be doing is building a FU binder with all their records, proof of past and current payments, a past and current calendar of when they had their shared child in his custody, print outs of all her text/emails. Evidence of hostility. Call recording if legal in their state. And a complete list of child care facilities, the cost and median average.\n\nThe ex will need to provide a reason for the sudden need and use of child care.

Is clearly laid out, has right of first refusal if Op feels that's in the best interest of their shared child. Is clear on pick-up, drop-off locations and times as well as holiday time share. And that each of them is responsible in maintaining for their shared childs needs (clothing, food, toiletries.etc) at their own residences where the child shares time.\n\nOp should also look into legal aid options, and if they haven't got everything straight in their life, to do so.

Be ready with an action plan to show the courts of countinuing education, job training, the steps being taken to do so.  All that jazz.) Mediators want to see these things from both parents, and appreciate if they don't have to keep making additional hearings and appointments because nobody has their shit together and ready to go.\n\nThe main thing to remember in family court, especially right now with how backed up courts are, is that it is not a place to FAFO!
