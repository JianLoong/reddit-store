We were practically raised together. We were closer in college, but after that we have been drifting apart a little but I still had a strong bond with her up until recently. She has been there for me a lot and I have too so its tough, this situation.\n\nAfter college, when Izzy was like 23, she went on a few dates with Jake (my fianc\u00e9) but then told him she wasn't interested in anything serious. Even though I was her best friend, I didn't really know Jake because she used to get asked out a lot, but only a few turned serious. So I knew about her boyfriends, but not necessarily her dates.\n\nAlmost a year after that, I moved in with Izzy and so we got close again. It was after this that I met Jake. We quickly became good friends. I used to talk about him to Izzy a lot, but its when I showed her his picture that she recognised him and told me about her dates with him. Friendships were more important to me that any guy back then so I  asked her if it was okay to date him because I liked him a lot. She said she had no problem and joked about it ever turning into a relationship, which I took as a joke.\n\nJake and I became serious very quick, he is my soulmate. By then though, Izzy and I  lost touch a bit since I moved in with Jake, and work became more of a priority. Right until I got engaged, she used to still joke to both me and Jake that she didn't think we would be this into each other, and at that time I saw it as funny because Jake is the opposite of me. After I got engaged, she became very weird. She was very shocked, and  would not believe it. Then later she used to tell me I'm too young to be married and if I'm sure, but I saw this as just concern. Although she agreed to be my MOH along with my sister.\n\nAfterwards, I posted on my Instagram about our engagement and people were reposting it and congratulating us. But Izzy just captioned it saying \"you better mention me in your vows because he was into me first haha\". Jake felt very uncomfortable, and so did I but I defended her saying that, its just izzy, she jokes around a lot. But I still let her know that it was a bit uncomfortable and she said that she was just joking.\n\nAfter Christmas, we hosted a dinner party and that day, izzy just kept telling all the friends and family gathered that Jake dated her first, she let me have him, stuff like that. Even after telling her it was not okay, she joked around. Later I told her that she was crossing my boundaries and that it was not okay, to which she said I was overreacting. In the end I told her to not attend my wedding at all.\n\nI have been overthinking a lot after that. Right now, people who know about this are just choosing sides based on who they know more. I'm worried I'm ruining a lifelong friendship when I'm not even right. What if to her it really was just a joke and I'm not being understanding. But she is not being supportive or positive, which I think is unfair.

I think that she loses any right to claim it was \"just a joke\" when you've expressed that it makes you uncomfortable and asked her to stop. You have every right to enforce your boundaries, even if that means ending a long friendship. If she was a good friend, she would value your feelings over her need for attention - which is clearly what this is about, in my opinion. Also, it's weird that people are choosing sides in this - there is literally no reason for it and they should really start behaving like adults.", "NTA. I think she put you in a super tough position. You asked her to stop and she wouldn't, and so she kind of forced your hand. Those statements are awkward AF - I'm sure those who heard her joking about it found it odd - but also really diminishing of your relationship. The other things you mention - her shock and denial of your engagement - also suggest she is kind of mentally hung up on this and that's too bad, but not your fault. \n\nIf she'd just stopped when you asked her to, even if she felt you were being overly sensitive, this would all be in the past. But she wouldn't. I would like to say you could have just told her to step down as an attendant but I think that would have left room for a lot of drama so this was probably appropriate. \n\nTo the extent there is fallout with other friends, well that's on them. Your friends - even if they are also hers - should be focused on supporting and celebrating your marriage. There is no need to choose sides and if they knew the reality was that she was making embarrassing, degrading jokes persistently at your expense, despite your request that she can it, I would imagine they'd understand.", "NTA. Kick her out and leave her out for good. She is jealous and insecure. She sees what you have and either wishes she had stayed with him, or wishes she found someone too. It\u2019s disgusting the way she\u2019s making your special day all about her.", "She's too pride to let things go. In her eyes, you found love in a man she dismissed, and that is simply not possible. Hence she's there \"I was here first\".\n\nImo you made the right choice, who knows what kind of behavior she'll display when her pride will turn into jealousy at a crucial moment.\n\nNTA", "NTA. When you repeatedly ask a friend to stop making a comment that bothers you and they continue? In public no less? That's not a real friend.\n\nAfterthought: Reinvite her, but only if the best man makes repeated references to the terrible taste the groom used to have in women, what vapid girls he used to date etc.", "NTA...She's being incredibly tacky.  Anyone can cross a line in a moment of weakness, but you gave her more than one warning.  If she doesn't care how she makes (both of) you feel,  joke or not, then why overthink cutting her off?  Move on and feel no guilt.", "NTA\n\nIzzy is showing her pick me girl colours.", "NTA. \"I'm worried I'm ruining a lifelong friendship.\" There's an old saying that goes, \"With a friend like this who needs enemies.\" She excluded herself not only from your wedding but your life. Go enjoy your wedding day and don't give this mean spirited, jealous woman a second thought.", "NTA\n\n\"\u00a0izzy just kept telling all the friends and family gathered that Jake dated her first, she let me have him, stuff like that.\"\n\n**Just smile and add to her story: Sometimes you have to kiss a few frogs before you find a princess.**", "BAsed on what you've said, you've given her multiple chances.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are in the right.  Once was a funny little joke.  hahahahahahahahahahahaha.   The 5th time ,  its not funny.   The 10th time, its annoying.   The 20th time it sounding kinda pathetic.   \n The 80th time, its like \"What the Hell Izzy?\".  And honestly, it wasn't that funny the first time.  I feel like I've heard that joke a thousand times at weddings (if I include real weddings AND TV show/movie weddings.  Probably 15 or 16  times only at real weddings) .  Its joke #4 in the \"standard jokes for best men/Maid of honor speeches\".  Its trite and overused. \n\nOne would have thought that the 1st time you told her to knock it off, that would have been it.  The 2nd or third time you said it,  any real friend would have, well, knocked it off.   One questions how good a friend Izzy really is.  \n\nIn my inexpert opinion there is obviously something else going on with Izzy.  I'm not saying that she has been secretly in love with Jake or something.  But you've taken what she considered a castoff and found something/created something wonderful and of substance, and so she's feeling quite insecure about herself.   Maybe it hit her that she's 27 and not 23,  maybe its straight up a general sense of jealousy that you are getting married and she's trying to take you down a peg or 5.   A hundred different things going on in her mind.  \n\nIt sucks that your friendship is coming down to this.   But Izzy is the one forcing the issue, not you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA she's jealous and insecure and is trying to belittle you because of it.\n\nA joke amongst friends stops being a joke once it starts causing problems or makes the person at the centre of it uncomfortable/unhappy.", "Izzy sounds scorned and isn\u2019t a friend.\nIf she isn\u2019t happy for you now, she won\u2019t ever be.\nAnd friends can grow apart.\n\nThe wedding is yours and Jake\u2019s big day. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about who you do and don\u2019t want your invite. \n\nThe very fact that you are questioning un-inviting her simply means you don\u2019t want her there.", "I don't think a 'friend' would go around telling everyone that it's cool for you to have her leftovers which is essentially what she's doing. You might want to point that out to the nay sayers.\n\nBest wishes for your marriage.", "NTA you absolutely did the right thing in my opinion. She's jealous and will try to embarrass you or tear you down any chance she gets now that it's gotten to this point.", "NTA.  It sounds like Izzy is trying to steal away the attention that is on you, and she\u2019s probably jealous that your relationship with Jake worked out so well.\n\nI would be concerned that this behavior isn\u2019t going to end, and ten years from now she\u2019ll be making the same awkward jokes to your children.", "NTA\u2026. She is jealous that you are getting married first and therefore is trying to cause a scene and make it weird.\n\nGiven you already ask her to calm down on it and she isn\u2019t means she is doing it on purpose. So yeah just give up on the friendship", "NTA, although I think you and Izzy have a definition of \"best friend\" that the rest of us aren't familiar with.", "NTA but Izzy is really embarrassing herself with this", "NTA,\n\nDoes she do this regularly or is this the first time she's acted like this? \n\n1. If she acts like this regularly, she is a bad friend who is constantly crossing your boundaries.\n2. If this is the first time she has acted this way, she may still have a thing for him and trying to get in between the two of you.\n\nEither way, I think this as a friendship that needs to be dropped.", "NTA The \u201cjust joking\u201d excuse only works once after that she knew it bothered you and Jake and yet she kept going. She sounds jealous and bitter. If you let her come to the wedding she might try to make it all about her.", "It was *not* just a joke. The fact that you asked her to stop and she kept doing it makes it clear that she was trying to express something. I suspect jealousy or insecurity, but I could be wrong. NTA.", "NTA\nShe's not your real friend\nShe is a jealous and bilious person\nStop communicating with her and believe me, it will become much easier for you", "NTA. Boundaries are personal and often not about right or wrong. If two people can't live with each others boundaries, then they're not compatible... that applies for friends too.\n\nYou set a boundary that Izzy couldn't live with. That means you two need some more distance. You don't need to spend any time on whether your boundary is reasonable or not.", "INFO:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion - out of curiosity, does Jake recall how it ended with Izzy?   Does his version agree with hers?  i.e. you say Izzy more or less broke it off after a few dates saying she didn't want anything serious.   Does Jake's version of the events match up?", "NTA.  She's either a) not actually OK with any of this and using humor to deflect or b) she's an attention-seeker.  In both cases, she shouldn't be involved with the wedding.", "NTA.  It's not a joke if you aren't laughing.  You told her several times her 'jokes' weren't funny and to stop, but she didn't.  Looking at all of that from the outside, it sounds like jealousy that you are getting what she wants and she had a chance (maybe) and blew it.  She is mad and upset and is dealing with that poorly.  You have done all you can to dial down the trash-talk.  Cutting ties is truly your only option.", "You're not wrong. Back when you started dating your now fiance, you ask her permission to date him and she conceded, which you had no obligation to. So she can't act territorial now just because she thought you two wouldn't last. \n\nNTA. Friends come and friends go. This specific friend of yours doesn't respect you as you respect her.", "Izzy is insecure. Izzy doesn't respect you. Izzy will ruin your wedding.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Toxic and jealous. Don\u2019t let her come or she will ruin the whole day!", "Unfortunately your friend is jealous.\n\nWould I be right in thinking that for all her many dates and partners, she has not met someone wanting to make a commitment to her?\n\nYou don't have to expect anyone else to take a side but the friendship would be over for me too. You spoke to her about your discomfort. Once is enough. Your fiancee went of a few meaningless dates with her and she is trying to make it into----something. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe told her \"joke.\" Did anyone laugh? You told her to stop. She didn't. Why are you afraid to lose her friendship when she clearly isn't afraid to lose yours?", "NTA, your friend sounds like a real asshole. You have every right to want her outta your wedding after she keeps running her mouth about dating your fianc\u00e9. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for setting boundaries and sticking up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nSorry but she isn't behaving like a friend. You asked her nicely to stop & she didn't.\n\nInstead she escalated her nasty comments, driven by resentment about your happiness.\nShe FA & FO.\n\nYou did right to uninvite her. Enjoy a worry free special day with your soul mate!!", "NTA she must have some deep insecurities and it\u2019s a shame she wasn\u2019t able to put them aside and respect Jake and you. You don\u2019t need people like that in your life. This is a very special life event for you and her behavior seems to be spoiling it. That being said, I would have another conversation with her because she might not have realized how serious you were.", "Perhaps your relationship with Izzy has run its course. NTA. \n\nI\u2019d not invite her. Perhaps if she gave you a sincere apology I\u2019d reconsider but then I\u2019d have to have proof prior to it that she\u2019d be able to control herself. \n\nMove on, your wedding day should be drama free and celebrate the two of you. Third person truly is not wanted, and she seems to want ownership somehow. I\u2019m wondering what your fianc\u00e9 thinks about this as you have stated that he is uncomfortable.", "Nta\n\nJoking is making one or two comments. Repeating over and over is obsession.", "NTA, you asked her to stop and gave her a chance and she made her choice", "Izzy is being a jealous asshole and you are NTA.  They went on a few dates. She ended it with him, she gave you the ok and now she's acting weird and entitled. She means what she is saying and it's not a joke.  If it was initially once you and your finance both made it clear that you didn't find it funny she should have stopped.  You don't owe her an apology or to be in your wedding and she certainly doesn't need a shout out in your speeches.", "NTA, she's bitter because you found someone", "Am I wrong by saying that she is used to be the center of the attention with guys (I mean between you and her)? She sounds extremely jealous and it feels like she can't understand why you would be the one getting married first (Before her). And I'm not saying that as a judgment on you btw. Just the way she acts seems like she thinks what you are getting, she should be the one having. And more so with a guy she rejected.\n\nShe doesn't seem to be a really good friend. Is she acting like this with averything good that happens to you by any chance ? Anything you have and she doesn't, does it make her tic ?\n\nYou should reflect on her past behavior and more so on her actual behavior and decide if you really think she should have a place in your life. She sounds bitter and selfinvolved.\n\nNTA for uninviting her to your wedding. She would put a cloud on your celebrations.", "Is anyone else getting jealousy vibes from Izzy? \n\nEither way NTA and bravo for setting your boundary and sticking to it. \n\nIf Izzy apologises, the long friendship may deserve another chance, but that is your call and whether on reflection the friendship was a good one for your OP (and length does not mean it was a good one). But an apology and recognition of the seriousness of the situation from Izzy if required first.", "NTA She\u2019s not joking anymore. Time to leave her in the past. She\u2019s not a friend. She\u2019s a frenemy.", "NTA - any speech she would have given would have been about her.", " NTA.\n\nWhy is your friend being so difficult? You made a simple request.\n\nNot very supportive or friend like.\n\nI woukd take a big step back. Don't invite her. She will know why...and know it's her fault.", "NTA. She sounds like she is (1)insecure and (2) jealous that you are getting married. She makes herself feel better by telling everyone she had him first and didn\u2019t want him. By making it sound like he isn\u2019t worthy of her and all you are good for is her cast offs, she is trying to convince herself that she could have married him if she wanted. It is really kind of sad, but she just isn\u2019t getting that her behavior has crossed a line that friends don\u2019t cross.", "NTA. She is letting her jealousy get the best of her. Her comments were in very poor taste and she ignored you when you asked her to stop. If you don\u2019t want her doing the same at your wedding, she can\u2019t be there.", "NTA. There's the thing - if it is just a joke, people are able to shut up about it after you ask. Since she is not, it's something more.", "Once is a joke. You called her on it. The funny part of the joke ended right there. Anything after that is disrespect. She wants people to know she dated Jake first and that 'she let you have him' - what like she gave you her favorite blouse or something. I suspect she didn't see Jake as potential when they dated, but because you do, she is having a change of heart.\n\nYou don't need to cut her out of your life over this. You could flip it:\n\nHer: I dated Jake first, I let her have him\n\nYou: That's true and he is now all mine, I just want to thank you for sacrificing such a prize for your oldest friend. You are the best.\n\nAnd then (because I like petty) you can ask her if she would be Godmother to your children because you plan on having loads lol", "NTA, but boy would I pay good money to hear the speech she had planned.", "If you invite her your wedding would be a hot mess. She\u2019s make the entire event about her and ruin her day. She\u2019s clearly jealous of you and your happiness otherwise she wouldn\u2019t make nasty comments like she has being two faced about it being a joke. The subject matter is just tasteless and meant to be hurtful. Consider her a former long time friend. If she were a lifetime friend she\u2019d be one.", "NTA.\n\nI don't have anything to add as far as reasoning goes, but my best friend and I went through something very similar. She wasn't a huge fan of my partner, and once during an argument said she wouldn't want to come to our wedding if we ever got married. Well, we did get married, and I didn't invite her.\n\nIt's been 15+ years, and boy do I regret that decision. We were both young & stubborn, neither of us was being a fantastic friend to the other in that situation. A few years later we had a long conversation about it and reconciled, but the friendship couldn't be repaired and we never reconnected.\n\nYour relationship is obviously different, maybe this friendship is worth ending. It's a huge life moment that you cannot redo with her in it, in the event that you reconcile. In 15 years you'll all likely be different people. Could you look back and have this feel trivial in the larger scope of your friendship?  Just use caution & think deeply on this before going with the nuclear option.", "My guess is izzy is jealous, she's still single and you found the one. she wonders what she passed up and what others did she 'leg go' that having been said the fact that she kept going after you told her it made you uncomfortable makes her the AH here. if you're going to salvage the friendship the two of you need to talk. NTA", "No that's just weird af. She's clearly involved in some competition with you in her head.", "NTA\n\nOut of the two of you, your friend has the belief that she's the better one, the prettier one, the smarter one, the more desirable one.  She can't handle the fact that you successfully pulled a man that she rejected, now she's sore because people will think maybe YOU are the more desirable one after all.  Her precious ego got hurt.", "She's the pick me of the two of you, obviously, and is super jealous you found a fiance before she did, especially since she discarded the man.\n\nShe is feeling all sorts of jealousy and entitlement, and you should not invite her to your wedding.\n\nYour friend is being really pathetic.  Its sad.", "A joke one time was enough especially when you told her to back off. But no, she can\u2019t let it go and everyone at your wedding is going to hear the story of how she rejected your husband and you picked up her leftovers. No no no thanks. Friendships sometimes run their course. Like this one", "NTA - if she apologizes sincerely and says it won\u2019t happen again maybe reconsider, but she\u2019s just digging her heels in now. Some friends joke like this but a real one will respect when the other doesn\u2019t find it funny. This says it\u2019s coming from a place of weirdness. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s jealousy of him or you or what but it\u2019s the behavior and lack of accountability/remorse that\u2019s the problem.\n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your friendship.", "NTA - this being a repeated occurrence has now gotten problematic. \n\nI think a conversation would likely be best first, but I don\u2019t think uninviting should be off the table pending how that conversation goes.", "You\u2019re best friends? Men can divide friendships if both shag the same guy and the previous one doesn\u2019t get it out of her system", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t understand why people wants to date with someone who was interested in once their sibling or besties like there is no one in the world.

If there's anything you want to say to me, now yours chance\".\n\nTbh, it sounds like Izzy was the social butterfly out of the 2 of you and the one who had more dates. So this could be that she was never comfortable with you dating someone she'd dated, but said yes because she never thought it'd lead to marriage. But it's more likely to be an ego thing. She can't believe out of the two of you, you're the ones whose getting married first, and to someone she rejected.  Maybe she's done with the single life and thinking how she could have had a serious relationship, with a guy who knew early that he wanted to marry her, if she hadn't rejected him and let him move on to you.\n\nAnd instead of handling those feelings maturely, with other friends, her diary, her therapist, she's trying to get her power back by reminding everyone who Jake noticed first out of the two of you. NTA", "NTA. She feels uncomfortable with your relationship. She probably agreed to it because she saw your fiance as a guy she \"discarded\" so it probably tickled a bit her sense of superiority towards you to \"let you have him\" (she just gave me that vibe from what you described her, but I might be wrong) since she was convinced that it would not lead anywhere and you would break up eventually. But since it actually worked between you 2, she probably feels left behind or robbed of something that \"should have been hers\" (even if she's the one who didn't want him and probably still doesn't want him). In other words, she is probably jealous of you and your relationship. Maybe she is in a bad place on the relationship train right now or she simply cannot accept that you are getting married and she is not, but her behavior is simply unacceptable and you are right to cut her out of your life. That is not a friend.

Something like \u201cyou are making me and my fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable with your jokes. What is more important: that you continue to make these jokes or the longevity of our friendship? Because while you think it\u2019s a joke, what you are actually doing is trashing me and making my fianc\u00e9 feel as if you hold a candle for him and having an ex girlfriend at his wedding that pulls that sort of thing is a one way trip to no invite. He\u2019s my soul mate and I love him. And I will choose him if forced to\u201d\n\nBecause that\u2019s real. This is the man you chose. She did not. Whatever damage she\u2019s feeling is something to take to a therapist.\n\nBTW I\u2019ve had friends that pulled this kind of thing on me. Where we were friends from junior high and she was def the prettier one who got a boyfriend early and was much more experienced than I. Then I lost a ton of weight and was no longer her wing man. And then she made out with the dude I was seeing (thankfully not much was invested there) and frankly we aren\u2019t friends anymore. It\u2019s sad and I hope she is well but at the same time things weren\u2019t the same after that event. \n\nInvest in people who are happy for you and Jake and will grow with you. It leads to more contentment.", "I\u2019m sorry, but those \u201cmutual friends\u201d are not mutual. They won\u2019t listen to your side because they don\u2019t value you the same way they value Salty Sally. No sane person would look at this situation and agree with her. They\u2019re ass kissers and have chosen which one they want to hold on to. I hope you and Jake make some new ones together and have a lovely, drama free wedding\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe", "Sorry to be harsh, but everything you wrote makes it seem like Izzy thinks she's better than you.  And that she's shocked/offended that someone she dated would also be interested in you.  And that's why she keeps commenting on the fact that she dated him first.  She just has to put you down.", "Gotcha... well its not that then I guess (i.e. its not some sitcom situation where it was  Jake was actually the one that broke it off or anything like that and Izzy was lying).", "It likely wont accomplish much but if OP is worried about over thinking, she probably should reach out again.", "She's just embarrassing herself at this point. She looks petty and jealous, which will only get worse if she ruins her friendship with OP over it.", "That is so great that you let it drop even though if you introduced them with intent then yeah, you set them up. In the grand scheme of things that isn\u2019t why they are together or why they lasted, so maybe that\u2019s why she took offense, but if I wouldn\u2019t have met my husband any other way if I were her I  would have gladly thanked you.", "With modern divorce rates I'd hesitate to claim matchmaker status for any couple I'd introduced. \n\nThere were two people I knew who happened in the same room and who had never met, told them each other's names, everything that happened after is all on them!", "NTA. This is your wedding and not a public forum. When someone direspects you intentionally, just cut them off.", "You just may not have realized she saw you that way, but it seems like she did.  I had a friend from high school that I thought was supportive and a great friend.  That is until our mid-20s when I got a job at a mortgage company (previously I worked for CPA firms).  She was furious, because her dream job was to become an underwriter and she was livid that I got a job at a mortgage company (not as an underwriter, it was in an admin position and I left after a year).  I heard how she REALLY felt about me and my career choices up to that point.  It was eye opening.  And it made me look back on our friendship and realize how she was really supportive when I was struggling, but was distant and silent whenever something good happened to me.", "This. NTA, OP, uninvite her for sure", "I was very young when it happened, so Izzy was definitely more important than Jake, so I made sure. :)", "Uninvite her and spare yourself some embarrassment on your wedding day as surely her jealously will lead her to do something especially if drunk", "This is the way. Life is too short to be pandering to idiots blathering on about who had who first.\n\nEnjoy your wedding and if people decide to choose a side where there really isn't one, at least you'll know who your true friends are."]}
