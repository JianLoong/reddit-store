She sent them to school and let my aunt borrow money. She would cook and we would deliver it to their house. \nMy dad actually helped my Aunt's husband to get work in his field so that they can afford to buy their house. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs kids,\u00a0 I am happy to share anything I have with them. There are even times when I would receive less than them especially on Holidays. Or times that people forgot to give me a gift on Christmas because they have to buy gifts for my cousins first. I was told that I am lucky to have parents who can afford so I should share. I believed them and that has been the way things are growing up\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was after I moved out my city and eventually settled in my dad's home country that I felt I started to have more perspective in life and learned boundaries\n\n\n\n\n\nThis resulted to me going less and less to visit them. Though I visit at least once a month\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace is older than me (30). She announced she's getting married back in February and I congratulated her. We're close but amongst my cousins she's the one I tend to spend the least amount of time with majorly on different preferences and likes. I respect her since she's older and we had happy times together\n\n\n\n\n3 days ago she sent me a message in a half joking manner that it's her wedding soon (Dec) and she's looking for that one of a kind dress \nfor me to buy. \n\nI was stunned. Literally speechless. I just stared my phone re-reading the text over and over. Knowing her I knew she's not joking at all. \n\n\n\nFor info i read it on the notification as I can see it. It doesn't register on my message app that I've read it unless I open it. For this I was truly grateful because I didn't know what to reply. \nI've keep thinking about it, what if the dress was way too expensive, what if she won't like anything? \nI think the wedding dress is very important in any wedding and for that I will never dare to say I will pay for it \n\n\n\nThen after a few hours of not responding my aunt sent me a message nothing direct just the usual. She had messaged me at least 4 times since then but I ignored everything. The only time she would message me is that when needs something and complain how they can't afford anything) \n\n\nI feel like I don't want to do it. I hate it when people uses \"jokes\" to ask. \n\nThat's where I am for a day or two but I've made a decision to refuse. Thing is will I be the AiTA if I do this? \n\nYes I potentially do have the money but in the past 3 years I have less contact with them I feel my life to have gotten better. \nI want to cut contact but that's impossible with the family I have. \n\n\n\nAita if I say no?\u00a0 How to please help.", "created_utc": 1669201894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2mele/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_buy_my_cousin_her_wedding/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's her wedding.\n\nCan you respond in a similarly half-joking manner? Something like \"Haha, if only! What I'd give to have enough disposable income to buy your wedding dress \ud83d\ude02 Let me know when you've bought one, keen to see it!\"", "Misunderstand on purpose. \n\n\"I'm sure whatever you'll buy will be perfect. See you soon\". \n\nIf asked directly, laugh in their face. She's in her thirties, why on earth should her 24 year old cousin pay for her wedding dress? OP, you'd be insane to do this. I honestly think that they're only doing this to see if they can guilt you into things, like they did with your parents. NTA. Prepare your move and make sure it leaves a dent", "Wait what? Just confirm I've got this straight. She expects you, her younger cousin, to buy her wedding dress?\n\nWhy?\n\nThat is weird. You said you've learned about boundaries but like, have you? Because this request is so far past reasonable that it's not even funny.\n\nNTA OP. Your entire life you and your own parents have put yourself 2nd to your cousins. You need to have a conversation with your mother and father and express this. I'm very disappointed in your family.", "NTA. It\u2019s her wedding, she can buy her dress.", "NTA --- Send them a text back saying as an adult you have to pay your own way and that all your wages go to supporting your life and therefore you have no money to buy you a wedding dress, sorry if this isn't the response you were expecting but I have to pay for my life nobody else does that for me.", "NTA. Why on earth should you pay for your cousins wedding dress? That sounds absolutely absurd. I don't know if there's some cultural expectation at play here, but if that is the case, I would still absolutely refuse. We live in 2022 and people pay for their own clothes.", "NTA, it's not just about buying the dress. It's about them wanting to use you and your parents for money so they can be living life easier. And if you don't do as they \"jokingly ask\", they will use the family card on you.  Don't let that get to you. That isn't family and for your parents to keep their behaviors going, they will all turn into spoiled brats. Which is exactly where that cousin is at. She expects you pay. Your aunt expects you to pay. \nThat is not right. I know you mentioned it is difficult going no contact, but try. Block everyone without a second thought. Stop visiting. Once you go no contact, you may feel a weight off your shoulders of the burdens they placed on you as your \"family\". \nIf they keep getting a new number or try and visit you, you can get a restraining order on them that will by law, keep them away.", "NTA. You\u2019re just starting out on your own. Wedding dresses are big expenses, and it\u2019s unreasonable for them to decide on their own that you should be the one to pay. Tell them you can\u2019t and don\u2019t reply to their requests.", "NTA\n\nJust because your mother allowed her sister to lean on your family so much that there were times you didn't get while they did doesn't mean this mooch gets to do the same to you.  What a disgraceful relative.", "NTA. It\u2019s not going to stop at the wedding dress - after that she\u2019ll ask you to pay for things for the apartment, and once she starts having kids, things for them too. Please don\u2019t.", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to pay for her dress. It\u2019s ridiculous that she expects it!\n\nI know it\u2019s easier to just ignore her message, but you do need to respond and clearly put the boundary out there that you will not be paying for her dress or anything else. Make sure not to say that you are sorry that you can\u2019t, if you include that \u201cI am sorry\u201d, I feel she will grab onto that and try to emotionally manipulate you further. Simply respond with a clear message, even though it will be hard on you. And the dysfunctional family dynamic or drama your response could cause is not your problem! It is an unhealthy system and it\u2019s great you\u2019ve begun to see that and do what you need to distance yourself from that.\n\nJust respond with a clear message, \u201cI will not be paying for your dress or any of your other expenses.\u201d If she, your aunt, or anyone else harasses you after that, block them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sorry that your parents seem to have placed supporting your cousin as priority over their own child. I'd message your cousin that you will not be paying for her dress. I wouldn't give excuses as that just gives them something to argue with.  As she asked it in a joke-like way I'd be tempted to say something like \"haha good one. Seriously  though,i can't pay for your dress\" to try and soften it (assuming you still want the relationship). Tell  your aunt and parents too. You may have to mute them for abit until you feel ready to deal with the inevitable backlash. Good luck.", "NTA do not back down - use one of the replies someone has posted below to deflect or just out right stand  up for yourself. Never admit you have enough - they are not inside your brain - they cant log into your bank account - so what you get a regular salary - what if you have debts, what if you have loaned money to people, what if you are saving up to buy a home. So what you can afford it, its none of their business how much you have.\n\nIts insane that you would buy her a dress. She can delay her a wedding until she can afford it, her future husband can pay for it, her parents can contribute etc. She can buy a second hand dress, go to charity shop, wear one another family member has worn or buy something within her means or save up.\n\nThis isnt your child.", "NTA\n\nI believe if you cannot even buy your own wedding dress, marry later.", "NTA.  You are not responsible to pay for anything for her wedding.  If your parents had to pay for everything for them then they can go ask your parents to pay for it.

It took me a couple more sentences to work out that it was asking for you to buy the bridal gown, and then I had to re-read to make sure you hadn't misinterpreted a poorly phrased message asking you to be a bridesmaid. The fact that someone would ask anyone other than their parents (or someone who filled that role in some way, like an older sibling) to pay for a wedding dress, let alone someone they don't speak to very often, is bonkers. Utterly bananas. 404 concept not found.", "Yeah, OP, this one right here.\n\nBecause you've still got some serious work to do on your boundaries if you can't realize the utter ridiculousness of this dress request as soon as you saw it.\n\nNTA."]}
