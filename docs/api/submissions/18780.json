He is a firm believer in \u201conce a cheater always a cheater\u201d and says watching Katie getting married goes against his morals and he has to be true to himself.\n\nThe others are shocked but have accepted his reasoning, but Dan is very upset.

Similarly, it's your choice to call him out for it.\n\nThat said, your opinion and Josh's opinion on the matter are completely irrelevant.  This is something between Dan and Katie, and is really none of your business.  It's not for either of you to judge.\n\nIn the end, though, it sounds to me like Josh is the asshole here.  Ultimately, he's blaming Katie for not living up to vows that she hadn't yet taken when the cheating happened, and using that as an excuse to turn his back on a so-called \"good friend.\"  That's just garbage behaviour.", "YTA- this is none of your business.", "yta but only for getting involved and telling him he is out of line for rsvping no.  a wedding invitation is not a summons.  however if josh were smart about it when he said no not attending he should have just said sorry im away or soemthing else came up to deflect from further drama", "NTA - What goes on in *THEIR* relationship is between *THEM*, not you and not Josh.  He's going to lose a friend eventually with this attitude.", "Um.   Going with NAH although I\u2019m not 100 percent on that.  Josh is absolutely allowed to have his own morals and not attend a wedding he doesn\u2019t support.  I\u2019m not entirely sure though why he\u2019s choosing now to make his opinion known since the cheating seemed to happen years ago and the couple seemed to work through things. He seems to be judging their relationship by what happened 8 years ago and not what they\u2019ve been building since then.  He does seem like a judgemental AH but again he\u2019s allowed his opinion and feelings. As for you, yes it\u2019s not your business but as long as you just reached out once to try to talk to him civilly to attempt to change his mind is ok.  As many people say on this sub say, it\u2019s ok to ask but not ok to not accept the answer.  He gave you his answer and you need to accept or whether you agree or disagree. \nIf you keep pushing this it would change the judgement.

It feels so controlling and just, I don't know man. It's not his relationship and the couple in question took steps to feel comfortable moving forward together. It was also 8 years ago and had no real impact on Josh.   \n\n\nI just... Josh needs to get a life of his own. NTA", "NTA It isn't Josh's place to approve or disapprove of the bride. His grudge towards her is due to the fact that she made Dan suffer once and to his prejudice that she'll do it again. Dan knows Katie and accepted the risk with his eyes opened, so Josh is plainly disrespecting his friend's judgement. \n\nYou just made an attempt  at talking Josh out of destroying his friendship with Dan, for everyone's sake.

Just at the begining of a long term? If I were one of Dan's friends I would practically scream they are other girls out there. Let this one go.

OP then passed judgement on Josh.  What goes around comes around.\n\nFrom what I understand, OP is calling out Josh on his opinion.  He isn't making Josh attend the wedding, just expressing his opinion that Josh's reasoning is bullshit.  If Josh can claim that the reason for the wedding is bullshit because of the cheating, then OP is every bit as justified in his opinion.", "100% about Josh. Coming at him so strong is theAH move. Maybe he has some good reasons. If not... it's still his reasons", "Your reply implies that everyone else is entitled to Josh's presence.  They aren't; that's his decision to make.  He's not stopping the wedding or anyone else from attending.  That's on him alone; it's his moral decision to make.  OP though is acting as if it's his/her business what Josh does; OP has no moral decision to make, unless Josh tries to dissuade others from attending or counterprograms with an event of his own."]}
