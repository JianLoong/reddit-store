He is a firm believer in \u201conce a cheater always a cheater\u201d and says watching Katie getting married goes against his morals and he has to be true to himself.\n\nThe others are shocked but have accepted his reasoning, but Dan is very upset.

I am a bit worried if AITA for not respecting Josh\u2019s morals and getting involved?\n\n**EDIT: Thanks a lot for the reflected feedback, especially the comments calling me out on MMOB.

It will break the friendship but that's Josh being true to his morals.  He isn't judging people based on who they are, how they were born, or what lifestyle they had.  He's judging someone off the decisions they made and the displayed content of their character.  That's not wrong.  \n\nSo you need to back TF up.   \n\nTheir friendship is likely over, but that's still due to the bride's cheating.

Josh was not the wronged party in this situation, and has no right to attempt to \"hold her responsible\" for a wrong that he was not party to.

But I still stood there and let it happen, because they are all adults, so not my monkey, not my circus. Dad and SM have been married roughly 5 years now, and they are \"fine\" but honestly the most boring couple I know. He still saw other woman a few times after the wedding until she finally cut him off. She got married herself last year and unfortunately passed away back in December. \n\nMy entire point here being, Josh my have a point. Sometimes cheaters are always cheaters. Sometimes they aren't. Sometimes people make a stupid mistake, and it actually never happens again. It all depends on the person. But it's not for you or your other friends to day ir get involved in.

And no just because you cheat on your boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean you will cheat on your husband.", "I would struggle to watch 2 people get hitched when I know, despite them talking things through and making up, that one cheated/ hit the other/ had a history of cheating or assault on a partner in the past too tbh.", "It isn\u2019t yours either yet here you are, she\u2019s allowed to give her friend her points of view And she\u2019s entitled to disagree with his choice", "How is giving somebody a different perspective and asking them to reconsider voicing them she didn\u2019t put a gun to their head sure he has a right to feel whatever way he chooses, but pointing out the dismay end a friendship is OK. It\u2019s not forcing somebody to attend.", "He's not policing anyone though? He's just saying he's not attending a wedding he doesn't support. He's not trying to make anyone act according to his standards only explaining the standards he lives by won't allow him to support a union he sees as a farce.", "How is telling your friend your point of view into reconsidering a choice on the end of very good friendship, harassment, and it actually is kind of her business since he announced it to the whole friend group not like he did in private, but you will do you I know if I\u2019m making a potential life altering mistake based on My frame of thinking that I may not have considered other points of view, that one of my good friends be a shining lite of reason and point out the other perspective I may not have considered", "I mean this is a really, really long grudge. If the bride and groom have had 8  years to work on their relationship, I think that's a long enough time for them to think about getting married. B & G have also had 8 years to mature, and over that long a time if people don't change in some ways, well, they're really stuck. \n\nJosh sounds a bit priggish to me, but he's really only an AH for putting it in a group chat. If he messaged the groom privately to say \"your marriage goes against my morals\", well he'd still be an AH but much less of one. \n\nAnd why do I get the feeling if the marriage DIDN'T work out for whatever reason, Josh would be there to do the Cartman Nyah Nyah song and dance - also in public. \n\nThis friendship is done however.", "Seriously, it\u2019s so messed up for Josh to be drudging this up 8 years later and causing people grief over it. I mean he\u2019s entitled to his morals, but bringing this issue back up and to the forefront of the whole group when the couple has moved past it is so shitty. Make up an excuse and stay home if you really can\u2019t get past this issue. Don\u2019t try to take some sort of stance in something the couple has moved on from.", "I feel like that comment is directed to OP more than myself, and yeah the edit does change context a fair bit. But I posted this after the edit was already there, and i'd personally argue that it would still be reasonable to privately message someone if I knew that they weren't supporting their friend at a wedding due to their own hang-ups surrounding something the couple already resolved in 2015", "This is the way.", "I think you aren\u2019t giving enough props to plants.  They are generally healthier and more robust as they age.", "serial cheating, yes", "I still think Josh is probably banging Katie and can\u2019t stand there pretending he\u2019s not banging her. Also I have no evidence of this I\u2019m just bored making stuff up.", "Still not his choice.", "No, cheating in general. If you don't believe cheating is abuse you're a cheating apologist. As someone who has been cheated on, it fucking sucks and its one of the worst most miserable feelings in the entire world.\n\nIf you cheat on someone, you are abusing them", "So as long as I only beat my partner once it\u2019s not abuse. Got it", "Aah you\u2019re right.", "Yes. I need plants to give serious visuals when they need something. Otherwise\u2026 compost anyone?", "Okay", "Thanks, man. I had no idea. Bless you for pointing that out.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a asshole move to call your friend out when they are being a jerk. Go or don\u2019t go, but sending a long winded explanation to a group chat is shitty. Also, expecting to stay friends with someone after this is dumb. \n\nIf them getting back together was such a moral issue why be friends with him this whole time?", "Sorry but IMO friends are meant to tell you the truth and even check you if necessary. \n\nI wonder if there was infidelity in Josh's life that he's pushing onto Dan's situation bc his ultimate goal should be to see Dan happy.", "People make Poor choices in life doesn\u2019t make him a bad person for the rest of it. As long as they learn bro accept and acknowledge the airport choice and change their behavior just because she did it once doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna happen again if she hid it lied about it and didn\u2019t own up to it. That\u2019s one thing but she didn\u2019t. He chose to continue on with her. That\u2019s his choice. We all make mistakes we\u2019re only human . doesn\u2019t mean You shouldn\u2019t be judged for your past mistakes for the rest of your life especially if you\u2019re no longer that person . She was held accountable for her actions. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s place to judge let he without sin be the first to condemn. Unless he\u2019s a perfect send, and never made any mistakes in his life, he has no place to point out at someone else\u2019s mistakes glass houses and stones don\u2019t mix", "it was 8 years ago though. i don\u2019t really think that\u2019s valid anymore, a lot of change happens", "I feel like since I\u2019m commenting here you are including me in this statement and calling me a teen and this is harassment and bullying and I will report you. JK but hard agree", "I just saw someone claim harassment because someone responded to two of their comments \u2026 on this post.. on the internet.", "Its 100% valid. It could have been 30 years ago. She still would have cheated.", "There's no excuse for cheating.", "_i\u2019m_ not the same person i was 8 years ago. do you think that people don\u2019t change?", "From what I understood is the friend isn\u2019t attached it\u2019s the friends boyfriend Who is attached", "I'm not the same person I was 8 years ago either. I've never once cheated on someone though. Cheating on your partner is one of the lowest things you can do to someone in a relationship. \n\nIf you beat your partner 8 years ago but changed, do you deserve a second chance?", "Because its 8 years ago?? They have clearly worked their relationship out for themselves. If Josh had a concern then couldn't he state it at a much earlier date? Like say, when they were getting back together? She made a mistake, she shouldn't have to have her whole life ruined because of it. Clearly, she repented and has a good relationship now. Its absolutely not his business to bring it up after 8 long years, in a group chat. His reasons should have been mentioned privately to the bride and groom.", "People caring about what other people do is different to what other people do being their business.", "it\u2019s not just \u201ca mistake.\u201d That\u2019s not an accident lol. That says something about the kind of person you are. She\u2019s already said that she doesn\u2019t care about his feelings, I wouldn\u2019t trust her either lol. And I\u2019m sure Josh said things when they were getting back together lol, this 100% isn\u2019t a sudden thing", "how exactly is it different?", "Doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an asshole when you do it though", "And that also says a lot about the kind of person you are, lol. I guess you never did anything wrong in your life ever, lol, and hence you think that Katie should not get a second chance. Who doesn't care about whose feelings? If you are talking about OP, who wrote this post, she just expressed her point of view after her friend expressed his in a group chat. And its been 8 years. Get off your high horse, lol. What are you tring to say? That Katie should be barred from human society for the rest of her life? Yes, she cheated. She also obviously repented of it and repaired her relationship. What else is she supposed to do here? OP is right. Its not the bride's job to go around apologising to everyone. She's already made it up to the one person whose opinion truly matters, her fiance.", "Something being someone\u2019s business means that they have a right to know about it and that it completely concerns them. People can care about things that don\u2019t concern them and thing that they don\u2019t actually have a right to know about. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that, necessarily but that\u2019s what the difference is.", "doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be an asshole abt it either lol\nI\u2019d say the greater asshole in this situation is the cheater lol", "Firstly, it\u2019s not about apologizing. Sometimes you do shit so bad that people are just going to see you differently, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. He wasn\u2019t saying they should call off the marriage, he was just saying he wouldn\u2019t be able to see that.\n\nand yes, I\u2019ve made mistakes in my life, but cheating isn\u2019t just a \u201cmistake\u201d lol. I\u2019ve never cheated. It\u2019s super easy not to cheat, bc I care about the people I say I care about. Like,, was not having sex with anyone else really *that* difficult\u2026.? She didn\u2019t care about her partner, or hurting him, and idk why I\u2019d trust that that would change.", "Imo bringing up the \u201cright\u201d to do something is weird here lol. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s saying they have a right to know about something? no one has a right to know about anything lol, they just do?", "Maybe 8 years ago she was the asshole. But if you relish publicly being a huge dick to your friend about his choice in partners because of something said partner did almost a decade ago (that the couple has mutually moved on from) I'd say you're actually not that good of a person or friend.", "As I said, I bring up the right to do something because that\u2019s what the definition of someone\u2019s business is. Like for example, a regular guest doesn\u2019t technically have the right to know what the arrangement is with the bridal party\u2019s clothes. In other words, it\u2019s none of the regular guest\u2019s business. That doesn\u2019t obviously mean there\u2019s anything wrong with the normal guest knowing, it just means it\u2019s technically not their business.  \n\nDoes it make sense now?"]}
