He has no right to disregard your achievements like that.", "NTA. Not sure where the punchline is in that joke. From what you described, it sounds like you two either need counseling or a divorce from the lack of mutual respect", "It wasn't a joke to you. It was not only cruel but completely disrespectful and dismissive of you. You have every right to be proud of your degree and feel pride every time you see or think about your Testamur and the work you put in to earn that degree. NTA but he is.", "NTA There's no joke here. Just a man intentionally misleading his partner so as to have fun at her expense. Poking fun at your university for not being good enough is disrespectful. Whether your reaction was an overreaction, I can't say. Seems like it might not be. Maybe ask yourself if a friend was being treated like you are, would you counsel her to leave?", "NTA - sometimes things are important to us, even if they are just 'pieces of paper'. He doubled down on the joke even as it was clear you were upset and not taking it as a fun joke. Does he have a history of disrespecting your things or your interests or your feelings? Is this a culmination of a thousand little 'jokes' that only he finds funny but hurt you or inconvenience you?\n\nI'd advise sitting him down and firmly stating boundaries around his jokes and what he is no longer allowed to do to you for his amusement rather than trying to move past this or leaving. Because you saying you'd leave him isn't coming out of nowhere, it likely is you reaching a boiling point of frustration over his actions towards you", "NTA - what kind of a$$hole thinks it's funny to do that? When did he think that being cruel and vicious would be considered funny. Time to go to counseling before he totally destroys whatever trust and respect you have for him. Also think back, is this the first time he's done something like this?", "NTA You could have handled the situation better, but I understand because he\u2019s repeatedly belittled your achievement. Him poking fun at your school isn\u2019t okay unless you\u2019re in on joke. You husband sounds kind of like a bully, I don\u2019t think divorce is unreasonable if he doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NTA what was he pursuing by telling you this, if it was not true? \n\nYes, bringing up leaving him is an escalation and an emotional manipulation tactic if you were not seriously considering it... But I think you should. \n\nHe constantly makes fun of an achievement that means a lot to you, and now apparently think it's entertaining to toy with your emotions with bullshit about throwing your certificate away. \n\nI won't judge without more details, but those actions are way too close to being emotional abuse.", "NTA. What kind of spouse thinks that\u2019s a funny joke? He obviously wanted to upset you, and now acts aggrieved because it worked. He sounds like an asshole who fundamentally doesn\u2019t respect you or your values or what you care about, and this interaction speaks to much deeper issues between you.", "NTA. Jokes are supposed to be funny. This \u201cjoke\u201d was intended to cause you panic and to get you upset. And now that you\u2019re upset (which don\u2019t forget, was the goal) he\u2019s mad at you?? Add in the other \u201cjokes\u201d about your university and the \u201cfuck you\u201d this would be a dealbreaker for me. Partners are supposed to be your biggest fans and should be the first to encourage and uplift you. For some reason your husband wants to make you feel badly about your accomplishments.", "NTA, dump that dickbag", "NTA. My degree is useless, (English literature lol) but I\u2019m still proud of it also. And my school was also a College that turned University after I left. I worked my ass off for that degree and I\u2019d be beyond furious if my bf joked about throwing it away.", "Any time a husband says fuck you when he is in the wrong, is the time to call a divorce attorney.", "NTA. He thought he was being funny? Tell him the part where you told him you\u2019d leave him was obviously just a joke, and he should lighten up.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is taunting you over something that you should be proud of just to ... to what? Pick a fight? Hurt your feelings? Take you down a peg or two? So he finally gets a reaction out of you and b/c it was you asserting yourself, he's going to say \"FU\" and give the silent treatment? He has taken this entirely too far. He should have not done it in the first place but then the next off ramp was to apologize once he realized how hurtful it was. He's trying to make you the bad guy but don't fall for it.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t bring up leaving him until after you found out it was his bad idea of a joke (we\u2019re all human, and it\u2019s unreasonable to ask someone to react 100% gracefully to a malicious joke from a loved one who made them a punchline). If it had really been accident (and he was appropriately apologetic) you likely would\u2019ve had a different reaction. It looks like this is a continuation of him poking fun at your degree. You should lock up your degree (if he crossed this boundary once he may decide to be a \u201ccomedian\u201d again), along with any important papers you have. Remember that your reaction matched the level of disrespect he dealt to you and your achievements. Be careful when you talk about this with him, and make sure you have an alternative place to spend the night if things get too heated. Good luck", "NTA\n\n>I know I took it too far to bring up leaving\n\nYou didn't.", "ESH you both are immature, especially in the way you've handled it since. I can't imagine not resolving things after a blow-up and just prolonging the misery.", "ESH \n\nIt was a shitty joke and he was shitty about your feelings afterwards. It wasn't funny and he should have just apologized. \n\nThe degree is replaceable. You clearly don't care about it since it's just laying around. Take care of your shit.", "If you\u2019re proud of your degree YOU need to be responsible for it and keep it in ONE place where you know where it is. I\u2019d NEVER leave my X-ray license lying around in a pile to get thrown away. It\u2019s always in the same file folder in my important file box. YTA.", "ESH - you both sound immature. Your husband shouldn\u2019t have doubled down on his ridiculous joke (make your little joke, DH, then say, \u201cnah, just kidding. I\u2019d never do that\u201d) when he has a history of poking fun at your achievement.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s a freaking piece of paper. I once accidentally threw my MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE away. Didn\u2019t realize it. Just grabbed the wrong stack of papers for the trash, and we didn\u2019t notice until a month later. My husband didn\u2019t threaten to leave me over it.

That's just disrespectful.\"\n\n\nYou would leave him over an accident?  Lort.  I hope he is 10/10 perfect as there's no margin for error here.\n\nYTA", "ESH He sucks for this unfunny, disrespectful \u201cjoke\u201d and his parting comment of f-you. You for threatening to leave if it wasn\u2019t really a joke. In the first place, practical jokes are only funny to those pulling them or not affected by them. Secondly, tossing out a threat of leaving/divorce that casually is very telling about the true state of your relationship. Third and final, accidents happen and, according to your post, he said he might have accidentally gathered your diploma up with other papers and destroyed it. If your diploma means that much that you\u2019re willing to walk away from your marriage over it accidentally being thrown out, then you should take the time to frame it properly.", "YTA. It's understandable that you're proud of your degree and that it means a lot to you, but the way you reacted to your husband's \"joke\" was completely out of line. Instead of simply telling him that it wasn't funny and that you were hurt by it, you threatened to leave him and then stormed off. This kind of behavior is not acceptable and it's no wonder that your husband reacted the way he did.
