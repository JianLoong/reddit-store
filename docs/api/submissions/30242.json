My employers have withheld that information from most of their employees. it\u2019s only the employees who are \u201cin-the-know\u201d or favored by management that know about sickleave & PTO. \nOne of my coworkers let it slip in front of me that he\u2019s only got seven PTO days left and I looked confused . And then they (being the other coworkers were around us) started, looking concerned and stuttering over their words, trying to explain how I would receive PTO if I was eligible for it in the first place. They said that you have to work 35 hours a week in order to qualify for PTO.. I work 40 hours a week plus overtime.. every vacation I took I simply took a pay cut. No one told me that I could use a PTO day. Every time I was sick in the last three years, I simply took a day of no pay because no one told me I had sick days to use.  So now that I found out exactly how much PTO and sick days I do have a wrong for wanting to use them all.?? Especially because it\u2019s been three years and no one told me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: we\u2019re a family owned business, there is no technical HR. I never received an employee handbook or a copy of my contract. I did IN FACT read it over (3  YEARS AGO) before I signed it. Again never mentioned anything about this.

Do you complete a timesheet?  Or how are your hours passed to payroll?  Payroll should know the rules about PTO and automatically apply them to your pay if you qualify.  If they haven\u2019t been processing it correctly, they should fix it.", "NTA. This is shady and may be illegal. Get a clear answer from HR about what the PTO and sick policy is, and find out how much PTO you have and if you can be paid out for the days you should have been able to take PTO. Do it over email if you can, otherwise take careful notes. If you aren't satisfied, see if you can get a free consult with a labor lawyer, or call a legal aid help line. Sometimes all it takes is a scary letter on legal stationery to get action.", "NTA. You should look into it asap. See if you have to use the time before the end of the year, or if it rolls over into the next year. You dont want to lose what you accumulated all year & have to start all over... Thats super sketchy. It should have been in your onboarding paperwork, your employee handbook. You should look into what else theyre not forthcoming with you about.", "NTA. If they don't have a rule against that, why wouldn't you do that?

It wasn\u2019t noted in your employment contract, you don\u2019t have any sort of employee handbook with company policies anywhere? If you\u2019re in the US, if you earn pto based on your hours, it all pays out when you separate anyway, so they would end up paying you out for eventually-there\u2019s no benefit to withholding that information. If you are granted pto, that absolutely would have been part of your compensation information that you would have had to sign when you were hired. I don\u2019t understand how you could possibly be unaware of this.", "This sounds very weird. The company gives PTO for vacation time as a benefit to either refresh their employees minds (all work and no play makes for a dull employee) and/or as an incentive to prevent turn over. It's to the company's advantage that employees know that they have PTO. \n\nIf your source of information is currently only word of mouth, check with HR to make sure that you do receive the PTO benefit and then do your thing.\n\nNTA - The company gives these benefits for its own advantage, no foul in taking it.

Use them all. That\u2019s what they are there for.", "NTA. How did you not know about this earlier? Did you not receive an employee handbook or benefits information when you started? This is an HR issue, and you need to talk to them about this information being withheld from employees. If you are in the US, your state may have rules around PTO. Also, I would start looking for a different job, because this company sounds sketchy.", "NTA. Depending on where you live, it may be illegal for your employee to not be making you aware of the benefits you receive. I\u2019d be calling a labor lawyer to see if you\u2019re owed compensation for the days you\u2019ve taken off without pay.", "DEFINITELY NTA. If anything, your employer ITA. Take as much as possible. Also, tell every single employee about it. Let everyone know they have benefits they may be missing out on. Few things get me more heated than abuse of workers and withholding of benefits. You\u2019re all being taken advantage of and should retaliate", "NTA \n\nGet a lawyer involved NOW. Most of that stuff is use or lose\u2026. You should be worried about how much money you\u2019ve LOST, not how much you have left. \n\nGet a lawyer IMMEDIATELY. Don\u2019t do anything until you do.
