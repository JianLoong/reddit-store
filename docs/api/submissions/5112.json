We had originally stated that we would try to keep this as brief and shelter our daughter from this harsh time as much as possible. \n\nLately she has been very hateful and disrespectful towards me and for the longest I couldn\u2019t understand why, Until she had gotten into a fit and told me that I ruined her life and if I just kept my legs closed she would have still had her family back together, \n\nThis shocked me, at first I was pissed but then I was confused as to where she got this information from. \n\nI had asked her before and she said that she wasn\u2019t going to talk to me when I was the one who ruined her life. \n\nI called her father and asked him if he knew anything about this and if he had told anyone I was the one who fucked up but he dismissed everything and said he had no clue where she had gotten that information from. \n\nNow I was really confused and back to angry that she said this to me, but I chose to wait until I knew what was going on \nI tried talking to her multiple times but she continued to shut me down and say that I ruined her life, I\u2019m a terrible mom, I chose sex above her family, and I\u2019m the only one to blame for her not having a mom and dad together.\n\nI reached out to all family and friends to see if they had said anything that would lead to this as well.\n\nNow I\u2019m not proud if this but I saw a message come up on my daughters phone and I peaked at it, the message read, \u201cI know sweetie just three more days\u201d and it was from her dad. I opened the phone to see tons of messages of them two going back and forth with her telling him that she was sick of being here, she didn\u2019t want to be near me after I did that, she couldn\u2019t believe I would cheat, she\u2019s disgusted by Me, and her father just agreed and consoled her. \n\nI\u2019d asked him multiple times if he knew anything about her behavior and he said no, he put the blame on me for no reason. \n\nI called him once again after that, and messaged him about it when he didn\u2019t respond and got left on read.\n\nI sat my daughter down and told her that I know she\u2019s angry at me, and I tried to shelter her from this and keep her ad far away from this as possible, but I won\u2019t be held accountable for actions that weren\u2019t mine. I left any and all questions that i couldn\u2019t say without his perspective out.\n\nShe was shocked and apologized for her behavior to me. This wasn\u2019t some petty revenge to get back at him, but I cant have my relationship with hers ruined either.\nI\u2019m now getting blasted by all of my family and his for doing this so AITA\n\nEdit: to anyone and everyone reading this, do not take that I divorced because of his sexuality, nor did I say what I did for the malicious intent behind it. I respected him before this and I still respected him now and left any questions I couldn\u2019t fully answer to her so nothing was left misunderstood.", "created_utc": 1671454706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpqwfz/aita_for_telling_my_kid_the_real_reason_me_and/", "score": 8235, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless her child is openly homophobic then there is quite literally no reason for her to hide his sexuality when discussing something that he did that ruined his child's life. When you make the choice to fuck people over they are under no obligation to keep your secrets, especially if it poses no danger to you. It does not make her an asshole. It means she's an open and honest person and shows that daddy dearest is manipulative as fuck. \nHe cheated, he ruined her life, he then tried to manipulate her and flip the script.

We spilt the bills, make major decisions about the house together, etc. \nWell when my brother moved out of his house he moved in with me and my mom. I wasn\u2019t consulted. I was just expected by everyone, including my other siblings to just be okay with it and deal with it because \u201cwe had the room\u201d. \nBackstory: a year before my brother moved in my older sister moved in. She was in the end stages of life fighting stage 4 ovarian cancer. My mom and I were her main caregivers. During that time I\u2019ll admit that I wasn\u2019t invested in my other siblings lives. How could I be? I was taking care of my eldest sister, just watching her slowly fade away?\nShe passed on May 8/2021. My brother started coming around telling me how bad his marriage was, and the his wife was the worst person. That she was the reason he couldn\u2019t come around and help with my sister, etc. She cheated on him, abused him, etc. Naturally I was pissed. His wife was one of my best friends. \n\u2026\nWhen they finally separated I put everything I knew about their separation aside in order to make sure their son, my nephew was okay. He had just turned 17, and was in his senior year in high school. I wanted to make sure his life was as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible. However(and I\u2019m not proud of this), whenever my nephew would tell me things that his dad had done I wouldn\u2019t believe him. I thought it was his mom manipulating him. \nWell about three months into my brother living with me I had already had enough of his behavior. He would come home drunk, yell at me, yell at my dog, yell at my mom, leave his shit everywhere, in and out of the house all-night long, leave the front door unlocked at all hours of the night, etc. \nI started asking my mom how long we were going to put up with him, and allow him to stay in our house rent free, eating our food without helping pay for it, etc. She would tell me she wasn\u2019t going to kick him out. He was going through enough. \nAs the year progressed his behavior got worse. I told my mom he was on something other than alcohol and pot. That he wasn\u2019t acting like someone who was only drinking and smoking. I also told her that he shouldn\u2019t be out of money all the time borrowing from her if he was always working, and he made over $100,000 a year. That it didn\u2019t make sense. \nThe last weekend in May of this year my mom and I were out of town on separate trips.\nWell May 30/2022 I came home from my weekend away to find that my brother had his girlfriend and her two kids IN MY HOUSE without mine or my mom\u2019s permission. They had stayed there for the weekend. One of her kids actually slept in my room. I was PISSED. It was the last straw. Not only did he bring his girlfriend and her kids to stay at our house, he had her 7 year old son staying in ky room. My room is off limits even to my nephews and nieces because I am on medications that if taken by a child or overdosed on could k*ll someone. I have an autoimmune disease. I am on all sorts of stuff including n*rcotics. I try to keep things up and locked away, but there is always a chance I forget to put something up.\nI called a friend to tell her how angry I was, and my brother overheard me. He started yelling at me telling me that he could have anyone at the house he wanted to because it was HIS house. I matched his energy which he was not used to. He was used to everyone backing down and cowering. Well not this time. My mom wasn\u2019t here to intervene, and I had had enough of his BS. I told him that unless he helped pay the bills he was a guest in this house. I told him to stop playing \u201cdad\u201d to kids that weren\u2019t his, and to go be a dad to his son(I know I shouldn\u2019t have gone there, and I have since apologized for that). \nHe said he was moving out. I told him good it was about time. \nI think he thought that once my mom got home he would be able to come back and bring his girlfriend and her kids with him. He actually tried a few times. But my mom always told him that he was welcome back but his girlfriend and her kids were not. \nWell the last weekend in June my mom and I went to Wyoming to visit one of my sisters. I had my nephew(brothers son), and a niece stay at the house to make sure nothing happened, and to watch my dog. \nWe left on a Wednesday. That Friday my niece called her mom who we were visiting to tell her that she couldn\u2019t take my brother and his girlfriend and her kids anymore, and she didn\u2019t know why \u201cgramma and aunt Rachel let them stay the weekend at the house\u201d. \nCome to find out my brother had lied to my niece telling her that we said if she was cool with it we said they could stay at the house that weekend(we did not). He said the same thing to his son.\nWhen we returned on Sunday my brother was gone, the house was a wreck, my dog was traumatized, and I put my foot down. I told my mom that under no circumstances will I ever be okay with my brother moving back in or even staying one night. \nBy the end of July we finally found out that him and his girlfriend had been addicted to fent@nyl, and that he had also been paying her bills. That he had \u201cborrowed\u201d close to $100,000 from family and friends of my dads(who passed away in 2017 from cancer). He went to rehab and left four days later. My mom started letting him stay in the house again. I told her if she continued to let him stay at our house I was going to move out. She told me she wouldn\u2019t close the door to him. So I made the decision to move. I\u2019m moving to Texas in January. \nAbout a month ago I decided that I wanted to apologize to his ex(my SIL) for not listening to her. So I contacted her son(brothers stepson), and asked him if he would ask her if she would be willing to talk. We met up and talked. Come to find out my brother has been addicted to dr*gs for years. She was just able to keep it together enough to make everything look normal. He cheated on her, and gave her an STD. And so many other things(I\u2019ve seen emails, paperwork, etc). \nI haven\u2019t talked to him in over a month, and I have a relationship with my SIL again. \nI told my younger sister that SIL and I had talked. Younger sister was pissed at me and told me that my loyalty is with our brother. I told her that he lost my loyalty by emotionally, verbally, and mentally abusing me and my mom the year he lived with us. By threatening to k*ll my dog, by stealing my medications(I\u2019m a chronic pain patient b/c of an autoimmune disease), stealing money from me and my mom, lying to everyone about where the money he is \u201cborrowing\u201d is going, etc, \nI told her the only ones from his family who has my loyalty are my nephews(his son and stepson).", "It's a lesson for all.

I agree that being manipulative, and cheating doesn't give the child a framework of how a healthy relationships should work. That part is not fair to the child.

I choose to separate his skills as a parent from his skills as a father. I choose to say his relationships are none of my business until the girl is personally involved in our lives, because that's his life, not mine, and he respects my wishes by not bringing her around when I ask him not to.\n \nDon't get me wrong, I can't defend the cheating, and I will still tell my dad he's a hoe. I hated him for years for what he did and I never believed a word of what he said in regard to cheating, but it doesn't take away the impact of what it meant for him to be my dad. My mom wasn't there (even before my dad cheated). She was emotionally unavailable (again, before my dad cheated). Frankly, my dad should've ended it with her before he cheated because she wasn't a good partner, but he chose to cheat instead.\n\nMy dad was there for me. He's a great father but a horrible partner. The difference between OP and my parents is my mom refuses to take any responsibility for any wrongdoing on her part (not just in their relationship but with her kids too), maybe both of my parents were horrible. I wouldn't say my dad deserved \"dad of the year;\" he still needs work, but dad's like him don't deserve to be berated and told that they're a bad parent despite their attempts and the other things they do to be there and actually support and take care their kids, especially if they're still supporting the mother without undermining her, while taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nWe can have a difference of opinion but I felt it was better for my family to compartmentalize and give my kid the opportunity to see the good in her father without tarnishing his image in her eyes, despite everything he did to me.

It is what it is.", ">sorry, but I HATE when people try to play the \"but it doesn't mean they were a bad parent!\" Bs card. It DOES. A good parent doesn't cheat on their partner and rip the family apart over a selfish decision/urge. A good parent doesn't lie and manipulate to get their way over the wellbeing of their children/spouse.

Unless it's literally the only asterisk you use, it's going to just make stuff seem to \"randomly\" jump from italics to normal text.

My own malignant narcissist supposedly had prostate cancer, but the \"treatments\" he described don't actually exist, nor was there a doctor by the name of the one he claimed was treating him at our hospital. \n\nMy son and I had to escape him in the literal middle of the night when he was throwing furniture at us and threatening to shoot our pets. And we had a judge who said that men his size are gentle giants and turned down a restraining order. \n\nYears later, after court mandated visitation gave him the opportunity to torture my child, we finally did get that order of protection, but nearly all the mutual friends thought I was the psycho broad who stole the great guy's kid for no reason. A couple saw through him, though --", "I am still ashamed and don't think I've ever openly admitted that at least a small part of why I didn't leave is because I didn't want to have to admit to my abusive parent that they may have been right. I hid the abuse because if she'd have known she'd have made absolutely sure I knew just how right she was, and just how stupid I was. Domestic violence is so complicated, \"Why didn't you leave sooner?\" is never a kind or concerned question. It's a judgement.", "yes, exactly this. betraying the child's other parent, even if they haven't betrayed the child directly, has detrimental effects on the mindstate of the other parent and therefore indirectly detriments the child.", "I\u2019m reading a book rn called Codependent No More.

Sadly until you are actually out of the situation it is very hard to see how to get yourself away safely (especially with kids involved). I had an abusive ex and I swear he was far more dangerous than I even got to see because I was presented with a way to run and I took it. He still followed me to other countries to start with though. He contacted me many years later via social media to ask me how I was and I saw the exact same patterns in his behaviour and messages and even though I was in a different country from him it still put chills down my spine.", "I agree. OP divorced that ex not because of his sexuality. They divorced the ex because ex chose to cheat", "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through all that, but I\u2019m glad you are getting away.

A guy I met at uni and became good friends with kept talking about his ex (it was an on-and-off relationship, they kept getting back together) in a bad light and told us - a group of girls - a sob story how she cheated on him twice and he forgave her but she still didn't respect him enough; and all his previous friends turned out to be fake and left him. We had no reason not to, so we believed him, consoled him and moved on. Goodhearted people are often taken advantage of, so that could've been the case. \n\n\n\n\nBarely two months in he showed his true colours, he was completely self absorbed and depending on his mood we were either good friends or all fake that wouldn't help him when he was down (lies, he forcibly refused our help and then was mad we respected his boundaries), he thought he was the only altruistic person left. Soon I realised, well I've never heard the other side of his sob stories \u2014 maybe his \"fake friends\" were normal people like us that dropped him after getting tired of being mistreated. Same with his girlfriend, we only heard *his* side of the story and after he revealed his true self, I stopped believing whatever he had told us about her. \n\n\n\nAbout a year later he begrudgingly got into another relationship (with an innocent girl that was really infatuated with him, even though we'd taken her aside and warned her about him) and treated her like crap, worse than he would've treated a maid, he was never physically violent but the toxicity of his words and actions was over 9000. Thankfully she broke up with him (ensue another sob story of how he tried to mend his mistakes of the past but she wouldn't give him a chance to) but imho? Right now I couldn't care less if his first gf had really cheated on him or not, the way he behaves is far worse.", "Telling your kid their mother cheated when they didn't makes you a bad parent....lol tf", "I've been a target parent (I had my daughter all week long, her dad had every weekend). OP needs to take this very seriously. \n\nI will say, some courts DO NOT take it seriously which is why it's important to get on top of this and nip it in the bud before the parent/child relationship is undermined too far.
