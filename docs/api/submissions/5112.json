We had originally stated that we would try to keep this as brief and shelter our daughter from this harsh time as much as possible. \n\nLately she has been very hateful and disrespectful towards me and for the longest I couldn\u2019t understand why, Until she had gotten into a fit and told me that I ruined her life and if I just kept my legs closed she would have still had her family back together, \n\nThis shocked me, at first I was pissed but then I was confused as to where she got this information from. \n\nI had asked her before and she said that she wasn\u2019t going to talk to me when I was the one who ruined her life. \n\nI called her father and asked him if he knew anything about this and if he had told anyone I was the one who fucked up but he dismissed everything and said he had no clue where she had gotten that information from. \n\nNow I was really confused and back to angry that she said this to me, but I chose to wait until I knew what was going on \nI tried talking to her multiple times but she continued to shut me down and say that I ruined her life, I\u2019m a terrible mom, I chose sex above her family, and I\u2019m the only one to blame for her not having a mom and dad together.\n\nI reached out to all family and friends to see if they had said anything that would lead to this as well.\n\nNow I\u2019m not proud if this but I saw a message come up on my daughters phone and I peaked at it, the message read, \u201cI know sweetie just three more days\u201d and it was from her dad. I opened the phone to see tons of messages of them two going back and forth with her telling him that she was sick of being here, she didn\u2019t want to be near me after I did that, she couldn\u2019t believe I would cheat, she\u2019s disgusted by Me, and her father just agreed and consoled her. \n\nI\u2019d asked him multiple times if he knew anything about her behavior and he said no, he put the blame on me for no reason. \n\nI called him once again after that, and messaged him about it when he didn\u2019t respond and got left on read.\n\nI sat my daughter down and told her that I know she\u2019s angry at me, and I tried to shelter her from this and keep her ad far away from this as possible, but I won\u2019t be held accountable for actions that weren\u2019t mine. I left any and all questions that i couldn\u2019t say without his perspective out.\n\nShe was shocked and apologized for her behavior to me. This wasn\u2019t some petty revenge to get back at him, but I cant have my relationship with hers ruined either.\nI\u2019m now getting blasted by all of my family and his for doing this so AITA", "created_utc": 1671454706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpqwfz/aita_for_telling_my_kid_the_real_reason_me_and/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But we can't be together now, because dad make a serious mistake and hurt me very badly.\"", "NTA,Sincerely, he ought to be completely exposed for this.", "Yeah me to, but as for the family I\u2019m not sure what they do or don\u2019t know. Some of it is his family to so I can\u2019t say much to them.", "There a few posts on here similar to my situation, and yes I do thank god.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out the reason why he did it before proceeding but I think either way I might have to. just like others pointed out I find it weird to try and take her away and bring her to court as if the truth wouldn\u2019t be shown eventually so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here.", "I\u2019m sure he has, I feel like he just told them I had outed him and not the rest,  I haven\u2019t tried replying to anyone yet, quite a bit if people and no part of me is in a mood to be arguing with everyone right now.", "Oh, uh, I really don't think all 3 of them together is a good idea. Unless there's a therapist and a bouncer present", "Once this cools down a bit and all the heat is off, it hoping we can get to that pointn", "I think because it ended the way it did, even thought my girl is an intelligent young lady, she still feels the same way she did just to her father, which is that he chose sex over her. I never wanted my kids to feel that way. So it\u2019s difficult to just tell her that when you know it\u2019s going to ruined their relationship", "I denied it of course but I had no idea where it was coming from, so at the time I obviously didn\u2019t say what actually happened, and I tried my best to not throughout this time but at first she didn\u2019t believe be. \n\nAs of right now I\u2019m not getting any answers from him for why he did it. Only angry messages that I outed him.", "My POV here was me trying to not let the insecurities in my relationship reflect on their relationship as father and daughter. I mean trust me i was enraged but my daughter knowing her would and did take this extremely hard I didn\u2019t want this to have a permanent affect on their relationship \n\nI agree with all the points you made, but my mind was on protecting my daughter and the repercussions this may have", "Booooooooo", "The father ruined his own relationship with the daughter by trying to alienate her from OP.", "Op put in the post that she saw the messages of HIM telling THEIR daughter that she had been the one who cheated. Then on top of that, she went to him and asked him if he had told her that before she saw the messages and he lied to her about it. It seems you\u2019re only understanding the fact that she told her daughter the truth. I think YOU\u2019RE TA for not reading the whole post.", "Yeah, exactly, the kid should know the truth, why do they want to protect this loser from the truth, when this loser didn\u2019t protect his or her family. OP, NTA.", "You absolutely can and SHOULD tell them the whole story. If other people lie about you, you\u2019re always justified in using the truth to clear your name. If he wanted this secret, he shouldnt have started this shit.\n\nEvery single time someone confronts you about this, tell them the whole story. You\u2019re choosing to suffer because he chose to lie; he should suffer for creating this problem, not you.", "Are you able to talk to them about it to make sure they know what really happened? Or like, draft some kind of written account of what happened on your side as neutrally but true as possible? If he's been going behind your back to turn your daughter against you, it wouldn't be surprising if it extended further out. Heck, sometimes just being the first to paint a messy situation is grounds to bend it a good bit in your own favor--and people abuse that, sometimes.", "On Facebook: \n\n\u201cOn X date back in 2000whatever, I came home and discovered my husband (name) in bed with (name) and (name.) This ended our marriage. \n\nI recently found out that ex husband (name) has been telling our 15 year old daughter that I am the person that cheated and caused the divorce. My understanding is he has repeated this lie about me to friends and family as well.\n\nThank you for reading.\u201d\n\nPut him on blast. Screenshot everything. Angela Bassett this guy\u2019s lies and clear your name.", "You absolutely need to say EVERYTHING to them. The WHOLE story, the cheating, the lies to manipulate your daughter, the screenshots, EVERYTHING. There is absolutely no reason to be afraid to \"out\" him when he cheated on you and nearly destroyed your relationship with your daughter. Absolutely everyone needs to know.", "1. He simply wanted to turn her against you to get revenge for divorcing you. 2. Depending on the custody, he could put it against you to take you to court for custody and have sole or majority custody and depending on the money, that you will pay him or stop paying you.", "Maybe your daughter kept pushing him for reasons for the divorce, not taking equivocation for an answer.  So he chose this.", "What's happening here simple : parental alienation \nAt the same time he's a coward \nIt's time to prepare a folder to defend yourself\n\nYou're far from being the AH here on the contrary you're a strong woman and you have my respect. \n\nI know it's not fair but because I'm \"young ans stupid\" I'd confront him about his lies face to face while recording all that (I know its against the law but he started it first)", "Get yourself a template message explaining the WHOLE timeline and what went down with your daughter, with a few screenshots. It's also important to say you had agreed with your ex that the reason of the split would remain between you but that it's your ex's actions that led to him being \"outed\". \n\nThen copy/paste to anyone contacting you in any way.", "Up until this moment, we have been civil with eachother for the sake of our daughter so I\u2019m hoping that stays that same but I doubt it", "Absolutely best to let cooler heads prevail. Right now is too soon for everyone, since your ex won't admit it, your daughter just found out she was lied to, and you just found out that your ex lied.", "I understand, she may benefit from counseling regarding the split but anger and grief and even betrayal are normal healthy responses to it. Black and white thinking is age appropriate(one of you MUST be evil for the marriage to end). In reality, most (though not all) divorce happens between two people neither of whom is the actual devil, they just want drastically different things and decide they can\u2019t find compromise. It sounds like your husband wanted extramarital sex, or maybe just more/different sex, to be happy or something like that and decided that pursuing that happiness might be something worth losing what he had over. Lots of people cheat in relationships just because they think they\u2019re slick enough to have it both ways, and they\u2019re shocked when they\u2019re caught. I don\u2019t know the specifics of your situation obviously, but she is correct that he chose to risk his relationship with you and, yes, with her to pursue something she probably sees as not necessary/a frivolous gamble. He lost. She is valid in feeling betrayed that he was willing to take that risk, and the nuance around that is something she will only be able to work through when she\u2019s ready.", "NTA, IMO you should show the texts your ex has been sending you in retaliation to your daughter. He had no hesitation in defaming you at all and he  didnt even think how it would affect your daughter's relationship to you. He didnt think how it would affect a 15 year old girl. I dont think he should be around your daughter.\n\nPeople show us who they are in tiny little ways. Take them seriously when they do.", "You're better off never again expecting him to do anything kind, rational or for your benefit /peace of mind. He has nothing left to lose and if he's anything like other people I've seen do this sort of thing, he's only going to worse. Keep any proof you have of his lies and schemes.", "Yeah I know you did what a good mother does - wants to shield their child of any pain and protect her relationship with her father.   \nReality is he isnt a good man nor a good father - as he actively sabotaged your relationship by lying. Who splits a mother and child apart like that with lies? Its sick.    \n\n\nShe's old enough to judge her father now - let her have that free will to decide. Dont cover for him. Just factually answer her. And protect her from any of your family who are blasting you about this - they shouldnt be in her life.", "I could. But it\u2019s a lot of people, and very defiant and argumentative people from my experience so I\u2019m just trying to take whatever energy I have to argue with them about it because I know they won\u2019t believe me or they will have an issue with something.", "I'm not trying to worry you, but yeah, don't bank on it. Try to be very wise whenever you communicate with him from now on. Let him make mistakes and keep the proof", "I am sorry, but to me it looks like as if your ex did not only want to put you in bad light, but also wanted to alienate you from your daughter so that she would prefer staying with him. The message \"just 3 more days\" and the exchange about how she doesn't like to stay with you anymore (which I am sure was not talked down by your ex) speak loudly.\n\nUnfortunately lots of people change after a split, even if the breakup was amicable at first. Your ex would not be the first to try to change custody through malicious behavior, and/or get you in a position to pay child support.\n\nStay alert and on the lookout for his next steps, he might not be valuing your once made promises a lot.", "Time for civilityis over.  Turning the other cheek just gets u slapped on both sides.  Being the bigger person doesnt mean go along to get along. It means doing whats right even whenits unpopular or hurts.  Be the bigger person.", "I agree", "She believes me and apologized to me a lot, I don\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire. Or make her suffer more because of this. If I\u2019m some weird situation this has to be explained again than maybe I do need to have proof but I\u2019m hoping everyone just fesses up and we can now just work on the healing process", "Do you have proof he cheated? Because you're going to need it, they're going to drag your daughter with this mess. You need to talk to your lawyer asap. NTA He's on a smear campaign against you, so you need all the proof you can get.", "Just send them screenshots of what he was telling your daughter and say, \u201cI would never have said anything but I\u2019m not going to be lied about\u201d", "Well you are being the better person. Ultimately it does pay off. But having read what you wrote about your ex what you hope for will not happen. You are doing your best and thats the only thing that can be done. Best wishes."]}
