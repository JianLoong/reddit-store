I don\u2019t) comments which I just laughed and heard. she then questioned me about getting surgery and how she was just couldn\u2019t believe I did it on my own. I kindly laughed again, and said nope this was all me. We were talking as a group and we got food. She was watching me eat and get food (before when I was obese I was too scared in front of everyone) and she said \u201cwow cheat day for you?\u201d. I just ignored the bitterness in it and replied \u201cwho can resist fries\u201d and we all laughed. It finally took a turn when we were all having a convo and she just says to me \u201calright tell me your secret, are you a heavy smoker or purger type?\u201d.\n\nAt that point, I had it. I said how I never asked to be obese. I said how I grew up in an abusive environment where I was force fed a lot and it changed my psyche. I firmly stated that it took more than just a few \u201cjuice diets\u201d and I had to reprogram myself and change my relationship with my health. \n\nI ended my little speech by saying \u201cI\u2019m sure we all know what it\u2019s like to be in a toxic relationship (referring to mine with health). I am grateful every day i was able to break mine, can\u2019t say the same for most people, right?\u201d \n\nSome of my friends were smiling and soft snapping but she just had the most shocked look on her face and stormed to her bfs room.

Incredibly intrusive and went too far when she insinuated EDs. What you did was nothing compared to her attacks. You actually opened up about your painful past, and explained the reasons for your healthy recovery. Yeah, then you pointed out that she shouldn\u2019t be talking about any toxic relations with anything given her current one but that was par for the course. If that\u2019s all it takes to bring her down after all she gave you, well, boohoo.", "NTA. \n\nShe asked for it. \n\nCongratulations on the weight loss and good for you for sticking up for yourself.", "Mm, she'll live. She was rude, relentlessly so, and I can't imagine anyone honestly thinking she didn't have it coming. \n\nPutting your foot down in that kind of situation and taking charge of your own narrative when others keep trying to shoot you down for something you're really proud of? That you've put incredible amounts of effort into? This is hardly asshole territory.\n\nNTA. Congrats for developing a healthier relationship with health!", "Nta. You defended yourself from her shitty comments.", "NTA.  She clearly made negative judgments about you based upon your previous weight and felt entitled to treat you rudely.  I have noticed when people lose a lot of weight, there are always people that act like the person doesn't deserve to be slimmer.  Like they now resent you because they cannot look down on you as easily.  Weird behaviors.  You had every reason to tell her how it is", "NTA and congrats on your achievement bro I know how hard it is \ud83d\udcaa", "NTA. Your comment may have been slightly passive aggressive, but you were standing up for yourself. The comments the other person was making was downright rude", "She was the asshole\n\nYou were not\n\nI\u2019d have told her to stfu and leave me alone", "Nta.

Your friends GF deserved to harshly be called out for her crap. She\u2019s a toxic, nasty person. \n\nGood for your for taking care of yourself in healthy mental and physical ways!

But, it\u2019s the fact she continued making the jokes/comments that was wrong.\nIn short, she should\u2019ve dropped the topic of your weight loss after her initial comment.

Big time.  She wasn't just rude, she was continually mean and made your experience not just unpleasant, but painful.  It isn't rude to tell the truth, and that's what you did.  And you know what, even if you'd been deliberately rude to her (you weren't), I can't think of a more deserving recipient of rudeness that this awful girl.\n\nP.S.

That's so difficult.", "NTA.\n\nCongratulations for losing so much weight - I can't imagine how much effort and hard work you had to invest in order to do so! I think you were super patient initially and quick-witted with your responses, and applaud you for that. She was being shitty, insensitive, and judgmental and I think most of us would have responded similarly", "NTA\n\n\nShe literally accuses you of having an eating disorder, or lying about getting surgery. She is 100% jealous. \n\n\nIf she feels called out because she knows her relationship is toxic, that's on her.", "NTA but that\u2019s coming from someone who use experience this all the time. Her remarks are actually comments I would hear from the vast majority of people who knew me when I was fat.
