I went to my mum (44f) today, to ask her if she could please clean it or tell my brother to, she immediately started to get defensive and asked me to just clean it. now, if it was my own mess i would, but i have severe OCD and even minor things like this can make me feel sick, and my mother is aware of this. I told her, that i should not have to clean a grown ass man\u2019s piss from the seat, as he is an adult and i am not his mother. she took this as me demanding it be her to clean it when i simply requested if she could do it or if she could ask him to. She asked me to tell him myself then and even though i repeatedly told her he won\u2019t listen to me she stood her ground. so i sucked it up and asked him myself, and as expected all he did was make fun of me for not being able to do it myself. it was only resolved when my dad had enough and told my brother off. my mum is still very angry and keeps snapping at me and won\u2019t let me talk to her, so now i\u2019m wondering, was i in the wrong and should i apologise to her?", "created_utc": 1683373796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139kq98/aita_for_telling_my_mum_that_my_brothers_mess/", "score": 1143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
