I went to my mum (44f) today, to ask her if she could please clean it or tell my brother to, she immediately started to get defensive and asked me to just clean it. now, if it was my own mess i would, but i have severe OCD and even minor things like this can make me feel sick, and my mother is aware of this. I told her, that i should not have to clean a grown ass man\u2019s piss from the seat, as he is an adult and i am not his mother. she took this as me demanding it be her to clean it when i simply requested if she could do it or if she could ask him to. She asked me to tell him myself then and even though i repeatedly told her he won\u2019t listen to me she stood her ground. so i sucked it up and asked him myself, and as expected all he did was make fun of me for not being able to do it myself. it was only resolved when my dad had enough and told my brother off. my mum is still very angry and keeps snapping at me and won\u2019t let me talk to her, so now i\u2019m wondering, was i in the wrong and should i apologise to her?", "created_utc": 1683373796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139kq98/aita_for_telling_my_mum_that_my_brothers_mess/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your brother AND your mother, at the same time, when they're both there, that your brother's piss on the toilet seat is for him to clean up at the time he spills, and if he won't clean up after himself, you won't ever clean up after him.  Your brother is behaving disgustingly and he's the AH here - your mom ought to speak to him about it, but it's not reasonable to expect her to clean up after her adult son's messes either.", "NTA - this is why my son cleans the toilet in the hall bathroom and his sister cleans the sink \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA.

My 9 year old knows better than to leave pee on the toilet. We have a choices in my house. \n\n1) Aim better\n2) clean up after yourself\n3) sit your butt down when you pee\n\nAlso, this is on your parents as a grown man should know to clean up after himself.

I've talked to (brother) but he makes fun of my ocd and didn't clean up. I'm out of options, could you please tell him to clean his mess up?\"", "This is the biggest issue I have at a parts store where I am the only female on staff. I was given a key to the women\u2019s room & the men\u2019s has a toilet & urinal. The men\u2019s restroom is atrocious. Dried Poop stains all around the inside bowl & the urinal is yellow stained & has hairs. \ud83e\udd22\n\nSo, I don\u2019t normally work weekends & I have noticed on occasion that the Store Manager opened the women\u2019s restroom & I would come in on Monday with the seat up & multiple urine stains. I WAS livid!  I dragged my SM into the restroom & pointed. THIS is why I will NEVER share.  Because I would have to constantly clean up the toilet just so I can sit down & use it.  And I damn well am NOT going to clean up after you men!\n\nThis is a hill I will die on. And I can happily report that 17 months later, I still have my own restroom. Lol", "I'd be talking to him in a baby voice...when I saw him going to the bog I'd be putting on my most slow and sing-song voice \"don't forget to aim into the hole, as pee-pee goes down the toilet, ok sunshine?\" or \"do you need me to ask your mummy to show you how to peepee like a big strong boy?\" etc.\n\nWhen his mates came over I'd be telling them \"does he peepee on the floor at your houses like he does here?\"\n\nI'd even buy him some pampers pull-ups. Or a litter tray etc.\n\nOr show him this post.\n\nBut...I'm a bitch.\n\nAnd tell your Mum: \"look Mum he needs to learn not to pee on the floor like a toddler. You need to tell him to clean it up.

That\u2019s probably why she got so defensive, you should\u2019ve just asked her to tell him to clean it instead of asking her to do it. He should clean up after himself obviously so he\u2019s the real AH", "ESH\n\nYou went to your mom like she was your hired housecleaner, had you not led with asking her to do it, instead just asked her to set the brother straight next chance she gets I imagine her reaction would have been very different.\n\nBut she should have backed you on the issue, leaving your mess for other housemembers to clean up is unacceptable for anyone older than a toddler.\n\nAs an almost adult you should be part of the daily upkeep of the house, just like your brother and dad. My gut feeling is most of that work falls on your mom with noone helping? This would explain her annoyance, though obviously I might be wrong on this.\n\nRegarding your OCD - is it just cleaning a toilet someone else used or also your own?\nEither way you should look into occupational therapy, there are ways to desensitize oneself to become less hindered in everyday life by your OCD and it will likely help you deal with everyday life in the future. Don't let it run your life for you, it will feel great every time you beat your OCD and reclaim some part of your freedom.", "ESH, I've got kids the same age as you two, and I can say for certain that I am so sick of playing referee to them because they should be mature enough to have conversations without yelling. You're not the ah for not wanting to clean your older brothers piss off the seat, but you're the ah for not talking to your brother first and leaving your mom out of it. Your mom kinda sucks for just allowing your brothers urine to hang out for people to sit on instead of telling him it's nasty. Your brother sucks for being nasty.", "YTA for asking her to do it, but NTA for refusing to do it.  He should do it.

It's not her job either, and if you led with \"please clean it mommy\" that's not a very adult way of handling the situation.", "YTA, just tell your brother directly, your both old enough to do that.", "YTA. You should address this with your brother as a first step, rather than tattling", "YTA. You talk to your brother.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nI make my kid clean his own pee off the seat and he\u2019s almost 9 (a quick wipe with toilet roll and then he comes to tell me so I can clean it properly) if he can do that a 17 year old definitely can.

He should\u2019ve learned a long time ago how to clean up after himself.", "NTA \nIf you do clean up after him put the tissues or cloth used to do so on his pillows with a note stating every time you have to wipe the seat because he aims like a stormtrooper you will leave the soiled items used on his mess on his bed, in his car (on hot sunny days to make sure the arroma lingers) in his wallet in the draw with his clean underwear or any other location you choose until he proves he's a big boy and can clean up after himself.", "NTA.

Your brother is a jerk for not cleaning after himself.\n\nMaybe you should take pictures and casually mention in front of his friends or future partners what he does and doesnt in the bathroom. \nHe made fun of you? Well, embarrass him in front of people he cares and let's see about.\n\nYou mother is also TA", "100% NTA. Even if he were a kid, he should learn to not splash and make a mess. \nBut especially as a freaking adult, he can either learn to aim or owe sitting down.

After that never flushed without putting the toilet top on & never use hand dryers in public restrooms even with toilet seat covers bc most ppl don\u2019t put the tops down. \n\nHave you ever flushed while still sitting and felt the water splash on you?

How she responds would tell you how you should handle her in the future. NTA", "I was going to tell Op to smear a good amount of period blood on the seat and leave it for her brother to discover.
