Edit: you are in no way to blame for this.  But it occurs to me that giving them so much time let them allow themselves to be complacent.

I just moved so I know it can be difficult, but that's also why you live within your means.", "NTA - Most places give MUCH less time than you gave. I am sorry that you are going through this, and I am sorry for them too, but you gave over 6 months to plan, save, prepare and be ready.", "YTA Does this feel good to you?", "YTA.\n\nWait, hear me out before all manner of downvotes come flooding in.  There's a specific reason for the YTA.\n\nOP, it seems you haven't really checked the landlord laws where you live. In Florida, where you seem to be from, it's illegal to terminate a rental situation without cause. It's called a \"No Cause Eviction.\"  You can end the lease, but the way the law is structured, your giving them two extra months is converting from a lease situation, to a month to month, which uses different laws.  Meaning, that you either have to go to the court (self-help evictions are illegal there) and have the court file an eviction notice...or you must make them leave the day their lease expires.  Those are your only legal options in Florida.\n\nThe letter of the law says about this, in part, \"A Florida landlord can terminate without cause a month-to-month tenancy by giving the tenant a written notice at least 15 days before the end of the monthly period. The notice must inform the tenant that the tenancy will end in 15 days and that the tenant must move out of the rental unit by that time. (Fla. Stat. \u00a7 83.57 (2022).)\"  It goes on to note \"A tenant can choose to fight an eviction. This would increase the amount of time the eviction lawsuit takes. The tenant might have several valid defenses, such as the landlord making procedural mistakes during the eviction (for example, improperly serving a notice or not waiting long enough before filing the eviction lawsuit).\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After dealing with a recent squatter situation that thankfully did not need a formal eviction I can sympathize with how stressful this is.  6.5 months is more than enough time to find a new place, they are trying to take advantage at this point.\n\n One thing we did to coax our squatter out was to pay for a uhaul rental to get their belongings out of our property.

It worked, but unfortunately they also stole alot of the furniture that was also inside the house as well. \ud83d\ude44 about 99% of the things stolen we were going to have to toss out anyway due to cigarette smoke damage,  but they also stole a computer that had personal information on (computer has since been recovered after we threatened to involve the police).

There is insufficient information provided by the OP to determine where the rental property is located. It might be, it might not be.\n\nSecond: There is nothing in the original post to suggest that OP is pursuing a self help eviction. In fact, in light of the fact OP said that they \u201cstarted eviction in December\u201d and that the tenant called crying that they\u2019d be in the street if OP proceeded, it actually appears that OP is going through the formal process of eviction.\n\nI would also point out that failing to adhere to strict legal procedural rules does not, in most circumstances, make one an asshole. It may be foolish and it may prevent them from obtaining the legal remedy they seek, but people can screw themselves without being assholes.\n\nFinally, OPs question has nothing to do with the precise mechanisms required for a lawful eviction in any jurisdiction. OP is asking whether they are an asshole for seeking to evict the tenant at all in these circumstances. Whether the precise legal process of eviction has been adhered to is of no significance to that core moral determination.", "We terminated the lease with 3 month notice and yes that unfortunately converted this to a month to month.
