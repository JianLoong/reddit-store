We met and later married when Joshua was five. His maternal grandparents are still a large part of his life even now that he is twelve. We have never tried to keep them away. \n\nMy husband and I are now having our second child and Joshua has started acting up. It is strange because he is a loving and well behaved boy. \n\nLately he has been saying that I'm not his real mom and that he doesn't have to listen to me. I thought maybe he was saying what other kids in his school say to their step parents. It would be odd since I've been his mom since he was three and a half. \n\nIt turns out that his mother's parents are the ones telling him that. I don't know what started it but I'm ending it. I spoke with my husband and he agreed with me. \n\nMy husband works out of town and his inlaws are still relatively young and still work. I called them and said that since they were telling him he did not need to listen to me I would be dropping him off with them. I provided his school and extracurricular schedule and told them I expected him to attend everything. \n\nI never spoke with Joshua about this. I never had any intentions of following through. \n\nThey started fighting me immediately saying that I had no right to kick him out. I said I wasn't kicking him out. But that I had a small child at home and was in my third trimester. I wasn't going to deal with a kid my size that refuses to follow the house rules because of them. I said that I had copies of all the texts where they told him that he did not have to do as I said so they could deal with him when my husband is out of town. \n\nThey do not have a child friendly home. They have lots of small, expensive, breakable things all over. And his grandfather has professional clients in the house all the time. A twelve year old would not be a good fit. \n\nThey said that they were sorry for interfering and that they would tell him that they were wrong. I insisted on witnessing it. And I told them not to bring up the threat or I would follow through. \n\nThey did it. Afterwards Joshua apologized for his behavior and said he was kind of lost since I was going to have a son of my own. I told him that he was my son and had been for a very long time. I could see them grinding their teeth. They seem to think that if I'm his mom then they are nothing. This whole thing is weird.

No less important, but not his bio mom.

Yup! But never forget to give acknowledgement and respect to the mom who delivered him and that he lost. It will also drastically improve the grandparents relationship if the mom is remembered for the son, while the second mom is also respected. \n\nYour approach is a fun story, but you could have just mentioned to them that you saw the texts and they need to adjust their behavior.

He shouldn\u2019t be punished by them having a lapse in judgment. Does he have pictures of his mom? I\u2019d get one and frame it and have him help find a place of honor to hang it.

I'll go with NTA for now, but it could still blow up on you.  \n\n\nI will suggest something my Mom did when she remarried.  She sat me and my siblings down and said, \"No, he's not your father.  He will never replace your father.  He is, however, going to be my husband and will also be \"the other adult in charge\" here.\"  I wonder if OP had called the grandparents and simply said, \"You're right, I'm not his mother (even though he calls me that).  But I am the other adult in charge at this house, and he is expected to follow the house rules.\"", "ESH.  I hope you've told your husband about your threat.  I also hope Joshua never hears about it because he's going to accept as fact that you were going to put him out of the house.  \nYou got what you wanted and the grandparents fell in line, but I think there were more honest ways to get there.", "YTA.\n\nI understand what you did, and that you were bluffing to a prove a point, but you chose a tactic that will backfire terribly as soon as the grandparents think about this for even a second.\n\nYou have proof that these grandparents have been manipulating your step-son behind your back, pouring poison in his ear against you.\n\nYou have just given them the opportunity to start pouring even worse poison into his ear. Now they can tell him that they were forced to say those things because you were threatening to kick him out of your home and abandon him. To protect him and save his relationship with his dad, they had to throw themselves under the bus because that's how much they love him. But, they're going to have to be careful and secretive now because you warned them that if they ever reveal the truth to him, you'll carry through with your threat to abandon him. \n\nFrom their perspective, they wouldn't even be lying because the whole point of this act was to make them believe exactly that so that they'd cave. \n\nThere are many different types of lie, but you have given them the opportunity to use the most powerful type of all... the ability to lie with the truth. Its power rests in the fact that it's built on a genuine truth that by itself will paint you in a terrible light to your stepson. Just as your stepson is feeling vulnerable about being displaced by your biological child, you've told the grandparents you will abandon him if they tell him about your threat to do so.\n\nThis is not the resolution you think it is. As soon as the grandparents realise the rammifications of what you've done, they will go to war with the ammo you've just handed them. They will become the heroes. You will become the villain.\n\nWhy didn't you and your husband sit down with the boy and discuss what the grandparents had been telling him and discuss his place in the family when the baby comes, so that the manipulation, lies and fears could all be addressed openly? Why didn't you sit down with the grandparents and try to find out what had changed to make them toxic, given that you said there isn't a history of this behaviour and you don't know what caused it to begin? Yes, trying to have mature discussions about triggers, fears and issues may not have worked out, but your post makes it sound like you didn't even try. \n\nI truly hope I'm wrong and that this won't blow up in your face later on, but I fear that, as soon as the grandparents figure this out, you'll have made things worse for your family in the long-run.", "You're technically not biologically his mom. What the grandparents did was not right, but they obviously have a problem with you being called 'mom'. Your power play was very clever, but probably didn't do much to endear you to them. Why not just go straight to them with your husband and ask them what the problem is? I don't know if I can say you're TA, but more kindness would've gotten at the core of the issue rather than whatever detente you've now (temporarily) arrived at.", "Yes you were. \n\nYou are the aita \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you talk to your husband? Seriously. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to your step son. \n\nBtw you are not his mother. Yes he must follow your rules, unless you banned Christmas or something, or make he live under the stairs. \n\nBe the adult.", "NTA but you have to be careful that Joshua isn\u2019t made to feel like the optional unwanted child, especially since you are having a new son. \n\nIt\u2019s really important that you show him you love him and that he belongs in your house.", "these comments seem insane i'm sorry, this isn't some tiger mom achievement, this has just given the grandparents more ammo to use in the future plus what about op's husband does he know about any of this, op not to be cruel or erase her love for joshua is just a stepmum", "Yep. You manipulated them, instead of handling it like a mature,  rational adult.  Shame on you.  YTA.", "You had me in the first half\u2026\n\nNTA. As long as Joshua doesn\u2019t find out I think you\u2019re fine. Maybe some family therapy to address the new baby is warranted.", "Afterwards Joshua apologized for his behavior and said he was kind of lost since I was going to have a son of my own\u2014 please get this child counseling. He apologizEd but in his child\u2019s mind he could think - my mom died and my stepmom wants me to go away.", "YTA. If he really was your son you wouldn\u2019t be threatening to dump him in someone else\u2019s house (a 12 years old). \n\nWould this be something you would do with your yet to be born child?\n\nYou and him know that you can never be his mom.", "Why in the world would the grandparents do this! People amaze me. It may be that the in-laws are triggered by the new baby and are acting out in an immature manner without realizing how important of an age 12 is for children especially boys that are trying to become their own person but still impressionable enough that attention and care are needed as they negotiate the transitions in their bodies and relationships. The in-laws should be grateful that OP has been a present and loving mother to their grandson.", "Jealousy isn't rational. They went way out of bounds. NTA", "NTA. They were assholes to fill his head with nonsense.  They got exactly what they deserved.", "NTA. But it might be a good idea to get him into therapy. It sounds like he has a lot of feelings and some insecurity to work through that the grandparents were able to prey on. Giving him a safe space where he can talk and have an objective listener who can help him build boundaries and understand these more difficult concepts might be beneficial to him.", "NTA. Marvelously done, no notes.", "NTA. You handled this in the best possible way, without lasting damage to your relationship with your stepson. But don't turn your back on his maternal grandparents, you should still consider monitoring his conversations with them.", "They fucked around and found out. This was a perfect response. They are the elders and they should know better. Behaving like children and then instructing a child to do something like this is incredibly disgusting. NTA", "NTA.  Not only NTA, but you should get some kind of award.  Of all the meddling grandparent stories that come up in the various AITA or JUSTNO subs, this is the best way I've ever seen it handled. Good for you.", "Info: does Joshua know you threatened to kick him out for normal behavior? It doesn\u2019t matter that you had no intention to follow through does he know you made the threat?", "NTA. Grandparents interfering with your parenting need to be put in their place.", "NTA\nI\u2019m over here giving you a standing ovation/golfers clap/whistle and hoot! You handled this wonderfully!!\n\nAnd so glad your SO backed you cuz your SON\u2019s grandparents are a bit shitty here. \n\nTo add to their shame? Maybe make sure your son doesn\u2019t forget his real mom too. Encourage your husband telling him about her so he doesn\u2019t buy into any future falsities the grandparents might spin\u2026and to further show that you\u2019re not competing with a ghost. You\u2019re just trying to raise a kid.", "NTA. I love you. Brav-Fucking-O. \n\nThe grandparents had no right to undermine your family arrangement of respecting his mom, including his mom\u2019s parents in his life, and still be a family leader. By leader I mean helping him choose his activities, staying on top of his academics, and communicating with him (including discipline). \n\nYou outlined what their life would be like if you respected their stance and had them parent him. I love it. \n\nYou straightened it out without the child until it was time to straighten it out with him present. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "That was an ingenious solution, and I am in awe of your power. NTA, and congrats on both your upcoming baby and for reestablishing peace in your household. Now that your son has been able to air what has been bothering him, he might settle down a bit. Especially without the grandparents whispering insecurities into his ear.", "NTA and well done on addressing it, the poor kid though. You are a great mom but please do make sure he is OK he needs a little bit of special attention, I'd do super ised visits from now on with the grandparents.", "Just make sure that your son knows this is NOT about him or his behavior. You are his parent no matter how badly he behaves- bad behavior may bring consequences but you will never abandon him .  And at 12 he can understand that people don\u2019t replace people- just as he can love you and his mom you can love him and your new son- be sure you give him that reassurance.", "Damn girl, you should give tutorials on how to stand up for yourself! You're killin' it!", "NTA - when your husband returns he needs to have a sit down with them and make it clear in no uncertain terms that if they ever try and pull that emotional manipulation/parental alienation sh*t again their time with their grandson will be drastically reduced and will never be unsupervised", "NTA.\n\nThey were the manipulative ones, towards a minor. Kudos to you for handling the situation so well!", "NTA. You handled this beautifully!", "NTA. Nicely handled.", "NTA -", "NTA. Holy effing geezus that is one of the most amazing ways of Handling It that I have ever heard. Kudos!!", "You didn\u2019t manipulate them in anyway. People just don\u2019t seem to understand, if you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. Good for you.", "NTA. You handled that like a boss. They tried to make a problem for you so you threatened to make that problem theirs.

I like this and I like the way you handled it. The grandparents had no business doing what they did but you basically knocked two birds with one stone; you straightened up your stepson and you pretty much told his grandparents to knock it off in a creative way.", "nta. hes disowning you after you took care of him for 15+ years of his life.", "NTA.  You didn't manipulate anything.  Your corrected a problem", "Classic case of FAFO. Your move was masterful. It was a risk though. What would have happened if they said yes and told him he was being kicked out of his house? Anyway. NTA", "Well done OP.  You took their very own words and used them against your in laws.  Who the hell are they to start playing games with your relationship to your step son after you've been in his life for the past 9 years?  The fact they are upset they lost their game shows they knew they were wrong but felt there would be little to no repercussions for what they did.  Good on you for recognizing what was going on and also to your husband for backing you up on this.  \n\nI have to wonder what their end game was?  Why destroy your relationship with Joshua if they have not made plans to house him?  Or were they hoping to break you and your husband up over this?  This was a very risky solution that could have really blown up in your face.  Have you and husband talked about limiting Joshua's time with them in the future after this fiasco?", "NTA. And wow I'm so impressed by how you handled this. Congratulations - really well done!", "NTA And honestly, they need to be cut off from him for a while. Dad needs to do it, not OP. They cannot be trusted and the baby is due soon. They will just be smarter next time and tell him in person or during chats where there is no trace. He does NOT need people without his best interests filling his head with BS. They are deliberately choosing to make him unhappy and depressed. Who does that? These are grown adults, not an older child. They need to be no contact for at least 6 months, and then all contact extremely monitored. No unsupervised visits", "Not really anything to judge, they admitted they were wrong, he apologized, everything ended amicably as far as your story leads us to believe.", "Nta", "Not the Asshole.  \nThis is a communication problem.  \nPeople dont spend the precious moments they have left on this Earth being transparent about their feelings out of fear of rejection.  \nIt seems that your post is a giant rejection wheel for everyone.  \nI'd make the effort to personally express how hurt your feelings were, how much you love them, and how hard you work to preserve the legacy of their daughter, and also- how critical it is that they join you in this cause as a team.  \nTell them how lucky you are to have not 1, not 2, but 3 sets of grandparents /mother/father figures in your life. Spend time updating them on your family, your life.  \nIn short- put in the work so that they will as well.  \nImagine how awkward it might feel if your to be born baby were to grow up, marry, and pass away. How do you know where the boundaries of intimacy within the family are without invitations?  \n\n\nI believe that there are defensive mechanisms at play here. And they may reject you at first out of fear you may not be genuine. But if you are consistent, persistent, and lead with your \"IDGAF - I love you even if you are an asshole and you cant stop me\" when dealing with them, all of this will diminish or even blossom to a loving crazy cooky family situation.  \nThere are no sides in families unless someone is holding a stick in the dirt, as my grandmother used to say.

And they claim that you are the one being manipulative. Wow.", "NTA.  You are brilliant.  What a perfect way to block these nasty bullies and make them apologize in front of your son.  I'm glad your husband is standing up for you, too.  Those grandparents deliberately tried to alienate your son for their own emotional needs, and it was totally inappropriate.  You are being very kind to ever let them see your son again.", "NTA and damn. Nicely handled.", "I think this is ESH. \n\nI mean they\u2019re definitely the asshole and if I were them I would definitely take the kid with me thinking that he is unwanted.

They got themselves in this position and can seethe over how you pushed them into correcting it, quietly to themselves.  If you feel generous, remind them that you may never take their daughter's place, but are doing your best to try and make sure Joshua feels loved and cared for in her absence.  Instead of being bitter or upset over the what-ifs, they need to work with you to help raise him into a proper adult that his mother would have respected.  \n\nThey can help him connect to her without trying to push you out or otherwise estrange you from him.  I'm glad this played out well for you, but it was a risk to go this route.", "Clever unless the kid found out, at which point it would have been very damaging.", "They don't deserve any benefit of the doubt. \"She's not your mom, you don't have to listen to her\" is such a loaded statement especially to a child that is/will soon be going through puberty, and can start getting into big-kid type problems. Are his teachers his mom, are police his mom,  I know people in here love to throw around grandparents' rights,  but they don't deserve shit if that's the type of lesson they're teaching him.", "NTA. A total boss move!", "Exactly, I'm trying to figure out the hell is wrong with them. With all the evil step-mother stories out there, why wouldn't they be happy their child is getting real love from his step mother??? And isn't what they're doing illegal, isn't it parental alienation or something? \n\nPlus she is his real mother, she's done some real mothering for 10 years. Sadly his mom died, but he was blessed with another mother who loves him. Her first experience being a mother was with him, she'll always be his real mother.", "This is it.\nThe grandparents are the AH in this situation, but it's gotta feel like their daughter has been erased. \"They are still in his life even though he's 12\", I mean what the fuck is that? Of course they're still in his life, they're his grandparents, that doesn't end because his father got remarried.\n\nAlso, how many kids are there? Joshua, a half sibling and a baby on the way? Or just Joshua and the baby on the way? This wasn't clear", "but it wasn't safety so again that's more lies, op said that was a factor but her main motivation was to put the grandparents back in their place", "I agree. This may have seemed clever in the moment, but poor Joshua is the one who would have suffered the most if this had gone wrong and - as you rightly pointed out - may yet still suffer if he finds this out in the future.

Obviously, we expect to bury our parents, but who brings a child into this world expecting that they\u2019ll live to see them die?\n\nI never expect them to get over it. But as someone else pointed out, they need to manage their trauma.\n\nEven OP pointed out that they might be thinking that if OP is Joshua\u2019s mother, that makes them nothing. They don\u2019t want their grandson to forget their daughter, even though, since he lost his mother at age two, he only barely remembers her.\n\nI can cut them some slack for losing a daughter and not wanting to lose their grandson because their daughter has been replaced.\n\nBut they crossed the line when they told Joshua that he doesn\u2019t have to listen to her, an adult who lives in his home and has assumed more responsibility for him than anyone else.\n\nThat was pure spite. Do they also tell Joshua the he doesn\u2019t have to mind teachers, or other adults in charge of his extracurriculars, since these people are also not his mother?\n\nEven if they don\u2019t accept her as his mother, she\u2019s still an adult who takes care of him and sacrifices for his well-being. She\u2019s still entitled to deference and respect, mother or not.", "Yes, grieving parents. Especially for someone who loses a **child,** that grief can go on for the rest of their lives. And depending on their age, they may not feel like therapy is appropriate (even though they probably need it).\n\nYou are right that this narrative of \"you're not my real mom\" is recent and not good, but it is probably triggered by OP's pregnancy. Even with children from the same family, a new arrival can trigger problems with behavior, toilet training, eating, so many things. It's a bit unusual for it to happen in grandparents, but it isn't a typical situation. And they may not realize how malicious it really is.\n\nOP dealt with it well. I hope in the future she shows them kindness, and makes it clear that they are still a big part of the 12-year-old's family. They've had this incident, hopefully learned a lesson, and it's best for everyone especially the child, to move on amicably from it.", "The grief of losing a child does not have an expiration date.", "Could have started earlier but the boy is definitely at the age where he\u2019s going to start pulling away and questioning authority.", "Bot account", "And if the grandparents were decent people they would have seen this pregnancy as gaining another grandchild that they could love and build a relationship with. \n\nNTA", "The problem is that they're still grieving his birth mother. They probably see OP being such a good mom to the kid and it hurts knowing it's not their daughter in that role. I'm not sure the exact steps it took to get from that feeling to trying to alienate the kid but they don't feel like big ones. Still an AH thing to do but I understand the reasons\n\nNTA", "That comment got me too. Like why wouldn't they be? The mom died not the grandparents and they are still his family. As he gets older having them around will become more important because they will be able to give him a side of his biological mother that his father can't which is incredibly important. He needs to know where and who he came from.\n\nI think it is Joshua, half-sibling and a new baby coming? Unless she counts him as their first?", "You described it perfectly.", "After a decade with no birth mother dead, I'd be surprised if OP wasn't considered his legal parent. And as with adoption, that means she is his parents for health and education decisions.", "Their failure to manage their trauma was doing real, potentially lasting damage to a child in the critical stage of adolescence.  They get sympathy up to that point.  It is 100% on them to do the work now, whatever that looks like.  They didn't communicate, they didnt get helpnto manage their feelings. They whispered in the ear of a child and poisoned his relationship with the only functional mother he has now.  They're adults, not delicate glass flowers and they made an intentional effort to damage a child. They need counseling, but they are the ones who need to do it.", "Yeah, when it opened with \"my son Joshua\", I assumed that Joshua was OPs son, OPs husband had another child, and now the baby.\n\nMy apologies OP, I am not trying to critique your life or choices, just seek clarity on how many children there are.\n\nAlso, I guess my concern is that eventually this will lead to resentment as Joshua will effectively have 3 sets of grandparents, while the other children only have two. As someone whose grandparents had all died before I turned 5, is this going to create a problem with Joshua having maternal grandparents days, while the other kids share their maternal grandparents with Joshua? I don't know, I have no basis for comparison, but other AITA stories seem to suggest so", "He wasn\u2019t adopted and she is only in his life because she married his dad. Not saying she is bad. But in reality that isn\u2019t his mother.", "No that\u2019s means his dad is.", "ThatbI will agree with", "I mean what would the alternative be? The new kid has 2 sets, so to make it even you boot Joshua's maternal grandparents out? Resentment aside, you can't just even it out like that.", "We don't know if OP's status with regard to paternal status was either legalised. Would hope so as otherwise medical decision become a nightmare. But his grandparents are risking his emotional, mental and potentially physical health by trying to alienate him from the only maternal figure he has ever known. His birth mother died before he was 1 and OP been in his life since he was 2. So bit more than just the woman who married his father - she has been playing a maternal role for at least 7 years and maybe more. Grandparents need to actually consider their grandson's needs as well as their need for their daughter to be remembered and stop manipulating him.", "No doubt grand parents suck. But what she did was wrong. It could have backfired badly. Like I said in another comment she should have called her husband and they should have talked to the boy about what\u2019s going on and everything else. Not some petty crap. If he saw those  messages  the boy would be devastated."]}
