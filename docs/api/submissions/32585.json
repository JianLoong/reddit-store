We met and later married when Joshua was five. His maternal grandparents are still a large part of his life even now that he is twelve. We have never tried to keep them away. \n\nMy husband and I are now having our second child and Joshua has started acting up. It is strange because he is a loving and well behaved boy. \n\nLately he has been saying that I'm not his real mom and that he doesn't have to listen to me. I thought maybe he was saying what other kids in his school say to their step parents. It would be odd since I've been his mom since he was three and a half. \n\nIt turns out that his mother's parents are the ones telling him that. I don't know what started it but I'm ending it. I spoke with my husband and he agreed with me. \n\nMy husband works out of town and his inlaws are still relatively young and still work. I called them and said that since they were telling him he did not need to listen to me I would be dropping him off with them. I provided his school and extracurricular schedule and told them I expected him to attend everything. \n\nI never spoke with Joshua about this. I never had any intentions of following through. \n\nThey started fighting me immediately saying that I had no right to kick him out. I said I wasn't kicking him out. But that I had a small child at home and was in my third trimester. I wasn't going to deal with a kid my size that refuses to follow the house rules because of them. I said that I had copies of all the texts where they told him that he did not have to do as I said so they could deal with him when my husband is out of town. \n\nThey do not have a child friendly home. They have lots of small, expensive, breakable things all over. And his grandfather has professional clients in the house all the time. A twelve year old would not be a good fit. \n\nThey said that they were sorry for interfering and that they would tell him that they were wrong. I insisted on witnessing it. And I told them not to bring up the threat or I would follow through. \n\nThey did it. Afterwards Joshua apologized for his behavior and said he was kind of lost since I was going to have a son of my own. I told him that he was my son and had been for a very long time. I could see them grinding their teeth. They seem to think that if I'm his mom then they are nothing. This whole thing is weird.  But they are upset that I manipulated them into this position. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702015236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dg85s/aita_for_threatening_to_leave_my_stepson_with_his/", "score": 495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way, I do hope it works out, and your in laws are the much, much bigger AH for undermining you, his parent.", "Op played a dangerous game but was lucky to win. There's so many ways this could have gone wrong. I was reading waiting for the part where Joshua found out she was sending him to his grandparents and it devastated him.

I hope he never finds out about it at all.", "This FAFO moment was brought to you by OP.", "She never should of said what she said to the grandparents and realistically hubby should of been the one to handle this nonsense, E-S-H(but poor little kiddo dragged into adult squabbles).", "Oh yes. What would she have done if they had actually accepted this idea? And, like you said, what it Joshua learned about her bluff? Now he wouldn't know it was a bluff and that would have pushed him away HARDER \n\nHowever, that being said. I think OP is gonna have to be extra vigilant in monitoring what grandparents say to this poor boy. It sounds like this is a new development stemming from her pregnancy. I can't imagine this has been an ongoing problem otherwise he would have started this YOURE NOT MY MOM years ago. They are threatened by the pregnancy. Their daughter no longer has the special place as the one who had a child with Joshua's dad. It was their last trump card, that made their daughter better than OP. Now that's gone and they want to make sure Joshua knows OP isn't HIS MOM. they need goddamn grief counseling. \n\nESH the ploy may have worked but OMG how that could have blown up in OPs face. Glad things were resolved but please DO NOT pull a stunt like that again."]}
