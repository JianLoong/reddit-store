We are told about pushing with enough force to break ribs, we get drilled doing high quality CPR until sweat is pouring down our face and we are breathing hard as if we just ran a marathon. We are taught that even though we get on the patient as fast as we can, and maintain high quality support, we are going to have patients who *remain* dead. CPR is a chance at life, not a guarantee. \n\nDo you know how long a grown adult can do high quality CPR that allows for best chance of survival? \n\n2 minutes. \n\nAfter that the compression quality begins to degrade. They are not as deep, thus not providing as much circulation. \n\nYou expected a 14 year old child to provide high quality CPR to a loved one for how ever long it took to get an ambulance to her location.\n\nYou are angry and hurting and want someone to blame. And sometimes there is no one. You owe your sister a sincere apology for taking out your anger on her, for placing unrealistic and unreasonable expectations on a child.", "YTA. . . y'all left an under aged CHILD in charge. You expected her to be cool under pressure in a situation most adults would freak out at. You are TA if this is a real story. You permanently scared your sister, she will never fully recover from the severe emotional damage you intentionally inflicted.", ">Then my aunt pulled me and called me an AH and the devil etc and tbh that stuck on me\n\nIt probably won't stick with you longer than it will stick with your 14-year old sister regarding what *you* said to her.

She shouldn\u2019t have been expected to know what to do anyways.\n\nOut of everyone in this story your sister is the least to Blame for both your dad\u2019s death.

A 14 year old is no more responsible for not knowing how to perform cpr than they are for the heart attack.  And for all you know, it was already too late when she found him.

Yow dare you?\n\nYour cruelty to a traumatized child is breathtaking.   \n\n\nThe adults in this family failed her and failed your father.   \n\n\nShe was never responsible for your father\u2019s wellbeing.

You need to apologise to her as soon as you can to try and repair your relationship and allow you to grieve together.

Your kid sister has lost her dad too and is blaming herself for something that is not her fault because of what you said.", "YTA. \n\nBlaming your sister is an outlet for your grief. She was left to be a caretaker with no knowledge or experience at as a literal child.\n\nI understand you were working and were pushed to your limits. I understand that you had no other options and that everyone, including your sister, were put in positions they shouldn\u2019t have been in.\n\nBe mad at *that* - at a system that made your family fend for yourselves and left you no with no support.\n\nThe blame of what happened is on circumstance and society, on other family members and your extended support not helping more (what shift did your aunt take?), on how unfair this all was in the first place. It is not your sister.", "YTA, I am an ICU Rn, I have seen more than my fair share of new grads panic at their first real code.  These are ADULTS who have gone through 4years of study and clinicals before they ever got to an ICU floor. \n\nTo expect a child to see a parent collapse and not panic is insane.  You or your father should have arranged an adult family member, friend, neighbour, church or community outreach to supervise if he was unable to be left alone.  The only thing your 14 year old sister should have been responsible for is getting him drinks, or food.  \n\nI am very sorry that you have lost your dad, but blaming your sister is inappropriate, and I am hoping that both you and your sister can get some therapy to help you recover.", "YTA. Why would you put that on her head. She. Is. 14.   She had no business being a healthcare provider and it\u2019s bullshit to put her in that position.  She wasn\u2019t a parent, not an adult, and should be expected to be a kid.", "YTA  - If you've had a CPR class, you know that you, or anyone, only performs CPR on a dead person (their heart has stopped = they are  dead.) \n\nYour sister did not kill your father.", "My dad died from a heart attack. My mom is +60 years and totally panicked. She didn't do what you are supposed to do in that situation. Could he have lived? \nWe dont know. He died. She called for help and an ambulance came, but it wasnt really the fastest. She was alone with him. \n\nWould i ever mention she didn't do it right? \nHell no! Her husband through 43 years died. I lost my dad, yes. But she is way more traumatized than me. We all grieve, but it doesn't help putting blame on the person who went through that trauma. \n\nYour sister is 14 years old. She should not have been responsible for looking after your sick dad. \nThis is not the time to put anymore trauma on her. This will follow her the rest of her life and you are not helping or in the right. \nSupport each other.

She should have never been in charge of looking after him, period. She's a kid. Do you have any idea how traumatic it is to give cpr to a loved one? It's horrific. I did it 3 years ago on my son's friend, and despite the fact that I am an adult and trained in cpr, it still traumatized me. Also, you have no idea if he would have survived even if she immediately gave cpr. Stop blaming her. Your family should have been paying for home health care to monitor him if he was that bad off. I get that you're angry, but putting that anger on a 14yo is just wrong.", "YTA. Do you know why health professionals don\u2019t treat their loved ones? Because the stress and upset means they CANNOT cope. Your 14 (FOURTEEN!!!) year old sister is not a professional. She panicked. Of course she did. Anyone would! She did the best she could by calling you. And you DARE to blame her for your father\u2019s death?! She will never forget that and I hope she never forgives you for this abuse of her.", "YTA\n\nA mayor one too.\n\nYou were incredibly in the wrong saying that to her and that was not an attempt at calming her down. A 14 year old child should not even have been left in that position!", "YTA\n\nDo you even realize how much that is going to stick with your sister? She's already traumatized by the fact that she found her dad on the ground and you just made it worse. \n\nEven if she did try to preform CPR, she wouldn't have had 8 minutes to bring him back from cardiac arrest. 8 minutes is not a lot of time and you blaming your sister is cruel.

And not put a kid in charge of some one who is really sick.", "She's 14 and you want to blame her??  No .    So, YTA", "YTA. She's 14. She's a child. It was far too much to put on her. How could you expect her to stay calm and not freak out when this happened given she is a child?

I don\u2019t know your background, but unexpected deaths, in my life, caused people I knew to react angrily and say things they regretted or didn\u2019t understand how painful they were.  \n\nYour sister is still young, and panicked.  Deep down you know she\u2019s not to blame; and I doubt your father would see it that way.", "Firstly, I\u2019m so sorry for you and your sister\u2019s loss; it was very traumatic and a painful experience for you both to go through. \n\nHowever, I have to agree with your Aunt, you are TA in this situation. \nYou are struggling to cope with the loss of your father as an adult, imagine how a 14 year old is coping?\n\nLeaving responsibility for your father\u2019s complex medical care to your 14 yr old sister, is a huge undertaking for them. Even if they had been told what to do in an emergency- being told and then having to actually act when your father is dying in front of them is very different. \n\nYour sister is 14 and will forever blame themselves for what happened- even though it is likely that your dad would have passed anyway due to the seriousness of his conditions. \n\nYou are projecting your grief and anger towards an innocent child who was in a situation that the majority of adults (let alone kids) would struggle to cope with. \n\nYou and your sister need grief counselling and therapy- both independently and as a family to start to process the grief and anger you\u2019re feeling.", "YTA - I understand you are both upset, but your response was both horrifying and traumatizing for your sister. There's a chance nothing she did would have helped save his life. There is no blame here, yet you let your feelings get the better of you. You need to sincerely apologize to her, and let her know your grief got the best of you.\n\nCondolences on your loss.", "YTA! She is 14 years old! Why scare a literal child because you don\u2019t no how to deal with your emotions. My sister and I are in our 20\u2019s rn and she\u2019s a nurse, I STILL WOULDNT BLAME HER IF SHE WAS WATCHING MY FATHER AND HE DIED! You did so much harm to your sister and I hope you are prepared for the fall out of that.", "Oh wow yeah YTA. Your sister is a child and not qualified to be taking care of a sick adult. Be mad at the system that put the two of you in this position, not the 14 year old who was just trying her best. I hope the two of you are able to get some healing and peace.", "Dude you\u2019re the ass hole. She\u2019s a kid, already being expected to do things that kids should not have to do. Why not hire an at home nurse or put your father in a facility where he could have around the clock care? I know that you\u2019re in pain and grieving but that is not an excuse for blaming your sister for a horrible tragedy. \n\nShe\u2019s going to live with those word you told her for the rest of her life.", "YTA FFS! You just broke your sister forever! What the hell? Why would you do that to a child? Even if she found him in the spot he would probably still have died. You as an adult could have done so much better like a fucking Apple Watch. You are the asshole and I am sorry your sister had to go through that.", "It seems OP cant except that she is the asshole seeing the comments... shame, real shame. YTA", "YTA to an extreme. You're in the TOP AH of reddit and I've been a reddit lurker for years. \n\nShe IS a child.

She is 14, so still a child and it\u2019s really hard even with all the training sometimes to do the right and proper thing.", "YTA. A 14 y/o is not capable of responding to a situation like this. Hell, most adults aren\u2019t capable of acting well in these situations. It\u2019s why not everyone is able to be a nurse, doctor, or emergency responder. You\u2019ve put far too much onto a child.

You are horrible. How can you blame your sister for not staying calm and rational when you yourself were irrationally angry and anything but calm? Shame on you.

EMTs told me he was long gone before I even entered and found him. Unless your sister entered RIGHT when your father collapsed, there was a 0.0% of saving him. Even if she did, it's never a guarantee/given that it'll work.   \n\n\nI'm not going to absolutely pile on you like the other comments are. You lost your father, in a situation that YOU feel you could have prevented if you were there, which is likely NOT the case either. I feel you're projecting the anger of not having been there yourself onto your sister, if I'm to venture as to why you reacted so angrily.   \n\n\nYour sister will remember this for the rest of her life as vividly as when it first happened. The scenario, ALONG WITH YOUR WORDS, will haunt her forever.   \n\n\nYou have some work to do to rebuild your relationship with her now, but more importantly you both need professional help to process this in a healthy way. Please don't underestimate the power PTSD can have on a 14-year old. It's life-ruining.   \n\n\nI won't call you an AH, nor will I call your sister or even your aunt it.

Please seek help.", "YTA, the child panicked and if it took that long for the ambulance to arrive anyway even with CPR (which a 14 year old girl is probably not strong enough to do properly on a full grown man for long enough) the chances of surviving were likely south of 5% (unless you get an AED on someone fast CPR alone does not save many people at all). You should have told her to try and stay calm, run to find an adult (say a neighbour) and then stay with him, BOTH try and call an ambulance and to do her best to monitor his breathing. You could even have explained CPR to her down the phone or if you'd got her to call the ambulance they'd have told her how.\n\nInstead you let her panic, and am now blaming her when he almost certainly would have died anyway, when anyone with any sense should know leaving a 14 year old doing medical care for a man in his 60s including possible resuscitation would likely not end well (bills to pay or not).\n\nYTA", "YTA - your sister is an actual child. She was left in a situation providing care to a sick and elderly man and she was NOT equipped to do so. It was extremely irresponsible for everyone involved to leave a CHILD in charge of a sick old man all day every day.", "YTA. It was NOT your sister's fault and you need to quit saying this. She panicked; grown adults panic and make the wrong call sometimes. Even if she had called an ambulance and managed some cpr, given it was a cardiac arrest he was still unlikely to survive. \n\nA 14 year old child should not be expected to care for a seriously ill adult. I feel so, so bad for that kid. She did her best and her big sister is being absolutely horrible to her.", "YTA. This is awful. You need to apologize & let your sister know it was NOT her fault. She's a kid.", "You need to go undo this asap and tell your sister it wasn\u2019t her fault. She should not carry your emotional outburst for the rest of her life. Your dad was sick. She is a CHILD.

She did the best she could in the situation. And secondly, there is absolutely no guarantee that the ambulance getting there 2 minutes sooner would have helped. Your father was very ill and while it's tragic, it was only a. matter of time before he was going to pass...", "Wow YTA not only is she 14 and should never have been left with full responsibility for your father's health needs, I've known qualified nurses panic when family members go into a health crisis. When my mum was sick when I was in my 30s I was terrified. Apologise and spend the rest of your life making it up to your 14 year old sister. Disgraceful behaviour on your part", "Honestly, it sounds like OP was forced to grow up far too young and take responsibility for her entire family at such a young age. She probably has some resentment over having to struggle so much to keep a roof over their heads, whereas her sister was able to have a bit less pressure and responsibility, with her only responsibility being to look after the dad, which, in comparison to OP, probably feels like not that big of deal. Yes, it\u2019s wrong, and in reality neither of these girls should have had to carry these kinds of burdens so young, but I can see why OP is struggling to understand why her sister couldn\u2019t do the *one* thing that was expected of her, when at a similar age OP was forced to step up and carry the entire family on her shoulders. People in the comments are being unnecessarily harsh - I don\u2019t think OP is a monster. Yes, she was cruel to her younger sister, but I think it comes from years of struggle and resentment, mingled with her current grief. It sounds like OP needs therapy to deal with all of the emotions and trauma she was forced to repress for years in order to keep a roof over her family\u2019s heads.", "I know you\u2019re in a tough spot, but you\u2019re an absolute complete asshole. Coming from a doctor, the chance that your father would\u2019ve survived even if she had called 911 and started CPR are incredibly small to nonexistent. She\u2019s 14, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll be able to do proper CPR on a grown man. Even if she were able to do that, the chance is still really small. Also, who knows how long he was anoxic for? Even if they resuscitated him he might\u2019ve been in a vegetative state. You\u2019re blaming your sister for something she had no power to change, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be traumatized and resent you forever.", "I'm so sorry for your loss, but YTA.   Not the devil, though.  Definitely not that.  Your aunt went way too far. \n\nYou're in pain and because of this, you're looking for someone to blame -- consciously or unconsciously.  Your sister is an easy target.  But you have to stop.   \n\nHe was already unconscious when she found him; it might already have been too late to revive him. Even if she had begun CPR immediately, there is no guarantee that it would have been effective in saving his life. \n\nMoreover, she's only 14.  Not all teenage brains are able to respond to stress in a calm way. She did the best she could in the moment. You can't ask more of her.  Also, there's no guarantee that you would have responded better if you had been in her shoes. You weren't there. Even if you had been there and commenced CPR immediately, there's no guarantee that your actions would have saved his life. \n\nI am so sorry for the pain you're feeling, and for the heavy burden of responsibility that you both were carrying before he passed.  My heart aches for you both. But you have to apologize to your sister and you have to stop blaming her. As soon as possible.", "Good. I'm glad that stuck with you and I hope it'll stick with you for the same amount of time your words will stick with your sister. I hope those words will affect your life as much as your words will affect hers. You traumatized your sister, who is a child, for no reason what so ever. Your father's death is quite literally not her fault.

It\u2019s barely legal for her to stay home without supervision, let alone supervise a sick person. She was traumatised by finding her dad on the floor but you scared her for life by blaming her. She probably won\u2019t ever be able to fully let go of the guilt she feels and she will need YEARS of therapy to overcome what you have just caused her. She panicked because she found her dad unconscious. You panicked and got angry and blamed it all on her. \nTHIS IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST AND BIGGEST YTA.

YTA.", "I am very sorry for your loss OP.\n\nYou probably won't see this comment but I want you to know that you need stop for a moment and think, because what I am getting from your post and replies is that your life has been quite tough. You mentioned working since you were 16 to provide for your family, working 16h a day and having no support system at all. Which sucks completely. You were likely parentified and seeing all the things you are doing and had to do since a young age, you're probably thinking something like \"you had only one job, your situation is better than mine at (more or less) your age\". The problem is that neither you nor your sister should have been in your respective positions. You shouldn't have been parentified, you shouldn't experience burnout to provide the basics and she shouldn't be responsible for someone's life at the age of 14. Because no matter the task, when someone is dying, people panic.\n\nNow take a breath for a second. It's just you and your sister now. She's your only family and you told her that she killed your dad. This is terrible, but its also the result of a terrible situation. Because it's not your fault, nor her fault. Bad things just happens and while you spend your time thinking \"what if\" while looking at your sister I want you to keep in mind that things could have been different if the healthcare system provided proper aid for your dad, or you weren't forced to work 16h a day just to provide for your family, if the incident happened near a hospital, or things could have just ended the same way despite all the above. It's human nature to look for something to blame, but rationally there isn't always a villain in the story and bad things just happen.\n\nDon't spend your time resenting your sister for having a human reaction, but try to understand how you ended up in such a bad place that your first reaction was to tell her she killed your dad. Seek professional help, try to find a way to make your own life easier, especially now that it's just the two of you. \n\nI really wish both you and your sister will be able to heal and reconcile. Best of luck OP.", "YTA My cousin\u2019s husband was in the hospital for what was technically heart surgery, but a minor procedure.

He died in that surgery. Her last conversation with her father was her refusing to speak with him and not nicely either. A 13 year old doesn\u2019t understand risk the way adults do. They don\u2019t understand how fast people are here and then gone. No one blamed her, no one called her out. When she brings it up herself, we all tell her the truth - her father loved her no matter what and one conversation, unthinking words spoken in haste, could never change that. \n\nYour sister is a child who was left in a situation too big for her to handle. You might as well blame yourself for not being at home with him, except that no one is to blame at all.

You make me sick.", "Ok, this was a heavy one. You are wrong in this situation for yelling at your sister because she will probably be blaming herself, rationally or not, for a long time. She is wrong because she should have been listening to you and paying attention when you tried to train her on what to do.\n\nBut really, neither of you are AHs, you\u2019re both victims in a shitty and now tragic situation. There\u2019s a reason 14 year olds aren\u2019t usually trusted to handle critical situations, it\u2019s that they\u2019re not mature or wise enough to handle that responsibility, and they\u2019re really bad at it. Even if your sister had been prepared in theory there\u2019s a chance she would have flubbed it in her panic. Or it could have just been your dad\u2019s time to go.\n\nBut OP, I feel worst of all for you, and not just because of your dad\u2019s passing. You have no one to support you in any sense. If you started working to support the family at 16, you\u2019ve been the family breadwinner for about 8 years now. Since you yourself were a kid. That\u2019s parentification, which this sub has a lot of strong feelings about. You have been paying all the bills and taking care of everything. That\u2019s way too much on your shoulders. Where is everyone else in your family in all this? I know you have at least one aunt around. Why isn\u2019t anyone helping you? \n\nI guess one of the things that really bothers me about parentification is that a lot of times, after a while, the people involved all begin to see it as normal. You\u2019ve been the \u201cadult\u201d for so long you don\u2019t see anything wrong with giving your sister adult level responsibilities, and **that\u2019s** why you\u2019re angry at her for handling that day so badly. You see her as an adult that screwed up, not a kid that panicked. \n\nI hope you two will be able to lean on each other in life and be kind to each other.

He died due to a medical crisis I couldn't handle because, ya know, I was 13 and not a medical professional. My family then blamed me for his death. That's part of the reason why I haven't talked to my mom's family in almost a decade.

I know adults, grown ass well in their 40s adults, that would react so much worse than your sister did, and you are putting the blame on a CHILD?! it doesn't matter how you instructed her to act, no reasonable person would expect a kid to be on top of their emotions to handle such a severe thing. that's something you expect from trained professionals like firefighters and doctors, not random people and even less kids. \n\nyou're a major, gigantic asshole. and it doesn't matter how many hours you work per day, it doesn't justify you traumatizing a child for something that was no one's fault.

Your family living far away is their excuse for their lack of action when you were 16 and needed them to step in and find a way to help. As a child, you had work with no help to find any services. Even as an adult, working 16 hours a day to pay the bills leaves no time to locate services even if you know about them. Please hold your sister close, forgive her and yourself.

I can tell this because she didn\u2019t do nothing on finding your father: she called the person she trusted fix things. The person her last little bit of childhood magical thinking, in the midst of absolute panic & horror, told her would somehow make it better. \n\nThere are countries where 911 will connect you to the emergency services because people forget what number to call but remember the one from US films & TV shows. People frequently can\u2019t manage to remember their own address to give to the call handler; they forget close relatives\u2019 ages & health conditions & generally fall to pieces. You do get the odd very composed toddler who can reliably call an ambulance for their primary carer whose health needs necessitate this; but they are the rule-proving exception when it comes to children calling ambulances for parents. \n\nAs lots of other posters have said, but I think it bears repeating: even if your sister had called the emergency services while starting CPR there\u2019s pretty much no chance your father would have survived. He may already have been gone for some time when she found him; & even if she witnessed the collapse she wouldn\u2019t be physically able to do effective CPR until the ambulance arrived. \n\nMisplaced anger is normal & understandable; but what you said will be causing serious harm to your sister.

You\u2019re literally having to force the front of the rib cage to the spine in order to squeeze the heart. Forcing a body part do exactly what it\u2019s designed NOT TO DO!!! That takes enormous strength & stamina. She\u2019s 14! Was your father already on the floor? If not she\u2019d have had to get him onto the floor (no good trying to do it on a mattress/bed).
