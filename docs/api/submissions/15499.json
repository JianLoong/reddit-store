We are good friends, we just have been drafting away recently because our lives are too different. She got married and I am happy for her because that's something she wanted, her husband also is a good man and that's nice, I was her bridesmaid and celebrated her even though I'm not a big wedding person because obviously that was about supporting a friend and not about me.\n\nNow she's pregnant (around five months) and I'm also happy for her, she's very excited to be a mom. I'm not a person who likes kids or wants them to myself, however I can be happy for the people around me who want them, I'm not one of those bitter childfree people who hate kids/ parents. \n\nHer family lives a few hours away so she often asks me to go with her to appointments if her husband can't or to do something like that. I am happy to help her out and I don't mind it. I also am happy to know that everything's ok with the pregnancy and her child, it's ok if she wants to talk every once in a while about that or about something they brought for the baby, etc. I can tolerate that. However she wants to talk about her pregnancy/ baby all the time we're together. \n\nI think she's testing my patience or something. Everytime I try to talk about something else she somehow turns the conversation to her pregnancy, its irritating. Like we could be talking about work and she turns the conversation about her maternity leave or something. Or we could be talking about something personal to me and she would tell me something regarding marriage and \"when you're a mom\" or stuff like that, it's annoying. \n\nYesterday I was having a bad day, honestly I had a bad week because I broke with my boyfriend and I had to work on Saturday, I was tired and just wasn't in a good mood. We already had plans to have dinner together so as did not felt like going out I invited her to my house and we ordered take away. \n\nWe ate and were talking afterwards. I was just ranting about life to her and such. And then she somehow turns the conversation again to her pregnancy. She started telling me about her back hurting and how she felt the baby kicking and such. She went on like that for like 10 minutes until I got tired of it and I told her so. I said \"I don't care much about pregnancies, can we take about something else?\" She was very angry and she told me she was telling me about something important to her, I told her that it's only important to her, I don't care to know every single detail of her pregnancy, and we can find something else to talk just for once. She got more upset and called me an asshole and a bad friend. We argued and then she left. Now she's angry and doesn't answer my texts. AITA? I feel like I acted wrong but she also is tiring with just talking about the pregnancy all the time and I snapped.\n\n\nEdit: I broke off with my boyfriend because we had been talking about marriage and kids, he wants them and I don't so it was a deal breaker for him. My friend knows this, she knows this was a big issue for us and she tells me all the time that I'll change my mind about kids sooner or later.

It seems like your friend doesn't realize how much space they're letting their pregnancy take up space in your conversations and she's being a bad friend to you. Truly not everything is about her pregnancy. While this is her whole life right now, it shouldn't completely define your friendship, and she should be able to have the self awareness to understand that when you need support for the big things in your life she give you ample time. It sounds like you were dealing with this frustration for a while, and didn't mention it earlier, and it came out in a moment of anger. It happens. I would try to reach out and explain you obviously care about her pregnancy and understand it's a huge thing going on in her life, but also express your feelings about still needing support and attention and acknowledgement about the big things going on your life. If she doesn't get it after that, maybe not immediately but with some time, then just give her space. Unforchunately some people when they have kids become very self centered, talk only of their children, and forget how to be good friends to the people in their lives. She might be one of them. If she can't figure out that her pregnancy should not be the center of every conversation, then she's definitely going to be talking non stop about her kids and being a mom and it will just be exhausting and create a wedge. Good luck, and also you sound like a good friend. Hang in there.", "NTA This is the exact reason why many new moms lose their adult friends. Because they refuse to understand that people don't want to talk about their fucking kid 24 hours a day.", "NTA, it\u2019s normal to witness people talk about their achievements, but not make it their whole personality. She surely knows you don\u2019t like children and she could have been more considerate when choosing which topic to bring up. It\u2019s good that you let her know.", "NTA but I would\u2019ve said it differently. Like hey we talk about your pregnancy a lot and I\u2019m at capacity right now to hear about it. I\u2019m having a hard week, can I share my problems. If you can\u2019t handle my issues that\u2019s fine, but then I need some space. Or something like that", "NTA, you really need to edit your post though so everyone knows you stance on pregnancy. shes been dragging you abou tin hopes that it changes your mind so you will have a kid and be in the same boat as her", "NTA\n\nYou've been there for months when she needed you, and the one day you were the one who needed her she just kept making it about her baby.\n\nSome expectant moms make their entire life about being a mom and become a much different person than they were for the purposes of being their friend. There's nothing objectively wrong with that, but you and your friend may not have the connection anymore that made for your friendship to be as strong as it was.", "NAH, It\u2019s obviously a huge milestone for her so good for your friend, however you got to remember she\u2019s quite literally going through a huge change with new hormones being produced in preparation to carry this baby along with the eventual delivery so it\u2019s not entirely her fault", "INFO: Was this the first time she felt the baby kicking? \n\nBecause I can understand her wish to share if it was the first time she experienced the feeling, but under the circumstances... She clearly thought you intended to have kids, given her 'when you are a mom' comments, but if that were the case her pregnancy talk could have been even more insensitive given your break-up.", "NTA for feeling like that, maybe soft TA for how you phrased it. It sounded like you hate talking about it and were just taked allong. Which can be horrifying when she braught you to her appointments. She gave you a full insight few about what happens to her - trusted you and the way you phrased it, sounds like you never liked anything of that, never found it important and so on.\n\nBut I very much get your point. Of corse you have other important topics to talk about. You have your life and as you said, you had a bad day. You wanted to tal about things that are important to you! And a friendship should have the possible to talk about both.\n\nINFO: was she always like that, just wanting to tal about her stuff and ignoring yours? If not, it could be pregnancy brain. Her situation can be difficulty and so she migth only be thining about bringing new live into the world. Appologice in this case for your phrasing. You didn't ment that you are absolutly not interested in her pregnancy, but that you still see her not only as a mother to be but also as your friend, as a person by herself. And at that night (or at some nights) you just want to talk about other things, you things and also her things (work, hobbies, movies) but not only about her pregnancy.", "Nta. Ppl tend to get super consumed with their lives and forget about the lives of others.", "NTA", "NAH this was clearly not the day for the two of you to meet up. She's emotional due to her pregnancy and you due to your break up.\nI think maybe your delivery was a bit too much, but I don't think either of you were ready to listen. \nTake some time apart, then try talking it out. I'm sure it will work itself out. But be firm, tell her that you might not be the person to \"pregnancy rant\" at.", "NTA", "NTA since she\u2019s doing this is to get you to change your mind abt kids for yourself", "NTA. Your friend lacks basic empathy and sounds self-centered.", "NAH.  All pregnant women can think about is their pregnancy.  It permeates every aspect of their lives.  Especially their first pregnancy.  Give her some grace for that.  It's just how it is.  You could have handled your message better for sure.  Maybe, when the dust settles she will dial it back a bit knowing how your feel about the subject...  You are on two different paths and it seems like there may not be enough in common to maintain a close friendship.", "NAH. Like you said, you\u2019re at different milestones in your life. Pregnancy is literally the only major thing happening to her right now and it\u2019s a pretty significant thing. It impacts literally everything in your life. \n\nI think you could\u2019ve been softer in your delivery but maybe she doesn\u2019t realise how much she\u2019s talking about it. Maybe you just need to communicate with each other better.", "YTA\n\n  I couldn't move past the part where you keep expecting applause for celebrating her wedding and being happy for her pregnancy. \n\n>that was about supporting a friend and not about me\n\n And yet you made it about you by congratulating yourself. \n\n>however I can be happy for the people around me who want them, I'm not one of those bitter childfree people who hate kids/ parents. \n\n I can't even on this....", "YTA\n\nYou know you didn't need to be that callous. It's fine to say nicely that you'd like to change the subject, but you were rude.", "[deleted]", "I got to admit I rolled my eyes at your \"I'm not like those bitter cf people\" like the childfree version of I'm not like the other girls.\n\nOverall.... not wrong for the sentiment but your delivery SUCKED.", "YTA, but only because you let this go on for so long without speaking up and then just exploded at her. For her this must have seemed out of nowhere, and because of the size of your explosion she\u2019s going to feel like she can\u2019t come to you for any of this at all. That\u2019s going to leave her feeling lost and abandoned, and like she has to walk on eggshells.\n\nYou need to sit down with her ASAP and have an adult conversation about how you love being there for her, you\u2019re happy about the baby, and that you understand how important this whole thing is, but that you worry she\u2019s not leaving room for the other things that make her such an awesome person. Tell her you\u2019re worried about her losing herself, and remind her that your life hasn\u2019t been put on pause while she\u2019s dealing with this and you could also use some support.", "YTA. This is your friend, and it's a massively life-changing event for her. \n\nIf you had a major life change, and wanted to talk about it with your friend, how would you feel if they blatantly told you \"I don't really care about this?\"", "YTA. You were rude and straight up mean to a friend who is going through an ongoing process of bodily and emotional change. That is all she's probably thinking about right now, because it can be all-consuming. Her life will change constantly from this point forward, and if you can't be there for her now, or communicate with maturity, the friendship is probably done.", "NTA, however, there are some introspective steps you could take, to look more from the outside perspective.There is nothing wrong with communicating that your main topics are too focused on the friend's pregnancy, you could do it more delicately, but considering your current situation the friend should understand and give you more time to vent, and not go into: who has it worse match.However, there can be confirmation bias from your side, and you are too overfocused every time the topic comes out. I am not saying that is the case, but  I would play a little bit of a devil's advocate, and try to defend your friend in your head. Look if really all your conversations were mainly focused on that with more good-willed eyes. Maybe talk to someone and speak out loud both sides and if the verdict will be still that your friend is just selfish right now, well. You have every right to feel neglected and sad. You can also give more examples here to clear your mind.Some people got a baby fever too much, and it is really irritating. I hope you will be able to communicate your needs with the friend in a calmer manner, and she will be able to look at you and your perspective.But you are not an asshole for sure, it is just an argument, where both sides were hurt. I think your friend overreacted, but still, gotta talk it out. But do not worry, I think almost everyone can relate when someone is pregnant, and they have like: I am the center of the world, and my baby also, time. It is not always the case, but well... I feel ya, to have to endure it.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Her pregnancy is probably a big deal to her and something she talks about because it's something she constantly thinks about. It's a huge life change, and you're not being a supportive friend by blowing up on her out of the blue for it. \n\nEDIT: For those downvoting, make sure you read the post. OP literally told her friend \"I don't care about pregnancies.\" Why do you guys think it's okay to say that to your pregnant friend? That's definitely an AH move. OP has a right to be annoyed all their conversations go back to her friend's pregnancy, but there's a right and a wrong way to address this. OP is an asshole for saying this to her friend, because she's basically telling her friend she doesn't care about her pregnancy. She also said that the pregnancy was something that was only important to her friend, not to OP.", "Yta \n\nGo apologize. And talk to her like an adult.", "YTA being pregnant is kinda a really big deal. You could have handled this so much better. Maybe learn to have more respectful and open communication instead of waiting until the situation blows up.", "NTA for feeling this way but you were kind of rude soooo soft YTA for your choice of words.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But instead you told her you didn't want to talk about something that was important to her. If you already saw your lives drifting apart, let it.

In my opinion.\n\nYour friend is pregnant and is oversharing/clouded by her pregnancy. That\u2019s pretty normal, but it can be annoying.

It\u2019s kinda hard because because it wasn\u2019t my whole identity, but it\u2019s was new, exciting, and very very in MY face.

I think your description makes the friend sound like the AH, but I know how this stage of life goes and what it's like to be pregnant.

People like myself started actively dodging her, and if she tried to come to my desk to talk, I started telling her to go sit down. \n\nThe funny thing is that right after she got pregnant, three other women in our office did, too.

I think you're 100% correct that her friend is definitely allowed to share stuff about her relationship and life, and OP might have even been eagerly anticipating hearing about the friend's life, but is trying to communicate that she has gotten tired of hearing about the same aspect of the friend's life for the past several months. From the post, the friend's pregnancy has been a major topic of conversation in (virtually and possibly actually) every conversation they've had for several months. I do take your point that \"I don't care much about pregnancies\" probably made the friend defensive, though if OP just got finished saying she broke up with her boyfriend because she doesn't want to have kids, it's also surprising that the friend would think OP was in the mood to discuss her pregnancy right then. It sounds like the friend stopped listening though, as they didn't appear to respond to the \"can we talk about something else?\" part.\n\nTo your point about a conversation going a long way, I think it's very possible OP thought a conversation wasn't necessary in this instance (since it's one night, not forever) and was expecting something like:\n\n\"I don't care much about pregnancies, can we talk about something else?\" \"Okay. How about you tell me about \\[insert non-pregnancy topic\\]?\"\n\nOr, if the friend didn't move to a new topic, something like: \"Actually, that's all that is on my mind. My back hurts, my feet are swollen and I've been trying to pick a nursery color all week.\" \"Yeah, I know how excited you are about this. I've been happy to see you so ecstatic about it and hear how it's been going over the past few months. Frankly though, after breaking up with BF over kids, it's the last topic I want to talk about tonight. How about we talk about...\\[insert non-pregnancy topic\\]\"\n\nIt could have been \"Whether or not you like massages. The next vacation you'd like to take. Your father's ongoing battle with their next-door neighbor about a tree branch hanging over the fence. The shows you're watching.

Like we could be talking about work and she turns the conversation about her maternity leave or something. Or we could be talking about something personal to me and she would tell me something regarding marriage and \"when you're a mom\" or stuff like that, it's annoying. \n\nThat's right from the post. When OP would try to discuss other topics, the conversation was always forcibly turned to her friend's pregnancy while also ignoring OP's child free stance.", "Being fine with talking about pregnancy some of the time (especially in a relevant situation like going to appointments) doesn't mean you're fine with talking about it in every single conversation.

What I said was when you become a parent and expect everyone to prioritize your choice while not making their choices your priorities, it\u2019s selfish and can cause you to lose friends. Doing the bare minimum while asking for the maximum isn\u2019t what friendship is built on and that\u2019s the problem.\n\nRemember I didn\u2019t say anything about birthdays and holidays. That\u2019s the bare minimum. What major milestone have you actively celebrated for your Childfree friend? Did she get a degree, did she win a case, did she get a promotion, did she get a boob job.

No one could have prepared me for the sudden jolt my lifestyle took after having my first baby. It\u2019s like you wake up one day and your life has completely changed.

It started to seem like anytime she wanted to catch up she never wanted my son around and always wanted him left at home with my partner. I did it once and i just felt off about the whole experience everytime we spoke ECT. \n\nI think friendships like this just don't work if both parties can't bring each other to understand how the other would feel.

That you broke up with your boyfriend over your not wanting children probably pushed her buttons.  You were strongly bothered that your guy made that a deal breaker while she, your friend, saw that as normal.  You will change your mind one day, she believes.  That further speaks to the conviction of many that you can\u2019t possibly justify your existence if you don\u2019t become a mom, and that you can\u2019t hope a man you love will love you back unless you have his children.  \n\nSomething to hang onto is that many women who have children also read a book now and then, enjoy a loving relationship with their spouses, and continue to have a variety of interests in life.  \n\nWhen i became a mom, it drove me bonkers to be around other moms who never thought of anything other than being moms. The friendships I formed were sometimes with moms and those who weren\u2019t and of those that had kids.

It's just that some people don't. get. hints.

Sometimes, tbh, it's just about different/changing interests and logistics.\n\nIt's harder for new parents to go out to dinners and parties and go clubbing etc. There's a lot of planning around kids. Kid needs a nap, kid needs to be picked up from daycare, kid needs  to be put down to sleep early in the evening, etc. Some parents also move outside the city to have more space, which means the friends are further away. If you don't have a babysitter, it's harder to do things. Even have a uninterrupted conversation.\n\nYou might still want to see your old friends, but it just can't happen so often, so you drift apart. Then the parents starts talking with other parents from their kid's play group/daycare/kindergarten/school - people who have kids the same age, have the same struggles, the same schedule and who live closer. You just click, and you talk about both kids and other things.

I don't remotely dispute that it's aggravating from outside, but it's also not necessarily intentional and can be hard for parents as well. Anyone's points of reference in conversation are often what they do and think about every day, and for parents that is largely their child(ren). It's exhausting in conversation to be constantly thinking of related things and having to filter out 'oh have I mentioned my kids too many times an I being annoying, is that interesting in general or just cos they're my kids' etc. \n\nNAH to me, OPs words came out harsh but a sincere apology and open communication can hopefully fix it.

It's almost like having kids is a massive undertaking that completely alters your life and consumes your time that you previously had for hobbies or meeting people.

Even at the early stages, there are constant physical reminders of your pregnancy, and that's not to even mention the aspect of going into planning mode as you prepare to bring a human into this world that you will be fully responsible for for a minimum of 18 years.\n\nWhen you have an infant, you need to constantly be watching them because they can't do a damn thing for themselves. You're constantly operating around your baby's schedule, when they eat, when they sleep and wake up, when they nap. You can't go anywhere for the first few months, eventually you can leave them with someone you trust, but you're still gonna be thinking about them, because you're ALWAYS thinking about them normally. That's not a switch you can just turn off. You're also hyperfocused on their development. Are they hitting their developmental milestones? Are they healthy? You watch this helpless little thing start to figure out the world, get control over their body, go from sedentary to crawling to walking, from silent to talking. I don't think CF people fully get how exciting the developmental process is for a parent, or how invested a person can get in it, but people who aren't lacking in basic empathy understand that it's important to them.\n\nAs they get older, start going to school now it's all about their schedule, where they need to be, now there's grades, extracurriculars, you're watching to again make sure that they're on track, learning to read and write and all that jazz. The point is, children are a massive part of your life that take up your time and are always on your mind. Once you have a child, the most exciting part of your week is probably something they did. It is a massive life change. You can't just compare it to shit like someone making their whole personality about liking football. If you can't get on board with parents talking about being parents a lot, because they really don't have much else to talk about, there's nothing wrong with that. They're living a completely different life to you. But they are not inherently selfish for that.

The friend hasn\u2019t noticed at all that this topic might have been sensitive considering the cause of the breakup and I think while OP handled this entirely wrong, the friend was also being a garbage friend by paying zero attention to OP\u2019s emotional state. \n\nOh and I\u2019m referring to OP mentioning that the friend would pretty constantly be making comments that OP will change their mind etc etc. The friend talking about her pregnancy alone is annoying but not super problematic. If it wasn\u2019t for those other comments I\u2019d be entirely with you in YTA territory.", "If you had a good relationship with your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner and broke up because of the fact you had different stances on having children or not of course it's going to hurt to hear about pregnancy so often especially if the breakups recent. It'll just remind you of the breakup and still hurt as yes breakups hurt regardless of how it ended.", "I have had multiple friends be pregnant. Not a single one felt the need to make every. single. conversation. about being pregnant. Not a one.", "It isn\u2019t even really about the pregnancy. It\u2019s about how incredibly self absorbed the pregnant friend is acting. Nobody is saying she should never bring it up but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her uterus and she\u2019s acting like it does. Maybe OP could have chosen better words, yes. But someone droning on and on about the same subject for months is going to get annoying no matter the topic. As others have said, she\u2019s just not reading the room and her friend is feeling ignored.", "I am not. It literally says in the post the friend has said OP will change her mind on not wanting marriage or kids and will often use the exact words \u201cwhen you\u2019re a mom\u2026\u201d when talking to OP about her own pregnancy. That is NOT the kind of shit you do to your friend who 1. Doesn\u2019t want kids 2. Has always supported you and 3. Is going through a FRESH breakup because of 1. Reread the post if that isn\u2019t at all clear to you, but it is directly in the main post, I\u2019m not making anything up or putting my own spin on anything.", "Her friend doesn't need to read her mind. It's called tact. Look that word up. All she needed was a bit of situational awareness and this entire issue wouldn't exist. As an example, imagine if someone got rejected from all the jobs they applied to and their friend, who got accepted to one of the jobs, kept bragging about it despite knowing that the first person didn't get in. The first person would then understandably get upset about it. The person who bragged is TA because they could've had some tact and not mentioned it around the person who didn't get the job. It's not hard to be considerate to those around you and OP HAS been considerate for the most part. It's just in this one instance where they weren't. I could understand if you said ESH, seeing as OP didn't have to snap at her, but you seem to only put blame on OP when that's not entirely true. Both people did something wrong, not just OP.", "\u201cMy boyfriend and I broke up because *I don\u2019t want kids*\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, anyway, let\u2019s talk about my pregnancy while you\u2019re saying your relationship ended because *you don\u2019t want one*, and I think you\u2019ll change your mind and want kids soon, it\u2019s the better choice!\u201d (As the friend\u2019s constantly telling OP she\u2019ll change her mind on kids)\n\n\u201cHonestly, I really don\u2019t care care much about pregnancies, can we talk about something else?\u201d (Because pregnancy was part of the reason her relationship JUST ended, and her so-called friend thinks is acceptable to constantly tell OP that her decision is wrong and that having children is obviously the better option)\n\nIt\u2019s common fucking sense that you don\u2019t start talking about a pregnancy when it\u2019s something that ended someone else\u2019s relationship in the same conversation as them ranting about it.", "No, if a person needs to be told that every conversation shouldn\u2019t centre on their experiences, they\u2019re a shitty, self absorbed friend and dare I say, a less than ideal role model for their child.", "someone happily doing something for you because they're your friend, doesn't mean you should have to be told that every conversation doesn't need to center on your experiences. the friend is selfish af and couldn't even let OP vent about her relationship JUST ONCE. and that's without getting into the constant \"when you're a mom\" invalidation when OP is cf.", "Honestly, I would be thrilled to join my best friend for appointments like this. And I would rather have her there with me than any of my family members, if my partners weren't available. I don't think it's that strange.", "You're one of those mothers whose children are their entire life and personality aren't you? In other words you're annoying as hell. She's obviously not jealous considering she broke up with her partner because he wanted children and he didn't? Yes, that totally screams jealousy of her friends pregnancy \ud83d\ude44", ">That being said her friend very much needs to learn to read the room.\n\nPeople keep saying this, but where is the evidence that OP was giving off any signs that she was tired of pregnancy talk? Nothing in OP's post shows she had done anything to indicate or hint to her friend she was tired of this. She was literally *taking her friend to her appointments*. She says she was tired of the talk for a while, but there's no evidence she ever communicated or tried to hint this to her friend. \n\nOP's friend might be able to read a room, but she can't read minds. Her friend seemed fine talking about pregnancy, until she randomly snapped about it one night. OP even says she snapped, and that she had had a terrible week and was moody. All of this makes it seem like OP was fine listening to her friend until this weekend, and then she bit her friend's head off out of the blue. That's not okay.\n\nAlso, OP throwing in that she had made comments about how she might change her mind does suck, but she never says this had anything to do with their convo. OP's friend was complaining about how her back was hurting, and OP responded with, \"I don't care about pregnancy,\" and told her that the pregnancy was only important to her friend. Who does that?\n\nOP should have been an adult and told her friend she was tired of pregnancy talk and wanted to talk about something else. She doesn't get a free pass to treat her friend like shit because she's annoyed.", "Finally! Someone with a rational answer. I can kind of see that being hard for OP when you put it that way. But then why is OP hanging out with her? If I went through a break up and I didn't want to be reminded about kids/pregnancies, I wouldn't choose to hang out with *a pregnant person.* It's not like she can switch off being pregnant. Even if she doesn't talk about being pregnant, it's not like she can hide that fact. If she's showing (at five months she probably is), it's going to be a reminder every time OP even looks at her.\n\nIn that case, I feel like OP is still the AH. She hung out with her pregnant friend and expected her to pretend she wasn't, and she snapped at her for it.", "It doesn't make someone an AH to want to talk about something that's happening to them, or is important to them. \n\nIf a friend constantly talked to me about how much they like flying paper airplanes and it's all they wanted to talk about, and I told them \"I don't care about your paper airplanes, those are only important to you,\" it would be an AH move. It's really dismissive and rude. That's not how you should treat your friends.", "EDIT: I found the line you're talking about.\n\nDo you really think it's okay for OP to snap at her friend and tell her that her pregnancy doesn't matter? OP says she snapped. Why is this okay? Nothing that her friend has said to OP has been rude. Even the \"when you're a mom\" line comes up, that's at best annoying but not something that her friend is saying to hurt her. \n\n\"I don't care about your pregnancy\" and telling your friend that their pregnancy isn't important to you is straight up mean. She said those things with the intention of hurting her friend.", "OP doesn't say they immediately changed the conversation away from them. It sounds like they got to vent about their life, and when their friend wanted to vent about *their* life, which is a natural back and forth in a conversation, they snapped at them. That's not cool. They also state in their post that they had a terrible week and were in an awful mood. It sounds like they took that out on their friend, instead of being an adult and telling their friend they were tired of pregnancy talk and wanted to discuss something else.", ">All she needed was a bit of situational awareness and this entire issue wouldn't exist.\n\nThat's just silly. OP gave no indication she was annoyed by the pregnancy talk. You're basically saying that all pregnant woman should inherently know that no one gives a shit about them or their babies. \n\nThat's also a huge double standard, because you're giving OP a free pass entirely. Where is her tact? Why shouldn't she be repsonsible for making rude remarks to her friend? That's pretty tactless to tell your friend you don't care about something that is important to them. \n\n>As an example, imagine if someone got rejected from all the jobs they applied to and their friend, who got accepted to one of the jobs, kept bragging about it despite knowing that the first person didn't get in.\n\nThis is not comparable at all. OP and her friend have not both been trying to get pregnant. OP's friend wants to be pregnant and is. OP does not. Why should it offend OP that her friend is pregnant? She's also not bragging about anything. She was literally complaining about her back hurting.", "None of what you wrote is even related to the post. This is not what OP's friend said during the conversation. She was complaining about how her back hurt and how she felt the baby kicking. NOWHERE in this conversation did she say that her friend was actively pressuring her to have kids.\n\nOP said she snapped at her friend, and she told her that her pregnancy was not important to her.", "OP's friend wasn't pressuring her about her choices or anything during this convo. She was literally complaining about her back pain. If OP was tired of hearing about her pregnancy, she should have said so. Instead, she told her friend her pregnancy doesn't matter. Who does that? Like in what realm is it okay to snap at anyone you care about and tell them you don't give a shit about something that's important to them? I don't care if they talk about it 24/7, putting someone down like that is an AH move. OP should have been better than that. Her friend did nothing malicious or mean spirited to her. Everything she said was meant to hurt.", "Reading comprehension... the read the room comment has almost nothing to do about too much pregnancy talk. 'The room' in this case is having a talk with a sad friend who just broke up with her significant other, over her not wanting kids. You don't need a degree in rocket science to realize that this might not be the best moment to be excited about having kids xD", "\u2026. Go reread the fourth paragraph of the post. It\u2019s literally right there, in quotes and all.", ">OP gave no indication she was annoyed by the pregnancy talk.\n\nOP's breakup was about having kids. Pregnancy is about having kids. I don't know why you can't understand that those two things are related. She shouldn't have brought it up. I really don't understand why you aren't understanding that.\n\n>You're basically saying that all pregnant woman should inherently know that no one gives a shit about them or their babies.\n\nI'm not saying anything like that. You're putting words in my mouth. I'm saying that in that situation she shouldn't have brought it up. I'm not talking about every other situation in their lives, just this one instance.\n\n>That's also a huge double standard, because you're giving OP a free pass entirely.\n\nYou completely ignored the fact that I said OP shouldn't have snapped at her and that they both did something wrong. I don't know if you're angry about the situation and that's causing you not to think of both sides but I'm telling you that they're both wrong. You're doing a wonderful job of analyzing what OP did wrong, but you're not analyzing what her friend did wrong at all.\n\n>Where is her tact? Why shouldn't she be repsonsible for making rude remarks to her friend?\n\nShe should. You're right about this. I agree.\n\n>This is not comparable at all. OP and her friend have not both been trying to get pregnant. OP's friend wants to be pregnant and is. OP does not.\n\nI think you are kind of right about this but not exactly. The situations aren't comparable because the goals and actions are different but they are the same emotionally. One person is ignoring the feelings of the other person and the other person is upset because of it. OP wanted her friend to help her emotionally and the friend said something that reminded her of what hurt her emotionally. In that regard it's the same as my hypothetical scenario. The friend said something that was an emotional trigger (although I hate to use that word) for OP. She should have known that the topic would be a sore one for OP because she had all the knowledge of OP's situation. Therefore it isn't something that requires mind reading.\n\n>Why should it offend OP that her friend is pregnant?\n\nIt doesn't offend her. That isn't the point, but I explained this already.\n\n>She's also not bragging about anything. She was literally complaining about her back hurting.\n\nThis is true but I also explained why the hypothetical situation isn't literally the exact same thing. It's a metaphor for the situation with the same moral lesson that one shouldn't talk about something they know is a sore topic for someone else.", "Her friend was not expressing her excitement. She was literally complaining about her back pain. I'm starting to think that no one actually read the entire post.", "Or just yet another pregnant woman who can't talk about anything else?", ">I do take your point that \"I don't care much about pregnancies\" probably made the friend defensive, though if OP just got finished saying she broke up with her boyfriend because she doesn't want to have kids, it's also surprising that the friend would think OP was in the mood to discuss her pregnancy right then. \n\nPlease explain to me why this would be offensive. I'm not being a dick, I'm not being obtuse, I genuinely don't get it. If OP doesn't want to have kids, why would someone talking about their pregnancy be triggering for them? I don't see the connection at all. They don't want kids, why would they then be a sore spot? I totally get it if OP wanted kids but was barren. 100% that would be wrong, but I just can't fathom how OP not wanting kids means she would be offended by her friend being pregnant. \n\n>To your point about a conversation going a long way, I think it's very possible OP thought a conversation wasn't necessary in this instance \n\nYou point out great hypotheticals, but none of those happened. OP was harsh to her friend. She told her that she didn't care about her pregnancy, and that it wasn't important to her. She is AH for this for sure. Like you shared, there are a lot of better ways she could have gone about it. She took the AH route, and she should apologize to her friend and address the issue.", "i\u2019m convinced that person is either the most oblivious person on east or the pregnant friend.", "This \"friend\" is the type of mombie that constantly posts shit on Facebook about how REAL fun is watching mind-numbing Disney pablum and going to sleep at 7:30 pm after a day of scrubbing vomit and spilled food out of the carpet rather than clubbing and sleeping with strangers (because those are the only two ways weekends look to these people), the next post is about how you aren't a REAL adult until you have kids, and the post after that is how being a parent shows you who your REAL friends are when nobody wants to come to your house for \"REAL fun\" and be told they're not a \"REAL adult\".", "Possibly~", "You *are* being obtuse. Someone who doesn't want kids also doesn't want to be pregnant - ever - not do they care to hear details about anyone else's pregnancy. She has no obligation to listen to the friend drone on and on about every aspect of her pregnancy in every conversation. Friend needs to get a clue and some social awareness and realize the world does not revolve around her pregnancy. And \"barren\"? Are you living in the 1800s?", "People did explain already. It\u2019s not an explanation issue, it\u2019s a comprehension issue.", "Okay, fair enough. I apologize for how aggressive I came at you."]}
