We are good friends, we just have been drafting away recently because our lives are too different. She got married and I am happy for her because that's something she wanted, her husband also is a good man and that's nice, I was her bridesmaid and celebrated her even though I'm not a big wedding person because obviously that was about supporting a friend and not about me.\n\nNow she's pregnant (around five months) and I'm also happy for her, she's very excited to be a mom. I'm not a person who likes kids or wants them to myself, however I can be happy for the people around me who want them, I'm not one of those bitter childfree people who hate kids/ parents. \n\nHer family lives a few hours away so she often asks me to go with her to appointments if her husband can't or to do something like that. I am happy to help her out and I don't mind it. I also am happy to know that everything's ok with the pregnancy and her child, it's ok if she wants to talk every once in a while about that or about something they brought for the baby, etc. I can tolerate that. However she wants to talk about her pregnancy/ baby all the time we're together. \n\nI think she's testing my patience or something. Everytime I try to talk about something else she somehow turns the conversation to her pregnancy, its irritating. Like we could be talking about work and she turns the conversation about her maternity leave or something. Or we could be talking about something personal to me and she would tell me something regarding marriage and \"when you're a mom\" or stuff like that, it's annoying. \n\nYesterday I was having a bad day, honestly I had a bad week because I broke with my boyfriend and I had to work on Saturday, I was tired and just wasn't in a good mood. We already had plans to have dinner together so as did not felt like going out I invited her to my house and we ordered take away. \n\nWe ate and were talking afterwards. I was just ranting about life to her and such. And then she somehow turns the conversation again to her pregnancy. She started telling me about her back hurting and how she felt the baby kicking and such. She went on like that for like 10 minutes until I got tired of it and I told her so. I said \"I don't care much about pregnancies, can we take about something else?\" She was very angry and she told me she was telling me about something important to her, I told her that it's only important to her, I don't care to know every single detail of her pregnancy, and we can find something else to talk just for once. She got more upset and called me an asshole and a bad friend. We argued and then she left. Now she's angry and doesn't answer my texts. AITA? I feel like I acted wrong but she also is tiring with just talking about the pregnancy all the time and I snapped.\n\n\nEdit: I broke off with my boyfriend because we had been talking about marriage and kids, he wants them and I don't so it was a deal breaker for him. My friend knows this, she knows this was a big issue for us and she tells me all the time that I'll change my mind about kids sooner or later. Maybe that's part of the reason why I snapped too", "created_utc": 1682258503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w9p48/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like your friend doesn't realize how much space they're letting their pregnancy take up space in your conversations and she's being a bad friend to you. Truly not everything is about her pregnancy. While this is her whole life right now, it shouldn't completely define your friendship, and she should be able to have the self awareness to understand that when you need support for the big things in your life she give you ample time. It sounds like you were dealing with this frustration for a while, and didn't mention it earlier, and it came out in a moment of anger. It happens. I would try to reach out and explain you obviously care about her pregnancy and understand it's a huge thing going on in her life, but also express your feelings about still needing support and attention and acknowledgement about the big things going on your life. If she doesn't get it after that, maybe not immediately but with some time, then just give her space. Unforchunately some people when they have kids become very self centered, talk only of their children, and forget how to be good friends to the people in their lives. She might be one of them. If she can't figure out that her pregnancy should not be the center of every conversation, then she's definitely going to be talking non stop about her kids and being a mom and it will just be exhausting and create a wedge. Good luck, and also you sound like a good friend. Hang in there.", "NTA This is the exact reason why many new moms lose their adult friends. Because they refuse to understand that people don't want to talk about their fucking kid 24 hours a day.", "NTA, it\u2019s normal to witness people talk about their achievements, but not make it their whole personality. She surely knows you don\u2019t like children and she could have been more considerate when choosing which topic to bring up. It\u2019s good that you let her know.", "NTA but I would\u2019ve said it differently. Like hey we talk about your pregnancy a lot and I\u2019m at capacity right now to hear about it. I\u2019m having a hard week, can I share my problems. If you can\u2019t handle my issues that\u2019s fine, but then I need some space. Or something like that", "NTA, you really need to edit your post though so everyone knows you stance on pregnancy. shes been dragging you abou tin hopes that it changes your mind so you will have a kid and be in the same boat as her", "NTA\n\nYou've been there for months when she needed you, and the one day you were the one who needed her she just kept making it about her baby.\n\nSome expectant moms make their entire life about being a mom and become a much different person than they were for the purposes of being their friend. There's nothing objectively wrong with that, but you and your friend may not have the connection anymore that made for your friendship to be as strong as it was.", "NAH, It\u2019s obviously a huge milestone for her so good for your friend, however you got to remember she\u2019s quite literally going through a huge change with new hormones being produced in preparation to carry this baby along with the eventual delivery so it\u2019s not entirely her fault", "INFO: Was this the first time she felt the baby kicking? \n\nBecause I can understand her wish to share if it was the first time she experienced the feeling, but under the circumstances... She clearly thought you intended to have kids, given her 'when you are a mom' comments, but if that were the case her pregnancy talk could have been even more insensitive given your break-up.", "NTA for feeling like that, maybe soft TA for how you phrased it. It sounded like you hate talking about it and were just taked allong. Which can be horrifying when she braught you to her appointments. She gave you a full insight few about what happens to her - trusted you and the way you phrased it, sounds like you never liked anything of that, never found it important and so on.\n\nBut I very much get your point. Of corse you have other important topics to talk about. You have your life and as you said, you had a bad day. You wanted to tal about things that are important to you! And a friendship should have the possible to talk about both.\n\nINFO: was she always like that, just wanting to tal about her stuff and ignoring yours? If not, it could be pregnancy brain. Her situation can be difficulty and so she migth only be thining about bringing new live into the world. Appologice in this case for your phrasing. You didn't ment that you are absolutly not interested in her pregnancy, but that you still see her not only as a mother to be but also as your friend, as a person by herself. And at that night (or at some nights) you just want to talk about other things, you things and also her things (work, hobbies, movies) but not only about her pregnancy.", "Nta. Ppl tend to get super consumed with their lives and forget about the lives of others.", "NTA", "NAH this was clearly not the day for the two of you to meet up. She's emotional due to her pregnancy and you due to your break up.\nI think maybe your delivery was a bit too much, but I don't think either of you were ready to listen. \nTake some time apart, then try talking it out. I'm sure it will work itself out. But be firm, tell her that you might not be the person to \"pregnancy rant\" at.", "NTA", "NTA since she\u2019s doing this is to get you to change your mind abt kids for yourself", "NTA. Your friend lacks basic empathy and sounds self-centered.", "NAH.  All pregnant women can think about is their pregnancy.  It permeates every aspect of their lives.  Especially their first pregnancy.  Give her some grace for that.  It's just how it is.  You could have handled your message better for sure.  Maybe, when the dust settles she will dial it back a bit knowing how your feel about the subject...  You are on two different paths and it seems like there may not be enough in common to maintain a close friendship.", "NAH. Like you said, you\u2019re at different milestones in your life. Pregnancy is literally the only major thing happening to her right now and it\u2019s a pretty significant thing. It impacts literally everything in your life. \n\nI think you could\u2019ve been softer in your delivery but maybe she doesn\u2019t realise how much she\u2019s talking about it. Maybe you just need to communicate with each other better.", "YTA\n\n  I couldn't move past the part where you keep expecting applause for celebrating her wedding and being happy for her pregnancy. \n\n>that was about supporting a friend and not about me\n\n And yet you made it about you by congratulating yourself. \n\n>however I can be happy for the people around me who want them, I'm not one of those bitter childfree people who hate kids/ parents. \n\n I can't even on this....", "YTA\n\nYou know you didn't need to be that callous. It's fine to say nicely that you'd like to change the subject, but you were rude.", "ESH I think your friendship has likely run its course. After the baby is born, your friend will be able to talk only about it and seeing as you don't want children, that's going to be unbearable. You were rude in your delivery and your friend was overbearing in discussing an issue you obviously had no interest in.", "I got to admit I rolled my eyes at your \"I'm not like those bitter cf people\" like the childfree version of I'm not like the other girls.\n\nOverall.... not wrong for the sentiment but your delivery SUCKED.", "YTA, but only because you let this go on for so long without speaking up and then just exploded at her. For her this must have seemed out of nowhere, and because of the size of your explosion she\u2019s going to feel like she can\u2019t come to you for any of this at all. That\u2019s going to leave her feeling lost and abandoned, and like she has to walk on eggshells.\n\nYou need to sit down with her ASAP and have an adult conversation about how you love being there for her, you\u2019re happy about the baby, and that you understand how important this whole thing is, but that you worry she\u2019s not leaving room for the other things that make her such an awesome person. Tell her you\u2019re worried about her losing herself, and remind her that your life hasn\u2019t been put on pause while she\u2019s dealing with this and you could also use some support.", "YTA. This is your friend, and it's a massively life-changing event for her. \n\nIf you had a major life change, and wanted to talk about it with your friend, how would you feel if they blatantly told you \"I don't really care about this?\"", "YTA. You were rude and straight up mean to a friend who is going through an ongoing process of bodily and emotional change. That is all she's probably thinking about right now, because it can be all-consuming. Her life will change constantly from this point forward, and if you can't be there for her now, or communicate with maturity, the friendship is probably done.", "NTA, however, there are some introspective steps you could take, to look more from the outside perspective.There is nothing wrong with communicating that your main topics are too focused on the friend's pregnancy, you could do it more delicately, but considering your current situation the friend should understand and give you more time to vent, and not go into: who has it worse match.However, there can be confirmation bias from your side, and you are too overfocused every time the topic comes out. I am not saying that is the case, but  I would play a little bit of a devil's advocate, and try to defend your friend in your head. Look if really all your conversations were mainly focused on that with more good-willed eyes. Maybe talk to someone and speak out loud both sides and if the verdict will be still that your friend is just selfish right now, well. You have every right to feel neglected and sad. You can also give more examples here to clear your mind.Some people got a baby fever too much, and it is really irritating. I hope you will be able to communicate your needs with the friend in a calmer manner, and she will be able to look at you and your perspective.But you are not an asshole for sure, it is just an argument, where both sides were hurt. I think your friend overreacted, but still, gotta talk it out. But do not worry, I think almost everyone can relate when someone is pregnant, and they have like: I am the center of the world, and my baby also, time. It is not always the case, but well... I feel ya, to have to endure it.", "YTA. TBH you sound a bit envious.", "YTA. Her pregnancy is probably a big deal to her and something she talks about because it's something she constantly thinks about. It's a huge life change, and you're not being a supportive friend by blowing up on her out of the blue for it. It sounds like you were butter over your break up and took it out on her.", "Yta \n\nGo apologize. And talk to her like an adult.", "YTA being pregnant is kinda a really big deal. You could have handled this so much better. Maybe learn to have more respectful and open communication instead of waiting until the situation blows up.", "NTA for feeling this way but you were kind of rude soooo soft YTA for your choice of words.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP needs to be able to communicate these feelings with her friend while being conscious that it\u2019s a big milestone as you said. And the friend should attempt to be more considerate to others and realize that while people are most likely excited for her, they still have lives that do not revolve around her baby", "Yeah it was the first time she noticed it. \n\nShe knows I don't want kids, she knows that's in fact the reason why my ex and I broke off, she just thinks I'll change my mind", "I mean, thats not how it is for all pregnant people. My best friend rarely talked about her pregnancy.", "Agree 100%, it\u2019s only gonna get worse and you guys grow further apart when she has another little human running around. Her life will be fully consumed by the baby trust me, I\u2019m a dad of an 8 week old.", "Yeah I get the comparison, I just wanted to say that I don't hate pregnant people/ parents just because they choose to have kids like some other people (specially online) do. Some people can be really bitter about other's choices, I wanted to point out that I don't feel I am like that.", "Agree 100%. Could have just said \u201ccan we please change the subject\u201d nicely.", "Why would I be envious about the pregnancy that I do not want?", "Yeah, I could see either judgment working here. They could both be doing a better job in the relationship so could be E S H or N A H.", "Wait.... you and your bf broke it off because you don't want kids and she's going on and on about her pregnancy while you're dealing with the break up?", "This is information that should be in the OP.

She knows this was an issue for us and knows we broke off because of that.", "Yeah, I didn't think about that while writing it, I'll add it", "How so?", "She doesn\u2019t sound envious at all. It is clear she is just being a good friend and the pregnant woman is hyper focused on herself and her baby. It seems to me you are projecting because there is nothing here that indicates she wants any of those things from that path in life. And good for her for knowing that. I know plenty of people who steer clear of that path and are happier for it.", "Well, I am not", "Your friend is an asshole. Good lord.", "[deleted]", "Fine, but why not be more understanding? You may not want that \u201cpath\u201d but it\u2019s more than a path for most who do it.", "Well whatever the case you should be more understanding. Pregnancy is a lot and a lot can go wrong at any time. Having kids may not be something you want but for a lot of people it\u2019s their meaning in life.

Her pregnancy and family sounds like her life and what she wants to talk about. You\u2019re allowed to chose your friends.", "I am married, 2 adult daughters, one grandkid. I try not to monopolize every conversation I have about these things. And I don\u2019t think I did when I was at the beginning of this journey either. It is easy to get sucked into the excitement and enormity of birthing and raising a child. It does change your whole life. But, it does not affect others as much as it does to one\u2019s self. And it\u2019s only so interesting. I guess like an old person talking about their ailments all the time. Boring. It is relationship logic that you don\u2019t only talk about yourself with friends. You may want to let this friend go."]}
