We are good friends, we just have been drafting away recently because our lives are too different. She got married and I am happy for her because that's something she wanted, her husband also is a good man and that's nice, I was her bridesmaid and celebrated her even though I'm not a big wedding person because obviously that was about supporting a friend and not about me.\n\nNow she's pregnant (around five months) and I'm also happy for her, she's very excited to be a mom. I'm not a person who likes kids or wants them to myself, however I can be happy for the people around me who want them, I'm not one of those bitter childfree people who hate kids/ parents. \n\nHer family lives a few hours away so she often asks me to go with her to appointments if her husband can't or to do something like that. I am happy to help her out and I don't mind it. I also am happy to know that everything's ok with the pregnancy and her child, it's ok if she wants to talk every once in a while about that or about something they brought for the baby, etc. I can tolerate that. However she wants to talk about her pregnancy/ baby all the time we're together. \n\nI think she's testing my patience or something. Everytime I try to talk about something else she somehow turns the conversation to her pregnancy, its irritating. Like we could be talking about work and she turns the conversation about her maternity leave or something. Or we could be talking about something personal to me and she would tell me something regarding marriage and \"when you're a mom\" or stuff like that, it's annoying. \n\nYesterday I was having a bad day, honestly I had a bad week because I broke with my boyfriend and I had to work on Saturday, I was tired and just wasn't in a good mood. We already had plans to have dinner together so as did not felt like going out I invited her to my house and we ordered take away. \n\nWe ate and were talking afterwards. I was just ranting about life to her and such. And then she somehow turns the conversation again to her pregnancy. She started telling me about her back hurting and how she felt the baby kicking and such. She went on like that for like 10 minutes until I got tired of it and I told her so. I said \"I don't care much about pregnancies, can we take about something else?\" She was very angry and she told me she was telling me about something important to her, I told her that it's only important to her, I don't care to know every single detail of her pregnancy, and we can find something else to talk just for once. She got more upset and called me an asshole and a bad friend. We argued and then she left. Now she's angry and doesn't answer my texts. AITA? I feel like I acted wrong but she also is tiring with just talking about the pregnancy all the time and I snapped.\n\n\nEdit: I broke off with my boyfriend because we had been talking about marriage and kids, he wants them and I don't so it was a deal breaker for him. My friend knows this, she knows this was a big issue for us and she tells me all the time that I'll change my mind about kids sooner or later. Maybe that's part of the reason why I snapped too", "created_utc": 1682258503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w9p48/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like your friend doesn't realize how much space they're letting their pregnancy take up space in your conversations and she's being a bad friend to you. Truly not everything is about her pregnancy. While this is her whole life right now, it shouldn't completely define your friendship, and she should be able to have the self awareness to understand that when you need support for the big things in your life she give you ample time. It sounds like you were dealing with this frustration for a while, and didn't mention it earlier, and it came out in a moment of anger. It happens. I would try to reach out and explain you obviously care about her pregnancy and understand it's a huge thing going on in her life, but also express your feelings about still needing support and attention and acknowledgement about the big things going on your life. If she doesn't get it after that, maybe not immediately but with some time, then just give her space. Unforchunately some people when they have kids become very self centered, talk only of their children, and forget how to be good friends to the people in their lives. She might be one of them. If she can't figure out that her pregnancy should not be the center of every conversation, then she's definitely going to be talking non stop about her kids and being a mom and it will just be exhausting and create a wedge. Good luck, and also you sound like a good friend. Hang in there.", "NTA This is the exact reason why many new moms lose their adult friends. Because they refuse to understand that people don't want to talk about their fucking kid 24 hours a day.", "NTA, it\u2019s normal to witness people talk about their achievements, but not make it their whole personality. She surely knows you don\u2019t like children and she could have been more considerate when choosing which topic to bring up. It\u2019s good that you let her know.", "NTA but I would\u2019ve said it differently. Like hey we talk about your pregnancy a lot and I\u2019m at capacity right now to hear about it. I\u2019m having a hard week, can I share my problems. If you can\u2019t handle my issues that\u2019s fine, but then I need some space. Or something like that", "NTA, you really need to edit your post though so everyone knows you stance on pregnancy. shes been dragging you abou tin hopes that it changes your mind so you will have a kid and be in the same boat as her", "NTA\n\nYou've been there for months when she needed you, and the one day you were the one who needed her she just kept making it about her baby.\n\nSome expectant moms make their entire life about being a mom and become a much different person than they were for the purposes of being their friend. There's nothing objectively wrong with that, but you and your friend may not have the connection anymore that made for your friendship to be as strong as it was.", "NAH, It\u2019s obviously a huge milestone for her so good for your friend, however you got to remember she\u2019s quite literally going through a huge change with new hormones being produced in preparation to carry this baby along with the eventual delivery so it\u2019s not entirely her fault", "INFO: Was this the first time she felt the baby kicking? \n\nBecause I can understand her wish to share if it was the first time she experienced the feeling, but under the circumstances... She clearly thought you intended to have kids, given her 'when you are a mom' comments, but if that were the case her pregnancy talk could have been even more insensitive given your break-up.", "NTA for feeling like that, maybe soft TA for how you phrased it. It sounded like you hate talking about it and were just taked allong. Which can be horrifying when she braught you to her appointments. She gave you a full insight few about what happens to her - trusted you and the way you phrased it, sounds like you never liked anything of that, never found it important and so on.\n\nBut I very much get your point. Of corse you have other important topics to talk about. You have your life and as you said, you had a bad day. You wanted to tal about things that are important to you! And a friendship should have the possible to talk about both.\n\nINFO: was she always like that, just wanting to tal about her stuff and ignoring yours? If not, it could be pregnancy brain. Her situation can be difficulty and so she migth only be thining about bringing new live into the world. Appologice in this case for your phrasing. You didn't ment that you are absolutly not interested in her pregnancy, but that you still see her not only as a mother to be but also as your friend, as a person by herself. And at that night (or at some nights) you just want to talk about other things, you things and also her things (work, hobbies, movies) but not only about her pregnancy.", "Nta. Ppl tend to get super consumed with their lives and forget about the lives of others.", "NTA", "NAH this was clearly not the day for the two of you to meet up. She's emotional due to her pregnancy and you due to your break up.\nI think maybe your delivery was a bit too much, but I don't think either of you were ready to listen. \nTake some time apart, then try talking it out. I'm sure it will work itself out. But be firm, tell her that you might not be the person to \"pregnancy rant\" at.", "NTA", "NTA since she\u2019s doing this is to get you to change your mind abt kids for yourself", "NTA. Your friend lacks basic empathy and sounds self-centered.", "NAH.  All pregnant women can think about is their pregnancy.  It permeates every aspect of their lives.  Especially their first pregnancy.  Give her some grace for that.  It's just how it is.  You could have handled your message better for sure.  Maybe, when the dust settles she will dial it back a bit knowing how your feel about the subject...  You are on two different paths and it seems like there may not be enough in common to maintain a close friendship.", "NAH. Like you said, you\u2019re at different milestones in your life. Pregnancy is literally the only major thing happening to her right now and it\u2019s a pretty significant thing. It impacts literally everything in your life. \n\nI think you could\u2019ve been softer in your delivery but maybe she doesn\u2019t realise how much she\u2019s talking about it. Maybe you just need to communicate with each other better.", "YTA\n\n  I couldn't move past the part where you keep expecting applause for celebrating her wedding and being happy for her pregnancy. \n\n>that was about supporting a friend and not about me\n\n And yet you made it about you by congratulating yourself. \n\n>however I can be happy for the people around me who want them, I'm not one of those bitter childfree people who hate kids/ parents. \n\n I can't even on this....", "YTA\n\nYou know you didn't need to be that callous. It's fine to say nicely that you'd like to change the subject, but you were rude.", "ESH I think your friendship has likely run its course. After the baby is born, your friend will be able to talk only about it and seeing as you don't want children, that's going to be unbearable. You were rude in your delivery and your friend was overbearing in discussing an issue you obviously had no interest in.", "I got to admit I rolled my eyes at your \"I'm not like those bitter cf people\" like the childfree version of I'm not like the other girls.\n\nOverall.... not wrong for the sentiment but your delivery SUCKED.", "YTA, but only because you let this go on for so long without speaking up and then just exploded at her. For her this must have seemed out of nowhere, and because of the size of your explosion she\u2019s going to feel like she can\u2019t come to you for any of this at all. That\u2019s going to leave her feeling lost and abandoned, and like she has to walk on eggshells.\n\nYou need to sit down with her ASAP and have an adult conversation about how you love being there for her, you\u2019re happy about the baby, and that you understand how important this whole thing is, but that you worry she\u2019s not leaving room for the other things that make her such an awesome person. Tell her you\u2019re worried about her losing herself, and remind her that your life hasn\u2019t been put on pause while she\u2019s dealing with this and you could also use some support.", "YTA. This is your friend, and it's a massively life-changing event for her. \n\nIf you had a major life change, and wanted to talk about it with your friend, how would you feel if they blatantly told you \"I don't really care about this?\"", "YTA. You were rude and straight up mean to a friend who is going through an ongoing process of bodily and emotional change. That is all she's probably thinking about right now, because it can be all-consuming. Her life will change constantly from this point forward, and if you can't be there for her now, or communicate with maturity, the friendship is probably done.", "NTA, however, there are some introspective steps you could take, to look more from the outside perspective.There is nothing wrong with communicating that your main topics are too focused on the friend's pregnancy, you could do it more delicately, but considering your current situation the friend should understand and give you more time to vent, and not go into: who has it worse match.However, there can be confirmation bias from your side, and you are too overfocused every time the topic comes out. I am not saying that is the case, but  I would play a little bit of a devil's advocate, and try to defend your friend in your head. Look if really all your conversations were mainly focused on that with more good-willed eyes. Maybe talk to someone and speak out loud both sides and if the verdict will be still that your friend is just selfish right now, well. You have every right to feel neglected and sad. You can also give more examples here to clear your mind.Some people got a baby fever too much, and it is really irritating. I hope you will be able to communicate your needs with the friend in a calmer manner, and she will be able to look at you and your perspective.But you are not an asshole for sure, it is just an argument, where both sides were hurt. I think your friend overreacted, but still, gotta talk it out. But do not worry, I think almost everyone can relate when someone is pregnant, and they have like: I am the center of the world, and my baby also, time. It is not always the case, but well... I feel ya, to have to endure it.", "YTA. TBH you sound a bit envious.", "YTA. Her pregnancy is probably a big deal to her and something she talks about because it's something she constantly thinks about. It's a huge life change, and you're not being a supportive friend by blowing up on her out of the blue for it. \n\nEDIT: For those downvoting, make sure you read the post. OP literally told her friend \"I don't care about pregnancies.\" Why do you guys think it's okay to say that to your pregnant friend? That's definitely an AH move. OP has a right to be annoyed all their conversations go back to her friend's pregnancy, but there's a right and a wrong way to address this. OP is an asshole for saying this to her friend, because she's basically telling her friend she doesn't care about her pregnancy. She also said that the pregnancy was something that was only important to her friend, not to OP.", "Yta \n\nGo apologize. And talk to her like an adult.", "YTA being pregnant is kinda a really big deal. You could have handled this so much better. Maybe learn to have more respectful and open communication instead of waiting until the situation blows up.", "NTA for feeling this way but you were kind of rude soooo soft YTA for your choice of words.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that she doesn't accept that you don't want kids and insists you'll be a mom someday makes her the AH big time.

Also yes, talking about nothing but pregnancy gets annoying after awhile", "NTA.\nI would also want to know is this just pregnancy or is it something she has always done and it wasn't as noticeable because it was topics that you didn't have that strong of feelings about. \nI had a friend like this that all conversations lead back to her. \nIt's always about her, it clicked when it was noticeable to a third party that pointed out my friend always brought it back to her no matter the conversation.

Sorry", "NTA\n\nPregnant people are incapable of talking about anything that isn\u2019t their pregnancy, not seeming to understand that the only people that care as much as them are their partner and maybe their parents.

Sure, it's annoying, but it's her first pregnancy, it's scary AF, and she has an alien growing in her body that's changing her life forever in just a matter of months. Of course it's on her mind 24/7. It happens to all new mothers. Could she have shut up about it and listened to your problems for one day? Sure. But instead you told her you didn't want to talk about something that was important to her. If you already saw your lives drifting apart, let it. It's obvious your lives don't align and they won't ever again, so just let it fizzle out and find new friends who might talk about things you want to talk about. Does it matter who the asshole is if the friendship won't continue anyways?", "Kinda surprised by the NTAs.\n\nSolid ESH. In my opinion.\n\nYour friend is pregnant and is oversharing/clouded by her pregnancy. That\u2019s pretty normal, but it can be annoying. I had to do a LOT of mental checks when I\u2019m as pregnant to make sure i wasn\u2019t overloading people with it. It\u2019s kinda hard because because it wasn\u2019t my whole identity, but it\u2019s was new, exciting, and very very in MY face. My whole life intentionally and unintentionally was now centered around it, so all my stories kind of became about it. It limited a lot of the more interesting hobbies I did too, and just getting out in general so I lost a lot of the extra things I usually had to talk about.\n\nSometimes all pregnant friends need is a simple \u201chey this whole conversation has kind of been about pregnancy, can we shift gears a bit?\u201d\n\nInstead you let this stew in the background, until it caught up to you on a bad, during a bad week where you and your boyfriend broke over, among other things babies, and then you still let up with your friend whose pregnant and talks a lot about pregnancy, and you finally snapped.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, you didn\u2019t blow up at her. And she\u2019s an AH too for not reading the room and having the common sense to know your issues with your bf and still rant about pregnancy \u2014but honestly. This fight didn\u2019t need to happen this way. This could be addressed earlier and more often, this could\u2019ve even been \u201cfriend I just broke up with my bf over having children, I\u2019d really just like it if we didn\u2019t talk about pregnancy and babies today.\u201d And then if she doesn\u2019t stop, that\u2019s when you get mad.", "Why couldn\u2019t you say something like \u201cI really need to vent, do you mind if we focus on me for a few minutes and then we can focus on you?\u201d. YTA for saying you don\u2019t care about something important to your friend. NTA for not wanting kids or wanting to hear about it, but YTA for not setting conversational boundaries and for staying friends with someone you obviously no longer care about.", "Not the Ahole. The world don\u2019t revolve around pregnant women and your so called friend shouldn\u2019t always push her pregnancy stuff on you. Especially if she knows your not interested. She\u2019s over emotional and wasn\u2019t thinking about you and what you\u2019re going through. On the other hand, you shouldn\u2019t have blown up at her, you could have calmly told her to stop or go home.", "ESH. Your friend should realize that not everything is about her pregnancy. But you also need to learn to communicate like an adult and realize that this is a life changing event for her so yes she will talk about her pregnancy more than you may want", "ESH. She's excited, so she wants to share that excitement. She does need to learn not to talk about herself so much when someone is venting, though. You could have phrased this better. Saying you don't care about her pregnancy is pretty brutal. Next time, stop and think before blurting things like that out.", "Going against the grain here and say YTA\n\nI totally get your point, 100%, but you could have expressed yourself a lot better.", "Your friend is an insufferable pregnant woman. I had two pregnant friends last year, and we were still able to maintain our friendship. Like you, I\u2019m not really interested in any of that. But it was important to me to maintain the friendship, so I would listen and offer support, but that wasn\u2019t the only thing we would ever talk about.", "YTA. You had dinner and were talking afterward. That implies that you had already been hanging out for a substantial amount of time before she brought up that her back was hurting and she was in physical discomfort. It was insensitive to decide that she\u2019s not allowed to talk about what she\u2019s experiencing in that moment because you\u2019re just sick of all pregnancy talk. Based on this story, it sounds like you\u2019re probably overestimating how much she talks about the pregnancy, since she didn\u2019t say anything about it until after you were done with dinner", "So, it's okay when you want to discuss matters that are important to you and she should tread lightly when talking about her pregnancy. Perhaps it's time for you to distance yourself from this mother-to-be since being around her is such an ordeal for you. YTA.", "NTA maybe your tone was bad but your friend should also have gotten the hint and she emotionally dismissed you with the whole \u201cone day you\u2019ll change your mind\u201d statement that\u2019s offensive", "You know what? I\u2019m about to say it. I don\u2019t care that you got knocked up. \n\nLol, NTA", "NTA. \n\nNobody wants to spend time with someone who talks nonstop about something they aren't interested in every time you see them. It's true whether it's someone's RPG campaign, fantasy sports league, their job, their kids, their relationship drama, etc.\n\nIt's totally understandable that your friend's pregnancy is like The Thing she wants to talk about because it's the most important thing to her. But she needs to recognize that what's important to her isn't important to everyone else and talk about it in moderation and in appropriate times and recognize the social cues for \"this person isn't interested anymore, time to switch topics.\"\n\nEveryone I have ever known who's gotten pregnant or has kids spends like 99% of their time talking about it. It's why I don't spend much time with those people anymore. I can only feign polite interest for so long, since I don't care about little Timmy's school experience, sports, and the excruciatingly detailed play by play of everything he's done in the last week.", "NTA, no one liks it when someone is self absorbed and can only make one topic their personality, and  ring pregnant isn't an excuse to do that", "Nta, my friend finally realized she was doing this too (after multiple people say her down and said it has to stop we can't hear about your pregnancy 24/7).  She says she's getting therapy, I'd say your friend should do the same", "NTA. I feel the exact same way regarding children and marriage. My friend of 7 years just told me last week that she is pregnant after trying for a long time. I was happy for her because she has been trying for a year and that is what she really wants, however I felt fake when congratulating her. I completely understand and it is draining when that is all the person can talk about.", "NTA\n\nyou don't want kids. But even if you do, if that's all someone talks it's a bit boring. \n\nYou say you have been drifting apart and that happens. Time to widen your circle to include people whose interests are more aligned with yours.", "NAH\n\nIt's a hard adjustment to make on both sides. Have you heard the song \"Pregnant women are smug\" by Garfunkle and Oates? I think you might get a kick out of it.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LbTB3ASkdOo", "NTA but considering the reason of your breakup maybe inviting your pregnant friend wasn't the brightest idea.", "NTA. Your friend is TA for trying to convince you to change your mind on children and for how she just forces it in to all your conversation", "Especially when the person they\u2019re talking to is ranting about a break up that is partially the result of that individual *not wanting kids*. Like, damn, how hard is it to read the room and not bring up the pregnancy during THAT conversation?", "This is the unfortunate truth. You always see parents talking about how hard it is to make new friends when you have a kid, but I swear in reality it's just because they make their children 100% of their personality.\n\nAt the end of the day maybe it's just very difficult for childree people to maintain a close friendship with people who have had kids.", "amen!  its like they lost their identity when they get pregnant", "I\u2019m having a hard week, can I share my problems.", "I almost want to say ESH. OP needs to be able to communicate these feelings with her friend while being conscious", "Been there done that. Lost so many friends because their life mission is suddenly parenting. Totally natural that people who get married or have kids lose their friendships as they acquire a completely opposite perspective, and feel \u2018settled down\u2019  while their single friends are still ranting about \u201cirrelevant\u201d things such as dating and careers. That friend should probably join some local moms' group and discuss such things with them. Then again, these moms might have more outstanding stories/sufferings which may overshadow her  \u201dunique experience\u201d. \n\nNTA.", "Getting knocked up isn\u2019t an achievement per se.", "[removed]", "Good response! But understandably OP snapped in the heat of the moment, going through a tough time herself", "I don't feel childfree people are always bitter, but there are some childfree people who trends to hate on parents/ kids just because they don't agree with their life choices. I'm not saying everyone is like that, quite the opposite, they're a small part of the childfree community but sometimes they're the loudest and I wanted to make sure people would understand that I'm not one of those few bitter people", "Since all pregnant people do this, have you perhaps given it any thought on why??", "I don't understand why people are downvoting this", "I avoided talking about my pregnancy as much as possible. Not to spare my friends, but because I couldn't think of a more boring topic. Very little happens from day to day, and it's literally nine months of people going: \"How exciting! Aren't you SO EXCITED?\" I was happy to be pregnant, but a pregnancy is long and - in the best case scenario - fairly uneventful. I would have struggled to spend more than ten minutes on the topic on any given day.", "OP did have a life changing event tho. She broke up with her bf bc he wants marriage and children and she doesn\u2019t. This will have an effect on all her future relationships as she tries to suss out if her partner has the same values as her and whether his shared values will change in the future and she\u2019ll face pressure to change hers.", "Perhaps it's time for the pregnant woman to realise that her friend has been supportive of her pregnancy for months, despite having issues with her boyfriend about having kids. And on this one day where OP needed her friend to rant about HER problems for once, her friend just had to make it about the damn baby again. You see, this is why young mothers lose all of their friends once they have their kid. Because they don't seem to realise that people have different problems in life besides having kids.", "OP takes her friend to medical appointments. Seems to me she\u2019s been very supportive.", "I had to go back and find it because I just skimmed right over it. That's gold.", "I just lost it at this comment hahaha.", "When I saw that word, I stopped reading to go check the responses below because I knew it wasn't just me that saw that! Great response BTW. And NTA.", "\u2620\ufe0f", "I actually didn't read the rest of the comment because of that. Dead stop right there lol. I have to go back to it automatically and I can't focus on anything else. I'm not definitely not trying to be the spelling police, but I've NEVER seen \"unfortunately\" spelled like this, so I'm just like...why?", "It's the ancient chupacabric spelling.", "Gonna be in my nightmares oh heck", "\ud83d\ude02 I was thinking the same thing! I had to read over that word a few times! \ud83e\udd23", "I read your comment first ( parent comment was too long so I kinda skimmed ) went back , saw it and scream NO", "Shoot", "Do you mean courteous?", "Bad bot", "Yeah it\u2019s a life event, not an achievement. Her bringing it up during a conversation about a break up that happened due to the fact that OP doesn\u2019t want kids is inappropriate. The friend needs to learn to read the room", "Getting through a pregnancy is though", "Bad bot! Partial comment stolen from wonderful horror further down.  Reported.", "Bad bot", "WTF? She had never felt the baby kick before and your response to that is to think she\u2019s dominating the conversation by mentioning it?", "OP said in another comment the friend knew OP and ex broke up because OP doesnt want kids, and friend continued to talk about her pregnancy anyway. Op also states said friend insists that OP would change their mind. So  e s h wouldn't really work here lol\n\nNot to mention i dont think OP's response was really all that mean anyway? I guess I'm missing tone and OP could be lying in how they phrased it. But saying \"I'm not super interested in hearing about this let's talk about something else\" when your friend of 10 years knows you're going through it, and should be there for you isn't rude. OP should've brought it up earlier, yeah, but idk that OP is really in the wrong for that lol", "You'll get just as much flack either way tbh. I don't like kids. I also don't like some of the misogyny, classism and eugenics in cf spaces", "OP told her \"I don't care about pregnancies\" and that her friend's pregnancy was only important to her friend. Who says that to their pregnant friend? It's an AH move.", "She has been supportive, but grudgingly so. I've seen people more enthusiastic about getting root canals.", "You don't sound envious at all.", "That doesn't mean it's okay to tell your pregnant friend not to talk about their pregnancy. OP isn't an AH for being annoyed, OP is an AH for shutting down her friend out of the blue. There are a lot of better ways she could have approached this.\n\nShe literally said she didn't care about pregnancies, and that her friend's pregnancy was only important to her friend. How do you think that made her friend feel? She could have politely asked to shift the subject to something else.\n\nAlso, if my friend went to my appointments but later told me, \"I don't care about pregnancies\" and that my pregnancy didn't matter to them, I probably wouldn't WANT that person at any of my appointments.", "Perhaps OP was sleepwalking lol", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w9p48/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_i_dont_care_about/jhem6ud?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "When the current conversation is a breakup caused by not wanting kids, and the pregnant woman has repeatedly said that OP would curate her mind about kids, yes, she is dominating the conversation. Especially as she brings the pregnancy into EVERY conversation. Like the one where OP talked about her breakup due to OP not wanting kids.", "Yeah she is. The news that her baby kicked her could wait for a few hours, especially when your dear friend who has been there for you your whole pregnancy needs your support about her problems for ONE DAY.", "Agreed. Friend here was in the clouds about her pregnancy. Fair and valid, but OP hasn't been in a friendship for this whole time. She's just been Baby Waiter. Appointments, shopping, even meals out is about Baby or Friend having problems from being pregnant. OP is turning into a cardboard friend, expected to just nod and be a prop for Friend to talk at. \n\nNTA. OP was trying to talk about herself for five seconds and Friend wouldn't even let her have that.", "You can't expect people to always feel a certain way about things. OP has been a great and supportive friend for a long time, but friendships should go both ways. OP needed her friend after her break up and instead of supporting her, she makes it all about her baby again.", "How self obsessed and callous of her.", "Do you think she keeps bringing this up because she's turning self centered or because she's trying to subtly harass you into also getting pregnant? Because she's still doing it when you just broke up with your boyfriend over this very issue so it's not surprising you got upset and snapped at her. \n\nI'm also baffled by adults wanting to take non-spouses/long term partners/other parent/close family members to doctor appointments of this nature. \n\nThat is a very uncomfortable favor and borderline enmeshment. It would be different if she had something like cancer, I would understand. You aren't even life long best friends. If she needs this much support/hand holding/attention, she's going to have some problems real fast. \n\nI think you two are going to drift apart and that might be best for you. You know she's going to want babysitting.", "You should add this info to your post as it changes the entire tone of your friendship as well as your friend\u2019s character. She\u2019s not just self-absorbed but also condescending and patronizing, and she\u2019s trying to manipulate you into something you\u2019re not interested in. Don\u2019t accompany her in these visits anymore imo, what you\u2019re doing out of friendship she\u2019s reading as a sign that she needs to convert you to motherhood. Btw as a childless woman myself - when you know, you know. I\u2019m very happy where I am in life, your friend is wrong in her assumptions.", "You know your friend isn't a friend, right?  And you're going to be dumped the hot second you refuse to make everything in your life also about her kids?\n\nMight as well get it over and done with now and spare yourself the headache before you get fed up and end up in the inevitable place.", "I don't want the \"joy\" of children either, op. Everybody tells me that I will \"some day\" or when I \"meet the right person.\" There has never been anything joyful about children to me. \n\nEverybody doesn't want kids. Good for you for recognizing that in yourself and refusing to let anyone pressure you into it. Because only the people that want them should have them, not just for their sakes but for the kids as well.", "I didn\u2019t realize that the friend actually told OP that she would change her mind about wanting kids. That changes things. From the comment alone, I thought this was something OP had inferred. If the friend really said this in regard to the breakup, then that\u2019s the real issue. It\u2019s still not the friend\u2019s shortcoming that she mentioned back pain and the baby kicking for the first time while they were hanging out though. When I have dinner with a friend and we\u2019re talking afterward, I don\u2019t think they are being an asshole for talking about something other than me for a second, no matter how bad my situation is. It sounds like they were talking for a long time before the friend brought it up", "Yeah wait til baby is a couple of months old and friend hasn't had a night's sleep and baby has colic or whatever...bet she'll shut up about the joy of children then", "She also told her friend, \"I don't care about pregnancies,\" and that her friend's pregnancy was only important to her friend. Those are both AH things to say.", "She won\u2019t. She\u2019ll double down about how amazing it is and how OP is missing out because misery loves company. This \u201cfriend\u201d will want OP to get pregnant and have a child and suffer through it so she can have someone to commiserate with. Pure selfishness.", "Actually you're probably right."]}
