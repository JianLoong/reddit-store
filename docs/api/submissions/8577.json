I\u2019ve been living by this since I was 15. Not a lot of people want to adopt seniors because of the cost of vet services and heart ache. I\u2019ve been able to deal with both. It\u2019s not easy; but I just love them so much I\u2019m so happy with the time I have with them. It outweighs everything else. \nI was raised to do this, love them and put as much as you can until their dying day. \nRecently our dog Riley, who is coming up to 17, hasn\u2019t been doing well. I took her to the vet and we found out she has congestive heart failure. She was traumatized from the vet encounter as any old lady dog would be. Fast forward to a few weeks later and she started suddenly falling down and peeing herself out of the blue and now she\u2019s walking in circles. \nOf course I panic, and I take her to the vet.

It was difficult, but I believe I did it at the right time. It wasn\u2019t an emergency and he went peacefully. \n\nI think the way to bring it up is to not talk about the putting down part. Talk about the pain and the problems and the suffering and how you can help her be more comfortable. \n\nHer quality of life is not good. You don\u2019t want her last moments to be those of pain. You want her to be happy and peaceful and there is a way for you to help her go out like that.", "NTA If a pet has no meaningful quality of life the humane thing to do is to have it properly euthanized. No one wants to make that decision but I would never keep a pet alive for my sake, it's their well being and comfort that matters.", "NTA. \n\nPart of the responsibility of pet ownership is knowing that you might need to help your dog ease out of life at the end if they are suffering. \n\nHowever, you mention that you are able to handle the cost and heartache of adopting senior dogs. It might be that your partner has discovered that they cannot handle the heartache.", "Nta, it sounds like it would be the kindest option", "NTA. Your partner\u2019s feelings are understandable, but ultimately selfish. It\u2019s hard to say goodbye to a cherished pet, but if she\u2019s uncomfortable or in pain, she\u2019s suffering. It\u2019s a horrible decision to have to make, but it does need to be made.", "NTA\nYour partner needs to understand that this is part of being a responsible pet owner.", "NTA: I also adopt seniors, and run a rescue.\n\nWe opted to end the pain of one of our  elderly kitties. Her appointment is on Tuesday.  Like you, I did everything I could for her. But there comes a point, when the animal's quality of life supercedes any emotional attachment from the owner. It is my sweet girl's time to go, to be out of pain.\n\nYour partner needs to understand that it is time to do the same for Riley.  You have an amazing heart, and I hope your partner comes to the right decision for your good dog.", "NAH. You\u2019re learning about your partner and will figure this out together. He shouldn\u2019t have called you an AH. But I still don\u2019t want to rush to over-judge snd call him the asshole and understand how someone could hold a strong perspective on euthanasia.", "NAH - If your partner really takes the time to see Riley's quality of life, I would hope that he would see that he loves him, but wants to keep Riley for him, because the idea of letting him go is scary.  You're not a AH, you are thinking rationally about keeping Riley's suffering to a minimum.", "NTA - someone has to make the decision. It\u2019s not fair to keep her around when she\u2019s in that much confusion and pain.", "NTA. As someone who has a 16 year old dog, your post made me cry. You need to be strong for your dog and do what is best for her.\n\nI'm sending a big hug to you both.", "NTA. I know your partner is having a hard time dealing with the gravity of Riley\u2019s situation, but to be honest, he needs to be more considerate that you are hurting as well. You don\u2019t enjoy having to consider this option. As you are both adults in a mature relationship, you need to be able to sit down and have these kinds of conversations. As heartbreaking as it is for your partner, this should be a time when you both are giving each other emotional support, not calling the other an \u201casshole\u201d for being realistic about what is going on with your dog.", "NAH. It's hard losing a pet and he's not ready to think about it yet. Though he needs to figure it out because it's wrong to make a dog keep suffering which you seem to really understand luckily. \n\nIf this is going to be his reaction every time a dog stays to go downhill then maybe you need to think about if it's worth making him experience this every few years potentially. \n\nIt's great what you do. But it may not be something he is able to cope with. I'd try and figure that out before adopting any more dogs.", "It\u2019s unfortunate that your partner prefers to ignore reality, but it\u2019s your job as pet owners to be responsible enough to let them go when it\u2019s time.  \n\nIf you keep your dog alive when suffering to appease your partner, THEN you\u2019re the @$$hole. \n\nNTA", "NTA if the vet is recommending it. But i might say look I know you love the dog and don't want to lose them but it's about quality of life nobody wants to see a dog suffer so how about we take him to another vet and they suggest the dog be put down too we go ahead and do it.", "Veteran of three large dogs that made it to 15 and I've had to put two down.  I have a large 15 and a small 12 now.  They tell you.  And Riley is telling you.\n\nNTA at all, I don't know how but your partner needs to learn about caring for animals during their lifetime, especially at the end.  \n\nIt's the worst thing for you, best for them.  I'm sorry for your situation, it really sounds like your partner is not being realistic.", "NAH. It\u2019s time, but it sounds like your partner is in denial about it because putting down a pet is an absolutely horrible experience even though you know it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "NTA.  Has your partner not had pet's before?  The Rainbow Bridge is not something to be scared of.  I have cats and had to put the last two down as they were older when I adopted them.  The first one hadn't been eating, drinking or peeing for days.  I waited a couple more days and she collapsed and couldn't walk.  That was a Sunday and I took her in to be put down on Monday.  I swore I would never let that happen again.\n\nWhen my next cat appeared to be looking for a place to die, would take 10 minutes when I called her, and was wobbly on her feet, I took her right in.  \n\nIt gets easier when you realize you let your last pet suffer needlessly.  He probably doesn't have that experience.", "NTA, it anufortuante truth of having an elderly dog, but I do t think she's at that stage yet (not far off though) I've seen both sides with elderly sick pets.\n\nThe first was a rescue we had for 12 years named scruff. She had been having some incontince issues and balance problems so we took her to vets  l, she had a bone cancer and  tumor had formedat the base of her  skull, due to the location surgery would have most likely left her with facial paralysis, she was with us for over a year longer slowly getting worse until one day after getting her out of the bath she couldn't stand up. My dad made to put her down as we couldn't bare for her to suffer. He called while i was at school, i asked him to pick me up straight away as i wanted to be there as well. We took her to vet, i waited in the car with her holding her before we were called in. I'll never forget the gasp i heard heard from the waiting room as people saw me carry her in. The gave the injection as I heldher paw bawling my eyes out, she quicly drifted off to sleep and trhn stopped breating. We took her back home  a d buried her in the garden with her favourite toys. One of the hardest things I've ever gone through but I have no regrets at all over it. The experience with my parents next dog only reinforced that belief.\n\nThe second one was my parents  14 year old westie named caine he deteriorated rapidly with cancer, because of how heartbreaking it was when scruff was put down they decided not to with cain as it was too painful to go theough it again. That dog suffered until their last breath, their last days were spent whimpering in their bed. I wouldn't want anyone to go through that. \n\nI can understand your husbands point of view but I disagree with it entirely.  Ita a conversation that has to be had for your dogs sake.", "NTA. Going forward have your partner go to the vets with you so he can be there to listen to the vet explain the pain Riley is in. I think listening to an expert say something is often different to hearing it 2nd hand (even if it is quite obvious).", "NTA. Your partner needs to grow up and put the dog's quality of life above his own emotions. He should be going to the vet with you and have this explained to him if it's easier for you. Maybe hearing it from a professional will help it sink in. I get that it is tough but if he loves her then he needs to make the most humane choice.", "My old dog was 14 and had an inoperable spleen tumour, was basically on palliative care and had gradually lost weight and then stopped eating all together. I wanted to euthanise at this point but my partner wanted to give him \"one more weekend\" and go to the park one last time.  But he totally collapsed on the Thursday night, couldn't get up, couldn't control his bowels.  I stayed with him on the floor all night and the next morning got a mobile vet to our house to put him to rest.  Those last 12 hours of his life and his suffering still haunt me and I wish we hadn't let it go that far. NTA.", "NTA. You are wanting to do what is right for y'alls dog. Your partner is having a rough time with it and is honestly not handling it very well at all. They are thinking about themselves instead of the dog. Now I am not trying to call your partner an asshole. It's a hard situation to deal with.", "NAH it's a sensitive situation for both of you.", "I think he needs to go to your dogs next appointment.  Asap of course. That way he can hear first hand there's nothing to do. But let her go. Then yall can tell her goodbye.  And hold her until her last breath. And probably after for awhile too. This is always the hardest part. They love us so perfectly.  I think boyfriend might actually be ok with it then. If not. Let him go home. And do the right thing. I vote no AH here.", "NTA - there\u2019s nothing else to do and unfortunately pets will reach a time like your lady here where they let you know when it\u2019s time. You\u2019re being considerate and want her not to suffer anymore. \n\nYour partner isn\u2019t mature to deal with this and it makes them the AH. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between being sentimental/sensitive when grieving the inevitable; and out right attacking you for wanting to end\nRiley\u2019s suffering.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like he's having a hard time letting go and lashing out instead. Maybe have the vet talk with him next time, he's so buried in his emotions (truthfully so would I) a third party might put into perspective for him", "Nta, I'm sorry but he isn't being responsible like he should for his dogs if he not only refuses to see the truth of the situation but refuses to talk about it.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nI agree that Riley needs to be put down.

But it\u2019s really hard for me to see if maybe he\u2019s right to keep her alive for a little while longer. I love her too, I want her forever.

It really is losing a family member. And I\u2019m so happy you were there for them in their time of passing.", "WRONG. \n\nThis is an extremely selfish response. The poor dog is in pain. The humans pain will pass with time. He's putting his own emotions first instead of loving his dog like he should be and accepting that it's time.", "And I\u2019m so sorry about your dog. Having to say goodbye is horrible.  My vet has a bowl of Hersey kisses in his office so dogs that are about to be put down can taste chocolate before they go and I end up sobbing in my truck basically every time I go. \n\nWe also have services here that will come to your home to save your pet the vet trip. I wish I had known that before my Sophia\u2019s time came.", "I am so sorry.  I guess I would think he would be more open to not letting your dog suffer.", "He doesn't see it that way yet. He loves the dog and thinks he wants to be saved. The dog can't communicate it's wishes, so our interpretations are at best a guess.\n\nWhile I would seriously consider putting the dog down, it doesn't mean that everyone in that situation has to do the exact same thing.\n\nHe isn't ready. If OP puts the dog down anyway, it could lead to serious strain in their relationship.\n\nu/lavendrblonde\n\nHave you and your partner thought about having a timeline? For example, if the dog hasn't improved in 2 weeks, you'll consider talking about the rainbow bridge. This will give him the freedom to think about it and hopefully change his mind.\n\nHe isn't as used to the situation as you are. His emotions are clouding his judgement. Give him a little more time.", "Again, I\u2019ve had a drink now so I\u2019m sorry. But I think maybe because he\u2019s seen a lot of people just \u201cabandon\u201d that\u2019s why he thinks there is more. But I always do, and I never resort to rainbow crossing unless we\u2019ve exhausted all avenues. SOO I wonder if that\u2019s all going to hell in a hand basket now lol", "\"a little more time\" isn't always humane, as much as we might want those extra days and hours - sometimes you have to think about what's best for your pet BECAUSE they cannot communicate their needs, and you are the only person that can help them ease their pain  \ni lost my dog in july. she was my best friend and therapy dog. i loved her more than life itself. i had her for eight years. she came down with a case of pleural effusion and no amount of veterinary care was helping her. i didn't want to say goodbye to her, i wasn't ready in any form of the word, but she was put to sleep because that was what was best for her - she was in pain, she was suffering, and having her cling to a miserable life for my sake was cruel. op's dog is suffering. their quality of life is not good, which is sometime that vets look at and assess before they talk about something like euthanasia.  \ncongestive heart failure can be \"treated\" but it does eventually get so bad medications can no longer help, and it seems like op's dog has reached the point of 'no return' - it will not get better, it will just get worse. why prolong that? i wouldn't dare call that kind of behavior 'selfish' because i do get it, but it is cruel in its own way.  \npet ownership is about doing what's best for your pet, as hard as it is sometimes. they trust us with their whole lives, and we have to do right by them, even if it breaks out hearts."]}
