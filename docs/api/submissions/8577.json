She had been having some incontince issues and balance problems so we took her to vets  l, she had a bone cancer and  tumor had formedat the base of her  skull, due to the location surgery would have most likely left her with facial paralysis, she was with us for over a year longer slowly getting worse until one day after getting her out of the bath she couldn't stand up. My dad made to put her down as we couldn't bare for her to suffer. He called while i was at school, i asked him to pick me up straight away as i wanted to be there as well. We took her to vet, i waited in the car with her holding her before we were called in. I'll never forget the gasp i heard heard from the waiting room as people saw me carry her in. The gave the injection as I heldher paw bawling my eyes out, she quicly drifted off to sleep and trhn stopped breating. We took her back home  a d buried her in the garden with her favourite toys. One of the hardest things I've ever gone through but I have no regrets at all over it. The experience with my parents next dog only reinforced that belief.\n\nThe second one was my parents  14 year old westie named caine he deteriorated rapidly with cancer, because of how heartbreaking it was when scruff was put down they decided not to with cain as it was too painful to go theough it again. That dog suffered until their last breath, their last days were spent whimpering in their bed. I wouldn't want anyone to go through that. \n\nI can understand your husbands point of view but I disagree with it entirely.  Ita a conversation that has to be had for your dogs sake.", "NTA. Going forward have your partner go to the vets with you so he can be there to listen to the vet explain the pain Riley is in. I think listening to an expert say something is often different to hearing it 2nd hand (even if it is quite obvious).", "NTA. Your partner needs to grow up and put the dog's quality of life above his own emotions. He should be going to the vet with you and have this explained to him if it's easier for you. Maybe hearing it from a professional will help it sink in.

I wanted to euthanise at this point but my partner wanted to give him \"one more weekend\" and go to the park one last time.  But he totally collapsed on the Thursday night, couldn't get up, couldn't control his bowels.

Asap of course. That way he can hear first hand there's nothing to do. But let her go. Then yall can tell her goodbye.  And hold her until her last breath. And probably after for awhile too.

In return, we accept the duty of care. That includes the grief we feel when it's time to help them on their way to the next step. It hurts. It hurts so damn much every time. It's the price we pay for all that love.  I've always found the rewards to be worth the cost. I can tell you feel the same. Seems to me like your partner might not fully realize that denying the cessation of suffering to your very good girl Riley is a cruel and selfish thing to do. It doesn't matter that it's done out of love, it is still cruel and selfish. Riley was good to you both. Riley loves and trusts you both. Riley deserves to have that love and trust repaid with the final gift. It is no less than the duty your family owes to her. \n\nGood luck dealing with him in this very hard time. I'm sorry he's handling this so poorly.", "Nta. Animals know when it's close, and as pet parents we do what we can to make sure they dont suffer.

He was only 5 but his quality of life was dwindling fast.\n\nI booked into the emergency vets on the sunday, they allowed me to say goodbye before taking him to be put to sleep. He went peacefully and was out of pain.\n\nI know it will hurt your partner, but he needs to think about this seriously and look at the dogs quality of life.

( We combined households and pets- hence so many- it wasn't planned) When we felt ready for another dog, we specifically wanted a younger dog to get a break from the grief that inevitably comes with Seniors.  This decision isn't right or wrong in general- it is what is best for the humans and animals in each household.  It is far worse to adopt a Sr and then wait too long to make the euthanasia decision because you can't.", "NAH! \n\nThe most loving and kind thing we can ever do to our pet is to end it's suffering. I had to put my 16 year old dog to sleep last September and whilst I do feel absolutely terrible to have done it, I simply couldn't watch him suffer anymore. He had oral cancer which had been operated on once but appeared again within 2 weeks and had metastisized to his joints. He had lost a staggering amount of weight in recent weeks and was getting so skinny. I could actually SEE his cancer and I can't tell you how much it hurt to watch it grow. \n\nWhen I went to pick his ashes up I gave our vet a card thanking him for his efforts in helping my baby live forever and he told me my timing was perfect. He said my boy would have gone downhill very fast, as in the next few days (by the time I put Xeb to sleep he had already not eaten for 4 days) and putting him to sleep before his body couldn't handle it anymore was pure kindness. I put my baby's comfort before my own grief and he said that was a very selfless thing to do. It didn't feel like it at the time but now, now I know I did the right thing. He had suffered enough and didn't deserve more pain. He was the best dog!!!!\n\nI feel for you both, and understand you both. I am so sorry you have to go through this. I have no judgement about either of you, just sympathy for the awful situation you are both in. \n\nThanks for helping the seniors. They deserve a good life too!\n\nAnd now I'm crying.

Medication kind of helped,  but she hated the meds and i had to force them.  She was losing quality of life and to keep going would in my opinion would have been cruel.  6 months later her brother stopped eating, ultrasound showed he had a very large mass in his stomach.  Operations could have been done to prolong but no guarantee.  A few days later I made the choice.  He wasn't eating,  Paris meds kept him awake and he was becoming incontinent.  \n\nBoth times I spoke with my vet, who my family had gone to for over 20 years.  I trust her, and she said it was my choice but that maybe it was time in both cases.   If your very is suggesting it, it's time. \n\nFor how your partner is reacting, it may be denial.

But when she stopped eating (despite all coaxing) and the vet said she also had heart disease, multiple tumors, and she wouldn't send us home without painkillers, we knew it was time. It dang near killed us, but we weren't going to dope the cat up and watch her starve herself to death. Being a pet parent means hard choices, but you have to put their welfare first.

What you're describing sounds like both what we went through when he first got diagnosed and the very end before we had to have him put down.\nThe first thing that puts my red flag up is that your dog was traumatized from the vet. Just going to the vet shouldn't be traumatizing. They might want to draw blood, but all of the testing we had to do was minimally invasive for the heart failure. I would be concerned about the quality of your very if your dog is traumatized (not *stressed*); from a vet visit.\nNext, did you talk about medication and management with your vet? There are good medicines for heart failure now. Did your vet just tell you there was nothing to do? Or has your situation advanced to the point where the vet doesn't even want to try a simple medication? Because the peeing is likely 1. from fluid retention from their heart failing 2. From them browning out from lack of oxygen from the heart failure, they pass out, fall over and pee.\nIf your vet just told you that your dog is beyond therapy for this, that is unusual and very sudden. I'm not saying that's not what happened, but it would explain why your husband, who is passing familiar with veterinary science, is surprised and resistant and grieving very suddenly. Have you considered getting a second medical opinion? It might either give you options for therapy or help him come to terms with it if two separate professionals agree that you're beyond treatment.\n\nFor what it's worth, we were in the absolutely in the statistical minority who had 2 full years of good quality of life left, and at the end he started having the same issues *and* getting aggressive (the next stage of that circling behavior, which is probably confusion). And I still don't know if we chose the right time. I just know that the difference in grieving between our first senior dog who died extremely suddenly and the second where we managed his disease for a long time was very different. Having to make this choice is terrible. I wish you the best of luck either way"]}
