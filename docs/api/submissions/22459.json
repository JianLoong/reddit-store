Her asylum case is stuck ever since, there has been no movement. Now, she's marrying me, a US citizen. Most US citizens don't realize, but the US immigration system is extremely complicated and very stupid in some ways. Her marrying me possibly complicates her immigration situation a lot. As a result, we will have to hire a lawyer. The lawyer is not going to be cheap. Will probably cost us around $10k-15k when everything is said and done.\n\nIn comes my parents with their demands for a wedding. They want to have a 100 people wedding with fancy decorations and stupid shit. They want me to wear a suit with a tie. I HATE WEARING A SUIT AND A TIE. I worked hard in high school and college specifically so I could work in a place that paid well but that allowed me to wear shorts. They want to spend in total around $20k for the wedding and other associated events and stuff.

Throughout this time, my parents have insisted that they want to spend money because I am their child, and they want me to have an experience I would never forget. So I said, if they want to spend money on me, then they can actually spend money on the purpose behind the wedding: for us to have a life together where we stay together. That means paying for lawyers so that my fiance can stay here. I mean in a wedding there is so much drama over seating arrangements, who gets to wear what, what the food is going to be, etc. Also, weddings are the time most people tend to show their ego. I guarantee you that my mom would have done something that would be piss me off and my fiance and then try to blame it on my fiance. \n\nWell when I told my mother to pay for the lawyer's fees she went ballistic.

She can have a green card in less than a year, and be a citizen 3 years after that. People claiming asylum just want to get here and not get deported.

If she doesn't realize what marital status could do to your fianc\u00e9e then explain it to her. If she knows and understands fully, I have a sneaking suspicion that she doesn't like your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nMom is a smart woman. I know she like fiance. I also know she has a massive ego and likes to be the center of attention. So in that way I don't think she is making things difficult on purpose. Its just her natural ego that is coming out, as it does in everything.\n\n> What about your father? Does he like your fianc\u00e9e?\n\nDad prefers to pretend that the argument doesn't exist. He just walks out of the room whenever there is an argument. His approach is \"not my circus, not my monkeys\" which I don't like because it is his wife and his son who are arguing, so of course it has something to do with him.

In that case we might need to file a writ of mandamus that can cost $5k on its own.", "Also a nice wedding/pictures can help as supporting evidence of a real relationship.", "They are going to still question her on her asylum case in the I-485 case. US immigration, for non-white people, is neither simple, nor fast, nor cheap. Go to other immigration subreddits and you'll see what I am talking about. Even \"easy\" cases have been backlogged. And our case is not \"easy\" because she has a pending asylum case.", "This kind of status adjustment is extremely expensive, long, and difficult.", "1. There are very real reasons people are not safe in their home country that lead them to seek asylum. These reasons go beyond internationally known events like war, such as abuse, stalking, being the victim of a crime, witnessing a crime. \n2. I am not an expert so I could be wrong, but to my understanding, some people's asylum is contingent upon their participation in legal proceedings (ex: being the victim of organized crime like human trafficking).

Also, you're gonna have to be blunt with your parents and beg them for the money if you can't afford it yourselves. If her very life is in danger I hope your mother can put her ego aside because on the other end of this her ego, while a fierce one at that, might never forgive herself if something happens and she could've helped. Sure her ego might play it up, but the guilt will eat her alive when you go no contact. Which I would do if the worst happens. If they truly love you and your fianc\u00e9e they will do the right thing. Hell stroke mom's ego, make it a challenge by having her do something related so she feels like she made a difference.", "Then you don't get to redirect it for your own purposes.

But we do need to put aside the $5k for the writ of mandamus, if it comes to that. I don't want her waiting on her green card for 3 years or some stupid shit like that.

Here in Arizona, a lot of attorneys are taking people's cases, taking their money  and giving them advice that gets them deported for 10 years based on their circumstances. Marriage is a trigger for deportation in many cases. Just be sure that you get a reputable attorney who will give you factual advice. Good luck. IMO, good immigration advice is more important and valuable than a big wedding.", "He wasn't redirecting it though. He pushed back on the idea of a wedding. They kept pushing it because they want to \"give an experience op won't forget\". So he said if you really want to give money you can pay for other things. He didn't demand or anything.\n\nOp NTA", "That is redirection, precisely. He is telling them that if they want to spend the money, they should spend it on *his* priority, not theirs."]}
