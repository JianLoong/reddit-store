{"id": 29434, "submission_id": "17dpslz", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for asking my gf to clean 100% of our apartment?", "selftext": "Links: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/4UlJNHCZbZ\n\nI(30M) asked my GF(27F) if we could speak before our date night. I told her that I wouldn't expect her to do 100% of the chores, and that I would continue to do my laundry and do my dishes from Sunday, but I can't do the shared laundry or the other shared chores. She said that's it's still not fair since we both contribute to the mess of the house just by the fact we both live here.\n\nI then suggested that we cut down her allowance and use that money to pay for a cleaner once a week on Sunday so both of us would be free. She didn't complain about the drop in money here, but she said that her cleaning or a cleaner doing it made no real difference because she would want to stay at the house because she couldn't trust a stranger to clean unsupervised because she might steal something.\n\nBasically I went through a few different situations and in the end, they all resulted in the same answer by her.\n\n\nSo I broke up. I have 5 months left on this place, so I'm just going to transfer the lease over, pay the 5 months, and let her keep anything that's not explicitly mine, such as the PS5, my laptop, etc. Anything shared like the bed or TV she can keep. It doesn't matter. I'll be out in a new place in a week. I'll get a work loan to cover this but it'll be over.", "created_utc": 1697968472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dpslz/update_aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_clean_100_of_our/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Why are you giving her a bunch of free shit when you break up? This is someone who was totally unwilling to even slightly step up to support you and now you are planning to carry her finances fir 5 months when your not even dating? Take a step back and think about how many long work days that 5 months rent is, you are giving an absurd amount of your life to someone you don't even like for no reason.", "My man she was not wiling to help an ioda. If you are out of rental contract and on a rolling monthly. Give your notice  and call it  a day. It is very gentlemanly of you  to do what your proposing but honestly i would cut my losses and call it a day.", "do not take out a loan to make a break up go easier. ffs. take your shit with you, anything shared should be split evenly and if it\u2019s not hers she doesn\u2019t keep it. you found your shiny spine, now polish it up and make sure you\u2019re not fucking yourself over. and let her pay her own rent. if she can\u2019t afford it she can be the one to move.", "Man she really snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, huh?", "I love it when toxic babies like you remove yourselves from the lives of decent people. The biggest favor you\u2019re doing her is leaving her alone.", "I could do less. But I'm trying to balance out being fair since she did quit her job. What would you suggest is a more fair setup?", "Looks like GF found the post. \ud83d\ude48", "Why should you burn your self to keep her self warm?  Honestly, why pay for the five months?", "This is the only decent thing about you, bro. Since your encouragement and promise to support her is the reason she quit her job you absolutely owe her some runway.", "Love how that\u2019s your best comeback to someone having a different opinion. I supposed you also think working 60 hours is too exhausting to clean up after yourself lol", "I do think she would have quit no matter what given enough time, but we did come to the agreement together. It's not as if I called her boss on her behalf with a happy career in hand and ended everything. She was depressed in this job and wanted out.", "I have nothing to come back from. And your opinion is valid, it just reeks of hate and insult so much that if you are a random stranger not related to OP in any way, it is kind of sad.", "Grow up and don\u2019t act like promising to cover her pay wasn\u2019t the main reason she doesn\u2019t have a job right now. Also now that I have your attention: a lot of people work 60 hour weeks and still find time to clean and even raise kids. You acting like you need a full day to recover every week is pathetic.", "I don\u2019t respect OP at all. I don\u2019t respect any adult who thinks they need a full rest day and shouldn\u2019t have to clean because they work 60 hour weeks.", "Why are you so angry?", "Do we know how hard his work is. No. Do we know he is doing something really extra for his (ex)GF. Yes. (And yes, sponsoring an adult not only because of sudden loss of a job, but to quit a job and study to be more happy in future job is extra.) And here he is, taking a step back, saying he will clean after himself but expects something in return for almost not being home and paying for everything, and its still not enough. I would probably leave too if the story is exactly how he says it is. And I do clean most of my home and I do think you should split evenly but fairly based on work, children, family, hobbies, rest, etc.. \n\nI mean. It did not work for her, it did not work for him, they are not married even. They will move on.", "Why are you so lazy?", "This dude is a deadbeat and if you can\u2019t see that it\u2019s because you\u2019re a wannabe deadbeat yourself. Good day!", "Eh sure.", "Dude working 60 hours a week to support his partner in school is a \"deadbeat\". Being you must be miserable.", "You genuinely don\u2019t understand how pathetic you sound saying you need a full day to relax with your friends when you\u2019re a 30 year old adult do you?", "Nah. I genuinely think working overtime is stupid. But 60 hours is far from back breaking labor. If he can afford to keep two people afloat it\u2019s probably white collar desk work. Be real.", "I actually don't understand your point of view. Can you explain it?", "I'm in my thirties, SAHM, two toddlers, do all the house work.\n\nI get a day off with my husband covering and I do 100% of the kids so he can have a day off as well.\n\nOP isn't lazy, and you're very very aggressive. There's nothing wrong with (and affording) to enjoy a full day of relaxation. You live once on this Earth and paying for a cleaner so you can enjoy some time on it is completely shameless.", "Why are you so mad? Are you the ex? And yes I enjoy a full day of nothingness sometimes", "> But 60 hours is far from back breaking labor. If he can afford to keep two people afloat it\u2019s probably white collar desk work.\n\nWow you really just suck as a person. Like, I don't just mean that in a \"you have unnecessarily cruel and judgmental opinions\" way but also a \"are you like 15? have you ever actually worked or had a job? do you need to talk to a therapist about some problems you're having or something?????\" kind of way."]}
