I told her that I wouldn't expect her to do 100% of the chores, and that I would continue to do my laundry and do my dishes from Sunday, but I can't do the shared laundry or the other shared chores. She said that's it's still not fair since we both contribute to the mess of the house just by the fact we both live here.\n\nI then suggested that we cut down her allowance and use that money to pay for a cleaner once a week on Sunday so both of us would be free. She didn't complain about the drop in money here, but she said that her cleaning or a cleaner doing it made no real difference because she would want to stay at the house because she couldn't trust a stranger to clean unsupervised because she might steal something.\n\nBasically I went through a few different situations and in the end, they all resulted in the same answer by her.\n\n\nSo I broke up. I have 5 months left on this place, so I'm just going to transfer the lease over, pay the 5 months, and let her keep anything that's not explicitly mine, such as the PS5, my laptop, etc. Anything shared like the bed or TV she can keep. It doesn't matter. I'll be out in a new place in a week. I'll get a work loan to cover this but it'll be over.", "created_utc": 1697968472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dpslz/update_aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_clean_100_of_our/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Why are you giving her a bunch of free shit when you break up? This is someone who was totally unwilling to even slightly step up to support you and now you are planning to carry her finances fir 5 months when your not even dating? Take a step back and think about how many long work days that 5 months rent is, you are giving an absurd amount of your life to someone you don't even like for no reason.", "My man she was not wiling to help an ioda. If you are out of rental contract and on a rolling monthly. Give your notice  and call it  a day. It is very gentlemanly of you  to do what your proposing but honestly i would cut my losses and call it a day.", "do not take out a loan to make a break up go easier. ffs. take your shit with you, anything shared should be split evenly and if it\u2019s not hers she doesn\u2019t keep it. you found your shiny spine, now polish it up and make sure you\u2019re not fucking yourself over. and let her pay her own rent. if she can\u2019t afford it she can be the one to move.", "Man she really snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, huh?", "[removed]", "I could do less. But I'm trying to balance out being fair since she did quit her job. What would you suggest is a more fair setup?", "Looks like GF found the post. \ud83d\ude48", "Why should you burn your self to keep her self warm?  Honestly, why pay for the five months?", "This is the only decent thing about you, bro. Since your encouragement and promise to support her is the reason she quit her job you absolutely owe her some runway.", "Love how that\u2019s your best comeback to someone having a different opinion. I supposed you also think working 60 hours is too exhausting to clean up after yourself lol", "I do think she would have quit no matter what given enough time, but we did come to the agreement together. It's not as if I called her boss on her behalf with a happy career in hand and ended everything. She was depressed in this job and wanted out.", "I have nothing to come back from. And your opinion is valid, it just reeks of hate and insult so much that if you are a random stranger not related to OP in any way, it is kind of sad.", "[removed]", "I don\u2019t respect OP at all. I don\u2019t respect any adult who thinks they need a full rest day and shouldn\u2019t have to clean because they work 60 hour weeks.", "Why are you so angry?", "Do we know how hard his work is. No. Do we know he is doing something really extra for his (ex)GF. Yes. (And yes, sponsoring an adult not only because of sudden loss of a job, but to quit a job and study to be more happy in future job is extra.) And here he is, taking a step back, saying he will clean after himself but expects something in return for almost not being home and paying for everything, and its still not enough. I would probably leave too if the story is exactly how he says it is. And I do clean most of my home and I do think you should split evenly but fairly based on work, children, family, hobbies, rest, etc.. \n\nI mean. It did not work for her, it did not work for him, they are not married even. They will move on.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Eh sure.", "Dude working 60 hours a week to support his partner in school is a \"deadbeat\". Being you must be miserable.", "[removed]", "Nah. I genuinely think working overtime is stupid. But 60 hours is far from back breaking labor. If he can afford to keep two people afloat it\u2019s probably white collar desk work. Be real.", "I actually don't understand your point of view. Can you explain it?", "I'm in my thirties, SAHM, two toddlers, do all the house work.\n\nI get a day off with my husband covering and I do 100% of the kids so he can have a day off as well.\n\nOP isn't lazy, and you're very very aggressive. There's nothing wrong with (and affording) to enjoy a full day of relaxation. You live once on this Earth and paying for a cleaner so you can enjoy some time on it is completely shameless.", "Why are you so mad? Are you the ex? And yes I enjoy a full day of nothingness sometimes", "> But 60 hours is far from back breaking labor. If he can afford to keep two people afloat it\u2019s probably white collar desk work.\n\nWow you really just suck as a person. Like, I don't just mean that in a \"you have unnecessarily cruel and judgmental opinions\" way but also a \"are you like 15? have you ever actually worked or had a job? do you need to talk to a therapist about some problems you're having or something?????\" kind of way.", "Dude you\u2019re getting cooked LMAOOO. She completely owned you. Why are you giving her anything when she wouldn\u2019t lift a finger to help you? Are you an idiot?", "What kind of idi\u25cbt are you to give her everything? YTA to yourself.", "dont take out a loan. take the shit you paid for, you dont have to subsidize this mf anymore!", "You're giving up a lot of material goods and rent money but at least you can tell people who ask the following:\n\nYou didnt put gf on the street or send her crying back to her parents. She has 5 months of free housing to figure out how to afford the placeon her own or to find a new place. If she cant figure it out after that, thsts on her not you.", "Sounds like she\u2019s gonna need a new doormat too.", "Why are you doing this? Pay half the rent for the 5 months, let her manage the rest. Take the shared items with you. Believe me, op, you will regret paying the entire rent and giving her a bunch of free shit, after which also she would have cussed you out. Donot do things you will regret.", "Bro what are you doing lol", "Wait till she gets a new boyfriend and live in the flat you pay for with your furniture and sleep on your bed", "Sorry she turned out to be such a dead weight. Find someone who returns your generosity, whether by deed or costs.", "You do not owe her five months of rent (but honestly it's incredibly kind of you to do) but good for you", "How did she take the break up?", "I just want to say good for you! You have taken the steps to care for yourself here and that's what counts. \ud83e\udd29", "YTA\nYour entire relationship is a nightmare and likely that dynamic will never work so I wouldn't suggest trying it in another relationship. The most stable relationships I've seen that involve a stay at home partner also involve children, like mine. I take care of 100% of the house and do 100% of the work with the kids while he works during the week and then when he is off on the weekend we split everything evenly. The reason for that is because sometimes the kids and especially the toddler alone keep me from even sleeping let alone having any free time. Everyone needs a break and she's not asking you to do 50% of the chores every single day. She's asking you to help her out ONE DAY A WEEK so that she gets just the smallest amount of free time. You suggested she quit her job because she was burned out and depressed but you fail to realize that she is headed that direction again stuck doing nothing but cleaning and classes. She needs free time too. People are not meant to be stuck doing the same task over and over with no relief, that's why we started building robots to begin with. I'm glad you were mature enough to give her a grace period after you left to find another job but I hope she finds someone far better for her mental health.", "Stop it right there! Please OP, don't listen to them! I'm gonna be your girlfriend, I'm decade older than you and on probably another continent, but I'm gonna start the chores right away and I'm gonna ask for a cleaning lady ones in a blue moon. To seal the deal, you can send me your PS and we can start our beautiful romance.\n\nJoke aside, you sound like a good man and most importantly a reasonable one and in a long term the few thousand that you're gonna lose will be nothing compared with the time you lose with someone who doesn't appreciate you.", "Not saying it\u2019s right or even that it\u2019s the case, but sometimes just getting out to get peace and move on becomes more important.", "Take a page out of her book brother, do the bare minimum you are required to.", "She quit her job for herself not your benefit. Youve spoilt her too much and shes been ungrateful - not be a pushover", "Although you are partly responsible for her quitting her job (telling her you'd support her while she got additional certifications), she's the one who made the decision to quit without having enough saved up to support herself in the meantime and she's the one who refused to repay your financial generousity with her time (by taking over most of the chores).  Her greediness ended the relationship and, with it, the financial support.  She got back at least 12 hours per week of her time (going from a 40 hr/week job to 28 hr/week school) so she should have used at least some of that extra time as payment to you.\n\nIf you would feel better by leaving the furniture so you can start fresh, that's fine, but IMO you're already doing more than your share by paying all the remaining months of rent.  Paying the remaining five months rent seems a bit excessive but sometimes having a clear conscience is worth the financial burden.  Whatever you ultimately decide is fair, make sure the rent payments go directly to the landlord, not to her so she can afford the rent.  You don't want to take the chance that she doesn't pay up and the landlord decides it's easier to go after you since you're employed.", "I think you\u2019ve been far too generous but as long as you can afford it you\u2019re still much better off. She\u2019ll wake up one day and realize that she lost a generous partner, they aren\u2019t always easy to find.", "Entitled little deserve the minimum.", "[removed]", "you don't have to do that, but if you do go through with it, think of it as the cost to get an asshole out of your life for good", "Talk to the landlord and find out what they would accept but I'd suggest *at most* 90 days (3 months) of covering your part of the rent. That's enough time for her to either find a job to cover it or find another roommate. Make sure you keep in contact with the landlord so if a roommate moves in before the 90 days is up you can stop paying. A written contract is a very good idea.
