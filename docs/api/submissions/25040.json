While my other kids are normal when it comes to food, my 13-year-old has two of the most hard to deal with allergies of all time: eggs and wheat. Luckily his symptoms are and always have been on the more mild end, but he still has bad reactions when he eats these foods. On a good day he'll have headaches and just feel sick, on bad days he'll straight up puke. \n\nBecause of this I do try to avoid these foods, but because eggs and wheat are in just about everything, and I already struggle with expenses as it is with trying to help pay for my daughter's college and feeding my other kids, I usually have to end up feeding him differently than the others (for example, his sandwiches are without bread/eggs, the others get dessert while he doesn't due to eggs/wheat being in most desserts, they have more cereals and snacks to choose from because he can only eat wheat-free varieties, etc. etc.). \n\nI understand it's probably difficult for him watching his siblings snack on all types of different foods while he's relegated to specific things, but I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives when I can afford them.\n\nThe other day when I came home from work, I noticed he was having a hard time keeping down whatever it was he ate. He tried to hide it from me but it was bad enough to where I called him over and asked him what was wrong. He was a bit cagey but finally admitted he'd eaten a frozen pizza that was meant for his brothers. I gave him a scolding and told him he was denied his phone and computer for three days. \n\nMy son was of course irritated. He said he was just hungry, it wasn't that big of a deal, etc. etc. But I don't want him to get used to eating those foods, it's possible he could have had an emergency situation and I wouldn't have been around to help him. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the situation, she didn't agree with my punishment and thought it was too severe.\n\nI'm curious to get a wider range of opinions now.

Do you mean to say that there was no safe food for him to eat in the house?!", "YTA You're 13 year old son was hungry, by your own admission you struggle to provide food he can eat. Sorry not sorry, a piece of fruit and a glass of juice isn't going to cut it when you're hungry. If you don't want to deprive your other children of an array of foods to eat, you need to rework your food budget so you son has equal access to food. You punished a child because he was hungry and ate what was available and filling, that's messed up.", "YTA your child is actively choosing to make himself sick bc you\u2019re refusing to feed him and provide safe food for your literal child\u2026.. step up and be a parent instead of whatever borderline abuse this is.", "Having dietary restrictions for such common foods can be very alienating when you're young, not being able to fully participate in class pizza days, birthday parties, group hang outs, etc. It doesn\u2019t improve much as you get older, but at least an adult has full control over what they buy and eat. A teenager doesn't have that luxury. The onus is on the parent to make sure he is adequately fed, and your solution to that was to maintain a baseline diet of foods he can't eat. In other words, snacks for your other kids are a basic staple in your house, while snacks for this kid is a luxury. Can't you see how that might affect your son? Your son was so desperate that he decided that he'd rather mildly poison himself than continue to be hungry. And instead of reflecting on that, you decide to punish the kid. YTA, hard.\n\nEdit: I thought it couldn't get any worse. But upon re-reading, you say that your son tried to hide the fact that he was sick from you. In my experience, that's not the behavior of a child who feels comfortable asking his parents for help -- a belief you then confirmed by punishing him. Good God, I hate to say it, but you sound like an utter parenting failure.", "YTA for creating this situation in the first place, then punishing your kid for being a kid. Yes, he needs to learn to make responsible choices about his food. But it sounds like you\u2019re making very little effort to ensure that he\u2019s getting an equivalent range of food compared to his siblings. How can you justify having one child go without dessert while the others eat it? Having frozen pizza for two kids but not for the third? Fruit is wonderful and all kids should be eating it, but do you ACTUALLY think your thirteen year old wants to eat an apple while his siblings eat dessert or cookies or whatever?\n\nI have dietary requirements myself. I get that often appropriate foods are more expensive. But you\u2019re not being fair to this kid, and you don\u2019t seem to be exerting all that much effort on his behalf. If he can\u2019t have wheat or eggs, there\u2019s a wide range of gluten free and vegan products available in supermarkets these days which would accommodate his needs, and packaging clearly indicates whether allergens are present. If you can\u2019t afford suitable desserts for your 13 year old, why are the others getting regular desserts? Why not cut dessert back to once or twice a week so that you can afford something *everyone* can afford?", "YTA. If you aren't going to to give your 13 year old deserts he can eat, the others shouldn't get it either.\n\nHave them all eat fruit. It would be healthier", "YTA. You have a child with dietary restrictions. I get it can be hard to work around this, but you have to do better to treat all your kids equally.\n\nYour child was hungry. He ate what was available. He shouldn\u2019t be punished for that. You need more foods available in the house that are safe for him to eat and are *filling*.", "HARD YTA. Oh my goodness. It is so easy to limit his siblings options so they don\u2019t have a plethora of snacks and cereals that they can eat while he is left with the same limited options WHEN YOU CAN AFFORD THEM. \n\nsince you only buy things he can eat when you have the money, the poor kid is probably already starving. Stop prioritizing your other kids over his health.", "YTA. Feeling sick is already the natural consequence for eating food he\u2019s allergic to. He doesn\u2019t really need punishment beyond that. Rather than punish him, why not talk to him about how he ate something he knew would make him sick, and now he feels sick? Also, YTA for not giving him dessert when his siblings get it. There are plenty of wheat and egg free options, including many standard ice cream brands. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel the urge to eat food that makes him sick if you actually had adequate food he can eat.", "Yta I\u2019m sorry but feeding your 13 year old should be bigger priority then paying for your daughter\u2019 college. It sounds like your starving him. \n\nAnd I want to know what type of sandwich has no bread. And what else you feed him with that.", "YTA - he\u2019s a little kid who is just trying to feel normal. Instead of punishing him when his LIFE is already a punishment why not try to treat him every once in awhile with pizza or surgery treat he CAN eat.", "YTA for not making sure there is always SAFE food for him in the house.\nHim going hungry is absolutely NEVER ok.", "YTA - He did not chose this situation. Your reaction made him feel bad about his health and limited food choices.\n\nEmpower him to explore food options, he shops and picks out his food and find the budget to support this. This will get him invested in solutions rather than feeling left out. Doing this now is critical to his physical, social and emotional development. Work with your oldest to bring in funds for college (PT job, scholarships) in order to support your son.", "I don't like the word \"normal\" in your post.  Your son is not abnormal. He has food allergies - a medical issue beyond his control. It's not \"extras\" in your budget. It's part of your food expense. Buy him gluten-free or cauliflower pizza crust or  pizza. Buy it for everyone. Cauliflower crust is tasty.  Ask your doctor for a referral to an allergist or nutritionist who can offer you help.", "YTA. You buy/make dessert for everyone else but him?? What the hell? Dessert is 100% optional so if you can't get something for everyone don't get anything.Buy them regular stuff and keep a stash for him of Gluten free oreos, sorbet, etc...  And buy the poor kid a gluten free pizza.", "YTA. He\u2019s aware of the allergy which is great. He\u2019s aware of the price of when he chooses to ignore it. I\u2019m sure the physical pain was more than enough of a punishment. \nYou need to adjust your purchases to make sure he\u2019s not left out. Make sure there are things he can easily grab when hungry.", "YTA, \n\nMainly for not prioritizing feeding your minor child. Your post makes it clear that you provide alternatives only when you can while paying for your daughter to go to college. You have another child who will start college soon while still having a child with dietary restrictions, so then there will be two kids in college and less food for the kid with restrictions. \n\nIf you are struggling like this your daughter should be able to get some financial aid. If you are not struggling and simply aren't putting the time and energy into feeding your child that is an entirely different issue. \n\nThe kid was hungry. You grounded him for being hungry. The grounding itself isn't even a reasonable form of discipline for eating something that wasn't for him but grounding a child for hunger is disgusting.", "Wow, you're punishing a child for wanting to eat like his siblings do. I'm sure he's realized his needs are being met begrudgingly because of expense (\"I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives **when I can afford them**\"? Really? As a Redditor previously suggested, give everybody fruit!). In the meantime, he gets to watch his sibs and schoolmates eat delicious crap like pizza and cookies.\n\nYTA. His allergies and daily privations are punishment enough.", "YTA. You need to prioritize having food he can eat that's comparable to your other kids over paying for college for your daughter. Food needs outweigh school debt. Punishing him when he's just trying to find something to eat is not acceptable. You need to make some changes to what foods you bring in and how you manage his health. It's also pretty gross to get the other kids dessert and have nothing for him.", "Yta he already suffered being sick and the punishment is excessive . Eventually he will get tired of this reaction roulette and stop.", "YTA for not providing your child with enough foods he can safely eat. FFS \ud83e\udd26", "YTA\n\nYou have your kid on prison rations because you can\u2019t be bothered to feed him properly and then punish him for breakdown and eating something?!?!\n\nYTA for punishing your kid for eating something that made him sick. And you are **even bigger** AH for not ensuring he has proper food in the house. \n\nI really can\u2019t imagine as a parent handing out a dessert to my 15 and 12 year old, and then just telling the 13 year old to suck it. Like, how do you do that to a kid?!", "YTA. The allergic reaction is more than punishment enough.\n\nAs the parent, the solution is to ensure that he has an adequate amount of convenience snacks (same kind of preparation effort) that he can enjoy the same way his brothers enjoy those frozen pizzas", "YTA My kid has similar allergies. You are fucking lazy. I even bring a replacement dessert for birthday parties.", "Yta he is a kid you should talk to him not punish him. Make sure he has nice choices he likes so if he is hungry or wants a snack he has lots to choose from", "YTA.  My nieces have gluten allergies.  There are SO many gluten free snacks if you just put in the effort to look for them!  I got big boxes of Popcorners popcorn chips, SmartPop popcorn, etc on Prime Day for my son to take to school.  All of his school snacks are gluten free and peanut free just in case of an allergy.  Making sure the food in your house is safe for your child, or at least the majority of it is, is like bare minimum.  He\u2019s telling you that he doesn\u2019t want to stand out and be different, at least at home.", "YTA. As an *adult* with multiple food allergies, most on the milder side, I struggle with having restrictions while my family gets to eat anything they want. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for your 13yr old son, especially since it doesn\u2019t sound like there are always alternatives available. I totally understand why he ate that pizza. \n\nYou mention not being able to always afford to have something separate for your son. Thing is, if you can only afford one version of something, you should be buying the allergen free version. For example, rather than serve 2 kids normal sandwiches and the 3rd the fillings only, why not serve all 3 of them sandwiches made with wheat/egg free bread? Or for desert, instead of 2 kids getting ice cream and the 3rd nothing, why not serve all 3 egg-free sorbet? Same with cakes and cookies, just buy the allergen-safe versions for everyone. \n\nTrust me - the products are available, and are much more affordable than they were even 10 years ago. Even discount store like Walmart have allergen-free choices. \n\nLook at it this way: it won\u2019t hurt the rest of you to avoid eggs and wheat, whereas eating them *does* hurt your son. So if you can\u2019t afford to accommodate him separately, just default to the safe option for everyone.", "YTA. I got \"thevother\" treatment because my mother thought I was fat ( projection) where my siblings didn't have a problem. Different foods, and I had to watch them eat \"the good stuff.\" 50 plus years, and I still resent it.\n\nAllergies are different, and it's my understanding reactions can go from mild to severe without warning. You should have this discussion with him. It sounded to me like he doesn't understand the gravity.\n\nAnd I agree about not keeping snacks for the other kids that he's not allowed to have. It's teasing him with something he wants and can't have. That's xruel, and you might want to be sure your other kids aren't doing a \"Nyah, nyah, you can't have this!\" on him. If you remove \"the goodies,\" they may resent it, but I presume they're old enough to understand and feel enough of a bond with their brother that they'll make tge sacrifice. \n\nNever attach food to a punishment or reward. Never. It messes a person up.", "So you are a neglectful parent. If the school picks up that you're basically starving him to do things to benefit other kids them I wouldn't be surprised if they call cps.", "YTA.\n\nHe was punished for eating the pizza by being ill. That's straight up natural consequences. You're also an asshole for not giving your son the same food opportunities as the other kids. Everyone else gets popular junky snack foods, and he gets an apple? I think you can understand why he might want a slice of pizza when you treat him like this, can't you?", "YTA\n\nHe felt poorly what more of a \"punishment\" did he need?! He ate the food he suffered the physical consequences. What's his phone got to do with any of this?!\n\nAlso you need to make more effort to provide snacks for him as his siblings have them.  Egg and wheat free snacks exist, do some research.", "YTA he was hungry there wasn\u2019t any food for him to eat maybe your reaction is why he tried to hide it from you", "YTA\n\nYour kid was hungry. There needs to be food available that doesn't have allergens then.\n\nPunishing him for your crap parenting is a serious AH move, \"Dad\"", "YTA, he ate it because he was hungry and had few alternatives he could eat. Most supermarkets have good free from range stuff now and if you check the clearance shelves you can even find the stuff on there as well.", "YTA. If one kid has restrictions and you can\u2019t afford to buy extra stuff just for him, the solution is to make most or all of your purchases the egg/wheat free alternative versions. Duh. Not eating wheat or eggs isn\u2019t going to harm the other kids but the reverse will harm him.", "YTA. Punishment makes no sense. It\u2019s an allergy and if he was hungry\u2026I get it. You need to make sure there are ALWAYS wheat and egg free snacks and meals in your house. Messing with a not-so-severe food allergy by repeatedly triggering it can still cause long term digestive damage.\n\nYour son is 13 and should know better, but also he\u2019s 13 and wants to be normal and it\u2019s understandable. My brother went through it when he was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 15. He had a hard time not being \u201cnormal\u201d anymore and made bad decisions. You are his parent and should know even better that teens eat a lot and it is imperative that you make sure your house has equal amount of food that he can eat at all times.", "YTA\n\nA thirteen year old can be hungry a lot of the time.

You should be working WITH you kid and his doctor or a nutritionist or whatever kind of support you can access - the internet, library books, etc- to come up with foods he likes, are safe for him to eat and you can afford.  Literally every kid his age absolutely hates feeling \u201cweird\u201d or different. This could be a great opportunity to bond with him and help you both figure out ways to manage his allergies.

It wouldn't surprise me if he is being mocked during lunch time for not eating the same as everyone else.\n\nI'm actually concerned for your son's mental health, if I am being totally honest with you. He says he was hungry and ate the pizza as a result, but I think he could either be forcing himself to eat that stuff to feel \"normal\", or his situation could be so unbearable emotionally, that he is trying to eat dangerous foods in order to end his suffering in this world and to not feel like a burden (especially if you keep going on about safe foods being \"expensive\" and making him feel like a financial drain).\n\nYTA OP.

While my other kids are normal when it comes to food, my 13-year-old has two of the most hard to deal with allergies of all time: eggs and wheat. Luckily his symptoms are and always have been on the more mild end, but he still has bad reactions when he eats these foods. On a good day he'll have headaches and just feel sick, on bad days he'll straight up puke. \n\nBecause of this I do try to avoid these foods, but because eggs and wheat are in just about everything, and I already struggle with expenses as it is with trying to help pay for my daughter's college and feeding my other kids, I usually have to end up feeding him differently than the others (for example, his sandwiches are without bread/eggs, the others get dessert while he doesn't due to eggs/wheat being in most desserts, they have more cereals and snacks to choose from because he can only eat wheat-free varieties, etc. etc.). \n\nI understand it's probably difficult for him watching his siblings snack on all types of different foods while he's relegated to specific things, but I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives when I can afford them.\n\nThe other day when I came home from work, I noticed he was having a hard time keeping down whatever it was he ate. He tried to hide it from me but it was bad enough to where I called him over and asked him what was wrong. He was a bit cagey but finally admitted he'd eaten a frozen pizza that was meant for his brothers. I gave him a scolding and told him he was denied his phone and computer for three days. \n\nMy son was of course irritated. He said he was just hungry, it wasn't that big of a deal, etc. etc. But I don't want him to get used to eating those foods, it's possible he could have had an emergency situation and I wouldn't have been around to help him. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the situation, she didn't agree with my punishment and thought it was too severe.\n\nI'm curious to get a wider range of opinions now.

But all you're doing by allowing foods into the house that he cannot have when you don't always have comparable foods for him is parking temptation in front of him while setting up potential resentment toward his siblings (and when one kid has medical issues this CAN be a source of resentment and even estrangement among siblings). So no more frozen pizzas, until you ALSO have gluten free frozen pizzas for him. Keep gluten free crackers (usually make without eggs) and cheese available for him to snack on. If his brothers have dessert then he has dessert, even if you or your wife has to go to three grocery stores to find that gluten free, egg free cupcake (yes, they do exist, AND there are recipes on the Internet for gluten free, egg free cakes and cookies if you, your wife, and your son are willing to take the time to bake them).\n\nYou need to do better, OP, or you're going to have a son who's constantly sick (because he's a kid and you're putting temptation right in front of him), a kid who resents his brothers (because you do NOT make nearly enough of an effort to even things out), or both.

If you never allow him to eat those foods you\u2019re lowering his chances of growing out of his allergies. \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve said the worst thing that happens when he eats those foods is that he throws up. They\u2019re not life threatening. What\u2019s the big deal if he has pizza every once in a while?", "First off yes, YTA. Your son needs to have food that is safe for him to eat available to him. Ideally it should also be comparable to what his siblings are eating. I can say as a person with food allergies, it hurts more to watch your family eat something that you can't have than watching people outside your family do it. \n\nSecond, yes buying gluten and egg free pre-made items is more expensive than buying the standard counterparts. However, cooking from scratch is generally less expensive overall and can help offset that difference. Doubly so if you make your own wheat free flour blends, and other substitute items. It does take more time, but your son is at an age where he can provide meaningful help with this kind of task. He shouldn't be expected to prepare \\*all\\* of his own food, but just like your other kids he should be learning his way around a kitchen. This is especially true for kids with allergies because they will be doing a lot of cooking for the rest of their lives. Also get a bread machine to make bread for you, they work great and save so much time overall. You can get an inexpensive one for like $60 on amazon, totally worth it imo. Egg is really easy to sub out in baking, applesauce is a great sub for binding and it's inexpensive. Other than that the only sub for eggs I use regularly is ener-g egg replacer, it's like 10 bucks a box and the box lasts me for several years, and I do a lot of baking!\n\nBasically my point is that you have options for providing safe food for your son and you need to start exploring your options more.

The main issue isn't necessarily price - potato and rice are actually cheaper than wheat per calorie. It's more in developing new cooking habits. For example, most kids when they're hungry between the main meals might tide themselves over by throwing together a sandwich, and this constitutes some part of their daily calorie intake that an adult isn't cooking but is absolutely essential. Your son, without that option, needs to be comfortable putting a cup of rice in a rice cooker or slicing potatoes to bake in the oven.

Egg substitutes are for people on a budget but looks like OP didn\u2019t even try that. \n\nThe more I think about it the angrier I get. \n\nCooking from scratch ending up being so much cheaper than anything so I know OP is just being lazy about their food and letting 13 year old suffer.", "Um\u2026I have a 14 year old that wants to go to a super expensive university for his chosen field. So if anyone else has some good/relatively easy scholarship suggestions please leave a reply \ud83d\ude4f \n\nWe have been going through the lists but any extra help or suggestions would be AWESOME!", "My husband's absolute favorite!", "Yup. Only way I have survived my recent strep throat. At least I got the bulk box!", "We have an ice cream maker so we can make any kind we want. It wasn\u2019t expensive and is so damn easy. OP could splurge for something similar, and then the money saved by making it at home would add up, plus the fun for the kids of getting to help and tailor make their favorite combos.", "Or wine. Probably not good for a 13 year old, though.", "and i know for sure my kids would prefer the premade cups as young teens! It wouldn't even be seen as \"less than.\"", "Basic chocolate pudding:  cocoa powder, confectioners sugar, cornstarch, milk. Heat. Cool. Pudding. My dad taught me to make this one when I was a kid.", "you can use a bread machine to make pizza dough. No mess no effort just lay it in a pan and put toppings on it.  Personal pies for everyone. Hell you can even make dough in a bread machine and freeze them in flat rounds or uncooked this is all just so ridiculously easy IDK why it escapes some people. I get it if he doesn't have freezer space but so many things can be prepared for ahead of time if you are creative/spend a minute to THINK or at least as a last resort watch youtube videos talking about this exact thing.", "oh yeah Philly style that is fair", "Yes, I saw your sTatiSticalLyyyyy", "that\u2019s a very black and white view to take, it isn\u2019t a case of him getting everything or nothing, it\u2019s about accommodating a lifelong difficult condition. as a parent you can at least provide similar options so this kid isn\u2019t sat eating a freaking orange watching his siblings eat cake", "Sorbetto typically doesn't have eggs, though!", "It definitely is! \ud83d\ude02\n\n& now I\u2019m imagining lettuce wrapped pb&j and that\u2019s just nasty lol", "They weren\u2019t saying it was healthy, they were saying it\u2019s an easy cheap dessert since OP seems to think that special egg-free gluten-free desserts are too expensive or time consuming, which is why the poor kid gets nothing.", "Also, making one kid watch while their siblings get cupcakes or whatever is pretty messed up. If you can\u2019t  get treats for all of them maybe you shouldn\u2019t get treats for any of them.", "Spend the $25 for a physical copy of The Ultimate Scholarship Book.  If your kid is good with doing dozens and dozens of essays and applications, that will give you a vetted list to start from. \n\nTake the PSAT sophomore year and study for it Junior year for National Merit. Depending on where you\u2019re going, that\u2019s a couple hundred to a couple thousand to a full ride scholarship. \n\nBe done with run at the SAT/ACT by the end of first semester Junior year. Shift to getting your letters of recommendations straight.  This means take the ACT and SAT for real second semester of sophomore year so you can take test prep seriously the summer before Junior year so you can take the PSAT, and then the ACT or SAT in September or October and be done with it.\n\nStart crafting your college application story now. Your kid wants to major in something specific, somewhere specific.  There has to be a good reason and a good story there. Do stuff in support of that. Some people think that picking your activities in support of your college apps is gaming the system, but if there\u2019s a true drive behind it, that\u2019s fine. \n\nRead some of the bios of kids who win the crazy scholarships, like Gates or Robertsons Scholars (specific to Duke). That\u2019s the mold you\u2019re looking for. \n\nVisit his target school now, and listen closely to the financial aid section. Many schools have specific scholarships (like Duke) for full rides. Figure out how his target school and even his major\u2019s college within the university does it.\n\nTalk to your employers, too. Most places will have a $500-$2000 scholarship for employee kids, definitely apply for that. If your kid plans on getting a job in high school, make sure they check to see if there\u2019s any money involved there, too.", "Once he's accepted to a university,  you can talk to guidance there for any grants or scholarships that they're familiar with. Also, librarians and high school guidance may be able to help.\n\nIf he's set on his chosen industry and can pinpoint some businesses within that field, he can look into internships, summer jobs, and also scholarships they may offer, specifically if they're local or at least in the same state.\n\nDon't forget to search your friend list (people you may not talk to often but share holiday cards?) and see if there are any alums that can offer guidance.\n\nJust keep searching--they change yearly and some may pop up suddenly. Check out trade magazines specific to the field he interested in too.\n\nHe's still young but developing good relationships with teachers or admin at his school will also be a huge help.\n\nAny thing that can put him in a unique box should be considered. Race, ethnicity, medical conditions, allergies, hobbies, skills-then look for grants or scholarships in those specific areas.", "Don\u2019t forget to look into local community ones like Kiwanis, lions club, rotary club, elk/moose lodge etc. many of them have funds set aside for scholarships and some don\u2019t even get any applications. Individually they may be anywhere from $250-$1000 but if you find multiple ones they can really add up. Also look into local educational type places like a science museum may have funding for people pursuing stem fields etc. also lots of big organizations like tide, T-Mobile etc offer scholarship opportunities. And most importantly talk to the school college counselor because they usually have lists of lots of small scholarships that can be applied for.", "In the last months of my mom's life, her digestive system got really sensitive. A friend of mine suggested the Outshine popsicles, and they were a godsend.", "If the money isn't there? No you cannot. \n\nAll the people saying he should stop paying for his daughter's college are just unhinged. Setting aside that student loan debt has a bigger impact on your life than being limited to healthy dessert choices as a teen, what happens when the rest of the kids go to college? OP doesn't pay for them either out of fairness? Or only the daughter gets screwed?  That's going to do a number on the ol' family dynamic.", "The commenter said \"so delicious you can forget its healthy\"......", "No maybe about it. If there isn\u2019t enough money for all family members to be able to eat similarly than there isn\u2019t enough money AT ALL for the family. Save up for treats to get biweekly or something. None of the kids should be taught that a family member gets excluded with no effort on anyone\u2019s part.", "Agreed. And there are lots of desserts that don't have wheat or eggs. Vegan pudding, most candy bars, ice cream...\n\nAnd cereal. There are plenty that are based on corn rather than wheat. Honestly most cereal might as well be dessert because it's bad for you anyway. \n\nAlso, thanks to my southern in laws I know how to make something that's basically pancakes but made with corn meal instead of wheat flour. The texture took me a bit to get used to, but it kinda tastes like corn bread and pancakes had a baby. They can be made without eggs. The best ones had honey in the batter too! If you're going to give the other kids cereal, make something like that so he can have what's basically pancakes. Make a bunch and freeze them. Hell, teach the kid to make stuff for himself! All the kids should be able to do basic cooking by now anyway.", "And there are tonnes of baking substitutes to make things egg free. Chia seeds, mashed banana, pureed apple, a can of soda. There are heaps of vegan cake mixes and recipes. There's the classic 'Wacky Cake' recipe which is completely vegan and you can easily sub GF flour. \n\nMy daughter is allergic to dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, beef, peanuts, strawberry, buckwheat and banana. If I can make her a birthday cake and find her treats and snacks, OP can definitely do it when ALL they need to avoid is eggs and wheat. YTA.", "I can't believe this even needs to be said. My daughter recently got braces, so all her favorite gummy candies are out now. We bought her other yummy braces-friendly stuff so we never have a situation where she gets left out of dessert.", "All of this! I meant to add that about employers. My husbands company is international and offered stipends for kids and spouses in certain fields. Generally, the scholarship or grant requires certain GPA & \"major\" but they also don't follow through often if the recipient changes paths.\n\nAnd if he has a specific school, figure out which test they prefer and focus on those elements (a lot of majors have stopped requiring SAT/ACT and some have even dropped the GRE for grad programs. However, most T-10/ivy will at minimum see it as a positive if they have good scores.\n\nIt would be worth it to get a tutor and become great at essays-I have relied on essays to get into ivy undergrad/grad and law school.\n\n(And remember-It's ALL a game! An expensive, life changing one, but still a game.)", "I also disagree with the comments saying he should stop paying for his daughters college \n\naccommodating dietary stuff can be expensive but if it\u2019s proving that much an issue he should seek assistance. aquafaba and applesauce are pretty cheap egg replacements - possibly even cheaper than fruit and milk - not more essential but I\u2019m sure costs can be cut somewhere that doesn\u2019t lead to the kid eating food he\u2019s allergic to because he\u2019s hungry", "Certain ice creams do use eggs but it takes a quick look at the ingredients to find out", "Flax seed mixed 1:1 with water instead of eggs in baking works."]}
