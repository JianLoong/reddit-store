{"id": 25040, "submission_id": "15vpvf2", "title": "AITA for taking away some of my son's privileges because he deliberately ate food he's allergic to?", "selftext": "So, I have four kids, the oldest a daughter (19) and three sons (15, 13, and 12). While my other kids are normal when it comes to food, my 13-year-old has two of the most hard to deal with allergies of all time: eggs and wheat. Luckily his symptoms are and always have been on the more mild end, but he still has bad reactions when he eats these foods. On a good day he'll have headaches and just feel sick, on bad days he'll straight up puke. \n\nBecause of this I do try to avoid these foods, but because eggs and wheat are in just about everything, and I already struggle with expenses as it is with trying to help pay for my daughter's college and feeding my other kids, I usually have to end up feeding him differently than the others (for example, his sandwiches are without bread/eggs, the others get dessert while he doesn't due to eggs/wheat being in most desserts, they have more cereals and snacks to choose from because he can only eat wheat-free varieties, etc. etc.). \n\nI understand it's probably difficult for him watching his siblings snack on all types of different foods while he's relegated to specific things, but I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives when I can afford them.\n\nThe other day when I came home from work, I noticed he was having a hard time keeping down whatever it was he ate. He tried to hide it from me but it was bad enough to where I called him over and asked him what was wrong. He was a bit cagey but finally admitted he'd eaten a frozen pizza that was meant for his brothers. I gave him a scolding and told him he was denied his phone and computer for three days. \n\nMy son was of course irritated. He said he was just hungry, it wasn't that big of a deal, etc. etc. But I don't want him to get used to eating those foods, it's possible he could have had an emergency situation and I wouldn't have been around to help him. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the situation, she didn't agree with my punishment and thought it was too severe.\n\nI'm curious to get a wider range of opinions now.

And you have to ask if you\u2019re an asshole?\n\nThe rest of you won\u2019t die from eating egg and wheat free food\n\nEdit: also, wait\u2026the kid said he was hungry and that\u2019s why he are the pizza? Do you mean to say that there was no safe food for him to eat in the house?!", "[deleted]", "YTA your child is actively choosing to make himself sick bc you\u2019re refusing to feed him and provide safe food for your literal child\u2026.. step up and be a parent instead of whatever borderline abuse this is.", "Having dietary restrictions for such common foods can be very alienating when you're young, not being able to fully participate in class pizza days, birthday parties, group hang outs, etc. It doesn\u2019t improve much as you get older, but at least an adult has full control over what they buy and eat. A teenager doesn't have that luxury. The onus is on the parent to make sure he is adequately fed, and your solution to that was to maintain a baseline diet of foods he can't eat. In other words, snacks for your other kids are a basic staple in your house, while snacks for this kid is a luxury. Can't you see how that might affect your son? Your son was so desperate that he decided that he'd rather mildly poison himself than continue to be hungry. And instead of reflecting on that, you decide to punish the kid. YTA, hard.\n\nEdit: I thought it couldn't get any worse. But upon re-reading, you say that your son tried to hide the fact that he was sick from you. In my experience, that's not the behavior of a child who feels comfortable asking his parents for help -- a belief you then confirmed by punishing him. Good God, I hate to say it, but you sound like an utter parenting failure.", "YTA for creating this situation in the first place, then punishing your kid for being a kid. Yes, he needs to learn to make responsible choices about his food. But it sounds like you\u2019re making very little effort to ensure that he\u2019s getting an equivalent range of food compared to his siblings. How can you justify having one child go without dessert while the others eat it? Having frozen pizza for two kids but not for the third? Fruit is wonderful and all kids should be eating it, but do you ACTUALLY think your thirteen year old wants to eat an apple while his siblings eat dessert or cookies or whatever?\n\nI have dietary requirements myself. I get that often appropriate foods are more expensive. But you\u2019re not being fair to this kid, and you don\u2019t seem to be exerting all that much effort on his behalf. If he can\u2019t have wheat or eggs, there\u2019s a wide range of gluten free and vegan products available in supermarkets these days which would accommodate his needs, and packaging clearly indicates whether allergens are present. If you can\u2019t afford suitable desserts for your 13 year old, why are the others getting regular desserts? Why not cut dessert back to once or twice a week so that you can afford something *everyone* can afford?", "YTA. If you aren't going to to give your 13 year old deserts he can eat, the others shouldn't get it either.\n\nHave them all eat fruit. It would be healthier", "YTA. You have a child with dietary restrictions. I get it can be hard to work around this, but you have to do better to treat all your kids equally.\n\nYour child was hungry. He ate what was available. He shouldn\u2019t be punished for that. You need more foods available in the house that are safe for him to eat and are *filling*.", "HARD YTA. Oh my goodness. It is so easy to limit his siblings options so they don\u2019t have a plethora of snacks and cereals that they can eat while he is left with the same limited options WHEN YOU CAN AFFORD THEM. \n\nsince you only buy things he can eat when you have the money, the poor kid is probably already starving. Stop prioritizing your other kids over his health.", "YTA. Feeling sick is already the natural consequence for eating food he\u2019s allergic to. He doesn\u2019t really need punishment beyond that. Rather than punish him, why not talk to him about how he ate something he knew would make him sick, and now he feels sick? Also, YTA for not giving him dessert when his siblings get it. There are plenty of wheat and egg free options, including many standard ice cream brands. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel the urge to eat food that makes him sick if you actually had adequate food he can eat.", "Yta I\u2019m sorry but feeding your 13 year old should be bigger priority then paying for your daughter\u2019 college. It sounds like your starving him. \n\nAnd I want to know what type of sandwich has no bread. And what else you feed him with that.", "YTA - he\u2019s a little kid who is just trying to feel normal. Instead of punishing him when his LIFE is already a punishment why not try to treat him every once in awhile with pizza or surgery treat he CAN eat.", "YTA for not making sure there is always SAFE food for him in the house.\nHim going hungry is absolutely NEVER ok.", "YTA - He did not chose this situation. Your reaction made him feel bad about his health and limited food choices.\n\nEmpower him to explore food options, he shops and picks out his food and find the budget to support this. This will get him invested in solutions rather than feeling left out. Doing this now is critical to his physical, social and emotional development. Work with your oldest to bring in funds for college (PT job, scholarships) in order to support your son.", "I don't like the word \"normal\" in your post.  Your son is not abnormal. He has food allergies - a medical issue beyond his control. It's not \"extras\" in your budget. It's part of your food expense. Buy him gluten-free or cauliflower pizza crust or  pizza. Buy it for everyone. Cauliflower crust is tasty.  Ask your doctor for a referral to an allergist or nutritionist who can offer you help.", "YTA. You buy/make dessert for everyone else but him?? What the hell? Dessert is 100% optional so if you can't get something for everyone don't get anything.Buy them regular stuff and keep a stash for him of Gluten free oreos, sorbet, etc...  And buy the poor kid a gluten free pizza.", "YTA. He\u2019s aware of the allergy which is great. He\u2019s aware of the price of when he chooses to ignore it. I\u2019m sure the physical pain was more than enough of a punishment. \nYou need to adjust your purchases to make sure he\u2019s not left out. Make sure there are things he can easily grab when hungry.", "YTA, \n\nMainly for not prioritizing feeding your minor child. Your post makes it clear that you provide alternatives only when you can while paying for your daughter to go to college. You have another child who will start college soon while still having a child with dietary restrictions, so then there will be two kids in college and less food for the kid with restrictions. \n\nIf you are struggling like this your daughter should be able to get some financial aid. If you are not struggling and simply aren't putting the time and energy into feeding your child that is an entirely different issue. \n\nThe kid was hungry. You grounded him for being hungry. The grounding itself isn't even a reasonable form of discipline for eating something that wasn't for him but grounding a child for hunger is disgusting.", "Wow, you're punishing a child for wanting to eat like his siblings do. I'm sure he's realized his needs are being met begrudgingly because of expense (\"I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives **when I can afford them**\"? Really? As a Redditor previously suggested, give everybody fruit!). In the meantime, he gets to watch his sibs and schoolmates eat delicious crap like pizza and cookies.\n\nYTA. His allergies and daily privations are punishment enough.", "YTA. You need to prioritize having food he can eat that's comparable to your other kids over paying for college for your daughter. Food needs outweigh school debt. Punishing him when he's just trying to find something to eat is not acceptable. You need to make some changes to what foods you bring in and how you manage his health. It's also pretty gross to get the other kids dessert and have nothing for him.", "Yta he already suffered being sick and the punishment is excessive . Eventually he will get tired of this reaction roulette and stop.", "YTA for not providing your child with enough foods he can safely eat. FFS \ud83e\udd26", "YTA\n\nYou have your kid on prison rations because you can\u2019t be bothered to feed him properly and then punish him for breakdown and eating something?!?!\n\nYTA for punishing your kid for eating something that made him sick. And you are **even bigger** AH for not ensuring he has proper food in the house. \n\nI really can\u2019t imagine as a parent handing out a dessert to my 15 and 12 year old, and then just telling the 13 year old to suck it. Like, how do you do that to a kid?!", "YTA. The allergic reaction is more than punishment enough.\n\nAs the parent, the solution is to ensure that he has an adequate amount of convenience snacks (same kind of preparation effort) that he can enjoy the same way his brothers enjoy those frozen pizzas", "YTA My kid has similar allergies. You are fucking lazy. I even bring a replacement dessert for birthday parties.", "Yta he is a kid you should talk to him not punish him. Make sure he has nice choices he likes so if he is hungry or wants a snack he has lots to choose from", "YTA.  My nieces have gluten allergies.  There are SO many gluten free snacks if you just put in the effort to look for them!  I got big boxes of Popcorners popcorn chips, SmartPop popcorn, etc on Prime Day for my son to take to school.  All of his school snacks are gluten free and peanut free just in case of an allergy.  Making sure the food in your house is safe for your child, or at least the majority of it is, is like bare minimum.  He\u2019s telling you that he doesn\u2019t want to stand out and be different, at least at home.", "YTA. As an *adult* with multiple food allergies, most on the milder side, I struggle with having restrictions while my family gets to eat anything they want. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for your 13yr old son, especially since it doesn\u2019t sound like there are always alternatives available. I totally understand why he ate that pizza. \n\nYou mention not being able to always afford to have something separate for your son. Thing is, if you can only afford one version of something, you should be buying the allergen free version. For example, rather than serve 2 kids normal sandwiches and the 3rd the fillings only, why not serve all 3 of them sandwiches made with wheat/egg free bread? Or for desert, instead of 2 kids getting ice cream and the 3rd nothing, why not serve all 3 egg-free sorbet? Same with cakes and cookies, just buy the allergen-safe versions for everyone. \n\nTrust me - the products are available, and are much more affordable than they were even 10 years ago. Even discount store like Walmart have allergen-free choices. \n\nLook at it this way: it won\u2019t hurt the rest of you to avoid eggs and wheat, whereas eating them *does* hurt your son. So if you can\u2019t afford to accommodate him separately, just default to the safe option for everyone.", "YTA. I got \"the other\" treatment because my mother thought I was fat ( projection) where my siblings didn't have a problem. Different foods, and I had to watch them eat \"the good stuff.\" 50 plus years, and I still resent it. It also negatively affected my eating habits when I was no longer under parental control.\n\nAllergies are different, and it's my understanding reactions can go from mild to severe without warning. You should have this discussion with him. It sounded to me like he doesn't understand the gravity.\n\nAnd I agree about not keeping snacks for the other kids that he's not allowed to have. It's teasing him with something he wants and can't have. That's cruel, and you might want to be sure your other kids aren't doing a \"Nyah, nyah, you can't have this!\" on him. If you remove \"the goodies,\" they may resent it, but I presume they're old enough to understand and feel enough of a bond with their brother that they'll make the sacrifice. \n\nNever attach food to a punishment or reward. Never. It messes a person up.", "So you are a neglectful parent. If the school picks up that you're basically starving him to do things to benefit other kids them I wouldn't be surprised if they call cps.", "YTA.\n\nHe was punished for eating the pizza by being ill. That's straight up natural consequences. You're also an asshole for not giving your son the same food opportunities as the other kids. Everyone else gets popular junky snack foods, and he gets an apple? I think you can understand why he might want a slice of pizza when you treat him like this, can't you?", "YTA\n\nHe felt poorly what more of a \"punishment\" did he need?! He ate the food he suffered the physical consequences. What's his phone got to do with any of this?!\n\nAlso you need to make more effort to provide snacks for him as his siblings have them.  Egg and wheat free snacks exist, do some research.", "YTA he was hungry there wasn\u2019t any food for him to eat maybe your reaction is why he tried to hide it from you", "YTA\n\nYour kid was hungry. There needs to be food available that doesn't have allergens then.\n\nPunishing him for your crap parenting is a serious AH move, \"Dad\"", "YTA, he ate it because he was hungry and had few alternatives he could eat. Most supermarkets have good free from range stuff now and if you check the clearance shelves you can even find the stuff on there as well.", "YTA. If one kid has restrictions and you can\u2019t afford to buy extra stuff just for him, the solution is to make most or all of your purchases the egg/wheat free alternative versions. Duh. Not eating wheat or eggs isn\u2019t going to harm the other kids but the reverse will harm him.", "YTA. Punishment makes no sense. It\u2019s an allergy and if he was hungry\u2026I get it. You need to make sure there are ALWAYS wheat and egg free snacks and meals in your house. Messing with a not-so-severe food allergy by repeatedly triggering it can still cause long term digestive damage.\n\nYour son is 13 and should know better, but also he\u2019s 13 and wants to be normal and it\u2019s understandable. My brother went through it when he was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 15. He had a hard time not being \u201cnormal\u201d anymore and made bad decisions.

You should be working WITH you kid and his doctor or a nutritionist or whatever kind of support you can access - the internet, library books, etc- to come up with foods he likes, are safe for him to eat and you can afford.  Literally every kid his age absolutely hates feeling \u201cweird\u201d or different. This could be a great opportunity to bond with him and help you both figure out ways to manage his allergies.

It wouldn't surprise me if he is being mocked during lunch time for not eating the same as everyone else.\n\nI'm actually concerned for your son's mental health, if I am being totally honest with you. He says he was hungry and ate the pizza as a result, but I think he could either be forcing himself to eat that stuff to feel \"normal\", or his situation could be so unbearable emotionally, that he is trying to eat dangerous foods in order to end his suffering in this world and to not feel like a burden (especially if you keep going on about safe foods being \"expensive\" and making him feel like a financial drain).\n\nYTA OP.

While my other kids are normal when it comes to food, my 13-year-old has two of the most hard to deal with allergies of all time: eggs and wheat. Luckily his symptoms are and always have been on the more mild end, but he still has bad reactions when he eats these foods. On a good day he'll have headaches and just feel sick, on bad days he'll straight up puke. \n\nBecause of this I do try to avoid these foods, but because eggs and wheat are in just about everything, and I already struggle with expenses as it is with trying to help pay for my daughter's college and feeding my other kids, I usually have to end up feeding him differently than the others (for example, his sandwiches are without bread/eggs, the others get dessert while he doesn't due to eggs/wheat being in most desserts, they have more cereals and snacks to choose from because he can only eat wheat-free varieties, etc. etc.). \n\nI understand it's probably difficult for him watching his siblings snack on all types of different foods while he's relegated to specific things, but I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives when I can afford them.\n\nThe other day when I came home from work, I noticed he was having a hard time keeping down whatever it was he ate. He tried to hide it from me but it was bad enough to where I called him over and asked him what was wrong. He was a bit cagey but finally admitted he'd eaten a frozen pizza that was meant for his brothers. I gave him a scolding and told him he was denied his phone and computer for three days. \n\nMy son was of course irritated. He said he was just hungry, it wasn't that big of a deal, etc. etc. But I don't want him to get used to eating those foods, it's possible he could have had an emergency situation and I wouldn't have been around to help him. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the situation, she didn't agree with my punishment and thought it was too severe.\n\nI'm curious to get a wider range of opinions now.

So no more frozen pizzas, until you ALSO have gluten free frozen pizzas for him. Keep gluten free crackers (usually make without eggs) and cheese available for him to snack on.

If you never allow him to eat those foods you\u2019re lowering his chances of growing out of his allergies. \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve said the worst thing that happens when he eats those foods is that he throws up. They\u2019re not life threatening. What\u2019s the big deal if he has pizza every once in a while?", "First off yes, YTA. Your son needs to have food that is safe for him to eat available to him. Ideally it should also be comparable to what his siblings are eating. I can say as a person with food allergies, it hurts more to watch your family eat something that you can't have than watching people outside your family do it. \n\nSecond, yes buying gluten and egg free pre-made items is more expensive than buying the standard counterparts. However, cooking from scratch is generally less expensive overall and can help offset that difference. Doubly so if you make your own wheat free flour blends, and other substitute items. It does take more time, but your son is at an age where he can provide meaningful help with this kind of task. He shouldn't be expected to prepare \\*all\\* of his own food, but just like your other kids he should be learning his way around a kitchen. This is especially true for kids with allergies because they will be doing a lot of cooking for the rest of their lives. Also get a bread machine to make bread for you, they work great and save so much time overall. You can get an inexpensive one for like $60 on amazon, totally worth it imo. Egg is really easy to sub out in baking, applesauce is a great sub for binding and it's inexpensive. Other than that the only sub for eggs I use regularly is ener-g egg replacer, it's like 10 bucks a box and the box lasts me for several years, and I do a lot of baking!\n\nBasically my point is that you have options for providing safe food for your son and you need to start exploring your options more. If you have questions about allergy safe cooking feel free to ask me! I have a lot of experience especially with egg allergies (egg, peanut, and peppers are my allergies) and I've done a little bit of wheat free stuff.", "3 days is extreme for this even if a punishment is valid, which I dont think it is.

The main issue isn't necessarily price - potato and rice are actually cheaper than wheat per calorie. It's more in developing new cooking habits. For example, most kids when they're hungry between the main meals might tide themselves over by throwing together a sandwich, and this constitutes some part of their daily calorie intake that an adult isn't cooking but is absolutely essential. Your son, without that option, needs to be comfortable putting a cup of rice in a rice cooker or slicing potatoes to bake in the oven.

He probably doesn't really know what is happening in his body and it would be helpful to find detailed pictures/diagrams about the damage it is causing. And talk about how to handle a bad reaction (including what drugs to take and when to take them and when it is time to call 911).  \n\nBUT the solution to this specific incident is not to punish the kid but to talk to him. He said he was hungry, so talk with him about why he choose a pizza he knew would make him sick. If you don't have teen-appropriate snacks for him that's on you.

If you look at frozen pizza,  for example,  at Walmart a Daiya brand pizza,  which is vegan (egg free) and gluten free  is $7.68 for a single pizza that will feed 1 teenager.

After a particularly bad reaction as a pre-teen, all things apple were lumped into the \"*Never Eat Again Ever Category*\", along wuth shellfish and nuts. \n\nI am now in my mid-late 30s, and a couple years ago, I made the fully informed, premeditated, conscious decision to *try* 1/2 a teaspoon of apple pie filling left over from a cook out my husband and I hosted. Why?? Because: 1) I was honestly curious if I was still allergic to them since i hadn't had so much as a taste of apple [or even a product containing apple juice] in over 20 years,  and, 2) as silly as it may seem, I suddenly realized that litterally could not remember how an apple tasted [once again, it had been over 20 years]. So, i thought about it,  thought about the fact that it wasn't an anaphylaxis reaction before, thought about the fact that the type of reaction 20 years ago wasnt a guarantee of the type of reaction I might have now. *Really*  thought about it for over two hours. Then, I took 2 Benedryl 45 min in advance, and tried it. The Oral Allergy Syndrome is still there... but now, so is my memory of what apple tastes like.\n\nNow, was this logically a stupid decision?? Yes!! But, FWIW, do I understand why I made that decision?? Also, Yes!! Would I have done that with my more severe Shellfish allergy that I carry an EpiPen for?? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Would I ever condone, sanction, or encourage anyone to take such a dumb risk?? Also, Absolutely NOT.  But my point is, even as a well informed, educated, adult with impulse control  who is capable of considering risks/consequences, I chose [with forethought and intention] to taste the pie filling.  \n\nSo, of course I can understand why a 13 year old might eat something on the forbidden allergy list, particularly when they are constantly surrounded by, smelling, and watching others enjoy that food. The lack of understanding from the parent makes me wonder if that parent has any concept as to the self-control and maturity they are expecting of their child, particularly when the childs has to watch siblings enjoy desert when they dont have a safe food option if their own. It also makes me wonder if the parent would *actually* be able to maintain the same level of self control day in and day out that they expect from their child. But thats another thing entirely. \n\nThe thing that *greatly* concerns me here, is that the CHILD TRIED TO HIDE WHAT THEY HAD DONE!! [Likely because they knew they would be punished]. I  hope someone else points that out to OP somewhere on this thread where they will see it. THE CHILD TRIED TO HIDE THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF THEIR ALLERGIC REACTION FROM THEIR PARENT!! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 OP, right THERE is your sign!!\n\nIf you weren't already the AH for lack of food safe options while others enjoy treats, you are a HUGE, ENORMOUS,  LOST SITE OF THE FOREST FOR THE TREES, INDISPUTABLE A$$ WHOLE for whatever dynamic you have created with your child, that they would try to HIDE that from you... and quite obviously it is because they correctly predicted that they would be punished,  rather then simply being able to tell their parent information that the parent litterally needs to know for the childs wellbeing.\n\nOP, I'm sure you wont even see this comment, but if you do, PLEASE read that again as many times as it takes for it to sink in. Wouldn't ingesting a FOOD ALLERGERN [on purpose or not] be something you would want your child to confide in you about?? Particularly when they are experiencing a reaction??\n\nBecause here is the thing. When i decided, as a grown ass adult, to take a foolish risk and taste the pie filling, I did a few things before hand. I put my EpiPens in arms reach, I took Benedryl in advance, and I TOLD MY HUSBAND EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO SO THAT HE KNEW AHEAD OF TIME.... JUST\ud83d\udc4f. IN\ud83d\udc4f. CASE\ud83d\udc4f.\n\nMy Lord and my God. How does that aspect of this story just go right over OPs head?? They are more focused on not wanting their child to \"start\" eating those types of food, to be worried about what they *should* be worried about.  \n\nLook, i get it. Having food allergies is serious and having a child with food allergies is scary. I was 7 years old the first time i gave myself an EpiPen injection during anaphylaxis, so believe me, I understand that.  But as scary as it was, if I had ever broken the rule and snuck something that I was not supposed to have [which I never did], it would have *never* even have occurred to me that: \"Oh no! I am having a reaction!! I am going to be in  trouble if Mom finds out\". Quite the opposite, my *first* thought would have been: \"Oh no!! I am having a reaction!! I need to go tell Mom immediately!\". \n\nOP, ask yourself which of those two response do you want your child to have? Now ask yourself, if the way you reacted to this situation is congruent with the response you want your child to make in the future. Because, I am thinking that it probably isnt. \n\nPoint being:  If you dont want him to be tempted, keep temptation out of the house, and, IF you dont want your child to risk their medical wellbeing by keeping you oblivious to an active reaction, then make yourself a safe place to go if a reaction is happening *regardless* of fault/blame. The fault, blame, and poor choices are things you deal with with *later*... by TALKING THROUGH the reasons for the bad decision, reinforcing the dangers of that decision to your child, and by coming up with ways to prevent whatever led your child to that decision in the future.", "And to ensure that OP needs to switch his family over to a more rice based diet.

There are SO many gluten free options out there now a days. Yes they can be a little bit more expensive or take time to make but its worth it to have a sense of normalcy. But heck, OP you're paying for college for your adult child, so forget food that your minor child literally NEEDS to not have a reaction. /s if you couldn't tell...\n\nSounds like poor kid was hungry so ate what was there and knew there would be consequences on his body and he ate it anyways AND then you punish him on top of that? For 3 days??? Holy shit, yikes. I think you're so far out of line it isn't even funny.\n\nI think paying for your daughter's college over getting your son food he can eat is pretty awful when he is 13 and can't do anything himself and she is 19. Have her get a job or honestly get some loans if you can't do both. I really hope all the comments help you reflect OP because this is truly awful and you are the asshole.", "This. The idea that one kid\u2019s needs are \u201cextra\u201d and therefore can be ignored when budget is tight is so dangerous and unfair.", "She's also teaching him bad lessons such as to sneak food and not let mum find out. She could also be setting herself up for a power struggle with him over what he can eat which won't be good for his health.", "Hell, there is practically a vegan and gluten-free renaissance going on in the grocery world lately and...they don't even keep sorbet on hand?  Yikes.", "Another pretty easy and yummy to make is chinese mango pudding no wheat or eggs\n\nOnly needs evaporated milk, mango puree, sugar, and gelatin (add fresh mango chunks if you want)", "Can confirm, it sucked as a kid, still sucks even as an adult", "I think op is the asshole, but as someone who grew up with allergies, I don\u2019t know about this. You get used to other people eating things you can\u2019t and missing out of birthday cake and snacks and shit all the time. I always had to reassure people I didn\u2019t care and kinda hated when they made a big deal over little things like dessert. As long as I\u2019m fed, it\u2019s fine. I hate it when people baby me over this and have since I could talk. \n\nThat\u2019s not the case in this post at all as it seems like he doesn\u2019t have food at all to eat in the house sometimes. But it\u2019s weird to me that this is where people are getting hung up.", "Vietnamese rice noodles are a great cheap alternative. My kids will eat them like spaghetti Bolognese.", "Fuck that. That mom sucks for that", "Exactly.\nBianka Zapatka and Minimalistbaker have vegan and gluten free recipes.", "The other kids shouldn\u2019t be restricted to just fruit, but OP shouldn\u2019t be buying dessert for only three of their kids if they can\u2019t afford a safe alternative dessert for the one with allergies. They don\u2019t need to eat the exact same thing; they just all need to have equal options. There are plenty of desserts out there for people with allergies; OP just needs to budget for them or stop buying desserts until they can afford them.", "Take a Benadryl. It should help\u2026", "The real question is why not rice? It\u2019s like the cheapest carb there is. OP could even make good old fashioned rice pudding for dessert. I have multiple food allergies (including eggs) and it isn\u2019t inherently expensive to cook tasty, healthy food. It\u2019s not a budget issue- my parents had no money when I was little but we always ate well and this was before substitutes were even available. \n\nExpensive substitutes make life easier, and I do indulge in them, but there\u2019s no reason why OP can\u2019t make chicken, salad and a baked potato or a gluten free stir fry using tamari with rice/rice noodles or beef stew with mash using cornstarch slurry as a thickener (and these are just what I can think of off the top of my head). \n\nOP is just lazy- it\u2019s cheaper and easier to make things that are naturally wheat and egg free for everyone where possible instead of buying two sets of everything. Similarly, baking economical desserts from scratch is much cheaper long term than buying store bought.", "Rye bread very often does have wheat, you CAN make it without, but that is far from the norm", "Even if they aren\u2019t going literally hungry, the fact that they are prioritizing buying snacks with allergens over buying things their child with allergies can eat is fucked up", "No where did it say there was no other food available.", "Talento and Halo are also very expensive if you\u2019re on a budget.", "Correction: Rye MAY be an option if you know where to look. If not, make your own. Either way, where there's a will there's a way.", "These microscholarships you speak of sounds like exploited labor.", "I'm not losing the main point at all here. Read my comments again. The main point here is that OP has limited funds and is directing that limited amount of money towards the wrong kids for non essential things whilst depriving their child with allergies of sufficient and appropriate nourishment. Dessert for the other kids and higher education for an adult child do not constitute essentials and this needs to be said. \n\nI do think the son's mental health is something of concern here, given that he willingly ate something which could trigger a life threatening allergic reaction (as allergies can go from mild to deadly at any time).", "I have food allergies as well\u2026soy,fish,coconut,banana,kiwi\u2026some are mild\u2026others cause anaphylaxis. You do adjust. It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019ve tried very hard at all.", "And it's not that difficult to find things without wheat and egg. Gluten free frozen pizza isn't that difficult to find, and maybe the parents should just learn to cook", "I believe it\u2019s called \u201c custard\u201d if it has eggs in it."]}
