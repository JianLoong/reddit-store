While my other kids are normal when it comes to food, my 13-year-old has two of the most hard to deal with allergies of all time: eggs and wheat. Luckily his symptoms are and always have been on the more mild end, but he still has bad reactions when he eats these foods. On a good day he'll have headaches and just feel sick, on bad days he'll straight up puke. \n\nBecause of this I do try to avoid these foods, but because eggs and wheat are in just about everything, and I already struggle with expenses as it is with trying to help pay for my daughter's college and feeding my other kids, I usually have to end up feeding him differently than the others (for example, his sandwiches are without bread/eggs, the others get dessert while he doesn't due to eggs/wheat being in most desserts, they have more cereals and snacks to choose from because he can only eat wheat-free varieties, etc. etc.). \n\nI understand it's probably difficult for him watching his siblings snack on all types of different foods while he's relegated to specific things, but I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives when I can afford them.\n\nThe other day when I came home from work, I noticed he was having a hard time keeping down whatever it was he ate. He tried to hide it from me but it was bad enough to where I called him over and asked him what was wrong. He was a bit cagey but finally admitted he'd eaten a frozen pizza that was meant for his brothers. I gave him a scolding and told him he was denied his phone and computer for three days. \n\nMy son was of course irritated. He said he was just hungry, it wasn't that big of a deal, etc. etc. But I don't want him to get used to eating those foods, it's possible he could have had an emergency situation and I wouldn't have been around to help him. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the situation, she didn't agree with my punishment and thought it was too severe.\n\nI'm curious to get a wider range of opinions now.

Do you mean to say that there was no safe food for him to eat in the house?!", "YTA You're 13 year old son was hungry, by your own admission you struggle to provide food he can eat. Sorry not sorry, a piece of fruit and a glass of juice isn't going to cut it when you're hungry. If you don't want to deprive your other children of an array of foods to eat, you need to rework your food budget so you son has equal access to food. You punished a child because he was hungry and ate what was available and filling, that's messed up.", "YTA your child is actively choosing to make himself sick bc you\u2019re refusing to feed him and provide safe food for your literal child\u2026.. step up and be a parent instead of whatever borderline abuse this is.", "Having dietary restrictions for such common foods can be very alienating when you're young, not being able to fully participate in class pizza days, birthday parties, group hang outs, etc. It doesn\u2019t improve much as you get older, but at least an adult has full control over what they buy and eat. A teenager doesn't have that luxury. The onus is on the parent to make sure he is adequately fed, and your solution to that was to maintain a baseline diet of foods he can't eat. In other words, snacks for your other kids are a basic staple in your house, while snacks for this kid is a luxury. Can't you see how that might affect your son? Your son was so desperate that he decided that he'd rather mildly poison himself than continue to be hungry. And instead of reflecting on that, you decide to punish the kid. YTA, hard.\n\nEdit: I thought it couldn't get any worse. But upon re-reading, you say that your son tried to hide the fact that he was sick from you. In my experience, that's not the behavior of a child who feels comfortable asking his parents for help -- a belief you then confirmed by punishing him. Good God, I hate to say it, but you sound like an utter parenting failure.", "YTA for creating this situation in the first place, then punishing your kid for being a kid. Yes, he needs to learn to make responsible choices about his food. But it sounds like you\u2019re making very little effort to ensure that he\u2019s getting an equivalent range of food compared to his siblings. How can you justify having one child go without dessert while the others eat it? Having frozen pizza for two kids but not for the third? Fruit is wonderful and all kids should be eating it, but do you ACTUALLY think your thirteen year old wants to eat an apple while his siblings eat dessert or cookies or whatever?\n\nI have dietary requirements myself. I get that often appropriate foods are more expensive. But you\u2019re not being fair to this kid, and you don\u2019t seem to be exerting all that much effort on his behalf. If he can\u2019t have wheat or eggs, there\u2019s a wide range of gluten free and vegan products available in supermarkets these days which would accommodate his needs, and packaging clearly indicates whether allergens are present. If you can\u2019t afford suitable desserts for your 13 year old, why are the others getting regular desserts? Why not cut dessert back to once or twice a week so that you can afford something *everyone* can afford?", "YTA. If you aren't going to to give your 13 year old deserts he can eat, the others shouldn't get it either.\n\nHave them all eat fruit. It would be healthier", "YTA. You have a child with dietary restrictions. I get it can be hard to work around this, but you have to do better to treat all your kids equally.\n\nYour child was hungry. He ate what was available. He shouldn\u2019t be punished for that. You need more foods available in the house that are safe for him to eat and are *filling*.", "HARD YTA. Oh my goodness. It is so easy to limit his siblings options so they don\u2019t have a plethora of snacks and cereals that they can eat while he is left with the same limited options WHEN YOU CAN AFFORD THEM. \n\nsince you only buy things he can eat when you have the money, the poor kid is probably already starving. Stop prioritizing your other kids over his health.", "YTA. Feeling sick is already the natural consequence for eating food he\u2019s allergic to. He doesn\u2019t really need punishment beyond that. Rather than punish him, why not talk to him about how he ate something he knew would make him sick, and now he feels sick? Also, YTA for not giving him dessert when his siblings get it. There are plenty of wheat and egg free options, including many standard ice cream brands. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel the urge to eat food that makes him sick if you actually had adequate food he can eat.", "Yta I\u2019m sorry but feeding your 13 year old should be bigger priority then paying for your daughter\u2019 college. It sounds like your starving him. \n\nAnd I want to know what type of sandwich has no bread. And what else you feed him with that.", "YTA - he\u2019s a little kid who is just trying to feel normal. Instead of punishing him when his LIFE is already a punishment why not try to treat him every once in awhile with pizza or surgery treat he CAN eat.", "YTA for not making sure there is always SAFE food for him in the house.\nHim going hungry is absolutely NEVER ok.", "YTA - He did not chose this situation. Your reaction made him feel bad about his health and limited food choices. \n\nEmpower him to explore food options, he shops and picks out his food and find the budget to support this. This will get him invested in solutions rather than feeling left out. His condition is primary to his physical, social and emotional development. Work with your oldest to bring in funds for college (PT job, scholarships) in order to support your son.", "I don't like the word \"normal\" in your post.  Your son is not abnormal. He has food allergies - a medical issue beyond his control. It's not \"extras\" in your budget. It's part of your food expense. Buy him gluten-free or cauliflower pizza crust or  pizza. Buy it for everyone. Cauliflower crust is tasty.  Ask your doctor for a referral to an allergist or nutritionist who can offer you help.", "YTA. You buy/make dessert for everyone else but him?? What the hell? Dessert is 100% optional so if you can't get something for everyone don't get anything.Buy them regular stuff and keep a stash for him of Gluten free oreos, sorbet, etc...  And buy the poor kid a gluten free pizza.", "YTA. He\u2019s aware of the allergy which is great. He\u2019s aware of the price of when he chooses to ignore it. I\u2019m sure the physical pain was more than enough of a punishment. \nYou need to adjust your purchases to make sure he\u2019s not left out. Make sure there are things he can easily grab when hungry.", "YTA, \n\nMainly for not prioritizing feeding your minor child. Your post makes it clear that you provide alternatives only when you can while paying for your daughter to go to college. You have another child who will start college soon while still having a child with dietary restrictions, so then there will be two kids in college and less food for the kid with restrictions. \n\nIf you are struggling like this your daughter should be able to get some financial aid. If you are not struggling and simply aren't putting the time and energy into feeding your child that is an entirely different issue. \n\nThe kid was hungry. You grounded him for being hungry. The grounding itself isn't even a reasonable form of discipline for eating something that wasn't for him but grounding a child for hunger is disgusting.", "Wow, you're punishing a child for wanting to eat like his siblings do. I'm sure he's realized his needs are being met begrudgingly because of expense (\"I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives **when I can afford them**\"? Really? As a Redditor previously suggested, give everybody fruit!). In the meantime, he gets to watch his sibs and schoolmates eat delicious crap like pizza and cookies.\n\nYTA. His allergies and daily privations are punishment enough.", "YTA. You need to prioritize having food he can eat that's comparable to your other kids over paying for college for your daughter. Food needs outweigh school debt. Punishing him when he's just trying to find something to eat is not acceptable. You need to make some changes to what foods you bring in and how you manage his health. It's also pretty gross to get the other kids dessert and have nothing for him.", "Yta he already suffered being sick and the punishment is excessive . Eventually he will get tired of this reaction roulette and stop.", "YTA for not providing your child with enough foods he can safely eat. FFS \ud83e\udd26", "YTA\n\nYou have your kid on prison rations because you can\u2019t be bothered to feed him properly and then punish him for breakdown and eating something?!?!\n\nYTA for punishing your kid for eating something that made him sick. And you are **even bigger** AH for not ensuring he has proper food in the house. \n\nI really can\u2019t imagine as a parent handing out a dessert to my 15 and 12 year old, and then just telling the 13 year old to suck it. Like, how do you do that to a kid?!", "YTA. The allergic reaction is more than punishment enough.\n\nAs the parent, the solution is to ensure that he has an adequate amount of convenience snacks (same kind of preparation effort) that he can enjoy the same way his brothers enjoy those frozen pizzas", "YTA My kid has similar allergies. You are fucking lazy. I even bring a replacement dessert for birthday parties.", "Yta he is a kid you should talk to him not punish him. Make sure he has nice choices he likes so if he is hungry or wants a snack he has lots to choose from", "YTA.  My nieces have gluten allergies.  There are SO many gluten free snacks if you just put in the effort to look for them!  I got big boxes of Popcorners popcorn chips, SmartPop popcorn, etc on Prime Day for my son to take to school.  All of his school snacks are gluten free and peanut free just in case of an allergy.  Making sure the food in your house is safe for your child, or at least the majority of it is, is like bare minimum.  He\u2019s telling you that he doesn\u2019t want to stand out and be different, at least at home.", "YTA. As an *adult* with multiple food allergies, most on the milder side, I struggle with having restrictions while my family gets to eat anything they want. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for your 13yr old son, especially since it doesn\u2019t sound like there are always alternatives available. I totally understand why he ate that pizza. \n\nYou mention not being able to always afford to have something separate for your son. Thing is, if you can only afford one version of something, you should be buying the allergen free version. For example, rather than serve 2 kids normal sandwiches and the 3rd the fillings only, why not serve all 3 of them sandwiches made with wheat/egg free bread? Or for desert, instead of 2 kids getting ice cream and the 3rd nothing, why not serve all 3 egg-free sorbet? Same with cakes and cookies, just buy the allergen-safe versions for everyone. \n\nTrust me - the products are available, and are much more affordable than they were even 10 years ago. Even discount store like Walmart have allergen-free choices. \n\nLook at it this way: it won\u2019t hurt the rest of you to avoid eggs and wheat, whereas eating them *does* hurt your son. So if you can\u2019t afford to accommodate him separately, just default to the safe option for everyone.", "YTA. I got \"thevother\" treatment because my mother thought I was fat ( projection) where my siblings didn't have a problem. Different foods, and I had to watch them eat \"the good stuff.\" 50 plus years, and I still resent it.\n\nAllergies are different, and it's my understanding reactions can go from mild to severe without warning. You should have this discussion with him. It sounded to me like he doesn't understand the gravity.\n\nAnd I agree about not keeping snacks for the other kids that he's not allowed to have. It's teasing him with something he wants and can't have. That's xruel, and you might want to be sure your other kids aren't doing a \"Nyah, nyah, you can't have this!\" on him. If you remove \"the goodies,\" they may resent it, but I presume they're old enough to understand and feel enough of a bond with their brother that they'll make tge sacrifice. \n\nNever attach food to a punishment or reward. Never. It messes a person up.", "So you are a neglectful parent. If the school picks up that you're basically starving him to do things to benefit other kids them I wouldn't be surprised if they call cps.", "YTA.\n\nHe was punished for eating the pizza by being ill. That's straight up natural consequences. You're also an asshole for not giving your son the same food opportunities as the other kids. Everyone else gets popular junky snack foods, and he gets an apple? I think you can understand why he might want a slice of pizza when you treat him like this, can't you?", "YTA\n\nHe felt poorly what more of a \"punishment\" did he need?! He ate the food he suffered the physical consequences. What's his phone got to do with any of this?!\n\nAlso you need to make more effort to provide snacks for him as his siblings have them.  Egg and wheat free snacks exist, do some research.", "YTA he was hungry there wasn\u2019t any food for him to eat maybe your reaction is why he tried to hide it from you", "YTA\n\nYour kid was hungry. There needs to be food available that doesn't have allergens then.\n\nPunishing him for your crap parenting is a serious AH move, \"Dad\"", "YTA, he ate it because he was hungry and had few alternatives he could eat. Most supermarkets have good free from range stuff now and if you check the clearance shelves you can even find the stuff on there as well.", "YTA. If one kid has restrictions and you can\u2019t afford to buy extra stuff just for him, the solution is to make most or all of your purchases the egg/wheat free alternative versions. Duh. Not eating wheat or eggs isn\u2019t going to harm the other kids but the reverse will harm him.", "YTA. Punishment makes no sense. It\u2019s an allergy and if he was hungry\u2026I get it. You need to make sure there are ALWAYS wheat and egg free snacks and meals in your house. Messing with a not-so-severe food allergy by repeatedly triggering it can still cause long term digestive damage.\n\nYour son is 13 and should know better, but also he\u2019s 13 and wants to be normal and it\u2019s understandable. My brother went through it when he was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 15. He had a hard time not being \u201cnormal\u201d anymore and made bad decisions. You are his parent and should know even better that teens eat a lot and it is imperative that you make sure your house has equal amount of food that he can eat at all times.", "YTA\n\nA thirteen year old can be hungry a lot of the time.

You should be working WITH you kid and his doctor or a nutritionist or whatever kind of support you can access - the internet, library books, etc- to come up with foods he likes, are safe for him to eat and you can afford.  Literally every kid his age absolutely hates feeling \u201cweird\u201d or different. This could be a great opportunity to bond with him and help you both figure out ways to manage his allergies.

It wouldn't surprise me if he is being mocked during lunch time for not eating the same as everyone else.\n\nI'm actually concerned for your son's mental health, if I am being totally honest with you. He says he was hungry and ate the pizza as a result, but I think he could either be forcing himself to eat that stuff to feel \"normal\", or his situation could be so unbearable emotionally, that he is trying to eat dangerous foods in order to end his suffering in this world and to not feel like a burden (especially if you keep going on about safe foods being \"expensive\" and making him feel like a financial drain).\n\nYTA OP.

While my other kids are normal when it comes to food, my 13-year-old has two of the most hard to deal with allergies of all time: eggs and wheat. Luckily his symptoms are and always have been on the more mild end, but he still has bad reactions when he eats these foods. On a good day he'll have headaches and just feel sick, on bad days he'll straight up puke. \n\nBecause of this I do try to avoid these foods, but because eggs and wheat are in just about everything, and I already struggle with expenses as it is with trying to help pay for my daughter's college and feeding my other kids, I usually have to end up feeding him differently than the others (for example, his sandwiches are without bread/eggs, the others get dessert while he doesn't due to eggs/wheat being in most desserts, they have more cereals and snacks to choose from because he can only eat wheat-free varieties, etc. etc.). \n\nI understand it's probably difficult for him watching his siblings snack on all types of different foods while he's relegated to specific things, but I try to balance it out by providing a lot of fruit, milk, juices, and wheat-free, egg-free alternatives when I can afford them.\n\nThe other day when I came home from work, I noticed he was having a hard time keeping down whatever it was he ate. He tried to hide it from me but it was bad enough to where I called him over and asked him what was wrong. He was a bit cagey but finally admitted he'd eaten a frozen pizza that was meant for his brothers. I gave him a scolding and told him he was denied his phone and computer for three days. \n\nMy son was of course irritated. He said he was just hungry, it wasn't that big of a deal, etc. etc. But I don't want him to get used to eating those foods, it's possible he could have had an emergency situation and I wouldn't have been around to help him. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the situation, she didn't agree with my punishment and thought it was too severe.\n\nI'm curious to get a wider range of opinions now.

I feel bad for him. I would not have punished him. Have you explored more things that he can eat? For example, I make homemade granola with oats, nuts, dried fruit pieces (usually craisins or sour cherries), dried coconut and a honey with cinnamon. It's delicious and much cheaper than store-bought cereal. Just look for a gluten-free label on the oatmeal. Some may have traces of gluten as a result of manufacturing cross contamination. \n\nFor desserts, consider making your you son homemade pie filling with a variety of fruits. It is much cheaper to make your own and it freezes well. \n\nThere are so many great gluten and dairy free recipes available now.
