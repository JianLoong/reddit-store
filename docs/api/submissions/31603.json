I\u2019m in my early 20s now and have moved around a few times and eventually lost it. A couple months ago I was on facetime with my mom and saw her wearing the necklace, so I asked where she found it. She laughed at me and said the necklace was hers and she found it laying around the house. She would not believe me when I said it was mine and a gift from my grandpa, telling me that he never bought jewelry for anyone and the chain even turned colors so obviously was just junk. \n\nI got increasingly frustrated that she wouldn\u2019t  believe me and was unwillingly to give it back to me as it has sentimental value to me and means nothing to her. I even tried to \u201cprove\u201d it by naming the brand inscribed on the back of the pendant, but she still said it was always hers even though she said she couldn\u2019t remember when she bought it. \n\nFor extra context, my mom and my dad had a messy divorce and she also hates my grandpa, who passed away less than a year ago. Now I get so annoyed when I see her wearing it and avoid asking again because I can\u2019t stand to argue with her over a necklace. \n\nI\u2019m back at my moms house for thanksgiving and I saw it laying on the bathroom counter, so I grabbed it and put it in my suitcase but I feel so guilty knowing she will notice and ask me where it went, in which case I\u2019d have to lie or cause an argument by telling the truth.\n\nShould I just put it back in the bathroom and try to let it go?", "created_utc": 1700799416, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182jcde/aita_for_taking_my_necklace_back_from_my_mom/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would have done the same. However, you might want to consider going low contact with your mom. Sounds like an unhealthy relationship and taking the necklace will not make it better.", "Your mom stole it from you. You just took back what is rightfully yours. NTA.", "NTA. Do you have any photos of your wearing the necklace from before you lost it? And, since she left it on the bathroom counter, you could just turn her words back around on her and say it's yours and you found it laying around the house.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like she had a guilty conscience laugh more than anything. \n\nTake it and don't answer her when she invariably asks you the next time you talk to her. Hide it and lock it up somewhere. If she gets mad, then go LC.", "Gaslight her back when she asks\nNta", "NTA It's your necklace and turn about is fair play. If she ever sees you wearing it in the future just tell her this is your necklace. It always has been. You don't know where *her* necklace is. This isn't it.\n\nDon't buy in to the gaslighting. You can't steal your own necklace. You are retrieving your stolen item. It never became your mother's necklace. There is nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA\nWhat you should do is get your dad to find some things written by grandpa and have a friend write you a 10th birthday card in grandpa\u2019s handwriting that mentions and describes the necklace. \n\nThat\u2019s a first tier recovery strategy. You can stop here and simply \u201cfind\u201d the card and show your mom. Or\u2026\n\nTier 2, keep the necklace. Throw away the chain. Go buy a nice silver chain to match the pendant. Get the pendant cleaned and polished and buy a cheap jewelry box like it may have come in. Now when your mother calls asking if you know what happy to her necklace you can say you have no idea but you hope she finds it. Then tell her you\u2019re sorry for doubting her, that necklace was definitely hers after all because look, you found the one Grampa gave you packed away with the birthday card and everything. And look, they don\u2019t even look alike!\n\nI promise she will look at it and agree they are different.", "If you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the same necklace then NTA", "NTA\n\nDon't say anything to her, and do not ever wear it around her. If your dad is still around, you might want him to make some kind of statement (maybe get it notarized) that it is from his side of the family and belongs to you. If there was a copy of the will, even better. \n\nGo over your belongings and see if anything else has come up missing during your last move or two, it's possible you only know about this one because your mom was careless enough to slip and show you. Maybe she wore it to test how violently you would react, hoping she could use a lack of reaction as proof it wasn't 'really yours'. \"Well, she said it was hers, but when I proved it wasn't, she let it go! Had it really been OP's she'd have proven it and come over and taken it!\"\n\nTake ti home and either lock it in a combination safe, or put it in a deposit box in the bank, possibly even getting it insured.", "So either your mother is gaslighting you out of some residual anger towards her ex-father in law, or she has legitimate reason to believe you\u2019d be lying about, based on past offenses. Or, I suppose, she\u2019s losing her memory and/or believed it is a similar-looking necklace that she actually did own.\n\nAssuming that you\u2019re a generally honest person, I guess I\u2019d want to know if there have been other instances of your mother being manipulative, particularly disrespectful towards your father in front of you, or invalidating your feelings?", "NTA if you\u2019re 100% it is yours i\u2019d even support just not telling her the truth if she asks just say you found it but that would be a bit more of an asshole move", "NTA. when she asks say \"I honestly have no idea where your sapphire necklace is. \" \"I did not take your necklace. \" \nNot a lie if the necklace you took wasn't hers.", "NTA. It is yours, she is a thief. And knows it. Leave with the necklace.\n\nAs for the guilt - some parents are very good at training their kids to blindly obey no matter what, and feel guilty if they don't, even when they know the parent is wrong or abusive. She had 18 years to train you to feel like that. Breaking that pattern is hard. It is up to you to now get a backbone and stand up to your lying thief of a mother.", "NTA Why do you feel guilty taking back your own property? She should've given it back instead of putting you in this situation.", "NTA OP.", "NTA. She knew very well it wasn't hers. But she lied about it and lied to your face. Don't give it back, but don't wear the necklace around her or she'll try to take it back.", "NTA - what's yours is yours, your parents do not have unilateral authority to steal from you.", "NTA. It was your necklace, and the fact she knew this and denied it *while she was wearing it* says nothing good about her. She knew she was hurting you but didn't care enough to apologize or try to make it right.", "NTA \n\nI'm on sort of the same boat. I was 12 when my paternal grandmother gave me a gorgeous 2line emerald ring (the emeralds would go well with my ginger hair she said) \n\nWell, mum took it off me saying \"your 12 you'll lose it\" and now won't give it back. \nIt's getting to the point I'm going to go LC with my mum because she cares more about keeping something of mine as her than giving me what's mine. \n\nYour NTA OP", "NTA find an old pic of you wearing it for when you need proof", "ESH.

Maybe a picture with you wearing it sometime in the past. \n\nTwo: Maybe try the conversation again with your mom, calmly, and come at it from the point of view that you\u2019re not as concerned about the necklace as you are hurt that she didn\u2019t believe you, and you don\u2019t understand why. Explain to her that receiving the necklace from your grandfather is a vivid memory for you\u2014 easier if you can say something about the day you go it, like \u201cwe were over at his house, back when he had the green carpet, and I remember that his dog was still alive because he was sniffing the wrapping paper\u2026\u201d (just an example)\u2014 and that you\u2019re confused as to why she would be so insistent that it\u2019s hers when you know it\u2019s not, and/or possibly concerned about her memory? \n\nThe point is to leave the physical idea of getting the necklace back out of it for the time being, and address the emotional issue.\n\nEdit, to include: keep in mind, if she doesn\u2019t respond well to THAT conversation and continues to gaslight you, it may be time to take a hard look at your relationship and check to see if there have been other instances of manipulation. Better to start figuring this out in your mid-twenties than later on when it could potentially affect your future family. Reddit is littered with stories about manipulative mothers and mothers-in-law.", "This^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI would give you gold if I could, friend \ud83c\udfc5"]}
