He doesn't live with us anymore and he came over looking for something else and asked if he could take the books as well and my mom said it was fine knowing they were my books and how much they meant to me as a kid. When I got home I noticed a huge gap in the bookshelf and instantly knew which ones were missing so I asked her about them and she said she didn't think I would care... those were literally the ONLY childhood books I kept and wanted to have to give to my own children some day because they were my favorite books growing up. I confronted my brother about it and he said \"well some of them are mine anyway I remember buying the special edition dummy one\" and I said \"yeah you bought it and gave it to me for Christmas when we were kids one year...\" and he refuses to give them back and says that they must not matter to me too much if I just left them on the bookshelf... I'm sorry but bookshelves are meant to display books, what exactly should I have been doing with 20+ year old paperback books??? I'm still really upset about this especially because he doesn't even read!!! He didn't even like them growing up!!! He has no connection to them at all other than getting one over on me by taking something he KNEW was important to me. For reference I have 2 younger brothers and the one who took my books is the most argumentative asshole I've ever met and will NEVER ever ever admit when he's wrong so I doubt I'm ever going to see those books again even though they were mine and I'd taken care of them and planned on giving them to my own children someday. Fuck that. If I had a key to his house I'd go take them back myself. This type of shit makes me so angry especially when they KNOW it doesn't belong to them and KNOW it's something sentimental to you. It's like they want to hold it over our heads or something like fuck I'm getting upset all over again LOL"]}
