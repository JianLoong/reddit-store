She asked for a pi\u00f1a colada. I made her one and garnished it with a sliver of fresh pineapple that she watched me cut. \n\nShe took a big swig of it and spit it out and started coughing and spluttering. She said she was allergic to pineapple. I was worried so I asked if she had an epi pen or if I needed to call 911. She said no and asked me why I would serve her something that had pineapple.  I asked her why she would drink something garnished with pineapple. I asked if she didn't know what pineapple looked like. She screamed at me that of course she knew what a pineapple looked like and that she wasn't r******d. I held up the fruit that she watched me cut up and asked her if she was sure about those two statements. \n\nBy this time my dad had come over to see what was up. My aunt said I tried to poison her with pineapple and called her that word. I said I hadn't use it at all. I said she said she wasn't that and all I did was asked if she was sure. \n\nMy dad spit out his drink and said I was being a smartass and that I had to apologize. I did. And I made it sound sincere. I didn't even say I was sorry that an adult who is allergic to pineapple should probably not drink a drink named after that fruit and is garnished with a piece of it.  \n\nMy dad takes to me afterwards and said that he knew his sister was a handful but that I was a dick for fanning the flames in that situation. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689773958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153vcf4/aita_for_asking_my_aunt_if_she_was_sure_she_wasnt/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If there was literally pineapple on the drink, she should know better than to drink it. Further, if you are allergic to something, it is your responsibility to avoid it, not everyone else's responsibility to not serve it to you.", "NTA. She asked for a drink without asking what was in it. She saw you cut the pineapple. She saw you garnish her drink. She then took a gulp of the drink. Then she claimed to be allergic. When asked if she knew what  pineapple looked like she used that slur. I can totally understand why you asked.  You were a smart ass though.  That's my kind of person. You are awesome.", "NTA - if an adult that is allergic to pineapple doesn't know what it looks like, or asks if it might be in a tropical drink, she is a royal AH!!!", "NTA. Not a single thought went through her mind as she picked up that drink with a slice of fucking pineapple on the rim.", "NTA. But please be gentle to people with the IQ of a pineapple.", "NTA\n\nlol your aunt just wanted to cause drama and saw you as an easy target", "Lol, NTA - laughing with you, she's obnoxious but really funny (in a delulu way)", "NTA, but your aunt is, and so is your dad for making you apologize. Next party just refuse to serve her anything but water.", "NTA.\n \nHow does someone, as an adult, not know what the pi\u00f1a in pi\u00f1a colada means?\n \nI'm just picturing someone with a peanut allergy getting mad when the PBJ that they ordered nearly kills them.", "NTA. All you did was ask if she was sure about her statements.", "lol NTA i don't understand what she was thinking", "NTA. She's the one throwing around slurs. Funny how it's always the people who do that who can't take having their ignorance thrown back in their face.", "NTA. She watched you cut up the pineapple and put it on top. Even if you didn't know that Pi\u00f1a means pineapple, she would have seen that it involves pineapple while you were making it. She was the one that brought up that she wasn't r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*d, not you. You were just matching her energy.", "NTA. It sounds like your dad has learned to coddle your aunt to keep the peace. He needed to tell her to act like an adult and exercise some common sense.", "INFO: Why did dad spit out his drink? Is this a thing where you live?", "NTA \n\nlmao this is hilarious.\n\nAlso my husband is allergic to pineapple and a few other fruits. He gets an itchy throat and will *very* occasionally get some hives. And that's considered on the more severe end. Your Aunt sounds like an irritating person.", "NTA\n\nYour response just returned hee energy.", "NTA - I have a feeling that your aunt likes to be the center of attention.  Being truly allergic to pineapple is rare.", "NTA ugh. I know someone allergic to coconut and she's had several reactions because she NEVER asks what in the dish. She got mad at me because I'd made chocolate covered coconut for someone else and asked the person if she could try one.  Came over to give me a ration of shit - I asked her how on earth would I know she was allergic to it??? Honestly I wouldn't have apologized.", "NTA. If your dad knows his sisters a pain why didn\u2019t he back you up to correct her shitty behavior/bullying? Why\u2019s the onus on you to accommodate her a-holeness.", "NTA, and for me that's mostly because you did (seemingly) sincerely apologize. She did all the wrong things imo (including using that word) and you still apologized to stop it from getting worse. That was a kind thing to do for your dad. It wasn't necessary for you to do, but does show a kindness inside of you. Your aunt sounds awful tho lmao. Again, **NTA.**", "NTA: Sometimes relatives are... special... is she really allergic? DOesn't sound like it tbh. Probably just thinks about the tingling you get when eating pineapple", "Oh man, I have this exact aunt and every time we get together I struggle not to say something like this. You\u2019re my hero.

That's probably where my ability was honed.\"", "NTA  \n\n\nFathom watching someone cut something up in front of you and garnishing yor drink with it, and then thinking it's someone else's fault that you drank it... Whether or not she is actually allergic doesn't even enter into it.", "NTA. OP is hilarious, and that is totally the word I would have used to describe her aunt in the 90's. Ah, 30 years of sensitivity training really has changed our society.\n\nedit: added \"aunt\" for clarity", "ESH\n\nYou're both massive AHs for using that word as a slur, and for equating being intellectually disabled with being stupid.\n\nPeople who have intellectual or developmental disabilities aren't idiots - yes, sometimes they have intellectual limitations, but they're far more complex than just \"being stupid\" in the manner that your aunt was. Calling someone r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*d is not only disgusting and hateful, it's ignorant AF and shows how limited YOUR intellect is.\n\nESH for perpetuating the idea that a word denoting intellectual disability is an appropriate way to insult someone. Do better.", "ESH. I'm a special education teacher. Using that word is very similar to using any other slurs. If she used the N word would you have responded that way.
