She is also eating other food while she's away so the groceries are additionally irrelevant to her. You being willing to replace the groceries if need be also makes her request ridiculous. \n\nI would ask if she's having anxiety about finances, how much she can contribute to the relationship, or if she feels like you buying the groceries takes away from her fulfillment. It seems like maybe this is about something else but hopefully easily resolved.\n\ngood luck!", "NTA - food unless it\u2019s tinned usually had dates it\u2019s recommended to be consumed by\u2026 also it\u2019s so wasteful to just avoid the food you have for no reason? Like if it\u2019s yours and you want it\u2026 eat it imo.", "NTA , idk what to say tbh that's just an absurd thing to say smh", "NTA. This is ridiculous. Do you really want to live this sort of life? I sure as hell wouldn't do it. This is how roommates who don't really like each other act, not how you treat your SO regardless of the income difference. In my life, SO would come home to having 100% of the bills and food to pay for as I would be gone. Life's too short.", "Lmao the audacity did it for me \ud83d\udc80\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell her you agree as soon as you go back to 50/50 with ALL costs.", "NTA\n\nThat request is indeed unreasonable and from the looks of it the as well as your partnership will have an expire date if you won't talk about it soon.\n\nPS: English is neither my 1st nor 2nd Language so excuse my mistakes", "nta - if she didn't want you to eat the food in the house while she is out of town, she should have just not bought any food, or only bought enough for while she was in town. To ask you not to eat what is already there is crazy. So is she going to ask for reductions of everything else too while she is gone? like the rent/electric/cable etc?", "NTA. This seems extremely odd. Why move in together as a couple if you aren\u2019t even willing to share some food items?", "You\u2019re a cohabitating couple, not just some college dorm roommates who were randomly assigned. If you share the bills, you ought to share the food. NTA", "NTA. This is a very strange and VERY petty request. It's giving me passive aggressive roommate vibes, not significant other vibes.", "NTA but I do think the nature in which the topic was brought up (ie. how, especially attitude wise) might have played a role. Could it be possible she might feel this way as she\u2019s going on a trip and wants to have a bit more \u201cfun money\u201d and this is how she thinks it\u2019s possible to do so? Maybe. I feel like it\u2019s best to just talk it out and see both POVs and come up with something that works for both of you. Maybe suggest not buying as much groceries", "Ask her if she thinks it would acceptable have to stop staying in the home and using the utilities or using whatever you paid for if you were leaving town and you were not using the things you paid for?", "NTA this is a preview of your future, that what you want?", "NTA\n\nFlag 1 - but a medium flag not a red one. The fact that you had to come and ask means you knew saw a little crazy. But your town is more outraged that she thinks it\u2019s logical than a discomfort. \n\nBut please, get her a book or 2.", "NTA that\u2019s so incredibly selfish. What does she do to take care of you? Is she not appreciative of what you do for her? I could not imagine that level of nickel and diming a loved one. I\u2019d want them to eat and not worry about a week old groceries", "Maybe you should take a trip and turn off the power while you\u2019re gone.  NTA", "NAH while it sounds weird, I think she might have a food insecurity trauma. She has a finite budget, is trying to live within her budget and not mooch off of your bought food.", "It sounds like she has some financial insecurity, and is worried about resources. Perhaps you need to work out a different sort of split of the expenses where she does not feel so vulnerable. Whether this particular food should be eaten or not is window dressing on the bigger problem.\n\nIf these happen to be special foods, like things imported from a different country or special birthday gift foods or something, then absolutely leave them alone. If they are special to her and not to you, leave them for her. If it's just regular food, then .... Whatever. But I guarantee that the problem here is not what food you do or do not eat. Look for the big picture.\n\nEither NAH, or ESH. I don't have enough information to know which it is.", "I don\u2019t know about you but if I know my other half isn\u2019t going to be here, as part of the regular shop I will plan solo meals (whether that be cooking, having a cheeky takeaway). I wouldn\u2019t eat a meal we had planned to eat together mainly because it messes up portions if I eat half of it solo and then they come back and then who is going to eat the other half. I can kind of see why she might be annoyed if you were ruining planned meals, but equally you are in the house and need to eat", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On the surface it seems like a bizarre request, so there's obviously something else driving this.\nFinancial stress maybe?\n\nSounds like a calm chat is needed in order to get to the bottom of things, especially if everything else is going well.", "NTA\n\nBut I would talk to her to understand were that really came from. Is she struggling with money wherever she is?", "NTA", "NTA your doing  80/ 20 so money shouldn't be a problem for her", "This isn't about groceries.\nIt's money, the trip, or something else.", "NTA. Time to go to a 50/50 split on financial responsibility.\n\nRemember a prenup if you guys ever get married, this reeks of a \u201cWhat\u2019s yours is ours and what\u2019s mine is mine\u201d mentality from GF", "NTA.  Time for her to move out and pay for all her own things in her own place.", "NTA \n\nIf you pay the electricity and go away, do you expect her to live in total darkness while you\u2019re gone, since you pay the electricity for THE TWO OF YOU TO SHARE?\n\nIf you pay the rent, does she have to move out while you\u2019re away so it\u2019s \u2018only for the two of you\u2019?\n\nI kind of get her logic in a weird way but at the same time, she likely benefits a lot from your arrangement, even when it doesn\u2019t benefit you. She\u2019s being ridiculous.", "Nta, I mean, if you normally covered the hydro or water bills and went away for a week would she be expected to pay for those things while she's the only one using them? I doubt it.", "I understand that it may be a financial issue, as this is her first time out of the bird nest with actual bills to deal with aside from $100 in rent and a car payment. But I set it up in a way that each of our portions of the bill still leaves money left in 1 paycheck and leaves the entirety of the second paycheck free for savings/fun money.  I've explained that that puts us in a good spot still, but I know she's not accustomed to not having less than 90% of her income to spend freely.", "No financial advisor would recommend a 50/50 split for partners making significantly different salaries.\n\nSplitting according to percentage of earnings is far more common and advisable. \n\nAlso, it can often be the case that the higher earner pushes for a higher standard of living without realizing it (or fully realizing it) and then expects the lower earner to subsidize these choices out of their lack\u2026which is completely unfair and even borders on financially abusive. Especially likely to happen if the lower earner is a younger female who doesn\u2019t know how to speak up for herself yet\u2026which sounds like it could be the case here. \n\nOP \u2014 you\u2019re NTA and it sounds like you\u2019ve got your finances set up very fairly. However, I wouldn\u2019t assume your GF is the AH either. Consider that inflation is at record highs and food has been more quickly and noticeably affected than more stable/controlled costs like mortgages and utility bills.\n\nPerhaps her costs have gone up significantly and she\u2019s been too nervous to talk to you about it.", "If she were in charge if the electric and gas bill instead of groceries, would she tell you to stop using the electric and heat while she was gone? I would hope not.\n\nMaybe you two could adjust the arrangement a little bit to make it easier and more predictable for her. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
