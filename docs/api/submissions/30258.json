She is also eating other food while she's away so the groceries are additionally irrelevant to her. You being willing to replace the groceries if need be also makes her request ridiculous. \n\nI would ask if she's having anxiety about finances, how much she can contribute to the relationship, or if she feels like you buying the groceries takes away from her fulfillment.

Especially likely to happen if the lower earner is a younger female who doesn\u2019t know how to speak up for herself yet\u2026which sounds like it could be the case here. \n\nOP \u2014 you\u2019re NTA and it sounds like you\u2019ve got your finances set up very fairly. However, I wouldn\u2019t assume your GF is the AH either.

The thing is you don't want to do that. You like your place, you like your life, you want to spend the money you make. That means she can't live with you or she's gonna need help. Which you do. Which makes sense. \n\nThe part that makes me think something is wack here is that you do EVERYTHING for her.... Like cooking, you do it because you're better at it. Shopping, you do it because you're better at it. Cleaning, you do it because you're better at it. Managing most of the bills, you pay more because you make more... There doesn't seem to be a single axis in which you find her level of effort or ability equal to your own.... And you chalk that up to 'its her first time living away from home' but also 'you like things done the way you like them done.' \n\nThat's a bad recipe in any long term relationship. You do everything, it's always framed as because you're better at it, she's never doing any of the stuff and it's because she's worse than you... It just sounds like a great way to make sure she never gets better at stuff she isn't great at but needs to do as an adult and also a great way to make her feel completely incompetent. Then there is you, because you're going to get burned out in this relationship. You can't do everything forever for both of you.\n\nIf you just want to take care of someone and have them put in a nominal effort and amount then I think you need to accept the price of wanting to care for someone to this degree means being with someone who doesn't feel any compulsion to put in the same effort toward you. And if that's your jam, than I'm not sure why you're surprised at her comment. If that's not your jam, than I think it's time ya all talk about how she is your equal and what the long term plan for her behaving like your equal is. Unless this is a temporary \"I have no time and you carry me so I can carry us later situation\" something is wack... Because you do make it sound like she contributed nothing to your life.", "Nta.

Do you guys make a list together?", "NTA. I am curious how that works out though. Your rent or mortgage payments must be high for food to fall on her side of the 80/20 bill split. Then again it\u2019s just for two people but monthly food costs tend to be second only to housing costs for me. \n\nHonestly I would take a look at your relationship dynamic because this situation is making me think your gf feels that the split is not equitable. Without knowing all the financial details and amount of unpaid labor that goes around the household it is difficult to say if she has a reason to feel this way. \n\nEither way it seems there is an underlying cause for her to feel this way.

It's not my fault or her fault that I have a job that pays more. \n\nEven if I lived in this place alone yes I would be able to manage it, but that doesn't mean she gets to live absolutely bill free. That's also not fair to me. The wage gap isn't so grand that I'm a cheap asshole, it's more so that she's never had real big bills and the fact that she now no longer has all 90% of her money to spend freely is a shock to her.", "Food insecurity trauma....wow time to get off reddit", "Wondering about this too.

But the way I see it, I pay 90% percent of the rent so she doesn't have to which in turn means, she gets the cheaper bills and I don't have to worry about groceries.\n\n The way I see it, if I can't eat the food and have to go out and buy more, then she has to pay more rent. I pay $1500 of $1800 rent. She pays for groceries: $250mth, utilities:$200, and rent:$300 month. So I don't think her total of $750 to my $1500 is unfair.", "Why? If groceries are her bills, why should I buy more? Mind you I'm not a gluttonous beast that'll devour everything and treat her like an AYCE buffet, but I'm also not going to go out and buy separate groceries when there's food to be cooked in our fridge just because she's not there. In addition, if it's even relevant, we each agreed to separate our junk food and treats into our own individual spending. Her idea not mine. I'm fine with it she's likes junk food more than I do.

I'm primarily the cook so I'm better at shopping for ingredients to last us and am more cost effective in my approach as well.

It benefits YOU to do an income based split too... You know why? Because you didn't choose to live DOWN to her budget where she could be comfortable paying 50/50 you chose to live UP to your budget where if she had to pay 50/50 she wouldn't be financially stable. \n\nI am deeply curious about what happened before this conversation? Like is she used to coming home to an empty fridge and now she has to shop randomly and unexpectedly? Where it's not about food but walking in the door to find you've eaten all of the x... She had planned to make y.... And now needs to change plans or shop?\n\nIs this about money or is this about effort?", "How does she feel about the way things are set up?

You're acting as if 3 years age difference means she is incapable of being an equal partner to you... you talk bout her like you're 49 be she's 26 not like you're 29 and she's 26. \n\nAnd none of what you said at all indicates you do think she contributed to your life in any way... Just that you think she can't understand how to care for herself or you, doesn't understand, and that she pays her portion and kicks up a fuss because she's never had a savings plan, doesn't understand bills, and doesn't know how to clean up after herself. \n\nThat's what I mean by it doesn't even sound like you view her as an equal. You seem think she'd incapable. And that saying \"yo, wipe down the counter after you make yourself lunch\" is somehow inflicting suffering on someone?\n\nAnd if you view your partner as incapable and not willing to step up than that is one heck of a relationship you signed up for.", "You probably should if you're too dense to understand that some children go hungry in this world.", "She is telling you that there is a problem.

In the comment I made to the op I said it could be a sign of something else going on or making her feel the dynamic is unfair.", "Okay so you said 80/20 but if she\u2019s what you assume to be $750 and you\u2019re $1500 then that\u2019s already 66/33 BUT if she\u2019s actually spending a normal amount of money on groceries she\u2019s likely spending $1250 and you\u2019re spending $1500 which would be 55/45 so you\u2019re basically splitting 50/50 like all the other couples. YTA", "How much more do you make than her? If you make 2x as much that\u2019s an equitable split.", "WOAH!! Full stop!! Groceries is NOT $250/month!! AT LEAST double that if not 3x!!", "Dude, she's on a trip & will not be eating her proportion.  Is this really worth dying on the hill for?? Tell her she has to buy you a pizza when she gets home. Whatever! This is an opportunity to make this a fun disagreement you can laugh about for years! Have fun with it!!", "I think NTA. But if she\u2019s really throwing a fit over it maybe she can start spitting or taking over other bills and you guys can split groceries", "So the rent is more like a 70/30 split? Are all bills split this way? Do both of you contribute to house hold chores equally? Have you considered splitting bills to reflect the same ratio as the disparity in your income or is that what the current split reflects? \n\nYou do mention you\u2019re not married but don\u2019t mention how long you\u2019ve been together. If you\u2019re living together and serious enough about each other than she can feel slighted that financials are still split apart. It\u2019s hard to tell what this is really about it without having more insight into your relationship dynamic.\n\nI could also be giving your gf too much credit and she\u2019s just being unreasonable. If that\u2019s the case I think you would have caught onto that before moving in so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking these questions and trying to find a cause. Hope my line of thinking helps you! Good luck.", "So if you go away for a week, does that mean you don't have to pay rent for that week and since she would be the only one there?", "Thank you very much. I thought so too. Every non married couple in our circle does the 50/50 split regardless of wage differences. Luckily for most has been manageable, but for one where the difference was as significant as ours the lower earning individual was in a constant state of struggle.", "She just asked what was frozen because she didn't want it to go bad while she was away. I was confused because I wouldn't let food go bad and I figured it would be assumed that I would eat it. I'm not going to be here scarfing down everything in the kitchen and expect her to refill it when she gets back. \n\nI do the shopping, cooking, and most of the cleaning.  It's in no way a reflection on her, as I'm the more cost effective shopper, I'm the better cook, and I'm the cleaner person. All things she has said to me herself which is why I do all of it. I'm okay with all of it because I like to save us money, I like to cook, and I like our place clean. Effort or money? Idk you tell me.", "Well when our relationship started getting more serious we started discussing the hypotheticals and I always lead with paying based off of our earnings. So of course I make more I pay more. She's always been fine with it. When we got closer to actually moving in we laid everything out regarding who would pay what. I pay the majority of the $1500 to her $200 not including her $100 fee for 4 pets and she pays for the utilities, internet, and groceries. She agreed to that too. Do you have tourettes that causes you to involuntarily type out full insults? Because that came out of nowhere.  That's crazy though dude good for you.", "I don't think age is an issue at all. It's just how she was raised and there's a learning curve and compromises along the way. She has savings even more than I do because she lived with her mom and didn't blow it all. \n\nThere's more to contribute than just cooking for me and cleaning for me. Just because I can pay my own bills and keep on living life doesn't mean she won't take something from my life should she live. I've not once implied that I was resentful for what I do. I just wanted to clarify whether or not im the asshole for thinking that her request was a weird one. Which we have throughly seen in this thread which way the poll sways.", "Que the fake outrage of a typical redditor. Nothing in the post indicates any of this. Get off the internet, you armchair psychologist.", "I don't want an equal split. An equal split would mean she would struggle. I just think that she already has a good situation and to ask me not to eat when I pay more so that she doesn't have to worry yet I now I have buy my own food is ridiculous.", "Idk where you live, but a single couple with no kids is not spending  $1250 on groceries a month. Her $750 in total bills is INCLUDING groceries estimated at between $200-250 a month.", "I do make just under if not twice as much. Does that mean I should be paying even more? Genuine question.", "We literally spend $250-$300 a month on groceries. I would know, I do the shopping.  Idk what to tell you bud, but neither of us are starved or leave the table without full bellies. I'd hate to live wherever you live that costs 2 single adults $750+ in groceries.", "Rent is closer to a 70/30 split. I did mention to another user that she pays an extra $100 in pet fees( so rent is really $1700+$100 in pet fees) because she has 4 dogs to my 1. But I also don't think that an extra $35 on my part would lessen her financial worries if that was the issue. \n\nI do most all of the cleaning and tidying as I am the cleaner spouse. I do 95% of the cooking, but I will say that's on me because I'm the better cook and clean as I go and like doing it. In turn I also do the shopping as I am more cost effective and have a better idea of ingredients and food use for the month. Not patronizing her, but I handle most all of the adult stuff, just because I'm better at it and this is the first time out of her parents. I don't mind doing this. \n\nWe have been together almost 4 years, but 5 months in I got my own place without her because 1.) It was too soon in our relationship for either of us to move in and 2.) She has 4 dogs and at the time no rental allowed that many dogs. A rental was our only choice as the market out here was insane post covid.", "No, that would mean she'd need to find a new place to stay..... lol", "I'm sorry I'm so confused right now..... \n\nYou talk about this lady like she's absolutely good at nothing.  Shopping? You're better. Cleaning? You're better? Paying bills? You pay more. Making money, you make more? You say she's never been away from home she grew up with an upper middle class family... I'm just confused about what is happening here. These are all things that ya all could do together which she would then get better at... which is generally how people get better at things... By doing them and learning from the people around them?\n\nI kind of wonder if she's acting like a child cause you treating her like one? Or if she's behaving this way because something else is going on? I think you're setting yourself up here... Because if every task in a couple.is who is better and you're always the person better at everything than why are you even in a relationship with her? To take care of her and do everything for her? If that's your jam than I'm not shocked she expects you to do everything for her, even ridiculous things. \n\nI agree her comment is out of pocket given all that info. So much so that either she fell and bumped her head... Or she's like trying to tell you that first thing when she gets back she can't afford a grocery trip. Like I might just ask her why she would say that? Cause it's confusing.", "We're all thinking it. You talk about your girl like she's half your age.", "Yup and my vote is you're NTA. \n\nI'm suggesting that the way you're describing the situation is a recipe for resentment. Especially when you have no direct response to \"what does she contribute to your life\"... And the only response is \"she's lived at home and makes less and is messier\". \n\nLike over time that is going to wear thin. Really thin.", "I replied to you in another thread. I thinks it\u2019s ridiculous as well but also it might indicate that something else is going on and bothering her.", "No I\u2019m saying her total for bills would be $1250. I have never spent under $750/m on groceries but maybe this is because I eat 99% of my meals from home. Do you both maybe eat out more often?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m raising the $250 for groceries to $750 making the total payments for her month $1250", "That\u2019s insane. You\u2019re saying breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, alcohol for 2 people for a whole month is $300 or less? That means each meal you make is $1.60? That\u2019s just not possible unless you live off of ramen and air.", "Dang, not very much to go on from that. The only other thing I would say is that maybe she didn\u2019t realize how ridiculous it sounds as she said it but that\u2019s about it. \n\nGood luck man! If you want to make it work then let this go until she returns. Address this issue but try to show how it looks from your side. Don\u2019t involve the other finances until she brings them up first. Because this is ridiculous just by itself, you don\u2019t even need to bring up the other details to prove this. If that doesn\u2019t work then it seems you would have clear evidence of your incompatibility.", "I mean, he might not feel comfortable with her taking up 100% of the apartment space all by herself. /S\n\nSo ridiculous, food has a shelf life and especially refrigerated foods like veggies won't make a week. Besides, the food was paid for to be eaten during that period. \n\nIf the relationship is deteriorated to playing pissing games over who buys what it might be time to start making other arrangements. \n\nNTA", "She said that growing up her mom never cooked for her. She can cook, but I grew up poor and couldn't afford to just eat out everyday. So I have a lot more experience and recipes under my belt. Like I said I also just like the process of cooking. Shes fine with that, shes love my cooking and so do I lol These are the same reasons I'm the better shopper and more cost effective one.\n\nI pay more because I make more. I don't want her to struggle and I want her to have fun money and savings money so I'm fine with that. I'm not better than her because I make more. \n\nAnd the last point is that I'm just the cleaner spouse. I'm not saying equally clean people aren't out there, I'm just saying I'm the cleaner one of the two lol. \n\nWe do all these things together. Shes with me shopping, shes with me cooking if I need her to be in that moment, and she's with me cleaning I'm just more likely to start it.", "I'm 29 she's 26. Just raised differently I guess.", "Yeah, another user suggested that maybe she should swap groceries for a more consistent bill so she doesn't have to worry about whether or not she has to pay more from one month to another.  I'm hoping it's that because I'd be fine with swapping things around.", "No we don't really eat out too often, home cooked meals hit better than fast food. Where do you live and are you eating 3 full courses a day? What kind of meals are you having on the daily. How many mouths are you feeding? So many factors.", "So her idea was that any extra junk food/treats would be treated as individual expenses. I'm okay with that because I don't eat a lot of junk food or drink a coffee everyday. We also don't drink alcohol very often. I have a bottle of whisky on the fridge from 3 months ago. We work different hours so we don't often eat breakfast. She takes lunch to work which is usually just a sandwhich with a side of chips and some grape, or what-have-you that's part of our combined groceries. And for dinner it's pretty basic stuff whether it be pastas, casseroles, or just your portions of meat, veggies, and carbs. Lots of rice because I'm Asian so there's that too. I'm not a morning eating and usually work through my lunch.", "Appreciate it!", "Okay so she is cooking, cleaning, and shopping. Why in the heck would you say that you are the person who handles all of that if you literally do it together?", "Do you think that in her head she believes that if you eat while she\u2019s gone she will literally have no food upon her return? I was thinking there\u2019s no way she would believe something so ridiculous but then again this all started from something ridiculous.", "Because I am the one doing the cooking. I am the one usually doing the cleaning because she's messy. So I do a majority of it, but because I like to just get it done if I see it. She's there with me shopping, but we don't make a list because since I do the cooking I know what to buy. Our grocery bill is pretty much always around the same. I buy bulk meats and veggies every 2 weeks. Anything extra is her snacks that she buys separately which is her junk food and coffee. This was her idea. I don't drink coffee every day or buy sweets so it's fine with me.", "I should also add that none of this was decided on without her agreement and consent. She prefers I shop because she even says I'm better about it. Same with cooking. I'm cool with her doing paying and letting me turn money into a lasting supply of food.", "Wow none of that without your consent either... Woof... You just setting yourself right up."]}
