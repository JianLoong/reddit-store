If it's such a concern for them, they can also offer their own bedroom to your brother and the GF, but you get to chose what to do with your room.", "NTA  You are paying rent for that room so it is unreasonable for your parents to ask you to let others use it.  You have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. If you're paying for the room; it's yours. Why are you supposed to vacate what you're paying for for people not paying? Sounds like blatant favoritism.", "You pay rent. It's no longer a guest room bc they're accepting payment for you to stay there.\n\nI get that it would make more sense for two people to share the bed, but they've rented the room out to you so they don't have a guest room anymore. \n\nI personally would probably do it since it's just one night if it didn't put me out, just to avoid problems. I would *not* stay in a sleeping bag on the floor, though. \n\nEither way, NTA", "NTA. \nYou pay rent for your room, she cannot just kick you out when she feels like it.\n\nIt\u2019s ok that she asked but she needs to accept your no.\n\nNow if she wants to give \u00a310-\u00a320 per night off your rent then that could be something to consider if you don\u2019t mind - just to help your brother out mainly. But again, you\u2019ve no obligation.", "NTA. If you're paying rent for the room, it's yours. Brother and his girlfriend can use the lounge. An air mattress sounds sensible.", "NTA - technically they are now your landlord - with all the obligations that entails.", "If parents are so concerned they can give their own bed up. NTA.", "NTA. You are renting that room so you have a say in who stays in it. Your alternate suggestion was reasonable. If they do make you vacate the room, you should reduce what you pay them for the weekend you didn't have access to it.", "NTA \n\nYou are paying rent and therefore a tenant. \n\nYour brother and GF can sleep in living room or at 10 pm thar night, move tge bed to the living room and they can sleep on bare floor.", "INFO: What's actually fair market value for a room in your area?\n\nIf you're getting a big break, then they're doing you a favor. You could return it.\n\nThat said, it is *your* room, and there's no reason the brother can't sleep in the lounge.\n\nHell, you could even offer to buy the air mattress yourself if it will smooth things over.", "Here a question: Who are you: their son or their tenant? Also, what would you prefer, they treat you as their son or their tenant? The last question: are you ready to face the consequences if things escalate? This is not a AH or NTA incident. This could be the moment that will determine all your future. Be careful. Sometimes being right has no meaning. In my opinion asking your brother and his girlfriend sleeping in a place where everyone can see them is an AH move.
