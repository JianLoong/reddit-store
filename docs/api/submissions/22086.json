I was previously living in Arizona with my Dad and his family since the age of 10. \n\nAbout 3 months ago I was still living in AZ. Living there was like actually hell. Since I had been living with them full time they treated me like crap. Pretty much everyday I was being insulted for the way I looked or the way I dressed. I was also judged for the things I ate, how I talked ect.. \n\nNow you could say my dad is \"Emotionally stunted\" and so is his wife. So trying to express my emotions and how I felt was hard. When I tried to say things I liked it was always, \"shut up\" or \"Do you ever stop talking??\" \n\nSo for the last 5 years neither of them have given two shits Abt me. They even took away my ability to contact my mom. And everything was extremely hard for me. And abt 4 months ago my dad told me he was kicking me out and sending me to Alabama to live with my mom and I had 2 weeks to pack and leave. \n\nThis whole situation was extremely hard for me as I had to pack my entire life in 2 suitcases and 5 boxes. With all that stress neither my Dad or his Wife made things any easier for me. They pretty much ignored me and pretend I didn't live there, however throwing out insults from time to time. \n\nEventually the day came and I dragged my suitcases downstairs where they proceeded to go through them and take anything they thought \"wasn't necessary\" they took a lot of my things out and even let my younger brother jump on one of the suitcases (breaking one of the items inside).\n\nThis was already enough for me to cut them off but now I never want to see them EVER again. When I arrived in Alabama I only had 4 days before I became very ill. For about a week I was unable to eat, drink and I couldn't walk. After the 8th day at home I was taken to the hospital where I stayed for the next two weeks fighting for my life.. \n\nAnd you know what my dad did? Absolutely nothing. Not a single message to me, not a video. Literally nothing, but unlike him his wife had shit to say. She was saying that I probably took a bag of pills to try to k!// myself. \n\nNow that was the last straw. After I got released from the hospital I cut them both off and refused to even try and contact them. My dad wants me to visit during winter break and I said no way. He's been calling my mom saying it's not fair for me to treat them that way.
