If the bio mom refuses to release the kids to you, record her saying this and take her to court.\n\nAlso, this wasn't petty. You offered a shopping spree to replace stolen goods. Lauren wasn't missing any clothes so didn't need to go shopping,  also she is not your stepdaughter! Why would you spend money on her at all, even without considering she just bullied your daughter.", "NTA. Excuse me?? Your husband is saying YOU are petty for not taking his ex's step-daughter to the mall after she stole her stuff? Um, no. She stole clothes and refused to give them back. Then their actual mom stood up for the thief. Huge AH. They only gave some things back so she could try to go to the mall with you. Is that a joke? I wouldn't have taken her either way.\n\nAlso, don't bring any of their nice things to their mother's anymore. Is there a way you can give her a luggage lock for when she does stay there?", "NTA\u2026I would have told Lauren \u201csorry, I don\u2019t take little girls who steal to malls.\u201d", "Bravo, you're brilliant. NTA, OP, and just the perfect amount of petty.", "NTA that girl is a thief. Why reward a thief?", "NTA, you are being a good Step Mom.   Bio mom is angry she has to deal with the aftermath of Laurens tantrum, when she created the monster.  She is not your responsibility to take shopping or buy anything for, especially when she is stealing from your girls.", "NTA. Lauren's not your daughter. For that reason alone, you are not obligated to spend a dime on her. The fact that she bullied your de facto daughter (you may technically be stepmom, but clearly you're more of a parent to these girls than biomom is) is irrelevant, even if it may feel good to stick it to her.", "NTA. Biomom had to know that Addison would defend Madeline, and she had to know Lauren was lying when she gave back some of M's things. You're being a good stepmom, and I'm giving your husband side-eye for being supportive of the behavior of his biochild's bully; he should be grateful you're standing up for these girls.", "Sounds like the kid get's her bullying and entitlement from her dear mommy. The guy/dad in this scenario is too bored by now of her bullshit and just wants to play nice. \n\nIt's a shitty game, but you need to play it better. Madeline needs to learn how to stand up for herself eventually, but in the meanwhile, you need to fight her battles for her. Nothing is worse for a shy kid than a bully who has everyone on their side.", "NTA - this is a perfect example of natural consequences. Or as the young and hip like to say.. she f*d around and found out \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ten years old is plenty old enough to have behaviour corrected. Heck, that would have been an appropriate consequence for a child half that age. \n\nStand your ground and get it in writing or recorded somehow via video that she\u2019s not releasing the children to you, and get a judge involved. Then the mom can get a taste of natural consequence too. Sounds like they both need to be put back in their own lane.", "totally NTA. you were refusing to reward lauren's bully behavior, which is how any parent should react.", "NTA. Lauren isn't entitled to your money and she certainly had no right to invite herself on a shopping trip. The fact that she gave more stuff back so you would buy her stuff is just disgusting. Bio mom is letting this kid down.", "NTA - this is about teaching consequences. Lauren can\u2019t steal clothes/toys and there not be consequences. It most certainly be used as a learning experience.\n\nVid a vis the bio mom, I don\u2019t know what the consequences will be if you go to court to enforce the court order, but that\u2019s well within your right.", "NTA and the little girl needs to learn to not steal and lie.", "NTA. You have no obligation to take your husband\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s stepdaughter anywhere for any reason. It\u2019s honestly weird that anyone would ask you to.", "NTA but I would be careful not to let the girls take anything they really like over there bc it could get ugly with the half sister taking stuff from them and bio mom will  probably be OK with it or even encourage it.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t being irrationally petty, you\u2019re being a mother protecting your two children. Did he expect you to reward Lauren acting like a bully? What message does that send your youngest daughter? She might be Madeline\u2019s bio-mom but this child picks on her youngest sibling and their mother is okay with that? She draws the line at pettiness but not bullying and theft? I think the only one petty here is her bio-mom, not you. \n\nI will say, however, that this is not a hill to die on. That being said\u2026I\u2019d personally make life easier on me and my husband and our kids by doing whatever needs to be done to satiate bio-mom, knowing very well you\u2019re not in the wrong.", "NTA.  Someone needs to teach both step and bio mom that stealing is not tolerated.  When you send the girls over, make sure it is in cheap clothes and tell them not to bring anything they do not want to lose.  Let bio mom and the step learn their lesson the hard way.", "NTA and your husband should threaten to take his ex back to court over custody if Lauren doesn\u2019t return everything she stole and stop taking things that aren\u2019t hers.", "I think it's a little weird that you refer to their mom, who is very much in their lives, as their \"bio mom,\" but other than that, NTA.\n\nLauren took the clothes and toys and refused to give them back. You told Madeline you would take her to the mall and replace them. You refused Lauren's request to reward her for her bad behavior. Your husband is calling you \"petty\" because you sticking up for Maddie has caused him some inconvenience.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA, but I do think it would\u2019ve been best to not tell your daughters about the shopping spree in front of Lauren. I\u2019d agree with your husband there about it being petty. Since the relationship with their bio mom is already complex you had to have known that this would cause undue tension.", "NTA, but it was a bit petty to say it in front of the other kid. But you were 100% in the right.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH. Lauren is young enough that you can\u2019t necessarily blame for acting irrationally. You\u2019re doing your best to enforce consequences for her behavior. \n\nThat said I think there\u2019s something you\u2019re not considering. Going to the mall isn\u2019t just about buying stuff for the kids. It\u2019s about the experience of participating in something together and get out of the house. Do you really want to further isolate Lauren and potentially create resentment of your own two kids? \n\nWhy not say \u201cyou can come but you\u2019re getting much less stuff because you stole these items\u201d?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From how this arrangement is set up, it sounds as you and your husband are providing a much more stable home life, I am actually surprised the judge allows the visitation to proceed since it sounds as though there is not enough room for all the children.  But the fact that this moving towards pickups and transfers of custody, this enters a realm I think the Bio mom does not want to enter.  \n\n\nAlso I want to mention, the little one stealing might be showing signs of neglect, thats why I don't agree how you handled the situation in front of the little one", "NTA.

Were you supposed to reward the little brat and her enabling mother??", "I totally understand feeling bad for the other little girl, she probably doesn't get those kind of opportunities a lot however NTA. If anything its the bio mom for letting her daughter bully the other girls and take from them without consequences.  Children are a product of their environment, while Lauren was absolutely in the wrong I do understand why your husband would feel a certain way. Its not being petty its teaching consequences that seem very much needed. Lauren probably feels left out and maybe even jealous of the other girls but they're still young enough to bond and have a good relationship. If things work out with bio mom and she isn't too upset then it would be a great opportunity to take all three girls out to do something fun together and you would have a chance to explain to Lauren that you were not being mean or excluding her but rather it was a consequence for her actions.", "NTA at all, you\u2019re a great step mym", "NTA\n\nYou might have been petty but the way I see you, you taught Lauren consequences, something that it doesn't sound like bio mom (and maybe even dad) cares to do. \n\nYour husband should be advocating for his own daughter.  He needs to be up in arms about the fact that his daughters' bio-mom allows them to be robbed.", "NTA, this bio mom is insane. Why is she allowing her stepdaughter to bully and steal from her own daughter? Even if her stepdaughter were kind and considerate, why on earth would there be any expectation you would take her shopping with your own stepkids?

It\u2019s about the experience of participating in something together and get out of the house.\n\nExactly why it's a apt thing to forbid the stealer from attending, the 10 y/o knows that it's all that, and she also knows that you don't steal in life.\n\n> Do you really want to further isolate Lauren and potentially create resentment of your own two kids? \n\nThe 10 y/o already bullies the 9y/o and steals from them, have you even read the post?\n\n> Why not say \u201cyou can come but you\u2019re getting much less stuff because you stole these items\u201d?\n\nBecause that would be rewarding the stealer.\n\n\"The last time I stole, they took me to the mall and bought me things, remind me again why I shouldn't steal?\"", "The ex isn't even Lauren's mom - just her stepmom.

In what world does any of this make sense? She lets someone steal from her own child then defends the thief then tries to push her exes current wife to buy things for the thief.\n\nNTA and I hope their dad is keeping track of how the mother is treating Madeline.

She's not throwing her wealth in a child's face.

Actions, meet consequences.", "Don't give me that, it's very obvious she intentionally brought it up in front of the kid to let her know that she won't be getting any nice things while her kids will be.
