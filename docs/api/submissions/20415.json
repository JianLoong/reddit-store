We love each other but growing up we always made fun of each other. To me what just happened was so in line without we\u2019ve always been but she says I stepped over a line today.\n\nMy sister had a birthday part today for my nephew (7) at a trampoline park. My sister thought it would be fun to take a running leap into the pit filled with foam blocks\u2014apparently not realizing that she did not have the strength to dig herself out and climb up the rope ladder. She panicked and with every scream she sunk deeper into the pit. Her boyfriend went and found a worker and by that time you couldn\u2019t even see her anymore but just hear \u201cI\u2019m going to d!e, I\u2019m going to d!e\u201d from under the foam. The workers essentially had to shut down the entire park and actually got out a snow shovel to dig the foam out around her.  Six guys were all in there.\n\nWhen they finally got her over the edge of the pit she had little scraps of green and purple foam all in her hair, her voice was horse from screaming and she collapsed as these guys were trying to walk her down to the lobby. Something about the ridiculousness of the situation made me laugh so hard. Well that made her find her strength because she got up and got in my face and started screaming \u201cyou\u2019re a b!tch, you\u2019re a ticking asshole, fuck you, you can never see my kids again.\u201d\n\nI asked my cousin and she agreed that while it was funny, it\u2019s a story that\u2019s funny at thanksgiving dinner and not in the moment.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687549802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h7w5k/aita_for_laughing_at_my_sister_after_she_got/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You for not waiting to burst out laughing (although I'm sure it was hilarious) and her for threatening to never let you see the children again. It disgusts me that so many people easily use their children as pawns in these stupid little arguments. \n\nGreat storytelling. \ud83d\ude02 I can see her in the pit.", "I am dying here hahahahahahahahaa", "YTA\nThere's not a chance in hell that I could witness something like that and not die laughing so I'm the AH too. Kinda makes me think she was being melodramatic too since she was collapsing, then suddenly very mobile after she sees you laughing.", "I think I saw a video on TikTok, not sure it\u2019s the same. Anyways we\u2019re all AHs because I would have died laughing!", "Are you the asshole? Yes...yes you are. Is this story hilarious? Yes...Yes it is.", "YTA for laughing because she was emotionally distraught. \n\nThat said I can definitely see where it might be funny and sometimes you can't control laughter.\n\nYour cousin is spot on. \n\nTry see it from her side and apologize?", "YTA\n\nIt probably very well be funny to reminisce about in future years, but very insensitive in the moment. It seemed like a genuinely traumatizing moment for your sister, and she needed comfort from you in that moment rather than being laughed at", "info: Why would they have a foam pit for children that an adult can't get out of?", "Nta, that sounds hilarious", "Just gotta say.... I would not be able to contain my self! That is funny as hell! I would be absolutely dying...\n\nI can also see your sis was embarrassed/traumatized. I mean if that were me I would be.\n\nThis is just so something that would happen to my sister and I.. One of us would undoubtedly be pissed and the other dying of laughter... \nWe always get over it. So hopefully your sister will calm down and you WILL have to apologize... NAH", "NTA I'm sure she was super embarrassed, but it was not a deadly situation.  I would have laughed at a stranger, and my my sibling would never live that down. They'd be getting foam blocks or ropes for every occasion.", "YTA, but it\u2019s possible I would have reacted the same way. Sometimes it\u2019s just funny\u2026 And 5 stars for your storytelling. I was right there seeing the whole thing.", "NAH. It certainly wasn\u2019t very nice, but I can see how the situation looked funny from the outside. \n\nGive her a bit of time to calm down, then go apologize.\n\nEDIT: changed my judgement from N-T-A.", "YTA. Make sure she\u2019s ok before laughing about it.", "INFO: Was her inability to get out due to an extreme lack of physical fitness or was it due to a malfunction of the foam pit?", "YTA. \n\nIt probably was very funny, and as a stranger I\u2019d probably laugh at it in the moment. As her sister, she probably didn\u2019t appreciate you laughing at her as it seems like she was genuinely afraid, and embarrassed. \n\nThis is definitely something you show support during, and then laugh at once things settle.", "That\u2019s hilarious, NTA", "NTA. Not going to lie, this sounds hilarious at the sheer ridiculousness. The first time we took our son to the trampolining park my partner jumped onto the air pillow and sunk right in - it\u2019s like he was consumed by the whole damn thing. I almost peed myself laughing as he was telling me he couldn\u2019t get out. Guess what though? He managed it when he calmed down, and then also saw the funny side too.", "YTA. She legit feared for her life. Bad timing on laughing.   It was important to make sure she was really okay.", "She's the asshole, collapsed but found the energy to bring violence \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.\nDrama queen.", "YTA\n\n\n\n\nShe thought she was going to die and reacted to that......\n\n\n\nYou......

Laughing can be an involuntary action. And really, that shit was funny. I just read it and I bust out laughing.", "She had a traumatic experience and her body reacted in panic.  It's impossible to control her reactions during that. It's almost like her body didn't care that it was happening in a foam pit and would be \"funny\" to unempatheic assholes.   You, however,  could have controlled your reaction. YTA\n\nEdit: you seem to feel the need to body shame your sister claiming in multiple comments that she got trapped because she's overweight.", "YTA, but it was funny. She got stuck in foam. Give her time to cool down, because it is possible that she was feeling a load of embarrassment that she couldn't pull herself out, made her situation worse by struggling, had a panic attack, and then six men had to help her out of there, and when she realized the entire park was shut down to help her out, she was likely collapsing under the humiliation. So, then she sees and/or hears you laughing hysterically at her and that was just the last straw.\n\nGive her time to cool off, then talk about it. She's probably going to expect an apology for laughing at her, and you probably should, just because you didn't wait to make sure she was okay, or not shut down emotionally from humiliation before laughing. This is one of those moments where laughing in the moment is insensitive.", "Lol.. nta..  I did the same thing, and I was laughing harder than any of the kids!!! Two very strong young men pulled me out, and suggested I not try it again. Guess what! I did it again, and they had to pull me out...AGAIN! It was freaking hilarious!", "NTA \ud83d\ude02 if you\u2019re not fit enough to get out of a foam pit don\u2019t jump in?

It was a natural response to a very comical situation. She was the one who threw herself into the foam pit, you didn't push her. So she's humiliated, that's why she's so angry. When she cools off and unblocks you, you can apologize for adding to her embarrassment by laughing.", "YTA. That sounds traumatizing. She'll probably remember this interaction everytime her claustrophoc ptsd kicks in, and would hate for that fate to befall her children. She shouldnt stick with the alienation when you guys talk this out, IF you handle it well and realize how badly you fucked up in the moment.", "Mel Brooks \u2014 'Tragedy is when I cut my finger.

Had she been laughing then it would have been ok for you to laugh but the fact that she wasn\u2019t should have been a clear signal not to. She screamed herself hoarse, she was obviously freaked out.", "YTA.", "NTA that is hilarious and I have no idea how that can possibly happen.", "NTS Too fat to get out. Some things are not meant for the obese. Shouldn't have tried to do it if she can't even lift her own weight.", "INFO seems like sister has some trauma ? what happened to her to feel that panic in the pit", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t laugh at someone when they\u2019re clearly distressed.

She probably expected you to be rushing over with concern and sympathy, not laughter. I might've laughed too but that depends if I could tell how scared she was. If she was looking terrified I would've held back on showing my amusement and took their fear seriously.\n\nEither way, you obviously care about them. Give them some time. I'm sure that they'll calm down about it eventually. After all, you are sisters.

But yes, funny, but funny as in, \"remember when we were at the trampoline path years ago...\" she was scared and stressed. These things need space. Maybe send her a card since she's blocked you apologizing for laughing at her when she was traumatized at that moment. She shouldn't be using her children as ammo.", "YTA. But apparently I would be too cos I laughed my ass off reading that lol. She was probably highly embarrassed i mean who wouldn\u2019t be. She likely blew up at you because of her embarrassment more than the fact you laughed. She\u2019ll probably calm down. Sometimes you just can\u2019t control the laughter when people trip or whatever.", "NTA that sounds hilarious tbh", "YTA\n\nEven if she wasnt in any danger, she genuinely feared for her life, panicked so badly and screamed so much her throat was hoarse, and then had to deal with the humiliation of having the park being shut down and her needing rescue.\n\nNever seeing the kids again is a bit much, but I wouldn't talk to you either.", "Gonna go out on a limb, NTA, how do you sink in a foam pit, its foam, the compression ratio doesnt make sense, I dont understand this to the point i cant explain it, could someone help me out?", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re laughing because to you it\u2019s just a foam pit.

Not recognizing that and not apologizing makes you the asshole. \n\nPeople can die from choking on a pea and people can drown in just a few inches of water.

From other people, maybe, but OP may have poisoned this particular well.", "Semi athletic adults are fine in foam pits. Children are extra fine because they basically float on top anyways.", "Pretty standard for a trampoline park and probably not designed for people of my sisters weight and level of fitness", "You realize that acronym says that her sister is an asshole? Do you think so?", "It's a foam ball pit.  Other than freaking herself out and being embarrassed, she was ok.  I highly doubt you can actually suffocate and die in a foam ball pit.", "she was in a foam pit tho so lieeeke", "Foam pit was pretty deep for sure but way more likely her being massively out of shape. I got out just fine when I did the rope ladder over the top of it.", "Malfunction of the foam pit? It's a foam pit. They all pretty much do the same thing; be full of foam squares.", "Its a foam ball pit, you can not possibly die from it, she was just overexaggerating it", "She never calls her overweight, she says 1) the foam pit is not designed for people of her weight (true as it\u2019s designed for children) and 2) she\u2019s too out of shape to climb the rope ladder. Those rope ladders are hard, you have to be pretty strong to pull yourself out of those pits", "She wasn't body shaming her sister. She said she didn't have the strength to use the rope ladder.", "It's a foam ball pit.  She wasn't actually going to die.  There was no emergency.", "I think a lot of her reaction might be attributed to her being embarrassed about the whole thing.  It\u2019s true that everyone has their \u201cmoments\u201d but it doesn\u2019t make it less humiliating when you have a moment of your own. \n\nDefinitely give her some time.

I understand now that [you were distressed and laughing at you was a jerk move. I should have offered support instead].", "Give it time.  Look for a chance. You'll find one.", "Probably worth messaging her partner and say that you\u2019re sorry, you understand why your sister is upset and that you\u2019d like to apologise when she\u2019s ready to speak to you. Leave the ball in her court but let her know you are sorry.", "You really hurt her feelings. Give it some time. Mail her an apology if you're still blocked in a week.", "Weight shouldn't matter.  It would be worse if little kids wiggled under the foam.  They're a lot shorter. All she had to do was stand up.", "Hm, good point. Hadn\u2019t thought about that.", "Yeah she\u2019s physically ok. Kinda sounds like she was on the verge of a panic attack and OP was laughing at her, that\u2019s a dick thing to do to your sister.", "I am probably going to get downvoted to hell, but I vote NTA.\n\nMake stupid choices win stupid prizes.\n\nIf you are so unathletic that you cannot lift your body weight, you should not jump into a foam fit, actions have repercussions.", "So some foam pits should have large heavier pieces at the bottom to provide a more stable base to allow people to climb out of it easier. Its also possibly for the supporting base to break and to have the foam drop down several feet, making it almost impossible for even an athletic person to get out.\n\nSource: Worked the foam pit at a church camp years  and years ago and we took all the pieces out each night to clean the pit and threw them back in each morning, starting with massive heavy pieces and than adding layers of small pieces. If done in the opposite order the heavy pieces would compress the smaller ones and make the entire thing smaller and more difficult to move around in", "and not just a foam ball pit but one that CHILDREN play in, talk about drama queen. I would have laughed at her too!", "I might\u2019ve missed something, but it definitely read to me like the sis had a panic attack in the foam pit.  If they\u2019re shutting the place down to rescue her, that\u2019s an emergency.", "Foam pits in trampoline parks are deeper because you often jump into them from high heights. This is very common in tramp gyms. She shouldn't have jumped in without thinking about whether she could get out.", "Ok thanks", "For sure. Maybe you meant NAH? Or maybe you do mean NTA im not judging.", "Interesting! I genuinely did not know that, thanks. I did a lot of trampoline growing up, so I have interacted with these pits a lot. But good to learn your perspective.", "No, you\u2019re right. If I don\u2019t blame OP for laughing, I can\u2019t really blame her sister for snapping."]}
