They are very close but she has always been pretty nice to me, which is why this story was a bit extra surprising. \nEver since I was a baby I have been allergic to coconuts, I break out into hives and my throat swells up\u2026 the whole bit. \n\nMy mil is a bit of an overly anxious person and that seemed to go into overdrive when I got pregnant. \nRight away she demanded I start taking prenatals.. which is understandable. Except she apparently talked to her doctor and demanded I use the brand he said was best, demanded that I start working from home to relieve stress, etc. just a bit over the top. It got to a head when she did more \u2018research\u2019 and concluded that her grandson cannot have formal and must be breastfed. After months of her sending me articles about how formula is poison I finally told her we will just breastfeed despite the fact that I wasn\u2019t really planning on it. \n\nCome the day I have my son and it is a traumatic birth. 50 hours in labor just for me to hemorrhage and having to get a C-section. My son had a few complications and had to be in the nicu. Between the stress of it all\u2026 my supply never really came in. By day 3 I was scared to not feed my child more than a couple ounces so I put him on formula to supplement the first few weeks. My mil was furious and the day we brought him home she had a breakdown because I was \u2018going to kill her baby\u2019 if I didn\u2019t breastfeed. \nAfter a few weeks we were trying anything to increase my supply and it was slowly going up. As I was still healing , my MIL went grocery shopping for us. She knows I am allergic to coconut as she has seen me have a reaction before and we have reminded her many times. \nWell that night she brought me my waterbottle that was filled with juice.  Except it wasn\u2019t juice, it was body armor. A coconut water energy drink. It didn\u2019t taste like coconut so I drank a lot of it. It I need to go to the hospital 3 weeks post op because my throat was closing. My husband was furious but assured me it was probably an accident. \nWell it wasn\u2019t. My mil asked me a few days later if I felt like it helped my supply at all. Apparently she did more \u2018research\u2019 and saw that some people claimed body armor increased their supply like crazy so she figured \u2018you have an epi pen it wouldn\u2019t kill you, plus if it helps the baby that\u2019s what matters\u2019.\n I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the hormones or if it is justified but I cussed her out and told her to leave my house. I told her that if she was willing to risk my life for her own delusions than she cannot be trusted with my baby. I don\u2019t want her to be at my house or around my child or me.

It isn\u2019t poison and if your child is healthy, well nourished and happy that is literally all that matters. I can\u2019t stand that mom shaming bull shit.", "NTA. Your husband is at best an enabling idiot at worst he really doesn\u2019t care that you could have died.  I am so sorry you are being pressured and harrassed. Many women find breastfeeding difficult for a range of reasons and your MIL needs to\nGet her facts from an actual dr not dr google", "NTA.\n\nThis woman is \\*dangerous\\* - she quite literally rationalises away nearly giving you a fatal allergic reaction as if it were nothing, and she admits to doing it on purpose.\n\nIf someone is capable of doing that to you and \\*still\\* thinks they're on the right track for doing it, there's something seriously seriously seriously not right. And if your husband won't accept that forcing someone to have an allergic reaction for a bit of breast milk (when, yes, formula is perfectly valid to use) is completely \\*bonkers\\*, then maybe he isn't worth the marriage, either.\n\nI am so, so sorry you had to deal with that at all, especially \\*right\\* after having your child.\n\nI do not blame you for wanting her as far away as you can get her.\n\nI also think her flipping out on you for not producing a load of breast milk is itself something that would warrant a serious damn discussion about whether or not you want her around when you have literally just had a child.\n\n  \nEDIT: I also don't buy that she wouldn't have known Body Armor is coconut. Because her \"doing her research\" means she would've come across that tidbit very very quickly.", "NTA! Your MIL sounds unhinged and the only doctor she should be talking to is a therapist. Does your husband not understand that his mother intentionally poisoned you? What if your baby develops allergies and she disregards them because she knows better? Repeated exposure to allergens is super dangerous and can make your reactions get worse!! You are right and you can not trust her with your baby. You need to sit your husband down and have a serious meeting. Your husband is being wildly underdramatic, this is a big deal!!", "NTA and I think this goes *far* beyond almost killing you, which is the weirdest thing I've typed so far today.   \n\n\nThere is some underlying issue here with her that urgently needs to be evaluated. I'm not even saying that unkindly -- she just doesn't appear to be emotionally stable or rational at the moment. I don't think she would intentionally hurt the baby, but ignorance is often just as deadly as negligence. Your husband needs to understand just how seriously she betrayed you with that coconut stunt. You *do not* do that to another human. It's literally a recipe for homicide.   \n\n\nYour husband needs to understand the gravity of the situation. Hopefully you get lots of good replies in this thread and can print them out to prove that to him.", "Woah what the fuck?? NTA at all. I personally would cut your MIL off entirely. She could have killed you and your husband is downplaying it too", "NTA and husbands reaction is a red flag", " NTA. Your husband is TA for not standing up for you after dealing with birth complications and having to deal with an overbearing MIL. If that problem isn\u2019t addressed while the kids are young it\u2019s certainly going to be harder when they get older because she\u2019s going to want more control. Talk to your husband, go to marriage counseling if necessary but please express how what she did literally could have been attempted murder had you not been able to get help.

You do not need the pressure of your MIL telling you what\u2019s best for your baby. YOUR Baby, not hers. \n\nPlus your husband needs to step up. If his mother is like this he\u2019s going to be scared of her, so it\u2019ll be hard for him. However he needs to understand that you and the baby are his family, and this woman is trying to affect both of your welfare.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL is a danger to you AND your baby.

I would file for a restraining order, and I would not let her anywhere near you or your child.  And I would seriously think about criminal charges  This woman is deranged - she deliberately gave you something that she KNEW almost certainly would have killed you.  My guess is that she's been nice to you so she could get a grandchild.  You were an incubator to her, now you're a walking milk supply.  She may decide that now you're just in the way of her bonding with baby.  And your husband is in an amazing level of denial, and he needs to sober up, FAST!  What his mother did could, and in some places would, be charged as a serious crime.  This was cold-blooded in the extreme. Please don't let them gaslight you into thinking this is somehow okay, or excusable, or an isolated incident.  Your life may depend on it (no exaggeration).", "Obviously NTA - she is a dangerous person and you should not allow a child anywhere near her. She needs therapy and time to work on herself. I hope you\u2019re feeling better.", "NTA. She could've killed you. Your husband needs to realize that. I know for my dad if his mother in law or his mother did something like that, he would kick them out of the house and not allow them to visit their grandchild until they have apologized to you and proven that they can be trusted to follow directions. Whether you want to breastfeed or not is your choice.", "NTA. File a police report and get a restraining order. She knows what she did. And if your husband won't back you up... it's marriage counseling or divorce. She tried to kill you!", "NTA. Your husband needs to set boundaries with her. That is *his* mother and *his* responsibility. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to decide how you raise your baby, she already raised hers.", "NTA she sounds unhinged.  And btw many women have issues breastfeeding.  Don't stress about formula.  In a perfect world every kid would be exclusively breastfed but be happy that formula exists unlike years ago.  If you want to and can breastfeed any amount and also feed formula that's perfect.  If you want to stop stressing over breastfeeding and feed just formula that's fine too.  Being stressed over it won't help and as a new mom you have enough stress as it is, especially with weird MIL in the background.\n\nI wouldn't let her near your kid.  God forbid he gets a peanut allergy and she thinks it's no big deal.", "NTA- see you soon on r/JUSTNOMIL .. You are not being over dramatic. This was intentional bodily harm and she should not be around you, your baby, or in your house. I would go NC and tell your husband if he has a problem with this and enables this type of blatant behavior then he can go with her.", "NTA But you MIL needs to stay the hell away from you.  Your husband needs to stand up to her. You're not overreacting.  Honestly, if you cut contact I don't think anyone would blame you.  She's more than crossed the line and you might even be able to have her criminally charged for what she did.", "She knowingly gave you something that could kill you and your husband thinks YOUR the dramatic one? You could have died and he just shrugs his shoulders? F that. Divorce. \n\nNTA", "NTA - It sounds like she has fallen into the rabbit hole of online mommy groups and thrown out all common sense. She needs to be banned from the house for a long time, and should probably seek mental help for whatever the heck is wrong in her head to do such a thing. Hubby can go see her at her house if he wants to socialize.", "NTA. NTA for your reaction. The main issue is that your husband is not on board so there is really no way to ban her from the baby. He disagrees and you are equal parents. At minimum tell him there needs to be a MIL time-out until you have recovered from your surgery. \n\nThat being said, I had no idea Body Armour is coconut water based and my teen at home is allergic to coconut so good information to have.", "NTA and she did it intentionally so could be charged with battery!!!", "NTA. Get that woman away from you and your child. All you need to know is she said \"I was going to kill her baby.\" Her baby! The woman is deranged and dangerous. If your husband is not onboard, leave and file a police report. She tried to kill you.", "You have a husband problem. If he thinks you're being dramatic after being intentionally poisoned by his mother, you're in for a very rocky time.", "NTA.  She tried to kill you to raise your baby. If your hubby can\u2019t see and understand that you have a big hubby issue", "NTA My question would be why did you let it get this far. You need to set clear boundaries and then follow them. Also communicate to her that you are uncomfortable when you are uncomfortable, she is obviously absolutely horrible at reading human body language, and possibly verbal language. Both my parents are horrible at communicating for different reasons. From what you wrote it looks like she might mean well. So then it sadly becomes on you and more your husband since it's his mom to start parenting her. We all have to parent our parents at some point, that's how you actually get rid of generational trauma. From personal experience, you're going to need to set those boundaries, tell her about them, and then continue telling her about them and following them, because she will break them without question for months if not years. Good luck. Also considering you have a newborn baby you don't need to do any of this right now but don't put it off for too long.", "NTA! What the actual f***! She purposely gave you coconut water! She could\u2019ve killed you! She can\u2019t be trusted and should be no where around you or your baby", "NTA. Tell him that either she goes, or you and the baby will and you might press charges. She knows you are allergic and still gave you the coconut water.", "NTA. What did she think the epinephrine in your system would do to the baby? I don\u2019t know if that crosses into breast milk but I guarantee she doesn\u2019t know either. \n\nAlso, ask her how all of us (meaning me) adopted babies survived off of formula! I\u2019m dying to know how we survived the poison. She needs to go", "NTA - sounds like you have more of a husband problem. Your MIL intentionally disregarded your life and your husband is defending her. If you can, you should move in with someone in your support system and let your husband think about his priorities...", "NTA you should file a police report", "NTA\n\nThis woman tried to kill you. I need you to realize this. You have an allergy that can be fatal, hence you have an epi pen. She knows you have a potentially fatal allergy, and she *deliberately gave you your allergen anyway*. She **tried to kill you**. An epi pen is not a magical shield against death from an allergen, it\u2019s a last ditch attempt to keep you from dying while you get to a hospital. You can still die from anaphylaxis if you use an epi pen *especially* if you don\u2019t get prompt medical care afterwards. This is akin to shooting someone in front of a hospital and claiming it\u2019s fine because the hospital has a good trauma center and they knew the doctors would be able to treat the bullet wounds just fine. She tried to kill you. You and *especially* your husband are SEVERELY underreacting to this. You need to report this to the police and she needs to never be within 200 feet of you or any of your food again.", "NTA. Your husband thinks that you\u2019re being overly dramatic because you don\u2019t trust her after she knowingly harmed you and seriously risked your life!? I get that your husband loves his mom, but no, you are not being overly dramatic and his lack of concern over this incident is alarming. He needs to think about how far this \u201cgrandma knows best\u201d issue can go and the problems it can cause. You both need to set strict boundaries with her, and she needs to know that after her stint she is not trusted and is on serious probation with you.", "Sorry OP. You also have a husband problem. Not just MIL problem. Please do talk to him regarding boundaries. So it\u2019s ok if the baby\u2019s mom dies? Your husband said you are \u201cdramatic\u201d. That\u2019s a low blow OP. I\u2019m so sorry this happened, but you did good. Keep up those boundaries. NTA", "Food tampering is a crime. Your MIL is a dangerous person who can\u2019t be trusted around you and certainly cannot be safely in contact with your helpless newborn. I can understand and how someone who was raised by a sneaky and manipulative mother would have a great deal of trouble coming to terms with the fact that his mom tried to kill his wife, but he needs to be brought around to your viewpoint here as quickly as possible. Ask him how he\u2019d feel about the situation if the person who poisoned you had been anyone but his mom. Ask how he might feel if your child ends up with a food allergy and his mom tries to sneak that allergen in your child\u2019s diet because she decides it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d for them. Ask him how he\u2019d react if it had been YOUR mother who poisoned you. That might help give him perspective. Then go together and file a police report and restraining order before she tries this again. \nThis is not a minor thing, but neither was her harassing you about how you feed your child. If he\u2019d put her firmly in her place when that talk started, this whole situation might have been avoided. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I was harassed by my mil about my inability to breastfeed, right up until we cut her out of our lives and never looked back. Going NC with her saved my marriage, and saved us years of unnecessary stress and heartache. Some people are just toxic. In your case your mil is both toxic and criminal. \nObviously, NTA", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t care if you were in ICU as long as HER baby got breast milk out of it. She is mentally unstable. I\u2019d be concerned there\u2019s some codependency going on between her and her son.", "NTA. I'd seek legal action. She endangered your life and by extension, your child's. At minimum, you should have a restraining order.", "Lady Farquaad here is a menace ( \"Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make,\"). She was clearly willing to risk your death, and probably would have been happier that way, as your spineless husband would have just let her raise your child as she wished. He needs to pull his head out of his ass, and she needs to be put in a very long timeout. And jail. Jail would be good. NTA", "I mean it sounds like she just thought body armor would help your supply and maybe didn\u2019t know it was a coconut drink.  But if she really did intentionally give you coconut, that seems criminal and if anything you under reacted.  Either way def NTA.", "I don\u2019t want to blame the victim here but op you need to realize that you helped create this monster and now you need to slay it. \n\nYou have been letting her walk all over you and now this habit is going to be hard to break. You need to put your foot down full stop. She is not allowed in your home for a LONG time and she will not speak a work about your parenting decisions. If she does you cut contact.

None of this. \n\nNTA", ">she cannot be trusted with my baby\n\nEh this may have been just a little over the top because she genuinely seems to care about her grandbaby, but it certainly was wrong of her to knowingly put you in danger. And like you like you said, it could possibly be the hormones making you react so strongly. I say NTA. You say you've had a pretty good relationship with her, please do what you can to maintain it, within reason of course. I'm not sure if she's really owed an apology from you (like that could have ended really badly, I'm glad it didn't!), but she most definitely owes you one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do what is best for you.", "NTA\nI am baffled that your husband is being so nonchalant about this. Your MIL purposely gave you something you were severely allergic to, admitted that it didn\u2019t matter since you had an epipen as long as you breastfed the baby. \nIf my husband backed his mom after she pulled this shit he would also be banned from the house.", "NTA!  I would have done the same thing.  She has boundary issues and is constantly overstepping.", "NTA\n\nDoes your husband not understand you could have fucking died?", "NTA. You could file charges for this.", "NTA and if your husband really thinks her attempt on your life isn\u2019t a big deal and you\u2019re over reacting then I would be getting myself far the hell away from him too until he takes her assault at best, attempted murder at worst, seriously. Please also report this to the cops. At minimum you need a restraining order. She doesn\u2019t see you as a person or a mother, she sees you as a facilitator or her grandchild and she\u2019s dangerous.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s kind of like attempted murder. That woman is crazy. Call the cops next time.\n\nAlso, nothing wrong with formula. Not everyone has a great milk supply. Formula was created to be used.", "NTA but you have a husband problem too. he needs to figure out if he\u2019s going to be an enabler to his mom or completely be on your side. no in between, he seems absolutely horrible for allowing this to keep going on.", "NTA You're underreacting. She basically almost murdered you. Just the fact that you were hospitalized is bad enough and your husband is awful calling this drama\n\nIf someone INTENTIONALLY almost kills you definitely need to stay away!\n\nThere's actually a really messed up story somewhere on reddit where a MIL killed her grandchild with coconut", "Overdramatic? Really? Not only did your mother in law push things on you BUT she straight up KNOWINGLY gave you coconut all because she did \"research.\" You could of died! And all she cared about was your baby getting boobie milk. If i were you id disown her and go no contact. \n\nAs for your husband... He is the one whose letting his mother get away with almost killing you! I call that being ab accomplice and for him to ignore your wants and to side with his mother... Id divorce him.\n\nMy verdict: NTA but your MIL and husband are TA.", "NTA, dude what the actual fuck?! That\u2019s a no contact. This woman hurt you with little to no regard and in a potentially fatal way that does not even make sense. I wouldn\u2019t let her in your house, I would not let her babysit. You can put your foot down here.", "NTA", "NTA.  You have valid reasons to keep that woman away from you and your baby before she poisoned you!  I hope your husband will see her for the crazy she is and support you!", "NTA. If this was my MIL she would simply not be in my life or my child\u2019s and my husband could choose which life he\u2019d want to be apart of because there is NO fucking way this women is safe for yourself or child to be around and if your husband can also rationalize what she did then maybe he is not safe to be around either. I\u2019d contact the police. Get some type of record over text saying she did it on purpose. She literally admitted to intentionally doing this which is very scary.", "NTA file a police report, you need to have this documented. You also have a serious DH problem. You could\u2019ve died!! Not sure where your marriage goes from here.", "This woman is desperate to re-do motherhood. Sounds toxic \n\nNTA!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA what\u2019s wrong with ur husband tho", "NTA.  She is never going to respect or adhere to any decisions you make about your kid that she doesn't come up with herself and you're right, she cannot be trusted with your kid.", "I don\u2019t want to think the worst of this obviously crazy situation. You had mentioned your husband didn\u2019t have his dad in the picture, so your MIL raised your husband up on her own. Do you think she may have deliberately gave you coconut water knowing you would have a serious allergic reaction to it? To have this baby to herself? Like some Hand that Rocks the Cradle type shit? I hate to bring that up, but you\u2019d be surprised what people can be capable of in situations like this. I\u2019ve had three boys all formula fed, all fine. I agree that breast feeding helps, a great deal, but there are situations out of our control that we just can\u2019t do that. I tried breast feeding with my first one, milk wasn\u2019t coming in right, so I just said the hell with it.\n\nShe admitted she did it because she read some bogus article that said that this particular water brand helps with breast milk, what???? It\u2019s not some miracle elixir that cures all breast milk issues. What bothers me the most is she admitted to it and your husband said you are overreacting. I don\u2019t think so. I sure hope you watch this nut job (I\u2019m being very nice here.) around your baby, she\u2019s lost the trust of having this baby on her own. This is very alarming, OP. I\u2019m not sure what I would do in your shoes, but keep her close, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you one bit if you pressed charges for assault, I\u2019m not sure if it would be a she said/she said situation. That would cause drama with your husband but your sanity, safety for you and your baby have been compromised and it\u2019s not about you anymore. It\u2019s about this lil duffer as well. Whatever you do, be careful and take care of yourself, OP. Your beautiful baby needs you. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe endangered your life. Plus, what was her breast milk back up plan if you had died? What helps the baby is having an alive mother.", "NTA, 1st thing you need to do is block your MIL. Then she is not allowed to visit till you are all healed and better. Could be months. Tell husband she can't be trusted around the baby especially alone as she might try something harmful that she read on the Internet. That alone is punishment. Have a question, don't they sell body armor that isn't coconut in it or did only the coconut one have the super power to make bread milk?", "NTA and honey please get a goddamn restraining order against your MIL asap and your man needs to cut the umbilical cord and get his head out of her ass. He's way too nonchalant about this, you are not overreacting AT ALL. \n\nPlease please please take care. We're rooting for you mamas.", "NTA.\n\nThis is willful poisoning. Can you file assault charges on her?", "An EpiPen isn't always enough, jfc that woman is unhinged. She gave you poison on the off chance it would increase your lactation. Your husband should care more that you almost died! Twice! Once giving birth and once premeditated murder by his mother! NTA", "NTA don't allow her to be around you OR the baby, EVER. ETA, I am concerned that your husband isn't more concerned. She could have killed you.  There is not a way for you to be over dramatic about that. You are the right amount of \"dramatic\". Also, fed is best. Don't let her get into your head about the breast feeding. Drawn hard boundaries NOW. Your child is not HER baby.", "Ask your husband if he wants to raise the baby with his mum instead, because I would've cussed her out myself if I was him \ud83d\ude44. Definitely NTA and keep her away.\n\nThis story reminds me of a post I saw that's so sad - about a woman's mother who intentionally used coconut product on twin babies despite knowing that they were allergic to it. One baby died as a result. She didn't believe in allergies or some shit like that. The whole family cut her off but it was too late. A poor wee girl died because the grandmother was trying to prove a point.", "It doesn\u2019t help the baby if you\u2019re dead.

She literally could have killed you. And she knows you are allergic to coconut! Go NC. Talk to police. Do not allow her near your kid. And you need to figure out whether your husband understands the gravity of the situation. Good luck x", "NTA. She literally said she doesn\u2019t give a rats ass what happens to you as long as \u201cher\u201d baby is ok. File a police report and talk to a lawyer. Get a restraining order, this woman tried to kill you.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t being anywhere near overdramatic. Epipens are for accidental emergencies, not intentional poisonings. They\u2019re expensive as hell, and they don\u2019t guarantee survival, especially when the allergen amount is high. \n\nYour husband isn\u2019t taking this seriously enough, and you MIL most certainly cannot be trusted around you or your child. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t reported her for essentially poisoning you on purpose. She should cover any medical bills arising from this and replace your epipen. She certainly shouldn\u2019t be allowed to prepare anything for you or the child again. I also wouldn\u2019t let her into the house in case she tampers with your food.", "Ask your hubs if he thinks I\u2019m sorry will bring your baby back to life? She has already proven she can\u2019t be trusted and it almost cost you your life.", "Jumping on to say this whole series of crazy events could be severely damaging to your mental health and cause ppd if you don't already have it. You need to be in a safe space and honestly away from your husband if he's that delusional and \"a dim crayon\" (that's me trying to be nice).

I'm not going to look for it but it was bad.", "OP, please please have your husband read this thread. \n\nYour husband is not doing nearly enough to defend his family, meaning you and the baby. He is likely enmeshed with his single parent mom but he needs to wake the fuck up. \n\nYour MIL is experiencing an attachment and entitlement to your baby that is in psychosis territory. Your husband is not standing up for the safety of you and your baby. He needs to remind himself that yes, she sacrificed a lot for him, but she was the ADULT.
