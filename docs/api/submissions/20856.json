It got to a head when she did more \u2018research\u2019 and concluded that her grandson cannot have formal and must be breastfed. After months of her sending me articles about how formula is poison I finally told her we will just breastfeed despite the fact that I wasn\u2019t really planning on it. \n\nCome the day I have my son and it is a traumatic birth. 50 hours in labor just for me to hemorrhage and having to get a C-section. My son had a few complications and had to be in the nicu. Between the stress of it all\u2026 my supply never really came in. By day 3 I was scared to not feed my child more than a couple ounces so I put him on formula to supplement the first few weeks. My mil was furious and the day we brought him home she had a breakdown because I was \u2018going to kill her baby\u2019 if I didn\u2019t breastfeed. \nAfter a few weeks we were trying anything to increase my supply and it was slowly going up. As I was still healing , my MIL went grocery shopping for us. She knows I am allergic to coconut as she has seen me have a reaction before and we have reminded her many times. \nWell that night she brought me my waterbottle that was filled with juice.  Except it wasn\u2019t juice, it was body armor. A coconut water energy drink. It didn\u2019t taste like coconut so I drank a lot of it. It I need to go to the hospital 3 weeks post op because my throat was closing. My husband was furious but assured me it was probably an accident. \nWell it wasn\u2019t. My mil asked me a few days later if I felt like it helped my supply at all. Apparently she did more \u2018research\u2019 and saw that some people claimed body armor increased their supply like crazy so she figured \u2018you have an epi pen it wouldn\u2019t kill you, plus if it helps the baby that\u2019s what matters\u2019.\n I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the hormones or if it is justified but I cussed her out and told her to leave my house.

It isn\u2019t poison and if your child is healthy, well nourished and happy that is literally all that matters. I can\u2019t stand that mom shaming bull shit.", "NTA. Your husband is at best an enabling idiot at worst he really doesn\u2019t care that you could have died.  I am so sorry you are being pressured and harrassed. Many women find breastfeeding difficult for a range of reasons and your MIL needs to\nGet her facts from an actual dr not dr google", "NTA.\n\nThis woman is \\*dangerous\\* - she quite literally rationalises away nearly giving you a fatal allergic reaction as if it were nothing, and she admits to doing it on purpose.\n\nIf someone is capable of doing that to you and \\*still\\* thinks they're on the right track for doing it, there's something seriously seriously seriously not right. And if your husband won't accept that forcing someone to have an allergic reaction for a bit of breast milk (when, yes, formula is perfectly valid to use) is completely \\*bonkers\\*, then maybe he isn't worth the marriage, either.\n\nI am so, so sorry you had to deal with that at all, especially \\*right\\* after having your child.\n\nI do not blame you for wanting her as far away as you can get her.\n\nI also think her flipping out on you for not producing a load of breast milk is itself something that would warrant a serious damn discussion about whether or not you want her around when you have literally just had a child.\n\n  \nEDIT: I also don't buy that she wouldn't have known Body Armor is coconut. Because her \"doing her research\" means she would've come across that tidbit very very quickly.", "NTA! Your MIL sounds unhinged and the only doctor she should be talking to is a therapist. Does your husband not understand that his mother intentionally poisoned you? What if your baby develops allergies and she disregards them because she knows better? Repeated exposure to allergens is super dangerous and can make your reactions get worse!! You are right and you can not trust her with your baby. You need to sit your husband down and have a serious meeting. Your husband is being wildly underdramatic, this is a big deal!!", "NTA and I think this goes *far* beyond almost killing you, which is the weirdest thing I've typed so far today.   \n\n\nThere is some underlying issue here with her that urgently needs to be evaluated. I'm not even saying that unkindly -- she just doesn't appear to be emotionally stable or rational at the moment. I don't think she would intentionally hurt the baby, but ignorance is often just as deadly as negligence. Your husband needs to understand just how seriously she betrayed you with that coconut stunt. You *do not* do that to another human. It's literally a recipe for homicide.   \n\n\nYour husband needs to understand the gravity of the situation. Hopefully you get lots of good replies in this thread and can print them out to prove that to him.", "Woah what the fuck?? NTA at all. I personally would cut your MIL off entirely. She could have killed you and your husband is downplaying it too", "NTA and husbands reaction is a red flag", " NTA. Your husband is TA for not standing up for you after dealing with birth complications and having to deal with an overbearing MIL. If that problem isn\u2019t addressed while the kids are young it\u2019s certainly going to be harder when they get older because she\u2019s going to want more control. Talk to your husband, go to marriage counseling if necessary but please express how what she did literally could have been attempted murder had you not been able to get help.

You do not need the pressure of your MIL telling you what\u2019s best for your baby. YOUR Baby, not hers. \n\nPlus your husband needs to step up. If his mother is like this he\u2019s going to be scared of her, so it\u2019ll be hard for him. However he needs to understand that you and the baby are his family, and this woman is trying to affect both of your welfare.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL is a danger to you AND your baby.

I would file for a restraining order, and I would not let her anywhere near you or your child.  And I would seriously think about criminal charges  This woman is deranged - she deliberately gave you something that she KNEW almost certainly would have killed you.  My guess is that she's been nice to you so she could get a grandchild.  You were an incubator to her, now you're a walking milk supply.  She may decide that now you're just in the way of her bonding with baby.  And your husband is in an amazing level of denial, and he needs to sober up, FAST!  What his mother did could, and in some places would, be charged as a serious crime.  This was cold-blooded in the extreme. Please don't let them gaslight you into thinking this is somehow okay, or excusable, or an isolated incident.  Your life may depend on it (no exaggeration).", "Obviously NTA - she is a dangerous person and you should not allow a child anywhere near her. She needs therapy and time to work on herself. I hope you\u2019re feeling better.", "NTA. She could've killed you. Your husband needs to realize that. I know for my dad if his mother in law or his mother did something like that, he would kick them out of the house and not allow them to visit their grandchild until they have apologized to you and proven that they can be trusted to follow directions. Whether you want to breastfeed or not is your choice.", "NTA. File a police report and get a restraining order. She knows what she did. And if your husband won't back you up... it's marriage counseling or divorce. She tried to kill you!", "NTA. Your husband needs to set boundaries with her. That is *his* mother and *his* responsibility. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to decide how you raise your baby, she already raised hers.", "NTA she sounds unhinged.  And btw many women have issues breastfeeding.  Don't stress about formula.  In a perfect world every kid would be exclusively breastfed but be happy that formula exists unlike years ago.  If you want to and can breastfeed any amount and also feed formula that's perfect.  If you want to stop stressing over breastfeeding and feed just formula that's fine too.  Being stressed over it won't help and as a new mom you have enough stress as it is, especially with weird MIL in the background.\n\nI wouldn't let her near your kid.  God forbid he gets a peanut allergy and she thinks it's no big deal.", "NTA- see you soon on r/JUSTNOMIL .. You are not being over dramatic. This was intentional bodily harm and she should not be around you, your baby, or in your house. I would go NC and tell your husband if he has a problem with this and enables this type of blatant behavior then he can go with her.", "NTA But you MIL needs to stay the hell away from you.  Your husband needs to stand up to her. You're not overreacting.  Honestly, if you cut contact I don't think anyone would blame you.  She's more than crossed the line and you might even be able to have her criminally charged for what she did.", "She knowingly gave you something that could kill you and your husband thinks YOUR the dramatic one? You could have died and he just shrugs his shoulders? F that. Divorce. \n\nNTA", "NTA - It sounds like she has fallen into the rabbit hole of online mommy groups and thrown out all common sense. She needs to be banned from the house for a long time, and should probably seek mental help for whatever the heck is wrong in her head to do such a thing. Hubby can go see her at her house if he wants to socialize.", "NTA. NTA for your reaction. The main issue is that your husband is not on board so there is really no way to ban her from the baby. He disagrees and you are equal parents. At minimum tell him there needs to be a MIL time-out until you have recovered from your surgery. \n\nThat being said, I had no idea Body Armour is coconut water based and my teen at home is allergic to coconut so good information to have.", "NTA and she did it intentionally so could be charged with battery!!!", "NTA. Get that woman away from you and your child. All you need to know is she said \"I was going to kill her baby.\" Her baby! The woman is deranged and dangerous. If your husband is not onboard, leave and file a police report. She tried to kill you.", "You have a husband problem. If he thinks you're being dramatic after being intentionally poisoned by his mother, you're in for a very rocky time.", "NTA.  She tried to kill you to raise your baby. If your hubby can\u2019t see and understand that you have a big hubby issue", "NTA My question would be why did you let it get this far. You need to set clear boundaries and then follow them. Also communicate to her that you are uncomfortable when you are uncomfortable, she is obviously absolutely horrible at reading human body language, and possibly verbal language. Both my parents are horrible at communicating for different reasons. From what you wrote it looks like she might mean well. So then it sadly becomes on you and more your husband since it's his mom to start parenting her. We all have to parent our parents at some point, that's how you actually get rid of generational trauma. From personal experience, you're going to need to set those boundaries, tell her about them, and then continue telling her about them and following them, because she will break them without question for months if not years. Good luck. Also considering you have a newborn baby you don't need to do any of this right now but don't put it off for too long.", "NTA! What the actual f***! She purposely gave you coconut water! She could\u2019ve killed you! She can\u2019t be trusted and should be no where around you or your baby", "NTA. Tell him that either she goes, or you and the baby will and you might press charges. She knows you are allergic and still gave you the coconut water.", "NTA. What did she think the epinephrine in your system would do to the baby? I don\u2019t know if that crosses into breast milk but I guarantee she doesn\u2019t know either. \n\nAlso, ask her how all of us (meaning me) adopted babies survived off of formula! I\u2019m dying to know how we survived the poison. She needs to go", "NTA - sounds like you have more of a husband problem. Your MIL intentionally disregarded your life and your husband is defending her. If you can, you should move in with someone in your support system and let your husband think about his priorities...", "NTA you should file a police report", "NTA\n\nThis woman tried to kill you. I need you to realize this. You have an allergy that can be fatal, hence you have an epi pen. She knows you have a potentially fatal allergy, and she *deliberately gave you your allergen anyway*. She **tried to kill you**. An epi pen is not a magical shield against death from an allergen, it\u2019s a last ditch attempt to keep you from dying while you get to a hospital. You can still die from anaphylaxis if you use an epi pen *especially* if you don\u2019t get prompt medical care afterwards. This is akin to shooting someone in front of a hospital and claiming it\u2019s fine because the hospital has a good trauma center and they knew the doctors would be able to treat the bullet wounds just fine. She tried to kill you. You and *especially* your husband are SEVERELY underreacting to this. You need to report this to the police and she needs to never be within 200 feet of you or any of your food again.", "NTA. Your husband thinks that you\u2019re being overly dramatic because you don\u2019t trust her after she knowingly harmed you and seriously risked your life!? I get that your husband loves his mom, but no, you are not being overly dramatic and his lack of concern over this incident is alarming. He needs to think about how far this \u201cgrandma knows best\u201d issue can go and the problems it can cause. You both need to set strict boundaries with her, and she needs to know that after her stint she is not trusted and is on serious probation with you.", "Sorry OP. You also have a husband problem. Not just MIL problem. Please do talk to him regarding boundaries. So it\u2019s ok if the baby\u2019s mom dies? Your husband said you are \u201cdramatic\u201d. That\u2019s a low blow OP. I\u2019m so sorry this happened, but you did good. Keep up those boundaries. NTA", "Food tampering is a crime. Your MIL is a dangerous person who can\u2019t be trusted around you and certainly cannot be safely in contact with your helpless newborn. I can understand and how someone who was raised by a sneaky and manipulative mother would have a great deal of trouble coming to terms with the fact that his mom tried to kill his wife, but he needs to be brought around to your viewpoint here as quickly as possible. Ask him how he\u2019d feel about the situation if the person who poisoned you had been anyone but his mom. Ask how he might feel if your child ends up with a food allergy and his mom tries to sneak that allergen in your child\u2019s diet because she decides it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d for them. Ask him how he\u2019d react if it had been YOUR mother who poisoned you. That might help give him perspective. Then go together and file a police report and restraining order before she tries this again. \nThis is not a minor thing, but neither was her harassing you about how you feed your child. If he\u2019d put her firmly in her place when that talk started, this whole situation might have been avoided. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I was harassed by my mil about my inability to breastfeed, right up until we cut her out of our lives and never looked back. Going NC with her saved my marriage, and saved us years of unnecessary stress and heartache. Some people are just toxic. In your case your mil is both toxic and criminal. \nObviously, NTA", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t care if you were in ICU as long as HER baby got breast milk out of it. She is mentally unstable. I\u2019d be concerned there\u2019s some codependency going on between her and her son.", "NTA. I'd seek legal action. She endangered your life and by extension, your child's. At minimum, you should have a restraining order.", "Lady Farquaad here is a menace ( \"Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make,\"). She was clearly willing to risk your death, and probably would have been happier that way, as your spineless husband would have just let her raise your child as she wished. He needs to pull his head out of his ass, and she needs to be put in a very long timeout. And jail. Jail would be good. NTA", "I mean it sounds like she just thought body armor would help your supply and maybe didn\u2019t know it was a coconut drink.  But if she really did intentionally give you coconut, that seems criminal and if anything you under reacted.  Either way def NTA.", "I don\u2019t want to blame the victim here but op you need to realize that you helped create this monster and now you need to slay it. \n\nYou have been letting her walk all over you and now this habit is going to be hard to break. You need to put your foot down full stop. She is not allowed in your home for a LONG time and she will not speak a work about your parenting decisions. If she does you cut contact.

None of this. \n\nNTA", ">she cannot be trusted with my baby\n\nEh this may have been just a little over the top because she genuinely seems to care about her grandbaby, but it certainly was wrong of her to knowingly put you in danger. And like you like you said, it could possibly be the hormones making you react so strongly. I say NTA. You say you've had a pretty good relationship with her, please do what you can to maintain it, within reason of course. I'm not sure if she's really owed an apology from you (like that could have ended really badly, I'm glad it didn't!), but she most definitely owes you one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What she said was more or less this- when you're breastfeeding the little one is kind of cloning your immune system in a way through that breast milk. While you're breastfeeding, that little one will be allergic to the same things you are because they are getting the histamines thru your milk. ( that doesn't mean that they will forever be allergic to the same thing- just temporarily while you're breastfeeding)  Just because I no longer broke out in hives doesn't mean that I'm no longer allergic to them, it just meant that my system had the reaction under control.

Thank fuck I'm only allergic to a couple prescription meds cus if I'm the dumbass who'd take the epi pen and think I'm all good.", "I was thinking Criminal Minds or maybe Law & Order SVU.", "Nah man, that gave me horror movie vibes. This could literally be a thriller movie", "Hand That Rocks the Cradle vibes", "I could definitely see this crazy lady trying to kidnap the baby or something crazy like that", "i\u2019m not disagreeing with you at all, we\u2019re on the same page! there\u2019s definitely some form of extreme mental illness here, she needs serious help & i hope she can get it even if OP cuts all contact - and i hope to god she does.", "Fed is REQUIRED.", "Yeesh, that's a lot of shots. My son gets 1 shot a week.", "The damage done to that husband by his mom is far worse than anything in formula can do. There was an incident recently where a formula plant was not regulated properly and contaminated formula sickened, possibly fatally, a number of infants. Horrible. But as a given, formula isn't poison. And formula helped save my baby with jaundice. He just wasnt drinking enough because I didn't know how to breastfeed. We had to supplement with formula so he can flush out the excess bilirubin. OP was right to fear that baby might not be getting enough food. It makes me sick to my stomach that MIL endangered OP's life. Like if something happened and baby is without a mother, how was she going to deal with the repercussions of that? What child will thank grandma for killing their mom because she was against freaking formula?", "That for sure! \n\nNo question but I feel like this goes beyond that into some sort of... attempted... involuntary manslaughter? (I know that's not a real thing). Just saying... I'm no lawyer but I'd bet a good one would make something bigger stick, especially since MIL admits to knowingly giving it to her despite the risks.\n\nI'd want to keep myself and my kid as far from her as possible. Unfortunately it will likely destroy the marriage but if her husband's blood isn't boiling, ready to go NC, etc... then it's no real loss.\n\nSorry OP... I know it's not that simple. Love is complicated but death is permanent. \n\nTake care of you and that baby.", "Assault at a minimum.", "Hell yeah, not far off from it! MIL may not have had \"intent to kill\" (she obviously wants OP around for her milk) but intent doesn't mean you can't be charged on the potential outcome, which was death.", "We found the MIL", ">a good relationship\n\nA person who casually tries to murder you is not a person with whom you have a good relationship.", "um no, it's a dig at MIL", "It\u2019s just **attempted** murder, not **successful** murder, what\u2019s the big deal? /s", "Do they give a Nobel prize for Attempted Chemistry?"]}
