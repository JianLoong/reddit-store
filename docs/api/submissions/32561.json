He's 10 years old coming from an abusive background and has some reaaallly experience with foster homes. He was so scared and shy at first and is taking him a while to open up and trust us. I (19F) am one of 2 of my siblings who he seems to trust. He barely talks to my parents or anyone else. We've spend the past week hanging out in the afternoon chatting and he seemed comfortable with me, I had never heard him talk so much, he's revealing his true colours and that makes me so happy...\n\nThe thing is, I have bad epilepsy and being chronically ill has impacted my mood significantly. Today he came into my room sat on my bed for our 'daily chat'. I immediately and very politely told him that I'm not feeling too great (I was feeling like I was about to have a seizure). His brain didn't seem to register it, he ignored it, idk what and went on telling me about what he did at school. I sat and listened until I started feeling really really unwell and I asked him to go and i'll meet him later. He didn't seem to register that either and did the thing children do of asking you the same question 5 times in a row. At this point my head was hurting so much, I wasn't myself, I raised my voice and told him to \"just go away Matthew\", angrily. \n\nHe looked so scared and run out of my room. I tried to speak to him after my seizure, but he does his best to avoid me. \n\nThe fact that I'm one of my parents' biological children makes me feel worse about it.\n\nI needed to vent, thanks for reading, as well", "created_utc": 1701976371, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d305s/aita_for_telling_my_newly_adopted_brother_to_go/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell him you hate other people seeing you when it happens. You are sorry for shouting, and you are sorry for scaring him. You enjoy his company, but there will be times when you need to be left alone. Ask him if he can please leave the room quickly when you say you are about to have a seizure. That way, you get to have time together, but you know that he is a good enough brother to give you space until your seizure is over and you are up to peopling again.", "NAH\n\nYou acted the way you did because of a medical condition that is outside your control.  Matthew acted the way he did because of likely past trauma that is outside his control.  \n\nYou're not at fault here, but you might try to make it up to Matthew by arranging a special night/outing where you can explain to him about your medical condition and why you acted the way you did.  He just needs to understand that sometimes you are not going to be available to him (though if there are things he can do for you when you're feeling unwell, he might be willing to interact with you that way), but that it's not his fault and because you're struggling with things outside your control...just like he is.  \n\nIf he still won't talk to you, you could leave a small gift for him with a note that says that you're sorry about what happened, you're really happy he's in your family now and you want him around forever, and that unfortunately, you have an illness that sometimes makes things hard for you.  But if he's willing, you'd like to set up a special movie night for the two of you with snacks that he can choose, and if he accepts, you can talk more about what happened then.  \n\nI was the bio kid with adopted and foster siblings, and I also struggled with my mental health, which meant I wasn't always able to be the sibling these kids needed.  Don't beat yourself up.  It's a tough role, and you're allowed to be a person with bad days too.", "NTA, just get him alone and talk to him until you feel he understands. He is very clearly traumatized, not stupid. And also he will likely be able to sense your sincerity even if he doesn't know it. Just level with him. You weren't feeling well, you snapped, you're okay.", "NAH\n\nThe way you are telling this story shows you have a tremendous amount of compassion and love for Matthew.  You were ill and trying to tell him in a kind way, but he just didn't understand.  When you feel better, go talk to him, explain to him you have an illness that will hit you suddenly and you sometimes need quiet until it passes.  Let him know you are not mad at him, and you can tell him about epilepsy as much as you feel he can understand.  \n\nHe will be ok; he just needs to know what happened.", "You were about to have a seizure. You asked politely several times. As someone who has had many foster kids, and adopted 2 of them, there is often a disconnect on what is socially acceptable. I think that's what is happening here. What you first told him might have been too vague. I'm not feeling well implies that you would like him to leave but it doesn't actually TELL him to leave. The second time you did say to leave  but, In the future you might, want to be more specific. Has anyone actually described to him what your seizures are like and how it affects you? It's unfortunate that you yelled at him but understandable under the circumstances. NTA", "Your NTA, you told him and he ignored it. You were not doing okay and you didn\u2019t over react at all, I believe what you did was right. Although I believe you should maybe let him know about these things so he can be sure to be more understanding  in the future.", "As an RN, I want to thank you for preventing the little guy from potentially watching you seize. Seizures are scary for me to watch and I'm not a 10 year old boy. You saved him from a possible traumatic experience and you're to be applauded for that.\nMaybe have a talk with him and include the other person he is comfortable with and your parents. Talk to him simply and have him give you a code word to say to him when you \"need a break\".", "You\u2019re not intentionally the ahole. I think Matthew is acting like that because of his background and the way you responded to him. I get you don\u2019t want him to see you literally have a seizure as that can be traumatic to watch. I think you should ask to talk to him and maybe with your parents so you can tell him about your medical condition and that you didn\u2019t mean to be snappy with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However maybe you should have a talk with Matthew and explain what you deal with.", "NAH\n\nSit Matthew down and talk with him so he understands. It's going to take time for him to understand that, in this household, someone raising their voice doesn't mean abuse is coming. Explain your epilepsy and have him understand that when you ask him to leave, it's not because he did anything wrong, but it's important that he listens. He will learn.", "NTA. I feel you are being parentified here. Are there no parents in the mix? Anyway, someone is going to have to explain Matthew about the epilepsy and the seizures, because it is going to happen again, and you need to have this boundary with him that you can make him go out of your room when you feel a seizure coming on. If he doesn't get it explained to him, he is going to think that it is his fault and that he hurt you in some way. You are not to blame, you have done amazing things for this boy already, and that can continue. But you are still not the parent, and every one should know that and act accordingly.", "I totally agree.\n\nMaybe If OP can 'sense' when shes going to have a seizure, perhaps when she talks to him after the dust has settled a little, she could use it as a way to help bond. He seems like he'll understand when she explains that she wasn't upset, just sick and it's hard to explain that in the moment. Maybe come up with a 'codeword' or hand signal that you guys can decide on to say and he'll know that you're experiencing something similar in future. Maybe you can hang a loop of ribbon on your door knob if you're feeling 'off' in advance so he can see he should come back later.  I think it'll work out, but we need to take care of ourselves too.", "this is a repost", "13 children? Massive yikes", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur parents are AHs to adopt kids and then neglect them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU are fine, you did NOT adopt him.", "Wasn't this exact same story posted here months ago?", "NAH. You had a medical thing going on that he didn\u2019t understand he was making worse. Maybe your next daily chat can be about how your epilepsy affects you so he can understand you a bit better.", "NAH. It is tremendously difficult to remain composed, patient, and empathetic under duress and it sounds like your condition was such that it was causing you pretty significant  concern (especially as you say, feeling like you were about to have a seizure).\n\nOn the other hand I can understand where your new sibling may not have the social mores and ability to read social cues that would have averted this.\n\nIf possible, I wonder if you would consider sitting down for a conversation with him (if able, I understand he's avoiding you now). Be honest, make the apology that feels right to you (I personally would be somewhere along the lines of \"I wasn't feeling well and needed time to take care of myself but that doesn't mean it was OK to raise my voice at you\"). Maybe even, if you're comfortable and willing, explain a little bit about your condition and then invite him to help you make plans for \"if this happens again\"?\n\nAll of the recommendations above are not anything you are at all required to do - but it might help build a bridge back with a frightened child who I expect, doesn't understand healthy family boundaries and dynamics. Allow both you and he a little bit of grace and compassion as you find your way forward. You sound like a really compassionate person who truly wants to see this child get to a place where he can thrive, but please don't burden yourself with guilt over this - you're only human, too.", "BIG NAH.  It's unfortunate that it happened, but it's no one's fault.  Tell Matthew exactly what happened, why you acted that way, and that it's not his fault.  Also, work out a plan between the two of you if it happens again, so he knows how to act in a way that helps you.  That will give him a feeling of agency and control, in an otherwise scarey situation.\n\nIt sounds like your family's made a great start with him.  I hope the poor kid continues to progress.", "I think the parents with far too many kids ight qualify as TA because how can you look after that many kids and do a proper job. It's just to many kids", "From your experience- is it really allowed in the foster system to have Thirteen kids in one household at one time?\n\nIf foster kids are supposed to be basically parented by the approved adult/couple, that seems impossible when their attention is split 13 ways.  It means the older kids are doing a lot of the foster kids care, not the system-approved adult."]}
