I\u2019ve (47m) never witnessed anything myself and don\u2019t really know these people. Everything I\u2019m about to write comes from what my wife (39f) has told me.\n\nThis situation is about the neighbors directly across the street. They moved in a couple of years ago and are a young couple. If I had to guess, I think they\u2019re in their early 30s. We wave to each other when we see each other and have said hi a few times but I don\u2019t know their names. I\u2019ll just call them Bob and Susan. Apparently Bob leaves for work earlier and comes home later than Susan.\n\nMy wife has a hybrid schedule where she works part of the week at the office and part of it at home. Her home office is in the front of our house and looks directly into the house across the street. Recently, she\u2019s been telling me that when she works from home, she sees a man visiting the neighbor\u2019s house either after Bob leaves for work or before he comes home. She swears she once saw adult activities between this stranger and Susan because their curtains were open. \n\nAt first it was just humorous but as the weeks pass, my wife has gotten more and more agitated with the situation. She wanted me to talk to Bob to tell him what\u2019s going on to which I refused because it\u2019s not our problem and we don\u2019t know if they have an arrangement. Then she started to take pics on her phone to show me the car and the guy. It was almost a fight to make her delete the pics. Now the agitation has turned into full blown anger at me. Basically she\u2019s mad that I\u2019m not more concern with Susan cheating on Bob. I told her I have our lives to live, I simply don\u2019t care what goes on in their house. This answer angered her so much she slept in the guest bedroom for a couple of nights. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing anything wrong by minding my own business but I also slept alone for a couple of nights.\n\nUpdate\n\nThanks for all of your opinions. I\u2019ll answer some of the questions you all have been asking.\n\n1. Why did I make her delete the pics? I\u2019m not a lawyer and I don\u2019t know the laws regarding taking people\u2019s pics without their consent. I figured it\u2019s safest to not have them. If things get out of hand and we get sued for invading privacy, we don\u2019t have money to waste on hiring a lawyer.\n\n2. Why doesn\u2019t my wife tell her themselves? She\u2019s an introvert and not comfortable with talking to someone she doesn\u2019t know. Also I\u2019m guessing that she thinks it\u2019s my job as a man to tell another man the bad news.\n\n3. For those who think I\u2019m TAH and why won\u2019t I get involved. I\u2019ve watched enough news to know that a domestic situation is the most dangerous most cop will face in their career. Cops are scared to go in with tools and backup. I\u2019ll be alone as the messenger. Also, where we live neighbors just don\u2019t get into other neighbor\u2019s businesses. Every year, there\u2019s a story on the news about some neighbor getting hurt or worse by telling their neighbor to turn down the music or don\u2019t cuss in front of children. These incidents are very common where we live. I don\u2019t need a hammer to my face.\n\n4. The comments about my wife thinking I\u2019m okay with infidelity really open my eyes. I never thought of that before and am grateful for this insight.

There are several plausible explanations for what she's seen that aren't an affair. And, even if it is an affair, she needs to be prepared to come off as the neighborhood snoop to the neighbors. Cause that's what she is. And she doesn't get to push off the social negatives of being the neighborhood snoop on you.

It was horrible.", "Except they\u2019re not concerned - because when I told them it was none of their business - they got angry with me and started spreading rumours. \n\nPeople don\u2019t give AF - they just want to be involved in drama, any drama - and they will go looking for it.", "Also, it\u2019s not my friends doing this because they know the details of my relationship. It\u2019s random busybodies like OP\u2019s wife.", "That wouldn\u2019t make sense. His wife would recognize him. The real plot twist is that while  Susan is getting visited by her mysterious stranger, Bob and OP are getting it on in a motel room.", "Insecurities rarely make sense. OP and their wife are partners and as such I don't think it's too much to ask that OP be sensitive to what their wife might be feeling. Sure, they don't HAVE to explain themself, but in the interest of open and healthy communication it makes much more sense to have an adult conversation about what they're both feeling and why than to bury it because they both think they're right. Little issues become big issues when people think the other party will come round to their way of thinking without any discussion.", "Thank you. I\u2019m too tired. \u201cSticking my nose all the way across the street\u201d is exactly right. That\u2019s too far for my nose to be traveling.", "I knew this guy who's wife had terrible migraines. His wife often saw a masseuse while he was off working as an exterminator. Whole town thought she was cheating on him but no one said a thing.", "Poly is NOT quite common.  What planet do you live on where Poly is common?  Read/research some data\u2026and stay off Starz channel.", "Found the poly", "Is one of your partners a secret from the other? In this context, it\u2019s clearly not the case if the homewrecker is dipping out before the other comes home.", "Infidelity is 100% wrong IMO but so is sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. They aren't friends or involved in each other's lives. They also have no idea what the dynamic of their marriage is. This wife is doing too much and needs to mind her own business.", "Fair point.\nOP, please check - this might be illegal according to your legislation. Your wife might make to want these pictures disappear, not mention them again and most of all stop incriminating herself.", "Literally how could she be charged for taking pictures. She's taking pictures of a suspicious man in the neighborhood (to her) and his car. OP never said she was taking pictures of the neighbors actively having sex or in the nude.", "This story reads like a Hitchcock movie.", "It's definitely illegal regardless of whether or not taking pictures/video of people in certain circumstances might be legal.\n\nThe wife suspects infidelity. That's very shitty for sure, but it's not a crime. What is a crime however is stalking. So is invasion of privacy. And that's exactly what the OPs wife and possibly even him would get charged with if the neighbors find out they've been recording them while in the supposed privacy of their own home.", "i mean, i'm not ashamed about anything in my sex life either, but i also don't want my neighbors watching it and commenting on it.\n\nnot. their. business.", "No worries. This sub is unpredictable.", "If she cares so much - why is she trying to make her husband talk to Bob? \n\nOther people committing infidelity in relationships that have nothing to do with you really *shouldn\u2019t* be a big deal. Keep your nose in your own business.", "No, it\u2019s not. You have no right to privacy in public. Period. I don\u2019t know where \u201cin the house\u201d is coming from anyways, no where does it say she took photos of him in the house, just a pic of him. That\u2019s it.", "The ABSOLUTE audacity. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you, what trash people!", "Yeah I don't get the smug comments from people in open relationships. The vast majority of people are very much not in open relationships. And even then, it's possible to also cheat in an open relationship. As long as their intentions are good, no issue.", "This exactly is why I don't mention my relationship dynamics at work. I pretend we're perfectly monogamous. We're neither perfect (perfection is a fallacy), nor monogamous, but we're happy and everything is above-board.", "The Art Room\u2122\ufe0f, actually.", "Plot twist, Bob and Susan have an open relationship.", "Also it sounds very much like he\u2019s declining to engage too much in this topic. To him that might seem perfectly normal: he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, because it\u2019s not his business. But she might be misinterpreting that as nonchalance towards infidelity. From there, it wouldn\u2019t even take that much anxiety to jump to \u201cif he doesn\u2019t condemn their infidelity maybe he thinks it\u2019s not a big deal?\u201d\n\nMy boyfriend and I have completely different communication types, so we make sure to be super clear with each other. \u201cHey I\u2019m too busy to engage with your meme rn, but I love your sense of humor\u201d goes a long way to alleviating my anxiety before it can fester into something bigger. \n\nPlus, this might feel like a big moral quandary to her! She knows someone is getting cheated on, and she knows she would want to know if it was happening to her. Inaction might feel really icky to her! And if OP doesn\u2019t want to stick his nose in, fair enough, but his wife might be wrestling with what to do and he just refuses to even listen to her vent/verbally work out the right thing to do. All that added to her potential insecurity that his avoidance of the topic is actually him silently condoning it, might be weighing on her. \n\nAnd all he has to do is give a tiny bit of explanation and reassurance to make sure they\u2019re on the same page!", ".... which sort of goes against your 'how many people are really Poly anyway?' argument when at least 2 of them found your specific comment on this specific post, doesn't it?", "That doesn't mean its a secret. Might just be a schedule conflict\n\nSure cheating is statistically more likely but would you like to face the embarrassment of admitting to your neighbor just how up in their business you are? Sounds like that's what OP is trying to avoid", "A friend was in a poly relationship and the caveat was that her monogamous partner not know her other partners. Different strokes for different folks. Make OP should look for an upside down pineapple lol \n\nBut seriously shes probably worried about their own relationship.", "I have had arrangements with partners where I had no need or desire to be there (usually because it's a guy and as a trans womam who primarily likes women or at leaat is not into cis men its just not my jam to be involved in) And not seeing all three at the same time does not mean that the husband doesn't know.", "Yes, they are involved in each others lives, they are neighbours across the street.\n\nTell me, if your neighbours house catches fire do you just leave it? Let them deal with it? Or are you so selfish you only say something because your own house may catch fire?\n\nGod damn do we ever have a fucked up view of society if our **fucking neighbours** are strangers to us.", "Rear Window one of my favs", "I totally get that but also understand the wanting to let someone know, if there is cheating involved. While it isn't the neighbors business, I would want to know if it was my partner 100%. While poly lifestyles are totally fine they aren't the majority of relationships, I'd say the chance of a cheating partner is high-ish.... And if no one is cheating they can just laugh at the busybody? I don't know what I would do, I'm not that observant anyway so I probably be wouldn't notice if it were me.", "Yes it is", "Yea the only horse she has in this race is to make sure her entertainment keeps going. Part of me thinks she wants her husband to go there just to stir shit up so she can watch from her window.", "Yeah it was absolutely ridiculous. \n\nIt what makes me think the majority of people aren\u2019t acting out of sympathy - they just want to be involved in other peoples drama/cause drama so they have something to talk about. \n\nThankfully pretty much everyone told my coworker to shut up and that they weren\u2019t interested in other peoples relationships and then discreetly let me know what was going on. \nShe left the office for a new workplace soon after thank god!", "It's not smug, I would rather defuse the situation and not react than have someone dig deeper into my personal, romantic relationships. My coworker talks down on couples who are open and she herself is single; if she saw either of us on tinder, I wouldn't want her to get herself worked up and outraged for me, take photos, etc. Additionally, maybe it sounds smug because this exact conversation comes up and we are comfy and confident in our other partners/'s activities, like if the other person is on tinder, taking a break, planning a date, cooking dinner, meeting with a platonic friend, etc.", "\u201cAs long as their intentions are good, no issue\u201d\n\nNo. Intention is meaningless if you don\u2019t consider the impact of the well-intended action. Impact trumps intention every single time. \n\nWe\u2019re not smug - we\u2019re trying to protect each other because nosey AH\u2019s think they have a right to spy and stick their noses in based on nothing more than assumptions.", "Same - I\u2019m in a new workplace and none of them have met my partner and they won\u2019t. We\u2019ve decided to keep our professional lives entirely seperate from our personal lives so I don\u2019t have to experience that again. \n\nPeople are also much, much crueler to me as a woman when they find out. They mostly just ask my partner questions about how I feel about it LOL", "So. Poly people are more vocal than they are numerous. We haven\u2019t heard how many Non poly people read it but did not respond. I found some statistics that said that only 4 percent of people are poly. Compared to 96 that are not (and many of those 96 cheat)", "I mean if I\u2019m getting cheated on and found out my neighbors knew, I\u2019d be even more upsetti spaghetti. \u201cSchedule conflict\u201d yes and the conflict is always when one is away. Never on weekends, holidays, or any other time of the year do they get together according to OP\u2019s wife. It\u2019s nonsense like this that give polyamory a bad reputation, when there\u2019s so many instances where it genuinely works out.", "Of course she is, who wouldn\u2019t be with a partner that\u2019s nonchalant with infidelity. OP\u2019s wife is being a busybody, but it seems like their main issue is that he\u2019s not on \u201cher side\u201d, which in turn makes her come to the conclusion that OP thinks it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d. They need to have a long talk tbh.", "LMAO no it's fucked up that people are so damn nosey. We've lived in our home for 3 years and I barely learned my neighbor's name a few months ago and that's only cause we got her mail. We say hi and are cordial but not friends by any means. If you want to be goofy enough to compare a house fire to the wife being nosey go ahead LMAO something tells me you're the wife in your neighborhood. Mind your business and let people live their lives without your face in their business.", "ah, but the point is they don't know these people.  at all.  OP said he doesn't even know the guy's name.  so, yeah, going up to essentially a stranger and saying \"hey, my wife watches your house all the time and thinks your wife might be cheating on you...\"  is not going to be a welcome conversation.  there are so many possible scenarios, including the husband not caring so long as he doesn't know.  it's just butting in when you have no idea what the hell is going on, have no context, and no idea what the people involved think about it.\n\nsome people may just be able to \"laugh at the busybody\", but just as likely (if not more so) is the \"why the hell are you watching my house all the time, creepy weirdo?\"", "Sorry to hear that, sounds super shitty! I think some people also want to be saviours and feel all righteous about \u2018saving\u2019 you from your partner, then get pissy when you deny them that narrative they\u2019ve created for themselves", "Poly does not always mean each partner is involved with each other. Plenty of healthy poly people I know personally have arrangements as a whole or regarding specific partners that don't require them to be involved or in the radar of the other partner beyond communication between the primary couple who each have other partners. \n\nPersonally I've reached the point where I prefer most of partners be into my other partners, which happens but not always. Bud goddess damn when it does, a pile of us naked girls is the best feeling.", ">found out my neighbors knew, I\u2019d be even more upsetti spaghetti\n\nWhy the neighbors didn't cheat, they don't owe you anything, it is none of their business?", "But there is a huuuge difference between being nonchalant about others infidelity and being nonchalant about your own infidelity. \n\nLike there are tons of things I care about in regards to my partner what they do, how they act that I don't care about in others. \n\nI think wife needs to stop working from home or change the location in the house if they are getting this worked up/invested in what happens at the neighbors house.", "Nope, but if I see something I say something. So, I suppose you are the type of person that is ok with being cheated on? Right, like you wouldnt want a neighbour saying something to you about it? Thats wild man, just wild.", "There are a hundred scenarios. People that have a STD because their partner is cheating on them and they don't know about it also can't just laugh that off, or spend years and years with an unfaithful partner when they could have spent that time with someone honest that loves them.  I don't think anything is that clear cut. The OP says the office faces the house, I don't think the spying was intentional but if you found out something about someone else that could be detrimental maybe its best not to say anything, but I also get why a person would feel wrong not saying anything. I don't think there's a clear-cut asshole in this situation.", "100%. \n\nThey usually then spin a narrative that my partner has \u201cforced\u201d me to \u201copen the relationship\u201d. \n\nLots of mono people will just flat out refuse to accept that ENM exists and people can be happy that way.", ">it is none of their business.\n\nPeople always want to pull \"spectators\" as witnesses.", "LMAO no you're a nosey busy body and that neighbor that people roll their eyes at and go inside fast to avoid. We all have one and nobody likes them LMAO. You literally have no clue what's happening just because your nosey ass stares out window and makes assumptions about what you don't know then create unnecessary drama by your assumptions. My oldest son's dad cheated and I packed his shit and set it outside so the nosey neighbors such as yourself could watch. I'm 100% against cheating but I'm also 100% mind your damn business if it doesn't affect you or yours. But do you LMAO. Bet you're super popular in your neighborhood \ud83d\ude02."]}
