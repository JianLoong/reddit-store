I think you maybe missed something important here. Why didn\u2019t your daughter tell you she had a boyfriend? Also, if she was concerned about staying alone with her 12 yo brother why was that not discussed? \n\nYour daughter is 17. I understand being upset with her not being honest but what exactly is banning her from seeing her boyfriend going to solve? What\u2019s the lesson you\u2019re teaching her? \n\nYTA \u2014 you overreacted. Talk to your daughter, maybe you will learn something about her.", "INFO: how do you expect to enforce this ban?", "the fact you don't know ur own daughter has a boyfriend says something here....", "INFO\n\nDid you ever had a convo with your daughter before about your (house) rules/expectations when it comes to dating?", "The best way to make sure that someone sticks with a person for longer is to ban them lol. How do you even think that is going to work?\n\nHonestly, expected teen behavior and expected adult response though I would suggest figuring out something different than banning.\n\nETA: make sure you daughter has access to contraception.", "From personal experience, this kind of approach backfires more often than not. I would not ban him outright and properly communicate your concerns and the potential dangers. Not allowing him in the house while you\u2019re not there and staying the night makes total sense, but banning her from seeing him will only make things worse", "What she did was inappropriate and there's not a problem with you feeling that way. However, I assume this is the first time anything like this has happened, and they otherwise behaved responsibility. \n\nBased on those assumptions (correct me if they are wrong) your punishment is far too severe. This is only going to create resentment and increase the chance of further teenage rebellion. YTA.\n\nEDIT: I assume this type of \"you can't have nice things\" punishment has happened before which is probably a reason why you and your daughter have a shaky relationship. \n\nKindness goes a long way. Enquire about her boyfriend. Maybe even meet him. He could be a nice chap that you would want in your home.", "YTA - did you ask to meet the guy? Talk to her about why this was inappropriate? Ask her about her concerns about you leaving her and her brother alone? \n\nIm not seeing any concern here, just punishment.", "ESH, she should've asked but banning her from seeing him is not the way to go, plus she'll be 18 soon what are you going to do then? \n\nAlso the fact that you didn't even know that your daughter was dating someone tells me that she's either afraid of telling you things or that you're just not around much so no point on telling you stuff.\n\nAlso how often do you leave one of your children to parent the others?", "YTA --- It's attitudes like yours that end up with girls her age getting pregnant and not telling their own parents purely out of fear of their reaction.", "YTA\n\nBig time.\n\nYou want a 17 year old to parent a 12 year old.\n\nYou put the responsibilities of an adult on your daughter without giving her the freedom an adult has.\n\nThat's pretty shitty behaviour on your end.\n\nIf she is old enought to parent her 12year old brother for 2 days, she is old enough to have a boyfriend over.", "INFO: what do you mean 'banned'?

You didn't know about something this significant says a lot about you and your parenting.\n\nThe stupid thing is all you have done is pushed your kid away further and turned this into a \"us vs. them\" situation where they will trauma bond in addition to everything else.  Hopefully the school you sent your kid to actually teaches about safe sex, condom use, birth control and your kid is using those otherwise be prepared to be a grandma in the near future.", "YTA for not getting a babysitter in the first place. YTA even worse for admitting you've left them alone before and thinking that's ok just because they didn't object to it. Your daughter won't even share her social life with you, what makes you think she trusts you enough to defy your terrible (lack of) parenting? ETA 1-3 times a month you're forcing her to parent her kid brother for the entire weekend? So almost every weekend of her teenage years that she's never getting back she has to step up as a parent because her own parents want a break from being parents. Why did you even have kids? You suck!", "I\u2019ve raised two daughters\u2026..banning them from anything only makes them more defiant.  Good luck with that.", "YTA, I understand not wanting to have her have a guy sleep over and you\u2019re fully in your rights to not want that, since she is a teen, but she\u2019s nearly an adult and should be allowed to date. I\u2019m not surprised she hid this from you seeing how you reacted. I had supportive parents and I was still nervous telling them about my first boyfriend, I can\u2019t imagine how I would have felt had they reacted like you did.", "ESH.\n\nShe shouldn't have had someone over without permission while you were away, however, she is 17, she's one year away from being an adult, and as much as you can \"my house my rules it\" that's really not going to work for very long, and will likely just cause resentment.\n\nYou should talk to her and explain why she needs to ask to have people over and that you care about her safety.\n\nAbsolutely punish her, but banning her from seeing her boyfriend is draconian, and completely unenforceable, and is just going to cause her to see him in secret. You'll also destroy her trust, because she won't come to you if she has a problem with her friends or her boyfriend because she knows you'll just crack it with her.\n\nAlso \"taking away going out privelages\" is similarly draconian and unenforceable.\n\n\nBasically, your teenage, nearly adult daughter, did classic teenage nonesense, and while she should be punished, you overreacted", "This is a good path to choose if you want your daughter to choose between you and her boyfriend. Trouble is, I hope you don't want her to make that choice.", "I had an overbearing, strict mom. I did everything behind her back because I couldn\u2019t talk to her about anything!

You don\u2019t get to leave your 17 year old alone to parent your 12 year old for up to 12 days a month and expect her to not have the same freedoms an adult has. There\u2019s a reason that your daughter doesn\u2019t tell you things, and I\u2019m sorry to tell you that based on the comments, you\u2019re on the fast track to your daughter moving out as soon as she can and severely limiting contact with you.\n\nDo you even know anything about him? How long they\u2019ve been together? Your son likes him and sees him as someone he\u2019s close to, so they obviously spend time together. And your daughter has seen her sister stay over with her boyfriend when she\u2019s in charge. You seem like you\u2019ve been an absent parent, so why would she not be making decisions for herself? It\u2019s what you\u2019ve trained her to do.", "Soft YTA. Banning her going out privileges includes not seeing her boyfriend. Banning any relationship ever again ensures she will do worse misdeeds and do them with him.", "YTA and the punishment seems way too harsh considering the \"crime\" here. And as other ppl have said before, you should stop and think why didn't you know about the boyfriend before? Why does your daughter feel like she has to hide stuff from you? Yes, she behaved in an inappropriate way, but at the same time, this kind of behaviour from a teenager isn't that weird and your \"You cannot leave house at all and you must break up with your bf\" is going too far.\nDo you think that after this nuclear reaction she will tell stuff to you in the future? What if one time, when she breaks rules, she gets hurt and she thinks that she can't tell you bc you will punish her?", "YTA. Your gardener knows your daughter has a boyfriend, but not you. How creepy is that. Maybe you should take more of your anger out on your gardener for spying on your daughter. She most likely didn't feel safe with the gardener around. Maybe you should try to have a more open and honest discussion with your daughter, so she feels like she can trust you. She is almost a legal adult. She is allowed to start making some of her own choices. You won't break them up. By not allowing it, all you are going to do is push them closer together. Maybe you should at least meet him before jumping to conclusions about him.", "Sorry, but I think this is a massive overcorrection that is almost guaranteed to backfire. She shouldn't have had her bf over without permission but it's kinda wild to me that you trust your daughter to be mature enough to act as a replacement parent to a 12 year old but not mature enough to have her boyfriend over. \n\nESH, I guess. But it's worth asking yourself why she kept this a secret from you specifically.", "YTA do not leave your 12 year old overnight in the care of a 17 year old two nights is worse.  Also she's 17 what did you think was going to happen?  Any answer other than, have her boyfriend over is delusional.  She's at the point of having him over multiple nights, how do you not know she has a boyfriend?  On top of that, blowing up over it is pointless, provided he's a suitable age this is fine.  Horny teenagers will horny teenager, she's old enough to make her own decisions and be aware of potential consequences.  Make sure she used protection, tell her not to do it again and move on.  Then don't leave a 12 year old boy in the care of a teenager for multiple nights!  Bad parenting at every step here.", "Soft YTA. Yes, it's your house and your rules, and you are within your rights as her mother to punish her. However, the fact of the matter is, when the parents forbid the kid to see their bf/gf **at all**, it only serves to bring them closer to the bf/gf and find ways to be together behind your back, which can lead to sex and teen pregnancy. You can let the grounding punishment stand, but instead of banning the bf, ask to meet him and his parents. Don't be aftaid to ask him tough questions, and get his parents' perspective on their relationship. Keep the lines of communication open between you and both of your kids, and try to be a little more understanding of where they're coming from. You were 17 once, too, and you remember what it was like to sneak things behind your parents' back. Maybe not an entire relationship, but you get the picture.", "LOL banned her from seeing him. Weren't you 17 before? You are making him 1000x more irresistible to her. \n\nRemember college? All of the people with \"strict parents\" ended up dropping out the first year because of pregnancy or binge drinking. First sniff of independence when they are adults on their own.", "Yeah. Banning her from seeing her BF is only going to stain your relationship even more. \nShe'll get more sneaky and less likely to come to you with a problem.", "YTA simply for making your daughter take care of a child for up to 4 days but not to manage a relationship. Wth is wrong with you. She either responsible or not.\n\nAlso judging by all your responses you have no idea what is happening in your kids life...wonder why", "Pretty sure OP is the type of mum who just chuckles and mumbles 'boys will be boy's when her son is 17 and gets caught with his girlfriend.", "YTA big time.\n\nWhen is this boomer idea that you're in charge of your daughter's \"purity\" going to die? It's her body, her decisions. \n\nI hope she ghosts your toxic ass the first opportunity she gets.\n\nI also hope that there is some safe adult in this young girls life she can trust to confide in and go to when she needs help working out her feelings and tricky adult situations. You're obviously not a safe person to talk to. Do you realize how difficult and dangerous it is for a young girl to navigate growing up in this world without help from a trusted elder?  Horrible, awful parenting.", "YTA", "YTA", "I understand that you might find it inappropriate to have him stay over for 2 nights, especially when you\u2019ve never met him before but YTA. Your daughter probably did not feel safe if she\u2019s only at home with her brother who isn\u2019t even a teenager yet. Even if she just wanted to find an excuse to bring her boyfriend over, I would suggest getting to know him first instead of completely banning her from seeing him. After getting the chance to know him, you might realise that he\u2019s actually a pretty decent guy who genuinely cares for your daughter. Chances are forbidding her from being able to see him would just to lead her sneaking out or finding other ways to meet him and puts on strain on your relationship with her. You should only be banning her from seeing him if you really think that he has a negative influence on daughter and doesn\u2019t have the right personality. I get that you were probably just worried, but the way you acted was rather extreme and doesn\u2019t solve the core issue of there being a lack of communication and trust between the two of you.\n\n+ Even if she did invite him for inappropriate reasons which I probably don\u2019t even need to specify, banning her won\u2019t change anything ? Proper communication does.", "YTA. Telling her no sleepovers, ok fine but even then they can still do the same things at noon.... but banning her from him altogether will backfire. \n\nI think the bigger question is why didn't your daughter feel comfortable telling you she has a boyfriend, and also ensuring she felt comfortable with the responsibility of caring for her sibling alone.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't stop the staff, your 17yo daughter, from having a life. \n\nYou are banning her from her car, I assumed you bought\n\nYou are banning her from leaving the house?\n\nYour 19yo is allowed to have a boyfriend of three years, why isn't the help, your 17yo allowed to have one now?", "YTA\u2026 you should ask yourself what you were doing at 17 which was so much better", "YTA\n\nYour 17 y/o is not an interim parent for when you want to have a vacation. Either take your 12 y/o child with you or hire a proper babysitter. \nAnd since you want her to act like an adult, maybe start treating her like one.", "YTA, your daughter will still see him regardless, in fact she is likely more determined now you have banned her.\n\nYou handled this badly and now your daughter is likely to rebel", "YTA\n\nMajor major time. The fact she never told you shows that she doesn't trust you as it is. And you doing this is damaging your relationship with your daughter severely. She is 17, not a toddler. It's sad to see that there are parents like this. If you guys had a strong trustworthy bond, then she would have probably felt more comfortable telling you about her boyfriend. The fact she did it in secret says a lot. It shows she knew you would react this way. I'm guessing you react this way with a lot of things. If you keep this behaviour up, you will most likely never see her again once she has moved out the house.", "YTA. your daughter is almost an adult. you expect her to act like an adult when you need someone to parent your son, but get mad that she has adult relationships. pretty pathetic.", "Ew I would not be surprised if she goes off to college and becomes super distant", "YTA, and soon enough, you won't need to worry because she'll be off and low contact if any with you.  Wow, you literally went from 0-60 on her backside, yet you dump her brother on her. He's your kid, let her stay home and find somewhere for her brother to stay, she's a sibling, not a parent.", "I cant imagine why she didn\u2019t tell you she had a boyfriend. YTA.", "A bit of both. YTA because you acted on emotion of being hurt your daughter didn\u2019t ask permission for her boyfriend (who you didn\u2019t know about) to stay over. Yes this is bad she should\u2019ve let you know and yes maybe the punishment is accurate but banning her from seeing said boyfriend isn\u2019t helping anything. \nStrict parents make sneaky kids. \nLike how did your daughter have a whole boyfriend that you didn\u2019t know about? Does she not feel safe telling you these things? I had the same issue with my own mother, never knew how she would react to me telling her or asking her anything to the point I just didn\u2019t anymore. I just want you think how a teenager would in this situation. You got banned from seeing said boyfriend, do you really think she\u2019s just not gonna find a way to see him? She can\u2019t go out willingly or with your permission? What would a normal teenager do in that situation\u2026 sneak out. Which is way more dangerous than her just having him come over, to a house that\u2019s safe. On top of that most teenagers don\u2019t have a bf stay over unless they\u2019ve been together for awhile. So who knows how long this relationship has been going on, also I\u2019d say that the fact your gardener knows more about your daughters personal life than you do says a lot about your mother daughter relationship.\n\nEdit: I reread OPs post. Having a 17 year old FEMALE watching her 12 year old brother for a few days and nights by herself is just asking for something bad to happen. If any criminal knew about this who knows what could\u2019ve happened. That\u2019s just irresponsible on your part. She\u2019s almost 18 but that doesn\u2019t mean she capable of defending herself and her little brother!", "NTA  Your daughter knew you wouldn't want her to sex before marriage in your house. It sounds like this rule was well set up because she said she knew you wouldn't say yes. Since boyfriend didn't come until after you were gone but had left before you got back suggests that she told him about it too. So they both worked together to break your set boundaries. If she was worried about not having a man around she could have told you earlier and you could have maybe had someone come in or her go stay with a trusted friend or family member to babysit her. How is she planning on going to college if she can't stay overnight without a man?", "ESH. Your daughter snuck around and lied. Typical teen behavior but deserves a punishment. \n\nYou went over the top with banning her from him completely and it will negatively effect your relationship with her.", "YTA", "ESH.\n\nShe was wrong to bring her BF over without permission.\n\nBut banning her from seeing him altogether, and taking away her going out privileges, is an overreaction, IMO.", "Plot twist: the gardener is the boyfriend.\n\nYTA for leaving a 12yo in the charge of a 17yo so irresponsible that she will allow a boyfriend you know nothing about to spend the night. \n\nExtra AH points for not being involved with your daughter to know she has a bf.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, you will have a baby to add to the mix in just a few months.", "ESH. I don't think your reaction will benefit the situation, but I don't think you're wrong. You had an overnight visitor alone with your child that you hadn't met and had no prior knowledge of. You should have explained to your daughter that's a massive safeguarding issue. If she's old enough to have overnight sleeping partners she's old enough to understand that her safety is not the only one at stake.", "YTA", "If I had a mother like you I would lie as well maybe be a parent and not make your 17 year old watch her brother so you can go on a trip and none of this would have happened", "YTA - why didn't you raise your daughter to be strong and independent rather than needing a man to keep her safe.  So, much built in misogyny.", "ESH. If your daughter wants to be treated like an adult, she should act like one. She should have asked permission. The fact you didn\u2019t even know she had a boyfriend raises red flags about your relationship and communication. However, she is about to be 17 and you will have no say. Banning the boyfriend isn\u2019t really the smart move. Especially if you do not want to push your daughter away. The two of you have complex issues that need honest, open minded communication.", "ESH \nI don\u2019t think that you should ban her from seeing him altogether. But there should be consequences for her having somebody stay the night and not tell you guys about it. Like a lot of other posters have asked, why do you think she didn\u2019t tell you about it? Not him spending the night, but having an actual boyfriend. I would be more concerned that she brought somebody around her younger sibling that you had never met a knew nothing about. Also, how old is this person? Are they over 18? Or are they the same age? Kids are going to break rules and lie, and I think that needs to be addressed but I don\u2019t think that banning her from seeing him altogether is inappropriate punishment or enforceable. I do think it will encourage her to be more sneaky and lie more. I would require that you meet the boyfriend, that she has some kind of consequence for not telling you/lying. And try to figure out a better way for the two of you to communicate. In addition to this, if she didn\u2019t feel safe, being home alone with her younger sibling without having a \u201cmale figure\u201d there, then she\u2019s not somebody that you should leave in charge of her younger sibling. Also, I would make sure that she has contraceptives. I would thoroughly talk to her about sex because if he spending the night chances are they are totally having sex.", "NTA - this is parenting. Your roof, your rules. I don\u2019t think this was out of bounds for you to ban him and ground her. This is something that teenagers do, it\u2019s part of their development. The only question I have is: is there in your family a rule in place regarding sleepovers or friends coming over etc? From her reaction it sounds like there was an unwritten/unspoken rule. But it\u2019s a bit unfair to punish someone if she broke a rule that didn\u2019t even exist.\n\nDon\u2019t be too harsh on her, but make it clear that in the future this is something she should ask. \nWhether it\u2019s responsible to leave a 12yo alone for 2 days at home with only an older 17yo sibling, is a different discussion. But I think that depends on how mature they are.", "NTA, but these are normal teenage things.  She wanted to have sex. It's better off happening under your roof while you're away vs in a field or alleyway", "ESH. Idk why people are just giving her a free pass. She lied to you and gave a weak excuse (could be valid but she could have communicated with you). She asked for forgiveness not permission. So you\u2019re totally valid in punishing her. \n\nOn the other hand, Banning him completely is kinda far and you can\u2019t really control that. Shell probably still see him at school. So your an AH for that. \n\nI think grounding her and keeping her from going out with anyone for a couple weeks would be fair. Like no hanging out with friends or bfs but she\u2019ll still be able to see him at school. \n\nNow the other big questions are:\n- why didn\u2019t your daughter tell you he existed in the first place? Is it cause you\u2019ve been vocal about not letting her date in the past? If so your an AH. If not and she just wanted to be sneaky then nta.\n\n-did you make sure your daughter was comfortable with being alone and watched her sibling for 2 days?

What happens is she learns not to let you know whats going on in her life, because you will ruin it.", "After reading through the comments.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou need to find childcare for your 12 year old that isn't solely relying on your 17 year old.\n\nYou need to sit down with you 17 year old and talk.

You need to talk with her about relationships, sex, boundaries, consent, etc. etc.\n\nThen you need to do the same thing with your 12 year old.\n\nThen you need to really reassess your own parenting.", "YTA. Parenting's not for you.  Try something else.", "NTA. You love your girl and she messed up. But OP I am a woman and I\u2019d like to say I had issues with my dad at that age. They continued well into adulthood. Keep the car keys for now but take a breath and just talk to her. Please. Don\u2019t let other men seem like the ones to run to and her home base. Be a good father by talking to her like the young adult she is becoming. Make her want to hug you and say she\u2019s sorry by the end of the talk. \n\nOne of the only guys I don\u2019t regret sleeping with in my younger days was a guy that I was with around that age. My dad stopped me from seeing him because \u201cwe just spent too much time together\u201d (and I think he knew what was up). \n\nI am still friends with that guy to this day and I\u2019m in my 30s. Whether you like it or not, she\u2019s not a little girl anymore. I would absolutely stress the fact that she didn\u2019t tell you about him and also that you can\u2019t have young men that you don\u2019t know in your house/private property like that. Tell her that you trust her to be one of the family and to be honest and to protect the family and the house. Strengthen the family bond instead of straining it.\n\nTell her that if anything happened to her, and you didn\u2019t even know who she was with, that it would break your heart. Tell her you know she\u2019s growing up but you\u2019d like to help her avoid the big mistakes that can happen to some people during this transitional time of her life.\n\nEven if you are punishing her, please don\u2019t make it feel to her like it\u2019s because she is attracted to this boy or because she is growing up. Make it because you need to know that she\u2019s safe and value honesty and integrity, and so you are disappointed that she kept him from you. Say you\u2019re upset because you have to be able to trust her with your house and your things, and as a family you all are supposed to work together to protect that. \n\nI know she\u2019s your little girl. She is growing up though and I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a pivotal time for her individuation and development and you want her thinking daddy is home, safe, and loves me. She shouldn\u2019t start subconsciously feeling guilty about growing up and she should say to herself that she doesn\u2019t like the feeling when she around is men who aren\u2019t as safe and loving as her father. If you get too punishment driven, she will only see other guys as a refuge away from you and that\u2019s trouble, believe me. You\u2019re a good father. I\u2019m sorry she had someone in the house without telling you. I\u2019m sure she should have some kind of punishment. But please consider my words along with whatever else advice you got here and talk to her, and try not to be too harsh.", "NTA, your daughter didn't ask for permission because she knew you would not say yes which translate to \"I know I should not do this but I gone and did it anyways because no one will find out.\" This is a terrible trait for a person to have.
