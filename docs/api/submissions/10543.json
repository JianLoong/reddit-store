You probably don't realize there are alternatives, as the kid I'm not putting this on you.  Your parents should have explored other options earlier since this is an ongoing issue\n\nMoving forward though, you are at an age where you need to start taking the reigns on your health and finding what works for you to navigate your issues.

Them checking on your toothbrush is just them trying to make sure you brush. They shouldn't be threatening you with paying for your dental bill (I'd assume they aren't serious, but who knows), but they are obviously frustrated with you not brushing. To be fair, dental bills can be incredibly expensive if you don't take care of your teeth. The dentist and your parents are not going to just let you rot your teeth out of your head, so you will be dealing with fillings and cleanings until you leave the house.\n\nYou need to understand that losing your teeth can seriously impact your quality of life.  You're 15, you do not have the perspective to know how bad losing your teeth can be. You have decades of life ahead of you and living them without teeth will be much worse for you overall. It will impact your health and it will impact how you live your life.\n\nYou say you feel froggy in your throat? Are you swallowing any of the toothpaste? Because you shouldn't do that. You also should only use a very small amount on the brush, like a pea sized amount. The pic they put on the commercial is like 10x too much. Personally, I recommend using a Sonicare brush because it's effective and relatively quick for brushing, but it really depends on whether the vibration from it bothers you.\n\nYou need to seriously work on this and discuss different options with your parents for helping you brush, whether that is a different brush or toothpaste or whatever, because whatever money they spend in that regard will save them a lot down the line. And if worse comes to worse you really have to brush regardless of how it bothers you, because it's the lesser of two evils by far!\n\nYou also need to floss once a day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The younger you are when you get them, the faster you will lose the bone needed to support them. I have seen several people in their 60s and early 70s looking to get new dentures who have no bone, especially on the lower, to support them. They are termed dental cripples, because no adequate functional denture can be made at that point. There are lots of different tooth cleaning options, including those silicone full mouth ones. There are lots of toothpastes. I suggest a gel style children's tooth paste as they typically have good flavors and no abrasives that might give you a wierd feeling. I also recommend a water pik or water flosser. Also, easiest of all, chew a sugarless gum like trident extra care. Something with xylitol and possibly recaldent. Chew a piece of gum after every snack, meal and drink with sugar in it. Try to eliminate sugar, and simple carbs. A slice of soft white bread is often worse that outright candy as far as cavities are concerned. Look up low cariogenic diet and see what you can do. There are many many things you can do. Doing nothing would not be an option for me. If you have sensory issues they will most likely be made infinitely worse by dentures and the food restrictions that come with dentures. Tell your dentist (hopefully a pediatric dentist) about your struggles. They can make good recommendations as well. Plan on staying with a pediatric dentist well into adulthood due to your behavioral challenges. When/if they tell you to transition to a non pediatric dentist make sure you find one that specializes in special needs patients. They will be able to better care for you. Usually they care for patients who physically cannot care for themselves, but the result of someone who will not care for themselves is not that different, so they should be able to help. Since your physical appearance probably isn't a huge concern, they may be able to protect your teeth and help you keep them as long as possible with some Lowe cost options like stainless steel crowns, and silver diamond fluoride.

A wisdom tooth that was impacted that grew in in an awkward spot after 2 molars were pulled on my bottom side, and recently having to have that pulled because it was in an awkward spot, it just collected germs and got a hole in it. You are looking at many years of pain, there is no pain more debilitating than tooth pain, lots of payments out of pocket if you're in the US, most dental insurance is terrible, has very low annual caps and for the most part not worth much. It didn't help that I had 2 teeth break around the recession of 2008, so I had to deal with it, because it took me awhile to afford to have it fixed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think the sensory issues of brushing your teeth are bad, wait til you have dentists pushing with a metal tool on your tooth side to side to break it from the bone of your jaw and yank it out with forceps. Wait til you feel and hear bone cracking and breaking while they're fiddling around in there. Then, once they pull the tooth, that side will be tender for weeks, maybe a couple months. You will also likely have a few bone fragments over the next few months that will work their way out through the gums making you sore the whole time its slowly working its way out. And btw, one of the times I had a tooth pulled it was a \"hot infection\" meaning the numbing didn't work, the infection ate it up. An infected broken tooth that already hurts and them stabbing needles constantly into the surrounding nerve. Its excruciating, they finally had to give up and put me under general anesthesia which cost almost 1000 dollars and this was 15 years ago, I'm sure its more now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this is your choice, thats why I say NTA, all I can offer you is at 37, I wish I had listened to my grandmother about taking better care of my teeth when I was a kid. She was very big on that and I didn't listen. I'm in mild irritating pain right now because I've got a big ol bone fragment working its way slowly out of the recently extracted wisdom tooth.

Periodontitis has been linked to heart disease if memory serves.\n\nIdk what you have - all the best with the mental health care. All I can tell you is regardless what you do/don\u2019t have, you need healthy coping mechanisms in life. You can\u2019t just not brush your teeth, you need to use the time to find what works for you. Glad you\u2019re looking at alternatives. \n\nWhere I come from there\u2019s a plant branch that\u2019s used for brushing teeth traditionally, it\u2019s way more bristly though lol. Keep looking, you really never know what ends up helping you most.\n\nElectric brushes, I found Phillips are way gentle, oral B are harsher (look at the rotations per min etc.), overall they\u2019re way gentler than manually brushing fyi imho. Not sure what options there are for the heads\u2026also compare brands.", "YTA, to yourself. \n\nFellow ADHDer here, who fucking HATED brushing my teeth as a kid. My parents would have to check whether my brush was wet bc I would lie to get out of it. I now have permanent damage to my teeth at 26 and am discovering that dental fees are expensive as hell. \n\nYour aversion to brushing your teeth is rational based on your experiences and a valid emotional response, but that doesn't make \"not brushing\" a safe or healthy choice. Dental hygiene is essential to your overall wellbeing, and neglecting it can have devastating consequences. Dentures or veneers in the future are not a real alternative to protecting the teeth you already have in your mouth. \n\nHowever, your father and stepmother are not doing their job to instill healthy self-care behaviors in you. Guilt-tripping you about money, not believing your experiences with neurodivergence, and calling you lazy is not good parenting. I'm sorry that they aren't supporting you and taking care of you in the ways you need and deserve. \n\nAlternatives to a bristle toothbrush are a great place to start. I'd also suggest asking at your next dentist appointment about the science behind dental hygiene; I know my aversion to brushing my teeth got better when I understood why flossing matters and what fluoride does. I hope that your parents can get on board and help you find a way to keep up with your dental hygiene that actually works for you, but I encourage you to take ownership of this search rather than wait for them to understand. \n\nYou seem like a great young man who's working really hard to navigate a world that wasn't made for you, with very little support. I'm confident you'll be able to find a solution for this specific problem, and I hope in time you can build a support network that treats you with kindness and understanding.", "I have a lot of sympathy for this because I suffer the same sort of sensory issues and went uh.... too long without brushing my teeth for a few years. I'm going to say NAH because I can tell you're really struggling with this, but your parents are really right to be concerned about this problem. I don't think they're going about it the right way, necessarily, but I promise that a mouth full of dentures or cavities presents its own kind of sensory hell.\n\nAs a side note, my other advice as someone who's FINALLY built up a decent habit would be to try various types of brushes. I discovered that softer bristles help me, for instance-- hunt around for the different kinds of brush textures out there. Try them out until you find one that feels less actively terrible. I know you said you don't mind toothpaste really, but try some different types of that too. Some of them are \"grittier\" than others and feel worse during the brushing process. Look for types that say \"enamel protection\" or \"sensitive\" or stuff like that, or give the gel kind a try. It helps me, personally, to have a podcast or music playing while I brush since it distracts me from the sensations too.\n\nI'll also say that I hated mouthwash for so long until a friend recommended dry mouth mouthwash, which is much smoother and less alcoholic than the standard, and wasn't nearly such an issue. I also love the long floss wands (I hated flossing just as much as brushing). Ideally you could find a dentist and also a therapist you trust to talk you through some options but I know those are sometimes in short supply.\n\nI also want to say... start small. Brushing once a day is better than no brushing at all. It's not the dentist recommended amount but really and truly, you're at a stage where you can settle for baby steps and hopefully work your way up gradually. I feel like a lot of the advice here is just \"start brushing\" without realizing that in some ways that feels like telling someone who's out of shape to just \"start running marathons.\" You definitely need to be better about this but you can ramp up slowly. Try to build a habit of brushing once a day for at least 30 days in a row without any skips, and then shoot for twice a day.\n\nI know a lot of this might seem overwhelming, but the point here is that brushing really is important. I know that you know it's important, but it's worth emphasizing the fact. The solution to these sensory issues isn't to STOP brushing though, but to hopefully find a system that feels a little less like you're uh... pulling teeth (sorry). I'm rooting for you!", "\u201cYoure paying the next dentil bill\u201d is absolute a fair threat (they shouldnt actually follow through with it, but i get where they\u2019re coming from), dental bills are SO fucking expensive.\n\nI come from a neglectful family where i was never made to brush my teeth growing up and am now dealing with the consequences of that on my own. Its not just \u2018ill have to get dentures\u2019, its going in every other month for a new filling, having your teeth regularly drilled into, having teeth pulled and having permanent gaps where they used to be, gum disease and just overall agony. Like i cannot begin to express to you how painful it all is. Brush your fucking teeth.\n\nFigure something out or start facing the fact that you\u2019ll have to deal with this feeling for the rest of your life because i assure you, one or two years from now you\u2019ll hate yourself for this.", "Sorry but YTA on this one. I\u2019m neurodivergent, I hate brushing. But I also hate paying super expensive dental treatments. Plus your heart and kidney health might be severely impacted by not brushing your teeth. Maybe set a timer so you know when to stop. I use an electric brush and it helps. Not always but it does. Good luck there.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH. You aren\u2019t an AH for having sensory issues, I have sensory issues too so I get it. However, not taking care of your teeth doesn\u2019t just mean getting dentures when you\u2019re older. Bad teeth can cause a ton of health problems and pain for you. If you can\u2019t brush daily, you need to find something you can do daily. I\u2019d try at least flossing and getting a fluoride rinse (not mouthwash- that can dry out your mouth and cause bigger problems). I\u2019m glad you talked to your step mom about it, hopefully she can help you figure something out.", "YTA. You hate brushing your teeth, cavities and pulling them out will be way less fun.", "This may sound utterly mad BUT, my son was the same when he was younger, so I made him a sponge tooth brush, he couldn't stand the bristles on ANY kind of brush, including hair. Then we agreed that he would 'sponge' his teeth twice a day but use a good mouthwash and floss 3 times a day, it worked!", "I have problems with brushes. The best thing I can recommend is too try different types until you find one you can handle. There are all types of hardness to try including toddler brushes. A toddler brush will normally be soft bristles and a smaller head so that may help. There are also brushes with round heads which may feel different. Don't give up on the search for what works. If it is the bristle maybe try a water pick. Your best option may be a dentist who can give you more information about other options.", "YTA slightly. I understand that it\u2019s a sensory thing, but you just have to do it. I also have ADHD and autism, and yeah seemingly simple tasks can be very difficult or uncomfortable for us, but we can\u2019t just completely abandon our hygiene. \n\nOnce a week is not enough, your teeth *will* be damaged. 3 times an day is a bit excessive, though, twice is pretty standard. I\u2019d suggest starting smaller and brushing once a day instead of once a week, maybe even once every other day to start and then build it up, but you\u2019ve just *got* to deal with the discomfort on this one for your own health.", "I read the edits and updates and read about you not wanting dentures but I just have some advice about having dentures or no teeth at all because I am a nurse and had some special patients with special teeth  \ud83d\ude05 let's say you loose your teeth without pulling the teeth or drilling and other unpleasant dentist stuff, then you would still have to keep care of your gums before and after inserting the dentures, because if not, your gums won't be healthy at all. I also know one guy who is in his 60s and has no teeth and can eat everything without dentures easily, but he mumbles as he speaks and has to take care of his gums. \nFor patients with gastric tubes or something like that or dying patients who aren't eating anymore we have so called polygone swabs, this is some kind of sponge on a stick for keeping the gums wet and wiping the teeth and gums. You can also kind of brush with this swab because it has a rough surface and is not soft like a kitchen sponge. Maybe to get over your sensory problems you can learn to brush with this first, and later switch to real brushes again, but please try to take care of your teeth and gums and learn how to get over this sensory problems, because not brushing your teeth can lead to worse Problems than just having no teeth! Infections in your mouth, pain, spreading infections, abscesses, ...  Maybe seek professional help or further advice from a dentist or some professionalist with sensory problems.", "YTA. Thats disgusting", "HI. I have a feeling that the reason your parents are bringing up the cost of dental bills is due to their total frustration with you refusing to brush your teeth. I'm sure they've told you why you need to brush your teeth and those real reasons got them nowhere. Out of concern for you, they are now looking for anyway possible to get you to take care of yourself. Guilt is the last option and I completely understand why they took this route.\n\nGet a waterpic. Won't solve everything but it's better than nothing.", "NTA. also autistic, i fully understand lying to avoid a sensory hell. some options that may help: brush teeth with lights off/dim, brush teeth sitting down, put on sensory music, use an ultra-soft toothbrush, use soft gum picks before brushing, and talk to a dentist and therapist about your specific needs.", "Okay I see the edits and glad OP is looking for alternatives BUT ONCE A WEEK HOW DO YOU STILL HAVE TEETH OP \n\nIs it not a sensory problem to have fuzzy teeth and a bad taste in your mouth all the time?", "YTA", "YTA - I have sensory issues as well and I could never go about my day without brushing my teeth!
