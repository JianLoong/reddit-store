You probably don't realize there are alternatives, as the kid I'm not putting this on you.  Your parents should have explored other options earlier since this is an ongoing issue\n\nMoving forward though, you are at an age where you need to start taking the reigns on your health and finding what works for you to navigate your issues.  You can speak with your doctor to find alternatives or see what they recommend.  Do you have a therapist? They might have ideas as well.  Basic hygiene is something you need to learn to navigate in life.  \nWith the newfound knowledge you have now, you would be the A H if you don't start making changes and stop lying.  \n\nI hope you find something that works for you.  Taking care of your teeth is actually very important to your overall health.", "I have ADHD, too. Try toothpaste without fluoride and with xylitol, it made a huge difference for me.

(I know that sounds scary). but the tongue is what makes your breath smell bad. scraping it feels good (to me) and it gets so much gunk off, no brushing required!\n\ndrinking lots of water when eating also helps rinse down food and reduce plaque. after eating/drinking anything (other than water) it takes 20 min for your spit to be neutralized. so try not to sip on something or snack all day. gift your mouth time to neutralize.\n\navoid sodas, coffee, lemons, high sugary items. \n\nthese are all ways to keep your teeth clean in addition to whatever brushing you can manage.

If you're with getting teach problems then you can deal with it, if you want people to know you as \"the guy with awful breath\" then fine.", "ESH\n\nI'm tempted to say N T A, because your parents should be helping you deal with this and you're a kid, but you're old enough to be here asking so you need to take some responsibility in all this.\n\nIf your parents aren't helping you deal with your sensory or other issues and disregarding your issues with brushing that's bad, because you really need to brush your teeth. Them checking on your toothbrush is just them trying to make sure you brush. They shouldn't be threatening you with paying for your dental bill (I'd assume they aren't serious, but who knows), but they are obviously frustrated with you not brushing. To be fair, dental bills can be incredibly expensive if you don't take care of your teeth. The dentist and your parents are not going to just let you rot your teeth out of your head, so you will be dealing with fillings and cleanings until you leave the house.\n\nYou need to understand that losing your teeth can seriously impact your quality of life.  You're 15, you do not have the perspective to know how bad losing your teeth can be. You have decades of life ahead of you and living them without teeth will be much worse for you overall. It will impact your health and it will impact how you live your life.\n\nYou say you feel froggy in your throat? Are you swallowing any of the toothpaste? Because you shouldn't do that. You also should only use a very small amount on the brush, like a pea sized amount. The pic they put on the commercial is like 10x too much. Personally, I recommend using a Sonicare brush because it's effective and relatively quick for brushing, but it really depends on whether the vibration from it bothers you.\n\nYou need to seriously work on this and discuss different options with your parents for helping you brush, whether that is a different brush or toothpaste or whatever, because whatever money they spend in that regard will save them a lot down the line. And if worse comes to worse you really have to brush regardless of how it bothers you, because it's the lesser of two evils by far!\n\nYou also need to floss once a day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The younger you are when you get them, the faster you will lose the bone needed to support them. I have seen several people in their 60s and early 70s looking to get new dentures who have no bone, especially on the lower, to support them. They are termed dental cripples, because no adequate functional denture can be made at that point. There are lots of different tooth cleaning options, including those silicone full mouth ones. There are lots of toothpastes. I suggest a gel style children's tooth paste as they typically have good flavors and no abrasives that might give you a wierd feeling. I also recommend a water pik or water flosser. Also, easiest of all, chew a sugarless gum like trident extra care. Something with xylitol and possibly recaldent. Chew a piece of gum after every snack, meal and drink with sugar in it. Try to eliminate sugar, and simple carbs. A slice of soft white bread is often worse that outright candy as far as cavities are concerned. Look up low cariogenic diet and see what you can do. There are many many things you can do. Doing nothing would not be an option for me. If you have sensory issues they will most likely be made infinitely worse by dentures and the food restrictions that come with dentures. Tell your dentist (hopefully a pediatric dentist) about your struggles. They can make good recommendations as well. Plan on staying with a pediatric dentist well into adulthood due to your behavioral challenges.

A wisdom tooth that was impacted that grew in in an awkward spot after 2 molars were pulled on my bottom side, and recently having to have that pulled because it was in an awkward spot, it just collected germs and got a hole in it. You are looking at many years of pain, there is no pain more debilitating than tooth pain, lots of payments out of pocket if you're in the US, most dental insurance is terrible, has very low annual caps and for the most part not worth much. It didn't help that I had 2 teeth break around the recession of 2008, so I had to deal with it, because it took me awhile to afford to have it fixed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think the sensory issues of brushing your teeth are bad, wait til you have dentists pushing with a metal tool on your tooth side to side to break it from the bone of your jaw and yank it out with forceps. Wait til you feel and hear bone cracking and breaking while they're fiddling around in there. Then, once they pull the tooth, that side will be tender for weeks, maybe a couple months. You will also likely have a few bone fragments over the next few months that will work their way out through the gums making you sore the whole time its slowly working its way out. And btw, one of the times I had a tooth pulled it was a \"hot infection\" meaning the numbing didn't work, the infection ate it up. An infected broken tooth that already hurts and them stabbing needles constantly into the surrounding nerve. Its excruciating, they finally had to give up and put me under general anesthesia which cost almost 1000 dollars and this was 15 years ago, I'm sure its more now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this is your choice, thats why I say NTA, all I can offer you is at 37, I wish I had listened to my grandmother about taking better care of my teeth when I was a kid. She was very big on that and I didn't listen. I'm in mild irritating pain right now because I've got a big ol bone fragment working its way slowly out of the recently extracted wisdom tooth.

Kids can be cruel, and you may forever be known as the kid with bad breath \u2014 even if/when you change your behavior.\n\nAlso, once a week is practically doing nothing for your dental health. Plaque hardens within 24 hours, and part of the reason why a minimum of twice daily is recommended is in case you miss some (and eating, etc.). Also, don\u2019t forget to floss once a day. I love my waterpic, and I actually really love doing it in the shower so it doesn\u2019t make a mess. What actually matters most is what happens under the gum line, and mouthwash will help, too.\n\nHow often do your parents take you to the dentist? Something tells me \u201cnot often enough\u201d if you haven\u2019t had \u201cthe talk\u201d with dentists. You should go every 6 months or so.\n\nOne thing to consider is to brush your teeth in the shower. Also, find a flavor of toothpaste you like. Maybe thing of it like a game or challenge. There are even powders and tablets like those at the store Lush. You can even make your own. I think I went through a coconut oil phase about a decade ago. The mechanical action is more important than the paste. For mouthwash, you probably want alcohol free.", "I work for a dentist and can confirm, we see many people who spend so much time and money on getting dentures and adjusting them, only to give up on them because they just cannot get used to how they feel. And even if you are OK with the feel of wearing dentures, you still will need to brush your mouth clean daily! That's not even going to the hassles of cleaning the dentures themselves, learning how to eat and talk while wearing them, avoiding foods that you cannot chew with them in, worrying about slippage, having them regularly adjusted and replaced... And improperly fitting dentures can cause pain, sores, even eventual bone loss.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE do not just assume losing your teeth and getting dentures in the future will solve your problems here. It will only make things worse.", "This. OP, if you don't like brushing your teeth, how are you okay with the dentist drilling into your teeth? How are you okay with root canals? All of that is in your future, if it isn't already happening.\n\nWith that said, a simple search on Amazon provided toothbrushes for people with autism and sensory issues. This was one that looked good. Maybe go that route instead: [https://www.amazon.com/bA1-Health-Specialty-Toothbrush-Sensitive/dp/B06XFMHR81/](https://www.amazon.com/bA1-Health-Specialty-Toothbrush-Sensitive/dp/B06XFMHR81/)\n\nYou have autism.

Heart health is closely linked to dental health. Plus I have family who went through full extractions and it's very painful, from what I understand. \n\nESH for the reasons you stated, but OP needs to do some research for themselves on hacks for neurodivergent self-care. This is not a problem that I have, but it is not uncommon in the ND communities I'm a part of. This is not an all or nothing situation and op needs to find some solutions or ask the parents to help them find some, rather than lying.\n\nEta: I saw after that you said you do use mouthwash. Good, that's a start! Keep looking for more solutions. You're a minor though and your parents have to make you brush your teeth. It's for your health.", "I plant my feet firmly behind this response. And would add that you should find some adults who can help you, and also make sure other adults know they\u2019re helping you as a general precaution. Team ADHD yo!", "This isn\u2019t an advice sub. It\u2019s a judgement sub", "Right! This is a disabled minor struggling with help problems his negligent parents are not properly handling. Please Google toothbrushing alternatives for neurodivergent people for help. If they're trying to make you lay for your next dental work anyway, it'll be cheaper for you to use a few dollars on finding something like a silicon finger brush and unflavored toothpaste. Even scrubbing at your teeth with a finger wet with salt water is better than nothing, keep flossing and using fluoridated mouthwash, and stay away from charcoal toothpaste. Good luck! There's good alternatives that might work, just keep trying!", "Once a week? Yuck. You should be doing it once a day at a minimum.", "I'm autistic, I get it. Toothbrushes are a sensory nightmare. But if you hate the sensation of brushing you're teeth then you're *really* gonna hate the sensations that come with losing your teeth. \n\nBrushing three times a day is what the dentist recommends, but anything is an improvement right now. You can get chewable tooth paste, swish with mouthwash, and/or get a water pick to make up that gap while you work up to brushing more regularly. \n\nThis is something a therapist can help with even if you don't have an autism diagnosis. For example, many people with depression struggle with hygiene too. Therapists will not be surprised to hear about this issue and they can help.", "Once a week is not enough.\n\nYou should settle for atleast once a day, better twice.\n\nI know nobody who does it three times a day, definitely not necessary.", "Have you tried brushing without toothpaste? It's mostly the mechanical action that gets your teeth clean.  If it's the brush that bothers you, there are other things that are spongelike (mainly used for someone who has to have their teeth brushed by others.\n\nBut please take care of your teeth. Coming from a Boomer who has a mouthful of fillings and crowns, most damage was already in place by your age.", "We have evidence of human tooth cleaning from as early as 3500 BCE. Let that sink in. Tooth brushing is so critical to human health and the connection between the two so obvious that humans have been brushing their teeth for more than five thousand years. \n\n\n\nBrushing your teeth is super important. Not just because your real teeth are better than implants (which are bankrupting and no insurance covers them) or dentures, but also because mouth infections can literally kill you. It\u2019s not such a far way for an infection to travel from a gum or sinus right up to your brain. \n\n\n\nYou gotta figure out a way to take real care of your teeth. Which means actively removing plaque from the fronts, backs, and sides of your teeth and your gum lines. And while floss takes care of the sides, mouth wash doesn\u2019t do much of anything to remove plaque. Getting a good scrub on your teeth is something you need to figure out how to do and cope with.\n\n\n\nSigned, a person who really REALLY hates the brushy sound a tooth brush makes, but still brushes my teeth twice a day, every day for at least a minute and a half each time.", "One thing that helps me and a lot of adhd people is keeping a toothbrush and toothpaste in the shower, and brushing when you take a shower. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by frogginess, but it helps with a lot of the sensory stuff, and also just forgetfulness for me. Really, check any of the adhd subs and there are tons of suggestions for brushing your teeth. Figure out what works for you, but it really does have to be done daily.

That hole still feels so weird in my mouth two years later. Getting an implant and a crown is expensive several thousand dollars a piece. Multiply that by multiple missing teeth that adds up real quick. A lot of US dental practices do not offer payment plans so you pay that upfront if your insurance won\u2019t cover anything.", "Do these work?\n\nI always gag when I brush my teeth, particularly the back teeth and the insides. I\u2019ve wanted something I could just stick in my mouth.", "Bless Crest bubblegum flavored toothpaste. Why the fuck do they make the mint so strong in that shit?

At that point I gave up and went back to kids toothpaste because I refuse to hurt myself if I don't have to.", "That\u2019s good, and well done for posting about it.  I kind of had the opposite problem to you, my parents were neglectful and abusive and didn\u2019t teach me about hygiene or oral hygiene, so when I was young I didn\u2019t brush my teeth because I didn\u2019t know any better.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cI\u2019ll just get dentures\u201d when I\u2019m older.
