Just tell your friend what is good for you and what isn't. It's not going to kill anything.\n\nYou'd be a bit childish if you couldn't put up with her at a bar or a party.

Don't travel with anyone you don't want to.

You can find other travel companions who aren't dicks.", "NTA.  She made you mildly unhappy through the whole trip.  That is tiring.  She can grow up on someone else's time.

But that doesn\u2019t mean that you need to be around it. I would just broach the topic sooner rather than later so it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re springing it on him last minute. Just let him know you\u2019re down to plan a trip with just the 2 of you but her attitude- even if it\u2019s rooted in immaturity- made the last trip less enjoyable for you and just isn\u2019t something you choose to be around.", "Most 19 year olds don't act like such unpleasant pests. And loudly accusing you of being racist in the middle of a public place was not only stupid but also could've caused problems for you.\n\nSince he seems to know what she did, I'd tell him that you cannot travel again with her. But as others have said, do it sooner than later", "Tell him you would like to go on another trip with him, but not his roommate. \n\nIt is not your job to enable her to mature. You aren\u2019t her mama or teacher, you don\u2019t have to put up with her.\n\nIf he says, \u201cno\u201d, then you should find more agreeable and mature travel companions.

Are you sure your friend doesn't have unrequited romantic feelings for her and is making excuses. \n\nOne wonderful thing about friends and acquaintances is that you actually don't have to be around people who you don't like and are annoying. Of course everyone will be slightly annoying some of the time but it seems like you don't really like the girl plus she is annoying - so she is really just a friend of a friend.\n\nI would just be honest with your friend in terms of future trips. Tell him that you don't want to spend extended periods of time with the girl on what are supposed to be relaxing trips.
