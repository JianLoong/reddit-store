All you did was tell the truth.  If the truth was \"humiliating\" to her, then she only has herself to blame for her failure to get you a gift.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed she should have gotten you a gift.", "NTA - She embarrassed herself by being so selfish that she accepted a gift from her husband but once again refused to GET him one.\n\nNext time she says something, tell her calmly that if she is embarrassed then she should consider changing her behavior.\n\nI would also stop buying her anything. Seriously, stop. Dont reward her with consideration when she ignores you repeatedly, it's enabling her to continue.\n\nWhen she asks where her gift is, tell her you took a page out of her book and bought yourself something instead. Show off the new cologne, new watch, new iPad, ticket away for the weekend, etc whatever you got yourself.\n\nWhen she is ready to act like she is half of a partnership, and do a few therapy sessions to fix what she broke, then you can both consider what works for you as a couple. Until that point, she can fend for herself. No rewards, gifts, treats, extra of any type.", "NTA. In most situations (though there are some exceptions) I think it's very important not to lie, even if someone tells you to. If she wanted you to say she got you a gift, she could have just... gotten you a gift. You also turned it into a joke and the family laughed about it before moving on. That doesn't seem humiliating, that just seems like a light-humoured joke about a circumstance. If you aren't upset that you didn't get a gift, then it is fine for her not to get you one. But she shouldn't expect you to lie and say she did then.", "NTA - you made light of it rather than being a dick about it so kudos to you. I'm sure everyone had a good laugh at the time and no one thought about it for more than a hot minute.", "You are NTA.  Time for a conversation about what\u2019s going on with her.", "INFO: This is all a bit odd.\n\nWhen she asked you not to mention not getting a gift, she didn't say *why* she didn't get you a gift? Did she not say anything on Christmas about the reason for no gift??\n\nIf she was embarrassed, she could have explained her reason to her friends and coworkers.\n\nIt just seems quite strange that she's been entirely mum about it, so what *has* she said?", "NTA I sometimes forget to get my husband a Christmas present because I\u2019m busy trying to get stuff for the kids and the nieces and nephews. So as a joke if I forget to get his present, I just put coal for me and him from Santa. Then have his gift sent after Christmas. \ud83d\ude05", "NTA you already warned her you weren't going to lie and she's had nearly a month to make it not a lie.", "NTA.\nIf she was so worried about appearances she had several other option other than asking you to lie - give you the gift after the party you hosted, made you something heartfelt or written out a really nice love letter/card, actually talked to you before Christmas about why she couldn't swing the money or time for a gift just yet. \nYou didn't nag her about the oversight or even bring it up yourself, however she was quick to be flashy for the attention. \nSounds like your wife knew what the consequences would be and how she would be looked at and didn't care enough to mitigate the situation.", "NTA. You were asked, you didn't volunteer. Why should you lie and explain an imaginary gift from her? The way you played it off, you made it light, they might not even believe you didn't get anything. You didn't let on that it bothered you or that she did anything bad. I would think you were just trying to be funny if I got that answer to be honest. If she is ashamed by the truth, then why hasn't she addressed it, and why is that your problem?\n\nIf this were me, I would tell her that if she wants me to lie, she needs to purchase whatever gift I make up in order to keep up appearances. Lol.\n\nFinally - ask her why she is ashamed that she didn't get you anything, which implies that she knows it is wrong, but still hasn't explained why she decided not to give you a gift. Was this her way of telling you something or what's up? You might want to find out.", "You didn't have to add the part about being on Santa's naughty list, but NTA for telling the truth.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH, personally. She shouldn\u2019t have asked you to lie, but the way you handled it was passive-aggressive and I think you probably knew the effect it would have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you help with selecting, getting, and wrapping gifts for the kids, or does your wife handle all that?", "My spouse insists on giving me Christmas gifts even though I ask her not to spend the money. For a spouse not to get their SO a gift at all, when finances don\u2019t appear to be an issue and there was no discussion about not spending money on gifts, is definitely sending a message. And then to ask you to lie about it as if they\u2019re suddenly embarrassed by their imitation of Scrooge? That\u2019s just wrong. NTA\n\nP.S. I suspect this was written by a wife.", "NTA!!\n\nOmg, I am so angry on your behalf! People who ask others to lie to cover for their shitty choices piss me off. And instead of just getting you something, or planning something special you two could do together (\"wifey has a secret, special day planned for us! I must've been on Santa's good list!\") she asked you to lose some integrity and lie to your friends and family.

Sounds like she has plenty of spending money and still wants to come looking like she bears gifts or something.\n\nIt's kind of a shitty attitude to have, but you did the best and made light of it.

I was just glad to have our kids opening gifts and her getting the watch she had been wanting for some time.\n\nThe moment lasted just that a moment, as soon as the laughing stopped I launched in \"what did you get the grandkids\" since most grandparents love spoiling the grandkids and talking about them.\n\nAll she said when asking me to lie was that she did not have time to go shopping for me.", "I agree with the majority of your comment, but the Feast of Epiphany is January 6.

She still hasn't offered a reason, despite being mad at you?\n\nNope cause I really do not care why. I do not care about not getting anything.

And than January 7th which was our get together.\n\nI am assuredly not going to keep digging a hole by asking why she did not buy anything when her first and only reason was she had no time.", "OK so she *did* say why in the first place, that's what I originally asked. \n\nIf there was some big difficult reason why she couldn't get you a gift I'd be more empathetic to her, but it's basically 'didn't bother' so she has no call to expect you to cover for that or to be mad that you were honest.", "Barely NTA.

Also does she usually buy you gifts for Christmas?\n\nWe mainly bought for the kids from amazon, so we sat down and did so together. I picked up the rest mainly at Walmart. Picked up her dad a watch he had hi ted at waning. If you mean moneywise I paid for those (including dad in law).\n\nShe did the shopping for her mom and an aunt.\n\nAt Christmas we have always exchanged gifts.
