The problem is that I need my office back and since the nursery isn\u2019t being used I asked to covert it back about a month ago. It didn\u2019t go well so we kept it there. She isn\u2019t going back to work now since she quit.\n\nThis makes the problem of the office even worse, before I could work on the kitchen table but I can not concentrate at all since she is always bothering me when working.

She would have been back to work by now if she don\u2019t quit and the baby would have been watched by mom at this time.\n\nI asked again to get my office back it didn\u2019t go well, she got in an argument and she thinks I am a horrible person.

Just a small yet meaningful reminder that you haven\u2019t forgotten her baby, which I think is part of what taking down the nursery represents to her.

There aren't a lot of single people who would take on a pregnant woman on short notice (which I'm guessing is what happened here) even if she was their sister.\n\nI suffered a couple of miscarriages, so I understand your sister's grief, which is only compounded by the ugly implosion of her marriage.  Quitting her job was actually the worst thing she could have done.  Yes, she certainly needed to take time off, but with no job to return to, she has no impetus to return to dealing with life.  I think she needs to see a grief counselor to help her work through the process.  Gently suggest she see someone to help her work through an overwhelming period in her life and help her get ready for surviving on her own post-divorce.  If you spin it as dealing with the divorce, she might be more willing to do it since it will give her a chance to vent about her (hopefully) soon-to-be-ex.  The counsellor will be wise enough to realize the loss of the child may be the bigger issue.\n\nIf you can afford it, perhaps suggest a compromise in the meantime.  Offer to rent a storage unit and store the baby items there.  Say you will pay three months of rental and give her the key to the storage unit.  She can visit it and cry as much as she needs to there.  She will still have the reminders of her baby while you will have your office back.  I know this isn't the healthiest long-term option, but until she can effectively deal with her grief, this may be the most expedient option.

I wanted to offer my thoughts from the perspective of a loss mom. All six of my babies were premature.

The other three were in NICU between 3 weeks and six months. And my husband left me when I was pregnant with our youngest who would eventually be born at 24 weeks and survive. I give you that background to let you, and her, if you choose to share my comment, know that I have an inkling of how truly awful her situation is. \n\nSit her down and have a gentle bit form conversation with her. Acknowledge you cannot possibly understand the depth of pain she is in right now and in a perfect would you would give her everything she needs. Tell her that you want to continue to support her through this brutally difficult time in life, but in order to do so you have to be able to work. To that end you need a quiet uninterrupted place to do that work. Then ask her if she has any thoughts on how the two of you can work together to make it happen. She may dig her heels in. She\u2019s probably lonely and part of why she\u2019s interrupting you is for the human contact. Her husband left her. Her mother\u2019s being insensitive. Her baby died. You\u2019re her last lifeline. But if the lifeboat sinks she\u2019s going to drown. You need to keep the lifeboat from sinking. If she doesn\u2019t offer a suitable alternative tell her you need to take the nursery down, but doing so doesn\u2019t mean her baby is forgotten. If baby has a name, use it. Come up with some memory box ideas for baby\u2019s things and offer to make them. Ask her what kind of display she might want to make? For years I had one of the bassinets filled and decorated with photos and clothes and toys. That might be an idea. Another idea is to set up a corner of her room as a miniature nursery to keep baby\u2019s memory alive. I think if you show her that you\u2019re not trying to forget baby existed she will be more willing to work with you.  If she\u2019s not, tell her you don\u2019t have a choice, take down the nursery and do a little memorial thing for her anyway. \n\nAnd lastly, she needs grief counseling. This is an awful thing to try to come to terms with. It won\u2019t be fast and it won\u2019t be pretty, but eventually we learn to live with our losses. Grief counseling helps get through the worst of it.", "You might look to see if there are any grief support groups in the area.", "OP needs a dedicated space to work so I think the options of Sis moves into nursery and he uses her room or she moves what she wants from nursery to her room and he gets his office back.", "Wait she's blaming your mother for her soon to be ex's affair.... was he walking around nude when your mother stuck out a foot to trip him and his p landed in his affair partner?

Help her with the legal divorce stuff. Help her create something to memorialize the baby. Be with her and listen to her when she wants to talk about things, or check if she wants to be distracted.

During this time, try to set some boundaries for when you return to work so that she knows not to bother you, but that you will be there for her when she needs it.\n\nI really think you need to lock the irritation you feel away in a corner of your mind and realize that sometimes supporting family that you love is not comfortable or easy.
