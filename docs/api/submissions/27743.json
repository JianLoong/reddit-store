Her husband cheated on her and kicked her out. They are in the middle of a very messy divorce and she was pregnant when that went down. We made a nursery out of my office for her.  \n\nShe gave birth about three months ago and the baby didn\u2019t make it. The problem is that I need my office back and since the nursery isn\u2019t being used I asked to covert it back about a month ago. It didn\u2019t go well so we kept it there. She isn\u2019t going back to work now since she quit.\n\nThis makes the problem of the office even worse, before I could work on the kitchen table but I can not concentrate at all since she is always bothering me when working. It\u2019s affecting my job. She would have been back to work by now if she don\u2019t quit and the baby would have been watched by mom at this time.\n\nI asked again to get my office back it didn\u2019t go well, she got in an argument and she thinks I am a horrible person.

It's tragic that your sister's baby did not survive but she can't hijack your house forever because of it.  If she had her own house then she could leave the nursery as is for however long she wants BUT she doesn't.  You were generous in allowing her to move in with you.  Now she's not working and taking up your space.  I'd have to tell her that I'm very sorry for her pain but you have to have your office space back. You're not asking her, you're telling her.", "Nta. Sister needs a therapist.", "NTA take your office back. Neither of you are going to have a roof over your head otherwise", "You did announce you needed to maximize the space a month ago, so NTA. I'm sorry for your sister's woes. Truly. But, you aren't being unkind in taking her in and supporting her while she is at this low point. Your sister isn't TA, either. Her life seems sad and chaotic. I'm sorry for her. You just can't accommodate her.", "NTA.\n\nI am very sympathetic to her situation, but not to her demands on how you use your own home after you have been so kind to let her stay. This was never her space, just space you were allowing her to use. \n\nI'm sure it's painful to her to see the world keep moving, but that's a pain she'll need to deal with. Pretending the world stopped is not a solution.", "More Info:  \nCan your sister stay with your mother instead?  If not, can your mother keep your sister occupied during your working hours?  Since your mother was going to watch the baby, I assume she has the time to do this.  I feel that you're NTA.  Even given your sister's heartbreaking situation, it's completely unreasonable for her to expect you to set aside an entire room in your house as a shrine.  If she needs some type of shrine, try setting one up in a corner of your sister's bedroom or the shared living space.", "NTA. This is terribly sad, but you need a place to work. Let her know you'll be converting the space back to an office by X date, that you know this is hard for her, and ask whether there are small items from the space she'd like for keepsakes before you empty it. If there is furniture, she likely won't agree to sell it, but she might be okay with donating it to someone in need. Basically, take the choice away from her, so it's not her feeling like she's being disloyal to the memory of her baby. You'll be the bad guy, but over time, hopefully she'll understand.", "NTA; It's your space and you want it back. It's a hard situation though. She's in mourning and that's the piece of her baby that still exist. I would help her find counselling if she hasn't yet.", "NTA you need your office & it is not her home.  Can you move the guest bed into the nursery & have her take over that room, making her room your office? Or move most of the nursery items into the room she is staying? You were too generous giving up your office to begin with. She needs grief counseling & I would tell her it has to be a condition of her staying with you. You can acknowledge her loss & at the same time acknowledging the current arrangement isn\u2019t working for you.", "NTA", "NTA- it\u2019s your house. \n\nPut everything that\u2019s in the nursery in a storage, do not throw anything away.", "NAH. This is your house, and this is your space, and it's unused. You are right to retake it. \n\nBut I don't blame your sister for being upset. Loosing a baby must be horrible, and seing the room being repurposed probably really makes the reality even more tangible for her.", "NTA, if you lose your job, you will all be homeless.", "NTA", "NTA it's YOUR home and since there's no baby, it's YOUR office again. If she doesn't like it she can move out", "INFO: What was your plan for a workspace if the baby had survived? Your office would still have been a nursery even with the baby over at your mother's during the day. What was the original timeline of her living with you?", "NTA  How long ago did baby die?  Its your place to do with as you wish but may be time to tell her to get a job and get out! But then, I'm not that compassionate!", "NTA your sister is grieving and for that she needs therapy but you also need work space. I would start with the compromise that you can work in the nursery or she can be out of the house while you work. You need space and quiet to do your job and she's going to have to give a little somewhere.", "NTA that would be your sister thinking she is entitled to space in your home.  You need to tell her your house, your house, and your rules.  Otherwise, she needs different living arrangements.  \n\nIf she wants to argue, she needs to be on the lease and pay rent.  She isn't she is a guest, she can leave.", "NTA. You\u2019re supporting her. She needs to stop making that harder. And I wouldn\u2019t let her live there forever.

This is a tough situation.", "NAH\n\nThis is an awful situation, and your sister probably views the nursery as the last remaining bit of her lost child.  At the same time, it's understandable you need your office back.\n\nIt sounds like your sister very much needs counseling to help her deal with her loss.", "NAH\n\nHer loss is still very fresh and she is grieving the baby that should be using that room. You also need to be able to work. If she doesn't stop interrupting you at your job, the best option is the office.", "NTA if she gives you shit throw her ass out she can live with your mommy it\u2019s your residence she isn\u2019t working or contributing to your house hold she can get over herself", "NTA but maybe have a big family sit down so she has emotional support from other family members while she feels your twisting the knife. She went through something no parent should have to. The nursery is like a shrine to her right now. Putting it back as office is forcing her to her to deal with what happened. It's not wrong to want to reverse it back", "NAH\n\nYour job is paying the bills, so it has to be the top priority. \n\nHave you considered gathering some of the decorations/items in the room and put together a shadow box or something for her? I imagine that part of your sister's reluctance might be due to the fact that removing the nursery feels like pretending the baby never existed. Perhaps putting together some keepsakes for her, showing that the baby does matter and hasn't been erased, would soften the blow of taking down the nursery.", "NAH\n\nAs someone who has lost a child, it\u2019s part of the grieving process not wanting to touch or move the nursery. Have you spoken to her about starting to sort through the things in the nursery together. \nOr just starting a bit at a time as that\u2019s part of the process, as hopefully that will clear the room. And help her grieve and process what\u2019s happened\n\nPart of the issue is that just saying that you need the room could spiral her mental state but I totally understand needing the room back for work, see if you could get her down to a corner for a little shrine. \n\nI wanted everything cleared and put away as soon as possible but I know people that haven\u2019t touched the nursery for over a year", "NAH but i think for my sisters benefit I\u2019d give her some time to process this. I can imagine what\u2019s she\u2019s going thru and to see the nursery taken down is like the rest of the nails in her baby\u2019s coffin. \n\nIt also might be helpful for her to help take the nursery down. I hope she\u2019s in therapy. That\u2019s just rough.", "NTA is it possible to just move the nursery around and put your desk back in the room also?", "I understand your reasoning but I think this change is something that has to be decided by your sister for her mental health.  That nursery is all she has left of her baby right now.  It's only been three months.  Please give her a little grace and a bit more time to work through her feelings.\n\nYou do have to be clear with her about leaving you alone while you work however in the meantime.   \n\nAlso suggest grief counseling and support groups either in person or online.  There are a lot of great communities out there.  \n\nNAH", "YWBTA Losing a child is no small matter, and then to have her safe space ripped away so you can have your office? Toughen up and find another solution for work. She\u2019s already in a fragile state dealing with divorce and loss.
