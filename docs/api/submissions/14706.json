When my eldest sister (35f) got engaged at 24 she asked me to design her dress since I'm passionate about design and she always loved my style. Her dress was a knock out, everyone loved it and ever since when ever one of our relatives announces their engagement they ask if I can design their dress for them. I've always said yes because I absolutely love doing it just so much fun. \n\nOn to the issue, my cousin (23f) is getting married next February and called me up to see when we could meet so she could share her ideas for her dress and I can start designing it. I do not like this cousin at all, her parents spoiled her beyond rotten. I decided to still meet with her though and see if anything has changed since she's now an adult. She immediately shows me some photos of wedding dresses by Sara Burton and tells me she wants something exactly like the pictures, I try to suggest a change in neckline or color and she shuts it down and tell me she wants exactly that. I told her I would not be making her dress as I love designing clothes that embody their wearer and suit them, not rip off others designers so she can look fancy in a knock off.\n\nSome of my family and especially her and her parents are beyond upset and have been blowing up my phone because I've \"broken tradition and my baby cousins heart because she's been looking forward to having me make her wedding dress for years now\"\n\nI feel kind of bad but at the same time she's taking the fun and bonding out of designing a wedding dress.", "created_utc": 1681406847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kwkp5/aita_for_not_designing_my_cousins_wedding_dress/", "score": 989, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When she presented it to the customer they suggested some rather large edits. So my friend took the painting back and made the changes requested. When she presented the painting a second time the customer again asked for edits. My friend declined and said they could either take the painting as was, or she would return their deposit. \n\nShe told me, when people hire her to paint for them, they have chosen her as an artist because they enjoy sharing her vision as an artist.

I'm not sure what she is asking for.\n\nThis is so simple, it doesn't require any meetings, confabs, or anything (including not even one minute of your time or talent).

First off, YOU are the one who started the tradition and it\u2019s up to you whether you wish to carry on the tradition or not. Next, the tradition was that you help DESIGN a dress, and cousins did not wish to have a dress designed she already had her vision in mind and simply wanted a seamstress. Being a seamstress is neither your passion nor what the tradition actually is. The tradition is not you sewing the dress, it is you designing the dress with the bride\u2019s input. Logically speaking, like other posters have pointed out, your cousins is in fact the one breaking the tradition because she\u2019s not asking for a dress design, she already has her vision and wants her vision made for her.\nPersonally, like someone also pointed out, I feel like it\u2019s ok to point out to other family members that everyone else in the family has a considerably different attitude in general regarding OPs help with the dress designing. It seems everyone else asked and the cousin acted like it was a done deal. That\u2019s kinda not cool and I feel like people should be informed when their behavior is problematic. Entitled people get away with their behavior because it works for them. Notice that her parents aren\u2019t saying anything about her missing out on the bonding part of the experience, she\u2019s just upset you\u2019re not making her dress.

You can't copyright a specific design element so you can't really copyright a combination of specific design elements.\n\nPlagiarism in fashion is tricky and copyright law traditionally hasn't protected fashion designs since it's pretty impossible to prove that someone stole a design.
