When my eldest sister (35f) got engaged at 24 she asked me to design her dress since I'm passionate about design and she always loved my style. Her dress was a knock out, everyone loved it and ever since when ever one of our relatives announces their engagement they ask if I can design their dress for them. I've always said yes because I absolutely love doing it just so much fun. \n\nOn to the issue, my cousin (23f) is getting married next February and called me up to see when we could meet so she could share her ideas for her dress and I can start designing it. I do not like this cousin at all, her parents spoiled her beyond rotten. I decided to still meet with her though and see if anything has changed since she's now an adult. She immediately shows me some photos of wedding dresses by Sara Burton and tells me she wants something exactly like the pictures, I try to suggest a change in neckline or color and she shuts it down and tell me she wants exactly that. I told her I would not be making her dress as I love designing clothes that embody their wearer and suit them, not rip off others designers so she can look fancy in a knock off.\n\nSome of my family and especially her and her parents are beyond upset and have been blowing up my phone because I've \"broken tradition and my baby cousins heart because she's been looking forward to having me make her wedding dress for years now\"\n\nI feel kind of bad but at the same time she's taking the fun and bonding out of designing a wedding dress.", "created_utc": 1681406847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kwkp5/aita_for_not_designing_my_cousins_wedding_dress/", "score": 243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants to get with me and we can come up with something unique and custom for her,  I'd be happy to.\"", "NTA. Thank you for not knocking off someone else\u2019s design.

Stick to your boundary here.", "NTA. You wouldn't be designing a dress for her. Like you said it's a knock off/copy. I wouldn't do that even if I liked her. No pleasure in a copying someone else's work.", "NTA... you generously donated your time to design these dresses, originals for the brides. That was you being generous, not a \"tradition,\" and you're under no obligation to design for anybody.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to decline a request to design a dress for someone, especially if it goes against your values as a designer. \n\nIt's unfair for your family to pressure you into designing something that doesn't align with your artistic vision.

Your cousin values neither of those things. \n\nYour family's arguments about tradition are bullshit - you've offered original designs in consultations with the brides in the past, not copies of others' works. \n\nNTA, and keep your boundary.

It makes no sense for her to have been looking forward to you designing a dress if she's literally telling you to use someone else's design.

It's understandable that you want to design a dress that represents your client and not just copy someone else's design. It's also not fair to pressure you to design something that doesn't align with your principles or artistic vision. You should not feel guilty for refusing a client who wants to rip off another designer's work. Your cousin should respect your decision and understand that she cannot force you to design something that you're not comfortable with.", "NTA\n\nThe agreement is that you design a dress, not copy another designer & the bride gets a free dress.

Remind the family that if they really want her to have the designer dress she wants (I know nothing about them, but I assume the one she showed you is super expensive, and having you recreated was save a lot of money) they can all chip in money to help her buy it and have it altered.", "NTA. Inform your family that the reason you declined to design her a dress us because she doesn't want you to. She wants you to make her one she's already seen, for free.", "NTA she just a brat", "NTA.

Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA - it's not a \"tradition\", it's one person in the family who happens to be great at designing and making dresses, volunteering time and effort (and probably a lot of both and more). You're free to absolutely not do that, and anyone saying you must or otherwise should is objectively wrong.

However, your reasons are... sus.  You don't want to do her dress, and that's fine.

You wanted an excuse to shut her down.  \n\nThat makes YTA.\n\nNot because you won't do her dress.
