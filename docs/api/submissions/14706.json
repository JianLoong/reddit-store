When my eldest sister (35f) got engaged at 24 she asked me to design her dress since I'm passionate about design and she always loved my style. Her dress was a knock out, everyone loved it and ever since when ever one of our relatives announces their engagement they ask if I can design their dress for them. I've always said yes because I absolutely love doing it just so much fun. \n\nOn to the issue, my cousin (23f) is getting married next February and called me up to see when we could meet so she could share her ideas for her dress and I can start designing it. I do not like this cousin at all, her parents spoiled her beyond rotten. I decided to still meet with her though and see if anything has changed since she's now an adult. She immediately shows me some photos of wedding dresses by Sara Burton and tells me she wants something exactly like the pictures, I try to suggest a change in neckline or color and she shuts it down and tell me she wants exactly that. I told her I would not be making her dress as I love designing clothes that embody their wearer and suit them, not rip off others designers so she can look fancy in a knock off.\n\nSome of my family and especially her and her parents are beyond upset and have been blowing up my phone because I've \"broken tradition and my baby cousins heart because she's been looking forward to having me make her wedding dress for years now\"\n\nI feel kind of bad but at the same time she's taking the fun and bonding out of designing a wedding dress.", "created_utc": 1681406847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kwkp5/aita_for_not_designing_my_cousins_wedding_dress/", "score": 4772, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
