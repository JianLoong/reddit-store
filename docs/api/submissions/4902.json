Yesterday he came home from school upset, kid just had a bad day he was getting bullied, he got yelled at a few times and he has this nasty cold right now so everything just feels x10 worse for him.\n\nI decided to try and cheer him up by taking him out with me for the night. We did everything we went to a restaurant, I took him shopping and bought him anything he wanted, all of that. We went to the park that night and just talked about life, it was really fun. We ended up coming back home at 3 AM. This is where the problem starts.\n\nHis mom was PISSED at me. Told me he was too young to be out that late and that I shouldn't be taking him out while he's sick. I tried to defend myself saying it was only to cheer him up and that he was completely fine but she was having none of it. Told me I was irresponsible and that I \"put the kid's life in danger\".\n\nI personally find this whole thing ridiculous. He's 16 and he's with me, nothing was going to happen to him. I wouldn't ever let it. Plus I'm chronically ill and dying, I just want my brother to have as much time with me as possible before I go. We were just hanging out, wasn't really that deep.

He needs to be resting not spreading his germs to everyone!\n\nYou also didn't inform Mom where he was at. Thats on both of you since he is 16.\n\nThe offhand \"plus im actually dieing\" seems disingenuous. Are you in hospice care? Because there are actually people out here near deaths door and for you to make light of their situation just because a kids mom yelled at you for being irresponsible makes you an even bigger ahole.", "YTA for taking him out and around so many others when he\u2019s sick. You are chronically ill, I\u2019m sure you understand how easy it is for some of us to get seriously sick from a \u201ccold\u201d. If I catch a \u201ccold\u201d I can end up in the hospital. I\u2019ve basically been locked up in my house for close to 3 years thanks to rona, I was one of the cool kids who had to mask during flu season before rona was even a thing. If you\u2019d just done the park, maybe, but also parks close at dark so I don\u2019t really want to encourage you to be breaking the law with him. \n\nAlso the 3AM is a little late since it was a school night. (Unless school is on break, then disregard this part). But if he had school today that means he already felt shitty and now has to go to school on 3-4 hours of sleep. \n\nHis moms worry is probably not that something is going to happen to him with you, it\u2019s probably more of the fact that he has to be up early for school *and* is already sick. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you wanted to cheer him up, but please keep sick people home. It\u2019s flu/rona/RSV season, plus being out and about when you\u2019re sick is no fun anyways! Maybe next time you guys can order a pizza and rent some movies to watch, play a board game or a video game, or since you had fun hanging out at the park and talking about life do that, but in your backyard!", "YTA.

It's his mom's call as to how late he should be out, not yours.", "YTA. You took a SICK person out until 3 AM? To eat and go shopping and then walk around in the night air?\n\nYour little brother will not get well fast if you keep him up and about. You can hang out at home. Get takeout and watch a movie. You didn't have to take him on a grand adventure while he's sick. And if you're chronically ill, are you okay to be around people with colds? Or will that compound issues you have and makes things more difficult for you now?", "YTA. You should have given mom updates. Even if she gave you the greenlight to take him out, 3am is not reasonable without some extra communication.", "YTA, but that's a fairly soft one.  3 am is really late, especially if it's a school night and mom didn't know.", "YTA, gently\n\nTaking him out to busy places while ill is just rude and dangerous to others (have we all already forgotten all the lessons of the last few years?! If you are sick **stay home**). \n\nIt\u2019s not like you stayed out to midnight where your brother could get at least some semblance of a decent night\u2019s sleep (especially important when sick, and on a school night if he is going the next day) and 3am is far too late without giving any kind of heads up or reassurance to his mom. Yes, he is 16 and with a trusted adult, but you are not his legal guardian, he is a minor, and his mom did not know that you would be out all night. \n\nSpend as much time with your brother as you can,  but be respectful to others at the same time.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nYou clearly love your brother and had good intentions. But if my 16 year old kid was gone until 3 am on a school night (sounds like you didn\u2019t communicate with her or let her know he was safe) I would be super worried, and then upset. She\u2019s his mom. She needs to know he\u2019s safe and is responsible for him getting to school the next day. When I was that age I got up at 6 for school.

It's really that simple. You had great methods of cheering him up but no stores are open from 12-3am. Plus outside and being active for that long while he's sick is not how one gets better quicker. \n\nEasier to ask for forgiveness than permission I presume. The mother was a bit dramatic but you still shouldn't have had him out that late", "\"His mom was PISSED at me.

Yeah, that changes everything. @OP, good intentions, but communication is still important and getting a minor home at a reasonable time (or at least reaching out to the parents to see if keeping them out late is okay), so the mother\u2019s frustration is understandable. Just apologize for bringing him home so late and discuss any boundaries she has with his curfew, etc. so that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nI hate to say YTA in this context, because you seem like a genuinely good brother. You\u2019re just definitely in the wrong here, though.", "You really had him out way to late. It\u2019s a sch night, he has a cold and has now exposed lots of people to it, including yourself.

Your intentions may be pure for you, but he's 16. You want to cheer him up, stay home and spend time with him. Especially when he's sick.", "NAH. You were doing a nice thing for your brother and got caught up in the moment, it happens. Sure, your mom has a bit of a right to be upset that she didn't know where you were/when you were coming home, but your brother is 16 ffs, not 8.

I think this is just a miscommunication, and nobody got hurt in the end.", "Not really the AH, At 16 my parents let me do basically anything as long as my grades and responsibilities didn't slip.

You should've handled things differently OP but that's about it, you didn't really do anything bad. I would apologize to the mom for scaring her tho.\n\nReally done with the \"YOU TOOK A SICK PERSON OUT??\"... it's a cold, he'll be ok.\nAlso, sometimes you feel like absolute shit in the morning and then feel better as the day goes on. Not to mention that OP is dying, if I were the brother, I would also try to spend time with my brother, even if it meant that I have to power through going out to do some shopping. \n\nYes, 3am is really late and yes, OP should've told the mom what they were doing and where they were. \nAnd even though the brother is a minor, he's 16!!
