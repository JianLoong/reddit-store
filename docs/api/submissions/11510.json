Normally I\u2019d say to mind your own business, but when it comes to safety concerns, you have every right to do what you need to do to protect your friend. I would do the same thing, even if it meant my friend would hate me for a while. Sometimes people who are in love allow themselves to be abused, and you don\u2019t have to sit back and watch it happen.", "NTA. More women are killed by their partners than strangers. She might not be ready to leave him yet ,but at least her dad is on notice. Remember Gabby Pettito", "NTA in any way, shape or form. You absolutely did the right thing. She might be mad but the important thing is she is safe.", "Your friend is not thinking right and putting herself in an unsafe situation. You are looking out for her. NTA.", "NTA. You did the right thing but doing the right thing isn't always free from consequences.", "NTA... your friend was being abused and is protecting her abuser.  She may hate you now but hopefully will realize you told her dad in order to protect her.", "NTA, it sounds like the relationship is still in the early stages. This is the time for her to get out now before it\u2019s really too late. She is not thinking clearly and blinded by what she thinks is \u201clove\u201d or she just may be too scared of him to end it.\n\nEither way, you couldn\u2019t sit idly by and do nothing. \n\nThis may ruin the friendship, but one day she will understand. I understand why you think she\u2019s ungrateful but she\u2019s been experiencing abuse. She\u2019s not in a good headspace, so I wouldn\u2019t take it personally.", "NTA! It is so common for people who are in abusive relationships to make excuses for the other person and can\u2019t make the decision to leave for themselves. Most times it takes a massive force to make it happen and you started that force coming down the line. Let her be pissed at you bc that means she is still alive and around to be mad. That\u2019s more important than her feelings in this situation. Good on you for being a loyal friend.", "NTA. Good for you! Even if she doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore you did the right thing. That is never okay", "NTA and thank you.", "NTA\n\nYou may have lost your friend, but maybe she won't lost her life thanks to you.", "NTA. You did the right thing. It's also common for victims of abuse to make excuses for their abusers and to get mad at the ones trying to help them. Hopefully your friend does break up with him and realizes that you were helping her. She might not. That doesn't mean you were wrong. Either way, she's going to need a lot of love and support.", "NTA. \n\nShe will thank you eventually. You did the right thing.", "The only AH here is the abusive boyfriend. Never okay.", "Nta as someone who stayed in abusive relationships in the past way too long until i learned better you did the right thing.  She'll be mad but you saved her a lot of trauma", "NTA. You definitely did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nIf your roommate wants to risk her life, that's her choice. You on the other hand, are under no obligation to do the same if you don't want to. You did the right thing. Personally, I'd go as far as saying that if she wants to end the friendship over it, then so be it. At least you'll sleep at night knowing that you didn't keep it from her father and if anything does happen, it won't be your fault.", "NTA - hopefully her dad gets her into therapy.  You might suggest that if you see him again.", "NTA, you did what every good friend should do in a situation like this. You didn't immediately went to the parent, you talked to her first. Sometimes victims are too twisted in the story they've been fed to do something for themselves. Don't feel bad!", "NTA. You were just looking out for your friend.", "Personally I don't think YTA, maybe you overstepped but it was from a place of concern. And it is hard knowing what to do with people in abusive relationships, as it is easy to push them further into their abusers. All you can do now is you've said your peace but she has to leave that relationship herself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your roommate might be angry with you, but it's misplaced anger, so don't let it get to you. \n\nIf you have a chance, just tell your roommate, that there's zero chance you let her get beat up by her boyfriend, continuing dating him, and you stay quiet about it. Zero chance. That if she's do deep in this abusive situation, you're not, her boyfriend is 100% in the wrong, your friend doesn't deserve to be abused, and you're not going to be quiet about it."]}
