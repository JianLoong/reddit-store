We\u2019ve talked about buying a house together in the future but the problem is that she can\u2019t save money. We live in a 2br apartment because she needs 1 to be her walk in closet. She has the newest iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, and AirPods Max. She just bought herself a Tesla while I\u2019m driving a 2015 Honda. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not complaining. In fact, I\u2019m perfectly okay with her spending her own money because we\u2019re both young and she deserves to enjoy her life.\n\nRecently her aunt announced that she\u2019ll be moving into a retirement community and will be selling her house. Since they are close, she offered to sell it to us before listing it. She wants $75,000 down and is willing to finance the purchase for us. Honestly it\u2019s a good deal but the problem is my wife has less than $500 saved so I\u2019ll have to pay the entire $75,000. The monthly payments for the house will be more than our rent so I\u2019ll have to cover the difference as my wife can\u2019t pay more. Then there\u2019s the yearly $6,500 in property tax which I will have to pay for myself. Lastly, the house needs a new roof which will cost $18,000. \n\nShe and her aunt were talking like it\u2019s a done deal but all I see is a bunch of money I have to pay out all on my own. I told her Friday that we should pass on this one. She kept on saying what a great deal it is and that we\u2019ve always planned on getting a house to start a family. After hours of discussions, I got tired and told her we will get a house when she gets pass her spending phase and starts saving phase. I pointed out all the cost I listed above and she was really hurt. She cried and said that we\u2019re supposed to be a team then went to bed. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since Friday night and we\u2019re supposed to go to her parents for dinner tonight. Her aunt will be there and I know the house thing will come up.\n\nAm I wrong for not wanting to buy the house by myself?\n\nUpdate\n\nHi all and thanks for reading. I\u2019m going to answer some of your questions.\n\n1. I\u2019m 29 and she\u2019s 25.\n2. We both work full time. She makes about $85,000 and I make about $150,000.\n3. Her aunt got several quotes on the roof. The roof is old, not damaged so insurance won\u2019t cover it. I\u2019ve never own a house so I don\u2019t know how it works but that\u2019s what she told us.\n4. There are other things the house needs to be done to it but the roof is the immediate need. The insurance guy said it needs to be done before the current coverage runs out and they offer new coverage.\n5. She went to a realtor and had the house appraised. She offered to sell to us below the appraised price and finance without any interest which is why I said it\u2019s a good deal.\n5. Our rent is $1300 a month.\n\nDinner is in 3 hours and I\u2019ll update again if you all have more questions or if something happens at dinner. I\u2019m trying to read all of your comments.\n\nUpdate \n\nGood evening all. Dinner went as I expected. I\u2019m going to answer some more questions.\n\n1. Her aunt wants $75,000 down because she going to use that money to move into the retirement community. She said the house appraised for $400,000 but going to sell it to us for $350,000 and wants us to pay it off in 10 years. The monthly payment will be about $2,300 a month. My wife and her aunt came to these figures based largely on how long her aunt expects to be active and wants to use the money to travel and enjoy life.\n\n2. At dinner my wife and her family were telling me what a great deal this is. I have zero experience with buying a house but I read your replies so I didn\u2019t really argue with them. I calmly told them that I want an independent appraisal so that we can have the full financial information. They said the realtor already told them how much it\u2019s worth and they have the tax appraisal. As some of you advised, I stuck to my guns and said I wanted a professional and independent appraiser. I also told them I\u2019m going to call my older brother and have him fly out here to help me out because he has experience while I have none. They agreed and things went smoothly after that.\n\n3. We\u2019re sleeping in the same bed again and she\u2019s happy I\u2019m seriously considering the house. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to find an appraiser and we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\n4. It might take a couple of weeks and I think Reddit will archive my post by then but I\u2019ll try to give an update if anything happens. If you want to DM me, feel free to in a couple of weeks and I\u2019ll answer you.\n\nThanks again for reading and responding.", "created_utc": 1696774424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17305ju/aita_for_not_wanting_to_buy_a_house_with_my_wife/", "score": 4370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Studies actually show that men and women spend frivolously at the same rates, but men tend to make higher $ purchases, so their spending is slightly higher than women. \n\nI used to be one of these paycheck to paycheck spenders, and I'm 100% an Amazon addict, but I reigned myself in because I too want to buy a house. Until recently I was too disabled, and too low paid to even consider it on a remote off-chance. My situation changed, I was able to buy a decent car for the first time in a almost two decades, pay off my credit card debts, and start saving. \n\nI had to really want it! Not have it be some nebulous thing out in the periphery. \n\nI developed a spreadsheet for my monthly budgeting. I opened a few bank accounts to transfer money between to keep it all organized. (This is key, to have a spending account, savings account, and bills account all separate.) I opened a high yield savings, and started some small investments through Robinhood, and a Roth IRA. (on top of my pension and 401k type account.) I developed a plan to pay off my credit cards, higher interest rates and lowest balance first, which lowers my DTI (Debt to Income ratio) faster, and frees up money faster as well. That spreadsheet is what I live and die by now, and I love to see the percentages of debt get lower and lower each month, and my investments growing.\n\nTry giving your wife a goal, of an amount of savings, and DTI that will be sufficient to start looking at houses. Suggest she sell some of her excess \"stuff\" to help pay off her debts faster. Suggest throwing more money at her highest interest cards, or a personal loan to consolidate the debt, with a lower interest rate than the cards are. She might be able to pay that loan off faster than her cards individually. (I wouldn't suggest trying this until she stops overspending, or she will wind up worse off.) She needs to be able to see how much she is spending on things that are inconsequential. \n\nIf she can't manage to save and pay down, then not buying a house is clearly an issue in her court. You clearly have the right way of things of being hand-off about her spending, and not constantly judging her and chiding her is the right approach. It isn't enabling like others seem to think, it's approaching the situation in the right way. That her addiction is not a moral failing, and you support her emotionally, but won't contribute to it monitarily and risk your own financial future. Arguing about her spending will only make things worse. Allow her to fail, because she can only recover if she can see the problem. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the Aunt's house is not in the cards for you right now, maybe if she had brought it up a few years ago, which would have given her a chance to figure this stuff out. Maybe the aunt can rent the home out until you're ready to buy it? Assuming you even want it, anyway.

I sold cars for a while, and was the used car manager.\n\nThe more expensive the car and the worse the credit, the lower the odds they have any equity, and they often can't get out of the car without rolling negative equity over. Because most banks limit how much negative equity can roll over (% of car value), you have to buy an expensive enough car to eat the negative value.\n\nIf you buy a car on $0 down, (and most of the people coming in with fancy cars and needing to downgrade were buying on $0 down) you have the 50,000 car + tax and license, another 10%, here, roughly. So, 55,000 financed. Even if your car is still worth close to MSRP, the dealership is going to want a profit margin, plus they have to legally do inspections, etc. There's at least 750 in expenses just to get a car to the lot. Time of the sales and finance people, cleaning the car, time for the mechanic, the service writer, any minor repairs like wipers, tires, etc. Can easily go over 2.5k for a newer car, if tires are involved.\n\nSo, the dealership has to account for that. They also have a pack, built-in line item of profit for the dealership, ie, a $500 profit item paid to the owner of the dealership.\n\nSo, for a newer car to get to the front line, call it 1250-3000. That means for a car to sell for 45,000 to 50,000, you probably only want to offer 40,000 to 45,000, especially if you don't often sell EVs or Teslas. The rest of that profit is how the sales reps and managers get paid. You want at least 2500 cushion, at a minimum. So, you offer 40,000 to 45,000, and they paid 55,000 and only paid off down to 53,000 because more and more people are buying on 7 year loans. Especially those driving fancy cars they can't really afford.\n\nBuying the car at the higher end at 45,000, that is 8,000 in negative equity, and unless you have phenomenal credit, most places limit to 120%. That means, if tax and license add 10%, then you need that last 10% to cover the 8k in negative equity.\n\nMeaning, the person needs to pony up enough cash, while already struggling, to pay down their negative equity or cover tax and license. \n\nGetting a less expensive car *only* works if you are at a wash or have positive equity, or are close enough to breaking even to roll over or have fantastic credit.\n\nIt's hard. Even if you have a situation where you can cover 100% of tax/ license and you can put your entire negative equity into the loan, at 120% cap, you are only going down to a 40,000 vehicle. That's not a huge savings, given that your loan total went from 55,000 to 48,000. Better off paying the loan and hoping you can refinance to a better rate or longer term and lower your payments.\n\nThe wife has $500 in her bank account. The odds of her having positive equity are low. She can't pay down the negative equity. She's likely so underwater on that car she's hanging out with the Titan billionaires.\n\nWouldn't even be the worst ratio of value to loan balance I've seen. Car loan of 25,000 with over 14,000 in negative equity. Don't roll negative into a Dodge product, y'all.\n\nPeople end up trapped in cars all the time. Don't max your budget and at *least* have enough down to cover tax and license. If you have to buy in an emergency due to a total loss or something, buy the absolute least expensive vehicle that will suit your needs in that moment. Overextended loans are common and suck ass to try and get out of for the first 3-4 years, if you run into trouble.", "This is not true.", "I\u2019m curious as well.", "Fine... he's a quick barf out of the facts...

Also you say you're getting it at a bargain from her aunt, so just exactly how much is she trying to pawn it off on you for? I'm wondering if this sweetheart deal is more in her favor because the property as it is is not worth the price that she is asking.\n\nAll of that aside, I think you've approached this with your wife in the wrong manner. The first question is whether or not this house is worth the price that they are asking. The second question is to ask how much house do you need either now or in the future should you decide to have kids. That will help you decide whether or not this is a house that you actually want to buy or if you were just buying it because of the circumstances. I think those are the questions that need to be asked first. Also remember that however much you see this as a sweetheart deal, if you are getting a bank loan you will need a thorough inspection and an independent appraisal. From what you said she wants a lump sum of money up front from you and then you will pay her directly which sounds like a rent to own situation and if that's the case you still need an independent inspection and independent appraisal before you agree to any price.\n\nShould you find that this house is financially feasible for you and it's not a money pit and you can get the proper loans and paperwork approved, then you need to have a separate conversation with your wife. Explain to her that you are willing to buy a house with her but that it will require her to be equal Financial Partners in the purchasing of the house. That means if her aunt wants $75,000 up front that your wife needs to come up with a $37,500 on her own. Then she has to agree to pay half of the mortgage which is going to be between 2200 and $4,000 a month, not including the yearly property tax and insurance. There will also be a significant increase in utilities and $20,000 to fix the roof, and on a house that big it's probably going to be more. So tell her that when she has enough in savings to cover one year's mortgage plus down payment plus half of the amount to fix the roof and another $5,000 for emergencies, then you are more than happy to buy a house with her as equal partners. I am 100% sure that she will not be able to come up with 75,000, which would be her half of the deal, anytime soon and will continue to blame you for her inability to save or pay for her own way.\n\nNTA", "You're supposed to be a team?

The aunt is moving to a retirement community, different animal altogether.", "Might seem weird, but needing a spare bedroom for all her clothes and likely shoes and purses (my ex was one of these types that had zero skill to save money but was a master at spending) says it all. Her \u201cdisposable\u201d income goes to support what\u2019s likely a terrible shopping addiction.  She needs to grow and up and start saving if she\u2019s making 85k a year and he\u2019s making 150k and their rent is only 1300 total. $500 savings is a complete embarrassment regardless of her age with that kind of income and such low housing cost. \nOP definitely NTA.", "Very few things in life are as black or white as we would like to believe. Big life decisions require careful thought for all of the ramifications. \n\nIn a lot of situations people do stay for the kids, or because they can\u2019t afford to pay for two different apartments and one parent would be homeless. And that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad decision. The worst situation I can think of off the top of my head would be where one spouse is abusive to the children, and the court doesn\u2019t believe the allegations and requires supervised visitation \u2026 for the non-abusive parent. I would go back to an abusive partner rather than letting that person be alone with our kids. The long-term plan would still be to leave, of course, but it light be a number of years. \n\nA better way to respond to these posts is that OP probably won\u2019t be happy until they do get out of the relationship, and acknowledge that it may not be possible right now.", "To be fair...I also have a spare room as a walk in closet! Lol! And I do not have a spending addiction or inability to save money! Most of my stuff is thrifted and is a hobby to repair, upcycle, and style. Plus I am an aerialist and have lots of costumes for performances! Oh, and cosplay! But I budget for it and never, ever go over without sacrificing elsewhere. And savings for retirement comes first!\n\nBut yeah, definitely doesn't sound like the case with this lady with only $500 in savings, a tesla, and no ability whatsoever to help buy a house when she makes $85k a year and rent is that cheap!", "My work has free ev chargers for employees. Every time I pull up I wish I wasn\u2019t driving my diesel truck.", "Sweet, I didn't realize that this was a thing!  This is exactly what we're gonna have to get to if we want ubiquitous EVs.", "and that weighs in her favor - she will be able to charge at home, and have essentially zero (outside of the slightly higher electric bill) operating costs. Which could offset the higher price of the Tesla. A friend bought one a year ago, and told me he was amazed at the fact that is has cost him very little to run.", "Can\u2019t speak for all cars but I know that Toyota has changed their design so there is no need to replace the timing belt every 100,000 miles.\n\nTesla cars like Apple products from the old days where they were proprietary.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t maintenance and repairs but who can do the work.  I don\u2019t go to the dealership\u2026I want to have a honest analysis of the issue.\n\nMy auto mechanic is a car geek.  He was going to buy a Tesla but changed his minds when he started to research.  Also, he had several customers that had so many issues with electric and hybrid cars.\n\nBy the way, my mechanic has told me that there are cars that he tells his customers that they need to reprogram it at the dealership since they have the only access.", "It's genuinely super convenient. I even get parking closest to my apartment entrance because that's the dedicated ev spots. I'm convinced they just like prospective tenants getting to check out my sexy mustang when they visit because it seems to be what happens whenever I'm in the lobby to notice.", "Except that she isn't going to be charging at home because OP isnt keen on being the only one making financially sound decisions.", "It's an example, all cars have maintenance costs. So pointing at the price of a battery, is nominal because it will be covered under warranty, when you finally do have to replace it, you have to weigh that against all the the maintenance you would have done with an ICE in the meantime."]}
