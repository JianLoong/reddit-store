She has the newest iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, and AirPods Max. She just bought herself a Tesla while I\u2019m driving a 2015 Honda. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not complaining. In fact, I\u2019m perfectly okay with her spending her own money because we\u2019re both young and she deserves to enjoy her life.\n\nRecently her aunt announced that she\u2019ll be moving into a retirement community and will be selling her house. Since they are close, she offered to sell it to us before listing it. She wants $75,000 down and is willing to finance the purchase for us. Honestly it\u2019s a good deal but the problem is my wife has less than $500 saved so I\u2019ll have to pay the entire $75,000. The monthly payments for the house will be more than our rent so I\u2019ll have to cover the difference as my wife can\u2019t pay more. Then there\u2019s the yearly $6,500 in property tax which I will have to pay for myself. Lastly, the house needs a new roof which will cost $18,000. \n\nShe and her aunt were talking like it\u2019s a done deal but all I see is a bunch of money I have to pay out all on my own. I told her Friday that we should pass on this one. She kept on saying what a great deal it is and that we\u2019ve always planned on getting a house to start a family. After hours of discussions, I got tired and told her we will get a house when she gets pass her spending phase and starts saving phase. I pointed out all the cost I listed above and she was really hurt. She cried and said that we\u2019re supposed to be a team then went to bed. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since Friday night and we\u2019re supposed to go to her parents for dinner tonight. Her aunt will be there and I know the house thing will come up.\n\nAm I wrong for not wanting to buy the house by myself?", "created_utc": 1696774424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17305ju/aita_for_not_wanting_to_buy_a_house_with_my_wife/", "score": 453, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That way if anything were to go south, dividing them would be fairly easy. 75k plus other costs is a lot of money to put down on a house you could potentially lose in a divorce.

Studies actually show that men and women spend frivolously at the same rates, but men tend to make higher $ purchases, so their spending is slightly higher than women. \n\nI used to be one of these paycheck to paycheck spenders, and I'm 100% an Amazon addict, but I reigned myself in because I too want to buy a house. Until recently I was too disabled, and too low paid to even consider it on a remote off-chance. My situation changed, I was able to buy a decent car for the first time in a almost two decades, pay off my credit card debts, and start saving. \n\nI had to really want it! Not have it be some nebulous thing out in the periphery. \n\nI developed a spreadsheet for my monthly budgeting. I opened a few bank accounts to transfer money between to keep it all organized. (This is key, to have a spending account, savings account, and bills account all separate.) I opened a high yield savings, and started some small investments through Robinhood, and a Roth IRA. (on top of my pension and 401k type account.) I developed a plan to pay off my credit cards, higher interest rates and lowest balance first, which lowers my DTI (Debt to Income ratio) faster, and frees up money faster as well. That spreadsheet is what I live and die by now, and I love to see the percentages of debt get lower and lower each month, and my investments growing.\n\nTry giving your wife a goal, of an amount of savings, and DTI that will be sufficient to start looking at houses. Suggest she sell some of her excess \"stuff\" to help pay off her debts faster. Suggest throwing more money at her highest interest cards, or a personal loan to consolidate the debt, with a lower interest rate than the cards are. She might be able to pay that loan off faster than her cards individually. (I wouldn't suggest trying this until she stops overspending, or she will wind up worse off.) She needs to be able to see how much she is spending on things that are inconsequential. \n\nIf she can't manage to save and pay down, then not buying a house is clearly an issue in her court. You clearly have the right way of things of being hand-off about her spending, and not constantly judging her and chiding her is the right approach. It isn't enabling like others seem to think, it's approaching the situation in the right way. That her addiction is not a moral failing, and you support her emotionally, but won't contribute to it monitarily and risk your own financial future. Arguing about her spending will only make things worse. Allow her to fail, because she can only recover if she can see the problem. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the Aunt's house is not in the cards for you right now, maybe if she had brought it up a few years ago, which would have given her a chance to figure this stuff out. Maybe the aunt can rent the home out until you're ready to buy it? Assuming you even want it, anyway.

If she had twenty thousand to put down toward it, I'd probably be leaning toward maybe considering it, but she has nothing. 500 is NOTHING.\n\nyou guys need to sit down and talk finances. If she wants you to be the one to brin gin all the money and put down payments like that for her, than I hope you are getting what you want from this partnership - is she a homemaker?

Couldn't buy her Christmas or birthday presents because she'd already bought everything she ever wanted.  New cars every year without any spousal input.  Took cruises, vacations 4Xs a year.  Never saved a cent.  In fact nothing but debt.  Me wanting to save the marriage and make things work went to 6 marriage counselors.  5 of them wanted to meet with her one on one.  Then ranted that they all picked on her and it wasn't fair.  She refused the 6th one... which was a guy that asked me what the hell I was doing in the marriage.  I even got a call from AmEx while she was on a cruise with 20 of her friends that we owed $20K for three months and they were about to throw it to collections.  Towards the end I liquidated my grandmothers inheritance to afford her.  Final straw was her taking a MBA class in England (I was not permitted to go) where she flew first class on Virgin and took the QE2 home.  She was mystified when I wanted a divorce.  She was insulted when I told her personal joy joy counselor (who wanted to meet the evil ex) all the things she'd done to our credit.  Divorce was a nightmare with one kid.  \n\nSo my advice is cut your loses.  Get a simple divorce.  It's not going to get easier.  She's not going to change.

In a community property state, she will be entitled to half your assets and you will be entitled to half her debt.
