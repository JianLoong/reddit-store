{"id": 15050, "submission_id": "12pt41k", "title": "AITA for not wanting to help pay for my child's University fees?", "selftext": "Hey Reddit. \n\nIt's been one hell of a month so some things I say might not make sense. \n\nI (40m) recently found out that I have a child, who we'll call Jane (18f).I wasn't convinced at first but everything checks out. When she came to me she told me that she just wanted to get to know her father. I wasn't really interested in a relationship but felt it would be cruel and unnecessary to deny her this. We talked for a while and I didn't really say much it but it was interesting. So after we talk for a while I ask about her mother, \"Grace\" (40f) and she gives me her number. I really didn't want to have to call her but I needed answers.\n\nSo Grace and I  decided to meet up at a local coffee shop. We have some small talk for while before I ask her why she never told me. Silence. I ask again. Silence. I ask a third time and she told me that she just didn't want anything to do with and wanted to \"get back at me\". I point out that all she did deprive the  child of a father. She says she does. I ask her when did she tell Jane. She says at age 12. So I get confused and am wondering why she only contacts me now. So I ask her why. Grace says that she was angry that I wasn't present in her life. We talk some more about life before we say goodbye and go our separate ways. \n\nI don't ask Jane why she didn't call sooner because she was a hurting teen and that's life. So Jane and I spend the next week \"bonding\". Then she sits down and asks to talk. I say sure and sit down. Then she goes on to explain about how difficult her life was living in a single parent household and how money was always tight. Long story short she asks me to pay for her university fees. Now I am well off enough to pay for it without struggle. So I ask to see her grades and to be truly honest it's meh. Not bad but nothing to give a second look. I tell her that I'll think about it and she says thank you. \n\nSo here's where I might be the AH. I don't want to pay for the fees because, in reality, she is just a stranger with my DNA. And I feel like Jane might just be using me. I mean she has had 6 years to firm a relationship with me and is only doing now that she needs something. I just want to wash my hands clean of her and Grace and move on with my life. I don't want Jane to think I'm her financial lifeline or anything like that.\n\nSo, Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit to add some stuff because of the comments.\n\n1. I did a DNA test. It was what she wanted me to do to prove herself.\n\n2. Child support laws are different in my country in the sense that: A. You can't claim unclaimed child support if you had the option to claim it. B. Child support can't be settled after 18 unless the father knowingly disappeared and that would take months to process let alone prove.\n\n3. Jane had the ability to contact me. I don't know how much influence her mother had on her choice but I do know that I was a dial away.", "created_utc": 1681758503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pt41k/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_pay_for_my_childs/", "score": 2794, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grace is a tremendous AH to both of you.\n\nI do encourage you to seriously consider contributing to Jane's university expenses (not to say you should or should not contribute, just seriously and honestly consider it). Think about her position - no father in her life and a mother who won't answer any questions she has for the first 12 years - then who knows what context Grace gave her when she finally did tell her? I'll bet she never said \"I never told your father about you because I wanted to spite him and I didn't care what effect that had on your childhood,\" despite that being the truth, instead she undoubtedly made you into the bad guy. Jane had no way of knowing better, and you should be sympathetic to that.\n\nI don't think you're an AH no matter what you decide, just don't do anything to spite Jane, she's had enough of that already.", "NAH- she is a kid who just met her dad. University is the biggest thing on her mind and she says that dad has funds so why not ask.  \n\nI wouldn't if I was her but I get it. And you're not the A for thinking... hmm this is weird. If it was a year or two from now after yall have caught up so and formed a bond...   \n\nIt also sucks as you didn't get a shot but may have just gained a daughter. If it was me- I would've said let's reset and not have this convo now as we are strangers. Let's become familiar and we can talk way down the road on this topic.  \n\nBut yeah rock and a hard place for sure", "Hmmm.  NTA.. but contributing some part would be a good thing.\n\nI don't understand folks piling on you....it's not like you knew about Jane and ran off.  Yes, she was deprived of a father, but you were also deprived of a daughter.  Not sure why mom or daughter is angry at you for not being present.", "She was a teen who was manipulated by her mother.  I highly doubt the mother would have allowed her to reach out prior.\n\nI don't think you should fault your child for her mother's actions, especially if it won't put a strain on your resources.\n\nAlso, while her grades may be underwhelming, she still deserves a chance to have more opportunities. \n\nIf you are concerned about your relationship becoming strictly financial, I say have a conversation about it.", "NTA. And you are totally right, this is not about a relationship with you, but with your money.", "NTA but she is a kid that was raised by a woman who had a Vendetta against you. It means 18 years of poisoning (if you are sure that she is your dna) .\n\nI mean in her eyes you are this vilan and her mother is the hero.\n\nAsk your self this am i Willing to risk loosing x amount of money to the chance of having a child. If the answer is yes so you might do it if its no so don't do it", "NTA.\n\nYou were deliberately deprived of a relationship with your child. Now she/they (I'm assuming Grace probably pushed this on Jane) want money. That's just messed up, IMO.", "NTA at all for how you feel.\n\nFirstly, Im hoping you had a DNA test to be sure Jane is actually your child?\n\nSecondly, its understandable why Jane didnt contact you before, particularly as you dont know what Grace said to her about you (especially as Grace admitted that she wanted to get back at you) so it could be that she was 'talking smack' about you to Jane all this time.\n\nThirdly, its your choice whether or not to pay for Janes University fees, and I wouldnt call you the AHole for not doing so. However, you also never had to pay child support for Jane all these years (and be aware that some States do award retroactive child support, even when the parent had no knowledge of the child) so I would imagine University fees would be alot less than that. \n\nAdditionally if you choose not to help Jane financially, chances are nil to none that she would choose to have a relationship with you going forward. \n\nYou say (now) that you just want to wash your hands of her and Grace, but 10 years from now will that still be the case?\n\nEither way, its your choice and Im not going to judge you poorly either way.", "NTA. She calls you when she needs money, not when she first got your number. Tell her you want to know her more before paying(ask her to do a gap year), and if she gets angry or drops contact with you, then you have your answer. If she gives you the time of day, pay the school directly so she can't touch the money.", "NTA but I'd you do decide to give or lend her money I recommend talking to a lawyer first.", "NTA. \n\n> she is just a stranger with my DNA\n\nYup. And one that wants to use you as a piggybank, no less.", "NTA, she only sought you out for money. I don't think she would have looked for you without needing money. She's spent all these years hating you and possibly being poisoned against you. She's not looking for a warm, fuzzy father/ daughter relationship.", "NTA. But one option might be to gift a lump sum, doesn\u2019t have to be huge, for her to use for expenses. If you spend some time getting to know her and decide you want to help. But I would also be direct and ask her why now?  It is ok to be clear that you feel like her reaching out is about the money, and see how she responds and then decide how to move forward", "NTA.\n\nHer grades may be underwhelming, but then, her choice of college may be (should be) as well - she cannot be planning on Harvard or something like that. If you are interested in bonding with her, it should be first on her plans for study / life; help with getting there on her own (student loans? housing? jobs?). Great topics to hash out over coffee, or lunch ...  I can imagine even something like \"I might help with paying back a part of your study loans upon graduation\" - which also implies staying cordial for four years. \n\nAs soon as she is unreasonable in her requests (demanding money, while she has **zero** to expect!!), the relationship will lapse, and she will have gotten  nothing. If she stays reasonable, maybe you will end up with a daughter, and she might end up with a father.", "NTA but the mother seems to be an AH, but we also don't know the full story.  \n\nI have two friends where something similar this has happened one found out about 20 years ago, the other 18 months ago. Ironically also daughters. \n\nThey have both formed relationships with their children and both are really glad that they did. \n\nIf you ever want to have a relationship with Jane, you should pay for her university, she didn't choose this scenario and it sounds like her mother is out for revenge on you, and has been feeding your daughter stories. Don't burn that bridge, it's been a shock to the system give it time to process. Maybe say to Jane - you will pay the first semester / year and see how you go from there - that will give you time to process.", "Wait, so Grace purposely kept OP and Jane apart, but she\u2019s mad at OP for not being involved in Jane\u2019s life?\n\nNTA. Was all fine and good to keep OP in the dark until they needed something. They don\u2019t get to be mad at OP for not being there for Jane when she was kept a secret.", "NTA. I had struggling parents and took out loans and worked during school. It wasn\u2019t ideal compared to having someone just pay for my school but I did what I had to and it worked out.\n\nIf you want yo get to know Jane you could offer to help in a small way such as helping her get a loan or assistance with small fees like books or application fees for community college.  Set expectations such as reevaluating your agreement each semester.  Also be honest and tell her your afraid that your being taken advantage of and see what she says. \n\nThe only flip side to any of this is had her mom filed for child support you coulda been on the hook for that.  She made the choice to not do that and could have made life easier for Jane and given you the chance to know her earlier.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants your money, not you.", "Cutting her out of your life because she dared ask for money would absolutely be an AH move. There isn't a ton else you can do as a father at this point of your lives.\n\nAnd you don't have to just give the cash btw, you can e.g. structure it as a long term 0 interest loan with maybe some percentage being a performance dependent gift (since you asked for grades seems like this is smth you'd like).", "[deleted]", "NAH except Grace. Grace lied to you and Jane; she caused this entire situation. \n\nJane...I don't blame her for not reaching out until now. From what you've written, it does not sound like Grace would have supported her in contacting you and Jane was a child. \n\nUni fees...tbh I'd see that as getting off lightly given you never had to pay child support. Entirely Grace's fault, but as usual the child is the one who suffers.", "This is a NAH situation. You're going to have to think about this situation and do what's morally right for yourself. I would personally be conflicted as well this is just a stranger with your DNA but it wasn't the child's fault at all so there is no clear moral direction.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are right, she is a stranger who you share DNA with. This is neither of your faults, it's her mother's.\n\nIt is suspicious they are just now coming to see you when they want something.", "NTA, but if it occurs to you to pay for school, make her prove herself first through community college first.  The thing I find odd is that in not knowing whether you\u2019d pay for school, her grades aren\u2019t so great.  You\u2019d think she\u2019d really be trying for scholarships if she knows her mom can\u2019t fund it.", "NTA. Not trying to say she\u2019s trying to use you, but if I were in her shoes, I would not be asking for money.", "NTA - she only looked for you because she needed money", "NTA her mother deprived her of a father, and you of a child.  If she was struggling so much as a single mother, she could have made you aware of Jane and requested child support.\n\nIt's suspicious that you were only contacted now, when they're faced with university costs.  I don't feel you are obligated to provide that, regardless of your financial standing.  Don't be surprised if Grace goes after back payments of support though, especially if you now have a confirmed DNA test.", "NAH,\n\nSo the whole circumstance of this is kinda odd. Though even if she only met up with you to ask for money, I can hardly blame her, college is expensive and loans can be pretty aggressive. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you, though maybe I\u2019d do a loan with no interest because she does have your blood and maybe she\u2019s being genuine.", "NTA. She is using you.  She is also not very good at it. A proper user would have hooked you for at least several months.  It is up to you to determine if stranger with your DNA deserves a support", "NTA but neither is jane but i do think you should help jane out its not her fault she never had a relationship with you its the mothers fault but i dont think she should be deprived of her education especially if youre well off like you said.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Grace sucks. Jane I'm leaning towards being an AH too but not sure, but it sounds super fishy to me that she could've contacted you years ago and then asks you the second time she meets you for tuition help.\n\nAs a gesture I might make some kind of contribution but... Idk, I'd try to find a way to try and figure out the nature of your relationship before you do, just so things are clear.", "NTA\n\nMy gut feeling is she has no interest in establishing a relationship with you. She just wants your money. I would not feel any obligation to pay for her university fees or for anything else. If either of you want to try to establish a relationship, that has to start from ground zero, and it can't start with asking for money. I'd suggest telling her that you would like to be a part of her life and to get to know her. Suggest the two of you meet for dinner once a month and see how she reacts. If all she is interested in is asking for money, for school, for rent, you will have your answer. If she genuinely wants to form a relationship, then 5, 10 years down the road, you may feel differently about helping her.", "NTA but if I had the means I would it\u2019s an opportunity to know your kid", "I\"m gonna say NAH, but there's a lot of other things in your post that do make you an AH.\n\nShe was a 12 year old girl at the time.  You do not put adult responsibilities of forging a relationship with a strange man she's told is her father on a 12 year old girl and act like it's her own failing for not having six years of a relationship with you.  That is unfair to her and it really sounds like part of your reasoning is blaming her for that.  If you really need to place blame, then that's on her mother for putting the two of you in this position in the first place and not taking action to help facilitate a relationship, not the minor child.  No minor child should be contacting strangers on their own to engage in a parent-child (or any) relationship, and especially not when clearly not approved or facilitated by her custodial parent.\n\nI also think it's an asshole thing to look at (and judge) her grades as part of this decision making process.  Especially when it's pretty clear that you have no intention of paying regardless.  It just comes off as petty and superficial.\n\nSo, legally, you may not be obligated to do a damn thing.  And if you don't want to help her, that's certainly your right.  But please take the prior two things out of our reasoning for it because that treads dangerous close to AH territory.", "NTA imo", "NTA. But hear me out, why don\u2019t you give a lump sum as backlog child support to her and maybe wash your hands off this situation?? Make it a clear cut break so that she wont come back to you again.", "She knew at 12 and didn't want you in her life until it was time to pay for university.\n\n100% your choice, but NTA to not pay.", "Lol i can\u2019t believe the comments", "NTA\n\nShe is a Stranger. Why should you pay for a strangers uni?\nAlso yes she had it hard being raised alone, but thats on her mum not on you.\nShe could be any poor child without a dad, which sucks, you still have no obligation to pay though.", "NTA BUT if you can afford it and choose to id suggest that you pay the money directly to the school. You don\u2019t know that this is what they really want the money for. Don\u2019t become an ATM for either the mom or child.", "NTA. Jane's mother was immature and should have told you when she was pregnant, and gotten 18 years of child support for her daughter. Her selfish attitude is what left Jane with a low income household and no father figure. It sucks for you and Jane both, but unfortunately, you are kind of at a point where you have no legal obligation as a father, and your relationship with your adult daughter is up to you to dictate now.", "yta just help your kid you say you can afford it no problem don't be mean", "YTA - but only because you ask why Jane didn't seek you out sooner. She was a child until recently as far as the law is concerned.  It would require information from Grace to be able to find you and you've given no indication that Grace was forthcoming with that information.\n\nThat said, while she may be biologically your child she is not emotionally attached to you in any way.  You have to decide how you want to proceed from here, there are no wrong answers.", "YTA\nShe\u2018s struggling, she never had a father and while that may not be your fault because you didn\u2018t know, you do know now. It\u2018s up to you now if you want to make a change in her life and step up for her, or to let her down. I would say that how you will respond to this is gonna deeply reflect your values. Will you just carry on with your life and act like nothing happend and blend out the fact that you have a child who wishes for a protecting father and you activly refuse to step up? How would you want to be treated? How would you, as a child, wish to be treated? And are you going to act like the father you would want?", "YTA, for your actions and for making yourself look like a victim. You fathered a child without even knowing, and your reaction to this isn\u2019t horror at unintentionally dropping a kid into the world and doing nothing to care for it, but also to seek to blame everyone but yourself?\n\nAt the very least, check the rules around financing college. You didn\u2019t say what country you\u2019re in, but if it\u2019s like mine, then both parents are expected to contribute no matter what the custody situation is. And because of that expectation, students themselves are strictly limited on how much they can get in loans, unless they obtain official paperwork proving they have a deadbeat parent. \n\nSo first, helping with university is the practically least you can do, considering 18 years of doing nothing. And second, the very least you can do is cooperate with your kid in whatever she needs to prove you have never and will never give her any money.", "NTA. Grace is definitely the AH. I would suggest getting to know your bio daughter more and see if she genuinely wants a relationship or just someone to bankroll her education which based on timing, is definitely a concern.", "NTA, but whatever the history is, the fact is she is your daughter and she was deprived of having a father for the important years of her life (no fault of yours)\n\nI believe you should help her out, especially if it\u2019s not going to cause you any financial difficulty.", "NTA that\u2019s not your child.\n\nOh you might have provided dna, but the other contributor made sure this wasn\u2019t your kid. \n\nThis person is a stranger you happen to be related to, you don\u2019t owe them anything.", " NTA, your daughter's mother is a huge one though,  and thank your lucky stars you're not in the US.

Turns out the mother was well aware that the child was his but had been passing the child off as someone else's and when they split decided to file...after 5 years.", "If she turns out to be your child, your feeling might change. You might be like this because you're not sure and just stringing along.\n\nUpon confirmation, you might become passionate about her future and the passion might become contagious and infect her. \n\nNevertheless, if no such passion develops, you are obliged to pay her school fees, even if you think she's exploiting you.

When she came to me she told me that she just wanted to get to know her father. I wasn't really interested in a relationship but felt it would be cruel and unnecessary to deny her this. We talked for a while and I didn't really say much it but it was interesting. So after we talk for a while I ask about her mother, \"Grace\" (40f) and she gives me her number. I really didn't want to have to call her but I needed answers.\n\nSo Grace and I  decided to meet up at a local coffee shop. We have some small talk for while before I ask her why she never told me. Silence. I ask again. Silence. I ask a third time and she told me that she just didn't want anything to do with and wanted to \"get back at me\". I point out that all she did deprive the  child of a father. She says she does. I ask her when did she tell Jane. She says at age 12. So I get confused and am wondering why she only contacts me now. So I ask her why. Grace says that she was angry that I wasn't present in her life. We talk some more about life before we say goodbye and go our separate ways. \n\nI don't ask Jane why she didn't call sooner because she was a hurting teen and that's life. So Jane and I spend the next week \"bonding\". Then she sits down and asks to talk. I say sure and sit down. Then she goes on to explain about how difficult her life was living in a single parent household and how money was always tight. Long story short she asks me to pay for her university fees. Now I am well off enough to pay for it without struggle. So I ask to see her grades and to be truly honest it's meh. Not bad but nothing to give a second look. I tell her that I'll think about it and she says thank you. \n\nSo here's where I might be the AH. I don't want to pay for the fees because, in reality, she is just a stranger with my DNA. And I feel like Jane might just be using me. I mean she has had 6 years to firm a relationship with me and is only doing now that she needs something. I just want to wash my hands clean of her and Grace and move on with my life. I don't want Jane to think I'm her financial lifeline or anything like that.\n\nSo, Reddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, I can afford to contribute x amount a month right now.  Her reaction should tell you pretty quickly if she's just in this for the cash grab.

Perhaps contributing a small amount (not a full university fee but like some sort of financial support) might be enough of an olive branch to jumpstart a relationship.

Her mom is a huge AH. Please be the bigger person.  Your kid has no fault in this mess.", "She was angry that you weren't present. That's reasonable. It wasn't your fault, but you weren't present. You may not be legally obligated, but your daughter went her whole childhood without the benefit of your presence or financial support, both of which she deserved.

Ask her to ask the stranger in the coffee shop, seeing as she feels so comfortable asking strangers for thousands.\n\nNTA.\n\nGood luck OP.", "YTA", "Lot of heartless people on here. It's not your fault, it's not the kid's fault. Help her with her school fees, don't be a jerk qualifying your support. Make the best of a horrible situation. Don't be the bad guy her mom says you are.", "YTA and the reasons are maybe not as cut and dried as you think. It's  because you seem to be blaming you daughter instead of her mother for what happened. It's not the kid's fault that her mom never told you about her until she was 12 nor is it  her fault for waiting 6 years after she found out who you were to connect with you. She probably felt that her mom would be mad if she did or maybe she was mad herself and only decided to go ahead with the contact when she called you.\n\nThe more important thing is though that it doesn't really matter if her grades aren't that great  because most people's grades aren't that great  but that doesn't mean they shouldn't go to college and their parents shouldn't pay for it if they do.\n\nThe most important thing is that you yourself said that you have the money  to pay so why not just pay for it anyway?  You got off paying zero dollars for her whole life so why don't you Just pay for her college and cal it even?", "Jane is not \u201ca stranger with your DNA.\u201d Sure you don\u2019t know her, so she is a stranger in that sense, but she isn\u2019t a totally unrelated person whose existence isn\u2019t your business (like, say, a sixth cousin you happened to meet). She is your daughter. You are partly responsible for her existence (and, therefore, her need for money). \n\nIn my opinion, that means you ARE obligated to help her out of her financial difficulty if you feasibly can. I accept your word that you aren\u2019t legally obligated, but the law =/= morality. YWBTA if you decided that her needs are not your problem. \n\nI\u2019ll be real with you: yes, I do think Jane is reaching out either solely or in large part because she wanted to ask you for money. Guess what? It doesn\u2019t matter, because as your child she is entitled to ask for that. But also, if you do help her, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your relationship will always be transactional. It just means that you start it with you stepping up and supporting her in a big way. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to get to know her during or after uni, if you decide you want that, and she\u2019ll be far more welcoming of that (and of your involvement with any grandkids, down the line) if you pay for her fees. \n\nI would encourage you to see this money as an investment in your family. You may not be that interested in Jane now, but that may change. If you ever change your mind, better not to slammed that door shut. I can tell you that, I\u2019d you choose not to pay the uni fees, you may be able to preserve some relationship with Jane, but it will definitely be negatively impacted. She will likely feel hurt. You may not have wanted a kid, but your choices landed you both in this situation, whereas Jane had no choice\u2014she is stuck with you as a dad. She probably feels like this is a small thing compared to all the time, attention, and money you (through no fault of your own) deprived her of through your absence as she was growing up.", "A very, very soft YTA. This isn\u2019t just a huge emotional upheaval for her, it\u2019s one for you too. You got screwed out of knowing your child when she was growing up, and now you\u2019re scrambling to figure out how this fits into your picture of your life and yourself. Your ex really fucked you and your kid over and now you have to figure out how to clean up the fallout.\n\nYour kid may have known since she was twelve, but she didn\u2019t really *know*. If you\u2019d brought up a child you\u2019d be able to see more of just how independent they aren\u2019t at that age. She\u2019ll have been clear mom didn\u2019t want you in her life, she\u2019ll have been scared, and honestly it\u2019s impressive that she\u2019s pushed through that to reach out as young as eighteen.\n\nIf you can comfortably and easily pay the fees then - fuck it, do it. You only get one life and sometimes when you turn people down for something like this you don\u2019t get a second chance to fix or have a relationship even if you later realise you really want one. You\u2019re not legally obliged for child support - but morally, really, you are. She\u2019s your kid. She\u2019s a whole human being who is on this earth 50% because of you and wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise. She\u2019s a part of you that\u2019s now walking around talking, trying to figure out the world. Making sure that little human gets the best start she can is something you\u2019re late to the party on, but you\u2019re there just in time for the grand finale on \u201ca start in life\u201d.\n\nIf you do this, the door is open to you maybe being able to have a family tie you would regret breaking when you\u2019re older. And yeah - there is a chance you\u2019re being used for your money, sure. We can\u2019t completely control for other people choosing to do the wrong thing. But *we can do the right thing anyway* and give them the opportunity to be better than we fear they might be.\n\nPay for her education, no strings attached. If it turns out to have been a bad plan and you go your separate ways then you can do it with a clear conscience knowing you did your good-faith best to help her in life as soon as you were able. If it turns out well then you may well find you\u2019re incredibly proud of the person you helped to create.\n\nThat\u2019s really the thing - as her dad, you helped create her in the first place, but you\u2019re *still* helping create who she will be as an adult, right now. The choices you make here are going to determine some big things about how she sees the world, how she sees family, how she sees men and how she sees herself, for the rest of your life. You\u2019re in at the deep end of being a dad on this. It\u2019s heavy. Be kind to yourself - but give her a chance to be your daughter and yourself a chance to be her dad.", "YTA\nI know this will be unpopular.\nAt the end of the day she is your child. Sure it was totally unfair for the mother not to tell you but that doesn't change the current situation. \nJane was 12 when she found out. It is not surprising that she would wait this long. I talk from experience. My dad left before I was born but both me and my mum were fine with it as I was an accident and he really wasn't in any shape to be a father and she wanted absolutely to keep me. \nFor as long as I remember, I knew the basics. Early teens I asked a bit more and got that he was a guitarist in a band, worked IT, his name and lived where I was born. I waited until I was 24 before I decided that it was time. Before then, most of the time, I didn't even think of him as I grew up with just a mum and it was normal for me. I didn't see the need to find out more. At 23 I got more curious and then I finally did a Google search with the tiny amount of info I had and found him. Luckily his band had had a bit of success back in the day and they had a website. \nSo this to say that her waiting 7 years is not strange. \nHer asking for money isn't what I would do but I don't blame her. You may not have known but if you had, you would have had far more to pay over the years. It doesn't matter if the law says she can't claim child support now, it's the principal that counts. It's probably not easy for her to ask you. \nYou also asking to see her grades is a bit wrong to me. If she doesn't get good enough grades, she won't be accepted. If she does get accepted, then the university thinks she has the qualifications. Not every student can get the best grades. That doesn't mean that they won't be able to follow or will be bad at the job they want. And maybe its because she grew up with money issues that her grades aren't better. The lack of money can have a very negative impact on your concentration, your stress and your mental health. Now this is not your fault but you have a chance to help now and you have the means. \nBut the real base for my YTA is you wanting yo cut all ties with her. Her mother is one thing but your daughter is another. Don't punish her for her mothers faults.", "It definitely sounds like she's just reaching out for money.

It would be done directly through the university, not giving her a check. I would probably pay for her entire tuition regardless of whether she wanted a relationship with me or not.

You have no obligation at all to provide for her now but it would be a lovely gesture. It would suck that you don\u2019t want to see a better future for her since she is blood. \n\nAs for your concern-As someone with underwhelming grades in highschool I now make over 6 figures in marketing. Highschool grades are not really an indication of college and future success. Most classes are bs busy work and they know it. Also look at her mom, did she have much guidance? \n\nMy partner is in the same pickle with his baby half sister. He actually wants to help but his mom poisoned their relationship. He felt duped because his sister asked for money to go to a concert for her bday and then didn\u2019t go and also didn\u2019t continue to call and talk to him. He gave it to her because he wanted to provide his sister with a good experience. This left a bitter taste in his mouth since she lied to him to get some money essentially. He would have let her move into our home and paid for her college if she bothered having a relationship with him. \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t care to develop a relationship with your daughter. Giving her some money for books would go a long way for good will. Ask her to go to you for some guidance along the way she may genuinely not know how to act properly after her mothers influence. \n\nIf your small gesture is taken for granted then you have your answer.", "NAH.\n\nIf Grace denied you a relationship with your daughter previously, you\u2019re signing off on it now.\n\n*All* father/child relationships begin with financial support.", "you have a long lost daughter.    \nYou have the means.\nOutside of this college tuition thing\u2026 Would you like to have a relationship with her?

Your daughter has had your contact info for years and only decided to talk to you cause she wants college money", "NTA- as many before have said that the mother is the AH. \n\nHere\u2019s my 2 cents. Make her go to school and get financial aid and student loans for 2 years. Use those 2 years to build a relationship and have her prove her worth with grades. Give her a guideline of what she needs to accomplish. After the 2 years of the relationship is still strong and her academics are high enough, agree to pay the loans off and the rest of schooling. Make her sign a contract even that if she drops out or something that she has to pay you back. \n\nThis could be a good opportunity for the two of you to build something special. Make sure it\u2019s clear to her that the lack of a relationship was not your fault and was her mothers.", "NTA", "Nta.  Sucky situation for you and your daughter.  \nAs an alternative to giving her the money, what about a low rate loan of some kind?

If a relationship develops and it becomes appropriate later, you can forgive the loan.\nTry to emember that it was your ex's choice to keep her from you. Your daughter was a child when she found out about you, and it's unreasonable for you to expect a 12-year-old to have decided to reach out to you when her mother was probably not encouraging it at all.  Even as an 18-year-old, it took a lot of guts for her to reach out to you. Regardless of motive.", "NTA. I would, however, ask her what her mother has told her, as well as why she's only reaching out now. Make it clear you're asking to understand, not to accuse or because you're judging her.

If you can afford it easily then it\u2019s something you can do to help your daughter. There are extenuating circumstances about why she didn\u2019t reach out. For the first 12 years it\u2019s obvious. The next six are more complicated. \n\nHere\u2019s what I would do, if I could genuinely afford it: offer to pay half and make a deal with myself that it\u2019s not conditional on anything. It\u2019s freely given. That way there\u2019s no pressure on anyone to fake a relationship. \n\nIf you don\u2019t end up with a relationship, then you have discharged any guilt you may feel later.

Let her know it's nothing against her, but she is a stranger. A stranger that show up, as soon as she is in need of a large amount of money. Also, how does she even know you have the money, to help (seems strange). Also I think the mom has alot to do with, when she contacted you.

Personally I feel like your best options either gently say no or contribute a small amount that you are comfortable with and say that\u2019s all you can offer her financially. If she cuts contact after either of those then you have your answer, she was using you. But if she does stick around and make a meaningful attempt to get to know you and wants you in her life regardless of the possibility of getting her college expenses covered by you, you can always make the decision later to pay off some portion of her loans once you have a better idea of who she is and what the entirety of her intentions were here. I don\u2019t think you can completely judge her and say she\u2019s definitely using you from what might have been a kid who\u2019s wanted to meet their dad but had been too nervous or scared (or  was prevented from doing so, potentially), but now maybe she has two reasons to reach out and the freedom to meet you on her own and had the options of either taking out loans (presumably) or overcoming fears she may have had around everything and hoping you may consider it while also wanting to get to know you regardless. You can always say no now and change your mind and contribute later if she becomes a bigger part of your life without strings attached in the meantime. \n\nBut you also won\u2019t be the bad guy if you refuse and go no contact. You have no emotional bond with her, through no fault of your own and ultimately her mother made her bed to lie in and she\u2019s the one responsible for the fallout if you decide not to have any part in the situation. But if you feel like you\u2019d have wanted to be in her life now if she hadn\u2019t led with \u201cI need money for school\u201d, then giving her the opportunity to organically show you whether or not she wants that too may be in both of your best interests. The decision to help her with school doesn\u2019t have to be a black and white yes or no, and it doesn\u2019t have to be a decision you stick to forever if you say no before you know whether this is more to her than a cashgrab.", "NAH, except for Grace.\n\nI do think you should attempt a relationship with your daughter. You don't sound very trusting of her, which is likely really about your distrust of her mom. That's understandable, but Jane will finally be in a position to learn who she is as an independent adult apart from Grace, and you could offer some serious assistance and perspective.\n\nThat said, you could consider offering to pay her fees after her first or second year.

Payments could be linked to attendance and grades so if she doesn't attend classes this  term then you won't be paying for next term.

She has to keep her grades up, she has to complete a 2 or 4 year degree in a good career field. She needs stay out of trouble. She has to apply for all the financial aid and scholarships she can get. She has to try to maintain a positive relationship with you. And most importantly, all money will be paid upon completion (ie: just pay off her student loans for her.)

Quite frankly, if OP has the means under the circumstances, I think it was bad manners - not to ask how he can help-.

Yes it falls at the time where she will be starting uni but that's not surprising. She has gained indepence and it is far easier for her to reach out then than when she was a teen. It's terrifying reaching out to a parent that you have never known. At 12, even 19, 20 I didn't have the courage. I reached out to my bio dad when I started uni but it was pure coincidence and I was lucky that where I live uni is cheap so I didn't need financial help. \nIt could well be that she never intended on asking but saw how well off he was, and that it wouldn't be a strain for him and decided that maybe she could ask after all.

If she stays in meaningful contact, and doesn\u2019t make a habit of asking for money or favors, then maybe down the road he might feel like making a contribution to her loans once she is further into or even finishes school. Once she\u2019s no longer a stranger who may or may not be reaching out now just for a money grab. Then he will be able to have time to see whether her intentions were mostly good, whether there is a bigger place to be had in each other\u2019s lives, and can get to know her or find out her true colors without the pressure of that expectation hanging over them. \n\nAlternatively, I don\u2019t think it would be unreasonable to just gently refuse and cut contact if OP really wants to. Her mother had ample time and opportunity to include him in and prepare him for this responsibility and chose not to. While there\u2019s a lot of room to roll with the situation and see if there\u2019s any chance to make up for some of the lost time and bond with her, ultimately her mom made the decision to cut him out until now and any fallout from him not contributing or not wanting to be a part of her life after missing her entire childhood is a result of her choice and her mess to clean up if he doesn\u2019t want to be a part of their life at all. Yeah, it might feel like shit for him for a while, but it\u2019s ultimately not his fault that he wasn\u2019t given the chance to make a meaningful bond with his kid to feel comfortable dropping large sums of money on her education.\n\nETA: Thank you for the award and all the upvotes friends \u2764\ufe0f", "Please remember most people commenting here are basement dwellers, teenagers or barely in their 20s :)", "Did she just turn 18?

I'm not inclined to necessarily call asshole for following the legalities on this one though I think it would be a kind and gracious thing to offer to help her, cautiously such as paying the school directly (so sort of a \"You'd be a really great person if you did this, but you'd be pretty meh but not quite TA if you didn't\").  However, if he has no inclination to have any relationship with her in the future, then refusing to help her is one way to fast track that.  I think the answer probably lies in some medium of taking some additional time to get to know each other, if both actually want a relationship, and then offering to pay a portion directly.

The only way you can get that from what I'm saying is if you've decided to. I never once blame OP for the situation prior to his being informed about it.\n\nI'm saying that I disagree with the idea that ignorance absolves him from any moral obligation to his daughter NOW. Which is the question he's asking. It's not \"AITA for never finding out I had a kid\" -- it's \"AITA for not paying her university fees.\"\n\nI think OP has covered the \"me\" part of this sad story. he's very in touch with his own experience. I do not need to comment on it.\n\nSo I'm not. I'm commenting on the question he asked -- and pointing out that, even though he did not know about his daughter, he still played a role in her creation and he holds a moral responsibility that he should give some deep consideration. It's not a legal question, either. It's an ethical one. If she was under 18, then the courts wouldn't give him an option. They'd tell him \"yes, you must give some of your money to benefit the life of the child you created.\" -- the woman he had this baby with, for god knows what reason, did not do this. And because of that, the child never got the benefit of her father's support.\n\nSo now she's an adult and she has asked him for money -- he is not telling us how much but I do not think it's going to be as much as Americans would think it is -- and the answer from a lot of people is that she only has a right to ask that question if she has developed an emotional bond to him.\n\nAnd I don't really buy into that as an ethical question. The idea that she's using him because she laid out the facts of her situation and asked him -- a person who is responsible for her existence but never paid to raise her -- to make a financial investment in her future.\n\nThis has nothing to do with BLAME. I cannot lay out the facts without pointing out that as much as he was never TOLD about her, he also never had to take responsibility, either. Now he's being asked to help her -- not compelled, asked -- and he's affronted.\n\nAnd yeah. I don't think he's to blame for not knowing her. But he's definitely responsible for how he's responding to it now.\n\nOh, regarding your question -- if that stranger was my biological child who I had never had to pay any amount of money for, now allowing me to have enough money that I could pay for their school without any meaningful inconvenience? Yes, I'd do it. In recognition that I have responsibility for them. Which only exists because of the DNA. You can't ignore that part. He's her father, not her cousin. He created her. That responsibility transcends other people's bad -- and even evil -- decisions. \n\nBut also, I did have a relative pop up in my life out of the absolutely clear blue sky (a full-blood sister, in fact) and I definitely cared more about her than OP seems to care about his daughter.

It sucks but that\u2019s the consequence of the mothers actions.", "But he isn't her Dad.", "She hid his child from him\u2026 how is that his fault enlighten me", "I see your point, partly. I shouldn't expect OP to suddenly start thinking like a parent - it's a skillset he hasn't practiced. But his 18 year old daughter isn't here looking for a blind date, is she? She's trying to meet, if not a functional parent at this point, the person who could or should have occupied that space. That's a messy headspace to be in. He says some conflicting things, to me, about his interest in a relationship with her, and they are mostly understandable, but if he DID want a relationship, as the older, presumably more mature person? I think it's a cheap shot for him to act surprised that her expectations are probably high.\n\nA teenager just met her dad for the first time, and he's not acting overjoyed. He's not rushing to fill any voids. He's not overflowing with emotions. He's not scrabbling to find ways to help her and be a part of her life. He's just a guy. It's not at all unfair of me to point out that he sounds severely lacking in all the characteristics of a teenager's fantasy of an absentee dad who was actually the good guy all along and now they can make up for all the pointlessly lost time. OP isn't evil for not being that fantasy person, but it's true he's not especially sympathetic to me from the tone of his post, and I'm upset at the idea of him not at least letting her down with compassion and understanding, instead of getting miffed and feeling superior about the college money.", "It was sarcasm", "Where I do come from, he would be obliged to pay retropsective child support. Plus pay support during the time she pursues whatever degree or formation she wants to go for.\nWhy is she supposed to reach out just for the relationship? That\u2019s not how child support works. He would have been obliged to pay regardless of the Status of their relationship because he would have been obliged to provide for her. \nI actually start to believe we are missing information here. \nIf they just wanted money from him, they could have gotten a lot more. Earlier. So was the mom afraid to contact him due to something? \nFurthermore, are there no inheritance rights in this country? I mean there\u2018s a paternity test. Wouldn\u2019t she get automatically a certain legal specified amount? So he can\u2018t wash himself of her.", "He said he could pay it without struggle. He's not in the US. Most places don't have the ridiculous university costs that the US has.", "This is just a sad opinion to have. Blame the parents, not the child.", "Thank you. Don't forget the virgins", "I'm not even an adult and can see how BS these n t a comments are, like \"yessss let's have no sympathy for the child you helped create who grew up without your presence!\" What a way to validate an AH.", "It just sucks that the child has to struggle because of both of her parents failed her. OP is not at fault for not knowing, but now he does and still doesn't feel any sympathy for the girl who grew without a father and a mom he knows is bitter.", "He's not in the US. Nowhere costs as much as the US for university.", "My brother found out he had a daughter when she was about 22. \nOur whole family welcomed her straight away. My brother also helped her financially straight away. \nMy mum was heartbroken to have missed out on seeing her granddaughter grow up, the minute mum found out they had a shared skill/hobby (dressmaking) my mum went out and bought her the best sewing machine and overlocker. \n\nWhen my dad (her grandfather) died only a year or so after meeting; she was included in the funeral like the immediate family member she is. \n\nNone of us ever felt like she was a stranger.", "OP doesn\u2019t want a relationship, he SAID SO. not interested. Her grades are fine, OP just doesn\u2019t wanna pay.\n\nYTA op."]}
