When she came to me she told me that she just wanted to get to know her father. I wasn't really interested in a relationship but felt it would be cruel and unnecessary to deny her this. We talked for a while and I didn't really say much it but it was interesting. So after we talk for a while I ask about her mother, \"Grace\" (40f) and she gives me her number. I really didn't want to have to call her but I needed answers.\n\nSo Grace and I  decided to meet up at a local coffee shop. We have some small talk for while before I ask her why she never told me. Silence. I ask again. Silence. I ask a third time and she told me that she just didn't want anything to do with and wanted to \"get back at me\". I point out that all she did deprive the  child of a father. She says she does. I ask her when did she tell Jane. She says at age 12. So I get confused and am wondering why she only contacts me now. So I ask her why. Grace says that she was angry that I wasn't present in her life. We talk some more about life before we say goodbye and go our separate ways. \n\nI don't ask Jane why she didn't call sooner because she was a hurting teen and that's life. So Jane and I spend the next week \"bonding\". Then she sits down and asks to talk. I say sure and sit down. Then she goes on to explain about how difficult her life was living in a single parent household and how money was always tight. Long story short she asks me to pay for her university fees. Now I am well off enough to pay for it without struggle. So I ask to see her grades and to be truly honest it's meh. Not bad but nothing to give a second look. I tell her that I'll think about it and she says thank you. \n\nSo here's where I might be the AH. I don't want to pay for the fees because, in reality, she is just a stranger with my DNA. And I feel like Jane might just be using me. I mean she has had 6 years to firm a relationship with me and is only doing now that she needs something. I just want to wash my hands clean of her and Grace and move on with my life. I don't want Jane to think I'm her financial lifeline or anything like that.\n\nSo, Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit to add some stuff because of the comments.\n\n1. I did a DNA test. It was what she wanted me to do to prove herself.\n\n2. Child support laws are different in my country in the sense that: A. You can't claim unclaimed child support if you had the option to claim it. B. Child support can't be settled after 18 unless the father knowingly disappeared and that would take months to process let alone prove.\n\n3. Jane had the ability to contact me. I don't know how much influence her mother had on her choice but I do know that I was a dial away.", "created_utc": 1681758503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pt41k/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_pay_for_my_childs/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grace is a tremendous AH to both of you.\n\nI do encourage you to seriously consider contributing to Jane's university expenses (not to say you should or should not contribute, just seriously and honestly consider it). Think about her position - no father in her life and a mother who won't answer any questions she has for the first 12 years - then who knows what context Grace gave her when she finally did tell her? I'll bet she never said \"I never told your father about you because I wanted to spite him and I didn't care what effect that had on your childhood,\" despite that being the truth, instead she undoubtedly made you into the bad guy. Jane had no way of knowing better, and you should be sympathetic to that.\n\nI don't think you're an AH no matter what you decide, just don't do anything to spite Jane, she's had enough of that already.", "NAH- she is a kid who just met her dad. University is the biggest thing on her mind and she says that dad has funds so why not ask.  \n\nI wouldn't if I was her but I get it. And you're not the A for thinking... hmm this is weird. If it was a year or two from now after yall have caught up so and formed a bond...   \n\nIt also sucks as you didn't get a shot but may have just gained a daughter. If it was me- I would've said let's reset and not have this convo now as we are strangers. Let's become familiar and we can talk way down the road on this topic.  \n\nBut yeah rock and a hard place for sure", "Hmmm.  NTA.. but contributing some part would be a good thing.\n\nI don't understand folks piling on you....it's not like you knew about Jane and ran off.  Yes, she was deprived of a father, but you were also deprived of a daughter.  Not sure why mom or daughter is angry at you for not being present.", "She was a teen who was manipulated by her mother.  I highly doubt the mother would have allowed her to reach out prior.\n\nI don't think you should fault your child for her mother's actions, especially if it won't put a strain on your resources.\n\nAlso, while her grades may be underwhelming, she still deserves a chance to have more opportunities. \n\nIf you are concerned about your relationship becoming strictly financial, I say have a conversation about it.", "NTA. And you are totally right, this is not about a relationship with you, but with your money.", "NTA but she is a kid that was raised by a woman who had a Vendetta against you. It means 18 years of poisoning (if you are sure that she is your dna) .\n\nI mean in her eyes you are this vilan and her mother is the hero.\n\nAsk your self this am i Willing to risk loosing x amount of money to the chance of having a child. If the answer is yes so you might do it if its no so don't do it", "NTA.\n\nYou were deliberately deprived of a relationship with your child. Now she/they (I'm assuming Grace probably pushed this on Jane) want money. That's just messed up, IMO.", "NTA at all for how you feel.\n\nFirstly, Im hoping you had a DNA test to be sure Jane is actually your child?\n\nSecondly, its understandable why Jane didnt contact you before, particularly as you dont know what Grace said to her about you (especially as Grace admitted that she wanted to get back at you) so it could be that she was 'talking smack' about you to Jane all this time.\n\nThirdly, its your choice whether or not to pay for Janes University fees, and I wouldnt call you the AHole for not doing so. However, you also never had to pay child support for Jane all these years (and be aware that some States do award retroactive child support, even when the parent had no knowledge of the child) so I would imagine University fees would be alot less than that. \n\nAdditionally if you choose not to help Jane financially, chances are nil to none that she would choose to have a relationship with you going forward. \n\nYou say (now) that you just want to wash your hands of her and Grace, but 10 years from now will that still be the case?\n\nEither way, its your choice and Im not going to judge you poorly either way.", "NTA. She calls you when she needs money, not when she first got your number. Tell her you want to know her more before paying(ask her to do a gap year), and if she gets angry or drops contact with you, then you have your answer. If she gives you the time of day, pay the school directly so she can't touch the money.", "NTA but I'd you do decide to give or lend her money I recommend talking to a lawyer first.", "NTA. \n\n> she is just a stranger with my DNA\n\nYup. And one that wants to use you as a piggybank, no less.", "NTA, she only sought you out for money. I don't think she would have looked for you without needing money. She's spent all these years hating you and possibly being poisoned against you. She's not looking for a warm, fuzzy father/ daughter relationship.", "NTA. But one option might be to gift a lump sum, doesn\u2019t have to be huge, for her to use for expenses. If you spend some time getting to know her and decide you want to help. But I would also be direct and ask her why now?  It is ok to be clear that you feel like her reaching out is about the money, and see how she responds and then decide how to move forward", "NTA.\n\nHer grades may be underwhelming, but then, her choice of college may be (should be) as well - she cannot be planning on Harvard or something like that. If you are interested in bonding with her, it should be first on her plans for study / life; help with getting there on her own (student loans? housing? jobs?). Great topics to hash out over coffee, or lunch ...  I can imagine even something like \"I might help with paying back a part of your study loans upon graduation\" - which also implies staying cordial for four years. \n\nAs soon as she is unreasonable in her requests (demanding money, while she has **zero** to expect!!), the relationship will lapse, and she will have gotten  nothing. If she stays reasonable, maybe you will end up with a daughter, and she might end up with a father.", "NTA but the mother seems to be an AH, but we also don't know the full story.  \n\nI have two friends where something similar this has happened one found out about 20 years ago, the other 18 months ago. Ironically also daughters. \n\nThey have both formed relationships with their children and both are really glad that they did. \n\nIf you ever want to have a relationship with Jane, you should pay for her university, she didn't choose this scenario and it sounds like her mother is out for revenge on you, and has been feeding your daughter stories. Don't burn that bridge, it's been a shock to the system give it time to process. Maybe say to Jane - you will pay the first semester / year and see how you go from there - that will give you time to process.", "Wait, so Grace purposely kept OP and Jane apart, but she\u2019s mad at OP for not being involved in Jane\u2019s life?\n\nNTA. Was all fine and good to keep OP in the dark until they needed something. They don\u2019t get to be mad at OP for not being there for Jane when she was kept a secret.", "NTA. I had struggling parents and took out loans and worked during school. It wasn\u2019t ideal compared to having someone just pay for my school but I did what I had to and it worked out.\n\nIf you want yo get to know Jane you could offer to help in a small way such as helping her get a loan or assistance with small fees like books or application fees for community college.  Set expectations such as reevaluating your agreement each semester.  Also be honest and tell her your afraid that your being taken advantage of and see what she says. \n\nThe only flip side to any of this is had her mom filed for child support you coulda been on the hook for that.  She made the choice to not do that and could have made life easier for Jane and given you the chance to know her earlier.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants your money, not you.", "Cutting her out of your life because she dared ask for money would absolutely be an AH move. There isn't a ton else you can do as a father at this point of your lives.\n\nAnd you don't have to just give the cash btw, you can e.g. structure it as a long term 0 interest loan with maybe some percentage being a performance dependent gift (since you asked for grades seems like this is smth you'd like).", "NTA. I\u2019d ask for a paternity test.", "NAH except Grace. Grace lied to you and Jane; she caused this entire situation. \n\nJane...I don't blame her for not reaching out until now. From what you've written, it does not sound like Grace would have supported her in contacting you and Jane was a child. \n\nUni fees...tbh I'd see that as getting off lightly given you never had to pay child support. Entirely Grace's fault, but as usual the child is the one who suffers.", "This is a NAH situation. You're going to have to think about this situation and do what's morally right for yourself. I would personally be conflicted as well this is just a stranger with your DNA but it wasn't the child's fault at all so there is no clear moral direction.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are right, she is a stranger who you share DNA with. This is neither of your faults, it's her mother's.\n\nIt is suspicious they are just now coming to see you when they want something.", "NTA, but if it occurs to you to pay for school, make her prove herself first through community college first.  The thing I find odd is that in not knowing whether you\u2019d pay for school, her grades aren\u2019t so great.  You\u2019d think she\u2019d really be trying for scholarships if she knows her mom can\u2019t fund it.", "NTA. Not trying to say she\u2019s trying to use you, but if I were in her shoes, I would not be asking for money.", "NTA - she only looked for you because she needed money", "NTA her mother deprived her of a father, and you of a child.  If she was struggling so much as a single mother, she could have made you aware of Jane and requested child support.\n\nIt's suspicious that you were only contacted now, when they're faced with university costs.  I don't feel you are obligated to provide that, regardless of your financial standing.  Don't be surprised if Grace goes after back payments of support though, especially if you now have a confirmed DNA test.", "NAH,\n\nSo the whole circumstance of this is kinda odd. Though even if she only met up with you to ask for money, I can hardly blame her, college is expensive and loans can be pretty aggressive. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you, though maybe I\u2019d do a loan with no interest because she does have your blood and maybe she\u2019s being genuine.", "NTA. She is using you.  She is also not very good at it. A proper user would have hooked you for at least several months.  It is up to you to determine if stranger with your DNA deserves a support", "NTA but neither is jane but i do think you should help jane out its not her fault she never had a relationship with you its the mothers fault but i dont think she should be deprived of her education especially if youre well off like you said.", "NTA\n\nYou handled all of this really maturely. This is your money we are talking about, you owe nothing to technically a stranger with your DNA (your words)\n\nShe had 6 years to seek you out, and she chooses to do so when she needs financial help. Tell her to ask her mum why is it that she was raised in a single parent family. \n\nIt's your decision if you do choose to seek a relationship with her, but don't let them guilt trip you into paying. \n\nShe's an adult. And her mum is the one at fault here, not you.", "NTA. Grace sucks. Jane I'm leaning towards being an AH too but not sure, but it sounds super fishy to me that she could've contacted you years ago and then asks you the second time she meets you for tuition help.\n\nAs a gesture I might make some kind of contribution but... Idk, I'd try to find a way to try and figure out the nature of your relationship before you do, just so things are clear.", "NTA\n\nMy gut feeling is she has no interest in establishing a relationship with you. She just wants your money. I would not feel any obligation to pay for her university fees or for anything else. If either of you want to try to establish a relationship, that has to start from ground zero, and it can't start with asking for money. I'd suggest telling her that you would like to be a part of her life and to get to know her. Suggest the two of you meet for dinner once a month and see how she reacts. If all she is interested in is asking for money, for school, for rent, you will have your answer. If she genuinely wants to form a relationship, then 5, 10 years down the road, you may feel differently about helping her.", "NTA but if I had the means I would it\u2019s an opportunity to know your kid", "I\"m gonna say NAH, but there's a lot of other things in your post that do make you an AH.\n\nShe was a 12 year old girl at the time.  You do not put adult responsibilities of forging a relationship with a strange man she's told is her father on a 12 year old girl and act like it's her own failing for not having six years of a relationship with you.  That is unfair to her and it really sounds like part of your reasoning is blaming her for that.  If you really need to place blame, then that's on her mother for putting the two of you in this position in the first place and not taking action to help facilitate a relationship, not the minor child.  No minor child should be contacting strangers on their own to engage in a parent-child (or any) relationship, and especially not when clearly not approved or facilitated by her custodial parent.\n\nI also think it's an asshole thing to look at (and judge) her grades as part of this decision making process.  Especially when it's pretty clear that you have no intention of paying regardless.  It just comes off as petty and superficial.\n\nSo, legally, you may not be obligated to do a damn thing.  And if you don't want to help her, that's certainly your right.  But please take the prior two things out of our reasoning for it because that treads dangerous close to AH territory.", "NTA imo", "NTA. But hear me out, why don\u2019t you give a lump sum as backlog child support to her and maybe wash your hands off this situation?? Make it a clear cut break so that she wont come back to you again.", "She knew at 12 and didn't want you in her life until it was time to pay for university.\n\n100% your choice, but NTA to not pay.", "Lol i can\u2019t believe the comments", "NTA\n\nShe is a Stranger. Why should you pay for a strangers uni?\nAlso yes she had it hard being raised alone, but thats on her mum not on you.\nShe could be any poor child without a dad, which sucks, you still have no obligation to pay though.", "NTA BUT if you can afford it and choose to id suggest that you pay the money directly to the school. You don\u2019t know that this is what they really want the money for. Don\u2019t become an ATM for either the mom or child.", "NTA. Jane's mother was immature and should have told you when she was pregnant, and gotten 18 years of child support for her daughter. Her selfish attitude is what left Jane with a low income household and no father figure. It sucks for you and Jane both, but unfortunately, you are kind of at a point where you have no legal obligation as a father, and your relationship with your adult daughter is up to you to dictate now.", "yta just help your kid you say you can afford it no problem don't be mean", "YTA - but only because you ask why Jane didn't seek you out sooner. She was a child until recently as far as the law is concerned.  It would require information from Grace to be able to find you and you've given no indication that Grace was forthcoming with that information.\n\nThat said, while she may be biologically your child she is not emotionally attached to you in any way.  You have to decide how you want to proceed from here, there are no wrong answers.", "YTA\nShe\u2018s struggling, she never had a father and while that may not be your fault because you didn\u2018t know, you do know now. It\u2018s up to you now if you want to make a change in her life and step up for her, or to let her down. I would say that how you will respond to this is gonna deeply reflect your values. Will you just carry on with your life and act like nothing happend and blend out the fact that you have a child who wishes for a protecting father and you activly refuse to step up? How would you want to be treated? How would you, as a child, wish to be treated? And are you going to act like the father you would want?", "YTA, for your actions and for making yourself look like a victim. You fathered a child without even knowing, and your reaction to this isn\u2019t horror at unintentionally dropping a kid into the world and doing nothing to care for it, but also to seek to blame everyone but yourself?\n\nAt the very least, check the rules around financing college. You didn\u2019t say what country you\u2019re in, but if it\u2019s like mine, then both parents are expected to contribute no matter what the custody situation is. And because of that expectation, students themselves are strictly limited on how much they can get in loans, unless they obtain official paperwork proving they have a deadbeat parent. \n\nSo first, helping with university is the practically least you can do, considering 18 years of doing nothing. And second, the very least you can do is cooperate with your kid in whatever she needs to prove you have never and will never give her any money.", "NTA. Grace is definitely the AH. I would suggest getting to know your bio daughter more and see if she genuinely wants a relationship or just someone to bankroll her education which based on timing, is definitely a concern.", "NTA, but whatever the history is, the fact is she is your daughter and she was deprived of having a father for the important years of her life (no fault of yours)\n\nI believe you should help her out, especially if it\u2019s not going to cause you any financial difficulty.", "NTA that\u2019s not your child.\n\nOh you might have provided dna, but the other contributor made sure this wasn\u2019t your kid. \n\nThis person is a stranger you happen to be related to, you don\u2019t owe them anything.", " NTA, your daughter's mother is a huge one though,  and thank your lucky stars you're not in the US. A friend of mine only found out he had a child when a family member that works in the court system in their home town called him to inform him there was a warrant out for him over $30,000 in back child support. Turns out the mother was well aware that the child was his but had been passing the child off as someone else's and when they split decided to file...after 5 years.", "If she turns out to be your child, your feeling might change. You might be like this because you're not sure and just stringing along.\n\nUpon confirmation, you might become passionate about her future and the passion might become contagious and infect her. \n\nNevertheless, if no such passion develops, you are obliged to pay her school fees, even if you think she's exploiting you. Let her know you'll feel bad if she's exploiting you but you'll still be there for her.\n\nWhy not pay for her to travel another country for a short holiday?

When she came to me she told me that she just wanted to get to know her father. I wasn't really interested in a relationship but felt it would be cruel and unnecessary to deny her this. We talked for a while and I didn't really say much it but it was interesting. So after we talk for a while I ask about her mother, \"Grace\" (40f) and she gives me her number. I really didn't want to have to call her but I needed answers.\n\nSo Grace and I  decided to meet up at a local coffee shop. We have some small talk for while before I ask her why she never told me. Silence. I ask again. Silence. I ask a third time and she told me that she just didn't want anything to do with and wanted to \"get back at me\". I point out that all she did deprive the  child of a father. She says she does. I ask her when did she tell Jane. She says at age 12. So I get confused and am wondering why she only contacts me now. So I ask her why. Grace says that she was angry that I wasn't present in her life. We talk some more about life before we say goodbye and go our separate ways. \n\nI don't ask Jane why she didn't call sooner because she was a hurting teen and that's life. So Jane and I spend the next week \"bonding\". Then she sits down and asks to talk. I say sure and sit down. Then she goes on to explain about how difficult her life was living in a single parent household and how money was always tight. Long story short she asks me to pay for her university fees. Now I am well off enough to pay for it without struggle. So I ask to see her grades and to be truly honest it's meh. Not bad but nothing to give a second look. I tell her that I'll think about it and she says thank you. \n\nSo here's where I might be the AH. I don't want to pay for the fees because, in reality, she is just a stranger with my DNA. And I feel like Jane might just be using me. I mean she has had 6 years to firm a relationship with me and is only doing now that she needs something. I just want to wash my hands clean of her and Grace and move on with my life. I don't want Jane to think I'm her financial lifeline or anything like that.\n\nSo, Reddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And based on how the relationship grows, you can make a better call down the line about whether she wants a relationship with you or not and how that makes you feel about supporting her.", "Could you support her through community college and see what her grades look like then?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI would be worried about their intentions too. If you agree to pay you should definitely make sure that you pay the university directly so they are not going to use the money for something else.", "NTA. It looks like in your country, you're not obligated to pay for your daughter. If you wish to help her out, please consider paying the university directly. You don't have to pay the entire amount, of course, but for your own peace of mind, pay whatever you're planning to give directly to the school.

But I do think by denying or saying no, it will essentially just cut your relationship with Jane. \n\nSo, I guess it comes down to, do you want any semblance of a relationship? Perhaps contributing a small amount (not a full university fee but like some sort of financial support) might be enough of an olive branch to jumpstart a relationship. You refer to her as a stranger with your DNA, in which case, I'm inclined to say that you're probably leaning towards denying financial support for uni, and just going back to normal without the knowledge that you're actually a dad.", "NTA and as much as Jane may suffer for it, don\u2019t give her any money. She had 6 years of knowing you were related and refused to have anything to do with you, and now conveniently only wants a relationship when she needs something.

She wanted to have nothing to do with you, so keep it that way.", "NTA\n\nInstead of just giving her the money, could loan it to her instead. It could have generous terms and no interest, and/or a stipulation that she maintain a certain GPA. You could also add in conditions for the loan to be forgiven, or income based repayment. It would be a much better deal than she\u2019d get from a bank or private lender. So while she\u2019d still graduate with \u201cdebt\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be crushing.\n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to pay for anything, but I think the real AH here is her mom who disadvantaged her own child out of spite.", "NTA.  I don't think Jane is, either. Grace, on the other hand, is total TAH. She didn't tell you \"to get back at you\"??  Really? How'd that work out for you, Grace, huh?

She's an adult, now, but she has 18 years of her mom in her head.  \nIf you had known about her (let's just say) and paid child support, would it be close, do you think, to what her college would cost?  \nJane may keep asking you for money, but then again she may not. She may want you to pay for her education because you weren't there for her growing up, knowing intellectually that you had nothing to do with that, not having known about her. But still, and possibly with her mother's urging, she wants something from you.\n\nIt is your choice on whether to pay for her college. If you do, I would make it clear you are not a bank. I would make it clear that IF any monies are given in the future, it is dependent on you two having some kind of regular contact/relationship. You work out what that could mean. Those are just suggestions for you. Good luck.", "NTA but talk to Jane about how you didn't know about her until she came to you.

But as others have pointed out here, I don't think it's her fault that she didn't contact you after her mom told her about you.  Her mom almost certainly dissuaded her from doing so.\n\nMaybe you could help with a small portion of the cost to start, see her regularly, and if your relationship with her develops well, consider increasing the amount you contribute.\n\nAlso, even though her grades aren't great, maybe, along with the cash, you could give her some advice about choosing coursework that would help her make a living once she graduates and about the importance of trying hard to get good grades, as doing so will increase her opportunities in the future.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA but I wouldn't blame the 12 year old for not contacting you. This isn't a children's adventure film where children go on quests for their identity without any adult supervision. \n\nIf I was Grace, I wouldn't have let Jane contact you until now in case you reacted as you have done with indifference and rejection, although I would have been worried about anger directed at the child. \n\nI am in no way saying that Grace was right to keep this from you but she should have been the one to contact you if she wanted to do the reveal in childhood.", "NAH but don't fault the kid for not calling.

Maybe money was so tight that she took jobs to buy necessities and her grades took the hit. No matter what, I think she deserves a chance. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d set limits such as, maintain certain grades and keep your nose clean. See what grades scholarships demand when setting the grade limit so it\u2019s on par with what her peers would have to maintain.  \n\nAlso, talk to your daughter about her long term plans and let her know that she can change her plans, so long as there is a plan.
