{"id": 19411, "submission_id": "145dxyr", "title": "AITA for not wanting to spend my birthday with my in-laws?", "selftext": "It was my (27f) birthday a week ago. My husband planned a dinner date to celebrate on the day of my birthday. I had told him previously that that was exactly how I preferred spending my birthday. I didn\u2019t need any real gifts, just a nice dinner date. I\u2019ve also previously asked him to plan more dates for us since it\u2019s a good way for him to make me feel loved, cared for, and heard (I\u2019m usually the one who has to plan dates and find new restaurants, and sometimes I\u2019d like for that to be done for me). We didn\u2019t really have the whole day since we both work, but I was excited to have a nice evening together, especially since this was the first birthday we were going to celebrate as husband and wife (I\u2019m a pretty sentimental person and love commemorating special days). \n\nThe problem occurred when I got a phone call from my MIL and told me she and my husband\u2019s family were going to be coming over on the evening of my birthday. I told her that my husband and I had plans that evening and she said \u201cOh, I already talked to him and he said he\u2019ll move the dinner reservation to a different day.\u201d \n\nNow here\u2019s where I felt extremely hurt. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve asked my husband to talk to me before changing our plans or creating boundaries between his family and us (because I\u2019ve created boundaries between my family and us), but it just doesn\u2019t seem to get through to him. I\u2019ve cried, I\u2019ve yelled, I\u2019ve asked calmly. I\u2019ve told him how much it hurts my feelings, I\u2019ve told him it makes me unhappy. And each time he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, I\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d But I\u2019ve heard that from him on at least 15 different occasions and I haven\u2019t seen much change. Not to mention how many times I\u2019ve asked him to discuss with me if plans are being changed. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t mind celebrating my birthday with my in-laws. They\u2019re great people and I actually love them. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I prefer that over a romantic dinner date with my husband. I would\u2019ve been happy celebrating with them on another day. But I didn\u2019t even get to have a say in how I wanted to celebrate my birthday. My husband changed our plans because his mom asked him to and he didn\u2019t discuss it with me at all. It just hurts me that he can\u2019t seem to do what I\u2019ve asked of him. \n\nI spoke to him about it and he claimed, \u201cyou don\u2019t know my mom, she\u2019s really difficult and stubborn. She wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer.\u201d I asked him if he made it clear to his mom how important this dinner date was to us and he shrugged and said that he hadn\u2019t really thought to do that. Which of course makes me think he didn\u2019t really think the dinner date was important. \n\nMy husband can\u2019t seem to keep his promises. Im not sure if I\u2019m being unreasonably angry at him. I\u2019ve told him in the past that he\u2019s going to slowly lose me if he can\u2019t keep his promises. Am I being dramatic over the fact that I had to spend my birthday with my in-laws?
