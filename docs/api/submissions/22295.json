There are times when cursing/shouting is justified, and throwing rocks at animals is one of them. (Stepping into traffic, wielding weapons, drive bing without licence\u2026 there IS a list). This behaviour had to stop. NOW. Sooner or later they\u2019ll injure an animal. Sooner or later they may mess with the wrong animal and get injured themselves (dogs, cows, horses \u2026 and god forbid, bears). The parents and zoo staff were AHs for not stopping them sooner.", "NTA\n\nThe parents, followed by zoo staff, are the ones responsible for the behavior of the children and the safety of the animals. It's frustrating that any of it fell to you and your reaction, while intense, was fine in my opinion. If the parents don't want their children yelled at by strangers, take responsibility for them. If the zoo staff don't want scenes, how about they diffuse situations before they involve physically assaulting the animals.\n\nI'm tired of people judging the reactions of others more harshly than they judge their own inaction. Useless, the lot of them.", "NTA, sometimes it just comes down to parenting other peoples' kids in these situation. Animal abuse isn't okay and everybody else is TA because they were basically condoning it.", "You did good! Somebody has to protect the animals,  since they can\u2019t do it themselves. I wish I had the courage to speak up during moments like that. Definitely NTA!!", "NTA. But everyone else is. Shame on the parents AND zoo staff to allow an animal be abused. Children can learn from a young age to be kind to animals.", "NTA. I would have been cursing too! The zoo employee had an obligation to protect the bears and they did nothing. The parents have an obligation to discipline their children. You spoke up and good for you!", "NTA but maybe next time instead of swearing, just start throwing rocks at the kids and ask them how they like it when people throw rocks at them", "NTA. Throwing rocks and hitting an animal in the head is abuse, and the bear was essentially trapped in an enclosure and can't get away. You stopped them from harassing and abusing an animal. I'm sure it was the first time anyone told those kids off.", "NTA. Someone needed to protect these animals. Those children who were throwing rocks were old enough to know better, but apparently were not ever taught that abusing animals is totally unacceptable. You did good. It takes a village to raise a child.", "ESH, including the zoo staff. You absolutely made a scene in that zoo, and yelled at someone else\u2019s kid that you don\u2019t even know. On a positive note those kids probably won\u2019t do that again.", "Sad thing is if the kids were throwing rocks at an object - say mom's car - as opposed to a living, breathing thing thing, bet those kids would have been snatched up, stopped, and disciplined right quick! People suck but you do not. Thank you for stepping in. NTA", "NTA. If their parents disciplined their kids properly then you wouldn't have had to say anything in the first place. Good work!", "ESH. \n\nThe parents did a bad job at dealing with their kids, the staff did a bad job of protecting their animals and you did a bad job, you work with kids so I'm surprised you got to the point of swearing at them AND getting into a slinging match with the mum. No heroes here.", "ESH\n\nThe children for throwing rocks at animals.\n\nThe parents for not stopping their children.\n\nThe zoo staff member for not saying anything or intervening.\n\nYou for ye olde fashioned misogyny when you said \u201cWhat sort of mother brings her children to the Zoo just so they can abuse the animals?\u201d when the dad was right there being just as ineffective.\n\nAny onlookers who suggested you throw the kids in.", "NTA.  That mother never told them to stop, she was just trying to save face since she got called out on it.", "NTA. If you take your kids out in public you have to be ready to control them. If the parents were parenting at the time, yeah stay out of it or if no one was being harmed yeah keep quiet. But as no one was doing anything and an animal was being harassed yes speak up and no apology needed. That poor bear deserves someone to stick up for him.", "NTA. Poor bears.", "Animal abuse is disgusting in any way shape or form, and you did the kids parents' job by telling them to stop. If they are gonna let their kids be unruly and cruel they need to be set straight as well as their kids, and most definitely should not be taking them to a zoo. \n\nBut \"throw the kids in?\" I mean c'mon, that's a little far. It's unacceptable behaviour but it's AH behaviour from the kids as a result of shitty parenting, and to suggest they deserve to be thrown in and mauled to death is ridiculous.\n\nAll aside, the kids and the parents earned the criticism, and hopefully they will be banned from the zoo.\n\nEveryone su cks here apart from you, NTA.", "NTA.  Holy shit, it sounds like you were the only adult present with their brain fully engaged....", "NTA. That mother lied or something cuz there ain't no way on this spinning ball of dirt that she even came close to disciplining her kids right.\nHell, you did a public service. Good on you.", "I think it\u2019s AH behavior to cuss at kids. You could have gotten the point across without cussing. But the bear needed them to stop.", "Yes, throwing rocks at kids is way better than using the F bomb.\n/s", "Perhaps put the parents in a pit and lob stones at them instead ;-)", "Yeah if he hadn't gone straight to dropping an F-bomb on the kids and taking a below the belt swipe at the mom, I'd be on board. Something tells me he won't last long in his job..", "And YTA for immediately boiling it down to misogyny when it was the mother who engaged him. Resulting in OP responding directly to her. Get over yourself.", "Yeah, but the mom spoke to him. He was talking to her.", "That's a real conundrum for y'all isn't it what's more important the delinquents feelings, or the trapped animal", "Can confirm parents say a lot worse things than just the word fuck both around and towards their kids. Cussing doesn\u2019t make someone an asshole especially when it involves animal abuse", "I asked nicely the first time. Shouldn't need to repeat myself while parents watch their kids engage in animal abuse.", "Sounds like an updated version of The Lottery!", "Yet it was both parents standing there", "You work with kids, so is that the attitude and reaction at work?\nSurely you're used to addressing the parents of children that misbehave. So instead of swearing at the kids, why wouldn't you think to say something to the parents \"hey, I'm concerned that your kids are going to hurt the animals, I don't think you've seen that they keep throwing rocks. \" \nI'm sure you often have to be very diplomatic in how you share your concerns while working, so it seems really weird that after asking nicely the first time, you'd go straight into swearing.", "You can be firm without resorting to cursing a child out.", "Seems like at that point just talk to the parent? What you did was definitely overkill", "Also the fact you work with kids and thought this is okay is disturbing", "Which should be pretty standard for someone who works with kids.", "If the animal abuse is stopped first.  If you wanted him to be firm without cursing, he would have had to PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN THE KIDS and then talk to them firmly without cursing.\n\nSometimes you have to escalate off the get-go.  This was clearly one of those situations.  Would you rather let the BEARS handle this??????????????", "It's just a word. A child actively *abusing an animal* can handle the word \"fuck.\"", "Yeah, and the way i work with kids is very different than the way i treat animal abusers. Just like I can turn off and on my \"dad\" voicr when I need to discipline children. Cursing at the kids was for the parents, not the kids. The parents clearly didn't care that a stranger was talking to their kids until the stranger started cursing.", "Are you stupid? You don\u2019t have to hit a kid to get your point across, nor use obscene language. People do it every day. Look at me, not cussing at your ignorance. Too easy to not cuss at a small child.", "Who said anything about hitting a kid?  I said the kids needed to be stopped, instantly.  IF that takes physical restraint or cussing, so be it.  I'm glad it did not take physical restraint.  But I can't condemn someone cussing in the situation.  It worked.  And something had to be done.", "Putting your hands on a person is not required. If he felt so offended, then go to an employee. It\u2019s not his place.", "The employee was fully aware of what was happening, and NOT DOING ANYTHING TO STOP IT.", "Then tell them to do something! HOLY Hell, you\u2019re fucking dense. Go the fuck away."]}
