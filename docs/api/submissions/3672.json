Your parents should ofcourse receive rent and because you aren't working he should pay them. Your husbands gets a rental house for a great price because of the kindness of his in-laws. The way i see it he should be grateful as hell that he \"only\" has to pay the rent your parents asked. I wouldn't even have to think about this if i were him. Could it be that he resents you for not working? Either way i feel like your husband isn't letting you know how he really feels, what is his real issue?", "NTA but maybe think whether you and your husband can work on resolving your finance/expenses frictions now so they are not an issue that keeps occurring in the future? It's common for married couples to have shared finances but that doesn't have to be the case for you if that's not what you both want. But working together on how you can manage your finances/expenses as equitably as possible might be what you need to do at this moment. Your husband simply refusing to pay rent does't help at all so finding a space where these issues can be discussed by both of you it's important. Maybe consider a couples' counsellor?", "NTA, your husband is, your parents are already renting it out below market price.", "NTA\n\nIf I were you I would simply say if you're not willing to pay the rent here then we need to move to let your parents rent to someone else.  If he says no, well it's either he pay rent of get the hell out.", "does he think he is inmune to eviction?", "NTA. Not paying rent is not a choice he gets to make. Those are the conditions to living there. Don't cave just because he is trying to control you by giving you the silent treatment. Damn straight he has a huge character flaw. Don't stay with arrogant men.", "NTA - You live in someone's home then you have to vpay them rent. I would tell them that if he doesn't pay them rent then you will be forced to move (because technically this should be true since their only income is the rent) and that you guys would have to pay more expensive rent elsewhere. He needs to quit acting entitled and pay the rent which as you stated is far less than he would have to pay for somewhere else. Does he want to pay $1000 rent or $400.", "NTA\n\nYou make a clear, concise, and very valid statement.  \n\nYour husband, TA, and sounds completely entitled with a definite character flaw.\n\nYou need to be ready to stand by your statement.", "NTA. Your husband is. How disgusting. Kick him out. See if you can move in with your parents until you get a new job so they can rent the house to someone else at market value.", "NTA.

Yes, the only reason we live here is because we pay half of what we'd pay anywhere else.

He doesn't get a say to just stop paying rent. If he's willing to take advantage of OP's parents, he's willing to take advantage of her.

You both will be evicted and it will be very hard to rent somewhere else, especially at anything like that rent, which is very very cheap. He is thinking your parents will be too lenient/old/feeble to do anything about it. He is thinking their kinship to you will allow him to get away with it. You are very correct to see this is a big problem with his character.", "He does understand that your parent don't need to rent to y'all & could rent it out and make more money?

Does he think you'll have a job by then to be able to continue paying it?", "NTA\n\nIf he isn't paying rent there, he can go pay more rent alone somewhere else. You already get a break on rent, and you'll eventually inherit the properties if they're not sold before your parents pass. If your marriage survives this cheapskate behavior, ensure you are the only one on any property titles and do not let him try to convince you that anything you inherit is marital property or to make it marital property. Once his name goes on anything, there is no going back.", "NTA.  Hubby is sounding pretty entitled here.  Your parents are giving you a big break on the amount of rent and he's pretty ungrateful for that.  Your parents should tell him that if he doesn't pay rent, then you and hubby can find another place to live.", "NTA. He is not entitled to free rent no matter who owns the property. You supported him, now he needs to support you until you find another job. Including paying rent. \n\nYour parents need to serve him with an eviction notice as soon as the rent is due if he has not paid.

He doesn't seem to have actually given you one.   \n Especially since the rent SO cheap!  It sounds like you've both been there for each other and picked up the slack every time one couldn't work, why is he changing that now?\n\nRent needs to be paid, no matter what.  But especially because it's so below market value, it's likely just covering your parents' expenses on the property (taxes, insurance, maintenance) so why should they house you for free, at their expense?", "He does understand that your parent don't need to rent to y'all & could rent it out and make more money?", "He needs to find somewhere else for HIMSELF to live.

So not only is he not paying your half, he's now trying to get out of paying *his* half.", "NTA\n\nYou can't just stop paying rent because the owners are his in-laws! Your husband is way out of line, and he's going to end up homeless.", "NTA. Is this man enhancing your life or making it worse?", "He can pull that on his own parents if they're cool with it. Your parents need the money and he is using their real estate. Pay up. You have it at such a discounted price he'd be mad not to pay. If you get kicked out good luck finding somewhere that cheap", "NTA. You have an agreement. Tell your husband if he wants to live in this house rent is required because you're parents legally can and will evict him over it. If he refuses again tell him then we gotta find a new house because my parents will kick us out.\n\nTell him not to be that nightmare tenant who uses the toxic family excuse to not pay what he owes. 400 monthly rental is cheap no matter where you are anywhere and he wants to shoot himself in the foot and not pay? Shove your lease in his face and show him where it says he pays 400/month in exchange to live there, and have your parents tell him if he skips payment in Jan, he can expect an eviction notice on his door by February. Hell I'd contact the sheriff about him myself and just put his name alone on the eviction notice.", "This feels like one of those 90 day fiance scenarios where the US husband is a loser and the wife ends up doing all the work and constantly apologizing and running interference for his general douchebaggery.  Is he worth, it, OP?  I'm assuming he has some good qualities not outlined here, but this is truly impressive cheapness on his part, particularly since he's been completely supported for so long.
