I\u2019m a single dad. My wife sadly died of breast cancer around 2 years ago. My daughter was only 6 when this happened, and the grief process is tough. But, I guess I can say after 2 years I\u2019m finally coming to terms with her death.\n\nAnyways, my daughters birthday was yesterday. She\u2019s now a 9 year old. \n\nMy daughter told me that she wanted a very pretty pink cake. I told her that I would definitely be making her one.\n\nI have never baked in my life before. I usually buy store bought cakes for birthdays but I wanted this one to be special since she requested it. I should also mention that friends and family were coming over for her birthday.\n\nIt was hell trying to bake that cake. I know I\u2019m not that great of a cook but Jesus Christ I\u2019m a bad baker. I ended up throwing out about 5 cakes because I couldn\u2019t get the measurements right. At this point, I was wasting ingredients and it was getting pretty late and I knew guests would be arriving soon. I didn\u2019t know what to do at that point so I searched up a quick cookie recipe because I figured that would be easier than cakes. I found a simple sugar cookie recipe and managed to make it without messing it up too bad. I made sure to add in pink food coloring and added sprinkles on top though, just to fulfill her requests at least a little bit.\n\nSo, cookies are done. Guests are here. Party\u2019s thriving. The time finally comes to sing happy birthday. My daughter is sitting expectantly at the end of the table and is telling everyone she\u2019s so excited for her pretty pink cake. Imagine her disappointment when I walk out with a tray full of cookies. I lit some candles though so she could still have the experience.\n\nI set the cookies down in front of her and when she looked up at me her sad expression broke me. She asked me where was the pretty pink cake and I told her that I tried my best to make it but this was the only thing I made without messing up. She burst into tears and everybody was staring at me like I had two heads. \n\nShe calmed down and ended up eating the cookies and blowing out the candles though. I thought everything was fine but when she was going to bed she told me she really wanted a pretty pink cake. I told her I was sorry and that I would try my hardest to make her one next time. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning. My sister who was at the party texted me and said that it was selfish of me to not keep trying to make the cake and that I crushed my daughters dreams and she\u2019ll remember this forever. I still haven\u2019t responded to this message because I don\u2019t know how to react to this. I\u2019m feeling pretty heartbroken right now. Is it true that she\u2019ll remember this forever? I\u2019m scared that my daughter will resent me for not making her the cake. She did get very upset about it. It\u2019s starting to really make me wish my wife was still here. Because I know she would reassure me, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve done something wrong.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling confused right now.

I get trying from scratch, but after the second fail, why not just go the east route?", "Couldn't you have gotten a store bought cake, atleast after 3 failed tries, as a safety option or ordered a cake, and made cookies if you personally wanted to make something so there were options and she wouldn't get upset?", "Kind of YTA. You sort of promised her that she would have a cake. Take it as a lesson learnt. Don\u2019t wait until the day of to try and bake a cake! Next time, try a few weeks before, get her to help you, kids her age tend to enjoy helping to bake.

Like a dyed sponge cake with red fruits on top or something similarly simple?\n\nHindsight is 20/20 and I don't think you're selfish for trying but damn you sure were unorganised.\n\nThat being said, I'm sure your daughter is alright. You apologised, shit happens.", "Soft AH, OP. \n\nYou were needlessly stubborn, OP. She might have been *a little bit* disappointed that you didn't make it, versus *massively* disappointed not to have the cake she dreamed of. \n\nIn fact, you could have nailed a home-run with this: bought her one she wanted, explained why you did (teaching her an important lesson about setbacks and finding alternatives, and you could have offered that the two of you could practice cake baking together.\n\nYou can still win by doing exactly this: buy her the cake she wants (Easter is a good excuse or find another), talk to her about it so she knows it wasn't a snub, and then suggest you two practice baking cakes together (starting with simple cakes and building from there). That would be a win for you both.", "A gentle YTA...if you know you arent a baker you shouldve got one made...even a relatively cheapie  shop bought one you couldve \"pinked up\" and made pretty, if a specially made one was too expensive for you.  You went out of your way to ask your daughter what she wanted, promised it to her, then let her down in front of  everyone.  Yu get marks for trying, but common sense should have told you to try your hand at baking sooner than the night before the birthday, if it was something you hadnt attempted before.\n\nI have to add, I find your comment of \"I wish my wife was still here to reassure me\" a bit odd.  It sounds as if you are keen to receive sympathy rather than really wondering  AITA", "YTA soft - don\u2019t promise to kids if you can\u2019t keep them. There was no need to wait until the last minute to find out you can\u2019t bake a cake. I bet she wouldn\u2019t have cared it was bad anyway so long as it was pink.

You should have bought the cake after the first failure.  Five cakes?  What in Gordon Ramsey's name were you thinking?\n\nWill your daughter be traumatized by this?  No, probably not.

Take it as a lesson learnt.  Next time, order a damn cake.  You are NTA cause you genuinely tried.   Next time you promise your daughter something, don't assume you can do it if you never have before when a time line is involved.", "Mild YTA.

This sounds like a very normal parenting mistake and you clearly were trying to do the right thing here. Maybe as a thought for next year, you can try *buying* her the cake, but *making* her something, as well. It's not like she and her party guests wouldn't enjoy both. For now, you can still buy her a birthday cake and let her have a few friends over without having another party. No, it won't be the same, but I think at her age, she'll appreciate it and it'll turn this into a funny story for her when she's older.\n\nThat stated, I also think your sister *way* overreacted. Giving her cookies instead of a cake may have bummed your daughter out, but you didn't ruin the kid's life.", "YTA", "Lesson learned\u2026soft YTA. Should\u2019ve just went a got a cake.

Why did it have to be made from scratch when easier options exist???", "Why couldn\u2019t you just bite the bullet and buy her one pink cake with sprinkles on it? Just one, for this one special day?\n\nAlso I fail to see how you could fail at measurement\u2019s for making a cake - but successfully complete a plate of cookies. Baking is still baking. \n\nYTA", "YTA- but you can make it up to her. Bring her to pick a cake mix, and icing and all the fixings.

I usually buy store bought cakes for birthdays but I wanted this one to be special since she requested it.\n\nI do not understand. She requested a pretty pink cake, not the homemade. Why did you decided to make it yourself? Or did you hope to outperform professional bakers (or anyone who had already baked some cakes)? \n\nYou could have ordered custom cake from the bakery, asked you family to help. Even if you was 100% sure you had to bake the cake yourself,  you should have checked if you could actually bake it before the birthday (and understood that you can not and chose one of the other options).  \n\nYTA", "YTA why didn\u2019t you just buy one this is ridiculous", "Info: I think that\u2019s sweet you have her cookies but why didn\u2019t you go to a bakery or a grocery store they\u2019re good and cheap?

I\u2019m sure some of your guests would\u2019ve done that for you too. There\u2019s a reason the saying goes \u201cIt takes a village\u201d.

I say that gently because it sounds like you made a genuine effort to make your daughter the cake she wanted. However there were other ways you could have handled this; you said you\u2019ve never baked. Is there a friend or family member who bakes that could have helped you make it? If so you should have asked them for help. Otherwise you should have just bought the cake. At the very least you should have spoken with your daughter privately, explained your struggles with the cake, and that you made cookies instead.

Buy cake mix, they're available in pink and only require measuring out two things\n2. Buy a cake from a bakery, her only request was that the cake be pink, she didn't say you had to make it\n3.

Emergency plan B, call a responsible adult coming to the party and ask them to stop by any grocery story with a bakery or stand alone bakery and see what they have available for that day. You may have gotten lucky with a strawberry cake or maybe a red velvet and had some explaining to do but at least it would have been MUCH closer to what she asked for\n\nYou do none of these and then take the cowards way out by not even explaining to your daughter what happened so she could at least not be blindsided by disappointment. YTA!", "YTA after reading your responses. You half assed this whole attempt and you know it. You didn\u2019t replace the missing measuring cups, you just decided to wing it with spoons instead.

Your daughter just wanted a pink cake. There are so many alternative ways for you to have obtained a pink cake, and you failed to do the ONE THING she wanted because you had it in your head that making it from scratch mattered to her.\n\nYou need to learn that OUTCOMES matter.

You had the whole party and before it to tell her. She\u2019s 9, she understands. Instead you let her think it was coming, and disappointed her in front of all her friends.

Right up to that moment where she was going to blow out the candles, you let her believe she was going to get her pretty pink cake. I have to say, in all honesty I wouldnt have gotten to the stage where I made 5 cakes before giving up. Id have probably tried twice and then popped out to buy something, even a pink cup cake. You could have made a joke out of that in a look sweetie I tried and this was all I could manage, whilst giving everyone else your home made cookies. You shouldnt have left her thinking she had her cake though", "Soft YTA.\n\nDon't make promises you know you can't keep.  I know you tried, but obviously the effort didn't end up with the result you wanted.  Next time, just do boxed cake mix or have some sort of backup (after all, you did promise it).  Those are super easy and no one is gonna know you used a mix.  Also, you can make the cake ahead of time, so you're not cutting it so close. \n\nI'd try to make it up to her.  Next time is a whole year away, which is forever to kids.  Can you take her to a bakery and get her a fancy pink cupcake?  \n\nJust an idea for next time, maybe bake it with her.

From a box this time.", "YTA. Not for failing to make the cake, but for blindsiding her in front of everyone. You should have pulled her aside and privately explained what happened. She likely still would have been upset, but the sooner you told her, the sooner she\u2019d be able to process that. Instead, you allowed her to get gradually more excited and tell everyone about her pink cake. She was probably completely humiliated.\n\nThis could have been a good teaching moment for the fact that people don\u2019t succeed at things even when they try their best. It\u2019s probably not too late to salvage since this was yesterday, but you owe your daughter an apology.

Ok, you messed up on a number of fronts. You could have tried baking earlier rather than last minute. You could have gone to the store. You definitely should have told your daughter privately before the guests arrived. The latter borders on assholery. But having failed with a cake you made cookies.

I\u2019m a single dad. My wife sadly died of breast cancer around 2 years ago. My daughter was only 6 when this happened, and the grief process is tough. But, I guess I can say after 2 years I\u2019m finally coming to terms with her death.\n\nAnyways, my daughters birthday was yesterday. She\u2019s now a 9 year old. \n\nMy daughter told me that she wanted a very pretty pink cake. I told her that I would definitely be making her one.\n\nI have never baked in my life before. I usually buy store bought cakes for birthdays but I wanted this one to be special since she requested it. I should also mention that friends and family were coming over for her birthday.\n\nIt was hell trying to bake that cake. I know I\u2019m not that great of a cook but Jesus Christ I\u2019m a bad baker. I ended up throwing out about 5 cakes because I couldn\u2019t get the measurements right. At this point, I was wasting ingredients and it was getting pretty late and I knew guests would be arriving soon. I didn\u2019t know what to do at that point so I searched up a quick cookie recipe because I figured that would be easier than cakes. I found a simple sugar cookie recipe and managed to make it without messing it up too bad. I made sure to add in pink food coloring and added sprinkles on top though, just to fulfill her requests at least a little bit.\n\nSo, cookies are done. Guests are here. Party\u2019s thriving. The time finally comes to sing happy birthday. My daughter is sitting expectantly at the end of the table and is telling everyone she\u2019s so excited for her pretty pink cake. Imagine her disappointment when I walk out with a tray full of cookies. I lit some candles though so she could still have the experience.\n\nI set the cookies down in front of her and when she looked up at me her sad expression broke me. She asked me where was the pretty pink cake and I told her that I tried my best to make it but this was the only thing I made without messing up. She burst into tears and everybody was staring at me like I had two heads. \n\nShe calmed down and ended up eating the cookies and blowing out the candles though. I thought everything was fine but when she was going to bed she told me she really wanted a pretty pink cake. I told her I was sorry and that I would try my hardest to make her one next time. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning. My sister who was at the party texted me and said that it was selfish of me to not keep trying to make the cake and that I crushed my daughters dreams and she\u2019ll remember this forever. I still haven\u2019t responded to this message because I don\u2019t know how to react to this. I\u2019m feeling pretty heartbroken right now. Is it true that she\u2019ll remember this forever? I\u2019m scared that my daughter will resent me for not making her the cake. She did get very upset about it. It\u2019s starting to really make me wish my wife was still here. Because I know she would reassure me, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve done something wrong.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling confused right now.

Just let your daughter in on things so she has time and space to process her emotions in a safe space rather than having to fake it around a bunch of people. That would be hard for anyone of any age. It sounds like you tried your hardest and THAT is what daughters pick up on (trust me). \n\nTBH if you came home with the prettiest pinkest cake you can find at the grocery store and ask for a redo just the two of you, that will likely become what she remembers.

All other things being equal, I don't think that this memory will scar your daughter for life - when she is older she will probably be grateful for how hard you tried, and hopefully you will be able to laugh together at the culinary mishaps that ensued - but you should be able to take at least some of the sting out of the situation by following the excellent advice you have been given elsewhere in this thread.

Next time just buy a cake from a bakery.", "ESH except for your daughter of course.\n\nYou should not promise things that you will not be able to do and you should have though of a plan b if you messed up. \n\nBut life and mistakes happen and, while your child reaction is normal, your family should be kind to you and your sister reaction was uncalled for. \n\nNow is the time to go apologize to your daughter and propose to do the cake together. It would be a fun activity to find the decoration and things that she like to put on it and do it together. Buy premixed cake if you mess that one too so that you have a cake to eat at the end. \nMy best memories are failed attempt to do beautiful decoration for cake with families and friends and it\u2019s also a great thing for her to learn.", "YTA\n\nThere are cooks/bakers/chefs that make millions a year who share that even they use a pre-made cake mix from the baking aisle. They may doctor it up a bit, but the basics necessary are super simple and listed on the box. \n\nAbsolutely, your kid will remember this. However, I think this is something that you can turn around so it turns into a sweet memory for your daughter instead of an awful one. If you want to try to amend this:\n\nGo to the local store, buy the flavor of cake mix she likes best (I think Duncan Hines is the best) and a jar of frosting. Check the box for instructions, make sure you have the ingredients (usually just egg, water, vegetable oil) and the proper sized pan. Grab a box or jar of pink gel food coloring (you might need to check the party/cake decorating section usually near the craft stuff). Go home, make the cake, **wait for it to cool completely,** then smooth the frosting over top. \n\nTell her how sorry you are that you didn't get the cake made in time for her party, that you tried really hard but kept making mistakes.\n\nFor next year, start watching and reading some well reviewed bakers recipes and repeatedly try them so that you can make her an amazing cake from scratch.", "YTA. \n\nI have made 16 cakes between my three kids so far, one just turned 12. Not once have I made a cake from scratch, and I don't know if I ever will. Maybe this year but we'll see. \n\nI have used boxed cake mix every time. They tell me the flavor color or they pick it out themselves along with the icing. \n\nCosts me like what? $20 for pre-made cake mix and icing, maybe eggs and oil. \n\nPoint is, that you didn't need to make one from scratch. My daughter has loved every single themed cake I have done for her to match her party decor, and it's made using a box cake. \n\nYou could have bought a box of link cake mix, or gone with white/yellow/funfettie, and added in pink food coloring to the cake and frosting. \n\nYOU chose to waste the ingredients instead of just using box mix. After five cakes, instead of justing using the close enough 5th one. You could and should have gone to the store for cake mix, food coloring, and frosting. \n\nYou ruined your kids party, and this is a really big deal for her. She will never let this go and you'll be lucky if she asks you to make it instead of just buying one. \n\nShe will remember this every birthday from here on out and weigh whether or not she wants to take the risk of you making her cake and halassing it, just to end up making cookies instead of calling someone for help or just using a pre-made cake mix, or even buying a pink cake. \n\nNext time call your sister, buy a cake or use a cake mix. \n\nYou half asked this, don't be surprised that she's hurt, crying and a little resentful now.", "She won\u2019t remember the cake as much as she\u2019ll remember a broken promise.\n\nYTA.

Explain to your daughter what happened and let her know you put in the effort, it just didn't work, and you had to improvise. If you play it right, she'll remember it as that time Dad couldn't figure out how to bake a cake and not a horrible disaster. Next time, either buy a cake or put in some time prior to the party to learn how to bake a cake. As someone who has baked every cake for his two kids (40 cakes total), that effort means something (my soon to be 24yo still wants me to do it). I'd recommend a book called \"Baking Illustrated\" that has a lot of good material on how to bake everything from bread to cakes. If you pay attention to the instructions and get the measurements right, you'll do fine. It might not even be a bad idea to do it with your daughter and make some fun memories.", "YTA.

I\u2019ve had a few pretty bad birthdays when I was a kid, one where my parents forgot my birthday and one where I was beat by a parent. It can be tough because the expectation is that the day will be special and perfect. If I expected a cake and didn\u2019t get one, I would have been bummed out too, and your daughter is probably processing a lot of complex emotions at this time with her grief and was expecting this to be a good day.\n\nWhat people couldn\u2019t see was the effort that you made in baking those cakes. I think it is sweet that you tried to make her a cake. If there wasn\u2019t a financial barrier to it, I do think you should have tried to buy a cake when you couldn\u2019t figure out how to bake one. I also agree with others that a cake mix would have been a good idea. The thing is, you can still make it up to her. You can still bring her a pretty pink cake or do something special for her. She may remember that you didn\u2019t get her a cake that day, but she\u2019ll also remember that you made it up to her by doing xyz, and that can make it a more positive memory.\n\nAlso, your sister was way out of line for shaming you for it.

And what on EARTH made you think that because she asked for a specific cake, YOU NEEDED TO CHANGE UP YOUR NORM AND TRY TO BAKE IT INSTEAD OF BUY IT?!?! Seriously? Did you HONESTLY think your cake was going to be a pretty pink cake? Prettier than one you clearly could\u2019ve bought? And by the way, what\u2019s even worse than that is that you didn\u2019t even attempt this before hand, you just thought, meh, whatever. If it looks good it looks good, if it doesn\u2019t, I tried, screw her birthday. Oh and by the way, YES. YOUR CHILD WILL 100% REMEMBER THIS FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. You should be ashamed.", "YTA. You know you\u2019re a bad baker, you had to try five times and throughout the entire process\u2026 you didn\u2019t think of buying one? Or using cake mix?", "I think this is a bit harsh to go with YTA. Yea OP should have just bought one and been honest with his daughter but it sounds like he legit tried and failed. Baking isn\u2019t for everyone.", "Gently YTA, your heart was in the right place but after the first failing you should have rushed to the store and buy something premade. And even when it was too late to do that you should not have let your daughter find out in front of everybody. But it'll pass, it's not like it's gonna scar her forever, just plan better next time.", "YTA--and frankly, not as gentle a one as the other commenters are giving you.\n\nLet's break this down. Your daughter asked for a pretty pink cake. You promised her a pretty pink cake. Nowhere in your post do you suggest that your daughter insisted that YOU make her a pretty pink cake--she just wanted an actual birthday cake on her birthday. This is, to be clear, not an unreasonable request.\n\nFor some reason, despite not having any experience in baking *and not even having measuring cups*, you decided you had to make this cake. You made five attempts, failed each one, got frustrated, and ended up making sugar cookies--which are, to state the obvious, not cake. At no point did it occur to you to: (1) ask for help from someone, *anyone*, who is a competent baker; (2) use a box mix; (3) buy freaking measuring cups; or (4) order a cake from a grocery store bakery (depending on the store, they can be almost as good as a fancy bakery cake at a fraction of the cost). Rather than make *any reasonable attempt* to fulfill your daughter's very reasonable request, you let your frustration with the cake-baking process get the best of you and blindsided her at her birthday party by showing up with cookies instead of cake.\n\nAnd now you're claiming to be \"confused\" by the fact that she is upset and your sister is--rightfully--critical of how you handled this. Seriously?\n\nI am deeply, deeply sorry about the loss of your wife. That is such an awful and traumatic thing to have to go through. (Obligatory f\\*\\*\\* cancer.) But your daughter lost her mother. That means you are the only parent she has left, and you failed to fulfill a simple promise on her birthday. She has every right to be upset, and you need to figure out a way to make this up to her.", "YTA. Oh my god, after the first couple of failures, just buy the kid a cake. You can definitely buy a pretty pink cake. She doesn't give a shit if you're doing your best or you're a good baker or not, she wants a pretty pink cake for her birthday and it was fully within your power to make that happen\u2014but instead you made it all about you.", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/easy\\_vanilla\\_cupcakes\\_78448", "Yta. \nI understand that you wanted to make the cake yourself because she requested it, but when she is requesting a very specific cake do you really think that that is the time to start trying to work on your baking skills? Did you not think that after maybe the first or second time you failed, that you should go out and buy a cake? Did you not think to tell her that you tried before the party happened, and that she would be getting cookies instead of a cake so that she had time to process that information instead of surprising her with it in front of everybody, after she's already hyped up the pretty pink cake that you promised her?\nI understand you wanted to do something nice for your daughter. But there were about eight other ways you could have gone about this, that wouldn't have resulted in this heartbreaking experience in front of everybody, not only for her, but for you and probably everyone else involved. Watching a kid cry is not easy for anyone.", "Look, I\u2019m not willing to go so far as to say YTA, but you did mess up pretty badly by not explaining it to her before she was in front of the whole family. And you could have just asked for help or bought a cake. Now, the kid isn\u2019t going to be scarred for life by this. She probably won\u2019t remember it next year, but you need to take steps TODAY to make it up to her. GO BUY A DAMN CAKE RIGHT NOW, and you two share it tonight while you explain why you tried and failed: because you really wanted to make something special for her but you just weren\u2019t good at it. Better yet, you two try baking a cake together.", "Looks like this might be an unpopular opinion but I'm going with a (somewhat borderline) NAH. You obviously did try really hard, and if you don't have experience baking it's easy to underestimate how finnicky baking is. Even if it didn't end up being the right move I think it's admirable that you tried to do it yourself! The only place you lean towards being TA (imo) is that you absolutely needed to pull her aside and explain the situation privately rather than disappointing her in front of everyone. \nThis is probably something that'll stick with her, but it's not unfixable - maybe try again and include her in the process, do something simpler like using a cake mix (I see someone already mentioned the using a pink soda and white cake mix trick), make a bonding experience out of it, let her have some friends over to show off the pretty pink cake she helped make. If you make a point to make it up to her that'll go a lot further in her memory than the initial disappointment.", "I'm gonna break with others here and go with a NTA\n\nI can't imagine the emotions you must go through raising your daughter alone after your wife died and you tried your best. You should have explained to her what happened before the moment, true, but I don't think your lack of thought here makes you an asshole. \n\nIt's clear you love your daughter and you tried really hard. \n\nWhy not buy her a pink cake and surprise her with it now?

If I was to vote it be Soft YTA just for not letting her know. Being a single parent is hard no matter if it is a man or woman. Just take a deep breath talk with your daughter and make it up to her. Let her know how sorry you are. Parents make mistakes we are human too. Everyone on here needs to stop being some harsh with him. He just made a parenting mistake and there is no one on here that can not say they never made a mistake. The key is to learn from it so he doesn\u2019t make it again.", "You people are heartless!

He clearly is struggling and worried he\u2019s messed his daughter up for life over a birthday cake.  And this is just not the case.

Could he have given up earlier, should he have pulled daughter aside and let her know, probably.  But there\u2019s always nuance in every situation that we don\u2019t know/aren\u2019t thinking about.  And this is clear that it was a loving father trying really hard.

Your daughter will not remember this forever as the moment all of her childhood fell apart. It\u2019s just cake. However, I recommend that you use this as an opportunity to create some new memories with your daughter. Tell her you know she wanted a pink cake and you feel terrible that it didn\u2019t work out (all true). Then let her know that you want to make sure you can get it right for her next birthday so would she be willing to help you perfect the recipe? Then over the next few months, every couple weeks, bake a cake together. Try new flavors and colors, laugh at your epic failures and enjoy your successes together. It will make for great stories and next year you won\u2019t feel so overwhelmed at the prospect of baking a cake!", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA.  You tried, multiple times at that.  You genuinely cared.  So many people on here are like, duh, why not just buy a cake and call it good?  Because you're a loving father who wanted to go above and beyond.  Or why did you bother waiting until the day of to start baking?  Because if you've never baked before, then it's difficult to know how long it might take or that it needs to be fully cooled before icing, etc.\n\nI think your sister is majorly overreacting.  Crushed your daughter's dreams?  She'll remember this forever?  Give me a break.  She's acting like you gleefully announced that you couldn't be bothered to make anything for your daughter's birthday.  Now THAT would be upsetting.  Kids are resilient.  I doubt your daughter will remember this a month from now.  Even if she does, she'll know you still made her pink cookies.  Maybe before her next birthday, take some baking classes so you'll be fully prepared to make her next cake.", "Apparently, 46% men are confident they could safely land a passenger airplane in an emergency situation, so I\u2019m not surprised you thought you could make a pretty pink cake for the first time on the day of a birthday party.

You can increase the ingredients in that 1 egg, 100g of everything quantity.\nYou grease the tin with butter, roll some flour around to coat it so the cake doesn't stick, then bake it at 180C for like 20 minutes or until the top feels firm and a sharp knife inserted into the middle comes out clean. \n\nIt's not fancy, but it's cake.

You can\u2019t ice a hot or warm cake. \n\nI think you can still save this though. See if you can schedule a time (soon!) to get together with a trusted family member AND your daughter to make a nice maraschino cherry cake with pink frosting TOGETHER. Make a day of it. Have something scheduled (like a movie) for after the cake comes out of the oven while it\u2019s cooling before you ice it. Apologize sincerely to your daughter. It\u2019s awful when a parent breaks their promise. But she would probably rather have time with you rather than just throwing a pink cake at her, you know? Spend the time together. Learn together. Give her another memory to cling to. And show her than even when you fail, you dust yourself off, and just keep trying. Teach her resilience. \n\nBaking can be difficult. It is more of an exact science at the beginning. Having a set time it needed to be finished while also dealing with the extra grief of thinking about your wife more because it\u2019s a birthday is going to put your mindset in a place where everything is more difficult. It is not surprising one bit that you had issues. Give yourself some grace in the future. Don\u2019t schedule as much for yourself on days where the grief is going to hit extra hard. \n\nTwo years is not very long at all to grieve a spouse. It\u2019s absolutely normal to have an extra sharp wave of grief hit you around birthdays and celebrations. Don\u2019t give up on yourself. You are trying. Keep trying. You can do this.", "Yta but I think you know that. stop using things to get sympathy, accept it and sort it out.", "Very gentle YTA.\n\nYou tried your best, and that\u2019s great. But this was a product of poor planning and lack of forethought.\n\n1) always make the cake the day before. Baking is actually a lot easier than cooking imo, because you just need to measure the ingredients. Making it pretty is another story, but I don\u2019t understand how you threw out five cakes. I always do this the day before an event, and if you really couldn\u2019t do it you could have time to buy a store bought cake.\n\n2) why on earth didn\u2019t you pull your daughter aside before cake and let her know what happened? At 9 she would be old enough to process her disappointment a little, but young enough that being caught off guard with disappointment is deeply upsetting", "The only assholes are in the replies lmfao.

You were in the wrong to promise to \u201cmake\u201d your daughter a pink cake when you didn\u2019t know what the heck you were promising or doing.

Buy one, throw some pink food coloring in there and decorate with a can of frosting. Doesn't get much easier. You could also have made the cake ahead of time and frozen it. There was no reason for you to be baking five cakes the day of the party in a panic. \n\nSetting all of that you could have at least explained to your daughter what happened so she knew what to expect in front of the guests instead of just surprising her with the cookies.\n\nAt this point it would be nice of you to get her a pink cake and do a little redo between the two of you.", "Pillsbury has a pink box cake mix that strawberry flavored and I love it.", "Why didn't he buy a box cake mix? Just add eggs and oil and it's done.", "Even if he had managed to get the cake to bake well he never would have presented a pretty pink cake  - for one a cake needs to cool completely before you frost it.

It is not like frosting a cookie at all.  \n\nThe problem is he waited for the last minute to fulfill his daughter's request.  If he really wanted to make her a cake he could have at the very least done it the night before.  Baking a cake the day you are hosting a party is insanity.  Also it takes about an hour to make a batch of cookies and frost them, unless they are in the middle of nowhere that is enough time to get to a grocery store and grab a small cake.  Maybe it wouldn't be pink, maybe you could bribe someone who works there into putting some pink details on it.  But still a step up from cookies.

Wallowing in it instead of making a plan is, and we haven't seen any plans from OP about fixing it or even any remorse about his kid's feelings, only that he's sad and wishes his wife would come sort it out.

It is either weighing stuff if you are European or ratio (capacity/cups) if you are American. Most people who I've talked to who are bad at baking don't follow a recipe properly (you have to be exact) or don't set timers. It is just basic science and maths. \n\nThat aside, where I think the OP is TA is because they must have known how bad they are at baking, so they should have had a fallback option and tried in advance.

Good grief...\n\nI've been there, just after I got divorced, my ex husband kept everything and I had to live off tea eggs and a packet of cheap Malaysian instant noodles every day, but on the weekends, when my son would stay with me, I used all my money to buy some ingredients to make sure he had normal home cooked meals. I spoke openly with him, 4 at the time, about how I didn't have the money to buy the fast food he wanted, but we could cook something similar or better at home. \n\nLuckily for me, I grew up baking birthday cakes with my grandma for every cousin's birthday every single year for 20 years. I also used to work in a bakery. As a result, even though I couldn't buy a custom cake for my son, I was able to make a rainbow layer cake with cookie and cream frosting. Rainbow layer cake aren't really a thing in Taiwan, so it was a huge hit at his preschool.\n\nFor someone who may not have grown up with a parent who baked, you probably wouldn't think to grab a box mix, so I don't blame you. Baking a cake at home can be easy, but it takes time. It needs to cool before frosting, otherwise your frosting will all melt off and it'll look horrid (I have repeated this mistake many times, because I'm very impatient). \n\nIf you can make pancakes, you can make a thousand layer cake. Cook up as many crepes as you can, about the size of a decent frying pan. Let them cool, and remember to keep wax paper or powdered sugar between them or they'll stick together. Alternatively, after each crepe is cooked, just immediately add your filling on top and place in the freezer while you cook the next crepe. I made chocolate crepes with coconut pecan frosting to make a German chocolate flavoured thousand layer cake. For pink, maybe you could add strawberry powder (for baking, not for drink mixes) to the batter and use buttercream and chopped strawberries as the filling between each layer. It's much more time consuming as you have to actively cook each crepe as opposed to just sticking it in the oven and forgetting about it like a cake, but it's also much easier and you can see it coming along as you go, so there's more of an instant feeling of success. \n\nBeing a single parent is rough, especially if you weren't equipped with basic cooking, baking, and handiwork skills while you were growing up. YouTube is a great school, just search on YouTube for anything you want to learn. Good luck! Don't give up, and don't be too hard on yourself!!! In Taiwan, we didn't even have box cake mixes until maybe a year or two ago, and even now there's usually only 1 or 2 flavours to choose from.

It isn't inherently obvious that baking is significantly more likely to go wrong than cooking is if you're not someone who's had much exposure to it. So he could have done better for sure, but I can empathize with how someone who 100% meant well and was trying might manage to get themselves into this situation anyway.", "Especially when he's listening to her talk about the cake all day. \n\nFFS a pink cake is not that big an ask.", "I don't really understand.

This is a foundational moment for her in how she should expect future partners to behave, in what she believes she deserves.\n\nYou humiliated her in front of her family with zero preparation. You need to show her that you will do better moving forward.\n\nGood luck. It is very heavy to be responsible for the development of children, everyone makes mistakes. Learn from it, help her learn from it, and realize this is your responsibility to apologize, fix, and move forward with more caution around timelines.", "Because being a single, widowed dad is tough but being a kid who just lost their mom, coping with their birthday is also tough. And now she knows that when dad asks her what would make these hard days special, he can\u2019t even plan ahead enough to come through for her. I actually felt heartbroken for her reading this.", ">Even Cake Mixes, for some, can be more difficult than they should be.\n\n>If you like adding a dash of this and a sprinkle of that (creative types) - you may struggle to bake, even with a pre-made mix.\n\nI can only speak for myself, but I barely even measure when I use a cake mix. I\u2019ll use a random cup as a \u201ccup\u201c even though it may not be 8 ounces and I sometimes throw in random stuff (like cinnamon or nutmeg). I have never had a cake mix turn out anything other than delicious.  Cake mixes are as close to idiot proof as something can be.", "Yup. I don\u2019t buy that he messed up 5 cakes. And if he did, after the second one, he should have got some box mix or accepted that he had to go out and buy one. \n\nHe insisted on making the cake to make it more special but instead, she ended up missing out on cake altogether.", "I get curious what they do for a job....box cake or store cake and miss crocker was the easy way. Actually my cookie recipe has more ingredients then my cake recipe", "If he was able to get cookies right on the first try, he could have gotten a cake right in one of the five tries.", "Yeah this is pretty baffling to me in general tbh. So many people talk about the difficulty of cooking/baking in a way that often makes it sound like they just\u2026 didn\u2019t use a recipe? Like I managed to make a passable chocolate cream pie with homemade crust at 10ish years old just by getting into one of my mom\u2019s recipe books and following the directions\u2014 baking is a science, and when it comes to a basic cake, the directions really aren\u2019t very difficult to follow.", "But he managed to bake cookies. Read the instructions and follow through. The steps are broken down. I think sometimes, if you are frustrated or not committed to it, you can eff that up. But you are right. There were other avenues open to him, boxed mix, professional, or a friend.\n\nBoxed is a very good start if you don't know how to bake. Just add extra egg to make it rich, use zest,  sprinkles, etc, to elevate the mix. I found the suggestions from others who tried the recipe on an online recipe super useful.", "A sheet cake at most supermarkets around here (nyc) would be that price", "A Costco half sheet cake is $20 feeds about 48 people. \n\nAt our local grocery store a round cake is about 19 and a quarter sheet cake is 27.\n\nWhere do you live? That cakes are priced so outrageously?", "Think grocery store not bakery", "Sheet cakes or standard ones at big box stores around me (Midwest) or 2 tier round cakes are around $15-30 depending on size.  A regular 9x13 with just icing and like a happy birthday is about $20.", "In Vegas that's the price range at your local grocery store.  Sure, private bakeries are more expensive, but for under $20 he could have gotten a big sheet cake from Sam's club.", "When you have to try five times to get something right and you're on a time crunch, you are in fact the a******. After you fail once or twice, acknowledge that you're not a good baker, realize that you're not going to get it, then you should be willing to except failure at that point and try a different avenue. 5 times was too many. After time too, he should have realized he wasn't going to get it. Time three was beginning to be wishful thinking on his part. Time four was overkill, time number five was finally the actual breaking point, but it was ridiculous.", "You can have good intentions and still be the AH. He said he tried FIVE times to bake the cake. For a start, how a grown adult can get the measurements wrong that many times in a row (as he said he did) is beyond me, but why did he not stop sooner (or practice before the actual birthday?!) and buy one. And even then, with the cookies, the time his daughter found out about the broken promise should not have been as they were brought out while folk were singing happy birthday. \n\nOf course she\u2019ll remember this forever. He father made her a promise, broke it and there was an audience for the moment she found out.", "You couldn\u2019t afford to buy a cake ($20-30 at a grocery store) but could afford to waste ingredients for 5 cakes and a batch of cookies (at least a dozen eggs (2/cake and 2 for the cookies) = $7ish currently, each cake was probably ~2 cups of flour and the cookies were probably about the same so you needed 3 pounds of flours for that = $10ish, probably 1.5 cups of sugar/cake and similar for the cookies so you needed 3 pounds of sugar = $10ish, plus the oil around 1/3 cup/ cake, vanilla around 1.5tsp per cake, etc that you need you probably spent about $40-50 on cake ingredients). \n\nAlso you didn\u2019t have a car to go get a cake but somehow had at least a dozen eggs, 3 pounds of flour, 3 pounds of sugar, 2 cups of oil, 9 tsps of vanilla, pink food coloring, and sprinkles laying around your house? The eggs, oil, and vanilla and maybe believable if you don\u2019t usual bake and don\u2019t eat eggs for breakfast ever but there\u2019s no way you had enough flour and sugar laying around your house to make 5 cakes and a batch of cookies from scratch if you weren\u2019t planning on making the cake in the first place so you definitely had to go to the store (or send someone to the store) for ingredients\u2026", "How did you happen to have all the supplies to make 5 cakes last minute without going to the store?\n\nAll your comments make it seem less about the mistake and more about your poor planning", "Why didn\u2019t you ask your sister for help?", "All the wet ingredients. Usually you just need a can of pop (355 mL) to replace them all. \n\nSo it's a quick way to veganize a cake too.", "Someone in another comment suggested that he may have been attempting to cut 2 circular cake layers out of 2 rectangular sheet cake, and that\u2019s potentially even dumber than what I was imagining, which is being unable to use a set of measuring cups properly", "Genuine question, feeding how many people? Cuz even a half sheet at Costco is 25$", "My guess when he says he couldn't get the measurements right..he was using a 9x13 cake pan and cutting circles for a layered cake. \nA soft AH. He is navigating a world without his wife who I would guess took care of birthday cakes. You don't wait til day of to make a cake.", "INFO: Was there any particular reason you didn't look it up? A Google search will tell you that 1 cup = 16 tbsp. If all you had were measuring spoons you could just look up how many go into a cup...", "YTA\n\nDude. Talk to a therapist about your executive function disorder or whatever the hell this is. I don't know. But this is not normal adult behavior. \n\nBuy the cake. Color it pink. \n\nBuy a box mix. \n\nPay someone to make the cake. \n\nWhatever. \n\nBut clearly you were unable to use any of a number of options to solve this issue because you have no problem solving skills and no ability to think ahead. \n\nBuy measuring cups. \n\nCall a friend for a ride. Yeah that might be embarrassing but you as the parent who had screwed up should have been willing. \n\nYou were not willing to solve this problem. YTA", "Is this a poverty thing? Because otherwise, this is poor planning and incompetence. Maybe that whole bumbling fool routine worked when you had a wife to manage your life, but it's time to step up. I'm sure this is not the only mess in your life.", "Dude, measuring cups are dirt cheap compared to messing up that badly.", "16 tablespoons per cup. You could\u2019ve googled.", "Do you not have google? Like around cake number 3, would you not google the conversion? Or a new recipe? I\u2019m not trying to be sarcastic, I\u2019m genuinely baffled.", "Ok. YTA, but this is a gentle one. You tried, your heart was absolutely in the right place. But you could have: 1) Bought a cake and explained the situation to your daughter. 2) Bought an undecorated sponge cake and decorated it. 3) Ask a family member or friend to help bake a cake. 4) Bought a box cake mix and make it. The directions are simple and the additions are minimal. 5) Stopped at a bakery and ask them for an undecorated cake. 6) Bought a grocery store cake, wiped the icing off and re-decorated it. 7) Made cookies and explained to your daughter ahead of time. \n\nI appreciate your attempts so much, but there were at least a half dozen other options before surprising your daughter with something she didn\u2019t request. Saying that, if you haven\u2019t told her about all your failed attempts already, please do so. It will highlight for her how much you love her and were willing to torture yourself to attempt to make her happy. And apologize to yourself for being so stubborn that you would attempt to make 5 cakes and drive yourself crazy.", "Well, OP did say he got the measurements wrong. With some luck, maybe that means he barely wasted anything at all!", "Wouldn\u2019t this sweeten it too much? Just thinking of how sweet something pink like cream soda is. Still heavily considering trying this out lol!", "And even if he is that\u2026 clueless\u2026 lol, after the second fail, he should have resorted to a different cake plan!", "He actually replied that he only had measuring spoons but the recipe had cups", "Someone who doesnt bake probably doesnt have round cake pans.\n\nHe should have just made a sheet cake if he doesnt have the money to buy cake pans.  Or just run to costco and get a 15 dollar cake.", "I would assume at least 18, Im not a sheet cake expert. A costco half sheet is like 25ish people though", "Okay but you know what I\u2019d do in that scenario, if that\u2019s what actually happened? Give her a fucking rectangular cake. If he wants it to have layers, cut it in half. But if he genuinely was successfully making cakes and then cutting them to pieces trying to get circles, I honestly think that may be even dumber than being unable to use a set of measuring cups\n\nI\u2019m sorry that he lost his wife but his daughter lost her mother, and unfortunately the role of the adult in situations like this is to have their fucking shit together. He decided to do this. He decided to not ask for help. He decided to not buy one.", "A full set of measuring cups and spoons costs $1.25 at the Dollar Tree.\n\nGoogling is free.", "And measuring cups can be bought at drugstores, grocery stores, etc. It's not like they had to be special ordered or something.", "You decided to bake a cake from scratch even though you\u2019ve never baked anything before. I just\u2026.don\u2019t get it.", "So I mean, your battery died...you literally just needed a jump. I guess it's possible something more serious was wrong, but a jump would have taken like <5 minutes. \n\nI feel like you aren't making sense. You say you couldn't afford a cake and can't afford to fix your car...but then say you planned to buy a cake?", "It's a case of poor planning and a lot of winging it. Unfortunately that still makes you a jerk (ah might be too strong a word) because it is your fault, even if unintentional.\n\nCommunication is always the key to a good relationship.

When exactly did she request her special dream pink cake? The day of? A week before? I commend you for wanting to bake her dream cake yourself, but I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t have a backup plan. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you immediately put in an order somewhere for her cake and then ask someone else to pick it up since your car wasn\u2019t working? Were you baking her cake the literal day of her party? Yeah, that\u2019s never going to go well if you\u2019re not good at baking. \n\nVery soft YTA. You should\u2019ve asked someone to get a pink cake. Put multiple people on the task and ask them to go to different places. Whomever buys the cake first lets everyone else know. I\u2019m sure others would\u2019ve been happy to do this for you and your daughter.", "you had the ingredients for 5 cakes just lying around when you don't cook?", "No neighbors to give your car a jump?", "I mean, it would sweeten it a bit, but I don't think it does more than icing in that department. So if you did find it too sweet, you could probably try with whipped cream for icing instead of a buttercream if you don't need the structure since I think it's easier to make that less sweet if you're making your own whipped cream. \n\ntbh, I don't know if it's possible for a cake to be too sweet though.", "And he lives in the 90s before you could easily google shit I guess.", "If only you could buy measuring cups at the grocery store\u2026", "I mean, that's annoying but not a showstopping issue as long as you can count... \n\nA 5 second Google search will do the conversions for you.", "Definitely errors on his end that made stuff a lot worse. Should of asked for help..yup sure had. Have you lost a spouse with young children?\nIt is the hardest to keep anything straight.

Hell, if none of your family will help, find a cake online and I'll pay for it. \n\n\nYou tried, you really did. It was maybe misguided, but the effort was there. When your daughter is older she'll appreciate it, but she's a bit young to fully grasp now. \n\nBut if you get her a cake now instead of waiting for 'next time', she won't take away the disappointment until she understands, she'll take away that because things don't go right at first, you don't give up. \n\n\nAnd I'm so sorry for for your loss. I can't imagine how hard things have been.", "ETA\u2014Just read your comment that your daughter told you about this the day of her birthday. I can\u2019t understand your thought process on this.
