I\u2019m a single dad. My wife sadly died of breast cancer around 2 years ago. My daughter was only 6 when this happened, and the grief process is tough. But, I guess I can say after 2 years I\u2019m finally coming to terms with her death.\n\nAnyways, my daughters birthday was yesterday. She\u2019s now a 9 year old. \n\nMy daughter told me that she wanted a very pretty pink cake. I told her that I would definitely be making her one.\n\nI have never baked in my life before. I usually buy store bought cakes for birthdays but I wanted this one to be special since she requested it. I should also mention that friends and family were coming over for her birthday.\n\nIt was hell trying to bake that cake. I know I\u2019m not that great of a cook but Jesus Christ I\u2019m a bad baker. I ended up throwing out about 5 cakes because I couldn\u2019t get the measurements right. At this point, I was wasting ingredients and it was getting pretty late and I knew guests would be arriving soon. I didn\u2019t know what to do at that point so I searched up a quick cookie recipe because I figured that would be easier than cakes. I found a simple sugar cookie recipe and managed to make it without messing it up too bad. I made sure to add in pink food coloring and added sprinkles on top though, just to fulfill her requests at least a little bit.\n\nSo, cookies are done. Guests are here. Party\u2019s thriving. The time finally comes to sing happy birthday. My daughter is sitting expectantly at the end of the table and is telling everyone she\u2019s so excited for her pretty pink cake. Imagine her disappointment when I walk out with a tray full of cookies. I lit some candles though so she could still have the experience.\n\nI set the cookies down in front of her and when she looked up at me her sad expression broke me. She asked me where was the pretty pink cake and I told her that I tried my best to make it but this was the only thing I made without messing up. She burst into tears and everybody was staring at me like I had two heads. \n\nShe calmed down and ended up eating the cookies and blowing out the candles though. I thought everything was fine but when she was going to bed she told me she really wanted a pretty pink cake. I told her I was sorry and that I would try my hardest to make her one next time. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning. My sister who was at the party texted me and said that it was selfish of me to not keep trying to make the cake and that I crushed my daughters dreams and she\u2019ll remember this forever. I still haven\u2019t responded to this message because I don\u2019t know how to react to this. I\u2019m feeling pretty heartbroken right now. Is it true that she\u2019ll remember this forever? I\u2019m scared that my daughter will resent me for not making her the cake. She did get very upset about it. It\u2019s starting to really make me wish my wife was still here. Because I know she would reassure me, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve done something wrong.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling confused right now.

I get trying from scratch, but after the second fail, why not just go the east route?", "Couldn't you have gotten a store bought cake, atleast after 3 failed tries, as a safety option or ordered a cake, and made cookies if you personally wanted to make something so there were options and she wouldn't get upset?", "Kind of YTA. You sort of promised her that she would have a cake. Take it as a lesson learnt. Don\u2019t wait until the day of to try and bake a cake! Next time, try a few weeks before, get her to help you, kids her age tend to enjoy helping to bake.

Like a dyed sponge cake with red fruits on top or something similarly simple?\n\nHindsight is 20/20 and I don't think you're selfish for trying but damn you sure were unorganised.\n\nThat being said, I'm sure your daughter is alright. You apologised, shit happens.", "Soft AH, OP. \n\nYou were needlessly stubborn, OP. She might have been *a little bit* disappointed that you didn't make it, versus *massively* disappointed not to have the cake she dreamed of. \n\nIn fact, you could have nailed a home-run with this: bought her one she wanted, explained why you did (teaching her an important lesson about setbacks and finding alternatives, and you could have offered that the two of you could practice cake baking together.\n\nYou can still win by doing exactly this: buy her the cake she wants (Easter is a good excuse or find another), talk to her about it so she knows it wasn't a snub, and then suggest you two practice baking cakes together (starting with simple cakes and building from there). That would be a win for you both.", "A gentle YTA...if you know you arent a baker you shouldve got one made...even a relatively cheapie  shop bought one you couldve \"pinked up\" and made pretty, if a specially made one was too expensive for you.  You went out of your way to ask your daughter what she wanted, promised it to her, then let her down in front of  everyone.  Yu get marks for trying, but common sense should have told you to try your hand at baking sooner than the night before the birthday, if it was something you hadnt attempted before.\n\nI have to add, I find your comment of \"I wish my wife was still here to reassure me\" a bit odd.  It sounds as if you are keen to receive sympathy rather than really wondering  AITA", "YTA soft - don\u2019t promise to kids if you can\u2019t keep them. There was no need to wait until the last minute to find out you can\u2019t bake a cake. I bet she wouldn\u2019t have cared it was bad anyway so long as it was pink.

You should have bought the cake after the first failure.  Five cakes?  What in Gordon Ramsey's name were you thinking?\n\nWill your daughter be traumatized by this?  No, probably not.

Take it as a lesson learnt.  Next time, order a damn cake.  You are NTA cause you genuinely tried.   Next time you promise your daughter something, don't assume you can do it if you never have before when a time line is involved.", "Mild YTA.

This sounds like a very normal parenting mistake and you clearly were trying to do the right thing here. Maybe as a thought for next year, you can try *buying* her the cake, but *making* her something, as well. It's not like she and her party guests wouldn't enjoy both. For now, you can still buy her a birthday cake and let her have a few friends over without having another party. No, it won't be the same, but I think at her age, she'll appreciate it and it'll turn this into a funny story for her when she's older.\n\nThat stated, I also think your sister *way* overreacted. Giving her cookies instead of a cake may have bummed your daughter out, but you didn't ruin the kid's life.", "YTA", "Lesson learned\u2026soft YTA. Should\u2019ve just went a got a cake.

Why did it have to be made from scratch when easier options exist???", "Why couldn\u2019t you just bite the bullet and buy her one pink cake with sprinkles on it? Just one, for this one special day?\n\nAlso I fail to see how you could fail at measurement\u2019s for making a cake - but successfully complete a plate of cookies. Baking is still baking. \n\nYTA", "YTA- but you can make it up to her. Bring her to pick a cake mix, and icing and all the fixings.

I usually buy store bought cakes for birthdays but I wanted this one to be special since she requested it.\n\nI do not understand. She requested a pretty pink cake, not the homemade. Why did you decided to make it yourself? Or did you hope to outperform professional bakers (or anyone who had already baked some cakes)? \n\nYou could have ordered custom cake from the bakery, asked you family to help. Even if you was 100% sure you had to bake the cake yourself,  you should have checked if you could actually bake it before the birthday (and understood that you can not and chose one of the other options).  \n\nYTA", "YTA why didn\u2019t you just buy one this is ridiculous", "Info: I think that\u2019s sweet you have her cookies but why didn\u2019t you go to a bakery or a grocery store they\u2019re good and cheap?

I\u2019m sure some of your guests would\u2019ve done that for you too. There\u2019s a reason the saying goes \u201cIt takes a village\u201d.

I say that gently because it sounds like you made a genuine effort to make your daughter the cake she wanted. However there were other ways you could have handled this; you said you\u2019ve never baked. Is there a friend or family member who bakes that could have helped you make it? If so you should have asked them for help. Otherwise you should have just bought the cake. At the very least you should have spoken with your daughter privately, explained your struggles with the cake, and that you made cookies instead.

Buy cake mix, they're available in pink and only require measuring out two things\n2. Buy a cake from a bakery, her only request was that the cake be pink, she didn't say you had to make it\n3.

Emergency plan B, call a responsible adult coming to the party and ask them to stop by any grocery story with a bakery or stand alone bakery and see what they have available for that day. You may have gotten lucky with a strawberry cake or maybe a red velvet and had some explaining to do but at least it would have been MUCH closer to what she asked for\n\nYou do none of these and then take the cowards way out by not even explaining to your daughter what happened so she could at least not be blindsided by disappointment. YTA!", "YTA after reading your responses. You half assed this whole attempt and you know it. You didn\u2019t replace the missing measuring cups, you just decided to wing it with spoons instead.

At that point, you should of called the local bakery and order a pink rosette birthday cake to save the day. \nNext time, do that!", "YTA - You made the whole thing about yourself. Your daughter just wanted a pink cake. There are so many alternative ways for you to have obtained a pink cake, and you failed to do the ONE THING she wanted because you had it in your head that making it from scratch mattered to her.\n\nYou need to learn that OUTCOMES matter.

You had the whole party and before it to tell her. She\u2019s 9, she understands. Instead you let her think it was coming, and disappointed her in front of all her friends.

Right up to that moment where she was going to blow out the candles, you let her believe she was going to get her pretty pink cake. I have to say, in all honesty I wouldnt have gotten to the stage where I made 5 cakes before giving up. Id have probably tried twice and then popped out to buy something, even a pink cup cake. You could have made a joke out of that in a look sweetie I tried and this was all I could manage, whilst giving everyone else your home made cookies. You shouldnt have left her thinking she had her cake though", "Soft YTA.\n\nDon't make promises you know you can't keep.  I know you tried, but obviously the effort didn't end up with the result you wanted.  Next time, just do boxed cake mix or have some sort of backup (after all, you did promise it).  Those are super easy and no one is gonna know you used a mix.  Also, you can make the cake ahead of time, so you're not cutting it so close. \n\nI'd try to make it up to her.  Next time is a whole year away, which is forever to kids.  Can you take her to a bakery and get her a fancy pink cupcake?  \n\nJust an idea for next time, maybe bake it with her.

From a box this time.", "YTA. Not for failing to make the cake, but for blindsiding her in front of everyone. You should have pulled her aside and privately explained what happened. She likely still would have been upset, but the sooner you told her, the sooner she\u2019d be able to process that. Instead, you allowed her to get gradually more excited and tell everyone about her pink cake. She was probably completely humiliated.\n\nThis could have been a good teaching moment for the fact that people don\u2019t succeed at things even when they try their best. It\u2019s probably not too late to salvage since this was yesterday, but you owe your daughter an apology.

Ok, you messed up on a number of fronts. You could have tried baking earlier rather than last minute. You could have gone to the store. You definitely should have told your daughter privately before the guests arrived. The latter borders on assholery. But having failed with a cake you made cookies.

Make it a special day for her.", "NTA and if your sis is the selfish one for not understanding you tried. May I suggest premade cake mixes. They are a lot easier then trying to make one from scratch. And your daughter won't remember. Or maybe she'll remember the cookies because at least her dad tried. Who knows maybe she'll remember this fondly and one day want cookies instead of cake.

I\u2019m a single dad. My wife sadly died of breast cancer around 2 years ago. My daughter was only 6 when this happened, and the grief process is tough. But, I guess I can say after 2 years I\u2019m finally coming to terms with her death.\n\nAnyways, my daughters birthday was yesterday. She\u2019s now a 9 year old. \n\nMy daughter told me that she wanted a very pretty pink cake. I told her that I would definitely be making her one.\n\nI have never baked in my life before. I usually buy store bought cakes for birthdays but I wanted this one to be special since she requested it. I should also mention that friends and family were coming over for her birthday.\n\nIt was hell trying to bake that cake. I know I\u2019m not that great of a cook but Jesus Christ I\u2019m a bad baker. I ended up throwing out about 5 cakes because I couldn\u2019t get the measurements right. At this point, I was wasting ingredients and it was getting pretty late and I knew guests would be arriving soon. I didn\u2019t know what to do at that point so I searched up a quick cookie recipe because I figured that would be easier than cakes. I found a simple sugar cookie recipe and managed to make it without messing it up too bad. I made sure to add in pink food coloring and added sprinkles on top though, just to fulfill her requests at least a little bit.\n\nSo, cookies are done. Guests are here. Party\u2019s thriving. The time finally comes to sing happy birthday. My daughter is sitting expectantly at the end of the table and is telling everyone she\u2019s so excited for her pretty pink cake. Imagine her disappointment when I walk out with a tray full of cookies. I lit some candles though so she could still have the experience.\n\nI set the cookies down in front of her and when she looked up at me her sad expression broke me. She asked me where was the pretty pink cake and I told her that I tried my best to make it but this was the only thing I made without messing up. She burst into tears and everybody was staring at me like I had two heads. \n\nShe calmed down and ended up eating the cookies and blowing out the candles though. I thought everything was fine but when she was going to bed she told me she really wanted a pretty pink cake. I told her I was sorry and that I would try my hardest to make her one next time. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning. My sister who was at the party texted me and said that it was selfish of me to not keep trying to make the cake and that I crushed my daughters dreams and she\u2019ll remember this forever. I still haven\u2019t responded to this message because I don\u2019t know how to react to this. I\u2019m feeling pretty heartbroken right now. Is it true that she\u2019ll remember this forever? I\u2019m scared that my daughter will resent me for not making her the cake. She did get very upset about it. It\u2019s starting to really make me wish my wife was still here. Because I know she would reassure me, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve done something wrong.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling confused right now.

This was a fumble, not an AH moment.\n\nThough if you read this OP, maybe you can turn this into something nicer. If you know someone who's good at baking, or someone who knows someone who's good at baking, and they'd be willing to come to your house to give you and your daughter a baking lesson in return for some pay or buying them dinner or something, it could make a nicer daddy & daughter bonding moment to figure out how to make a cake together.", "Yea, I would have just gone to a bakery and got one that was pre-made.
