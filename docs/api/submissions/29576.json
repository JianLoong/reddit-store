No.  Therefore, not hers to grab and eat. \n\nNTA for calling her out.  But if she's this sensitive to being called out for swiping someone else's food, she needs to grow up.", "NTA. Sasha found something that wasn't hers and ate it. Even if she had asked you guys who it belonged to, the fact that she never got consent from the owner still makes her a thief.

Who eats a sandwich that they didn't buy?", "Can you just start using her purse as long as you waive it in front of the office and ask if it belongs to anyone first?  Sasha knew what she was doing and can save those crocodile tears.  NTA, I'd be hangry and out for vengeance if someone ate my lunch.", "NTA she knew it wasn\u2019t hers.

It's not a difficult concept, and calling someone out over it is good practice so long as you weren't well... an asshole about it when you did.", "Nta; she knew it wasn\u2019t hers so she shouldn\u2019t have touched it", "She didn\u2019t know it was yours, but she 100% knew it wasn\u2019t hers. Maybe the embarrassment will make her think twice next time and pack her own lunch like a grown up.", "NTA she knew it wasn\u2019t hers even if she didn\u2019t know it was yours. I also get really really embarrassed about possible social solecisms. So I don\u2019t do shit like eat food from a shared fridge which someone hasn\u2019t handed to me with an offer to eat it.", "Why would you eat something that you didn't pack? That's so strange and... gross. NTA.", "INFO: did your sandwich have a moist maker?", "NTA at all", "NTA people who do this use tears to escape responsibility, youre NEVER at fault for wanting what's yours.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell her she needs to repay you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Her excuse is ridiculous.  What did she expect with half a sandwhich. OF COURSE there is an owner.", "NTA.

Even if it was there for several days and no one claimed it you throw it away, not eat it. \n\nDoes Sasha seem genuine or does she cry so people feel bad confronting her about her behavior? She did apologize and offer to replace it, so she\u2019s only a little bit of an AH. \n\nNTA but nearly N/A/H", "NTA - So what if she cried about it?\n\nWhy on earth was she rooting around in the work fridge unless she brought something to put in there herself? Who does that?\n\nIt's great that she apologized and said she'd get you another one, but that doesn't take away the fact that she was rude enough to take it in the first place. Maybe this has taught her a lesson.", "NTA, it doesn't matter if no one answered, it wasn't hers, she didn't buy it so she had no right to eat it... end of the story....", "NTA, Sasha was rude and deserved to be called out, just because no one claimed the sandwich does not make it hers..", "Nta but she still fine with just eating a random half sandwich? Disgusting", "NTA and even if she did 'wave it around', she knew it wasn't hers. What, does she believe the lunch fairy randomly delivers food to your work fridge? I would have absolutely called her out and asked her to pay for or replace what she took. She can save her crocodile tears.", "NTA. She didn't know whose it was? That's proof that she knew it wasn't hers. You don't eat someone else's food without permission. If she waves it around and no one claims it in that moment, that is not permission. She owes you lunch.", "NTA, No different than stealing from your wallet or purse, the sandwich wasn\u2019t hers to eat. She should replace it, her crocodile tears are just an excuse for her crappy behavior.", "NTA. Sounds like Sasha learned to cry when doing something wrong at a young age in order to get out of taking responsibility for her actions, and carried it on into adulthood.  Screw that. Who the F takes a half eaten sandwich out of a fridge and eats it? Not only that, but if there's only 5 people in the office and if no one else claimed the sandwich (as she said), who does that leave Sasha? Who the F does the sandwich belong to SASHA?\n\nDon't fall for her BS.", "No, NTA", "NTA- Doesn't matter that no one claimed it. It wasn't hers.", "NTA.  What kind of an office staff holds up food they did not bring and asks whose it is?!  They should not be touching food unless it is fridge cleaning day and it needs to be thrown out.  Sharpie the outside of your meals from now on.", "NTA. Her \u201csensitivity and going to tears\u201d is a manipulation technique to put herself in the victim role and gain sympathy for herself  and deflecting owning up to the responsibility of her mistakes.", "NTA. If she's too delicate to cope with being called on stealing someone else's food, she shouldn't be taking other people's food.", "NTA.  She may not have know whose it was, but she knew it was not hers. So, technically, that is theft.", "NTA, lunch thieves are taints.", "Not at all. If it's not hers, why does she have a right to it?", "She may not have known it was yours, but she definitely knew it wasn't hers.\n\nNTA", "That sandwich was last good thing I had going on  in life!  Ross would be on your side lol\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She's not sensitive.  She's rude and manipulative.  Just stay calm and ignore the tears, especially if you have a justified complaint.  It is okay if she is upset.  It's a natural consequence of her own actions.", "NTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be called out, don\u2019t do shitty things. She obviously knew the sandwich belonged to one of her colleagues even if she kinda waved it around.", "NTA. I will never understand how grown adults can see something they did not bring in and take it, whether asking if it was someone's or not. I have had someone steal my lunch before, and it is frustrating.", "Nta - not your fault Sasha is \u201csensitive\u201d to being called out for being a food thief. Why didn\u2019t Sasha bring/get her own lunch? Do random lunches just appear in the fridge for anyone to take? You shouldn\u2019t have to label your food, but in future i suggest you do.", "NTA. Who just grabs sandwiches from the office fridge and helps themselves? Her behavior was ridiculous. Too bad if she feels stupid now.", "MY SANDWICH?!?!", "Is there communal food normally available? If so alright I can understand confusion. If not, you stole it. I can't just tell hey who's car? Nobody? Mine now", "NTA. I really don\u2019t understand why someone would eat food that isnt theirs. You should ask her that", "It wasn't Tasha's sandwich that's all she needed to know.", "NTA. These posts where people steal food at work truly baffle me! I mean, come on. She might not have known it was yours, but she sure as shit knew it wasn't hers. And if someone is overly sensitive about being called out on their inappropriate actions, then they need to not do those actions, period.
