I was in meetings during the lunch hour so I didn't get to it until 1pm and found it gone. Well, the lunch bag was sitting on the counter in the break room but no contents. The issue, other than someone eating my lunch, is that the cafeteria closed at 1pm so I had no way to get any food. Luckily management was on my side and they blasted an email to everyone on the floor stating someone's lunch had been stolen and it caused a medical situation (exaggeration but that was okay!) and that if it ever happened again the \"perpetrator\" would either receive time off without pay or be let go.
