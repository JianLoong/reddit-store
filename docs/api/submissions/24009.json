We\u2019re a lot of people so there\u2019s always chaos. \n\nSo, my stepbrother is a really spoiled kid. This isn\u2019t something I say out of jealousy or whatever, he\u2019s just genuinely spoiled. He has tantrums whenever something doesn\u2019t go his way, he likes so hoard things people need for himself and refuses to give them back (think bags or beach towels that aren\u2019t his) and is rude to everyone, especially my mum. \n\nAs a result, he argues a lot with my mum, his dad and his aunt and uncle. They sometimes yell at him, which is needed and understandable because his behaviour is really bad. However, sometimes when he\u2019s not behaving badly they tease him about things he\u2019s done and laugh about them to his face. They can act very immaturely, and it causes him to act out. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how they expect him to not react. \n\nAnyway, sometimes when he does things I calmly explain to him what he did wrong and how it made people feel and usually it\u2019s all good after that. Today this was happening and I took him aside and spoke to him and it was fine. Later though, my mum and my step aunt came to me and said I had no business doing anything and they had it all under control.\n\nIt\u2019s just that I feel bad for him.

You\u2019re totally looking out for that kid. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s bad, just badly disciplined. The parents are just embarrassed that you\u2019re doing a way better job parenting in ten minutes than they have for 11 years.", "NTA. You are doing a good thing by trying to help your stepbrother understand his actions and their consequences. You are not overstepping your boundaries, you are acting like a caring and responsible sibling. Your mum and step aunt are wrong to criticize you for that. They should be grateful that you are willing to talk to him calmly and respectfully instead of teasing him or ignoring him. Your stepbrother is lucky to have you in his life.", "Wow, nicely done. He\u2019s so lucky to have you. You\u2019re the one in a family full of  adult assholes and idiots who is going to give this kid a fighting chance of becoming a functional and likable adult. Bravo.\n\nNTA", "NTA! Considering ur stepbrother was not upset by it(unlike when the ADULTS gang up on him) This speaks volumes of you as a person and I think you are an amazing person for doing that for him! \u2764\ufe0f At the same time,the adults are upset at u because u are overruling them.(kinda dumb bc they are kinda being toxic :< lol) I think you should talk to them personally abt how they adress his behaviour, esp bc they are doing it in way that makes him lash out more:)\n\nEdit: you are a great sister. Don't doubt yourself because you're not related by blood. All that matters is that you love him and are willing to be a role model in his life and even stick up for him. He should be proud to have someone like u by his side!\ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. You are an adult with your own relationship with your SB.  You don't need their permission to talk with him.  You are doing a great thing for your SB.", "NTA.  You're doing him a kindness.  Not sure how long your mom and step dad have been together but it's a lot to process at that age.\n\nWhat they are doing is abusive.", "NTA and instead a  friend, a big sister, a mentor, and a good person.  You give him honest feedback and recognize the adult misbehavior enables and drives his poor conduct.  When he is old enough to reflect on this, regardless of family structure at the time, he will recognize you were all those things to him and, above all, someone he can trust.  If he does not, at least you can look back and know you were.  Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA \u2014 it sounds like you actually know how to be a good parent. They make it worse by making fun of him. I suspect as he gets older, his friends/peers will call him out for his behavior or will avoid him. Your parents should be working with him so his behavior isn\u2019t so disruptive and he won\u2019t be a social outcast.", "NTA. Your the only level headed parental figure he has. That adult who are supposed to be raising him are using reactional abuse and emotional abuse. That is not okay! His parent have created this issue. Making fun of him, triggers him, then yell at him for being purposely triggered. Instead of them fixing their behavior throw money at the child. I'm sorry you are the only mature person there. I'm sorry he gets left on the outside and is the target of reactional abuse. Healthy families don't do this, they don't target a person like they have him.", "NTA  you sound like the only positive influence in his life. Keep it up your doing nothing wrong", "Someone has to parent the kid. Sad it's not the parents...", "You're being a big brother - that's your job! Older siblings explain things to the younger siblings, help guide them through life. Yes, parents are supposed to do that, but siblings watch out for the younger ones in different ways. For your mom and aunt to tell you you're doing something wrong is idiotic. People yelling at him with no explanation is abusive and not helpful. For them to laugh at his past mistakes, especially with not telling him how it was a mistake to begin with, is bullying.\n\nTell your mom and aunt that you're trying to be the best big brother possible. If they continue to belabor the point, let them know they obvious don't have it handled and they need to get a grip on their own behaviors.\n\nNTA but wow, your family...", "In the entire group you mention, you seem to be the only one NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou show that he doesn't need discipline, but empathy and guidance. Sadly adults seem nit to have core parenting / raising up skills. It's fatal since this is a parentification done on you as you take responsibility of rising that boy. But without you, he would be clueless and in the loop of disfunctional reactions towards erratic behaviour of adults.\n\nIf he listens to you, understands and even accept those information, that's a lot. And you become his compass in this chaos.", "Nta. You're a good big sister.", "NTA. Yet.\n\nYou're supplementing the parental roles of discipline and guidance.\n\nYou are doing so solely because of a perceived weakness in his parents' parenting. Your mother called you out on it. I actually have a hard time telling if you're playing an \"elder sibling explainer\" role or an adult sub-parent role.\n\nYou are not competing with or contradicting the parents in their discipline and guidance.\n\nThe difference between supplementing and competing is if there's mixed messages being sent on whether he's right or wrong or in the consequences. You are not doing that here (not even when the parenting is emotionally abusive, and I do not endorse his parents doing that). In short you are toeing the line. However that doesn't mean your mother can tell the difference.\n\nI believe this is just an isolated misread. Your family tolerates the practice, sometimes. You might be trying to generalize your instruction from more serious to less serious situations, so it's becoming more noticeable. Your mother would be well within her rights to establish a boundary. It does not look like a prohibition.", "CPS time.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's good. NTA.", "Nta at all!! What you are doing is a form of showing him love. He could be acting out for attention in the chaos of all those people. You're showing him love and teaching him empathy.  You're not embarrassing him,  berating him, or hurting his feelings.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like that's what he actually needs.

You\u2019re basically being a caring big sister to him. What\u2019s the saying you catch more flies with honey than vinegar? Talking to him respectfully and treating him like an adult will garner more than mocking him. Perhaps they need to take a page out of your book. The other thing is even though you\u2019re not his bio sister, you\u2019re still family now. Everyone reads stories about horrible step families and how nobody gets along and blah blah blah, it\u2019s nice that you look out for him and that maybe if he\u2019s having troubles he can come to you.", "NTA! Kudos to you for caring enough about him to correct and communicate with him. Don't stop what you are doing! He needs to know someone is in his corner. The adults in your family are AH's!", "NTA you\u2019re just trying to look out for him since if this bad behaviour continues he would get in trouble. And your mom and aunt have no right ne mad at you when you\u2019re just trying to do what they are not doing .", "NTA You are a good stepsister, they didn't have it under control. If they did he wouldn't be spoilt. Also the adults should not be mocking a child. I would be very surprised if he isn't very confused and upset by all of this. He could be going to puberty, confused and then there's all of this happening. It's good he has you.", "NTA. This kid obviously has a big family but it seems like none of them are actually caring for him in ways that truly matter. \n\nThank you for being a good older sibling and looking out for him. Keep showing him kindness like that and he might just turn out okay.", "NTA. I feel bad for both of you. He requires a different approach from the adults in his life. You are the only one willing to step up.", "If you had to step in and do what you did, they did NOT have it under control.

I feel bad for that kid and hope you looking out for them will help in the long run.", "This exactly. They do NOT \"have it under control.\" Heck, it looks like they don't even have THEMSELVES under control. I can't fathom a parent at their ages with other older children that would think their behavior towards an 11yo is appropriate at all.

That\u2019s so sweet of you to say", "I do see him as my brother, but we\u2019re not related by blood, only through marriage. Idk, in my part of the world he\u2019s not really considered as a sibling, especially since our parents got married when I was 12\n\nHonestly, talking to them might make them lash out at me.

In those situations one sibling tends to take the role of protector and the others try and diminish themselves or take the side of the abusers to align themselves with them and so not become the  target.  \n\nThere are a fair number of books and resources that can be used to identify and cope with this as well as how to help deal with the repercussions of living in and growing up in environments like this.  You seem to be mature enough to handle this and start taking some of these steps for yourself and your siblings.
