You\u2019re totally looking out for that kid. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s bad, just badly disciplined.

That adult who are supposed to be raising him are using reactional abuse and emotional abuse. That is not okay! His parent have created this issue. Making fun of him, triggers him, then yell at him for being purposely triggered. Instead of them fixing their behavior throw money at the child. I'm sorry you are the only mature person there. I'm sorry he gets left on the outside and is the target of reactional abuse.

Older siblings explain things to the younger siblings, help guide them through life. Yes, parents are supposed to do that, but siblings watch out for the younger ones in different ways. For your mom and aunt to tell you you're doing something wrong is idiotic. People yelling at him with no explanation is abusive and not helpful. For them to laugh at his past mistakes, especially with not telling him how it was a mistake to begin with, is bullying.\n\nTell your mom and aunt that you're trying to be the best big brother possible.

Sadly adults seem nit to have core parenting / raising up skills. It's fatal since this is a parentification done on you as you take responsibility of rising that boy. But without you, he would be clueless and in the loop of disfunctional reactions towards erratic behaviour of adults.\n\nIf he listens to you, understands and even accept those information, that's a lot. And you become his compass in this chaos.", "Nta. You're a good big sister.", "NTA. Yet.\n\nYou're supplementing the parental roles of discipline and guidance.\n\nYou are doing so solely because of a perceived weakness in his parents' parenting. Your mother called you out on it. I actually have a hard time telling if you're playing an \"elder sibling explainer\" role or an adult sub-parent role.\n\nYou are not competing with or contradicting the parents in their discipline and guidance.\n\nThe difference between supplementing and competing is if there's mixed messages being sent on whether he's right or wrong or in the consequences. You are not doing that here (not even when the parenting is emotionally abusive, and I do not endorse his parents doing that). In short you are toeing the line. However that doesn't mean your mother can tell the difference.\n\nI believe this is just an isolated misread. Your family tolerates the practice, sometimes. You might be trying to generalize your instruction from more serious to less serious situations, so it's becoming more noticeable. Your mother would be well within her rights to establish a boundary.

They became the only people he respected. Because he wasn\u2019t a bad kid, he was lost. And they gave him security, positive attention and boundaries and stayed calm but didn\u2019t let him get away with being awful. \n\nPlus he\u2019s probably going to have a phone or laptop access soon - you can keep in touch.", "What\u2019s helping is you\u2019re doing what they should be doing. Acting like a rational adult.\n\nKeep in touch with him. Maybe a video call once a week. As the others have have said, show him someone who cares.", "NTA", "Is he on the spectrum?", "NTA.  The adults in his life in his life are failing him, especially his dad and your mom, so you have stepped up.  It's a shame that you have had to do that, but good on you for looking our for him.", "I'm gonna be old here and say:\n\nWRITE SOME OLD FASHION LETTERS! \ud83d\udcec\n\nMaybe at least once a month because stamps are expensive as heck!\n\nBut all your siblings can write you something and vice a versa!\n\n\nNTA by the way. \ud83d\ude42", "NTA\n\nA group of adults ages 52, 53, 54 and 56 years old ganging up on an 11 year old child.\n\nGreat adulting. Not. Alternately spoiling and bullying a child. No wonder he's so messed up.\n\nKeep providing some fair consistency in his life. He needs it.", "You're doing great. It sounds like you have a really perceptive and kind head on your shoulders. Try to stay in regular touch with him while you're at uni, if you can, but try not to let the situation rule you too much when you're so far away - it'll be emotionally difficult when you aren't there to help as directly as you would like.", "I would\u2019ve said \u201cif it was under control, then why am I doing this?\u201d  Absolute NTA.  Good on you for looking out for him.", "You\u2019re being a good *sister*. Keep treating him like a human and seriously, good looking out. NTA.\n\nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing. He\u2019ll remember this.", "Of course the aunt and mother would coddle this nasty behavior. NTA OP and sooner or later that stepbrother's filthy behavior is going to lead him down a bad path. Also, we may see another reddit post on another person who's encountered him.", "Exactly. OP, tell your stepbrother he's always welcome to text you if he needs it. And make sure you get back to him, even if it's only a line saying \"sorry, in class, holy shit they're a bunch of idiots, text ya later.\"", "NTA You are a caring person!", "He could blow all his opportunities if they destroy his self-esteem. Just let him know that he can talk to you whenever. You're going to be the cool sister in college. Don't worry about acting like a parent, just respond as a sister who cares about him. He's lucky to have you.", "Not the asshole. My sister has a stepson who came to live with them officially about a year ago. He\u2019s about the same age as your stepbrother. They always pick on him and, like you said, act like everything that comes out of his mouth is wrong. His dad isn\u2019t very gentle either. I try to be soft with him and explain things when they\u2019re wrong, instead of yelling at him or putting him down. I can tell it gets to him when they do that, so I try to step out and be extra nice. Sometimes kids need a person to understand and help them, especially when they aren\u2019t technically getting that elsewhere.", "NTA, it sounds like OP is a better parent than the parents and extended family.", "NTA If anything I applaud you for your very mature approach of how you handle situations with him and I believe that the actual parents need to take a lesson from you. I think they know they are truly in the wrong and they are only upset because it makes them look very immature because of how they handle it!!", "This made me laugh out loud thank you omg", "nta. help him learn as much as you can", "Short periods of time have huge impacts on kids. I was deeply influenced by family members i saw on and off for one summer when i was ten.", "NTA. It's frustrating that your family tease him then wonder why he gets upset. Then tell you they have it under control and not to interfere. It sounds a little immature the way they behave from what you say in the comments as well. I'd recommend having a look at Emotionally Immature Parents, it won't change your family but it may help navigate the situation. You're helping your step bro so much by talking to him about his behaviour.", "He can call you, can't he? NTA"]}
