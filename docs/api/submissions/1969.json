The history of manipulation is too long to get into, so unless someone asks, I won\u2019t get into it.  Her 34 year old daughter planned a small wedding in a beach in Maine, to which none of us (4 siblings and 93 year old father) were invited.  We were invited to a reception on New Year\u2019s Eve, which starts at 8pm, and ends at 1am.  My father goes to bed at 8 o\u2019clock, because he is 93. My sister has said that her daughter, who wants zero to do with any of us, planned all of it and she had no control or influence on any part of it; my niece\u2019s other grandparents were invited to her actual beach wedding last month. \n\nWe received the invitation and responded that we were attending, in fact, all of us were.  There were hard feelings about not being invited to the actual wedding, but nobody bitched about it until my sister texted pictures and videos to group text, and expected lots of positive responses, which she did not get.  She blew a gasket about nobody really responding, and one of my brothers told her he was willing to overlook the initial insult, but after having his face rubbed in the lack of an invitation, with a demand for positive responses, he decided not to travel from a long distance by plane to come to the reception on New Years.  \n\nMy sister then made a special trip to visit my dad, and to tell him that my family also wasn\u2019t coming, even though we said we were-but I had made it clear after the beach wedding that I was insulted too.  I got in touch with my sister and told her that I considered her upsetting statement to my dad as a retraction of my invitation, and that I wasn\u2019t going, either.  AITA?  Or is she?  I should reiterate that my niece never makes any effort to see my dad, even though she lives nearby, and doesn\u2019t ever attend any family functions.  She is also a victim of my sister\u2019s manipulative nature, I think.", "created_utc": 1668088359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrfmjf/aita_for_not_going_to_nieces_wedding/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

HOWEVER, why the hell did you RSVP yes for the reception if you don't think your niece even sees y'all as family? Why complain about it now and blame your sister for your grown-ass niece's decisions? For that you're an AH too. If you don't wanna go, then don't. But since you already said yes, you better contact her directly and tell her you can't go after all for whatever reason. Otherwise you'd be even more of an AH for wasting their money.", "This is kind of confusing. When is the wedding compared to NYE? Are you offended it's on as holiday or that it goes past 8 pm? Because most receptions go past 8 pm and probably aren't planned with grandparents bedtime in mind, if she even knew it.\n\nHaving hard feelings about not going to the wedding is just childish. You don't sound close to the niece. She probably had reasons to keep it small. If you're closer you can ask. If you aren't close, then that's a good reason to keep it to a small group.\n\nYour sister posted pictures of the wedding and got offended by lack of responses so your brother who wasn't insulted by not being invited decided not to attend even though the bride wasn't even the one who sent pictures? Just bailing to punish your sister?\n\nIf your niece doesn't make an effort to see your father, why are you taking that personally? Without knowing distances and job needs, not everyone can easily visit their grandparents especially if they weren't close during her childhood.\n\nESH for during an event into a reason to feud. Don't want to go? Decline. But acting insulted and making a whole statement on it just seems so childish.", "INFO Do you see your niece often? Do you live close to Maine? Is the reception somewhere close to you?", "NTA", "**YTA**\n\nNot for simply not going but because despite trying to paint your sister in a negative light for no apparent reason, YOU are the one who comes across as the epitome of a judgemental, meddling relative who assumes that the whole world revolves around how you think things ought to be done, and who has no respect (much less empathy) for other people's feelings or circumstances. \n\nRight from the outset, you seem determined to make your sister look bad in a post that isn't even about her.  This is about your niece's wedding. Your niece, who is a 34-year-old woman. Your sister is absolutely right that her daughter makes her own decisions, as well she should. Why on earth would a 63-year-old woman be managing the wedding of her grown daughter who is in her mid-thirties? She is a guest, the mother of the bride. That's it. But more importantly, there is nothing WRONG with your niece choosing to have a very small wedding; it's very common at her age, and doesn't indicate a slight against anyone, just a personal preference. Having said that, given how intrusively opinionated you are about OTHER PEOPLE'S WEDDINGS, I'm not entirely surprised that your niece didn't want you there, and if your other family members behave similarly . . . \n\nSimilarly, you seem to think that she's somehow doing something offensive by having an evening reception because your 93-year-old dad \"goes to bed at 8 PM\". It's not his party. Do you actually  think that an entire celebration for someone else should have been planned around a 93-year-old's bedtime schedule? Or is it perhaps more appropriate to say that they understood that he might not be able to attend, but this was the time that made the most sense for them?\n\nI could go on but this is already long. YTA. None of this is about you, and nothing that your niece did is offensive or hateful. But you including unnecessary, gossipy background and trying to control the situation speaks volumes about the sort of person you are and why you are excluded. I'm impressed that she invited you to the post-wedding celebration at all. You sound exhausting.", "NTA. She clearly doesn't want to ge part of the family so why would you go.", "NTA. Why would anybody have a reception on NewYears Eve. Not good enough for the beach wedding not good enough for the NewYears Eve reception.", "INFO\n\nBy small wedding what do you mean? How many guests?", "YTA you weren't invited to the wedding, just a party. You should have just declined if you are insistent on being pissy.", "You said that your niece \"wants zero to do with any of us,\" does not attend family functions, and does not make any effort to visit her 93 year old grandfather even though she lives nearby.  Given these facts, why are you surprised or insulted that your side of the family was not invited to the wedding?  I'm only surprised that you were invited to the reception since she doesn't seem to have a relationship with your side of the family. This seems to be more about your relationship with your sister than about your niece's wedding.  YTA for escalating the situation -- telling your sister that you are insulted and are now longer attending is childish...the kind of fight your expect between adolescents not 60 year old women.

There was no reason for sister to lie to dad about your family's rsvp aside from starting drama. You accepted the reception invite trying to be civil, and sister was any but. I wouldn't want to go either.", "ESH. Your sister is a manipulator and a liar. Perhaps your niece is as well. You're not close to your niece nor your siblings so while you can be upset about not getting invited to her wedding it's hard to understand why you thought you would get an invite to her small ceremony. Your sister definitely is trying to get a reaction by posting pics and videos to a group chat that she knew most participants were not invited to the ceremony. Why did you agree to go to this reception? You should have declined it from the start since you're not close to your niece and have a long standing beef with her mom.", "INFO: I would like to hear about your sister's manipulation and lying, if you're willing. I think it would shed light on the dynamic, and make it clearer to the Y T A people. \n\nI think you're NTA as of right now for not going to the party, SPECIFICALLY because she lied to your father about you not planning to come which does amount to rescinding the invitation. That is kind of a FAFO situation. However, I think that it does edge into E S H a bit because you actively don't get along with your sister and don't see your niece, but you felt entitled to go to her very small wedding. Also, I have to add that having a party to celebrate a wedding that already happened on a holiday is AH behavior on your niece's part. Maybe just say no in the first place in the future, though.\n\nEdited for spelling mistake.", "You RSVP'd you'd attend.  If you don't YTA.\nIt doesn't matter what the daughter planned or the drama, if you RSVP a yes, then you attend. \nStop being part of the drama.", "The wedding has already been-it was in October.  It was planned in a place where it was difficult to get to for our father.  This is something that the other cousins would not have deliberately done.  As for the 8 o\u2019clock reception-just another example of making it difficult for our father to attend.  It appears to the rest of us to be an attempt to make it difficult enough that most of us would decline the invitation to the reception.  Remember, I said that my sister is manipulative-it is her contention that she is the only one of 6 children to be poorly treated (for no reason) by all of us.  Her manipulative nature worked on our mother, who\u2019s been gone for 9 years.", "Thanks-the bride can plan whatever she wants; just don\u2019t offend us and then go and lie to our dad about us declining the invitation, when she knew it was untrue.", "30 people-all of my sister\u2019s in-laws were invited", "He has a right to be pissy because the sister went to the fathers and lied that he declined to go, which isn't true. At that point I would redact my RSVP yes, and not go. The sister made it worse by lying to create more drama.", "So you don\u2019t want to go, it\u2019s a hard time for your father, you think they don\u2019t want you to come, why not just\u2026 decline? I\u2019m with poster who said you sound exhausting. Frankly, your post makes me wonder if sis is correct.", "Maybe she made it different because she doesn't like you and you don't like her. It seems like you think you're innocent in a feud you're keeping going. You don't even like your niece, so don't go. Neither of you apparently want to see each other but you're the one acting indignant that she would date dislike you when you're insulting her.\n\nMostly feels like YTA. All you said the niece did was invite you to an event you didn't want to go to, and all you had to do was decline", "It is New Year's Eve and the cousin is having a reception/New Year's Eve party. Why would they start earlier and have to look at dinnertime interference? Unfortunately one 93 Year old relative is not going to take precedence.", "30 people is a tiny wedding so it sounds like the couple only invited their nearest and dearest to the actual ceremony and then extended to invites to their larger circle for the reception. That's not an AH move. I don't see why you or your family are so insulted and why you couldn't have the good grace to compliment the videos your sister shared. You were, after all, invited to the reception.\n\nYTA BTW.", "Sister would literally have to be right about each one of her 5 siblings and her father, then.  The wedding and reception, from everyone\u2019s perspective, was planned to make it as difficult as possible.  She has a history that I didn\u2019t get into of putting herself in the position of victim of an entire family\u2019s meanness.  Everyone was offended to not be invited to the wedding-not just me.", "Maybe, just maybe, the bride and groom selected the location based around what they wanted for their wedding and didn't give too much thought to what suited the bride's aunts and uncles who she isn't close to.", "So you think a wedding and reception was planned not for the bride and groom, but as a challenge to see how difficult they could make for you and your siblings! Incredible! YTA", "She (the bride) is certainly entitled to have whatever wedding that she wants-my issue is with my sister, who opted to upset our father by telling him that SHE was upset that nobody responded that they were going to the reception, when she knew that everyone with the exception of one brother had already responded they were attending.  That\u2019s the issue.", "Your posts are all over the place. It seems you have an issue with your sister which you're taking out on your niece. Hopefully you can read some of the advice you've been given here and grow tf up. Stop creating unnecessary drama and escalating things.", "ESH.  Wow,  your family is just a drama train running off the rails.   It sucks you didn't get invited to the wedding but as you're a grown adult,  I'm sure you'll manage to move forward with your life.   Your nieces tries to include the whole family for the reception and you all get pissed at her mom and decide you aren't going and you're going to throw a temper tantrum while you're at it.   Phew,  So glad I'm not part of your family.", "NTA\n\n\n\nShe's just a relative not family.  Just ignore her", "YTA\nYour niece is an adult. You should be talking to her about your feelings. It's childish to take things out on your niece when the issue is with your sister.", "NTA\n\nIt's a money/present grab. And your sister made a special trip to complain to daddy? Did she also complain to him that nobody liked her posts on the GC?  \nPoor baby...  \nShe doesn't have a lot of time left in which to grow up.", "You sound exhausting.  It sounds like you are looking for reasons to be upset.  You are taking offense to things that, to the average person, don't appear to have anything to do with you.  And btw, all of your attempts at making your sister look bad, actually does nothing but make you seem worse.  YTA", "That's the part I would be upset about. You can choose to not invite the aunts / uncles if it is a small wedding, but unless he is abusive in some way, how do you not invite your own grandfather? At 93 he might not have been able to go without one of his other kids, but he should have been invited.", "NTA.  Your sister essentially uninvited you so you sure as heck wouldn't feel welcomed.", "NTA. I don't think the niece is an AH for not inviting everyone to the wedding, nor do I think y'all are AHs for being miffed about it considering that you didn't kick up a fuss. The only AH here is your sister, she's delusional to expect a warm response to her photos from people that were excluded. That's so tacky. Going on the attack over it was worse. \n\nI must say it's a bit confusing that your presence at this party is so important it's worth a special trip to tattle to your elderly father, while your presence at the wedding wasn't desired at all. It sounds like your sister is trying to make up for being locked out of the actual wedding planning by packing all the drama into this instead.", "I\u2019m confused. What exactly did your niece do? I get your sister, but what about your niece. You seem to be throwing a fit and all you kept saying was my sister this my sister that.  Why are you being a ah to your niece? Because she isn\u2019t close to you? Because she doesn\u2019t spend enough family time? Have you ever thought her mother is as awful to her as she is to you?", "YTA. Your sister and your niece are not the same person. Stop ascribing the difficult relationship you have with your sister to her daughter-- if her daughter isn't close to your family because of your sister, that's not because her daughter is also (insert negative traits here). If you and your sibling, are distant, of course her children don't have a close relationship with you. And her daughter is not expected to make decisions about her wedding day based off the wants of distant family members. Despite your blood relation being close, you are a distant family member to your neice. You are inherently not the same as the family she's emotionally closer to on the other side-- that doesn't make her a bad person.\n\nYour niece is not responsible for her mother sharing pictures of the wedding with you-- frankly, it would be odd to expect nobody to ever share pictures of a wedding with people who were not invited. Sharing photos with you is not rubbing your nose in your lack of invite. \n\nRegardless of who is right and wrong in the relationship with your sister, you are an asshole for conflating your niece with her mother.", "I think when I originally posted, I was all over the place\u2026I mean, my niece has the right to whatever kind of wedding that she wants, and doesn\u2019t have to care who she offends, if she does.  My beef is exactly as you say-for some reason, my sister wanted our father to know that she was being abused in some way.  Everyone who was invited only to the reception said it was a money grab.  They made it impossible for my father to navigate the place where the wedding was, so didn\u2019t invite him because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get to the beach anyway\u201d-then made the reception very difficult (three siblings live far put of state), and when we all responded \u201cyes\u201d to going, caused a problem for my brother, and lied to our father.  She never wanted us there in the first place, but to get the money/gifts, they had to invite us."]}
