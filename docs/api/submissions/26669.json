I am currently 7-months pregnant with our 3rd child.  This has been by far my worse pregnancy.  Overall health-wise, me and baby are fine, no major issues.  But the general fatigue and discomfort of being pregnant while also having 2 other kids to take care of is wearing on me. I've also had more nausea and terrible heartburn.  \n\nAs a result of me being tired literally all the time, my husband has had to take on a lot of additional household and childcare duties.  He's been great about it and thinks are still running smoothly even though I can do about 1/3 of the household and kid stuff I usually do.  \n\nThis past weekend we attended a wedding for one of my friends from college.  My husband knows a lot of people in this friend group and he was really looking forward to some adult social interaction.  The wedding was a 3 hour drive from our place so he got his parents to babysit and booked a hotel so we wouldn't have to drive home and could enjoy the reception.  \n\nI felt fine all day up until halfway through the reception.  But it was like I hit a wall energy-wise and started getting terrible heartburn.  My husband was off mingling with people while I pretty much just sat at a table for over an hour talking with whoever came by to say hi.  My husband came over to check on me and I told him that I wasn't feeling well and wanted to leave.  \n\nHe asked if I would be comfortable taking the shuttle back to the hotel by myself so that he could stick around and keep socializing.  I told him I want him to come back to the room with me in case I start feeling worse so that he can take care of me.  He didn't protest or argue with me, but he did give a big sigh in the \"Ugh, ok fine\" kind of way.  When we got back to the room, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep immediately.  \n\nHe was short with me all morning as we were getting ready to leave.  A lot of one-word answers kind of stuff.  On the way home I asked him what his deal was and he said he's frustrated that I \"made\" him go back to the room with me only for me to fall asleep.  He said if he knew I was just going to fall asleep, he would have stayed at the reception for longer.  \n\nHe said that this was the first social interaction he's had in months and with the new baby coming, will probably be his last social interaction like that for months again.  I told him that I didn't \"make\" him come back with me, I just told him I wanted him to in case I felt worse.  I also told him my health should be his priority over any social event anyway.  He said that wasn't really giving him a choice because if he stayed, even if I fell asleep right away like I did, I would still hold it against him that he \"chose wrong.\"  \n\nHe said he was just enjoying behaving like an adult instead of a dad for one night and he's allowed to be frustrated that was cut short.  It might just be hormones, but his attitude is making me feel guilty about this.

Yeah, you did make him come back to the room, and yes, you should feel guilty.  You should have let him stay and have some adult time.

You said yourself how much he contributed and leveled up through the past months. You could have taken the shuttle and ask him to have his phone at hand in case you feel worse so you can reach him.\n\nI can understand how he was annoyed, spending the evening alone (you sleeping) in a hotel room, while he was missing out on social interaction.

I anticipate you ruining many more social occasions for everyone.", "YTA. You are a big girl and could've taken the shuttle to the hotel. If you started to feel worse you could've called him.

You ruined his night, YTA.", "YTA- as a woman, I really have to wonder what it is with pregnant women who have mild symptoms thinking they have to be treated like princesses. You're lucky he has picked up the slack as youre having fatigue and some heartburn. Which BTW is resolved by sleep and tums. Most women don't get that kind of support.

Im 33 and just had my 4th child in January. And this last pregnancy was by far the worst that I had! Tums would\u2019ve helped. And if not the doctor prescribes stronger medication.

And I was able to carry out my bridesmaids duties and stay at the reception until 11pm.

I get it but you could\u2019ve gone back by yourself.", "Yta. You had heartburn. Take some Tums and sleep it off. You ruined what sounded like a fun activity for your husband.", "Soft YTA. You didn't physically force him to leave with you but you kind of did emotionally. I get wanting him to take care of you but there's not a lot he can do for tiredness and heartburn. Sleeping it off was probably the best thing for you. Surely as a parent you've had occasions you've been desperate to just be a person and an adult with other adults? I know I have. And the gut punch when you've looked forward to something like that for months and lose the opportunity, it can really flatten you mentally. If he was always out socialising I'd be right with you, but it sounds like he's really stepped up, taking on a lot of the burden with the kids, the house, and if he works as well he probably just needed to unwind and not be \"switched on\".", "Why should he be in the room with you and wait\u2026. For what? \n\nI\u2019m confused. \nYou could have tell him to go back\u2026 or am I missing something..\nTbh you are a grownup person. You\u2019re not going to exactly die with heartburn. You should give your husband a little break. I feel a bit sorry for him tbh.\nThis princess style \u2018looking after me\u2019 is not very necessary.\nPlenty of pregnant women working more then so and so hours a week. Yes they are tired but they don\u2019t act like the princess. They really just carry on.", "YTA. your acting like he doesn\u2019t have emotions too.", "YTA\n\nYou were manipulative and played the pregnancy card. You should have let him stay. It\u2019s 2023, he was just a phone call away if you really really needed him.", "YTA", "NAH\n\nY\u2019all both (I believe?) decided to have kids. Pregnancy is hard. For the person carrying the baby it\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s certainly hard for both people directly involved when a couple decides to have kids.\n\nYour feelings are valid and that feeling of wanting to make sure you\u2019re safe when your body is going through so many changes\u2026 that\u2019s real shit.\n\nBut your husbands feelings are valid too. He\u2019s taken on extra emotional and work burdens. Socialization can be a healer for a lot of people. Sounds like it certainly is for your husband. Being upset he had that cut short against his excitement and expectations about what the day would be like\u2026 he\u2019s allowed space to deal with that and be upset (even directed at you). \n\nThis just seems like a normal couple problem. No assholes. Just people dealing with life being hard and getting upset in a very human way.", "NAH. I sympathized with his frustrations in having to leave early, but understand why you wanted to. Perhaps you could've compromised, and once you were back at the hotel and resting comfortably, told him he could go back to the reception.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His wife (also 7 months pregnant at the time) was aware that he wanted to stay later and socialize esp since he was in the wedding party.  Immediately after dinner (before dessert), she started to feel tired as well and asked him to accompany her to leave back to hotel.  No health issues, just wanted him to accompany her back.  He said no and it led to a fight between the two.  Now keep in mind there were other issues leading up to this day where he felt it was always her way or the highway among other things.  But he always tell us that our wedding day was the day he knew his marriage was over.   \n\nNot saying you two will end up in divorce OP, but continued selfish behavior takes a toll.

Still throwing up, nauseous constantly, the heartburn is so awful I just want to cry. So I get where you're coming from. But you're still being an asshole. It was kind of selfish to ask him to leave the wedding with you, but where i think you really crossed into asshole territory is your reaction to his feelings. You dismissed his feelings, then guilt tripped him by saying your health should be his first priority. Obviously, he cares about your health, he came back to the hotel to take care of you. You should have reacted compassionately when he explained why he was upset. You should have apologized for pulling him from the party and validated his feelings and wanting to have a night to be an adult. But instead you belittled his feelings and tried to make him feel like a bad husband, when you admit he's been nothing short of great.

You were tired and you had heartburn.   What could he have done?  If you were leaving and needed to do anything requiring energy like take care of the kids yes,  but you were going to a hotel, to lay down.   You could have said ok I\u2019m leaving but please keep an eye on your phone in case I feel like you should come.   You gave him no choice, needlessly.", "YTA - I\u2019m currently 19 weeks pregnant. I would have encouraged him to stay. He can\u2019t relieve your heart burn no matter where he is!", "Honestly I have compassion for both sides here. Though he is your husband and baby daddy, doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t also have needs and he is allowed to express those needs. Wanting to feel like an adult to recharge his battery before inviting a new baby into your home is totally reasonable.\n\nYou also being vulnerable and probably also exhausted we\u2019re seeking comfort from someone you trust and didn\u2019t want to feel abandoned. Again valid. \n\nI think what this fight was really saying was:\n\nYou: I am exhausted and pregnant and I don\u2019t think this event is something I can do right now. I would rather be home in comfy clothes and am also craving your affection right now as I\u2019m not feeling the best. \n\nHim: I am feeling a little alienated from myself and still adjusting to what it means to be a dad and also a man. I\u2019m craving adult socialization that doesn\u2019t revolve around my father role and need a night out. \n\nThese two POV are equally valid and ok.  Remember you are individuals who can have differing needs. Most of us don\u2019t know how to communicate like that..hell I don\u2019t. We also tend to amalgamate our needs into our partner and when they don\u2019t share our feelings it hurts. When we don\u2019t know how to communicate we assume the roles we do as children: you wanting ti be cared for and him putting up a wall and icing you out because being defensive/angry is easier than being vulnerable. \n\nYou\u2019re both acting like assholes but I don\u2019t think either of you are assholes.", "YTA.  Sorry but his feelings are valid.  You didn\u2019t need him to be with you.  It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want him to be in the room in case of emergency, but considering what you describe, you most likely knew  there was going to be no emergency.  Heartburn and fatigue isn\u2019t life threatening\u2026so why force him to go with you (which you know you did)?", "OP has left the building.  I love it when people post here and don't get the feedback they want and then they leave.  She will probably go to one of the pregnancy subs and post it there thinking they will be more sympathetic.", "Of course YTA. I really have a hard time trying to sympathize with women who demand to be fluffed in bubble wrap for no good reason. You really couldn't have just gone back yourself?", "I want to say N-A-H but it's clear that it's YTA.    Somewhat light of a YTA since you are pregnant and having these horrible symptoms.\n\nIt is very disingenuous for you to say \"I didn't make you, I just asked you\"  when you know very well how it would have gone had he refused to leave the party.   You would definitely still be holding it against him as he said.   So it wasn't a choice, was it?", "YTA and hubby need to be more assertive and call you out on your BS. You guilted him into leaving the wedding reception early, and he simply caved. You knew he wanted to enjoy the party, so a good compromise would have been to have him accompany you to the hotel, tuck you in and return to the party for another hour or two. Sounds like you are weaponizing your pregnancy to control your husband.", "YTA. i bet this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve gaslighted your husband into doing what you want, and hopefully he gets the sense to reconsider this marriage once he realizes how selfish you are.", ">I told him I want him to come back to the room with me in case I start feeling worse so that he can take care of me.\n\nFor starters, you can start by being honest with yourself. You KNOW what you meant by saying this, you made it sound like you couldn't be by yourself or take the shuttle alone.  If nothing else, stop lying to yourself about your intentions - you wanted to leave and YOU wanted HIM to leave too.\n\nYou should feel guilty. And you should acknowledge your manipulation. You probably genuinely feel crappy, but you have to care about your partner too. You're having a baby, but your husband is still a person who needs to be treated with care and compassion.", "YTA - you are one of these pregnant women who thinks the entire world revolves around you and your pregnancy. Your poor husband - you couldn't give him this ONE time to go have fun while you went back and got some rest. Really. Did it ever occur to you that HE is exhausted and stressed out too? Yes, you bear the physical burden. But his life is changing, too. And you deliberately made everything about you.  As another poster said, you had heartburn. Drink some water. Take a tums. Get over yourself. It sounds like you were bored because people were having fun and no one made YOU the center of attention.", "NTA. Your husband said he wanted to behave \"like an adult\" instead of a dad. Well he failed at both. Priority 1 is being a dad and being a husband, and you don't get days off.", "Wow this comment section fucking sucks.", "Nta. Neither is he. Both of you are valid in your feelings. Its hard being a parent and its rough being pregnant. Maybe you can have some friends over one night while the kids are at grandmas so you can both socialize and have some laughs. It isnt the end of your lives so he will undoubtedly have his opportunity to hang out with his friends again. Just show that you are thankful for his commitment and compassion. Let him know that his actions are not going unseen and thats what makes you love him. He will come around, he sounds like an empathic and good dude. Congrats on baby number 3.", "YTA, yes you made him go with you with \"**I wanted him to in case I felt worse\" -** just because you aren't always feeling well while pregnant doesn't mean he has to take care of you all the time. He deserved time to get to socialize also. Would you take a night away from being mom if you could? if the answer is yes, then he deserves the same. I am a mom of 2 and understand all too well that I do more for my kids in a lot of ways but we all deserve times to be us without being parents.", "YTA you dragged him back guilt tripped him about it then fell asleep. Seriously? You couldn\u2019t handle a shuttle on your own?", "YTA. But you know this already. \nApologize profusely and tell him to arrange a night out with his buddies with no time to get home to make up for it. \nIf you need help that night, get a friend or family member to come and stay with you but you need to give him this for sure. \nIt will really help your marriage. Oh and stop being such a princess. \nYou were tired and had heartburn, not a gun shot wound.", "I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and feel like shit constantly. YTA. This type of shit builds resentment in my opinion. You could have taken the shuttle and CALLED HIM if things got worse. Instead you forced him to leave a rare night \u201cin case\u201d you felt worse and fell asleep immediately.\n\nEdit: if this were a more normal night out. Say dinner in your home town with friends, that would be way different in my opinion\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t. It was a big event that very rarely happens and you knew it was important to him. I understand wanting the comfort of your husband with you, but I truly believe you dropped the ball here.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m going out on a limb and assuming the following: On a regular basis, your husband interacts primarily with you and your children. That means he\u2019s either having very childish conversations OR talking with you about your children OR your pregnancy, your symptoms, how miserable you are with this pregnancy, etc. (I\u2019m not judging you on that btw, I just know that when I was pregnant, the majority of my conversations with my partner were about my pregnancy. There wasn\u2019t much else to talk about besides that and work.)\n\nAll of that said, give the man a break. He finally gets a chance to enjoy himself and adult interaction without kid-talk, and you drag him out of there to do what? Help to burp you if you get heartburn in the hotel room?

I've experienced two terrible pregnancies and they are absolutely debilitating. I say this as someone who has experienced some serious pain -  including a minor surgery without anesthesia- pregnancy and childbirth have been by far the most painful and challenging medical events of my life. Anyone who downplays legitimate pregnancy suffering as \"just\" heartburn or \"minor\" symptoms can gp fuck themselves. The internet's attitude toward pregnant people makes me lose faith in humanity. \n\nOP is justfified in wanting her husband beside her at this late stage in her pregnancy after a physically and mentally straining day. And yes, during a difficult pregnancy just sitting in a chair and socializing for a few hours feels like running a marathon with a hip injury. \n\nHusband's frustration is also justified. Taking care of two kids and a pregnant wife is no small feat. I'm sure he was looking forward to taking off his dad hat and feeling like a human for once. \n\nBoth of you are the A for not communicating your needs in the moment. Instead you let resentment fester and now this conflict is a Whole Thing. You could have compromised where he dropped you off and returned to the party. Moving forward I suggest finding ways for both of you to take a break. You can go out for a massage one weekend and he can go out with his friends the next.

So when everyone was ready to do an entire day of sightseeing, I told my family and husband to go out and have an awesome time. Go see everything. I stayed in the nice, air conditioned hotel, napped, and watched tv with my feet up. He\u2019d call to check in. I told him to enjoy himself.

It\u2019s the considerate thing to do when he\u2019s having such a good time. My husband would do that for me (let me go enjoy myself even when he can\u2019t) so I would want to do it for him. As a compromise, you could have asked him to drive you to the hotel if it wasn\u2019t too far but let him know he was welcome to go back to the reception after dropping you off.

Pregnancy does not require a 24-7 babysitter, especially when you\u2019re not 9 months pregnant / on the verge of going into labor.

He\u2019s managing more responsibilities than he used to, both of your social lives are restricted, etc. but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s complaining about that. He\u2019s just been stepping up like a good man should.\n\nAfter doing things right for 7 months, there\u2019s a social event coming up that you\u2019re both committed to attending, despite the pregnancy. He sees it as a chance to get away from all the stress and responsibilities for one night and just socialize with friends. \n\nHe arranges for the kids to be cared for and spends money on a hotel (which you specifically said was so you both could \u201cenjoy the reception\u201d). \n\nThen after finally getting to the reception he\u2019s been looking forward to, booked a hotel for, drove 3 hours for, he\u2019s asked to leave it early because you said you\u2019d be happier with him there \u201cjust in case\u201d.

It\u2019s actually important for most people\u2019s mental health. He hasn\u2019t socialized in a while, didn\u2019t get to enjoy the chance the wedding provided, and doesn\u2019t know when he will get the chance to again\u2026\n\nYour comment about him prioritizing your health over socializing is really selfish because you said you and the baby\u2019s health is fine.

I know you just \u201casked\u201d but if he had stayed at the reception alone then you would be the one being short the next day and giving one word answers about how he left you by yourself. Anticipating this, he chose to prioritize your feelings over his own. Yet again doing the good husband thing and trying to support you regardless of what he personally desires...\n\nIs he really so wrong for wanting one night without worries and responsibilities? Is he wrong for being disappointed at missing out on something he was looking forward to?\n\nI don\u2019t think so.

It was his only night of socializing with old friends, there wasn't anything you actually wanted him to DO for you, and you did make him leave early, just to sit in a hotel room alone.

He was probably, and reasonably, expecting time to escape a little. This would have been great for him to recharge. However, OP's biology had other ideas. I don't doubt she was miserable and probably wanted nothing more than to relax with her husband. \n\nIt's a tough place to be. Hopefully, you can joke about it in the future. For reference, my wife and I still joke about the time she was too tired to take the older 2 to daycare but I was literally in Taiwan and my outings to help were limited!

I realize people are telling you it was \u201c only\u201d heartburn but I don\u2019t think anyone can really grasp how exhausting carrying a child is and how intense any uncomfortable symptoms can feel at 7 months. Or from day one even! \nOn the other side of the coin, I totally sympathize with your husband because it has to be exhausting for him too taking on 3/4\u2019s of the housework and child care. I was so appreciative to my husband that he took on more responsibility during my pregnancy and I hope I conveyed that to him.. I hope you convey that to yours as well. It is totally reasonable that he was disappointed to have cut his socialization short when he was probably looking forward to letting loose. I was pretty needy of my husbands time and attention as well, there is really not much that can make a pregnant gal comfortable but cuddles help a little! I wanted him close all the time, so I understand why you wanted your hubby to go with you. \nYou both will get past this but maybe have a conversation so you can each come to understand how the other one felt regarding the situation.

You are 3 hours away from home, and you asked him to be there for you. That\u2019s what you do for your spouse.

He is allowed to feel upset and frustrated about the outcome, and you are allowed to have needs and communicatre those.\n\nIMO a lot of comments are unnecessarily rude, saying things like \"most women don't get that kind of support\", does not mean you don't need nor deserve that kind of support. Saying things like \"but I had it worse and still managed to do xyz\" not everyone is the same, not everyone can handle the same things, what takes little amount of effort for someone else, could take tremendous effort from you, because everyone is different.\n\nThat said, you did make your husband leave, and should apologise for that. Neither of you could have known what would happen when you got back to the hotel room, but that doesn't make it okay.

Glorious!", "Omg is it just me or is this thread full of rampant, aggressive misogyny?!\n\nMy vote is: NTA, but this marriage doesn't have great communication either way.\n\nSome thoughts: \n1. Her only stated symptom was heartburn, but clearly this woman felt sick overall. It was *her* friend's wedding, she had to sit out the whole time, and she opted to go home. That person felt sick, whether she detailed symptoms or not.\n2. Folks who haven't been pregnant or dealt with life circumstances that cause you to be sick don't understand the way that illness can cause anxiety. She cited that she wanted support in the event she got worse. This to me means, likely with some experience!, that she felt it possible she could get worse. The stakes of it getting worse are not small- she's a pregnant fucking woman! Who knows where this wedding was, but nowadays they're often in the middle of nowhere in a barn or some shit. Plus, this guy doesn't seem like the type who'd closely monitor his phone in case she was worried. It's scary to be alone, pregnant and sick in an environment where no one you know is around or available in case something happens. \n3. These are not his close friends, or even his friends, they're some folks he knows that are friends of HER friend?? Low stakes wedding to leave, imo.\n4. This shit about this being his last socializing opportunity is a crock of shit. Sure, parenting is hard and intense, but holding this wedding of not-close friends over her head as if it's the last night of his youth is ridiculous. The parents babysat the kids for the wedding, they can find some other ways to support him getting some socializing opportunities. \n5. What is all this in the comments about her being manipulative, jealous?? Wtf guys, can you at least even try to pretend that you don't hate women? What is manipulative about asking someone to go home with you because you're unwell, pregnant, and worrying about getting worse? Women can't ask for help and support? He could have responded by saying, hmm, I'd love to spend some more time, maybe I could [suggestion]. Also what about this strikes you as jealous? It's her friends not his, and she's too unwell to enjoy it. Is she jealous for wanting him to support her through her missing HER friend's wedding, or is he a dick for not caring that she can't enjoy it either???\n6. The best thing here would have been for them to have a conversation that accommodates both needs, and come to a compromise that feels good for both, with no grudges. That might have looked like her going home alone, but him agreeing to check that phone every 20 minutes. Maybe he'd take her home, ensure she's alright, and secure a ride back. But mostly, I think it's a red flag partnership that he is so flippant about his partner not feeling well, in the context of a wedding of folks that are not close. Personally, if my partner was sick enough to ask me to leave with him (and he's not pregnant!), I'd go with him, without a second thought. I'd consider coming back later if it were my best friend or sibling's wedding, but even then, my partner is my partner in all things and my most important person. I'd sacrifice for him.", "After reading several of the comments, I'm afraid to type this out but the way he mentioned getting to \"behave like an adult instead of a dad for one night\" did not hit right with me. You can still have fun and behave like a dad lol. The fact she wanted go to the wedding being 7 months into her pregnancy, sit through a 3 hour drive, to be able to attend the reception demonstrates she is willing to go out of her way to include those fun moments with her husband despite the physical discomfort she may be feeling. OP does not get the leisure to \"behave like an adult instead of being a mom for one night\".  I too would want my significant other to at least accompany me back to the hotel and get me back safely. BUT I do agree that if there was a point where her husband got her back safely and saw she just fell asleep/ was feeling physically fine now being back in the hotel room, that she could have encouraged him to go back to the party while she got some rest. I don't think OP is an A for this but both parties could have encouraged a better outcome.", "Married man here with two kids. You are not an asshole. You are going through a tough time and asked your husband AKA partner for support which he should give. However I do understand his frustration as well. When you have the opportunity to be around other adults that you get along with and get to have a good time it sucks when that gets cut short whatever the reason. The most likely reason why your husband was acting like he was in the morning was because he is both mad at being told to leave, and being mad about leaving when knows your situation. He probably mad at himself for being mad. When things cool off try to have a candid conversation and try to leave the emotions at the door and listen to each other, and don't make it about being right. That just hurts things.", "NTA.

Riding a shuttle bus to the hotel doesn\u2019t sound comfortable to me- maybe he could have driven her home then gone back to the reception for a set period of time. Or maybe OP would have been willing to stay longer if the time was set. \u201cOk, let\u2019s leave in 45 minutes.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, OPs husband shouldn\u2019t have been so cold/aloof the next day.

I didn't see any reason for him to sit at the hospital with me when all I was going to do was sleep. He wasn't drinking just in case he had to get to the hospital and he had his phone on him.

It's one thing to ask him to watch the kids or do some chore beacuse she's too exhausted. But they had a babysitter and a hotel, there was nothing that needed to or even could be done. It was his one chance (since apparently OP is so helpless/unable to parent her own children that he never gets any nights out anymore chances to socialize *ever).* And OP insisted on him leaving with her just in case she maybe needed him to do unclear things to pamper her later.

I'm glad she got a payout.", "Given that the PWFA now treats pregnancy substantively *the same way* as the ADA treats disabilities, I think saying that it\u2019s not a disability because it isn\u2019t under the ADA, when the above comments didn\u2019t mention the ADA, is being a bit pedantic. Like, the US federal government, in passing the PWFA, has essentially acknowledged that pregnancy should be treated as a disability would be in the context of employment.\n\nAlso, while you\u2019re right about the circumstances in which pregnancy can qualify as a disability, your \u201cminority\u201d comment is completely wrong. For years doctors have tried on the ADA to make sure their pregnant patients don\u2019t have to lift X pounds at work (those patients can now point to the PWFA and their baby bump without needing a doctor to assign a pregnancy-caused affliction, but that\u2019s beside the point). Pretty much ALL pregnancies cause some sort of diagnosable physical condition\u2014the issue is whether that interferes with the performance of their job.\n\nAnd that brings me to my final point: the ADA defines \u201cdisability\u201d based on someone\u2019s ability to do their job. So it doesn\u2019t make sense to claim something is definitely not a disability because it isn\u2019t under the ADA, even when it causes conditions that explicitly are ADA disabilities. Some medical conditions inherently interfere in any job\u2014like time off for cancer treatments\u2014but others, like ADHD, are only considered a disability if it interferes with the specific job the disabled person is meant to do.", "It was ranitidine that was recalled:\n\nhttps://www.drugwatch.com/zantac/recall/#:\\~:text=The%20FDA%20requested%20that%20Zantac,%2C%20a%20cancer%2Dcausing%20chemical.", "I\u2019ve never had a full-term pregnancy, and tbf this sounds great to me ALL THE TIME.

The guy is obviously aware of her bullshit since he said to her that if he had left she still would\u2019ve held it against him even though she was asleep.  \n\nI know people like this.  If they can\u2019t go to the basketball game because they have to work, they don\u2019t want their husband to go to the basketball game even though he\u2019s not at work.
