I am currently 7-months pregnant with our 3rd child.  This has been by far my worse pregnancy.  Overall health-wise, me and baby are fine, no major issues.  But the general fatigue and discomfort of being pregnant while also having 2 other kids to take care of is wearing on me. I've also had more nausea and terrible heartburn.  \n\nAs a result of me being tired literally all the time, my husband has had to take on a lot of additional household and childcare duties.  He's been great about it and thinks are still running smoothly even though I can do about 1/3 of the household and kid stuff I usually do.  \n\nThis past weekend we attended a wedding for one of my friends from college.  My husband knows a lot of people in this friend group and he was really looking forward to some adult social interaction.  The wedding was a 3 hour drive from our place so he got his parents to babysit and booked a hotel so we wouldn't have to drive home and could enjoy the reception.  \n\nI felt fine all day up until halfway through the reception.  But it was like I hit a wall energy-wise and started getting terrible heartburn.  My husband was off mingling with people while I pretty much just sat at a table for over an hour talking with whoever came by to say hi.  My husband came over to check on me and I told him that I wasn't feeling well and wanted to leave.  \n\nHe asked if I would be comfortable taking the shuttle back to the hotel by myself so that he could stick around and keep socializing.  I told him I want him to come back to the room with me in case I start feeling worse so that he can take care of me.  He didn't protest or argue with me, but he did give a big sigh in the \"Ugh, ok fine\" kind of way.  When we got back to the room, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep immediately.  \n\nHe was short with me all morning as we were getting ready to leave.  A lot of one-word answers kind of stuff.  On the way home I asked him what his deal was and he said he's frustrated that I \"made\" him go back to the room with me only for me to fall asleep.  He said if he knew I was just going to fall asleep, he would have stayed at the reception for longer.  \n\nHe said that this was the first social interaction he's had in months and with the new baby coming, will probably be his last social interaction like that for months again.  I told him that I didn't \"make\" him come back with me, I just told him I wanted him to in case I felt worse.  I also told him my health should be his priority over any social event anyway.  He said that wasn't really giving him a choice because if he stayed, even if I fell asleep right away like I did, I would still hold it against him that he \"chose wrong.\"  \n\nHe said he was just enjoying behaving like an adult instead of a dad for one night and he's allowed to be frustrated that was cut short.  It might just be hormones, but his attitude is making me feel guilty about this.

Yeah, you did make him come back to the room, and yes, you should feel guilty.  You should have let him stay and have some adult time.  If an emergency arose that required his assistance, there is a marvelous invention called a \\*cell phone.\\*   You could have easily called him if you needed him.", "I cannot understand how you can write all this sotry with the information given without realising that you are indeed the AH here ? \n\nYour husband is your partner, not your servant or your nurse. As much as he is taking care of you (and he is, according to you), you should take care of him, starting by showing a little concern for his emotional wellbeing.", "YTA. You said yourself how much he contributed and leveled up through the past months. You could have taken the shuttle and ask him to have his phone at hand in case you feel worse so you can reach him.\n\nI can understand how he was annoyed, spending the evening alone (you sleeping) in a hotel room, while he was missing out on social interaction. Honestly, I probably would have written a note and left, going back to the wedding, but that\u2019s me being petty.", "YTA.\n\n\"I told him I want him to come back to the room with me in case I start feeling worse so that he can take care of me.\" - yea, I mean, did you \\*make\\* him? No, you didn't push him out of the reception.\n\n\"I told him that I didn't \"make\" him come back with me, I just told him I wanted him to in case I felt worse**. I also told him my health should be his priority over any social event anyway**.\" - so, didn't make him but sure applied a ton of emotional pressure to get the outcome you wanted. \n\nWell, you didn't give him much of an option to say no without him feeling horrible about it bc then he'd have to likely hear about it if he \\*hadn't\\* come back. \n\nClearly this event was meaningful to him - and his reasons are valid.", "YTA. You had heartburn, ffs. You weren't dying. You ruined his night, and it sounds like you did it out of jealousy and selfishness.", "YTA You had heartburn.  What exactly would \"taking care of you\" entail?\"\n\nI feel sorry for your husband.  I can only imagine what his day-to-day life is like living with a princess.", "YTA - I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t feel great, but that\u2019s no reason to make him go back to the room and stare at you. You can be tired and queasy alone for a few hours", "Well YTA.  If you can\u2019t deal with heartburn solo, I have grave concerns of you dealing with the children. I anticipate you ruining many more social occasions for everyone.", "YTA. You are a big girl and could've taken the shuttle to the hotel. If you started to feel worse you could've called him. Seems like this night meant a lot to him and you could care less. Yes, you are pregnant but it doesn't mean he is there to be your handmaid. You ruined his night, YTA.", "YTA- as a woman, I really have to wonder what it is with pregnant women who have mild symptoms thinking they have to be treated like princesses. You're lucky he has picked up the slack as youre having fatigue and some heartburn. Which BTW is resolved by sleep and tums. Most women don't get that kind of support. Judging by your precious princess act while you're pregnant The guy deserved a little socializing. He is going to be neck deep in diapers while you complain about your fatigue after that baby is born. Do your marriage a favor get those tubes tied honey.", "YTA. Agree with all comments here. Don't have anymore kids.", "YTA\n\nWe all know take care of you means cater to you and tbh, what could he have possibly done for you that a phone call to reception couldn\u2019t have handled?  So glad you guys drove three hours and got a hotel room for him to watch you sleep.", "YTA.  So big of an AH.  And a baby too.", "YTA... you made him leave because you MIGHT feel worse later. And if you felt worse what was he going to do? Grab you some water?", "YTA. You made him leave for no good reason. Apologize.", "YTA - Sounds like your husband has an extra baby in the house.  And yes, you DID make him come back - you didnt give him any other choice: \"I told him I want him to come back to the room with me in case I start feeling worse so that he can take care of me.\"\n\nWah wah wah.", "YTA. Im 33 and just had my 4th child in January. And this last pregnancy was by far the worst that I had! Tums would\u2019ve helped. And if not the doctor prescribes stronger medication. I know because they did for me. And I have been in an wedding with my 3rd and I was high risk too because she has turners. And I was able to carry out my bridesmaids duties and stay at the reception until 11pm. I have packed appropriately for my needs because it wasn\u2019t new for me. \n\nHonestly, I think you wanted to go to bed because of the exhaustion.  I get it but you could\u2019ve gone back by yourself.", "Yta. You had heartburn. Take some Tums and sleep it off. You ruined what sounded like a fun activity for your husband.", "Soft YTA. You didn't physically force him to leave with you but you kind of did emotionally. I get wanting him to take care of you but there's not a lot he can do for tiredness and heartburn. Sleeping it off was probably the best thing for you. Surely as a parent you've had occasions you've been desperate to just be a person and an adult with other adults? I know I have. And the gut punch when you've looked forward to something like that for months and lose the opportunity, it can really flatten you mentally. If he was always out socialising I'd be right with you, but it sounds like he's really stepped up, taking on a lot of the burden with the kids, the house, and if he works as well he probably just needed to unwind and not be \"switched on\".", "Why should he be in the room with you and wait\u2026. For what? \n\nI\u2019m confused. \nYou could have tell him to go back\u2026 or am I missing something..\nTbh you are a grownup person. You\u2019re not going to exactly die with heartburn. You should give your husband a little break. I feel a bit sorry for him tbh.\nThis princess style \u2018looking after me\u2019 is not very necessary.\nPlenty of pregnant women working more then so and so hours a week. Yes they are tired but they don\u2019t act like the princess. They really just carry on.", "YTA. your acting like he doesn\u2019t have emotions too.", "YTA\n\nYou were manipulative and played the pregnancy card. You should have let him stay. It\u2019s 2023, he was just a phone call away if you really really needed him.", "YTA", "NAH\n\nY\u2019all both (I believe?) decided to have kids. Pregnancy is hard. For the person carrying the baby it\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s certainly hard for both people directly involved when a couple decides to have kids.\n\nYour feelings are valid and that feeling of wanting to make sure you\u2019re safe when your body is going through so many changes\u2026 that\u2019s real shit.\n\nBut your husbands feelings are valid too. He\u2019s taken on extra emotional and work burdens. Socialization can be a healer for a lot of people. Sounds like it certainly is for your husband. Being upset he had that cut short against his excitement and expectations about what the day would be like\u2026 he\u2019s allowed space to deal with that and be upset (even directed at you). \n\nThis just seems like a normal couple problem. No assholes. Just people dealing with life being hard and getting upset in a very human way.", "NAH. I sympathized with his frustrations in having to leave early, but understand why you wanted to. Perhaps you could've compromised, and once you were back at the hotel and resting comfortably, told him he could go back to the reception.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
