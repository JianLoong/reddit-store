They both went on with their lives each remarrying.  In 2016 my father had a stroke that fully debilitated him, to which he went into a nursing home.  He passed away a few weeks ago.  When he went into the nursing home, he didn't have much.  Just a few pieces of furniture and personal items.  At that time my siblings and I divided that up.  He was divorced by his 2nd wife at this time, so their wasn't much to worry with there.  We never expected dad to have any money or an estate after this point, but last week I received a call from the nursing home that he had a substantial bank account.  (He was full VA disabled and drew a monthly SS check).  Imagine my surprise that he has just under 70k in a bank account.   I am close to my mother and was just sharing my shock of the account when she pipes up, she should get a portion of that.  Her exact words \"He never paid child support and I struggled every day raising you\".  Well she did struggle due to her spending habits, but she received a stipend from the government on each of us kids. So no technically she never received child support but she was getting a payment.  There are 3 children total to divide this 70k in question, his funeral was just under 10k, plus we need to hire a probate attorney.  So each of us will get just under 20k each.....AITA for denying her any portion of this money?

DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT give your mother a damn dime! This money belongs to you and your siblings! If it was meant for your mother the nursing home would have called her and not you. She had a spending habit and I would almost bet you and you siblings were not the recipients of most of those sprees? They had been divorced for years and your father had already gone thru a second marriage as well. Yeah. Not happening in my book. Tell your mum to kick rocks and let her go cry to her family that her kids are being mean. Remember when there\u2019s a death there\u2019s a vulture. NTA by 1000! This is a few months after I lost my own mum as well. She would have NEVER asked for a damn dime!!", "NTA. She deserves nothing and is putting you in an unfair position by even asking.", "NTA\n\nNot only was she divorced from him, but he had remarried and divorced again. It\u2019s not hers. If he had wanted her to have it, he could have easily left it in a will. He didn\u2019t.\nAs for, \u201cBut I raised you!,\u201d what kind of mom demands her kids\u2019 money? And demands payment for having raised her kids?", "Considering child support would have gone to support you, and your mother blew what the state gave her to help cover you, I\u2019m not sure giving her any would matter other than her wanting to blow the money.", "NTA - I personally would give my mum something if my dad happens to leave cash to me on his death, but that\u2019s only because she genuinely did struggle as a single mum for basically my whole 24 years of life (and she spent 8-9 of those with my dad lmao). I\u2019ve seen her struggle, every penny always went to me and my sister, she would go hungry for days to make sure we were sorted. She went to bingo one night and won \u00a3100, but felt so guilty because she spent \u00a310 on the bingo in the first place\ud83e\udd7a if however she wasn\u2019t like that, I absolutely wouldn\u2019t give her a thing", "NTA. I mean sharing your inheritance is fully at your discretion and it sounds like you don\u2019t think she deserves some of it, which she probably doesn\u2019t. She isn\u2019t legally or morally entitled to it. I\u2019m kind of surprised she\u2019d even ask or pull the \u201cI raised you without receiving child support\u201d card. Take her to dinner, take some time to grieve for your late father, and enjoy your inheritance.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is wrong. Child support belongs to the children, which are you and your siblings.", "NTA.  She is not entitled to that money.", "Nta, child support is money to be used on you, so by her own logic the money is yours...", "NTA, she is not one of his heirs.", "If she actually needed some financial help I would offer, but if it's just so she can go shopping then no.

Should that be the case your mum did collect support for you and possibly her as well. Would your mum be entitled to spouse\u2019s benefits now that your father has passed? There is a good chance that answer is no but tell her to ask regardless.", "Thanks for all the upvotes! My first!", "I would give my Mom 100% of the money if I got any from my biological father.

When your parents divorced, she lost those rights, full stop. If she wants to cut you off or try any emotional blackmail over this you need to shut that down. Get some therapy for boundaries - I had to do the same before my dad died because my brother is terrible with money and thinks he deserves more for whatever reason. Finding out the therapist was horrified by previous incidents that remain unresolved between us helped a lot!

My sister received a benefit check for my niece after niece's veteran father had a stroke and became disabled. Just because niece's father didn't write the check doesn't make it any less than what it is, child support.\n\nNTA, in any case. After 35 years, she shouldn't expect any inheritance.", "Buy her a box of candy. NTA.", "NTA but your mom is.", "That they did not. I spoke to my son who was in the Navy and was informed the mother does NOT qualify for spousal benefits as they were divorced. It does not matter if they have kids.
