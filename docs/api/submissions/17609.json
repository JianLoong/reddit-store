Mike is now 21\n\nUnless he's been judged incompetent, and you were appointed his conservator, you are no longer his legal guardian. Next of kin, perhaps, but not guardian.\n\nYou have no legal right to seize and sell his belongings. You can ask, but you need his consent.\n\nIf he's been unable to hold a job for years, has he applied for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits? I know it's insanely hard to qualify, but they are intended for situations like what you describe.", "YTA\n\n>After months of deliberation, I decided to sell his comic book collection to fund his therapy.\n\nSurely in this time frame you could have discussed this option with him? Since you didn't mention any conversation, I assume none took place.\n\nI get that you surely are exhausted and frustrated, but they were his comics, and you had no right to decide for him what was to happen.", "YTA. Look i get the situation and your position but you didnt ask or have a talk with him about it but just trow this info without any regard or input on his part, thats the problem.", "Info: did you ever both to have a conversation with your brother about selling the comic? Or did you just decided for him?", "YTA \n\nThey weren\u2019t yours to sell and he\u2019s an adult so if you could have discussed the options with Mike about treatments and costs and left the decision up to him.", "YTA \n\nIt was not your property to sell.", "YTA this is theft. Yes, you are trying to care for him, but he needs to have a say in it. You could have done the research and asked him.  Given him alternatives. Set boundaries. \n\nThat said, please set boundaries now so that things are more sustainable. You are not his parent.", "YTA.\n\nI understand you are desperate. However, this sounds like it\u2019s coming from a place with very little understanding of depression.\n\nPart of struggling with depression is struggling with control. Depression is an illness that often distorts what is and isn\u2019t in someone\u2019s power. It also tends to make people focus on the wrong and/or unhealthy thing. \n\nTreatment for depression works best with a willing participant. Someone needs to want to get better. Medication and over treatments don\u2019t cure depression - they make things bearable enough to do the hard work. \n\nSometimes success is rewiring the brain and knowing your triggers so that depression is less likely to return. Sometimes it\u2019s living with the voice or urges inside your head and having the strength and skills to not prioritize them. \n\nThe hard truth is your brother feels out of control and your answer to that was to take more control away from him. Selling the comics needed to be his choice, or at the very least he needed to be heard before making the decision. \n\nDoing something like this confirms the worse fears of someone with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It feeds into the negative thoughts that he struggles with.\n\nIf the point of this was to get him help is he now getting that help? Is he talking to other doctors? Do you have permission to talk to his doctors? \n\nPlease apologize to your brother unconditionally. Emphasize how much you love him and show him to understand bot only how much you messed up but *why* it was the wrong move.\n\nI\u2019m sorry things are so hard.", "You're also struggling so I'll not be harsh. \n\nYes YTA - it was his and he deserved input and to give consent. He's a legal adult now, his choices need to respected.\n\nYou're in a desperate spot, but you have to balance the fear and panic for these decisions with his needs too.  He hasn't touched them -- he also hasn't been the same. You don't remove important things from his life, that won't help him or his mental health.\n\nI know you're desperate for money to fund his care. Can he qualify for disability due to his inability to work? I'm sorry for you both, and i'm sorry for your loss. Good job taking care of him and trying your best. This was an error in judgment, and I get the reasoning behind it.\n\nI don't know how you fix this, if you try to buy back one of the comics or find something else he had a connection to your parents with. Also please reach out to all the agencies who may be able to provide support to you guys.\n\nYou matter too OP, as does your brother. This was a bad choice, but I can see how it was the only choice. You needed his permission, to give him some control and agency over his life. Wishing you both the best. You both deserve some peace and happiness, and some easier days.", "NTA yeah you should've talked to him before but we all know he wouldn't have let you and you STILL would've been stuck paying for everything.

Obviously he thought you should take on a third, fourth, or fifth job to keep supporting him. If you broke down and collapsed would he be there picking you up. Hell no. As hard as it is cut the apron strings. It is past time he takes care of himself. And for those who say he can\u2019t. You are so wrong. My own granddaughter has exactly what he has and more. Same age but a functioning member of society because she gets up every day and works at it", "YTA. Robbing your brother of what agency he has is not the way to improve his mental health.

Truth of the matter is that you didn\u2019t do it for him, you did it for yourself to ease the burden on YOU.", "INFO: The collection is worth $50k, how much did you actually sell it for?\n\nHas your brother been provided his money from the sale of his property? All of it?\n\nDid you create/keep any receipts or bill of sale for these items?", "NTA - I'll be downvoted for this but he's 21, unable to hold down a job to pay for his treatment and has been relying on you to pay for it. By the logic of almost everyone on this thread, since OP can't afford it, maybe they're better off cutting their brother's treatment off. OP your brother needs help and if this is the only way to afford it, then so be it.", "YTA. But only for deciding to sell the collection without discussing it with him.\n\nSounds like one mistake from someone who otherwise has been a really supportive older sister.", "YTA that really, REALLY needed to be discussed with Mike first.\n\nI also do not agree with your decision. I don't trust that five years from now, the situation will be any better than it was today--you'll be broke again, and your brother will still need specialized care, but will not have his comic book collection.", "I understand this is an extremely hard situation for you. You're provide for him financially, you can't see a way out of this, while he's sitting on fifty grand with of comics he doesn't even read. It's not clear from your post of your sold them first. It wasn't a good way of handling this if you did. NTA anyway.", "NAH, and I\u2019m very disappointed in all the people who are being so harsh with you.  While I agree it would have been better to at least discuss things with him first (so he would be prepared for it, or to give him a chance to think of a different solution) you are under incredible amounts of stress and I believe your priorities are correct.  \n\nYou were orphaned and appointed a legal guardian to your brother when you were barely an adult yourself.  You are already working two jobs, and I\u2019m sure you had to sacrifice a lot of things, such as a social life, all for the sake of your brother.  That is a huge amount of strength and selflessness that few are capable of.  \n\nAnd even with this, you only sold the comics because it was money *he* needed.  Your brother is a legal adult.  But if he is dependent on you, if you are taking care of him, and there\u2019s no other way to get the money for what he needs, then what else were you supposed to do?  I\u2019d like to see the other commenters do better in your situation.", "You do not have the right to sell them however you do have the right to expect Mike not to live at your expense. What is his solution ?  How is he going to pay for himself? \n\nPerhaps he can sell some of them? But the problem needs putting back in his hands along with paying his way. \n\nYou are NTA for getting to a point of expecting him to contribute. So set some firm boundaries.", "If you live in US, apply for disability and Medicaid waiver. Your brother should qualify for assistance.

Also, they will help pay for things that insurance will not.", "YTA if you sold the comics without prior discussion and warning. \n\nE S H if you did have prior discussions but your brother refused to acknowledge the very difficult financial reality that you are both facing together, and that he too, needs to pitch in to help now as an adult.\n\nPersonally I suspect the first because of how your framed your post.", "The collection was not yours to sell for **any** reason and the loss might make your brother's depression even worse. You might have destroyed your relationship with him as well. You are a massive asshole.", "YTA you stole from\nHim", "The best thing you could do was discuss it with him before, rather than after.

Also, your alternative at this point was to abandon him as you cannot continue on this way financially. I can understand not wanting to abandon him. I understand thinking you were helping him. You still screwed up. You needed to present him with his options. You are not his guardian. You are not responsible for him. He gets to make his own choices.

You've been processing your own trauma WHILE supporting your younger brother for six years... its a terrible situation, and yes you probably should have given him a heads up, but I can't fault you for it.

My younger brother (let's call him Mike) and I (27F) lost our parents when I was 21 and he was 15, and I've been his legal guardian ever since. Mike is now 21, has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. \n\nGrowing up, Mike was a massive comic book fan, with our parents supporting his hobby. By the time they passed, he had a collection worth around $50,000. Mike's passion for comics faded after our parents' death, and he hasn't touched his collection in years. \n\nDue to his mental health, Mike hasn't been able to hold down a job, and he's been relying on me for everything. I work two jobs just to keep us afloat, but his recent diagnosis needs specialized care which I can't afford. After months of deliberation, I decided to sell his comic book collection to fund his therapy.\n\nI told Mike about my decision and he was furious. He said those comics were the last connection he had with our parents and that I had no right to sell them. I tried explaining the situation, that his mental health is more important than some old comics, but he's not having any of it.\n\nI feel guilty and horrible, but I also feel like this was the best thing I could do for him. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You just decided to go ahead and sell off his possessions. Did it ever occur to you to, oh idk, maybe TALK to your brother first before just making this decision? \n\nYou're N-T-A for needing him to start contributing but 100% TA for unilaterally deciding that this is how he'll be contributing.", "Oof.\n\nLook, selling something meaningful to someone without their consent is pretty much always going to be a YTA. You should have talked to Mike and worked out a solution to afford his therapy together. He's an adult, he can take responsibility for his own mental health. It may have genuinely been the only option but he deserves to make that decision himself.", "This whole situation sucks. You were thrust into parenting a teenager, barely beyond teenhood yourself. \n\nI don't know what I'd do, around here at least we have some financial support, I'd avoid selling those comics though. Especially as they're his last connection to your parents. Was there *really* no other way?", "YTA for selling without his permission, I would be furious. HOWEVER, I understand why you did. He is 21 years old relying on you to take care of him. It doesn\u2019t sound like he has any plans to do anything. He can\u2019t bum off his older sister for the rest of his life. What does he expect to happen? He gets to sit at home doing nothing with 50K of comics sitting around while you bust your ass working two jobs? That\u2019s not okay and you\u2019re getting taken advantage of. Again, it should have been discussed first - if he said no, you should have asked him what he expects, to live on the streets with his comics? You should have allowed him to make the choice himself. If he wanted to be homeless with his comics, that\u2019s on him. He\u2019d sell them for food soon enough. At least then he couldn\u2019t blame you.", "YTA. He\u2019s a adult.

I'm also willing to bet you don't know as much as him about comics and their value so probably sold them for less than their worth.\n\nAlso to make things worse you obviously knew he wasn't going to be happy with this right?

If the brother actually can\u2019t function, then OP could have petitioned for guardianship to legally make decisions for him until he is better able to function. If her brother was actually diagnosed with real mental health problems of the severity she implies (but weirdly gives no specifics), and was involved in her brother\u2019s care, she 100% would have been advised of this (if she wasn\u2019t already aware of herself). She didn\u2019t do anything other than spending months plotting to steal his $50K and attempt to force him to receive treatment that he doesn\u2019t want. Also, by fucking him over like this, she undoubtedly made his issues worse.", "YTA. Not for wanting to sell his collection but for doing it without telling him.

What an awful thing to do to your brother. \n\nThere is no excuse for what you did. \n\nI hope he doesn\u2019t do something rash because you are horrible. Any good will you earned in caring for him was erased the second you took from him like that. \n\nThis is inexcusable and unforgivable.", "Reach out to a SNAP Benefits (if you are in the States) organization or ask the Free Clinics for some help. They often know of places that help with free or discounted mental health help. There are other options. I won't outright call you an AH because you are in a darn tight spot. But selling the last connection he had with your parents is something awful. I am going to say a soft ESH. And I mean very soft. There is help out there. Please seek it out.

She likely is going to set back any progress he\u2019s been making. \n\nIt\u2019s not even necessarily the comic books. It\u2019s severing his autonomy, its disrespectful, it\u2019s taking away his security by allowing him zero input and it\u2019s breaking his trust that he (and his belongings) are safe with you. \n\nYTA OP", "Yess thank youu\nWhy are people so heartless??? Jumping down OP's throat, saying they hope her brother throws her in jail???? She has literally been taking care of him for so long, she has made immense sacrifices and doing the most she can. I feel for the brother for having lost such a sentimental collection but what other option is there... is she more correct in having that conversation and then still selling it because the brother refuses? Or is it better she kicks him out completely... as long as it's not \"theft\" I suppose. Such absurdity", "Yeah, all the people saying they \u201caren\u2019t his legal guardian because he is 21\u201d are correct. Kick him out. Give home the money.

They are his comics, this is his care, he deserved a chance to participate in this decision. Like maybe he could have selected a few to keep, maybe he would have been able to prepare himself and understand if you\u2019d given him the chance.
