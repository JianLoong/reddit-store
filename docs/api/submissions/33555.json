{"id": 33555, "submission_id": "18ogsly", "title": "AITA for putting my foot down and not adding my husband to the deed?", "selftext": "Background- I (29F) have known and been with my husband (33M) for past 4 years and married for 2 years.\n\nI started working when I was 21 right after my bachelor\u2019s degree. After 2 years of working. I bought myself a house. Nothing fancy. I bought the land and built the house. It is a 3 bedroom 2 floor house.\n\nI got to know and date my husband in 2019. The construction of my house had finished by then. He lived in a different country. So when he visited me, I took him to show my house. I am very proud of it. It is something I built with my own money and I own it. However, small.\n\nAfter our wedding I moved to the country where he was already staying. We split our bills and rent equally. We both work in IT and earn pretty good. So we are planning to buy a house. We found a place we liked and can afford. We are putting both our names to the deed because both of us are paying for it together. The problem arose when he said he wanted his name added to the house I bought by myself. I am not comfortable doing that. And I said so. He said it\u2019s unfair that I have 2 now and he would have part on one. I said it was his bad plan for not buying a house before. I bought that house before I knew he existed and with my own money. Since he had no contribution to it, I am not obligated to make him feel good by adding him to deeds. He then proceeded to call his family. While his sister and BIL support me, his mom and dad said that it\u2019s not about money but it\u2019s about the togetherness and whatever it is should be for the both of us or none. I said I am sorry, but this is not happening. He will never be in the deed even if he pays his share (which he and his family thinks he should not because it\u2019s \u201cours\u201d not mine or his) because I know how much I struggled to have that house and make it happen. Now his mom and dad are saying I disrespected them by saying this. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Both of us are from the same country. We are on a visa in a different country and we work there. We are planning to buy a house where we work on visa. We are allowed to do that. We are planning to stay for 5 more years at least so buying a house made it seem logical. In my country, we don\u2019t have a prenup culture. I did tell him earlier that this was mine and I won\u2019t ever give it to anyone. Unless I am dead in which case it will go to either my kids(if I have any) or the charity.\n\nEdit 2: because someone pointed this out - my husband\u2019s family has generational wealth. I don\u2019t. He has never depended on me for anything. We married because we loved each other. It has nothing do to with money at least in my case. \n\nEdit 3: I am sorry if it looks like I am entitled when I say that I bought the land from my dad in a comment. I did buy it from him for real cheap but I paid off all the construction cost, material cost, labour cost etc by myself. I even plastered and painted the walls myself when I was a little low on money. I think this makes it valid for me to be proud of what I did. I from a developing country and I am sorry that you have to shit on me if just the land came for cheap and I paid and did everything. I have been cut tiles myself and mixed paints and watered the cement. So hell yeah I am proud and have emotional attachment to that place\n\nEdit 4: I am not in US. Any property I own before marriage or after, if it has my name on the deeds, it belongs to me alone. I can choose to register it in anyone else\u2019s name if I want to or register a POA or register someone as co owner later. But, it\u2019s completely up to my discretion.

A solid one. Because if you two divorce, he will go after your house for sure.

You are prudent to keep control of your separate property. However, your husband is sending up huge red flags. First, he knows he didn\u2019t contribute to your house, so why would he expect to be an owner? The obvious answer is that he wants to control your assets.\n\nThe argument that you have two houses is stupid. You have one and an interest in a second. He has an interest in one. This is because you bought one and are sharing the cost of a second. \n\nA big red flag for me is the fact that he complained to his parents. Your husband and his parents all sound greedy. They want property that they didn\u2019t contribute to. This is giving off a major gold digger vibe. \n\nThe only reasons that it would matter whether your husband\u2019s name is on the deed are \n\n* If you die, he wants to take the house.\n* If the property is rented or sold, and he\u2019s on the deed, you would need his agreement to rent or sell the house, and he would be entitled to share the money.\n* If you divorce, he gets a share of the house\u2019s value.\n* If he has debts and is on the deed, the house could be seized.\n\nIn short, having him on the deed gives you less control over your property, makes you less financially secure, and actually rewards him if you dueor divorce.\n\nAre you sure you want to stay married to this guy? It sounds like he\u2019s planning ways to take your property. He\u2019s already enlisted his parents to pressure you.

Do not allow your husband or any of his family members to perform any repair, cleaning, or upkeep on the house or stay in it unless he/they are paid for it or pay for it respectively and it\u2019s clear they are a documented contractor or lodger and make sure they agree that they\u2019ve been paid in full and they cannot put a lien on the property. It\u2019s probably lower legal risk if your husband and his family have nothing to do with that property, but that should be something you discuss and work out with your lawyer in order to best protect yourself and your interests.\n\nYou may be able to negotiate a post nuptial agreement if you did not have a prenuptial agreement in place, depending on the applicable laws and the legal advice you get from your lawyer.\n\nMake sure your lawyer is fully licensed and accredited/registered/credentialed to practice law in the applicable jurisdictions and that you verify s/he and their firm have solid adequate relevant current valid legal malpractice insurance coverage in place that would cover losses you incur if they provide you with erroneous guidance or representation and you incur losses because of this.\n\nGiven the complexity and the variety of messy issues presented by your situation and needs, it\u2019s critical you confer with a good lawyer as soon as possible if you want to try to manage risk and best make informed decisions and protect yourself.\n\nAs others have pointed out, this is not a legal advice sub nor is it likely or possible the depth and breadth of legal analysis and advice and representation you need could be obtained through the internet and/or on reddit.\n\nGood luck, OP!", "Oh hell no.

Somehow as the man, he shouldn\u2019t even dare ask the woman to contribute to a house he bought on his own. The double standard is hilarious.", "ESH. Imagine if the roles were reversed", "So I was in your shoes as far as owning a house prior to my marriage. My husband never pressed the issue of getting his name put on the deed. I don\u2019t know that I would have for a little while anyway. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t trust him. It was just security for me. However, I would have put him in the will to inherit my house. I think your bigger problem is your husband took your issues and talked to his family when this didn\u2019t concern them. I did end up selling my house, and the new house has both our names on it. The money I made from the sale of my house I did put in our joint account. I felt comfortable doing so with how much my husband contributes and takes care of all of us. He is in no way greedy, or made me feel like I owe him some thing as a now stay at home mom. He contributed to the household so I thought it was only fair since we now have our new house and both are on the deed. \n\nI think more discussion should\u2019ve happened on whether or not you would eventually put him on the deed. I mean, how would he feel if he owned an antique car worth a lot as some are prior to your marriage and suddenly you wanted the same ownership to that car? Say he let you use it on occasion and you would take it for an oil change or tuneup and put gas in it. You\u2019re contributing to that car but it still is his and was only his before marriage. I know people say a house and car are different, but it was still acquired prior to the marriage and both can be valuable in this instance. People should not get married and expect things to become theirs directly after the marriage if their spouse already owned it prior to the marriage. That\u2019s where important conversations need to be taken place and the precedent needs to be set early on with expectations. It sounds like you and your husband did not have these important conversations until after marriage.\n\nBottom line: NTA in my opinion, but do try and come to some kind of understanding", "It's your house, if you don't want him on the deed I completely understand. Nor should you feel forced into doing so.\n\n\n> I won\u2019t ever give it to anyone.

Dear husband, if I die I'd rather give to someone else rather than you.\n\nEdit: I see in your other comment that OPs husband comes from generational wealth as to where OP doesn't.
