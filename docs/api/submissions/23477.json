No one has the right to forbid you from doing anything, ever, for any reason.\n\nSecond of all, without trust, there is no relationship.

It is disgusting to just stick your fingers in someone else's dinner and expect them to eat it.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing taking his plate of the exact same food. It's very telling that he expected you to eat something he'd stuck his dirty hand in, but refused to eat it himself.\n\nHe is weaponising his blindness as an excuse to abuse and control you. Being blind doesn't mean he can't be an asshole - and he is absolutely being an asshole. You can eat whatever you want, whenever you want.

Get your hands out of my fucking food, dude.\n\nAnd his friend's idea of support is ridiculous, \"financially controlling\"? If all you did was point out you paid for the meal, that is some drama queen shit. If you do pay for lots of things and you were pointing that out, that shows he is leaching off you, it doesn't show you controlling him. All the controlling comes from the other side, the boot is on the other foot. You find yourself eating food you don't like, just to keep him from bitching at you? This is immensely sad.\n\nAnd as for him getting handsy with your food, doing that once is too often; doing it *yet again* after promising he wouldn't do it any more is some massive fucking red flags. And calling you \"irrational\" for enforcing a boundary that he had already agreed he wouldn't cross is creepy behaviour of an unfortunate gendered kind. \"Oh you irrational, silly woman, I was just checking up on you\" Yikes, dude, big yikes. You want someone in your life you can control like that, get a dog.\n\nIt's a shame your parents have such low expectations for you that they think you should be a martyr to this control freak, but you don't have to put up with this shit.

If anything he robbed you of your dinner by touching it. He\u2019s trying to assert dominance over you in public, this is why he doesn\u2019t do it at home.

I mean, it's the same thing anyway - why does it matter? \n\nI don't think you handled this inappropriately in any matter. Your fiance disrespected your boundaries, tried to downplay your feelings towards the matter, involved his friend who then went on to say you were ABUSING him, and refused to see that any of his actions were innapropriate. \n\nThis isn't a 'love spat'.

I don't care what your disability is you have no right to tell someone they have to order the same thing as you when you go out to dinner.  I understand not ordering something if there is a severe allergy because you just don't want to risk having that at the same table but that should be the only control someone has over what you order for yourself (especially if you are paying, if they are paying I could see seeing a price limit being within their right).  This is controlling.  What else does he do that's controlling?  Does he and everyone else let his controlling behavior slide because of his disability?  Time to put your foot down...

You're not the same person as him, you're completely separate entity. You can order whatever the fuck you want in a restaurant. This feels like very controlling behavior \"Order what I want\". And I'm afraid that could evolve into \"Do what I want\" as the relationship goes on. I think he sees you as an extension of himself and can tell you what to do.

It's just not socially done It's not acceptable and he needs to grow up. And again it feels like controlling behavior \"I want to make sure you're doing what I told you so I'm going to touch your food\" or worse yet \"I want to make sure because I don't trust you\" His behavior has hallmarks of manipulation and control, distrust, possessiveness, (as weird it is to be associated with food) and oddly enough jealousy also related to food.\n\nThere are many red flags here.

It shouldn't need saying but being able to eat the food you want and not have to eat the same thing is perfectly normal and ok. \n\nIt is completely unreasonable for him to expect you to always order what he wants to eat.
