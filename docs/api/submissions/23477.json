It is disgusting to just stick your fingers in someone else's dinner and expect them to eat it.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing taking his plate of the exact same food. It's very telling that he expected you to eat something he'd stuck his dirty hand in, but refused to eat it himself.\n\nHe is weaponising his blindness as an excuse to abuse and control you. Being blind doesn't mean he can't be an asshole - and he is absolutely being an asshole. You can eat whatever you want, whenever you want.

Get your hands out of my fucking food, dude.\n\nAnd his friend's idea of support is ridiculous, \"financially controlling\"? If all you did was point out you paid for the meal, that is some drama queen shit. If you do pay for lots of things and you were pointing that out, that shows he is leaching off you, it doesn't show you controlling him. All the controlling comes from the other side, the boot is on the other foot. You find yourself eating food you don't like, just to keep him from bitching at you? This is immensely sad.\n\nAnd as for him getting handsy with your food, doing that once is too often; doing it *yet again* after promising he wouldn't do it any more is some massive fucking red flags. And calling you \"irrational\" for enforcing a boundary that he had already agreed he wouldn't cross is creepy behaviour of an unfortunate gendered kind. \"Oh you irrational, silly woman, I was just checking up on you\" Yikes, dude, big yikes. You want someone in your life you can control like that, get a dog.\n\nIt's a shame your parents have such low expectations for you that they think you should be a martyr to this control freak, but you don't have to put up with this shit.

This behavior is weird and controlling. NTA.", "This is super weird and controlling. I\u2019d be worried that this is just the tip of an iceberg. He thinks you don\u2019t trust him because you want to eat what sounds good to you?  That\u2019s the whole reason you eat out. 1 you don\u2019t have to cook or clean 2 everyone gets what they want. \n\nThat he feels like he should choose the food you eat is a massive \ud83d\udea9.  That he would put his hands in your food to make sure you are eating what he wants you to eat is \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9.  That he verified he has the same food but is mad you switched plates is \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. That his friends agree with this unhinged behavior is \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. \n\nI bet his friends don\u2019t know the whole story. Or they are just as weird as he is.", "NTA, but does he think the waiter is in on it, too? Does he think you secretly write a note saying you don't actually want what you ordered? He hears you order the same thing. This is the weirdest hangup.", "The food touching is the least of your worries. Him controlling you will NOT get any better if you marry him.", "NTA. WTF, why the hell would you not be able to have something different?", "OH GOD NTA your fiance is an AH for sure", "NTA, why does he think you ordering something else is you treating him as \u201cless than\u201d? It just makes no sense to me", "NTA\n\nOk look his behavior is unacceptable on so very many levels. Why can't you just get what you want? How on earth does he think you're getting something else? He's not deaf too is he? Why doesn't he trust you?\n\nHoney you are living in a sea of red flags. I don't care that your fiance is blind - he is controlling, immature, and frankly ridiculous. You can do better.", "NTA. This policing what you eat is controlling and ridiculous. It's not a regular \"love spat\".", "NTA. I have dated a blind person for a long time and this is not normal. We just ordered what we wanted when we would go out. This guy is being controlling and weird", "You marrying Dennis Reynolds? You\u2019re an adult and can eat whatever you want and without someone prodding their fingers into your food. It\u2019s frankly insane that he expects this, thinks it\u2019s normal, and behaves like a petulant child when you wanted to switch plates to the one he didn\u2019t rummage through.", "He won\u2019t let you order something different from what he orders? \n\nGirl\u2026.are you really so desperate? Is the bar REALLY this low? \n\nBeing single is better than this. \n\nPlease leave this manipulative weirdo \n\nIt\u2019s only gonna get worse", "Sorry but it\u2019s really weird that you guys HAVE to order the same food. That\u2019s some weird type of food insecurity on his part. You should be able to eat whatever you want and not have his hands all over it \u2026!? NTA and consider having a serious talk about this because that\u2019s not normal", "NTA. Leave him. Just be quiet when you go and he'll never even notice....", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 needs therapy. He is controlling you to make himself feel better. You should never have agreed to his rule in the first place.", "NTA \nHe is not entitled to dictate what food you can eat just cuz he's blind or your fiance.", "What the actual? I can't even comprehend staying with someone who facts this way. So totally NTA. I can't even get past the idea that ordering something different than him is negative? HOW? My husband and I often intentionally order different things so we can both share and have more variety.", "NTA. Your ex-fianc\u00e9 is weird", "NTA. He\u2019s controlling and doesn\u2019t trust you. Plus who cares if you eat something different. You aren\u2019t eating what you want to keep the peace. Do you really want to spend your life keeping the peace and never enjoying yourself? I\u2019m absolutely astounded that your parents think you should go along with it- they are part of the problem here.", "NTA - He has issues and needs help. Expecting you to eat what he does and sticking his hand in your food. Nope. Bye.", "ESH. You both sound too immature to get married.", "NTA, but I think you need to really rethink a lot about this relationship. For starters, who the fuck does he think he is to 'check' that you're eating the same thing as him? Secondly, so what if you get something different than him. How the hell is 'my tastes are different than yours and I want chicken vindaloo and not fish and chips' treating him 'less than'? That makes no sense. It's bordering on if not crossing into gaslighting, since he's changing the narrative and making a thing something it's not. Screw that. Aside from that, he's being really controlling and demanding for someone that isn't paying for diddly.\n\nKind of feels like he's abusing his visual impairment and making anything that doesn't go his way as some kind of ableism and abuse. Please rethink this. If you can take a break from talking to him for a week and feel like a weight has been lifted and that you're feeling a bit of anxiety over having to talk to him again, then I think that tells you all you need to know. He's being controlling and abusive.", "That's disgusting and way out of line. So if you stay together you will never be allowed to chose your own meal? That's so not ok. And I repeat! It's disgusting.", "NTA - and first things first, why do you have to order same food as him? this is already a red flag control issue. Now he doesn\u2019t trust you and is touching your food..it\u2019s escalating. You need to ask yourself if you can live like this for the rest of your life..and why. Shoot, if you have kids, do the kids ALSO have to eat the same food? Or will they get to eat different and then you can nibble off their plate? See how ridiculous this life is\u2026it\u2019s too much.", "NTA\n\nThis is absolutely nothing to do with who touched who's food. But it's everything to do with the fact you're with a man so controlling of you that he dictates what you eat!!\n\nThis is a massive red flag... Does he control other areas of your life as well like this?", "NTA. Do not marry this guy. Controlling what you can or can't eat is a big no-no and will only increase over time. Next it will be what you can wear then what you can do. \nGet out of this relationship.", "INFO: has he ever been evaluated for OCD?", "This can't be real. Who gets to pick the acceptable meal? Let me guess...\n\n\nPlease leave this control freak.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBut please, be careful, this is not normal. This is so very controlling - what else will HE feel he is entitled to control?\n\nWill you have to wear the same clothes as him, eat all your meals the same as him? Will you not be 'allowed' to have friends of your own because he throws a fit? \n\nTRUST is the basis of any relationship. It's not even that he wants a taste of what you got, he is flat out telling you that he doesn't trust you and he doesn't respect you either. This is really worrying.\n\nPS it's okay to break up with him. Protect yourself, and protect your mental wellbeing first and foremost. You aren't his therapist nor his nurse - if he wants to feel more secure, he sound see a therapist, not control you.", "Hard to believe this scenario involves adults", "NTA. That is wildly controlling and weird! You should be able to order what you want without him throwing a tantrum or defiling your food.", "NTA\n\nHe's waving red flags and you're too blinded by his blindness to see them.\n\nHim being blind does not excuse him being controlling.", "NTA. It\u2019s not abuse to want your SO to *not put their damn hands on your food*", "NTA but I\u2019m not even going to comment on the touching of food, wtf is up with having to eat the same meal? That is psychotic behaviour that needs checking\u2026", "Holy crap on a cracker. \nWhat did I just read?\nNTA. But come on????\nFirstly, making you eat the same thing as him is unbelievably controlling and you were very foolish to go along with it as well as ridiculously naive to not see that.  \nSecondly, He\u2019s blind, not deaf. He can hear what you order when you give your order to the wait staff!!! \nHe does not in any way shape or form need to touch your food \u2018to check\u2019. \nThe fact that he was visibly uncomfortable before \u2018he checked\u2019 shows that he some deep seated psychological issues that he needs to address before committing to a relationship with anyone. \nRun. \nEdit. Posted before I\u2019d finished", "Dump him. What an abusive, controlling asshole. Get out now!   \n\n\nNTA, duh.", "This story sounds made up.\n\nHe's blind, not deaf. He heard you order. And if you did order the same thing and it was then proven that you ordered the same thing why would he care about having the plate he touched instead of the one he hadn't?\n\nIf this is real something weird is going on here that is not at all what you're saying it is. That may be because he never told you. But something weird is going on.\n\nWhat's the abbreviation for I don't believe the story and if it's real this is bizarre?", "NTA and I\u2019m hoping your update includes details about how you dumped his controlling ass. Blind or sighted, his behaviour is fraught with red flags. Move on.", "One million percent this. Award!", "Exactly also since they are at a restaurant he most likely heard her ordering and also you can see that they are the same so touching it to \"be sure\" is unnecessary. It seems like a power play to me.", "No, she needs to ditch him and see a therapist to find out why she accepted this treatment from someone in the first place.", "You're not at all bothered by the insanely controlling way in which this bloke treats his (hopefully soon to be ex) fianc\u00e9e, no?", "I don\u2019t understand why she has to eat the same thing as him. Who gets to choose the meal? Something tells me it\u2019s not OP", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "One of the rare times when I genuinely feel glad that someone has to live with a disability. He sounds like exactly the kind of guy who deserves it.", "I agree with all of this, I would also add his enlisting his friend on his side. His friend's idea of support is ridiculous. \"Financially controlling him\" because she points out she paid for the meal? What a drama queen. \n\nI think this relationship sounds like it has run its course, there is a fundamental lack of respect and denial of autonomy, and it's all coming from her bf", "Yeah what about kids? If they have kids are they going to be allowed to eat different food? \n\nNTA OP needs to run!", "\ud83d\udc46THIS!!!!!!!", "No, but he's known for having trust issues due to former relationships.", "Idk what his issue is! But he said something about \"equality\" which...I guess is nonsense to me because I don't get this argument.", "And the demand that she \"be rational\" - after he irrationally stuck his hand in her meal.  I think the rational course of action would be the one taken by the OP - \"you wanted to touch a meal, you can eat it - and I will take the meal that you did not touch\", sounds completely rational.  Instead he gaslights her ... \"My actions were completely normal, you're acting emotional\".", "His trust issues with his former partners is not something he gets to punish you for.", "Then he should work those out before inflicting this behavior on a new partner.", "Oh god i had a boyfriend like that once. His previous girlfriend cheated on him. So he didn\u2019t trust me and was controlling and got angry for stupid things. I made it very clear to him that i was not his ex and not to put his issues on me. \nHe promised to do better, he didn\u2019t. I ended it.\n\nHis trust issues do to previous relationships is not your responsibility.", "Maybe some abuse issues as well.  Holy moly.", "Are there foods that he is unable to eat?\n\nHave you ever tried just telling him that you are going to eat X and he can eat that or choose to eat something else?", "Because it's stupid / not existing. If he wants to eat what you eat, then he should order what YOU eat. Why do you order what he wants? That's some weird powerplay on his part.", "You should be able to eat any damn thing you want from a menu.  Wtf??  That is just bizarre and controlling.  And I assume he HEARD you order the same meal, so why TF does he need to check???  YWBTA if you cave to this weird ass behavior, because you\u2019re placating a child.", "That's because it makes no sense. There is no need for equality in meals when eating out, that's why folks eat out. Heck, if my family goes to a food court in the mall, chances are we're going to three different places and meet up in the middle with three different styles of food. We like what we like.\n\nThis is controlling behavior. Also, I get that blind folks use their hands to \"see\", but always with consent.", "Yeah its completely nonsense and is being used to guitl trip you and control you. That's not healthy at all.", "If his excuse for throwing a fit if both of you don\u2019t eat the same thing \u2014 which is insane \u2014 is \u201cequality\u201d, then why doesn\u2019t he eat the same meal *you* want half the time?", "Equality is you both having the right to eat what you want. I don\u2019t know what this is. And do you ever get to choose what you both eat? If not, that\u2019s not equally either."]}
