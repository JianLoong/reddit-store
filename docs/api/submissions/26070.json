This is a new flair we will be applying to posts with a high volume of rule violating comments that will restrict participation to only trusted community members. This will also apply to all posts more than a week old.\n\n# Why is this necessary?\n\nSome posts attract a disproportionate volume of rule breaking comments, and it doesn\u2019t feel fair to all of the other posters to spend so much of our effort moderating that single post. We\u2019ve tried pinning reminders of the rules in these posts, but many inevitably lead to a lock which is a poor experience for everyone having a conversation within that post. We\u2019re taking a note from other communities who have faced similar challenges to still allow activity in these posts without blowing up the queue. We'll send a message to anyone who has their comment removed for this reason explaining why, and inviting them to sort by /new to find hundreds of other posts made today they can participate in.\n\n# What are \u201ctrusted community members\u201d?\n\n[Good question!](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/fd8c35d0-a8b4-4e36-b4df-d1e2ab604f96) Right now we\u2019re exploring subreddit specific karma and another mod tool to find the right balance. We expect we\u2019ll be spending some time testing these variables, and welcome your feedback below as we do. \n\n## As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n\\---\n\n[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)", "created_utc": 1693684358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023/", "score": 14, "replies": ["I\u2019ve seen other subs use positive karma as an indication of who is \u201cpart of the community\u201d and I imagine that has to be tough here.
