Not only was that person teasing OP about what they ate, but maybe if the friend was less of an a hole about it OP would\u2019ve been happier to share. You\u2019re calling it a silly argument but you\u2019re missing the part where OP felt disrespected by them and then they ask for something of OPs that they had no right to try and lay claim to.

The world doesn't work like that. You are not obligated to share with ANYONE. They were not being petty and cheap. They just didn't want to share. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. You need to reflect on your attitude on calling people names when they don't share. It's not cool and shows what kind of person you are. Do better.", "Did you?", "Wow.  That's a lot of wrong for just one post.  While you aren't obligated to share with anyone, these are friends you're going out to eat with.  You're telling me you wouldn't let your friends try your pizza?   I guess that shows what kind of friend you are, or what kind of friends you have.

OP just didn't want to share their food, this ONE TIME. Why that is hard for you to understand, I don't know. Sharing is NOT mandatory.

I can't relate to treating my friends like that, but do you mate.", "Not wanting to share pizza makes someone a tool? \n\nOkay champ. It\u2019s very obvious that OP\u2019s friends are passive aggressive and do this often, considering OP said they made fun of her \u201cas usual\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your reading comprehension skills are so poor that you think any of this is normal. Or maybe you\u2019re just like them, who knows? I\u2019m muting you regardless, I don\u2019t really care either way.", "Congratulations?"]}
