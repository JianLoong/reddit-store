I have a morning meeting at 9:30 every day and our 4 yo takes a while to get ready and get to school so there's been plenty of days where I'm on my meeting with the video off muted and minding our 1yo for 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nThis morning, I asked her at 9:10 to mind our 1 yo so I could start work. She was a bit upset that I was changing our usual schedule. I pointed out that it made sense given that she now has more flexibility.\n\nThis went back and forth for a while, to me it seemed pretty obvious that the person who doesn't have any work commitments can take the 20 minute hit in the morning. She'll still be in the office from 10 to 4:30 / 5. She's always imo felt a need to act like she's the busier of the two of us which is fine if it's a typical workday.

You're not contributing financially anymore, which makes you feel inferior. You saying \"you're less busy\" is the same as saying \"you're less of a success\" to her.\n\nIt's not wrong of you in general to ask her to pick up the slack when parenting.

Calm tf down.", "I never said you couldn't, I'm just wondering what the point was, seeing as you're so incredibly biased in your comments.", "I agree he's TA for how he asked, but I don't think he's TA for asking at all like a lot of people are saying. So then it comes down to what you're judging him on. \n\nYeah, his responses make him seem like more of TA than his original post. Very dismissive and argumentative."]}
