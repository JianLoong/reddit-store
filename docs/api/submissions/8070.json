I had this for a long time in my marriage.  Like maybe she thinks you can easily do it because you always have and your job isn't a big deal. I mean you always do it, right? \n\n3 Maybe she wants her own workspace?  My husband has turned out office into his lair.  It's all his.  So I turn the full bed in the guest room sideways against the wall and setup a desk for me in there. \n\nAnyway, I think communication is the key.  Sit down and talk. Ask her why you had the fight this morning.  What made her angry exactly?  Explain that you didn't think it was a big deal and you know it's only temporary.  Perhaps she was worried about being late. Perhaps she felt insulted.  Perhaps she doesn't like taking care of the kid.  Perhaps shes resentful that you get to stay home all the time and she's only (hopefully) getting this short time and she can't even enjoy it.  \n\nYou don't have any idea what she's feeling until you ask.", "Yes YTA. \nShe finishes work in two weeks. She isn't unemployed till then.\nShe maybe could have shifted her schedule around if you'd bothered to ask, but you didn't.\n\nThen you post a bunch of stuff about her needing to act like the busier of you two like you hadn't just ignored her having to work her notice, in her office where it's always been mandatory to go in, even if she might have a bit more flexibility in these last two weeks that you could totally manage to deal with just like you've always managed before. \n\nYour sympathy and compassion for her sudden job loss less than a week ago is mind-blowing.", "soft YTA. If you had asked the night before I would say NAH but because you waited until less than hour before she had to be in the office she was likely already in the middle of her routine to get to work. She may not have had time to drop what she was doing and take care of the one year old.", "Your reasoning is not wrong, but your communication is lacking. Without having a conversation with your wife in advance of your request, you have no idea what her considerations are, nor does she know what you are thinking or why. \n\nYou can\u2019t just take for granted that a shared routine means everyone understands everyone else\u2019s point of view - communication is still required.\n\nPlease also remember that when you make a request of someone else, expecting that they will automatically see that your intentions and you plans are correct and best, then that request feels like a demand. Without even intending to, you can set someone who would otherwise be inclined to agree with you on the defensive, just by assuming that your own thought process is right, and that they\u2019ll see the same this you do without any further explanation.\n\nNAH", "You've been WFH long enough to forget how even departing 5 minutes later can extend the drive time by 20 minutes. Additionally  you did not communicate in advance of the morning that you want your spouse to tend the 1 year old before she goes to work then got upset for unmet expectations. YTA", "I think the key here is \"expecting.\" You went into the discussion as if the decision had already been made and are upset that she didn't immediately go along with it. It doesn't sound like you discussed this at all prior to springing it on her in the moment.\n\nSo if it was purely about wanting to renegotiate sharing of responsibilities based on her new availability, that would be fine.\n\nBut instead you just assumed that you could reassign her time for her instead of discussing it like partners and equals.\n\nSo for that part, YTA. It's not so much the what, but the how.", "NTA - That's a totally reasonable request in that context. She's probably just extra sensitive from losing her job and overreacting. Try to cut her some slack, but you're absolutely N T A.", "NAH. It's sensible to ask your spouse to look after the little one if you have literal paid work you're doing. Asking you to juggle the two is a pretty big imposition so if it can be avoided, I would feel like it should be. Your wife is probably sore about losing her job, which is probably making her react poorly to unplanned changes to her schedule. That's completely understandable, so talking in advance about things like this, rather than springing them on her at the time would be wise.", "NTA, not to sound like a broken record  but as some have alrdy said similar things,you didn't ask her to not go to work, or do what she needs to do for the whole day. You certainly didn't say that that's how it's goin to be from now on or permanently.So basicly this comes down to her making a big deal over you asking to watch the kid for what like 20 or 30 mins or w.e it was if anything she's TAH.And for those saying \"oh she just lost her job or w.e\" yea she lost her job ,she ddnt just find out her parents passed away or somthing, dosnt excuse you from watching your own kid for litrly 30 mins and espcially starting a whole argument over it.", "NTA. It's pretty self explanatory, she is at home and it shouldn't be a hardship to look after her own child for 20 minutes.\n\nAlso some of the people saying it should be discussed before hand, get over yourselves, she is there and he needs to work what needs to be discussed?", "I see your point of view, but some companies use tardiness or absenteeism to deny a severance package. She may not have work duties but it doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t being required to sit at her desk for two weeks in case something does come up in the transition. 20 minutes late with the wrong boss could cost an entire severance package. And it\u2019s not really fair for OP to ask his wife to be 20 min late to work as she\u2019s walking out the door.  I tried to INFO OP to ask about it but I haven\u2019t gotten a response. I noticed that other INFOs posted at a similar time as mine were responded to. That\u2019s pretty telling to me. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards ESH because of that to be honest. She could have offered but he should have asked at some point before this morning since it\u2019s a change from their usual routine and she isn\u2019t exactly unemployed yet.\n\nEditing because OP responded: Severance isn\u2019t tied to completing the notice period. I stand by ESH, communication is a two way street that neither of them chose to go down.", "I think the issue is more about the fact that OP asked their wife at 9:10AM when they had a meeting in 20 minutes, rather than at some point over the last several days when they could've found a moment to discuss changes in family responsibilities/morning schedules now that the wife won't be working for a bit.\n\nSomething as simple as \"hey, I know you likely have some responsibilities at work as you wind down over the next few weeks, but would it be possible for you to cover the kids in the morning so  I can participate more in my 9:30 meeting?\"", "But he didn't ask her until the absolute very last second. He just assumed she would do it and that she has unlimited free time.", "She has severance, it's not tied to showing up in the office", "Agree. If she is \"still technically working,\" they likely still expect her to show up as she had done previously. And while she probably doesn't have new tasks, in my experience, they will be expecting that she wrap up and transition existing things. Finally, even if her severance isn't technically tied to her physically being there, this isn't the time to burn bridges or look like she has her feet up on her desk. She's probably going to need a reference at least.", "Dumping baby care? He is working and asking his spouse to watch THEIR child for twenty minutes.", "Also consider she might have to still show up to get references etc and her things in order - copies of payslips, not leaving coworkers in the lurch and saying goodbye to people she\u2019s worked with and won\u2019t see again. Also just the adjustment, she\u2019s just lost her job, that can\u2019t be nice and might not have sunk in yet.\n\nHave the conversation about her changed schedules and the changed child care - it does make perfect sense, but emotionally it came across as a little cold when she\u2019s going through a rough time. Plus the schedule will be even more different in 2 weeks when she actually has no job as opposed to still being employed but going out the door.", "Also sounds like this and an hour from 430 to 530 are the only times he \"minds\" the baby.", "Agree. She's been NOTIFIED that she is being laid off but OP even says she is still technically working. I wonder if there really isn't anything for her to do or if that's just OP's read of the situation. I would assume she probably isn't doing anything new, but that they expect her to wrap up and transition any existing projects she was working on. She still needs to show up well. She may need a reference from one of these people; she can't afford to look like a slacker now.", "OP said she's not even expected or required to come in though, so I don't think she has to worry about burning bridges. The company is just giving them 2 more weeks on the payroll.", "Our nanny leaves at 4:30. I mind the 1yo until my wife gets back around 5:30. She picks up the 4yo. We then split parenting, cooking, washing up etc for the rest of the evening. Neither kid wakes up at night.\n\nI find the comments about me only watching the baby for an hour and a half hilarious and incredibly anti dad. Would someone every have come to that conclusion for a mom? It's pretty clear I was taking about solo parenting time. Did people think I just head out the door to the bar or something at 5:30?", "I get the feeling that OP has been waiting to throw the \u201cbusier than thou\u201d argument at his wife for some time. Come 9:00 am on the first morning he was ready.", "Her predicament doesnt mean she can be less of a parent while the one with actual work responsibilities picks up the slack", "Not fair! You have had a snapshot of their living situation. You can\u2019t judge her parenting solely on OP\u2019s read of the situation", "OP clearly states in the post that she was going to work at 10. So she was already planning on going in later and doing a modified schedule with less hours.", "Then ESH. She could have offered to help, and you should have asked her well in advance if you wanted/needed the help.", "Almost none of this first paragraph matters because she isn't going to work until 10am the next two weeks. So she's at home and not caring for the kid. While OP is at work And caring for the kid. That's not fair. \n\nCould they have brought it up beforehand? Yes. I also can understand a slip in assumptions. I don't think 20 minutes of taking care of your own child should be considered cold or rough when losing a job. If losing a job is That detrimental to your mental health that you can't parent for less than half an hour, that's a reason to sort out in therapy. Grumpy at a sudden change you didn't think of? Okay. But the problem shouldn't go past a \"hey, I was really caught off guard this morning. I wish we talked about that last night. I can do it from now on since that makes sense. Let's try and plan any changes together in advance next time\".\nAlso, why can't the nanny just take the 1 year old on the trip to drop off the older kid when OP is in meetings in the first place?

I think this is the issue, it was an expectation you created and failed to communicate to her.

I know you said she's not as busy now, but you mentioned she did have plans to set up presentations so it's not like she wasn't busy.\n\nWhat's obvious to you may not be obvious to her, I think your expectation was reasonable but since she's technically still working and going to the office for two weeks it may not have occurred to her (and that would be reasonable as well), vs if she had completed her two weeks and was now at home all day.", "But it sounds like she's supposed to be at the office riding out her last days?

I think it's a case of ESH, and that your take is an overreaction.", "No, he said\n\n\"She'll still be in the office from 10 to 4:30 / 5.\"\n\nNot that SHE said she'd be in at 10.", "She is already treating what's left of her job as no job.\n\nShe isn't going in every day as she would normally have to.\n\nHer only plan for the \"work\" day is to look for another job using the companies resources - which would be outright forbidden under any sort of normal company time.", "My mother said this to me once. I was in high school so I wrote out assume and broke it down to see if she was right. She was. I haven\u2019t ever forgotten it and I use it from time to time when commenting on something.", "OP\u2019s sketchy self-centered post is surely from his POV, we don\u2019t know if he actually knows what is required of wife.  However, we do know he\u2019s not great at communicating so he probably isn\u2019t a great listener either.", "You want to know what the \u201cproper\u201d word is?\n\nI\u2019ll happily clue you in.\n\n**PARENTING.**\n\nThat\u2019s the word.  You\u2019re not the babysitter, you\u2019re the damn PARENT.  \n\nGood grief.", "\"She is still technically working for the next 2 weeks but has no actual work stuff to do. She plans to go into the office for some of it just to prepare presentations for job hunting and to have a desk area to do that.\"\n\nThis is what OP said. Said nothing about still being expected to go into the office. She just WANTS to go in to use the computer", "She gets the sack and OP is the one upsetting her routine?\n\nPull the other one.", "It's self centred to expect the other parent to look after their own child for 20 minutes because you are in a meeting?", "You certainly have an appropriate username for your misandry...", "This is one of the biggest double standards, when my wife loses a job she needs 1-2 weeks to \"process it\", if papers were reversed i can bet you after 1-2 days she would be on top of me.\n\nSame applies here, if papers were reversed, people would be calling OP lazy for not helping the wife while unemployed.", "Accusing OP of lacking consideration and compassion is a bit dramatic given the circumstances. We're talking about 20 mins of child-minding, which by anybody's estimate is not very long. As you say, she's had 4 or 5 days to process what's happened. She has more flexibility than she usually does, so it seems logical to let OP be fully present for his meeting while she heads off to work a few minutes later. She was still home when she usually isn't, so is clearly ok with being flexible with her schedule.", "So that rather long word technically, means in that yes she\u2019s expected to be there if they have work for her. And like others pointed out, being late (depending on an asshole boss or not)or not showing up can lose a person their severance package. And OP said he agreed he should have communicated this before hand not at time of. Nobody here seems to believe that it\u2019s unreasonable, just unreasonable that he expected it without discussing it beforehand!", "My username is a Game of Thrones reference, I can\u2019t see how it would relate to this discussion at all, but way to side-step and distract from all the valid points I made instead of internalizing them.", "She\u2019s not currently unemployed, no office would let a terminated employee have access to the building, that\u2019s security 101.", "He also says the only reason she is going in to work is because she wants to use their desk for things that are definitely not her job lol.", "Looking for a job is a job.  It requires workspace which doesn\u2019t exist outside of OPs desk. Unless he has told her that she doesn\u2019t need to look for a job, she still has work to do.", "When he focused on the \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a job so she has free time\u201d instead of the \u201cshe lost her job so she needs to focus on finding a new one\u201d it\u2019s just so rude and goes against anything a supportive partner would do\n\nI wonder how Reddit would react if it\u2019s husband who lost the job instead. My bet is they\u2019d expect the wife to support the husband to find a new job rather than expecting him to prioritize childcare with his new free time. Find it hard to believe it\u2019s not a double standard then.", "So true. Good for you for sticking to your guns! It must be very difficult to stand against these \u2018secret\u2019 societal pressures. I say secret because everyone likes to pretend it isn\u2019t an issue and what I personally suspect to be the leading cause of divorce. If we\u2019re gonna be expected to do it all, why wouldn\u2019t we do it for our own damn selves then. \n\nIt\u2019s really unfair and I wish these things were talked about more. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t even understand these plights so I\u2019m trying to educate him and it\u2019s always \u201cwhere\u2019s the research\u201d and \u201ccorrelation isn\u2019t causation\u201d \ud83d\ude44 really hopeless", "Work that can easily wait 20 minutes. Work that by rights she shouldn't be doing during her exit period anyway.", "There is no research or sources for this kind of bias. No one cares to look into it. I can tell you it\u2019s real, but I can\u2019t \u201cprove it\u201d to anyone. It is what it is I guess.", "> How is it doing more if you just agreed he was watching the kid because he has more flexibility as a remote worker?\n\nIt doesn't matter why he was doing more. He was still doing it."]}
