Rent is the only thing I'm legally required to pay until the tennancy is expried, so I'm continuing to pay for that. I could have gotten out of it if my flatmate also agreed, however my ex flatmate doesn't want to leave the house which is why I'm stuck paying for a house I'm not living in. It's a fixed contract which means I'm legally required to stay untill the lease expires unless all flatmates/landlords agree to terminate. Which everyone but the flatmate agreed on, keeping me stuck. So to save money I disconnected the power since it was under my name (to avoid fucking with my credit score) and I stopped paying for the internet bill and other non rent expenses since I don't use it now that I'm not living there. Plus none of it is under my name so I'm not legally bound too apart from my room. However my flatmate is saying that is \"burdening them\" to pay for everything themselfs and has been calling me an ass for not continuing to pay for everything while I'm not physicly living there anymore. Plus they have called me an asshole for disconnecting the power despite them having the means to reconnect it under their own name. The house itself is old, damp and mouldy so without power to heat it, itll be pretty miserable to live in (Thou they have to power sorted so that should be fine).\n\nLike we used to be friends and they feel betrayed that I've decided to leave and stop paying for any utility's since now they're going broke paying for shit themselves. Theyre fully employed and knew about this in advance, yet this has somehow fucked them over? That and since all the furniture was mine, the house is basicly empty which probably aslo made them angry. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit -\n\n(I'm in the southern hemisphere, so laws and climate differ from the west)\n\nDid they have notice I was leaving? - yes 2 months\n\nWhy am i paying for still - my portion of the rent untill  the lease is terminated in Jan\n\nWhat about subletting? - it was allowed at first however as the house is being sold once our lease ends, our landlord now refuses that. Besides logisticly it makes no sense to live in a house for 4 months with no avalible renwall.\n\nDid they notice I was cutting the power? - yes 2 weeks when I did it / 1 months when I decided I'd remove my name by doing so. I mainly did it just because I didn't want mu name or credit score associated with it as it's only recently started to be conciderd good. \n\nWhat am I legally required to pay? - rent and that's it, other things aren't in my name. Rents the only thing I'm paying, untilties... No\n\nHow's the housing market? - it's volitile for students however as a full-time worker in a nice job they're fine.\n\nCould they have left stable if they agreed to terminate early? - unsure, they have stable income and tennacy refrences which as all you need, so it wouldn't be too hard for them. To terminate you get 28 days to leave before you're no longer legally living there, so there would be time.\n\nAm I financially stable? - kinda, I'm a student so I get part time work and student allowance. with that  wanted to terminate, but they were set on staying. Not to pissed about paying 2 rents however it's a pain. I'm decent at budgeting so it isn't to heavy on me. \n\nHave they sorted the power yet? - they'll likley have it back on by Tuesday under their name. \n\nDoes this affect my bond or anything? - depends on the state on the house. I intend on going back for a good deep clean but shouldnt be too bad if one person's in that house. \n\nIf the house is damp will that damage the room? - unlikely conciding it's mid spring with an average of 19 degree Celsius with summer coming to warm shit up more. Plus the avs system can't be turned off based of rooms so that'll keep the walls and ceiling fine. There's a kitchen leak making the main damp issues but that's to be sorted by a well aware landlord. \n\n\n\n(My ass dyslexic so sorry for poor Grammer and spelling)", "created_utc": 1667119311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh9bvd/aita_for_refusing_to_continue_to_pay_for_shit/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I assume you\u2019re not authorized by the landlord to try and set up a 60 day sublease and get somebody in there to pay rent and a portion of the rest until he original lease ends? As long as the legal verbiage of the lease is boilerplate, your flatmate should have no legal recourse against you in that instance. And I would think with so many people in dire straits.
