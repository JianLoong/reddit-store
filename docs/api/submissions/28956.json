{"id": 28956, "submission_id": "178c3mu", "title": "AITA for saying GF and dad acted wrongly and I'm considering a breakup?", "selftext": "I'll keep this to the point. I went out with my GF and her dad for her dad BDay. Was impromptu. I was told to be the DD and called an uber driver by her dad. At the first bar my GF started acting closed off and moody. She then said I was staring at some random dude her dad was talking to. She has expressed this anxiety before , but this made me uncomfortable due to the public setting. I am not attracted to men and have discussed it with her at length.Yet still she has now forced me to discuss and defend this to her family. I let it go. \n\nFast forward. We went to another bar. Right after we stopped at a burger place. I went inside to order with her dad then stepped outside to sit with my GF. A security guy walked out with her dad and said he was drunk and a woman said he touched her. \n\nFast forward. I drop them at her dad's house.I told them that it was about time we get going. Gf immediately said she wanted to sleep at her dad's house and wanted me to stay. I told her I just wanted to shower and sleep at our shared apartment as she has moved in with me. Her and her father insisted and I caved and reluctantly agree. The normal drunk conversation continued and at one point she brought up that we have discussed marriage. Her father took this opportunity to seemingly verbally attack me. He asked if I want to marry her why haven't I yet. I explained that I had some debts I wanted to get resolved and as I am changing careers and want to be more stable. He said that my stance was stupid and that nothing should stop love. I should marry his daughter or breakup with her. To my surprise she agreed with her father. Then he said if I'm worried about money I should have encouraged and required her to work. Again she agreed. This is upsetting becuase I have always encouraged her to pursue any opportunities, but I have never desired to force her into a job. He repeated himself this time saying that I don't love her enough and I need to cut her loose. This is coming from the man that my GF describes as verbally abusive to his ex and children. Not to mention he very likely just groped a woman at a restaurant, although I'm not certian. I told him we felt differently. He became aggressive and I decided that it was time to go. I asked my GF to come with me back home. She insisted on staying. I asked her multiple times to come with me. She refused and her father told me to leave. He slammed and locked the door on my way out.\n\nWe spoke today and she didn't remember what happened. Only that her dad and I argued. I told her what was said. How that made me feel. I also mentioned that she made me uncomfortable in publicly discussing her anxiety about how she thinks I might be down low, as well as that with her sister she kissed an ex she bumped into at a bar last week. I told her that if I had any respect I should breakup with her for myself, instead of breaking up as her father meant for this to benefit her. She said she feels terrible. AITA?
