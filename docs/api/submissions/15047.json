Almost as soon as we landed, they started arguing. I was sent outside, and when I came back in, my mom was acting...cagey. She told me one of my stepdad's cousins was getting married in two days, but not to worry about it. She kept saying that and was acting really strange, so I kept pushing until she explained. Yes, the cousin was getting married, but only symbolically. The cousin's family was desperate and needed a cultural wedding to happen for some reason. He'd already agreed to help out, so she couldn't really say no, but not to worry because it didn't mean anything because it was only symbolic, which is when I figured out *how* he was helping out.  \n\nShe reassured me that it didn't mean anything and begged me to just be polite. It was just going to be a fun party and a good opportunity to learn more about other cultures. That entire day is a blur, but the food was good. We went home fairly early. My mom and I spent the rest of the trip as just us while my stepdad was with his family, but once we got home, everything was completely normal and we never really talked about any of that again. Until today. \n\nMy stepdad called to ask if we (me, my wife, and daughter) would come for a vacation in his home country. He would pay for everything. He was really pushing for it, so I pushed back, and he confessed that along with family time, he also needed me to come along so they could undo the symbolic marriage so that the cousin could get married to her SO, because she currently can't because she's considered to be already married to me.\n\nI don't see a reason to. It wasn't a legal wedding in the first place, it literally couldn't have been for several reasons, so there shouldn't be anything to undo. He said he was sorry that this happened, but now we can just fix this and \"never think about it again\". I don't really want to go to his country, it's not really safe to go there in the first place, and I really don't like the idea of getting trapped somewhere again where I don't know the language or what's going on. \n\nHe's telling me that I'm selfish because while it obviously doesn't affect me, not fixing it does affect the cousin and \"isn't letting her move on\". My mom is pleading with me to go, that it's one day out of a vacation that my stepfather is willing to pay for because he \"feels so terrible\" about it. My wife doesn't think I should go because it's not safe and it's not something that should be my problem anyway. I've asked my father, and he's torn. Obviously I don't *have* to go but if it is that easy, maybe a free vacation isn't a bad idea and I'd be helping someone.
