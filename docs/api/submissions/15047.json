Almost as soon as we landed, they started arguing. I was sent outside, and when I came back in, my mom was acting...cagey. She told me one of my stepdad's cousins was getting married in two days, but not to worry about it. She kept saying that and was acting really strange, so I kept pushing until she explained. Yes, the cousin was getting married, but only symbolically. The cousin's family was desperate and needed a cultural wedding to happen for some reason. He'd already agreed to help out, so she couldn't really say no, but not to worry because it didn't mean anything because it was only symbolic, which is when I figured out *how* he was helping out.  \n\nShe reassured me that it didn't mean anything and begged me to just be polite. It was just going to be a fun party and a good opportunity to learn more about other cultures. That entire day is a blur, but the food was good. We went home fairly early. My mom and I spent the rest of the trip as just us while my stepdad was with his family, but once we got home, everything was completely normal and we never really talked about any of that again. Until today. \n\nMy stepdad called to ask if we (me, my wife, and daughter) would come for a vacation in his home country. He would pay for everything. He was really pushing for it, so I pushed back, and he confessed that along with family time, he also needed me to come along so they could undo the symbolic marriage so that the cousin could get married to her SO, because she currently can't because she's considered to be already married to me.\n\nI don't see a reason to. It wasn't a legal wedding in the first place, it literally couldn't have been for several reasons, so there shouldn't be anything to undo. He said he was sorry that this happened, but now we can just fix this and \"never think about it again\". I don't really want to go to his country, it's not really safe to go there in the first place, and I really don't like the idea of getting trapped somewhere again where I don't know the language or what's going on. \n\nHe's telling me that I'm selfish because while it obviously doesn't affect me, not fixing it does affect the cousin and \"isn't letting her move on\". My mom is pleading with me to go, that it's one day out of a vacation that my stepfather is willing to pay for because he \"feels so terrible\" about it. My wife doesn't think I should go because it's not safe and it's not something that should be my problem anyway. I've asked my father, and he's torn. Obviously I don't *have* to go but if it is that easy, maybe a free vacation isn't a bad idea and I'd be helping someone.

It sounds like the cousin has suffered enough for the sake of \"tradition.\"", "Would help to mention that and not refer to yourself as \"she\".", "WHAT!?!????\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine ever talking to my mother again after something like that. That act of utter betrayal is horrifying.", "Right.  The community might seize your passport, declare your wife a harlot, your daughter a bastard and sell them into prostitution.  This isn't a free vacation.  This is a trap.", "Them why would you even consider for one minute going and participating in this ridiculous deception? There are easier ways to go on vacation.", "And what are the communities thoughts on divorce? Are you even sure that's acceptable there?", "You make the most sense to me. Thanks.", "Absolutely this. Don't get yourself into these kind of things, the marriage might not be legal in the US or Europe, but there are so many loopholes. Many countries might consider this a legal marriage and with some false papers you might end up having married without your consent.\n\nDon't agree to take part in weird ceremonies, not even for money or a free holiday. And don't go back to that country. NTA, but I am worried about your safety. How old are you now and how old were you when you attended the ceremony?", "It wouldn't be recognized here or there from what I know for several reasons.", "I meant community. Typed out the word government too many times.", "I think that's harsh. Those who enforce the cousin's \"traditions\" that required this symbolic marriage are the true AHs here. Stepdad and mom are also AHs, but only to the extent they involved OP in this when he was too young to appreciate what was happening or consent. Everything suggests they did it, however, to save cousin from the unfair traditional ramifications for whatever happened (pregnancy, bad arranged marriage looming, etc.) that resulted in her needing a symbolic marriage. And OP admits that, until now, it has never really affected his life.  Why jump to \"go no contact\" with family that is only in this mess by virtue of trying to help out family?", "This was my thought.  If he was willing to force you into a \"symbolic marriage\" as a child what is to keep him from doing the same thing to your daughter?", "Or confiscate your passport so you can not return home.", "Okay! I\u2019m not crazy either cause I\u2019m suspecting option #2 as a strong possibility \ud83d\ude05", "I don't?", "From what they've said, it would be annulled/dissolved. Not really a divorce.", "Are you willing to risk your marriage and your independence on what you think that you know?  Devious people have devious ways.  There are far to many unknowns.", "Where is here\u2026the US?", "Because they are trying to do it to him ***again***.  Something is very wrong.  He needs to put up a barrier until all sorts out.  Give it a year.", "They lied to him once, both step dad and his bio mother. Both of whom should have put their kid first. Were I in that situation, me and my kid would have been out of that country within the day and divorce papers would be waiting for the step-dad.\n\nNeither or trustworthy. They violated him as a child.", "Look, I'm saying this as half Indian. Some of the tradition fanatics are crazy.", "well, you already know they are happy to lie to you and your mother is more than happy to ignore your well-being when your step father demands so I wouldn't believe a word they said. If it's so non-legal and not recognized, then why do you even need to be there? Its' because you are going to be expected to make them whole in some way or another. Don't go and I'd consider going NC with your parents. They don't seem to have your best interests at heart.", "I agree he is NTA for refusing to partake in the undoing of something he never agreed to in the first place. I just think there is a way to say \"No thank you\" without going no contact. It's not like this is a surprise or new development--OP has known about it since the initial \"wedding.\"", "not only NC, I would be looking at legal action against them... still cannot wrap my head around what is happening here and why on earth did OP's mother go along with that", "Maybe, but my read is that stepdad is a rat, mom is too scared to stand up to him, stepdad's loyalty is entirely to his family and OP is expendable.  They are still giving him evasive answers.  They know that if they give real answers the OP will stay far away.  OP needs to understand that he is just a piece of meat to these rats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should elaborate.  Stepdad is slick.  If OP stays in contact, he will get sucked in."]}
