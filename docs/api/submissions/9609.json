Isn\u2019t a marriage 50/50? So loans would be paid by household? So she wants to leave you in a load of debt to pay off while she spends and does as she pleases. I\u2019m assuming you won\u2019t be combining your incomes in the future, which is fine, but you can\u2019t go into a marriage with a pile of debt and still cover your living expenses. \nUsually when parents give money for the wedding it\u2019s for the wedding not the individual. \nRun far and fast", "For sure. If someone is giving you that much it seems rather shortsighted to be getting into debt on top of it, for one day in your life.

Anything left over is then kept until next payday and then transferred into savings if it doesn\u2019t get touched.\n\nFinancially she\u2019s very clever, I am not. \nI have one account and a credit union for savings and worked out my in and out with excel.

I think it\u2019s a fools errand to expect people to completely change. If you marry her it will be even harder to leave. \n\nIt may be really tough to leave in regards to finances, but start looking for rooms for rent and budgeting.
