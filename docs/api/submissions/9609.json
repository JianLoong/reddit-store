I\u2019ve read some of your replies and can only comment on what I\u2019ve seen. Obviously I don\u2019t know the dynamic of the relationship nor is she here to provide her perspective. \n\nIf I was her I would be turned off also lol. You want to feel taken care of in the relationship as a women, and it seems that you\u2019re in her house that she bought herself? How much of your lives do you try to split down the middle? I would think it is \u201cpathetic\u201d as well to have a man depend on me financially. If you don\u2019t want to marry her because it\u2019s financially taxing I think you should tell her that and maybe save up and step up more as a man. I don\u2019t think either ita I just think there\u2019s some talking that needs to be done about what is expected and what you both need from each other so you don\u2019t have any resentment.", "Break up", ">\u201cYou need to man up and stop trying to make things 50/50 as it\u2019s pathetic and selfish\u201d\n\nSo I don't know about you stranger but this attitude would have convinced me I don't need a wedding loan at all. Know what I mean?\n\nNTA good luck in your future endeavors", "NTA\n\nMaybe you should have a bit of a think. Have there been many occasions of her using toxic masculine phrases to disparage you? How about any occasions where you had any kind of windfall or generally more coming in? \n\nher responce feels very much like one I have seen in a friends ex. \"My money is my money, your money is our money.\" \n\nMaybe put the wedding on hold? It could be she feels things are locked down enough for her to show her true colours.", "Yeah... im very lucky to have grown up with parents who invested in a plot of land and a little house instead of a wedding. Instead, they eloped and had a courthouse wedding. We were never privileged, it took my parents about 10 years of scrimping and saving to finish the house, but we never had to rent growing up. \n\nI dont understand taking a huge loan out for a wedding... not a sensible decision to make, especially since people often marry to start a family, which is pretty friggin expensive.", "A very fair point, thanks!", "A very fair point, it was made clear to me that it was a gift to us, as a couple, to pay off a portion of the wedding.\nWe would then go 50/50 on the remainder.\nThat was the original deal we made when the amount was 4k, now that the amount is 10k, why has the deal changed? I wasn\u2019t told this agreement had changed.", "She earns more than me, she has both parents who work (one of mine are deceased) and it is her that wants the large fancy wedding, something I have no interest in and frankly, want a small intimate affair.\nThe 10k gift would more than cover my ideal wedding, but she wants the large church, and reception for 80 or so, we don\u2019t even know 50 people so why do we need to book an entire ballroom?\n\nAlso please explain how the gift for our wedding from her father, is her contribution? Originally we planned to take the 4k and then go 50/50 on the remainder, so why has this changed and I must foot the bill alone for the remainder?", "I\u2019d absolutely agree, if that\u2019s her dads wishes, I would absolutely respect that as I\u2019ve said elsewhere, and what dad wouldn\u2019t want their daughter to have a debt free wedding?\nBut this was never disclosed or made clear, and the last sum was a joint gift. It\u2019s clear there\u2019s a lack of communication and assumptions have been made and need to be cleared up.", "Long story short, yeah it\u2019s messy and there\u2019s no winners here", "Scaling back the wedding has absolutely crossed my mind, and infact has been brought up previously in the comments you\u2019ve clearly read.\nThe wording and verbal abuse clearly doesn\u2019t cause you any issue and in fact you condone it, tell me how long have you been married and accepted verbal abuse from your partner?\n\nIt was told to us as a couple, that it was a gift to us as a couple, by her father originally, this new figure in my mind changes nothing about the original agreement unless it was specified otherwise.", "We both work, however she earns more than me and owns the house we\u2019re living in.\nI pay for half of all bills including mortgage.\nShe gets a VERY nice maternity package of a 1 year full pay I believe she said, and I believe we\u2019d keep our finances separate.", "The original amount of 4k was a wedding gift to the couple. \nThe new amount of 10k, I assumed would be held to the same agreement.\n\nI would be happy with a smaller wedding, as we barely know 50 people, never mind 80+, so why would we invite acquaintances that we barely know to eat and celebrate our wedding?", "Well we would both be taking out loans, but we would be sharing the cost between us, while we bank individually, we pay for things equally, ie dinner dates, house improvements etc.\nSo why would the wedding be different?\n\nThe only cost of the wedding I\u2019d expect no help with, is the engagement ring.", "Funnily enough, recently the UK got a \u00a3600 grant to every household for energy.\n\nWhile I pay half of the bills (including half of the monthly mortgage payments), recently this came in the post and she took it all and said how the gas is in her name, she has a credit card to pay off and she owns the house.\n\nI didn\u2019t see a penny, and she got a chunk paid off her credit card and a full tank of petrol.", "You do realise you are allowed to choose a nice person to marry, you aren't obligated to marry a total asshole?", "Take it from someone who\u2019s been divorced once, and almost twice. Both my marriages had huge red flags before we got married. \n\nThis is a sign of things to come and what your marriage will be like. It isn\u2019t even about the money. It\u2019s about her attitude and treatment of you.\n\nLeave now. Divorce is extremely expensive.", "She\u2019s dropping marinara flags everywhere.", "I wouldn't stay with a woman who insulted me like that, let alone repeatedly. Why do you?\n\nYou can find better, I guarantee it.", "Yeah you gotta boot my G. \n\nIt disgusts me hearing \u201cman up\u201d come out of ANYONES mouth. It\u2019s disgusting. You deserve better. Leave her ass goodluck", "She's right, man up and stop expecting everything to be 50/50. It's very unattractive.", "Maybe just get out of the relationship, it will be less costly to you in all ways. \n\nNTA", "whats the worst that can happen? - Dr Pepper", "If that isn\u2019t the biggest red flag I\u2019ve ever heard. DO NOT marry this woman, you will live to regret it.", "Sounds like you should talk to her dad, but yeah why are you still considering this relationship?", "Nope no winners. It honestly sounds like you are depending on her for everything and it\u2019s taking a toll on the relationship. She wants a man to take care of her or be considerate. She probably thought you would still contribute and you went oh we good. While living in her home. I think you guys need a conversation of what you want from each other. \n\n\nI personally don\u2019t believe in 50/50 that\u2019s roommates, but that can work for other people. I personally just don\u2019t see how it works when it comes to kids. Women give up so much more and their bodies time off careers and more.\nMy boyfriend and I have a understanding and he loves taking care of me. I work and own the place we stay in but he pays all bills and dates; I don\u2019t spend money with him except when I do boyfriend days where I treat him all day. We have talked about if we get married he would like to buy the home and I rent my spot out. We had adult conversations about the next step. \n\n\nI think y\u2019all need finanacial counseling, but I do understand where she\u2019s coming from. She probably thought this man can\u2019t even help with the wedding and lash out instead of discussing her feelings.\n\n\nI wish you luck, I hope it works out.", "Awesome mate \u263a\ufe0f", "The problem I have is that you think you should EACH take out separate loans to cover the difference.  Marriage doesn't work that way.  \n\n  \nIf you truly believe that marriage consists of separately splitting everything 50/50, then your relationship will slowly over time crumble into dust.  Should she be responsible for 50% of the mortgage, utilities and food while giving birth and raising children? \n\n  \nA better proposal would have been that you BOTH take out a SINGLE loan, TOGETHER as cosigners.  In any case, the gift from the father is NOT 50% for you, it's HIS contribution to make HIS daughter's wedding special for HER - regardless of who is the groom.  \n\n  If you don't like that, then thank him for the offer and refuse to accept the gift.   \nYou are the one holding the red flag.", "Thanks more info- is she having you sign any type of prenup? And is she going to put your name on the house once married since you are paying half the mortgage or keep it under only her name?", "Fair enough, so I can see why you assumed it may be a joint gift if finances are shared. However just a point - shared and joint aren't the same if you don't have joint savings.\n\nBut the issue is that you shouldn't assume. Normally if your wife gets a gift, it's hers. So why not check with her Dad and get confirmation. It's quite presumptuous to assume otherwise. Think of it like an inheritance - it would have been hers unless explicitly said otherwise. In my case, my parents said the money was for both of us, so we knew how to handle it.", "It\u2019s also incredibly unattractive to be selfish, rude and arrogant.\nIt\u2019s also unattractive to take other people for granted, to put your partner who earns less into debt on principle and to degrade your partner.\n\nHope you find someone who treats you the same.", "If it ever got to the marriage stage, I absolutely would be talking to the dad to work out how he wants the money spent as in the end it is his, so I\u2019d take his wishes into consideration of how it would it would be spent.\nIf he wanted to buy his daughter her dress and then the rest go into the wedding, cool, absolutely.\nIf he wanted to pay for the venue but nothing else and we had to fund the rest, absolutely.\nIf he wanted to fund the wedding on her behalf and I had to cover the rest, I would respect this as in the end he would still be helping out significantly", "She wants a prenup signed if we get married, and would only put me on the mortgage IF I matched her original deposit and gave it to her.", "This was actually a wedding gift previously 4k to help pay the wedding off for both of us, and we both understood this and would pay equally for the rest.\nThe amount may have changed, but I wasn\u2019t informed that the agreement changed, yes anything with money should always be confirmed and never assumed, and that\u2019s where this has come from.", ">wanted me to respect her more\n\nRespect is earned. She's done nothing to earn it. You already know it, but run, and run fast, and be cautious cos she might be the type to take some sort of vindictive revenge.", "She wants *you* to respect *her* more?  Yeah, she can lead by example, there.  Your comments in this thread alone show you already know what needs to be done.

I feel sorry for your SO.", "NTA. Sorry buddy but she kinda sucks. She makes more money than you but won\u2019t split the gift towards wedding cost so that you can equally Bear the burden. You are paying half the mortgage while getting no equity which is messed up because she is sucking more money out of you at that point. Also if she uses stuff like \u201cman up instead of making things 50/50\u201d guaranteed if roles were reversed and you made more money and had a house she would refuse to sign a prenup and if you ask Reddit atleast they would be mad at you wanting a prenup saying \u201ca prenup is supposed to protect both parties blah blah\u201d. So she is right it should not be 50/50 she should be paying a larger percentage of the bills both because she makes more money and  a large part of her mortgage is principal which you shouldn\u2019t be paying towards.", "My dad is unfortunately deceased and I was raised by a single mother who wasn\u2019t ready for life to suddenly take him away.\nShe has done an amazing job, but sadly he was the breadwinner and she was a stay home mum.\n\nMy family wouldn\u2019t have the same funds to put forward to the marriage, perhaps 1~3K but that would be max", "Well going off this thread, looks like YTA", "I assume you're in the UK, so that's not great advice.
