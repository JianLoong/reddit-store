Sounds like she is exhibiting the same controlling tendencies his ex was that caused you guys not to be around each other for 10 months. \n\nYou are NTA for going out with your friend. But you also might want to have a serious talk with the GF and what you are willing to accept and she is willing to accept going forward as acceptable behavior.  \n\nShe either trusts you or she doesn't. That is what it boils down to. And if she is saying you are disrespectful for going against what she says you can do that is a controlling flag to me.", "Daaaaaang.  is your GF related to his ex?\n\nNTA.  She's being ridiculous.", "Hell, my fianc\u00e9e gets a kick out of the drunken girlfriend stories I get wingmanning single friends. As long as no physical or emotional (much harder to do in drunken bar talk) lines are crossed, she has no issues with it.", "Unfortunately this probably has to do with OPs GFs past. If OP didn\u2019t cheat, my best guess is that their gf has had trust issues built from someone else in the past. As someone who had a partner like this it\u2019s a really hard balancing beam. On one perspective, I can see how much it could affect someone to get cheated on. But, for my case they never were able to learn to trust me even over a long period. So after 3 years of having her trust issues blamed on past people, sometimes it\u2019s time to move forward as she\u2019s not in a place relationally to trust.", "But as a \u201cwing man\u201d he will be talking to the woman of interest\u2019s friends.\n\nHe\u2019s NTA but he\u2019s lying saying he won\u2019t speak to other women.", "I'm not lying and no the likelihood is I won't be talking to other women.

What are you gonna do? Ignore her?\n\nIf a woman is platonically chatting with OP, there's nothing wrong with him talking to her as long as there's no intention to take it further. If a woman is flirting with him, he could easily tell her he already has a girlfriend and isn't interested.", "I think \"speaking\" is being used two different ways. In some contexts talking or speaking to a woman has a more focused meaning than just the simple act of exchanging verbal discussion. Speaking to women in the OPs context means talking with the specific intent to romance. So yes, the OP will be exchanging words with women, but not \"speaking\".", "I\u2019ve made platonic friends with women wingmaning a friend. As long as you\u2019re not crossing any physical lines or emotional boundaries (much harder during bar chat imo), then it\u2019s a non-issue. Half the time the friend of the person flirty is also in a relationship and not intending anything either.", "You can't even talk to a woman who isn't your GF when you're out? Does that include female bartenders and waiters? What about female uber drivers or female cashiers? Just trying to understand if you're allowed to talk to any women at all or if there are exceptions. Sounds like your friend might not be the only one in a controlling relationship. NTA but you will be if you stay with this kind of controlling, insecure person. Good luck!", "NTA. Sounds like your friend isn't the only one whose gf is controlling. Yours sounds obnoxious as well.", "NTA, your girlfriend is being immature and CONTROLLING! Red Flags.", "Stop telling people what they don't need to know for heaven's sake!  NTA...but you and BFF have a type.", "OP, it seems as though your GF has taken a page from your buddy's ex's book.  It didn't work for them, and it shouldn't work for you.  Either she trusts you or she doesn't.\n\nNTA", "OP should probably just not go to bars at all since women are likely to be there.  Actually include coffee shops, grocery stores,  gas stations, and libraries to that list just to be safe.", "Yeah because everyone knows that having a conversation with a woman is the same as fucking her. Grow up.", "So, the outside world in general?\n\n\ud83d\ude0f"]}
