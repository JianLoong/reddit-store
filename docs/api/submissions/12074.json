We have a 10 year old son together. Leanne works nights usually, and we had allowed my son to have a sleepover with a kid his age, we\u2019ve met his parents before and they\u2019ve had several play dates.  Last night he stayed at their house.\n\nAround 2 am I get woken up to my son texting me and says he\u2019s really bored and can\u2019t sleep and wants to be picked up. I asked him if he was feeling okay, if something happened,he said no. I had work at 6 am so I did not want to go out and drive 15 minutes to pick him up. I told him to tough it out and I\u2019d get up for work early and pick him up. About 10 minutes later Leanne calls me angrily saying she had to leave work early (only by 30 minutes) because she had to pick up our son since I refused.I told her our son didn\u2019t need to be picked up and I told him I\u2019d get him in the morning and that he was just bored. She got upset and said he was probably home sick and too embarrassed to tell me and he shouldn\u2019t have to stay somewhere he didn\u2019t want to be.\n\nWe argued a little, then I went to bed.

So, instead of telling you that their friend wants to do something dangerous or the 20-year-old brother is acting creepy, the kid claims to be sick or bored. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re tired or if it seems rude for your kid to leave early.", "YTA. Your son reached out to you in the middle of the night and expressed that he was uncomfortable and wanted to come home. Your first priority as a parent should be to ensure that your child is safe and comfortable. Instead, you dismissed his concerns and refused to go pick him up, forcing your wife to leave work early to do so. It's not about whether he was actually sick or not, but rather that he expressed a need to come home and you failed to provide that support. Your wife's frustration with you is completely understandable, and it's important that you prioritize your son's needs in the future.", "YTA. Congratulations you just taught your kid that they can\u2019t count on you.", "YTA.\n\nKids aren't always 100% truthful about upsetting situations. He reached out to the parent who was supposed to be available to bail him out tonight and you said No. \n\nYou need to be willing to be that parent or you need to tell him no sleepovers unless mom is available. But you do not leave a kid who is asking for a pick-up in the middle of the night.\n\nYour wife knows that. She was willing to drop everything and run *just in case*.\n\nHow shitty would you feel blowing off your duty if it turned out he was molested? Or trying to get out of a violent situation?", "ALWAYS pick your kids up. If you won't pick them up when they are little, they won't call you when they are teenagers!!!", "YTA. Sleepovers are not something to be toyed with. If a kid wants to leave, let them. Making them stay somewhere they are uncomfortable even if harmless can be very damaging.", "YTA. You really couldn't take 15 minutes to go pick up your own son? You suck as a dad and a husband. Your ten year old should be able to depend on you when he needs you, and you just proved to him he can't. Then you have your poor wife, already having to deal with working nights, which really sucks, who in turn had to sacrifice her time and money to pick up your slack.\n\nETA: The kid is TEN. He could've had different reasons besides being bored for not wanting to be there anymore, and he is not turning his mom against his dad, FFS! When he couldn't count on his dad, he went to his mom, which is probably a habit that will continue now as he grows up. You people in the comments saying N T A are messed up.", "YTA - Listen, with the way the world is these days, you need to be with open eyes & ears 24/7. If your kid tells you to pick him up from a sleepover or anywhere for that matter, do not pass go, do not collect $200 , PICK UP YOUR KID asap, no questions asked . \n\nNow he knows he can\u2019t rely on you and God forbid something happens , you\u2019ll be the last one to know . Please don\u2019t EVER do this again and apologize to your child & wife .\n\nPs -Take him out so you can have some bonding time & ask him what happened that night . You never know man , never be too trusting when it comes to your children. \n\nYou are a father, you are your child\u2019s first line of defense against the world & this world we are living in right now is not a kind place papa. Always bear that in mind please .", "YTA. He probably was homesick or wanted to sleep in his own bed. Kids need to know they can count on us, and that we\u2019re going to be there if needed. You told him to tough it out, instead of getting him and trying to find out what was really at play.", "YTA but i want to hopefully just give some insight ? I was a highly anxious kid and sleepovers were EXTREMELY hard for me. i would be totally fine often until the middle of the night and then it would hit, i would be wide awake, and inevitably spiral until i called my parents to come get me. they never said no, they never made me feel bad, and i always knew i could count on them. i eventually grew out of that but around 14 or so it came back HARD. i was a TEENAGER who could barely get through a sleepover at my best friends house. a place where i had slept for years, and a family i knew i was safe with. it was mortifying to have to ask to go home, but that nighttime anxiety was worse. my parents STILL supported my needs. \n\nwhen i was 19 i had my first encounter being faced with drinking and driving. My first call? my mom! who safely came and picked me up and made sure i knew i had made the right, safe choice. building trust like this is so so so important and i want for you the same kind of relationship i get to have with my parents. I\u2019m 24 and when i\u2019m having a bad day, my first call will always be to mom or dad - half the time just to hear their voice or swing by for a hug. \n\nbe the person your son knows he can call any time day or night. be a hero now before he\u2019s an angsty teen, and never underestimate the little things that signal to your child you have their back.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m always astounded when parents can\u2019t understand the message they are sending their kids and then wonder why your relationship is shit later in life. \n\nThis basically went-\n\nSon: Dad can I depend on you?\n\nDad: No", "You told a 10yo to \"Tough it out\"? Really? The kid seeks his father for help and you just chose to say \"Later\"?\nYou shouldn't be surprised if the kid loses faith/trust in you. Think about it. YTA.", "YTA When your minor kid calls you to come get them, you do that. \n\nThis was the first time he did so. You should have driven the FIFTEEN minutes to go get him and make sure he was safe.", "YTA maybe he was bored and maybe he was too embarrassed/worried/whatever to say. If he knew his mom was working but called her anyway, something may have been up.", "YTA", "YTA. Always pick up your kids. Even when they are wrong.", "YTA you put yourself/sleep ahead of your child who is only 10.  A good parent would have sacrificed losing a little sleep to get a child who sounds like it was uncomfortable wanting to go home.  I don't blame your wife for being pissed at you", "YTA your son needed you and you failed him.", "YTA. \n\nMy parents were like this. Guess what I learned from it? That I\u2019d rather figure things out for myself before calling them, and I got myself into plenty of dangerous situations because I didn\u2019t want to call them as I got older. \n\nMy 10 year old will rarely actually make it through a sleepover. She\u2019s scared of the dark and would rather sleep at home but she still wants to try to have the sleepover experience. She\u2019ll call me at 12,2,4 am if she needs me. She knows I\u2019ll never be mad at her for needing me and I\u2019ll always be there no questions.", "YTA absolutely 100%. Oh you don't wanna drive the short 15 minutes because your kid feels uncomfortable? Wow! Parent of the year award to you! Dawg, that's your kid. If he's 3 hours away and feels uncomfortable you get tf up and go get him. Grow up and be a real parent.", "YTA.  Middle of the night pick-ups are very common when kids first start having sleepover.  If you weren\u2019t willing to do it, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the sleepover.\n\nBut congratulations.  Your kid now knows which parent he can trust and which parent he cannot.", "YTA, it shouldn\u2019t matter if nothing is wrong at all, your child should be able to call you at all times and you should be understanding\n\n\nMy son has been to his friends house many many many times, but this last time he rang and asked me to get him, was about midnight\u2026 so what did I do\u2026. I went and got him. Nothing was wrong, he just didn\u2019t want to stay and wanted to come home.\n\n\nYou are you child\u2019s safe space, and you\u2019ve  just shown they can\u2019t even rely on their safety person.", "YTA. Pick up, no questions asked. Did it for my son a month ago. The rule is anytime, any reason, anywhere, any age, no questions asked.", "YTA. Way to remind your wife AND your kid that when they Don\u2019t need you and can\u2019t rely on you. \nI am sure you will be blindsided when she leaves and he does not want to hang out.", "YTA. Sounds like it was his first sleepover at this kid\u2019s house, and he couldn\u2019t sleep for whatever reason. You really expected a ten-year-old to lie awake for four hours? I honestly don\u2019t know how you could get back to sleep in that situation.", "YTA your son now knows but to call you if he ever needs something", "Honestly yes you are the asshole.  kids need there parents  as someone they can rely on  with something like that it shouldn't matter why   you go pick them up  ask them when they get in car if they want to talk about it  if not  leave it at that tell them if they want to they can tell you later and you take them home.     \n\n\nif you cant suport them in something small like this  then they know that you wont suport them when it is something major. And god forbid it was actualy something inportant that they  wernt ready to talk about yet cause  you burnt that bridge in one simple action.", "your wife had to leave work \u201conly by 30 minutes\u201d after she got in and you couldn\u2019t drive 30 minutes to bring your son home?", "YTA. I think you meed to consider that your kid might have had more of a reason than he was telling you. \n\nMaybe my friends were bigger assholes than others and this didn\u2019t happen to anyone else. But I remember sleepovers being pretty brutal sometimes. From my recollection there was plenty of bullying and the girls seemed to gang up on and target one girl for the night. I\u2019m almost positive I called my mom to pick me up when it was my turn to be the target and probably told her I was sick because I was too embarrassed to say why I wanted to go home. I know I called her once because a girls house was infested with mice and I couldn\u2019t sleep but didn\u2019t tell my Mom the real reason because I didn\u2019t want her to keep me from ever going back there again.\n\nI think other comments have touched on it but you really don\u2019t want to set a precedent of not being available when your kid calls and wants your help in a social setting. While it\u2019s entirely possible your kid was just bored, it\u2019s not a gamble I\u2019d take.", "YTA. And when you're son gets older and is in trouble, you're the last person he'll call because he knows now that he count on you", "YTA you failed your kid congrats", "YTA. You abandoned and neglected your child for your own selfish needs. \n\nI hope he does the same when you\u2019re old and frail and need help.", "My Dad would always come get me from a sleepover and it made me feel.so much safer. Giant YTA", "YTA. Your son wanted to come home and you just taught him he can\u2019t come to you unless he\u2019s willing to tell you a good enough reason right away.", "YTA he could have been uncomfortable, unsafe, assaulted or a million other things! YOU should have been there to pick him up as soon as he called you!", "YTA. I hope your son never needs you to pick him from a bad situation in the future, because you\u2019re teaching him now not to waste his breath with the call.", "YTA.\n\nYour wife was WORKING, and you were AWAKE ANYWAY.", "Info: why couldn\u2019t your wife wait another 30 minutes till the end of her shift to pick him up?\n\nTo be clear I\u2019m a believer in picking up kids/teens when asked.", "Soft YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s 10. He\u2019s a long way off having a realistic concept of forward thinking in a situation like this. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019s going to learn the complex lesson from this that you\u2019re hoping he does. At 10 he just wants to have fun with his friend, and then the same instinct wore off and he wants to come home.\n\nIt\u2019s also a pretty young age to have sleep overs and this is one of the safer reasons as to why it might not be a good idea in the first place. Not to go straight to the worst possibility but at 10 he likely wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to communicate discomfort beyond \u2018I\u2019m bored\u2019 or \u2018I want to come home\u2019. \n\nYou absolutely could have given your wife a heads up as to what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re awake, she\u2019s awake and working.", "YTA. It\u2019s possible something was making him uncomfortable and he wanted to come home. Maybe someone made a comment or he just got a vibe and didn\u2019t sit right with him. If your kid is sleeping over at someone\u2019s house and they ask to come home, you should take them home.", "I think YTA. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to you, it could be a big deal to him. Like others have said, maybe he was uncomfortable or embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to share the reason so he said he was bored. You should be there for your kid no matter the time or reason. Try to talk to him and figure out if something happened. If this happens again, maybe he can\u2019t go to sleepovers for a while. If it\u2019s a one time thing then maybe he was just feeling off. There\u2019s no way to know, but what I do know is that if my kids ever called me in the middle of the night to pick them up, I\u2019d be there no questions asked.", "Info: Is this his first sleepover?\n\nThe first couple of sleepovers can be hard. Hey may have been uncomfortable, cold, lonely, scared...etc\n\nHeck, he might've had to poop and was embarrassed to do it there. \n\nIt was only a 30min drive, you would've lost an hr of sleep tops getting him.\n\nNow he probably feels you don't care about him.", "YTA", "YTA. Sometimes adults get a bad vibe suddenly when nothing happened that could be reported; they just didn't feel safe or comfortable. Your child may not have the language to express what he was feeling or why. All you've shown him is that he can't depend on you if his reasoning or explanation isn't good enough to you. It was a big enough deal that he didn't just listen to you; he called his mother. What would you have done or said if something happened to him that night?", "YTA. I can remember attempting several sleep overs at that age and always getting home sick and wanting to go home. Would it have killed me to stay? Of course not. But I am so grateful my parents picked me up every single time.", "Sounds like you\u2019re setting the precedent that youre going to have pick your kid up when you\u2019re at work and wife\u2019s asleep.

He's probably not been to many sleepovers.  He wanted to come home. Either he was bored or uncomfortable.  You shouldn't have brushed him off.", "YTA", "Yta", "If my son called me at 2am asking to be picked up because he was uncomfortable, I\u2019d be out the door and on my way in about 30 seconds. My son is 26 and lives on his own, and this is as true today as it was when he was 10. I\u2019m his mom, and he knows he can count on me when he needs me. \n\nOP, YTA", "YTA- calling the parents for a late-night pickup is a time-honored sleepover ritual. It's part of the contract in giving permission.", "YTA. Congratulations on letting your son know he can\u2019t count on you so now he knows to go straight to the parent he can count on", "YTA. Put your child first.", "YTA now your son will never trust you or come to you.", "YTA. So you had to sacrifice a little sleep for your kid BOOHOO!!! Much better than your wife explaining to a boss she has to leave work early, drive twice as long as you, because you didn\u2019t want to spend 30 minutes of what could be sleep to help out your son. As a kid I flaked on sleepovers fairly frequently and my parents never complained. Don\u2019t be surprised if your son goes NC when he\u2019s older", "YTA. You\u2019re a shit dad.", "You were already awake, would it have killed you to  go get him?", "My kids and I had a contract. They could call me anytime, any place and I would come and get them. No questions asked.\n\nUntil the next day. Then, they had to tell me what happened. We would find a solution or skills to help in the same type of situation. \n\nCalled trusting your parents no matter what.\n\nYTA.", "YTA as others have said your child reached out to you in an uncomfortable situation and you just dismissed them. You\u2019ve now taught them not to trust that you\u2019ll be there for them. Maybe he couldn\u2019t say why he really wanted to come home because someone was listening. My parents no matter what time day or night if I called and said I wanted to come home they instantly came and got me. That taught me when I got older and felt uncomfortable they\u2019d be there.", "My son called home from a sleepover.. Telling me he was bored. I went and got him. He wasn't bored, he felt alone and nervous. Always get your kid.", "YTA. \u201cMy son needed me but I valued sleep more so told him to wait.\u201d \u201cMy wife was upset with me but I went back to bed because I don\u2019t care about my family as much as I care about myself.\u201d", "Not that you seem like the type to care, but be sure your son will NEVER forget that when he was 10 he needed you and you weren't there for him, he even might look like he forgave you, but with each passing year he'll realize more a more the meaning of it. Good job! YTA", "My child is 30. If he said \u2018Mum come pick me up\u2019 I would be in my car in my PJs, on Google Maps to get to him. YTA", "Almost YTA\n\nIt's common sense to know that if a kid wants you to pick them from some place, then you have to, no questions asked, especially if they are underage.\n\nThe fact that your kid immediately called your wife after you makes me sense something was wrong. Kids getting bored is not something unique. \n\nChildren need to be reassured multiple times that they can reach out to their parents if they are uncomfortable. You have failed in this particular scenario.\n\nI get that children need to be made aware of life's difficulties and realities, but 2 AM in the night is probably not the right time for it.", "YTA\n\nThis is on you. Agreeing to let your child sleep elsewhere is committing to pick them up if they call.\n\nYour 10 year-old is alone with adults you barely know\u2026", "Info: \"I asked him if he was feeling okay, if something happened,he said no.\"\n\nNo he's not feeling well or no nothing happened?", "YTA. You prioritized yourself over both your son and your wife. There will come a day that your child stops reaching out to you if they feel like you aren\u2019t going to support them 100% of the time. Things like this stick with kids for a life time and creates resentment in marriages. You really let 2 people down who needed you. Not to mention this is a safety concern. Your son made his discomfort clear and you completely disregarded it. I hope you look at this as a learning lesson and make it up to your family.", " Your kids said dad I'm uncomfy come get me and you said .... I don't wanna share 15 minutes stay uncomfy\n\n\nYta", "Unfortunately YTA and you have now taught your ten year old that he can't depend on you. Others have explained it better than I can.\n\nYou're a father. You don't get a day off from that. Ever. Even if you're asleep or your kid isn't under your roof. He is still your son at someone else's house. You get up and go get him. (And really? Over a 15 minute drive?) Sleep deprivation is just part of having a kid!\n\nApologize to your wife and then your son. Sit down and have a talk. Set up a code system in case he's uncomfortable (ours was that my ear really hurt). Then explain if he really just has trouble sleeping or is bored then he needs to think twice about sleepovers and maybe just have playdates for a while longer yet. He may just not be ready for sleepovers, or you need to teach him to cool it on the sugar and caffeine in the evening. You gotta be a parent.", "YTA \nBecause you told your son to stick out a sleepover that was 15 minutes away. \nYou realize that at sleepovers is where most childhood SA happens. \nSo now your kid learned that if something happened to him. I cannot count on dad.\n\nPlus like the sleepover wasn\u2019t guaranteed to give you a nights rest. It\u2019s an extended playdate that both parents agree to. If he wants to leave. He should be able to leave with the support of his parents.", "Congratulations, this will be discussed with your child's therapist one day.

Nice job wearing the pants!", ">She got upset and said he was probably home sick and too embarrassed to tell me and he shouldn\u2019t have to stay somewhere he didn\u2019t want to be.\n\nDoes your son often have trouble being honest about his feelings with you?", "NTA I think it\u2019s good for a ten-year-old to understand other people (even their parents) have boundaries and the world doesn\u2019t revolve around their boredom. Wife is coddling her baby past the point of necessity.", "NTA. Lots of helicopter parents in here that are paranoid just because it was a sleepover?\n\nThis kid is 10, and OP is his father. He should know his kid well enough to be able to make a judgment call if there was reason to be concerned this was an unsafe situation.\n\nIf his wife didn\u2019t feel the same way, this could have been addressed with some communication including a phone call to the kid to clear things up, not getting the bugout bag and making it into an emergency.", "NTA. The kid didn't say he was uncomfortable; he said he was bored. Maybe if he had been sleeping at 2:00 in the morning, he wouldn't be bored. 10 to 1, they let him play his game until he gets tired at home.", "NTA being bored isn\u2019t a valid reason imo.", "NTA he was bored not in danger. And at 10 he should understand commitments to friends. This whole post seems to think you should allow the whole world to revolve around your kid which is Ludacris. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, she should have backed you up and not picked him up either. That way she wouldn\u2019t have had to leave work early, and your kid wouldn\u2019t think they can just ask one parent to cave in when the other won\u2019t. She could have talked to you about it later, privately, if she had a problem with it.", "So your son played your wife against you and she's ok with that.  That's...not good.

When I was a kid and someone got picked up from a sleepover early it was weird. Imagine everyone sleeping and then at 3 am a sudden knock and a parent picking up a child. Even more weird. Wouldn't invite that kid back.", "NTA The kid needs to learn follow-through.  I bet if he joined some sort of sports team and wanted later to quit, she's let him.", "NTA\n\nOnly because I feel you just took everything literally. Like kid is just bored no other issues, and you gotta work in the morning. So I can see you thinking ok then you\u2019re safe and bored, so just be bored or go to sleep. If the kid wasn\u2019t forthright I can see that go over your head. \n\nI take things literally sometimes, and used to generally trust people at their word. So that\u2019s why I can see someone else doing this. \n\nTruly if a sleepover he wants to come home he should. If this is an issue to pick him up due to work, then he should not be allowed sleepovers.\n\nAlso it\u2019s good to come up with a safe phrase or safe text, so they can get out of situations they don\u2019t like without letting the people they are with know.", "I think you both did wrong.\n\nYou for not picking him up. He is 10 and are probably not good with expressing his emotions. If he contact you in the middle of the night you pick your child up. Thats a part of parenthod.\n\nYour wife because she could have told him to wait 30 minutes for her to finish working. Thats also a part of parenting, che can't always cater to him asap. Some times he has to wait, work is one of those moments.\n\nBut I understand fully that she was pissed at you.", "NTA.\n\nI think he should have just toughed it out and didn't need his parent to pick him up. You make the right call.\n\nI would be surprised if this want the first time she drooped everything to coddle the kid.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't HAVE to pick him up. She WANTED to.\n\nSon could have called a cab, picked up an uber. He knew though that one of you would pick him up", "NTA", " Nah", "NTA", "NTA, but your wife is. Nothing was wrong, and kids have to learn that sometimes boredom has to be endured. Boredom isn\u2019t important enough to disrupt everyone\u2019s schedule. Giving in to unimportant things like this teaches kids how to be spoiled and entitled. By the sound of things, you Would have gotten him if it were something important and that\u2019s why you\u2019re not ta. Kids won\u2019t learn discretion or how to sort priorities if they\u2019re given in to and coddled like what your wife did. At 10 years old your son should have started learning about important versus unimportant for a couple of years already.

We have a 10 year old son together. Leanne works nights usually, and we had allowed my son to have a sleepover with a kid his age, we\u2019ve met his parents before and they\u2019ve had several play dates.  Last night he stayed at their house.\n\nAround 2 am I get woken up to my son texting me and says he\u2019s really bored and can\u2019t sleep and wants to be picked up. I asked him if he was feeling okay, if something happened,he said no. I had work at 6 am so I did not want to go out and drive 15 minutes to pick him up. I told him to tough it out and I\u2019d get up for work early and pick him up. About 10 minutes later Leanne calls me angrily saying she had to leave work early (only by 30 minutes) because she had to pick up our son since I refused.I told her our son didn\u2019t need to be picked up and I told him I\u2019d get him in the morning and that he was just bored. She got upset and said he was probably home sick and too embarrassed to tell me and he shouldn\u2019t have to stay somewhere he didn\u2019t want to be.\n\nWe argued a little, then I went to bed. After work my wife was upset with me still.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Anytime your child calls you in the middle of the night, It means that something is wrong.  Whatever age they are. Six, ten, sixteens, twenty-three.  No, they do NOT have to give you the reason. Sure, it\u2019s nice to know, but, the only thing you NEED to know is that your child wants to come home NOW. Maybe the child is just bored. Maybe the child is homesick. Maybe they\u2019re scared. Maybe something just doesn\u2019t feel -right-, and all they want is someone safe to let them know that they care. You\u2019re the parent. You\u2019re supposed to be someone safe. You\u2019ve just shown your child that you can\u2019t be trusted to be there, and you\u2019ve also shown your wife that you can\u2019t be trusted.", "YTA", "YTA I remember one time I felt homesick. I called my mother just to say goodnight and I didn\u2019t say homesick, but she knew. I\u2019m 63 now and still feel my mother was just magical. (And I never did that again but I was uneasy there.) I think knowing she would come and get me made me more comfortable going forward.", "YTA", "YTA- I can\u2019t tell you how many panic attacks I had at sleep overs. Idfk why, I just could. Not. Do.

YTA, in sooo many ways.", " yta\n\nwhen i was a kid i went through a similar situation where i slept over someone's house and wanted to leave, and their parents wouldn't let me call my parents. from then on my parents promised my siblings and i that if at any point, no matter what, they would come pick us up no questions asked.\n\nyour child needed you, and you had no concern for them. it does not matter if he was having a good time, bad time, or anything in between, if he expresses he wants to go home, you get your kid.", "Not only did you let down your son, you completely disrespected your wife and HER job pushing this into her while you slept. \n\nYTA so much", "YT Major A\n\nKids sometimes can't verbalize or even know when they're in a situation they want out of. \n\nThey may be afraid of looking weak if they have an (obviously) overbearing dad. \n\nThey may sense something not right in the home they can't put into words. \n\nWhen our kid started going to other houses and having sleepovers we did the following:\n\n- from a young age they always had a phone.\n\n- we had (and still have) a secret code word that is innocuous and common but not normally used, and if they use it then WE tell THEM we have to pick them up for some concocted reason, and let the other parents know we're on our way.\n\nWe told our kid this was a strong but secret family rule, that we will ALWAYS get them if they need/want us to. They have never used it, but we still do a quick \"code word\" check on occasion so they always remember.\n\nHaving a no-questions-asked rescue procedure in place has given them what we feel is the confidence to both:\n\nA) be able to have more freedom. \n\n-and-\n\nB) the empowerment to use their judgement. \n\nSo far so good for us.\n\nI hope for this poor kid's sake that the dad learns that the way kids get strong and independent is by having a solid foundation of trust in their family, NOT by being left feeling trapped/scared/abandoned/ignored by a parent who won't take 15 minutes to help them when they need it.", "YTA", "A BIG AH. you don't know what happened to your son and instead of picking him up to talk you say no??? nothing might have happened, but what happened could be serious and he couldn't tell you by text message.\nyour son is 10 years old!!! 10!!!

If there was something REALLY wrong at the sleepover, do you think your kid could say it in front of the other kid\u2019s parents? You let him down. MAJORLY.

I\u2019m guessing your wife handled all nighttime issues in the past? \n\nAnd you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal she left work 30 minutes early? For some jobs you get written up for that. There\u2019s a chance you lose your job. And when evaluating time roles around, she may not get as high a review or raise because \u201cshe leaves work early\u201d (even if it was only once.

I always picked up my kids when they called. When my son was a young adult and found himself in a bad spot, he knew he could call me. I kept my kids as safe as possible.

Now your son knows not to ring dad because he won't show up.", "Yta", "YTA - your young child wants to come home you let them come home. THEN you assess the situation. If all it really was is that they\u2019re bored, i wouldn\u2019t let them go again. I agree it\u2019s not a valid reason, but I err on the side of caution, I\u2019d rather be annoyed than regretful that they actually felt unsafe and were making excuses.", "YTA.", "YTA. Your 10yo did not text you at 2am because he was bored. It was a cry for help and you told him he couldn\u2019t count on you. Sleepovers are not the same as being someplace else. Things go wildly wrong, just like at parties. He probably didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling you exactly what was going on and that\u2019s FINE. He said come and get me and that should have been all you needed to hear. Questions are for the morning. Congratulations, he\u2019ll never count on you again.", "YTA. Your kid was depending on you, doesn\u2019t matter the reason, you get your butt out of bed and get them. You showed him he can\u2019t count on you.", "Great lesson there.

You suck.", "YTA. Other commenters have more effective communicated why so I'll be succint: you suck", "YTA. My parents always placed their phones with high volume so they could hear them when I would call and asked to be picked up from a sleepover. They knew most times I would asked to be picked up bc my anxiety would act up, they still let me choose if I wanted to go bc they were letting me be independent but also always told me I could call them to take me home bc after all, they also wanted to teach me that I could count on them. \nYou took that \"safety\" feeling from your child.", "Damn. YTA, big time. At least he can rely on mom. He'll remember that for a loooong time.", "NTA, your child is learning how to manipulate you and mom.", "You're TA for quickly blowing it off. You gave a brief description, but what if he actually opened up to mom instead and was homesick or scared? Also if he was truly just bored you should've given your wife a heads up before trying to go back to sleep so this situation didn't happen.", "Ew yta", "Personally, my child just has to say come get me and I am on my way. I have spent my entire life in uncomfortable situations and too scared to say something. And if I said something, I would find an excuse and hope it was enough for the other person to help me.\n\nThis was small, but he did learn that Mom is reliable and Dad will blow him off. When he is in an impossible situation, he will call Mom. I am going to say YTA because you passed on the chance to build up trust. It\u2019s not broken, but you better fix and shore this up, if you want your son to trust you in the teenage years. But hey, you do you and your wife will be a mother.", "YTA. He's 10. I have a daughter that is 11 and I've told her that if she's ever uncomfortable in an environment to tell me and I'll come immediately. \n\nYou don't know what was actually going through your son's mind. You don't know what went on throughout the evening that made him feel the way he did. The fact alone that child predators exist is reason enough for me to decide that I'd never want my child to feel like he/she couldn't rely on me. And if he doesn't feel like he can rely on you at 10, he certainly won't feel like he can rely on you when he's 16, 18, 21, etc and finds himself in a situation with real, adult consequences that he needs help navigating.\n\n2:00 AM is not the time to make a point. 2:00 AM is the time to *pick up your kid* and talk about the reasons (and whether or not they were valid) later.", "YTA, your son may not have felt comfortable telling you what was going on while in their house. Even if he really was just bored (which unless he has always had problems sleeping and is usually up at 2 in the morning at home), he deserves to be able to count on both of his parents. He is a little kid, he shouldn't be taught he has to stay somewhere just because his dad would be inconvenienced. His excuse though seems very forced and likely him trying to tell you he didn't feel right about the situation without saying it because someone who worried him might have heard and he didn't want to let them know.", "YTA.\n\n\nYour wife had to leave work early because you behaved like a lazy, immature asshole instead of being a grown up.", "Sure, he could have stayed. But you taught him he can\u2019t rely on you. It was an inconvenience to you. YTA", "Question: why didn't you let your wife know your son asked to come home and you thought he should tough it out and said no? It seems to me the lack of communication here is the issue, we all like to get sleep, sometimes you just have to finish what you are doing first because of your responsibilities.", "YTA. im 17. my dad came to pick up at 3 am when he had work in the morning this year. i felt unsafe but was terrified or asking for help out of fear my dad would be angry at me. instead, he came at got me, made sure i was okay, and didn't judge me. you NEED to be there for your kid.", "YTA. Before my kids ever went to a sleepover they knew that if they felt uncomfortable for any reason they could call or text. And if they wanted to go home and needed an excuse for the other kid or the parents they were to say that they felt sick. Sometimes it as as simple as a cat has peed on the couch they are sleeping on or their friend is being rude to them, sometimes it is as complex as an uncle who is making uncomfortable comments or illegal stuff is going on and your child wants to leave.   \nYou had a chance to guarantee your child's safety and show them that their father would always show up for them, and you failed. And then foisted the responsibility off on your wife, who is smarter about the many varied ways in which a sleepover might go wrong. Sleepovers aren't mandatory or something you have to tough out, my dude.", "NTA.\n\nChildren shouldn\u2019t be coddled and this is a good learning experience for him.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll be bothering the parents to let him out of the house after they allowed him to sleepover.", "YTA. You prioritised your needs (sleep!) over those of your child. You also showed your wife and son they can\u2019t rely on you. Great job Dad.", "You are DEFINITELY TA. Your 10yr old child reached out at 2am and you blew him off so you could sleep. He called his Mom and she left work to get him. At least he knows which parent he can count on.", "YTA, you just taught him that you are not someone he can come to. way to go.", "YTA. We aren\u2019t telling our kids to \u201cman up\u201d when they\u2019re uncomfortable and uncertain in their surroundings.

I also want to commend you because when you described the situation, you seemed to be writing it as objectively as possible and seeking guidance rather than trying to convince readers that you're not the asshole. A good parent is a parent who is open to being wrong.", "When I was 7 or 8 I attended my very first sleepover. I'm unsure why, but I was very scared and unable to sleep. So I snuck downstairs to call my dad to pick me up\n\nGuess what, my dad showed up. Woke up my friend's parents. Then they all proceeded to reassure me, then I went to sleep and my dad picked me up the next morning.\n\nYTA.", "My greatest memory of my dad was when I was 10 and he picked me up in the middle of the night from a sleepover bc I was \u201cbored\u201d he knew I was just home sick and wanted to sleep in my own bed", "YTA. Also for future reference, have a code phrase. When my kids were younger, if something at a sleepover made them feel uncomfortable or they wanted to come home, they would text me \u201cmom, I really think I\u2019m going to throw up\u201d. Some may downvote for the little fib, but it worked. Doing this makes it more comfortable than having them say, \u201cshe\u2019s being mean to me\u201d, or \u201cher brother keeps sitting closer to me\u201d, etc. When my daughter became a teen, I told her if she ever needed a ride home, if she ever drank too much or who she rode with was drinking, call me and no questions asked. This did happen on more than one occasion. For me, it was more important to know she could count on me to get her home safely than whatever friend got the alcohol.", "YTA", "YTA Pick your damned kid up when he calls. Are you kidding me?", "YTA, didn't you ever get homesick at summer camp or whatever, sleepyhead?", "NTA. He was in no danger and needed to stick it out. Ten is a good age to learn this.", "YTA. You are irresponsible.", "NTA. Kid needs to learn if he decides he wants to go do something - like a sleepover - as long as he\u2019s not being harmed or in danger and he\u2019s simply \u201cbored\u201d at 2am when he should be sleeping - given that he\u2019s going to be picked up in a few hours in the morning anyway - he needs to deal with it because that\u2019s life.", "NTA. Your child was expressing a want, not a need, and wants can be delayed or a second priority. If you had the option of going to work the next day on an interrupted sleep schedule or letting you child be bored for a few hours due to a their own decision, I'd chose the former every time. I've noticed a trend on this sub where if parent refuses to drop everything to cater their kid, then people will do mental gymnastics to justify voting them the AH, and  I'm over it. Children do not always have to be center of the world, and their desires do not always have to be the number one priority. I hope that this isn't the norm if normal parenting, because if so, then the next generation will grow up to be very entitled.", "YTA,  if you get a call in the middle of the night from someone you care about and they need a ride, you get up and go get them.  You go get them!", "YTA. Way to prove he can\u2019t come to you.", "Wow. YTA. Your son wanted to come home. Maybe he was just bored or maybe he didn\u2019t want to tell you the real reason.

Maybe he did not want to tell you the real reason why he wanted to go home because he did not want to say in front of his friend.  He should have been able to count on you and you failed, just because you had to get up for work in the morning.  You showed him your sleep is more important than him counting on you.  You need to apologize to him and tell him no matter what, you will be there for him, to pick him up no matter what and that you screwed up big time.", "Look, this is more complicated. I get where dad said tough it out. And I get where mom said no, I had to get him. He was probably more upset than he was willing to say to dad. He may have been more expressive to mom. As a mom, I would have gotten the kid. I remember being scared at a sleepover at my best friends house at the same age and being scared for no real reason and wanting to go home. It happens. \n\nI don\u2019t think kid is permanently scarred or anything. He has parents who live snd care for him. All will be well. But maybe good to discuss what the issue was and let him be open if he was just scared of being away from home. Totally normal.", "YTA. There may have been something shady going on.

You may save his life.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve shown your son that he can\u2019t rely or come to you when he needs you. Even if it seemed petty it doesn\u2019t matter.

I threw a tantrum cause my mum wanted to drive me on my first day of school when I was 5, but I wanted to take the bus. I remember one sleepover when I was around 10 where I just could not fall asleep. Nothing went wrong and I had spent the night many times before at this girls place. I was just feeling very overwhelmed that night and just wanted to be at my own home. Well after midnight I ended up waking up my friend to ask her to wake up her parents. She was upset that I wanted to leave but the next day all was resolved. Her parents woke up and tried to comfort me as I was now in tears at this point. They called my parents and my mum came right away no questions asked. Once we were in the car on the way home that\u2019s when she asked if anything had happened. I said no and she was a bit irritated as she was tired but she is always grumpy when tired. Nothing went wrong but I just was not feeling that night at all. I remember getting home and being so relieved and just much more relaxed. I still remember this and will forever love my mum for this. Her and my dad would always be there if I needed them and this was evidence of it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to call you an asshole because you may not have thought this deep, or considered it from other perspectives. You were also tired and probably irritated. But this will definitely have an effect on him so I think you should apologize to both him and your wife.

What if your kid was being sexually harassed or afraid of being assaulted?

Good thing his mom got him.", "the fact he even reached out and asked means something was actually wrong, kids will always try to hang with their friends as long as possible, even in the face of discomfort or peer pressure they\u2019ll try to push through to not be seen as the one who pussied out or whatever", "I agree with the second paragraph, but not the first. This reasoning is exactly why YTA here. Maybe he was bored. But maybe he couldn\u2019t tell you why he really needed to leave. The fact that he went to your wife indicates the second.

He can be uncomfortable or bored for a few more hours. \ud83e\udd2f", "But the kid WASN\u2019T uncomfortable, he was just bored. Kids need to learn to deal with boredom and become responsible. NTA. Too much coddling happens these days.", "So are bored and board.", "Exactly. He didn\u2019t say uncomfortable, he said bored. I don\u2019t see why OP is the T A for this. Unless there is some hidden code here. NTA.", "Maybe a 10 year old doesn\u2019t feel comfortable saying why he wants to come home in the middle of the night while other people are likely in earshot.  How many times have you been \u201cbored\u201d at 2am? You\u2019d just go to sleep.  Something else was up and OP couldn\u2019t read between the lines.", "Who cares. What matters is his kid was in a vulnerable situation and was asking to be picked up, and was ignored.", "I wouldn't leave it to a ten year old to articulate the nuances of his feelings", "A 10 yo reaches out at 2 am because he\u2019s bored? Really?! Because kids who are comfortable in their surroundings are usually past tf out at 2 am. I\u2019ve yet to meet a 10 yo who isn\u2019t up at 2 am because \u201cboredom\u201d.", "Kids don\u2019t always feel like they can come right out and say/text that something is wrong in front of a friend. Also, sometimes kids can tell that something is \u201coff\u201d but can\u2019t quite articulate what it is. In either case, it\u2019s not uncommon for a kid to claim to be bored or sick instead of admitting whatever the real problem is.", "He\u2019s 10!!!", "yta... bored might be the kids way of saying they dont feel safe we tend to normalize girls not feeling safe but for some reason we assume boys always feel safe... if you insist on having kids then please take the time to be a parent to them... you cant just pick and choose when to parent  \nalso mum leaving work early is not easier mum might loose her job and how is she gonna pay for her kid if she has no job", "I also don\u2019t understand why mom didn\u2019t just have him wait 30 mins until her shift ended. Seemed like the better plan from the start.", "Agree!", "I agree. He was bored. Sometimes there are consequences. Kids have to be taught that mommy and daddy aren't always going to be there just because they are bored. What if they don't like school or heaven forbid once they are old enough to get a job they don't want to stay because it's boring.", "This. I mean the way OP presents it makes the request sound trivial and maybe that's really what was going on. idk. I always told my kids they could call any time of the day or night and I would come get them, no questions. And I've done it. It's the only way I know they'll feel comfortable calling when they really need it. Which has happened.", "The kid said he was bored.  Entirely possible the wife was right about him being embarrassed to give a real reason, or that one or more of his friends could see his texts.\n\nRegardless, this is the age where you lay that groundwork of \"I will come for you\" so that later, when there's stuff like alcohol or drugs involved, the kid will still reach out to you.", "Or the child didn't want to talk about something that happened. Better safe than sorry when your child is at another persons house", "Or his wife is right. But it doesn\u2019t matter, kid didn\u2019t want to be in that situation and now he knows to call mom cause dad\u2019s not going to help", "He asked his kid if he was okay or if anything was wrong and his kid said no, I'm just bored. It's not like these kids haven't hung out together before several times. The mom could have picked him up when she got off work (instead of leaving early,) and the dad could have gone back to bed like he did since he had to get up early. NTA.", "bored at 2am??? go to sleep........not sure why everyone is saying dad let the kid down, how about teaching the kid that he made a decision (to spend the night) and should not expect to be picked up at 2am which is crazy unless he was sick or hurt.\n\nDad is not AH for making the kid stick it out, however he could have messaged the wife \"hey jr said he is bored and I told him to stick it out\" then she could have gave her opinion.    And now jr knows when he does not get his way with dad he can call mom.  Communication is the real key here.", "No way the kid would ask to be picked up at 2am because he was bored.", "Guests are allowed to leave if they want to. This could have easily been a case of an older brother was giving him the creeps, one of the parents got drunk, he witnessed violence or other abuse, or just really doesn\u2019t feel right in that house.", "No one has to be polite when they are uncomfortable. He can very politely explain that he needs to go home, thank them for allowing him to come over, and that he will see them soon.", "Kid may have omitted some details. Maybe something happened that made him uncomfortable", "Lol. Lmao. \"dead wrong\" hopefully you don't have any kids cuz you're just as bad if not worse.", "Having gone into social work as an adult... I never worried about sleepovers going wrong. But that is something that isn't true for a lot of kids.", "Your kid wanted to come home. Odds are he told his friend\u2019s parent(s) this, which meant at least one of them was likely awake, waiting with him. The longer it took one of you to get there, the longer they were awake in the middle of the night.\n\nYour kid called you. There should be no reason that you say no when your kid says they need you.", "Because unlike you she realizes that if the kid asks to be picked up in the middle of the night is likely not just a whim.", "Seriously dude?? Ffs.", "I mean, in a lifespan of 85+ years then yes it absolutely is.", "My first sleep over was when I was 5, when we were getting ready for bed, I started crying that I missed my parents and after about ten minutes and a quick phone call to hear their voices I was absolutely fine and it never happened again.", "True, but it would be worth it for a kid who may not feel well/safe. Even if the kid is faking it bc you never know...\n\nBut I'd also be pissed if I was woken up at 2am by a kid who was faking it.", "Why isn\u2019t this more concerning for you? It\u2019s a place your kid has been before without a problem. Now all the sudden he\u2019s calling in the middle of the night asking you to come get him. Is it possible he is just bored and wants to leave? Sure. Or he may not have felt comfortable saying in front of others or even to you what the actual issue was. But there\u2019s so many other possibilities that would warrant an immediate pick up that I don\u2019t understand why you were comfortable risking it.", "At least he now knows not to text you when he needs something", "Has he ever called to be picked up before?", "This should probably be edited into the post.  Knowing this, I'd say NTA because if this sleepover was one of many, and the rest went off just fine, it sounds like your son WAS probably just bored, or else keeping things from you about maybe fighting with his friend.  At 2am, being 10 years old, he should just be sleeping.", "That you know of. Maybe something did happen and he wasn\u2019t comfortable telling you through text", "Why do you think they were awake?\n\nI think he couldn't sleep because it was a new house and evrybody else was asleep and he got homesik so he sent a sms to his dad to pick him up.", "Verbalize isn't over text", "It doesn't matter. What the kid needs at ten is to know that if he calls, his parents will come. It's how you develop the relationship you need to have at 17 when the kid drinks at a party and realizes he screwed up and shouldn't get behind the wheel. You need the 17 year old to know that if he calls, Dad will come no questions asked just like he did at 10. \n\nLots of moments aren't about the thing itself, they're about what you want your kid to know. This was one of them and Dad missed it.", "He was uncomfortable to reach out to his dad and then also his mom who he knew was at work. That\u2019s not just boredom. He probably just didn\u2019t know what to say to his dad or want the text to be on his phone that his friend could potentially see etc.", "The kid SAID he was bored, which would be a much more discreet thing to say if someone was making you feel UNCOMFORTABLE. It was 2am, if that kid felt safe he should have been passed out from slumber party exhaustion, not \u201cbored\u201d.", "The kid was still in the house - if he was uncomfortable and weirded out, he may not have been able to say it from fear of being overheard by whoever made him feel that way. Or he didn\u2019t want to seem like a \u201cwuss\u201d in front of the other boys so came up with a reason that may get him less likely to be bullied for it.\n\nAt the end of the day, we should all have autonomy over when we want to go home - especially to sleep, a vulnerable state. Whatever it is, kids should be able to rely on parents to get them to what they feels is safety until they can transport themselves around. If the consequence to that is no more sleepovers, fine, but OP should have gotten his child when he asked in that moment. Clearly it was a big deal enough to him that he called both his parents at 2 am to beg someone to come over and get him.", "Vulnerable?  Sorry I have been in a vulnerable situation.   One thing you are not is bored.    How about the kid being taught the lesson that sometimes  we do stuff because we agreed to do it.   Even if it is not as fun as we hoped it would be.  OP said he would pick him up before work for christ sake.  So Op NTA.", "Bullshit\n\nKid was bored and wanted to come home\n\nWhen person A didn\u2019t respond, he moved on to person B\n\nKid really learned how to manipulate, nothing more", "Not feeling safe?", "Here me out\u2026 I have a 9 year old. For at least 5 years if he\u2019s talking to me after 11 and before 6 he has gotten sick, is about to be sick, or has had an embarrassing accident. \nIf he reached out to me in the middle of the night I\u2019m otw because he doesn\u2019t cry wolf at night.", "What are you talking about?  you have to coordinate with the other parent and whoever it most makes sense to pick them up is the one who should pick them up. Op he should\u2019ve called his wife and explain what was going on and asked her to pick the child up on the way home from work or ask the kid if it was an emergency or if he could wait 30 minutes? We have no idea if the other kids parents were up or not the kid Could\u2019ve very well his own phone and use that goes dead without waking up the other kids parents. If the kid didnt  have phone it would likely be the other kids parents making the phone call", "Why is 10 too young to have a sleepover?", "That is a ludicrous justification.", "That makes sense. It is hard to remember how we felt growing up after so many years or to even put myself into those shoes.", "Yeah the lesson is if he needs something trivial then he can ask mom.", "He didn't need anything though, 10 is plenty old enough to understand his parents have responsibilities and there's nothing wrong with what the father did.", "Idk.. reading this makes me feel like he\u2019s ta. If his son has slept over there before and never had an issue, I would be really concerned that my kid was reaching out to me at 2am in a place they\u2019re usually comfortable. That would worry me a lot.", "Yea, I agree. It seemed at first that his kid had never slept over there. \n\nBut if he's stayed there before and never had any issues, wouldn't that be cause for concern?\n\nIf this is the first time, picking him up should be the move. And if nothing troublesome happened, then given a warning that the next time he spends the night he is expected to stay till morning. Obviously, there would be exceptions where calling home is acceptable.", "I don\u2019t think a 10 year old can just leave the house he\u2019s staying in without the adults knowing, whether because they were awake or the mom had to let them know she was taking the kid.", "At least this kid knows his mom will do that for him", "He was taught a lesson, that he can\u2019t depend on dad.", "the kid is barely double digits old maybe the kid is insecure or feels unsafe it happens", "I\u2019d hope to god a kid at a sleepover, particularly one at the age of 10, would know to not just, like, leave the house without letting the hosts know what was going on. Those parents, if they weren\u2019t awake already, would need to be before the kid left.\n\nI really don\u2019t give a shit about any of the other circumstances. I\u2019m a mom and if my son ever texts or calls me and says I need to come pick him up, I\u2019m going.\n\nSure, OP could\u2019ve done that. But he didn\u2019t. He told his kid to tough it out.", "What if the child was in a dangerous situation? Kids don't always articulate their fears if there is something seriously wrong. A parent's first responsibility is to make sure their child was safe. If the kid is awake at 2am and wanting to come home, it's not because they're \"bored\", it's much more likely that something scary has happened. If it's an abuse situation, it's much safer for a child to make up a white lie (I feel sick, I'm bored) and get into a safe zone rather than throwing accusations around in the middle of the night.", "Exactly if the kid ever needs help he can just call mom it's a good lesson to learn you can't always rely on people", "Wasn\u2019t the child his responsibility as he was doing nothing while his wife was at work? Make that make sense."]}
