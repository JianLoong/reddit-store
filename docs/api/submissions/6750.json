This is beside the point but our margins are slim because it's moreso a passion of mine to cook rather than for any monetary gain. I retired a decade ago pretty young so this has been my hobby and focus.\n\nWe also have a particular daughter who we're awaiting for an appointment to verify she is on the spectrum but she has tells already that make us and our pediatrician believe so. The big thing is particularity about food. For example, her diet is 90% cucumbers, crackers, cheese, and tomatoes, and it needs to be prepared a certain way. Like if her tomatoes are quartered, she will throw a tantrum.\n\nI broached to my wife the idea of a small side menu of, and I'm not sure how best to describe it without offense, \"Autism friendly\" appetizers and entrees. Things like mixed veggies and crackers, plain pasta with cheese, and so on. I'm developing it with my daughter in mind, so I'm basing it on her food preferences. It's still a work in progress but I'm also talking to some of our couple friends who have children on the spectrum for ideas.\n\nMy wife says it's infantilizing to have something like that on our menu and that I'm trying to appeal to a tiny tiny demographic despite our slim margins. She, instead, said that if people are not happy with our offerings they should eat elsewhere. It breaks my heart a little because I'm doing this for my daughter and other children like her, and to my mind, it incentivizes more customers, so in fact, it would maybe generate extra revenue.\n\nWe jointly own the property and have jointly come up with our menues, so we're at a standstill. I will very likely need to drop the topic and things go on as usual. I want to refer to this sub, however, and possibly take some of the comments here and push harder.

You could name the dishes you daughter helps create after her. Or give her a small section of the menu called \u201cName\u2019s\u201d Creations.", "YWBTA, although I think that's the wrong word for it. You clearly have the best intentions, and this comes from a place of wanting to help. But I think you need to do more research into autism.\nYes, people with autism sometimes have very specific food tastes, but what those are varies just as much as the favorite food choices of people off the spectrum. You're not going to find a theme common enough to create a menu.", "NAH. My son is on the spectrum, and I love the sentiment and where your heart\u2019s at. However, if you\u2019ve met one person on the spectrum\u2026then you\u2019ve met one person on the spectrum lol. Preferences vary wildly. I think there\u2019s opportunity here to cater to a more particular crowd and I\u2019m not creative enough to come up with a name for the sub-menu, but I wish you well!", "Nta. But u should rename it to sensory friendly or texture friendly", "NTA, But i dont think it needs to be a whole separate menu, just put a note and say you can do sensory friendly customizations because you and the chefs want to spread awareness for sensory issue with food and welcome those that may have such food preferneces.\n\nIm not autistic, but I have th ARFID that is the name for sensory and trauma based food sensory issues/ picky eating. I would have loved seeing that type of note on a menu because so many people are rude when I asked for plain pasta or sauces on the side.", "NTA but I don't think it will work. As a mother of a daughter with sensory processing disorder I know the struggles of picky eating and every child is different. So to say \"autism friendly menu\" means nothing. My child will love Mac and cheese for a month and then never like it again for a year. Maybe go with \"picky eaters menu\"?", "Call it \u201cFood for the Neurospicy\u201d, it is going to be awesome.\nFull disclosure: I am autistic and eat pretty much everything. We are all different, but a lot of us like bland, predictable foods. There is a lot of talk of \u201cbeige foods\u201d in neurodivergent circles.\n\nI like the idea, so NTA.\n\n\nPS: your daughter has meltdowns. She doesn\u2019t throw tantrums, they are meltdowns. It\u2019s different.\n\nAnd I think your wife might be struggling with the idea of having an autistic child, so once you get the diagnosis, touching base of going to therapy might help.\nBut good on you to get the kiddo assessed. I waited four decades for my diagnosis.", "NAH your wife is right you have to think of your margins. Also sensors issues aren't a normal dietary restriction, they are extremely unique to the individual. So you aren't really making an Autism friendly menu, you are making a menu for your daughter.\n\nJust an idea consider offering things that are common safe foods based on what you already have on your menu so you aren't spending money on items you may not sell. Like a butter noodle dish or even a make your own pasta. Then put a statement on your menu saying something like \n\n\"We do our best to be a sensory issues friendly restaurant. Please ask your server about changes to your dish and we will do our best to accommodate.\"\n\nThis way you are letting people know it is a safe space where they won't be judged for asking for something different.", "NTA \n\nI mean I can see where you\u2019re coming from, your heart is in the right place but not every autistic person is alike. Just because one person likes something or doesn\u2019t like something  doesn\u2019t mean everyone is like that. You can offer that stuff on the regular menu and avoid labeling it autism friendly, it\u2019d just be more options for everyone. Try adding a message or something that says you can take or add things for sensory or dietary restrictions", "NTA for wanting to do it, but I'm pretty sure people with ASS have as varied a taste palate as NT people. I know several people with ASS who don't have any issues with food whatsoever. Their sensory sensitivities are linked to clothing or sound, for example. So I think you're missing the ball even though I get why you'd want to do it.", "NAH, but if I can give a few bits of feedback as someone with autism and food issues myself - most people with autism don't necessarily have food sensitivity, so some people could take it as insensitively suggesting that all autistic people struggle with food.\n\nAlso, for the people that do have difficulties with it, the range of requirements is so incredibly varied that you'll never be able to create a menu that satisfies everyone. For example, you have mixed veggies on your autism friendly menu, but for me that's one of the things I struggle with most - I can only have vegetables in the form of a smoothie or soup. And none of the other options you list would appeal to me much, either, for me personally they'd be things that I'd think \"fine, I'll have this so I don't go hungry, if it's the only thing on the menu I can take\"\n\nFinally, and I don't think this point has been mentioned in any of the other posts but I think it's an important one: having it as a separate menu could draw (often unwelcome) attention to it, for people with milder autism who want to be able to enjoy relatively normal social situations with friends or family. Honestly, although you clearly mean well with it, if I ever went to a restaurant where I found myself using the phrase \"can I look at the autistic menu?\" I would never want to go back there. I would much prefer to order something from the normal menu and ask for it without the bits I don't like, or eat around them.\n\nTl;dr: I think it's nice that you're trying to find new ways to be inclusive, but this one - IMO - needs a bit of work in order to be practical and let people take advantage of it without feeling self conscious", "NAH, but I think you will find it\u2019s not so easy.\n\nMy nephew for instance, would eat raw spaghetti out of the box, and tomatoes.  And those get eaten like an apple.  Every single person will have their own quirks.  Your kid might like cukes sliced, but someone else only eats them in skewer form.  \n\nYou could try offering \u2018basics\u2019 instead.  Pasta, with option to add butter, cheese, olive oil, etc.  plain grilled chicken breast.  Unseasoned veggies.  That way it\u2019s marketed to all food issues( allergies, textures, taste, your average three year old going through a phase,  etc ) instead of focusing on autism", "Maybe sensory friendly", "NTA I would love somewhere like that in my town", "NTA. I don\u2019t think a separate menu is a good idea though. Just add to your original menu. You can even offer the veggies sliced different ways to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs. Maybe offer a charcuterie board type thing with different options as well.", "NTA but it\u2019s just inappropriate. Maybe have a statement about specialized food preferences on the menu, indicating a willingness to prepare something special. But if you try to design a menu around \u201cautistic\u201d preferences, it will be never ending. People w ASD are just people with different likes and dislikes.", "Y W B T A only for the name, though the sentiment is very sweet! I would go with something like \"Sensory friendly foods\" maybe? Something a little broader and gentler, as all sorts of people have \"safe\" foods", "I absolutely love this post! Your intentions are soo good!  \n\nOh, if your child is this limited with her food from a very early stage, most of the time it is not only autism... but ARFID as well. \n\nI love the passion that you want to an ASS friendly enviroment, but it wont work. Every autist is different and a lot of them are very specific where it comes to food. One only eats veggies, the other will only drink milk and doesnt like food at all, other have every fastfood, or Pasta Pancakes Patat (fries) and Poffertjes (dont know the English word for it... \n\nBut if it haunts you and you really want to make a difference... organize a cooking club for children (maybe with their parents, extra eyes are always nice) on the spectrum. Explain not only what to cook, but also its benefits and how much a body needs for xx to function properly.", "I'm autistic and honestly I would not go to a restraunt that has the word autistic anything on the menu. I am a human being and would like to be treated as such, so I side with your wife on this.", "Your heart's in the right place but that's not really feasible. An autism menu is a bad idea, period.", "NTA but maybe compromise and post notice that you are willing to accommodate sensitive eaters? That way people can order what they need to should it come up.", "Rather than have a fixed Autism menu I would suggest adding  a line that you are willing to prepare special items for Autistic patrons. Much like you might add Gluten friendly and Vegan choices are available. When someone comes in and asks about those options the chef, you, would go to the table and discuss the needs of the patron and what you can prepare.\n\nYour daughter may not like her tomatoes quartered but another person may only like them if they are quartered. By speaking directly with the customer you can find out what they need.", "NTA but I don't think you necessarily need a separate menu. Just be accommodating to your customers.", "NAH\n\nInstead of calling it an \"Autism Friendly\" side-menu, just add it as an A-la Carte section of the menu. No one can get offended by that, and you might get a few extra bucks on sales as other customers enhance their meals from there.\n\nYour wife is mildly an ass for saying potential customers should just eat elsewhere. Not a very supportive thing to say...", "NAH Sounds good but absolutely don't have it's name reference Autism.", "I think this is an extremely lovely idea. I can't speak to the cost efficiency in any professional way but surely it would be cheaper? Plain pasta is not exactly expensive. You'll already have pasta. And you'll charge appropriately for it. I honestly can't imagine it would expensive to implement this. Even if no one takes you up on it. \n\nI have a friend who grew up in a family of people with coeliac disease. He didn't have it but his tastes were decidedly plain because of his household. He couldn't eat out anywhere. It's very good of you to consider people like your daughter. But the truth is, food issues affect a variety of people. I think this is a very nice gesture and I bet your daughter would love the idea.", "NTA. It's a misguided attempt though. Just scatter her foods through the menu. Usually \"autistic\" diet would be very bland, beige foods. Tomato for example is not a favoured food by most autistic people I know (myself, my son, our community). We tend to like foods that taste the same every time, no surprises, so fresh fruit and vege usually isn't there because some of X fruit is sweet some times, sour some times, mealy sometimes, juicy some times, it's unpredictable. What's friendly for one autistic isn't for another. So again, sweet idea but I just don't see it working out and I also think some autistic people might be actually offended by seeing that on a menu, like they've been pigeonholed because of a diagnosis.", "Nta- you have a big heart, and it sounds strange to have that menu- buuuut also really sweet of you. But also I\u2019m not really sure \u201cAutism friendly\u201d is how I would describe it. Maybe just off these things as side dishes/extras. Because there are so many types of Autistic people and many have zero interest in those foods", "I think you could just rebrand it sensory friendly or even offer special requests depending on individual\u2019s dietary needs. Kinda like Burger Kings have it your way ideal.", "I personally don\u2019t see a reason to add \u201cautism friendly\u201d food to an already minimal menu.. I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH for wanting to do that.\n\nDespite the fact that not all autistic people have the same food preferences. I work with an autistic child who will only eat chicken. I\u2019ve worked with autistic kids that only want items that are plain with no sauce. Every kid is different.", "i'd just put something under the entree's or kid's menu sections like:\n\n\\*\\* for special considerations, ask your server \\*\\*\n\nand then advise your cooks of this policy regarding catering to such requests.", "With I think NTA, I still don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll work as not all people with autism have the same food proclivities.  The first time you have an Autistic diner that won\u2019t eat anything on that side menu, you\u2019ll get some irate parent cussing you out.  It\u2019s a sweet gesture (I love someone with autism), but the disorder is so widely varied, that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good plan.", "NTA however please revisit this idea. You're coming up with an 'autism friendly' menu based on one child's needs. Not all autistic people are going to have the same aversions and what works for her doesn't work for others.\n\nIt may be best to put a little note on your menu that if a customer has particular dietary needs to speak to their waiter and you will try and accommodate them. That way, you're not generalising and you're not restricting it to autistic people.", "NAH but you definitely need to take some more time to think it through and incorporate it in a way that doesn't feel demeaning.", "NTA but it\u2019s a bad idea. There is a reason it\u2019s called the autism spectrum, because everyone with autism is different. Instead just put a note on your menu that you are autism friendly and happy to adapt dishes to accommodate sensory issues with food.", "NTA \n\nI think this is a brilliant idea. \n\nThere are lots of people around with a family member on the spectrum. \n\nThis would make them feel welcome. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to put it on the main menu. Just a simply comment to request it would be perfect. \n\nWork of mouth would get around pretty fast anyway! \n\nWith such a small seating amount the noise would be lower as well. \n\nThis could work perfectly. \n\nAnd being inclusive is always a good thing", "Nta. I get the thought but you need  to figure out a way to be flexible.  My son who does not have autism would love a plate if cucumbers.  And i have at places when we have ordered salad asked for a side of cucumber ( i will pay) . I do wish places offered small servings of all of there meals if possible. Like a Demi or something. Many kids do not like the normal kids fair. And my son who is now 9 doesn\u2019t like that  and i don\u2019t want to pay for a huge adult meal. Our solution is often on parent get a meal to share with child and a extra side  .", "Add \u201cmenu substitutions and sensory friendly options available upon request\u201d to the main menu.\n\nNAH \n\nYour heart is in the right place but it\u2019s not going to bring in business. My sister has AFRID and can\u2019t eat a lot of foods for sensory reasons. But her restrictions are not the same as our cousin who is autistic. There are few foods they actually have in common\u2026 it\u2019s not going to add profit or make people with sensory issues feel more included (since the set list of sensory foods might not be their foods.) \n\nMaybe make a special with your daughter\u2019s name. Every day write a meal that she would eat. Or inspired by her.", "Aside from agreeing with the \"don't make an autism menue that would only cater to one specific child, make one with create-your-own-dish or other ways of being open to amendments....\n\nYou seem to be glossing over or missing the fact that your wife is worried about your finances; either the finances for your family or for the restaurant...because she worries enough about the slim margins to not want to even consider something that might alienate the larger customer base. \n\nYou probably need to talk to her about this, because while it is a passion project for you it is also an investment that both of you have made, and she may be more reliant on it (emotionally or financially, now or for the future) than you realise. She is risk avoidant here for a reason - you need to get on each others page before fighting for your own side.\n\nNAH.", "NAH, but dude, just put those options on your everyday menu. there is no need for an extra disclaimer, and it wouldn't be accurate because not all autistic people have the same sensory issues. One may have issues with their food touching, one may only eat crunchy things, the next may only eat soft things. \n\nAnd then there are people with ARFID or other problems, who are *not* autistic but still would appreciate having some simple options. \n\nJust put it on the menu, let everyone pick from it whatever they want, everybody's happy.", "Autistic person here. NAH. Your heart is in the right place. Please consult with a reputable group for people with Autism, such as ASAN. In the end it might be safer to simply offer customization.", "NTA bc your heart is in the right place. But I would call it \" piccoli morsi\". Italian for little bites. And include an varied amount of fruit/veggie/pasta sides  that can be customized . Like a pick 3 little bites etc. Ykwim?", "NAH\n\nTo me it seems like both of your hearts are in the right place despite the disagreement so it\u2019s hard to label you or your wife as an AH.\n\nI hope I\u2019m not being an AH by making this suggestion, but perhaps a compromise would be for the menu to say, \u201cwe are happy to provide sensory-mindful dining accommodations\u201d or something similar. Keep in mind that everyone is different, so a strict set menu of sensory-mindful dishes might welcome some but exclude others.\n\nIf you and your staff are serious about this, the best approach may be to try to work with customer needs on an individual level, but to let it be known on the menu that you can make some adjustments if needed for sensory reasons.", "Not a bad idea.

They all have different things they enjoy or completely sends them over the edge. My child dese not eat sour cream, cream cheese, ranch, butter that they can see if it\u2019s mixed in cool but otherwise it is a hard no. \n\nIf you want to do something to show that you are trying to include the ASD community maybe put a few of the ASD puzzle pieces on the menu but the reality of the situation is that it is not realistic and you will tank your business by trying to cater to such a small diverse demographic.", "I work with autistic kids and so many have intolerances in regards to food but honestly they\u2019re so different that it\u2019s so difficult to determine a list of autism friendly foods for all tbh. It really varies so much so I\u2019m not sure if it would work", "NTA.\n\nIs this something that could be adapted to a kids menu, which are usually less complicated?

I think it\u2019s lovely that you want to make your restaurant inviting for people who struggle with sensory overload rather than a stressful ordeal. The main issues a lot of us have are noise and light though. Loud, with bright lighting? Torture. \nI\u2019d ask your doctor to point you in the direction of quality sources of info on autism, any local parent groups, and online communities. Beware, there are some cesspits out there.", "not every autistic person is alike. Making such a menu comes off as very rude and judgemental to me.  \nI have a family member with autism, they eat like everyone else. Sure there's a texture here and there that is offputting but that's it. No plain pasta or crackers.  \nYour wife is right too, you're making a menu fit for a picky toddler.  \nI  won't say y t a cause you have good intentions. But this is not a good idea.

Your heart is in the right place, and it\u2018s a sweet thought. But autistic people are not a monolith and their food preferences will not be the same.

As plenty of people here have pointed out, food preferences vary wildly among people on the spectrum. \n\nBut, your heart is certainly in the right place, and I think with some tweaking, you could have a valuable idea come out of this. For example, one day a month, you have a \u2018sensory friendly\u2019 dinner where people can either call ahead with their child\u2019s preferences, or you allow the parents to bring their child\u2019s preferences with them. \n\nParents of children with ASD so rarely get to enjoy a meal out if their child has preferences that a restaurant can\u2019t usually accommodate.

My son is autistic, and he's less picky than my non-autistic son, although he does have food sensitivities which are independent of his autism.  And he won't eat cukes or tomatoes (it's buttered noodles or something with Alfredo sauce when we do Italian).\n\nHonestly if I saw an \"autism menu\" I would immediately think \"man this restaurant doesn't know anything about autism.\"\n\nSo you aren't addressing autistic kids, and thus that's a bad business choice and your wife is right.\n\nNAH.

Better to put a line on the menu \"special requests are welcome\" so people can order plain pasta or chicken breast plain and  not feel singled out by a menu labeled for autism.", "Like a lot of others, I agree that you should probably just focus on/highlight the fact that you are happy to alter/accommodate those with food sensitivities or allergies etc. My son is on the autism spectrum and has certain sensory sensitivities around food and I always worry that I\u2019m being a bother when I have to say \u201cno sauce on that, thanks\u201d, \u201ccan you just put that on the side?\u201d and \u201cno topping on the ice cream, just plain please\u201d. I would definitely love a restaurant that was happily willing to cater to his needs and would definitely promoted it amongst my family and friends.", "NTA, but there is no need to have a separate section of the menu. Just state that you can cater to sensory/dietary needs, or you can have a \"create your own\" section of the menu with a list of pastas, sauces (and maybe plain/butter/cheese options), and proteins. This could help other people with specific needs as well.", "NAH but I kinda agree with your wife. I think it will turn more ppl off than you think. I mean, your daughter is one person...

Please let your server know about any dietary restrictions or sensory preferences so that we can provide alternative options and substitutions that fit the needs of each member in your party.\u201d \n\nAnd then maybe have the server mention it when greeting the table as well so it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s encouraged and not an annoyance to request changes to the listed items. \n\nCould also have a list of available proteins/veggies/starches etc at the end of the menu with a note that any dish can be made with customers desired substitutions", "NTA. It's a very lovely idea. However I wouldn't specifically called it \"autism-friendly\", there it can be stigmatizing. People with autism also have very different personalities and preferences. My brother ate the same food for a long time, but what your daughter likes to eat, he doesn't like at all.", "How is this different from a kids menu?", "NTA for wanting to be accommodating, but maybe slightly TA if you assign a specific diagnosis to part of the menu.

Your intentions are there. As others have said, other autistic kids will have different tastes than your child and there are other reasons that kids may be picky eaters.  Instead of creating a menu for autistic kids, make a menu for picky eaters - something like a traditional kids menu, but more flexible in portion sizes, preparations, and substitutions.

This is beside the point but our margins are slim because it's moreso a passion of mine to cook rather than for any monetary gain. I retired a decade ago pretty young so this has been my hobby and focus.\n\nWe also have a particular daughter who we're awaiting for an appointment to verify she is on the spectrum but she has tells already that make us and our pediatrician believe so. The big thing is particularity about food. For example, her diet is 90% cucumbers, crackers, cheese, and tomatoes, and it needs to be prepared a certain way. Like if her tomatoes are quartered, she will throw a tantrum.\n\nI broached to my wife the idea of a small side menu of, and I'm not sure how best to describe it without offense, \"Autism friendly\" appetizers and entrees. Things like mixed veggies and crackers, plain pasta with cheese, and so on. I'm developing it with my daughter in mind, so I'm basing it on her food preferences. It's still a work in progress but I'm also talking to some of our couple friends who have children on the spectrum for ideas.\n\nMy wife says it's infantilizing to have something like that on our menu and that I'm trying to appeal to a tiny tiny demographic despite our slim margins. She, instead, said that if people are not happy with our offerings they should eat elsewhere. It breaks my heart a little because I'm doing this for my daughter and other children like her, and to my mind, it incentivizes more customers, so in fact, it would maybe generate extra revenue.\n\nWe jointly own the property and have jointly come up with our menues, so we're at a standstill. I will very likely need to drop the topic and things go on as usual. I want to refer to this sub, however, and possibly take some of the comments here and push harder.

Your heart is in the right place for wanting to provide an accommodation but you need to do it in a less over generalized way. Just because your daughter likes a food that was does not mean that any other person with Autism would. You are generalizing an entire population. (And yes, infantilizing as there are lots of adults with Autism.) Perhaps a better way to go about it would be to put something on there that states you would be willing to adapt meals to be preference friendly to those with Autism.", "NTA. Maybe the name is a little harsh, but if this menu is SUPER customizable then I think it\u2019s a wonderful step.", "YTA.  There's no such thing, no diet that would be OK for everyone on the spectrum.

As a former restaurant owner and lifelong restaurant worker I think what you\u2019re trying to do is nice but you\u2019re wife is right that it\u2019s limited in scope to who you\u2019re going to reach with it because, not every person on the spectrum has the same food aversions. I think it would be better to put a little blurb on the menu that says you allow and will work with folks who have food aversions/dietary restrictions to make something they will enjoy.", "NAH but every autistic person can have vastly different safe foods. This menu will not accomplish what you want it to accomplish.\n\nRather, additional information about being able to modify dishes for sensory issues as a quick note in your menu could be helpful. \n\nCrackers and cheese could be an easily added bit to your appetizer menu. Veggies that you use for other dishes could be put on the appetizer menu also. I would avoid adding vegetables that you don\u2019t already use as they are often very perishable and may not be popular- I\u2019m thinking cucumbers in particular.\n\nCreating a whole separate menu for autistics will not work. Heck, my safe food is curry and I\u2019m allergic to half of what you mentioned for it. I understand the sentiment, but you can accomplish your goal of inclusion much more readily by adding in the note about being able to make accommodations for sensory issues", "NTA, I think its a nice idea but we don't all like the same foods. Safe foods vary from autistic person to autistic person and get more complicated if they also have ARFID, but I understand the reasoning behind it and I appreciate that you're actually wanting to put a little side menu like that together.\n\nI will note, calling her reaction to her tomatoes not being right a \"tantrum\" isn't the most accurate term and most of us would refer to it as a \"meltdown\".", "Yes lol. Autistic pple are still pple you know. They arnt a hybrid or different species", "NTA - but it is important to carefully consider the name. Your heart is certainly in the right place, but I like what other commenters have suggested about calling it either a more broad \u201cSensory Friendly Menu\u201d or naming it after your daughter. I even like the idea of a very broad statement on the menu saying something about how substitutions and accommodations can be made because your restaurant is dedicated to creating a welcome environment to all.", "NTA But what about instead saying something like \"Sensory Friendly Menu Items\" and including a range of things that people who are particularly sensory-sensitive might want to eat? Like plain noodles etc etc. \nYou could also include language such as \"We will do our best to accommodate any dietary or sensory restrictions. Please let us know if we can modify or adapt items to meet your needs.\"\nI have an autistic child and she basically eats everything. I would feel more welcome in an environment where I knew people were trying to be accommodating, however our needs would include wheelchair access, accessible washrooms, and use of AAC etc, not special menu items.

Not saying talking to parents is bad, but that autistic voices are important and should be consulted for anything autism related.", "YWBTA if you push this as is. Your menu is basically an autistic _child\u2019s_ menu. Not one for adults or teens. Additionally, your menu is entirely tailored to your very young kid, the only autistic person in your life clearly - if you knew more older autistic people and people who worked with them, you\u2019d have better sense to realise your motives are pure but deeply misguided and clumsy (since, you know, they\u2019d be able to communicate that with you).\n\nAlso? Your kid will grow up. Chances are she may get used to some things and/or develop new aversions as she grows and experiences more foods, especially if she\u2019s not high needs and incapable of functioning without strict supervision - she\u2019s going to be curious and experiment and learn and what good is that menu once she\u2019s 10, 15, 20?\n\nSo your wife is right.

My sibling had a similar issue when it came to all of us eating out. It always resulted in my mom having to make and bring food from home to hopefully be warmed up by the restaurant, which they almost always gave her a hard time about if they even did it all. I think it would be incredibly inclusive to have a restaurant where we could have all gone and been treated the same. All of our food comes out at the same time on plates. We could all order from the menu. That would have made everyone feel included. I agree on a name change, but maybe consult with a dietitian to figure out some of the general dietary needs or themes of people who have restrictions. \n\nI can\u2019t for the life of me remember where I saw this on a menu, but I went to a restaurant once that had menu items for people who had undergone bariatric surgery.

They were all normal menu items, you didn\u2019t have to ask for the item in a bariatric portion or anything. But they were automatically built to be the right portion size and provide you with an appropriate caloric and vitamin level for post operation patients. And the price reflected the smaller portion size.", "NTA. I think it's an interesting idea, but with your limited capacity and margins already under pressure, perhaps you could test it? For example, you could do an autisim-friendly week or month, asking feedback from customers, and maybe some local social media and press coverage, then review?", "NTA but maybe tweak your idea.

One of the most frustrating things for me when I'm ordering food is having nothing more than a name and a few vague descriptors like \"hearty\" or \"delicious\" to go off of, and it also can be *really* frustrating when ingredients are listed incompletely - for example, finding out that all burritos from a certain restaurant contain copious amounts of avocado (which has a texture I find highly unpleasant) really sucked. \n\nSecond, be open to modifications that may be requested - if you accept online orders (which you really, really should), that includes them as well. \n\nThird, as I mentioned earlier, *accept online orders.* Probably 80% of the meals I get from restaurants are takeout (and occasionally delivery), and that's not a commentary on the effort a restaurant puts into their dining room, it's just that a lot of features of dine-in restaurants are inherently stressful (that and most of the time I order food, it's because I'm too busy to cook and don't have anything prepared, so going to a restaurant to have a sit-down meal just isn't feasible). \n\nAs a final note, I'm not sure how any of this is going to repel other customers, so while you may be catering to a (relatively) small demographic, it's not like you're *only* catering to us, and I doubt autistic people are the only ones who would appreciate the things I listed above either. Also, it's worth pointing out that due in large part to autism \"charities\" often having very different priorities than autistic people, terminology is going to be very important here - \"autism friendly\" could be taken at face value, or it could be taken as a bit of a red flag.

Sometimes restaurants feel the need to make it stupidly unclear what you're ordering, making the picture super small or not visible, not listing toppings or ingredients or giving a clear indication of whether sides or ON or BESIDES the meal (For me touching is very much a no-no for meals) \n\nYou guys could both improve on your inclusivity but it's definitely a step in the right direction OP!", "NAH. I'm autistic and will piggy back some of the other comments saying to just put it on the menu that you're willing to adjust based off dietary and sensory preferences. Everyone has different sensory experiences. I, for one,  HATE cucumber, the texture gives me the willies. \n\nI think it's commendable you want to do something like this. But you would be TA if you don't take these suggestions to heart.", "YWBTA only because the name is misleading as there likely aren't general preferences among picky eaters on the spectrum. \n\nIf you're developing a portion of your menu for your daughter I would heavily advise against naming it along the lines of \"autism friendly\". Not sure what that even means anyways as I would imagine they would have unique preferences.  \n\nInstead I would echo others and say you should make it known that you are \"picky eater\" friendly by advertising that strict dietary needs and heavy modifications are welcomed. You should be able to be creative in naming your side menu (maybe even after your daughter) and adding to the description the advert mentioned above. \n\nI think that would be a sweet thing to do for your daughter, give you -- or your servers -- a story to tell about your inspiration; and it would be presented in a way that all guests could connect with it but especially those who are parents to children with autism.", "You are the opposite of YTA, this is a great idea.\n\nIt would signal to people that you understand other needs and are willing to make adjustments. I would keep it small, people will understand that you can modify things like make noodles with no sauce.\n\nMaybe add two or three items that are simple just to signify the option.", "As an autistic person, I struggled as a child with food options on menus. It made it hard on my parents to take me to dinner with them. I think this is delightful and the food you\u2019re talking about offering are things you already offer, just simplified. Maybe you could frame it that way? And maybe be more inclusive than just Autism for the menu title. I\u2019m not sure how you would title that but many children are picky eaters either for sensory issues or otherwise. I appreciate that you\u2019re going out of your way for folks like us. It makes a difference.", "NTA. But there are a lot of people out there. That get called picky eaters not just the autistic that might like it. Sounds like a selling point that's worth a try.", "I\u2019d call it an \u201cfood sensitivity friendly menu\u201d, and I\u2019d create little checkbox form that people can fill out. \n\nInstead of assuming pasta with cheese, for example, put a list of carb bases and a list of simple toppings. \u201cPick one base, pick up to 3 toppings\u201d. Have an area for writing any other specific instructions where they can put something like \u201cdon\u2019t bake the cheese\u201d. You could even have cost added extras like meats, bread sides, whatever. \n\nHave a list of common allergies and a space to write other (if you\u2019re willing to do this that is, which is much more complicated than sensory and you also need to make it clear that these ingredients are used in the same kitchen and potential for cross contamination exists). \n\nI know at 3 people that would kill to have a restaurant this accommodating near us. Only one is on the autism spectrum, that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t make it specific to autism friendly. \n\nYou could perfect your check list and get cute like tear off pads to leave on the tables with those tiny golf pencils.

I\u2019d also take a cute picture (or get someone with good Instagram level photography skills) of the little cards and then post it to your local Facebook/online groups that might be interested. like if you find an autism support page post the pic and explain that you created this menu with your daughter in mind and welcome anyone with food sensory sensitivities like her to your restaurant.", "I don\u2019t love the idea of an \u201cautism friendly menu\u201d because that kinda just ignores that people with autism are individuals with their own sense of taste but what about a \u2018simple menu\u2019 or a \u2018sensory friendly menu\u2019 or just letting people know you\u2019re happy to adapt", "NTA but I'd label it \"sensory friendly\", just to be respectful and cover a wider range of patrons.", "I agree with the other comments to offer substitutions. Everyone on the spectrum has different preferences. Some only eat meat, some can't.

Let it be known that you are open to accomodating diverse dietary needs instead of using terminology that may be offensive to some customers. What OP is proposing would only get him and his restaurant dragged on social media.", "This here.  You can be more inclusive with this approach.", "This would be amazing for myself and my partner who is on the spectrum and has ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). Basically anything that his body doesn't recognize as \"food\" gives him an involuntary reaction similar to what happens if I accidentally drink milk that's gone off. It really limits where we can go eat together and keeps us in the same places often. He's looked into therapy/treatment but currently the cost is prohibitive while he works on some other health concerns. He'll get there eventually since he's tired of eating the same foods over and over.", "Seconding this as someone who\u2019s autistic, it\u2019s a nice idea OP has but everyone has vastly different sensory needs so it would be impossible to come up with one unified menu.

I wouldn't offer anything specific because each person is different with their food needs and sensory issues.", "Yes. The thing is not everyone who experiences food related tendencies with ASD have the same tendencies. Having a whole ass side menu catered with one particular person's preferences in mind could backfire badly and paint OP as ignorant. And while I don't agree with the wife's attitude behind her reasoning that neurodivergent people need to just deal or go elsewhere, I do not believe that lowering the bar of society in general makes it easier for them to deal with having to live in it, it just makes expectations uneven and causes unnecessary stress to those having to deal with things being inconsistent. \n\nFor sure add a note to the menu about altering them, but I would design one and call it the autism menu.", "I have extreme sensory/texture issues with food. I\u2019ve also been diagnosed with ADHD since I was around 10. I totally get what you\u2019re trying to do. As an adult, I\u2019m constantly terrified of new places but luckily everywhere has a salad. I think a better solution would be \u201csensory sensitive\u201d little panel on your menu that lists the basic options that can be arranged in a way to please the guests youre targeting, of course using items you already have in the store for other dishes. Think like a build your own pizza list almost. But you list the noodle types, sauces, toppings, and vegetables and then guests can order from that if necessary. Or even on a separate little handout that can be provided if requested.", "Oh yes, this is the way to word it! Make it some nice font that stands out and put it on the menus even", "Yeah exactly, half his menu sounds like it would be the worst sensory wise for me.

A lot of people with autism feel self conscious when ordering at restaurants as it is because they have sensory issues and are hesitant to ask. \n\nIf you have that posted on the menu, and they know they can ask without being looked at as weird or being a bother, that would be so much more inclusive. \n\nMy son has ASD and I know that when he was a kiddo, we tended to frequent places we knew he could get his meal the way he wanted it without it being a big deal to the place we were eating at. \n\nNow as an adult, he tells me all the time that he doesn't order his food a certain way because he doesn't want to be a bother or he doesn't want to have the server look at him funny.", "To add on to this, why not just include the aforementioned \u201cAutism Friendly\u201d options into the regular menu, no mention of Autism or anything like that.

Same with autism.", "Exactly his heart in his the right place he just need some guidance to make it work", "I'm autistic and would not eat any of those things as a child. I was an extremely picky eater. It would be nice to have options for regular meals. I'm not a vegetarian but can't eat meat in things like spaghetti and lasagna. Cheese-only versions would be nice. I would be turned off if they call it \"autistic friendly\" with a bunch of kid-type meals. Autistic adults exist.", "I think what OP describes is somewhat similar to what menu restaurants consider the \u201cchildren\u2019s menu\u201d, which usually consists of very simple, plain foods that most picky children would be fine with. OP, I suggest you have a children\u2019s section in your menu instead, with a little note there that you\u2019re also open to requests if the little one has very specific preferences, as long as you have the ingredients on hand.\n\nI would think however that if I had a kid with such basic and selective eating habits, something like just crackers and tomatoes, I\u2019d had fed her before coming or just bring her crackers with me and speak to the staff to inform them about the child\u2019s situation.", "I agree with this. I have two autistic kids. One is a teenager and one is a young adult. They both love it when there are simpler options on the regular menu. No having to disclose that they are autistic to get the restaurant to let them order from the kids menu, no ordering a meal just to discover that even though the menu didn\u2019t say the pasta had sun dried tomatoes in it, there are red flecks in their white sauce, making it inedible. Just simple options, right there with all the other food.", "Yes, a \"build your own\" pasta menu would cover all the bases. Pick your type of pasta, pick your toppings, if you want anything on the side let the server know. My son is weird about pasta sauce and likes it on the side so he can use it more like a dip than a topping. Could do the same with pizza, salads.", "I wouldn\u2019t do this unless she could properly consent to it (I\u2019m assuming she is a young child). Food sensitivities can be incredibly embarrassing for a person, and naming it after her would be advertising exactly what her problems are.\n\nEven if people aren\u2019t mean about it, often times people would like their privacy anyway.", "Yes love this, \u201cSarah\u2019s menu (for ages 0 to 100)\u201d or something, because it might be assumed as a \u201ckids menu\u201d by many patrons and making sure it\u2019s known that anyone can order from it might help make people more comfortable", "This is a great suggestion.", "This is what I was thinking too!

Even if they don't say \"no substitutions,\" which is not by any means limited to bougie or hipster places, they might only be willing to allow small, easy substitutions.

Please ask your server.\u201d", "Or maybe \"we will do our best to customize menu items to meet dietary or sensory issues wherever possible\"? That way you're promising to try, not necessarily deliver, and not saying every dish is 100% customizable, since there's not much you can do about a pre-made big batch food like lasagna.", "It\u2019s shocking how many restaurants REFUSE to altar an item in any way.

He once had a panic attack because he started feeling sick after sitting to eat and couldn't stomach to finish the food - at home!\n\nHubby was raised the same way, but has no food related trauma. For him, it's curfew related BS that still get him nervous at age 31.

I think OP's heart is in the right place. He just needs to add in a little business saviness to go with it.

Then it was like every meal I was served had mayonnaise in it, as if trying to starve me until I gave in.  (My family was well aware of my dislike for the substance.)  This caused me to be a binge eater later on, something I still mildly struggle with (especially after grocery store trips).  I will also immediately start to cry (tear up mostly, no boohoos or anything) if I taste a food and dislike the flavor.
