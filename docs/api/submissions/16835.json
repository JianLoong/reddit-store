{"id": 16835, "submission_id": "13d2r6k", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my sis the hotel room key?", "selftext": "Apologies for format and whatever, I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nTo get straight to it me (22F) and my sister (27?F) are on vacation at a popular theme park that has hotels you can stay at to have early entry, etc. She paid for this trip as a birthday gift to me and while I\u2019m very grateful for that, I knew it came with strings. \n\nFirst, she pushed me over and over to buy things I can\u2019t afford. Drinks, food, souvenirs, add ons, tshirts, etc. I\u2019m a poor graduate student and finally had to put my foot down about purchasing things, which made her pouty/upset at me multiple times. I shrugged this off as she had paid for my trip. Then she made me the pack mule for all of our days at the park\u2014I carried all our IDs, cards, tickets, and anything we bought. This would be fine if she wasn\u2019t demanding I get things out at the speed of light and then groping me to open up the fanny pack strapped across my chest if I wasn\u2019t fast enough. She snapped at me over this multiple times. On top of that, I was expected to only do the rides/attractions she was interested in. Otherwise I\u2019d have to ride alone, which would also be fine if she didn\u2019t become passive aggressive about having to wait for me. In the end, I just went along with her because she did pay for everything and I\u2019m not uber into the themes of the park, it wasn\u2019t a huge deal to me not to choose things. \n\nBut this all came to a head about an hour ago. I got off a ride she hadn\u2019t wanted to get on and met her in one of the bars/restaurants. We decided to go on a specific ride, but since she had just finished her beer she wanted to sit for a minute. She was wishy washy about what she wanted to do during this break, changing the plan a few times. I said okay to the first two ideas, but after the third, I (admittedly) did get whiny about not wanting to walk halfway across the park to the other place she wanted to go. She snapped at me and asked what I wanted to do. I replied that I wanted to ride the roller coaster we talked about at the beginning, but not if she was going to act bratty about it. \n\nThis set her off and she went on a rant about how she paid for the trip and that I needed to calm down. I responded that we\u2019ve been doing whatever she wanted for the past two days, which made her angry. She decided to leave me alone in the park (this is my first time here) but not before chasing me down the street to get her ID and credit card from me. I gave her the ID when she demanded I give her the room key for the hotel. I said she could have her ID and cards, but that I was keeping the room key. It\u2019s the only one we have and you need it to do certain things in the park. She demanded it and kept following me until I told her to f*** off and threw her card on the ground. This is where I\u2019m probably the asshole.\n\nAnyway, after that she finally left me alone and eventually she went back to our hotel, leaving me in the park alone. I\u2019m planning on spending the remainder of the day doing the things I actually wanted to do.

Why is she demanding you do whatever she wants if its YOUR birthday?", "NTA...It sounds like your sister bought a gift for herself and pretended it was for you so she'd have an obedient companion.  Enjoy yourself if you can.", "Uhhhhhh, wtf! I literally just did this same thing. Took my mom to a theme park (I\u2019m thinking the same one you went to) as a present. I did not once hold it over her head, make her follow my plans, or be a general asshat like your sister was. The day was about US having fun! The way you handled it maybe wasn\u2019t ideal, but damn she was awful to you all day prior!\nNTA", "NTA, but you can fix this pretty easily.  First, get another hotel room key.  They will always give enough for each person staying to have one.  You should have given her the key when she asked and gotten your own key from the hotel.  If it is Universal (my guess), the hotel is close enough.  If it is Disney, it is associated with your account, and guest services can help you. She should carry a bag so she can keep her id and other essentials with her.\n\nYou can be alone in a theme park.  People go by themselves all the time.  You will have a great time this afternoon if you shake this off.    In the future, you two don't have to do everything together.  Let her do a ride while you do a different one or go shopping or take a break or whatever.  You can easily meet back up again.  Embrace your independence.\n\nFinally, if you are at Universal, they will hold your merchandise for you and even send it to the front of the park for you to pick up on your way out.  If this is anywhere else, just agree to buy stuff at the end of the day.  It helps with impulse purchases.  Don't feel bad about knowing your budget and refusing to buy stuff you don't want or need.", "NTA. She was generous with the gift but it seems to stop there. I'm not sure what she wants but it's clear she doesn't want the same things as you and leaves me wondering why she's even doing this particular thing with you.", "NTA, she brought you as a walking suit case. I wonder if she had to take you because no one else will travel with her anymore.  This was a gift to herself.", "I do hope this is a lesson learned. Sometimes free gifts do come at a price. NTA", "NTA and you should each have a key.", "NTA That sounds like a horrible trip. If she paid for everything, the front desk should be able to give her a new key if she has her ID and her name is on the reservation. You still needed to get back in the room later.", "NTA. You need to tell her that offering you a birthday trip does not mean she use it as a way to make you her slave. Your birthday, you should do what you want and not do her bidding. that is not the purpose of a FREAKING GIFT!!!", "ESH. It sounds like both of you need to learn how to communicate with one another better, and find some common ground to stand on.", "YTA.  \n\n>She paid for this trip as a birthday gift to me and while I\u2019m very grateful for that, I knew it came with strings. \n\nDon't accept gifts when you know they come with strings. Especially ones so extravagant.", "ESH, you were both acting bratty and spoiled.

She\u2019s been stealing our mom\u2019s credit card information and using it to pay for her flight upgrades to first class, streaming services, amazon purchases, etc. I\u2019m not all the way sure, but this park and hotel is expensive, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something she could afford on her own.

Thank you for your judgement!", "You realise accepting a gift that you ALSO think is from stolen money makes you a big AH, Right?", "That\u2019s a fair point, honestly. It\u2019s a complicated relationship between her and my mom, my mom and me, and me and her; I don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t get into it but in short, neither me nor my mom realized what was happening until yesterday, which was after our first day in the park and everything had been paid for."]}
