He's not an only child though, so good for you for ensuring there's enough to give all your children equal support.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right that he's an adult and you can't force him to make a different choice than the one he's made. Maybe it would be worth reminding him of how much you're still financially supporting him at his big age of 25 since children, barring extenuating circumstances, typically *start* gaining footing in their independence in their early 20's. Whereas he seems like he's not eager to make any steps towards that because he still presently expects you to keep providing for him and then some. I'm not suggesting stop paying for his college, but if you're giving him \"fun money\" allowances I think it's time to revoke that so he starts making up lost time in learning how to walk on his own two feet here. \n\nTbh, based on what you've described I'd be questioning if substance abuse is a part of this picture.", "NTA for not approving of the marriage, because he *asked* for your opinion. was your answer a bit harsh? yes, but it was also honest. is there a possibility sara is pressuring your son into marriage or has he always rushed things? either was 7 months is quite a short period to know someone", "NTA.
