He's not an only child though, so good for you for ensuring there's enough to give all your children equal support.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right that he's an adult and you can't force him to make a different choice than the one he's made. Maybe it would be worth reminding him of how much you're still financially supporting him at his big age of 25 since children, barring extenuating circumstances, typically *start* gaining footing in their independence in their early 20's. Whereas he seems like he's not eager to make any steps towards that because he still presently expects you to keep providing for him and then some. I'm not suggesting stop paying for his college, but if you're giving him \"fun money\" allowances I think it's time to revoke that so he starts making up lost time in learning how to walk on his own two feet here. \n\nTbh, based on what you've described I'd be questioning if substance abuse is a part of this picture.", "NTA for not approving of the marriage, because he *asked* for your opinion. was your answer a bit harsh? yes, but it was also honest. is there a possibility sara is pressuring your son into marriage or has he always rushed things? either was 7 months is quite a short period to know someone", "NTA.

Frankly she sounds like more of a catch than your son. Why are you saying they can\u2019t live with you ? Sarah owns her own apartment\u2026 unlike your son. Just be glad he found a woman naive enough to marry someone who can\u2019t cook or clean and lives with and is supported by their mom at 25.", "NTA. Sounds like you've provided a lot for OP, and you didn't forbid him from getting married, but you did lay out what would happen if he did so he can make an informed decision. I don't blame you a bit for not wanting young children around Sara based on your description of her. And if he's grown up enough to get married, he's grown up enough to live on his own and start paying his own way. He can't marry someone who acts that way and who you don't like and expect nothing to change. Every action has an outcome, and all of the things you said would change are very reasonable.", "INFO: Why doesn't your son know how to cook and clean?", "NTA", "NTA, sounds like 2 spoiled brats found each other and reality is going to knock the crap out of them.", "INFO: Am I understanding correctly - your son expects to live in your house after he's married? Or are you just telling him that that isn't an option?", "NTA\nYou had a completely frank conversation with him stating facts. I don\u2019t understand how anyone feels they should get married while living on the charity of others. It\u2019s one thing to fall on hard times after marriage and move in with parents for a while to save some money but if you can\u2019t afford your own home, you have no business getting married. \n\nThe fact that he choose to pout and sulk after hearing this is further evidence that he\u2019s too immature to be getting married. \n\nSome young people can\u2019t take advice, they just need to put their hands on the fire and get burnt. \n\nWell done for laying out things so clearly to him.", "NTA. You have valid reasons to not like her and he knows this. He wants you to ignore her poor treatment of his siblings and approve his marriage, and I assume was planning for you to pay for the wedding and possibly their lifestyle after the wedding.", "NTA", "He doesn't  want your approval,he wants your checkbook.NTA", "NTA", "NTA he is still living at home for free, still going to college and doesn\u2019t have stable employment? I\u2019d say he needs to grow the hell up. Marrying a 20 year old won\u2019t help with that either.", "Nta! He asked!  And expecting you to finance an expensive wedding?  No", "NTA. Also, you're so level-headed and pragmatic. Big ups for your rationality and (even sideline) support. I wish he could've inherited that from you.", "I\u2019d say OP was downright nice.  In my opinion adults don\u2019t get their parents to baby them any longer, if he\u2019s married he goes \u201cfull adult\u201d meaning he covers all his own expenses including college.  He needs to pay his own way in life\u2019s if he wants to be a grown up and get married.", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb this NTA your son is a grown man if he wants, to marry then it up to him to  be able to afford it. Same with after the wedding. He knows how you feel about the situation, but you aren\u2019t stopping him. They probably wanted his mom to pay for the wedding. I\u2019m guessing they either elope, have a long engagement or break up soon enough when they realize how hard being a grown up is op is NTA", "I can imagine this conversation going down.\n\nSon: It has been two whole months, don't you like my future wife now?\n\nOP: No.\n\nSon: But why?!\n\nOP: List of perfectly reasonable reasons.\n\nSon: *I'M OUT*", "exactly! he is acting entitled", "Especially when she has three younger children", "There\u2019s a reason he gets along with a 20yo so well", "Suck a duck?!?! \ud83d\ude33", "Why do you think he's going after a 19yo/20yo?", "This was my first thought. And signifies a failure on the part of the OP.", "My question as well.", "She lives rent feee because she owns her apartment as OP stated. Honestly, it\u2019s fairly common right now for a 25 year old to be at home-pandemic and inflation. That part should really be the least of the issues.", ">7 months is really early to marry and why hasn't he moved in with her if she has an apartment?\n\nBecause it's easier for both of them to sponge off his mommy.", "NTA she didn't say he couldn't. But she wouldn't support him or let his fianc\u00e9 be mean to her other kids. I wouldn't support his ass either", "Tried it. I am ashamed to say I stopped after he burned the 98th pan (I counted). In the end I decided to stop because it was burning a huge whole in my pocket. I wasn't hopping for his future wife to do it. I was hoping for a future with enough sense to help me make him learn because I learned it isn't something I can do on my own.", "He mentioned it during the talk.\n\n1. Free caretaker/housekeeper\n\nYou havent seen her apartment its like a dumpster. She won't clean it but will constantly complain.\n\n2) He thinks he's gonna inherit it because he's the oldest. So in his mind its already his. In reality its going to my youngest\n\n3) My house is located in a good neighborhood and is quite large", "Yes right. What I can't wrap.my head around is... what was this 25 yr old grown man imagining exactly? That he gets married and wifey just moves into his bedroom and together they mooch off of his mom? So he still wants to be a kid living under mom and dad's roof but wants a... wife?? I can't even laugh at this absurdity because I'm so worried about the future.", "Too nice by far.

As in, I've had severe burns from cooking accidents, and when I moved out I had to buy food I was okay eating burned because I either burned or undercooked things. My parents TRIED to teach me. For some reason things get weird when I'm in the kitchen. But I'm actually really good at pinpointing decent recipes.  \n\nThe exception is seafood. For some reason I am gifted with the ability to make fantastic scampi and Alfredo dishes. \n\nMy point being, my parents didn't fail, my grandmother rolls in her grave a lot, and I'm a parent in my thirties and can't cook. Of course, I married someone who can so the situations aren't similar.", "Plus he's still in college so it makes sense why he still lives at home.", "She's self-destructing her relationship with her son, and making sure his only emotional and financial support is with a woman who is still a child. \n\nHe's young, impulsive, and in \"true love.\" Shit's going to have to get real bad before he asks his mom for help about it.
