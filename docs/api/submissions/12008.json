He's not an only child though, so good for you for ensuring there's enough to give all your children equal support.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right that he's an adult and you can't force him to make a different choice than the one he's made. Maybe it would be worth reminding him of how much you're still financially supporting him at his big age of 25 since children, barring extenuating circumstances, typically *start* gaining footing in their independence in their early 20's. Whereas he seems like he's not eager to make any steps towards that because he still presently expects you to keep providing for him and then some. I'm not suggesting stop paying for his college, but if you're giving him \"fun money\" allowances I think it's time to revoke that so he starts making up lost time in learning how to walk on his own two feet here. \n\nTbh, based on what you've described I'd be questioning if substance abuse is a part of this picture.", "NTA for not approving of the marriage, because he *asked* for your opinion. was your answer a bit harsh? yes, but it was also honest. is there a possibility sara is pressuring your son into marriage or has he always rushed things? either was 7 months is quite a short period to know someone", "NTA.

In October,, he was stationed 875 miles away, so i saw him 2x.  Married in Feb.  At the courthouse, entire cost of wedding,  $40.00.  Had to live apart (875 miles) for 5 weeks after wedding.  Just celebrated our 46th wedding anniversary.  So, it was 7 months & very few in person visits.  We were 21.", "cough\u2026 \ud83d\ude02", "No, read it again.\n\nOP says she said multiple things to him (not liking Sara, thinking they should have a prenup, etc...  ending the conversation with the fact that she wouldn't help with a wedding) and he was upset and left.\n\nWe have no idea which thing actually upset him.  She has said in comments that she wants them to have a prenup because she thinks her son is a leach who will ruin Sara's life (and presumably try to take some of her money, or half her apartment, or whatever)...\n\nif my mother told me that, I wouldn't even hear what else she had to say, I would leave upset too.  OP doesn't actually say her son asked for her to pay for the wedding...  she doesn't say THAT's why he's upset.\n\nShe said a bunch of harsh stuff to him and he got upset, that's all we know.", "I mean their kid is in school and had a part time job. They aren't just letting their kid laze around all day", "It's not rocket science, but a lot of kids are at a disadvantage (whether small or large) because their parents didn't teach them how to cook, to budget or spend wisely, to clean and look after their environment, to have proper hygiene - or whatever it may be. \nAt some point - absolutely, adults are responsible to learn basic self and home care that they may not have been taught. But generally speaking if a parent doesn't teach their kid how to grow into a competent, functioning adult then they did a subpar job."]}
