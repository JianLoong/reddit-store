She's messy (and by messy I mean she looks like she lives in a dumpster), rude (she'll cuss you out when you eat the last of the chocolate, even if its your chocolate, because she wanted it (source: she did it to my daughter, I saw it with my own eyes)), wasteful, and quite conceited (my son and her are banned from family gatherings after a particular incident).\n\nI have told my son the truth about it when he asked for my honest opinion after I met her. But in the end he's an adult and I don't control his life.\n\nWhen he told me about the engagement, he asked me, since its been two months, if I approve of her now. I laughed a bit and told him no, I don't. And he got mad asked me why. So I gave him the following reasons:\n\n1. They're 20 and 25 and getting married, which I think is a bit to early, since they've known each other for around 7 months\n2. Neither of them have a stable income or know how to cook and clean so they're hitting a disaster zone\n3. They're not going to have a pre-nuptial\n4. Again I don't like her\n\nBut again I told him he's an adult so its his choice.\n\nI also told him they were going to have to move out because I have 3 other underage kids to look after and Sara is not at all nice or kind to them and that I won't support him and Sara, just if they are in an emergency (Right now I fully pay for and house him, he pays no rent, and he has a part time job and his monthly salary, if they budget it, will give them more than enough for essentials + savings (Sara owns her apartment so no rent), plus I am fully paying for his college so no loans to worry about), but other than that they have to figure it out something themselves.\n\nI also told him not to expect me to pay for his wedding, because A) they want a very extravagant one and B) with the cost of living rising I want to save enough money to make sure my youngest (who is in 8th right now) will have the same opportunity as him\n\nHe got mad at me and left.\n\nI recounted this to a few of my coworkers and they think I am in the wrong.

Generally your response and actions seem very reasonable.", "NTA while he actually doesn't need your approval to marry her, if he was expecting you were going to pay for the wedding, that's a bit delusional.", "NTA\nAll the examples you mentioned show, that he is still a kid. He's financial dependent from you. Foe the living, for the wedding.\n\nYou do not like the girl and they don't do anything to prove you wrong. He wants to be an adultx he has to behave like one and take over responsibility for his own life.\n\nYou are no AH. You let him the choice who to love, but you are allowed to be honest to him and that this girl is causing trouble on your family.", "NTA. All your points are valid and if he thinks he's mature enough to marry then he should be mature enough to respect your stance. Storming out is not very mature He's not entitled to your money at 25yo. Why in the world would he expect you to pay for his wedding? I think it's great you were in a position to pay for his college. That alone puts him in a better position than a lot of people. He's not an only child though, so good for you for ensuring there's enough to give all your children equal support.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right that he's an adult and you can't force him to make a different choice than the one he's made. Maybe it would be worth reminding him of how much you're still financially supporting him at his big age of 25 since children, barring extenuating circumstances, typically *start* gaining footing in their independence in their early 20's. Whereas he seems like he's not eager to make any steps towards that because he still presently expects you to keep providing for him and then some. I'm not suggesting stop paying for his college, but if you're giving him \"fun money\" allowances I think it's time to revoke that so he starts making up lost time in learning how to walk on his own two feet here. \n\nTbh, based on what you've described I'd be questioning if substance abuse is a part of this picture.", "NTA for not approving of the marriage, because he *asked* for your opinion. was your answer a bit harsh? yes, but it was also honest. is there a possibility sara is pressuring your son into marriage or has he always rushed things? either was 7 months is quite a short period to know someone", "NTA. He asked you answered. Its as simple as that. Even if she was lovely and you only had an off feeling. Still NTA. You're entitled to your own opinion at the end of the day", "This is why I think don\u2019t ask questions if you don\u2019t want a brutally honest answer", "NTA. He asked for an opinion, you gave it, and sounds like you have good reasons. You are right in that it is his decision. Just as equally, it is your house and finances, he is an adult, and you get to decide who you want in your house and who to support (I.e., you and your younger kids). Stick to your guns, he is an adult now and needs to start acting like one. Good luck.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and he got it. I must also say that your communication of this disapproval has been very respectful as well, in that you're treating him like the adult he is. Absolutely not the asshole and actually a good dad.", "NTA. At anytime you say you \"approve\" this union, they'll think they're entitled to all your support. At least if you put up this boundary now they'll think a little and hopefully be hesitant to ask for hand-outs from you. \n\nI've seen it happen to my friends with their adult kids. My friends allowed their adult children's partners to move in, then had to feed them,.clothe them. You don't want to be in the situation where youre grandparents but the grandchild is more of your own child and youre also still having to support your kid and their spouse. Y'all living under one roof and they do nothing to contribute to the household. You do not need all that headache. And it's not fair to your other kids to have to put up with that mess. I've seen it. Don't give in. You might even want to start charging them rent before they get too comfortable. \n\nDon't give them an inch, cus right now that future in law sounds like she'll take more than a mile.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.

Simple, nothing more to add on that matter.\n\nAbout paying the weeding, remind me something: when he left after you gave him your opinion, what did you say at last? \"I told him he's an adult so its his choice\", and you're right about it. You didn't give him your approval but you said it's his own decision, so he has to withstand with his decisions and consequences. If he wants his wedding, then he can pay for it.\n\nBesides, you stated that not only his girlfriend has her own apartment, but you have to support 3 other underage kids right now, and you pay for his college right now. He's time for him to man up and face the reality for once, to understand that money doesn't come in the pocket by doing nothing.\n\nYour son A-score: 3/10 (just being stupid like a \"golden kid\")\n\nYour coworkers A-score: 1/10 (smells the denial)", "Dear god nta. Your coworkers can suck a duck. Your son has a lot of waking up to do, but like you said he's an \"adult\" so you can't force him into NOT marrying this chick. Stand by your ruling of making them move out though. Sounds like you and your other kids are  in for a rough ride if they stick around. That's not fair to the other kids, and THAT would make you the ah", "NTA\n\nHe wants to play adult while living with mommy and having everything paid for.\n\nHe needs a reality check and I am glad that you have boundaries.", "NTA. Not at all!", "The marriage isn\u2019t the first issue. Why is he living rent free at home at his age?  Why is she living rent free?", "Your son is 25 and doesn\u2019t know how to clean or cook?", "WTF? What reasonable adult thinks their parent would/should stump up for their wedding and somehow magically support them? Are we getting the full facts of this story? \nAlso, have they even lived together yet? What is the rush to get married? He needs to figure out how to survive on his own in the world first.", "NAH.  I thought the brides family paid for wedding, not the grooms.  And if she owns her place he can just live with her.  Your approval isn't required either.  I don't understand why anyone is upset here.", "Fiction", "ESH, but especially him. You're his mother, if he can't cook and clean then that's your fault for not teaching him basic life skills. It also sounds like you taught him nothing of financial responsibility. Especially since you're paying for everything and he's 25. No wonder he's so entitled.\nThat being said, he's a grown man and should not be expecting his mother to sort his entire life out. He needs to grow up, his gf needs to get her head out of her ass, and you need to deal with the  consequences of your own inactions.", "Yeah, um, he\u2019s 25 and needs a pre-nup? Is he sitting on a big trust fund? \n\nMom, let your baby make mistakes. He\u2019s a man now. All you needed to say is \u201cYou\u2019re grown now, I trust you to make good decisions.\u201d \n\nNAH.

Rather that phrase it as \" I don't like her\" which makes it about you and your feelings/opinions, start calling out specific behaviors and behavior patterns that she has that are problematic.

While I don't agree that 25/20 is always too young to marry, them being together for such a short time definitely is a valid concern.\n\n3.
