My parents lived nearby and they wanted me to come stay with them while I was recovering from surgery. I continued paying rent because it was originally only meant to be for a few months at most and I didn't want to screw over my roommate, especially because we live in an expensive area.\n\nIt ended up being way longer than a few months. I had some other health issues after the original surgery recovery, and then there was reconstructive surgery upcoming and I'd need help again after that, and then my parents had health issues of their own and I wanted to stay to help them in return. After all that, I found myself dragging my feet on moving back and realized I didn't really want to go back to living with my roommate.\n\nI finally ripped the bandaid off and told her I'd be moving out officially after more than a year. Our old lease was expiring, so I told her I just wouldn't be signing a new one and I'd take my time moving out to give her plenty of time to figure things out. I dragged out my moving out over four months, taking my time moving things out slowly and selling off my old furniture. I moved the last of my stuff out of the bedroom a few weeks ago and told her it was all hers. She hadn't talked to me at all since then and I thought everything was settled until she texted me today asking for the new month's rent like it was a given.\n\nApparently she'd done nothing to prepare for this in the four months since I told her I was moving out \u2013 no roommate search, no saving up, nothing. She blamed me for it, saying she couldn't look for a new roommate since I wasn't fully moved out yet and she didn't know when I'd be out. She said she didn't realize I meant I was officially out when I said the place was hers because I'd still left some stuff in the kitchen and basement and hadn't given her the key (the key is my bad since I forgot I still had it, and I don't even remember what I might have in storage in the basement after so long, but I left the kitchenware on purpose since she used it). I asked what was the point in taking my time moving out and giving her an extra four months of rent if she wasn't going to save up or look for a new roommate until I was fully out anyway. She says she couldn't save any money in that time because she'd had to go to the hospital and had to pay the hospital bills, but she just bought herself a new smart-bed when moving into my old room so I think that's just an excuse.\n\nI eventually got tired of arguing with her (this was all over text) so I just drove over and told her I'd left the key in the mailbox and she could throw out anything of mine she didn't want. I can accept some blame for forgetting to give her the key or apparently not making it clear enough that I was officially moved out, but I feel like she should have used the last few months to prepare for this somehow and just used me as an excuse to put it off.

You didn\u2019t even return keys until she called asking for next month\u2019s rent while also leaving some items behind. It\u2019s also not her job to get rid of the stuff you left behind.

YTA", "ESH\n\nYou needed to directly communicate with your landlord and your former roommate that your timeline is. \n\nYour lease goes month-to-month if you don't do a full half-year/year renew. You're legally obligated to communicate with the landlord your own self that you will be leaving, usually under a 30-45 day notice. You're morally obligated to tell your roommate 'i will be fully out by x date. I've notified the landlord', as that gives them time to figure out the situation. \n\n'uh, I'll be out eventually?' does not cut it. Neither does 'oh, I finished moving out last week.

You needed to choose a move out date and communicate it clearly to your roommate. Saying that you were going to move out and then dragging it out slooooowly was not actually helpful. How was she supposed to hunt for a new roommate when she couldn't even tell them exactly when they could move in? 2. Leases don't end just because you want them to. Since it rolled to an automatic month to month, you'll need to communicate to your landlord in writing. Check your lease to see how many days you have to notify them in advance; now you'll have to keep paying rent until then. 3. You are responsible for your own stuff. You can't just leave all the crud you didn't feel like dealing with; you need to ASK if she even wants any of the stuff you left, and then YOU take responsibility for clearing out everything she doesn't want. And clean thoroughly afterwards - especially if you want your share of the damage deposit back.", "a little esh.\n\nDid the lease run out or not? If not then you owe the funds. Usually if you back out of a lease, you do the work to find the replacement, this is to insure that your liabilities and responsibilities are no longer yours.  You being sick obviously make that harder. Your roommate should want to take an active part in this, but for whatever reason she was not. \n\nMoving out slowly like an inch worm and forgetting stuff makes understanding is you actually left alot harder....you really should be hammering that she is now one her own and you are out. ask if she needs anything before you take off for good...something more than what was said.\n\nShe should have asked more questions and also take a more active role jn what was happening.\n\nIf you left when the lease ran out, NTA...you made clear that was your intention, and tou did it.", "The old lease I was on expired, and I don't believe I'm on the hook unless I sign a new one, but I'm not an expert (I'm in the US).", "Not so sure. OP also says that she didn\u2019t do a good enough job of making it clear that she was moving out. I think we need more info. The biggest question is did she leave anything there past the end of the lease?", "many leases tuen into a month to month...very poorly executed moveout for sure.", "I never had any communication with the landlord, but our landlord has always been very uncommunicative. I used to pay the full rent directly to the landlord with my roommate just giving me her half, and then we swapped with me just giving her my half after I went to stay with my parents. I paid rent for the entire time I was on the lease and then some, I just didn't sign a new one when it was up.", "The lease was up at the end of the month when I first told her I'd be moving out, so I still had property there for a few months afterward, but roommate said the landlord didn't write up a new lease anyway, and in our area the rental agreement switches to a monthly situation if there's no new lease. I paid for every month before all my stuff was out (aside from the kitchen stuff I left for her or whatever junk I forgot in the basement).", "you need to talk to the landlord.. and double check... most states require a written 30day notice to quit..(move out) unless you have a replacement and that needs to be done in writing.

Bit of a surprise to me too)\n\nThe OP feels they didn't make it clear enough because their flatmate didn't do anything about finding a new roomie.

I don't even know what I left in the basement, and I figured I was basically gifting all the kitchen stuff to my roommate.
