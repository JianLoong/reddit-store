We rent off a family friend, so the rent isn't too bad and it's actually how we ended up living together in the first place as we were offered it on the cheapish. Otherwise we'd never have ended up living in this situation. \n\nSo out of the blue I get a text from my sister (who's away on holidays with her bf) saying that her boyfriend is moving in in a few weeks time and it's ok cos she already cleared it with the landlord. This has not been discussed in any way yet with me or my gf. In fact the opposite was... there's been a few periods when he'd come over and stay for a week+ in a row and we'd had conversations how the place wasn't that big and was very cramped when he stayed over for more than a coupe days. It particularly feels this way as they both work from home and don't have to do too many hours in work. Whereas the 2 of us are the opposite having to go into work and dont get home until 6.30ish meaning we're only home in the evenings if we're not out doing something after work.\n\nI understand how she wants to move her relationship forward and obviously wants to build something with him but feel that we've been put in a seriously awkward position as if we don't say anything we'll end up falling out and me and my gf will probs end up having to move out so that we have enough space. Whereas on the other hand if we do say something it's obviously going to drive a big wedge in between the lot of us which we obviously don't want either.. \n\nWhat are peoples thoughts? How should we go about resolving the situation?\n\nEdit 1: lot of people highlighting the lease situation. Noted that there is none in place, so we don't have anything in writing which would prohibit this move in. However, the 3 of us moved in together as a group initially on the basis that this would be the living situation.\n\nWe've had multiple discussions about the size of the apartment before and how there wouldn't be space for another person to move in.\n\nUnderstand how in a completly fair situation she would get a chance to live with her SO but the circumstances aren't exactly fair for that given the agreed arrangement up until this message was sent to me. (To note they've been going out for 18 months and broke up for 3 in the middle, while menand the gf are together 5 years) If this was a bigger apartment there'd be as much of a problem. The first big issue is space. \n\nThe next which I hadn't mentioned is he's extremely messy and not curtious when it comes to sharing the space whenever he's over. Will come in and take up the kitchen/living room by WFH during the day, not cleaning up after himself after work, leaves a mess when cooking and then will happily sit down on the couch watching TV for the evening so that we're confined to the bedroom. \n\nLot of info in the above edit but just trying to make the full picture clear as to why it will be a very uncomfortable situation if he was to move in.", "created_utc": 1686889759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14an02e/aita_for_saying_my_sisters_boyfriend_cant_move/", "score": 769, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You make it sound like it's just you and your gf living there, but it's you, your gf and your sister.\n\nAnyway, you and your sister are both living in a rental apartment with family bonus (cheap rent). That family bonus is an important key factor. \n\nThe owners of the apartment presumably has the same relationship to you and your sister, so they want to treat you both the same way. \n\nYou had the option to get the family bonus for yourself and your gf. Now your sister wants the exact same conditions, family bonus for herself and her bf.\n\nI get that this impacts your living quality, but at the same time, your gf has impacted your sisters living quality in a similar way. If your gf had not been there, it would have been only you and your sister, and the apartment would have been even less crowded.\n\nThe only difference between you and your sister is that she wants to change status quo, whereas you have always had the double family bonus. I don't think \"first come first serve\" is fair in this situation. Why would you and your gf get a cheap apartment from your family friend, but your sister is second in line and has to rent one for regular price? That's not fair.\n\nIf the apartment is really too crowded, a good compromise would be to find a comparable one for one couple and split the cost of both rents. So that both couples have equal family bonus. \n\nAs of now, I say YTA, because I don't think you have the right to complain", "YTA. Your post is deliberately misleading as your sister lives in the apartment too. It\u2019s not fair that you are able to live there with your partner but your sister isn\u2019t. The landlord is ok with it so if you don\u2019t like it then move. It\u2019s not your property and you don\u2019t have a lease so you can\u2019t dictate who gets to live there", "So how are you not the asshole when you already got your gf living in a space where maybe your sister didn\u2019t want to share with an extra person?", "ESH - you make it sound like it's just you and your GF living alone, but it's you and your GF in 1 room and your sister also living with you in the other room. It's as much her place as it is yours and she's already cleared it with the person who really gets to have a say in the decision, the landlord. \n\nI will say, you should have been the phone call before the landlord and it should have included a discussion and plan of action; it definitely sounds like she sprung this on you without much notice and probably is aware that it's been cramped when he's stayed over previously so will definitely be a big transition which will impact both you and your GF. \n\nYou can say that you don't want him moving in but it won't really solve much since it sounds like it's already a done deal and will most likely just cause tension right off the bat (if you think it's not done and that your sister might actually understand, go for it, but your post doesn't make it sound that way). \n\nYour options really are to make the best of it (probably should sit down and try to figure out solutions to anything you considered a problem from when he has stayed there previously, while keeping in mind that this will be an adjustment for him as well and that he deserves to be able to settle in, so grace is need on both sides) or start looking for a new place asap.

Either might cause her to move out or to then hold it against me.", "I, too, am annoyed at OP for making it sound in the opening like it's just him and his gf in a 2-bedroom apartment.\n\nOP, you, your sister, and your girlfriend need to have a sit-down conversation about all of this - that you don't want another person in the place and then what changes need to be made if she insists (expense split, for example). You should also be prepared to find another place or try to push your sister out. Start with a talk between you three about your sister's proposal.

That contradicts nothing I said - she's trying to move someone else in without asking them.  Normally when you lease a place, to change those terms, everyone has to agree.  \n\nIf the sister wants to move someone else in, she needed to ask.  And if the landlord says they're not interfering, OP should tell them then we'll have no choice but to move out, and tell the sister that if you force us to move out, that will be the last time we speak for a long time if ever, because you don't get to just throw my life on the fire for your own wants.", "Have you confirmed with the landlord that it\u2019s actually ok with him?", "Yep, sorry you're dealing with it, but not your fault, it's gonna be an unpleasant conversation because your sister seemingly doesn't mind making your lives very uncomfortable.  She should have discussed this idea with you before bringing it up with the BF or landlord, and any considerate person would know this - she is trying to force you, and that's the cause of the conflict.", "It's not an official lease so that's where it's a bit blurry.

I get why you wouldn't want him there, but it's unfair to your sister. I think more than lack of space. The issue is that you don't like how he shares (or more accurately doesn't share) the space in the common areas, right? So make some rules about that as a condition of him moving in - and the rules apply to everyone. \n\nSo kitchen mess gets cleaned up immediately, no WFH in public spaces, divide up who gets the TV during the week, etc. Things like that. You don't have to just hide in your room & endure it.", "YTA,  when it comes down to it if it's ok for you to have a SO there it is for her too.    It's cleared with the landlord already.    What you can do is put your foot down about the common areas and demand rules for availability.    WFH should be relegated to bedrooms etc.   You shot yourself in the foot with starting out with \"he can't be here at all\" though.", "OP - it's normal to feel upset about this situation after you've been living in a way that suits you for 1.5 years now, and it'll be disruptive to your routine to have him move in. I think you do understand that you are being unfair to think you get the privilege of having your girlfriend live there, but your sister doesn't get that privilege. But you think the disruption to you is more important than the unfairness to your sister. It isn't. And if you think about it honestly, you know this.\n\nYou should all sit down and talk about your concerns re overcrowding and how this is going to work, and come up with a roommate agreement. It is different having someone there for a few days than it is living with that person. Once he moves in, it'll take a bit of time establishing a new routine. Unless this guy is a problem roommate, you'll adjust in time to having him there. And if it's still a problem, then at that time, you try to figure out a new plan. You need to open your mind a bit and realize you are jumping to conclusions about how it's going to be, and really consider if it is worth it to possibly wreck your relationship with your sister.\n\nETA: YTA", "YTA!\nYour sister pays more than you on the rent. Although the three of you moved in together, things change. I\u2019d say she went to the landlord before you because she knew how you\u2019d react, and you\u2019re proving her right. \nUnless your girlfriend is moving out, it\u2019s unfair to think that only you and her can benefit from the apartment. \nYou guys can work around and ask for the lar to WFH from their bedroom and/or set up a home office for him in a corner. I\u2019ve seen 4 people sharing a one bedroom apartment that\u2019s the size of my bedroom in Dublin. There is room for both siblings and their partners. So either your partner leave or her partner move in.", "i\u2019m gonna say nah. it\u2019s understandable that you wouldn\u2019t want another person living with you, but it\u2019s obvious why your sister would want to have her partner living with her just as you do. i agree with the other commenters\u2014 it might be time to consider moving out. maybe use the reduction in your rent save up and find another place with your girlfriend", "Going against the grain here NTA/ESH. its not exactly 'fair' to her but the three of you all *agreed* to move into this place as just the three of you. She wants to change the status quo and move a fourth person into a cramped apartment. \n\nDoes the landlord know you are not supportive of this move? Given its a family friend etc he probably just okayed it and didnt give it much thought.", "NTA, your sister is being sneaky doing this shit behind your back. Thr place isn't big enough for 4 and you got there first. I'd bring up the issues you've mentioned here with your sister, his attitude when it's already not his place doesn't bode well for future harmony. I predict that you will move out if he moves in. I'd also contact the landlord and raise your objections as this was never agreed with you. Of the answer is...no lease...tough shit...then just give notice and mention how a consultation would have been nice.", "Unless your girlfriend is moving out, it\u2019s unfair to think that only you and her can benefit from the apartment.", "One roommate arbitrarily bringing in another person without discussing it with the other people who already live there isn\u2019t an AH move because it\u2019s their boyfriend?", "because the three of them agreed to that at the time?? And shes trying to change the terms of the agreement", "See, you've made your post deliberately misleading so YTA for that on its own really", "It sounds like OP was just expecting the sister to move out at some point and have the cheap rent to themselves so I have to ask what the catalyst event that they saw changing this living arrangement was. Engagement? A raise? Both neccessary to justify and afford no sister living there? Valid complaint, too many people- but all good things come to an end and it is a majorly unfair complaint to the sibling moving in at the same time who was 3rd wheel for 1.5 years. Honestly sounds like NY isn\u2019t the right place for this couple as with them saving so much already and living together so long a larger place of their own is the logical next step which is\u2026unattainable? Majority rules kinda but also it\u2019s a privilege to live there and the sister and SO have no complaints so. If you\u2019ve been living together 1.5 years (so likely together for 2-4 years) it\u2019s time to discuss living alone together anyways, right?", "so she\u2019s paying more than the two of you and yet she doesn\u2019t have a say? You pay 35% and so does your girlfriend. \nYTA.", "That actually depends on if you and your GF already got the master bedroom and possibly an ensuite bathroom. If you get a larger room, then it can be perfectly valid that you continue to pay more of the rent. The only thing that should definitely become 50/50 is the utilities", "NTA because she didn't discuss this with you beforehand she went directly to the landlord. Also because her bf comes in makes a mess then leaves it for someone else to clean then commandeers the whole living room with no respect for the fact that there are other people that live there and he does not. but i dont really think you have any choice in the matter except to see if your family friend has another apartment or find another one. this is something you wont win on", "ESH. Your sister has just as much right to have her boyfriend there as you do. If you want cheap rent, you will just have to suck it up. The only thing you can do is insist that your sister's boyfriend do his share of cleaning and that he can't live like a slob. Rules are important is such a confined space. \n\nIf the second couple works from home, they should do their food prep and cleanup before you get home. You have equal rights to all common spaces.  He doesn't get to take over the tv.\n\nMany people living in a small space is doable for the sake of saving money if everyone follows house rules and respects others. We once lived 10 young, working adults in a small 3 bedroom house with only one bathroom. Everyone was given a 15 minute time slot to shower . Thank goodness we had slightly different schedules and were able to make it work. \n\nIf you are lucky, your sister and her BF will break up soon or move elsewhere once they get the chance to find something else.", "NTA.  Tell your sister the truth.  Your apartment isn't big enough to share between 4 people and if she did move in with her SO, it would ruin your relationship and you would hate for that to happen.  That is the fact, with the slobby SO a second round of ammunition if needed.  Sometimes 'No' is the answer.  Apologize for the situation and try to help her find an alternative.", "Yta based on what's good for the goose, is good for the gander. \n\nYou'll have to implement schedules and rules, ie:\n\nLiving room schedules if it is truly too small to all occupy at the same time. Specifically when you and your GF come home from work and settle y'all should be able to get an hour or two in the living room as they WFH and have free access all day \n\nHe needs to understand in small spaces picking up after himself within a timely fashion is imperative. Like cook and eat but once done eating clean up his mess, not leave it till the next day or whatever so that the facilities and utensils are readily available for others. \n\nMaybe have a once a month meeting as a family (he is family op, as he and your sister are committed) to iron out any wrinkles in the dynamic without animosities brewing", "Is he planning to pay his share of rent and bills? I'm assuming it's currently split 3 ways, so would him moving in split it 4 ways now? If it's split 50/50 with you and your girlfriend only paying half, then yes, it's totally fair for your sister to move in her boyfriend, but split three ways is more of a gray area....\n\nDid your sister ask or just tell you it's happening?\n\nCan you and your girlfriend just move out? \n\nFrom what's been said about the boyfriend being messy and rude, I'm going to tentatively say NTA, but it's really close to ESH. Your sister should be asking, not telling, and it sounds like he's a shitty person to live with, but it also sounds like it is only really fair if your sister can also move someone in since your girlfriend lives with you (depending on how costs are split)\n\nBest scenario is you and your girlfriend just move out. No drama that way. Your sister gets what she wants, you and your girlfriend get the peace you want, no relationships are damaged, and you don't have to live with a slob....", "YTA.

Fine for you to live with your girlfriend in that apartment. But now your sister can't do the same.", "Give us an update !!!", "NAH it\u2019s reasonable for your sister to want her bf to move in when your girlfriend lives there, fair even. While you mention too crowded for 4 what I pick up on is more of how he is an inconsiderate and incompatible roommate. Up until now he has been coming and treating it as entirely his home and you have accommodated him because he is a guest and it was temporary. At a minimum you need to have a roommates meeting one with your sister first about your concerns regarding him moving in and then deciding how to bring their concerns to him. It\u2019s possible he is willing and he is certainly able to clean up after himself. Agreements like the common space isn\u2019t used to wfh during certain times, even a schedule for which nights which roommates have access to the living room tv etc. This may work with rules structure and a schedule.", "YTA. Your post is very misleading, you made it sound like it\u2019s just you and your girlfriend living there but your sister also lives there.

At that point I might as well be in a studio.", "If sister is uncomfortable with girlfriend, she shouldn't have agreed to share an apartment with her.", "I definitely agree that the sister should get the same accommodations as the brother (having their partner share their bedroom), but you do need to understand that the GF here is not a guest in this house. I guess I'm arguing semantics at this point but the argument of \"brother gets a guest, so sister should too\" isn't exactly valid. GF has been living there as long as the other two, and both the brother and his gf should have been talked to before the landlord agreed to let sister have someone move in. I'm not saying the brother or gf should get the final say, but they should have been talked to about it before any decisions were made. This is their home for crying out loud!", "OK, so chop both OP's GF and Sister's BF down the middle, and let half of each live there and benefit from the largesse of OP's and Sister's common family friend. I mean, if only three people can live there; 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 3... What's that you say, we don't do half people, only whole ones? Well, OP has had his whole GF there for quite a while now. Why isn't it his sister's turn now? If not now, then when? \n\n> WHY would you screw over the gf?\n\nWhy would _you_ then _continue_ to screw over the sister?\n\n> Because you think op is a meanie?\n\nNo, because it's unfair that only he gets to live with his SO. How utterly blind does one have to be not to see that?", ">All three of the original leaseholders\n\nThere are no leaseholders as there is no lease. This is an unofficial situation where the landlord sets rent cheap and so OP and the other tenants forego certain legal protections in return, and they use OP's parents as the thing that protects and enforces this relationship. \n\n>She is an equal to the siblings -- she's not getting a free ride and she's not there 'under the table.' Yes, the cheap rent is because of the siblings' relationship with the landlord, but GF makes it even cheaper with a three-way split instead of a two-way split.\n\nShe could leave and be easily replaced (by the BF). She's not all that special or important. She's only important to OP. When she's the least important person in the situation, and she objectively is, she gets the least say. I doubt the landlord gives a fuck whether it's the GF there or the BF there as long as they get their money. The sister would probably rather have her BF there than OP's GF. The only person that cares whether the GF is there or not is OP.\n\n>If all five parties don't agree to the change, then there will not be four people in the apartment. Either the new tenant doesn't move in, or one or more of the original tenants leave.\n\nExactly. And so OP can either suck it up or he can move out. \n\nWhat exactly was OP's plan? Did he just expect his sister to never enter a serious relationship? Did he expect her to leave their place with cheap rent so he can be comfortable? What exactly was the endgame? Or did OP just think to himself \"I've got cheap rent and can live with my partner. Sister's problems are hers to sort out\"? She's an adult who's going to inevitably have adult relationships. This happening could've been seen from a mile away and it's unreasonable to expect her to just be alone or move out to do the exact same thing OP is doing.\n\n>Having a roommate who works in the communal space means that you only have reliable access to the bathroom and your bedroom. That'd be a deal breaker for me. At that point I might as well be in a studio.\n\nOP and his GF work on site. Why would it matter if one person works in the communal space while they're not even at home? Oh no! The communal space is being used when half the house isn't at home. So much discomfort. \n\nWould a studio even be cheaper when you've already got low rent and it's being split among 2 couples?", "Why does it matter if they were told or not if they don't have the final say? It's not like this is a random, completely unexpected event. The sister is an adult in a relationship, which both OP and the GF (presumably) knew. Provided they didn't break up permanently first, this wasn't a matter of \"if\" but a matter of \"when\" and they got their few weeks heads up.", "How do you know OP didn't set up the whole thing by constantly gaslighting his sister into thinking they couldn't have a 4th person living with them (which is what I was talking about btw)?\n\nAnd I agree kicking out OP's gf is silly, but I never said anything about that to begin with. You might have me confused with a different poster. So no, not 'by my own logic' lol.", "Legally, by NY state law, they are on a month-to-month lease. If the landlord chooses to end the lease, they must give 30 days notice for the tenants to leave. If the tenants leave, they must give 30 days notice. If the terms of the lease change, there must be 30 days notice given. OP, the sister, and the GF are not squatters, and are not without rights in the situation, even if they don't have a traditional lease with a set expiration date. They are legal tenants with all of the standing that provides them.\n\nI think OP was expecting his sister to treat him as she would any roommate. 'Hey, I'd like to live with my partner. What do you think of a fourth roommate?' Not 'Oh by the way, the landlord approved a fourth roommate kthanksbye.' One is mature, the other isn't.\n\nAlso, wtf? GF of five years is replaceable? Yes, relationships break down and end, but holy hell! She's a person, not a sex toy. And sister can prefer her BF all she wants. It'd be rather awkward if sister would rather hook up with her brother's GF than her own BF. This isn't about who likes who better, it's about OP and his GF not wanting to live in this space with the sister's BF.\n\nA lot of WFH positions don't follow standard work hours, especially if you have breaks during the work day for things like doctors appointments. You either take that as PTO...or you make up hours in the evening. In the communal space, in this instance.\n\nAnd living space is always a compromise. Do you pay more for privacy and control over your own space? Do you pay less, but give up privacy and have less access to the total space you pay for? Do you pay a high price for a great location, or do you go remote and find cheaper digs in a less fashionable area? Everyone will have their own balance point.", "You speak as someone that has very little or no actual perspective for a situation like this. You're speaking in black and white, but this situation is very much grey-area. Discussing things that are going to drastically change your life before they happen is a very normal and adult thing that happens in life. This should have been no different. Try and put yourself in their shoes. How would you react to this without any warning? You'd just sit back and say \"oh well, I shoulda known!\" Doubtful. You know you'd be upset.", "You get real. Not continuing to let OP benefit wildly more than his sister from an arrangement by a family friend of hers just as much as his is just simple fairness, not \u201cscrewing him over\u201d. Why are you so hellbent on _continuing_ the screwing-over of his sister?", ">Legally, by NY state law, they are on a month-to-month lease.\n\nIf its on month to month basis then the lease ends every month no? So why can't the BF just move in at the start of the lease? Logically he'd then have as much right to be there as the GF since they're both now there since the start of that month's lease.\n\n\n>I think OP was expecting his sister to treat him as she would any roommate. 'Hey, I'd like to live with my partner. What do you think of a fourth roommate?' Not 'Oh by the way, the landlord approved a fourth roommate kthanksbye.' One is mature, the other isn't.\n\nAnd the he says no and then what? This was clearly the inevitable conclusion. OP just wants his sister to leave so that he can get the cheap place to himself and is using the fact that he and his GF outnumber the sister to force her out if she wants to have a serious relationship. So to that end he's making it inhospitable to her relationship. \"I can have my partner but YOU can't. My partner and I have decided on it. We outnumber you. If you don't like it, you can leave\"\n\n>Also, wtf? GF of five years is replaceable? Yes, relationships break down and end, but holy hell! She's a person, not a sex toy. And sister can prefer her BF all she wants. It'd be rather awkward if sister would rather hook up with her brother's GF than her own BF. This isn't about who likes who better, it's about OP and his GF not wanting to live in this space with the sister's BF.\n\nReplaceable regarding the living situation? Yes. Landlord likely doesn't give a fuck whether the GF or BF are living there as long as they get the rent money. To the renting situation, the GF doesn't matter. There is someone who is willing and able to replace her. As an individual she is just contributing rent money, which anyone can do. OP and the sister have connections which make this situation possible to begin with. I never said anything about the siblings fucking each other's partners. Idk why your mind went there.\n\n>A lot of WFH positions don't follow standard work hours, especially if you have breaks during the work day for things like doctors appointments. You either take that as PTO...or you make up hours in the evening. In the communal space, in this instance\n\nThat's such a small inconvenience. That sounds like something that would happen once in a while rather than regularly. You make it sound like they're going to start working when OP and his GF come home and so they'll spend the day at work and then spend the evening and night in their bedroom.", "They got several weeks heads up. You agreed she doesn't need their permission. What more do you want? It's not like he's just moving in tomorrow. There's nothing to discuss because they don't get to decide how her relationship works. There's just a matter of informing and they've been informed weeks in advance.", "Not at all no but if something like this was to be considered you'd think that any considerate person  would bring it up directly with the ppl it affects rather than tiptoeing behind their backs and dropping it like a bomb.\n\nNope, the family friend offered the 3 of us move in initially as they also knew my gf so she was part of the agreement when we moved in.", "I can't say that you are the biggest asshole on here, but definitely super manipulative, and you know all the reasons why. Fuck you, you don't pay as much as your sister so why the fuck do you think you have any say in this? Landlord agreed to it, so deal with it or move out.\n\n Have a grown up conversation with the people in your life instead of coming on here and painting it in your favor while slowly leaving a trail of crumbs showing how poorly you painted yourself.", "ESH, you can\u2019t just dictate that she doesn\u2019t get her partner to move in when the landlord cleared it. You should sit her down and discuss it that 4 people is too much and you need to figure out if you and your gf need to move out or your sister needs to move out with her bf. She didn\u2019t create this situation it\u2019s a natural progression of life. You and your gf need to decide if you can afford to rent another place or cover the rent of the whole apartment.", "I think all the commenters are missing the fact that the sister didn't broach the subject prior to telling him that her BF was moving in. The fact that she only cleared it with the landlord and not the other occupants of the apartment was an asshole move on her part. She should have talked with them first. OP mentioned that he had stayed over for a week here and a week there, but it was too cramped then. It will be even worse when it becomes a permanent thing. There should have been a discussion about it prior to her clearing it with the landlord. I say OP is NTA.\n\nGranted, adding a 4th person will reduce the amount of rent contributed by everyone to 25% per person. \n\nHonestly, this post will eventually turn into an entitled people post when the BF continues usurping everything (claiming it's for WFH) and not cleaning up after himself. I know I am not getting his side of things, but based solely on this post, that's my opinion.", "NTA the three of you moved in there together, with the agreement that it would be the three of you.  If she wanted to add her bf, that's something she should have discussed with her two roommates, before ever talking to the landlord.", "NTA it wasnt a discussion, it was her telling you. It was sneaky and life isnt fair. If she really wanted to live with her bf so desperately she should have discussed it and prepared for the answer being no to which she can give her notice to go live with him elsewhere.\n\nI get that people will say OP should move out but OP isnt the one that demanded a change in circumstances.", "ESH she is an absolutely an ass hole for not discussing it first but you always don\u2019t a have a right to say no because your gf lives there\u2019s. I feel like maybe it\u2019s time to find a new living situation. She sucks  worse than you for springing a new roommate who you don\u2019t particularly enjoy on you with saying a thing.", "NTA. The apartment is not big enough. It would be better for your sister to move out and then she and bf can live together in their own place. Otherwise tell your sister the apartment is too small and you do not agree for him to move in", "I would say let him move in but have ground rules for everyone (everyone the same rules) and if they don\u2019t, whoever it is gets 3 strikes then out. If the sisters bf wants to move in he will have to pull his own weight.", "How is it misleading? OP does mention that OP, and OP\u2019s girlfriend lives with OP\u2019s sister\u2026\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend and I have been living in the same 2 bed apartment with my sister in NY city for the last 1.5 years.\u201d", "Also if it gets too cramped and you can\u2019t deal with it then either you and your gf or her and her bf moves out and gets a different place.", "She really should have discussed it with you first as that was a AH move on her part", "The post was edited. The \"with my sister\" was not there in the beginning.", " It's ok for you to have your GF live there but not your sisters BF. YTA. Why do you get to have a live in partner and she doesn't? Did you discuss it with her before your GF moved in?", "He's only paying 30 gf is 30 sister is 40", "Yeah, so if the guy moves in then it should be 25% each unless there is a serious difference in stuff like bedroom size/master suite.", "Yep", "Some people do things they're not comfortable with because they love the person they do it for. Or they expect reciprocation. Two things OP doesn't seem to care for. \n\nOP and his GF are obviously using their numbers advantage to bully the sister out of the apartment. Nobody can move in without their permission and they won't let the sister move in her bf. So the sister's only option is to move out to a more expensive place so that OP and the gf get the cheap apartment all to themselves.", "learn what gaslighting means please", ">What more do you want?\n\nHuman decency, especially from family. Taking this \"technically I am in the right\" approach is a great way to end relationships. You don't treat the people you love with \"technically.\" The sister going behind their backs to get the bf moved in was a shitty move and you know it. You're being willfully ignorant of common decency. Telling her brother \"this is happening whether you like it or not\" is not the same as having a discussion. Your family deserves a discussion, even if you know what the outcome will be before having it. What the sister did was incredibly shitty behavior and I hope you never have to experience this situation yourself."]}
