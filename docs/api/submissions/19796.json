We rent off a family friend, so the rent isn't too bad and it's actually how we ended up living together in the first place as we were offered it on the cheapish. Otherwise we'd never have ended up living in this situation. \n\nSo out of the blue I get a text from my sister (who's away on holidays with her bf) saying that her boyfriend is moving in in a few weeks time and it's ok cos she already cleared it with the landlord. This has not been discussed in any way yet with me or my gf. In fact the opposite was... there's been a few periods when he'd come over and stay for a week+ in a row and we'd had conversations how the place wasn't that big and was very cramped when he stayed over for more than a coupe days. It particularly feels this way as they both work from home and don't have to do too many hours in work. Whereas the 2 of us are the opposite having to go into work and dont get home until 6.30ish meaning we're only home in the evenings if we're not out doing something after work.\n\nI understand how she wants to move her relationship forward and obviously wants to build something with him but feel that we've been put in a seriously awkward position as if we don't say anything we'll end up falling out and me and my gf will probs end up having to move out so that we have enough space. Whereas on the other hand if we do say something it's obviously going to drive a big wedge in between the lot of us which we obviously don't want either.. \n\nWhat are peoples thoughts? How should we go about resolving the situation?\n\nEdit 1: lot of people highlighting the lease situation. Noted that there is none in place, so we don't have anything in writing which would prohibit this move in. However, the 3 of us moved in together as a group initially on the basis that this would be the living situation.\n\nWe've had multiple discussions about the size of the apartment before and how there wouldn't be space for another person to move in.\n\nUnderstand how in a completly fair situation she would get a chance to live with her SO but the circumstances aren't exactly fair for that given the agreed arrangement up until this message was sent to me. (To note they've been going out for 18 months and broke up for 3 in the middle, while menand the gf are together 5 years) If this was a bigger apartment there'd be as much of a problem. The first big issue is space. \n\nThe next which I hadn't mentioned is he's extremely messy and not curtious when it comes to sharing the space whenever he's over. Will come in and take up the kitchen/living room by WFH during the day, not cleaning up after himself after work, leaves a mess when cooking and then will happily sit down on the couch watching TV for the evening so that we're confined to the bedroom. \n\nLot of info in the above edit but just trying to make the full picture clear as to why it will be a very uncomfortable situation if he was to move in.", "created_utc": 1686889759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14an02e/aita_for_saying_my_sisters_boyfriend_cant_move/", "score": 501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You make it sound like it's just you and your gf living there, but it's you, your gf and your sister.\n\nAnyway, you and your sister are both living in a rental apartment with family bonus (cheap rent). That family bonus is an important key factor. \n\nThe owners of the apartment presumably has the same relationship to you and your sister, so they want to treat you both the same way. \n\nYou had the option to get the family bonus for yourself and your gf. Now your sister wants the exact same conditions, family bonus for herself and her bf.\n\nI get that this impacts your living quality, but at the same time, your gf has impacted your sisters living quality in a similar way. If your gf had not been there, it would have been only you and your sister, and the apartment would have been even less crowded.\n\nThe only difference between you and your sister is that she wants to change status quo, whereas you have always had the double family bonus. I don't think \"first come first serve\" is fair in this situation. Why would you and your gf get a cheap apartment from your family friend, but your sister is second in line and has to rent one for regular price? That's not fair.\n\nIf the apartment is really too crowded, a good compromise would be to find a comparable one for one couple and split the cost of both rents. So that both couples have equal family bonus. \n\nAs of now, I say YTA, because I don't think you have the right to complain", "YTA. Your post is deliberately misleading as your sister lives in the apartment too. It\u2019s not fair that you are able to live their with your partner but your sister isn\u2019t. The landlord is ok with it so if you don\u2019t like it then move. It\u2019s not your property and you don\u2019t have a lease so you can\u2019t dictate who gets to live there", "So how are you not the asshole when you already got your gf living in a space where maybe your sister didn\u2019t want to share with an extra person?", "ESH - you make it sound like it's just you and your GF living alone, but it's you and your GF in 1 room and your sister also living with you in the other room. It's as much her place as it is yours and she's already cleared it with the person who really gets to have a say in the decision, the landlord. \n\nI will say, you should have been the phone call before the landlord and it should have included a discussion and plan of action; it definitely sounds like she sprung this on you without much notice and probably is aware that it's been cramped when he's stayed over previously so will definitely be a big transition which will impact both you and your GF. \n\nYou can say that you don't want him moving in but it won't really solve much since it sounds like it's already a done deal and will most likely just cause tension right off the bat (if you think it's not done and that your sister might actually understand, go for it, but your post doesn't make it sound that way). \n\nYour options really are to make the best of it (probably should sit down and try to figure out solutions to anything you considered a problem from when he has stayed there previously, while keeping in mind that this will be an adjustment for him as well and that he deserves to be able to settle in, so grace is need on both sides) or start looking for a new place asap.

Either might cause her to move out or to then hold it against me.", "I, too, am annoyed at OP for making it sound in the opening like it's just him and his gf in a 2-bedroom apartment.\n\nOP, you, your sister, and your girlfriend need to have a sit-down conversation about all of this - that you don't want another person in the place and then what changes need to be made if she insists (expense split, for example). You should also be prepared to find another place or try to push your sister out. Start with a talk between you three about your sister's proposal.

That contradicts nothing I said - she's trying to move someone else in without asking them.  Normally when you lease a place, to change those terms, everyone has to agree.  \n\nIf the sister wants to move someone else in, she needed to ask.  And if the landlord says they're not interfering, OP should tell them then we'll have no choice but to move out, and tell the sister that if you force us to move out, that will be the last time we speak for a long time if ever, because you don't get to just throw my life on the fire for your own wants.", "Have you confirmed with the landlord that it\u2019s actually ok with him?", "Yep, sorry you're dealing with it, but not your fault, it's gonna be an unpleasant conversation because your sister seemingly doesn't mind making your lives very uncomfortable.  She should have discussed this idea with you before bringing it up with the BF or landlord, and any considerate person would know this - she is trying to force you, and that's the cause of the conflict.", "It's not an official lease so that's where it's a bit blurry.

I get why you wouldn't want him there, but it's unfair to your sister. I think more than lack of space. The issue is that you don't like how he shares (or more accurately doesn't share) the space in the common areas, right? So make some rules about that as a condition of him moving in - and the rules apply to everyone. \n\nSo kitchen mess gets cleaned up immediately, no WFH in public spaces, divide up who gets the TV during the week, etc. Things like that. You don't have to just hide in your room & endure it.", "YTA,  when it comes down to it if it's ok for you to have a SO there it is for her too.    It's cleared with the landlord already.    What you can do is put your foot down about the common areas and demand rules for availability.    WFH should be relegated to bedrooms etc.   You shot yourself in the foot with starting out with \"he can't be here at all\" though.", "OP - it's normal to feel upset about this situation after you've been living in a way that suits you for 1.5 years now, and it'll be disruptive to your routine to have him move in. I think you do understand that you are being unfair to think you get the privilege of having your girlfriend live there, but your sister doesn't get that privilege. But you think the disruption to you is more important than the unfairness to your sister. It isn't. And if you think about it honestly, you know this.\n\nYou should all sit down and talk about your concerns re overcrowding and how this is going to work, and come up with a roommate agreement. It is different having someone there for a few days than it is living with that person. Once he moves in, it'll take a bit of time establishing a new routine. Unless this guy is a problem roommate, you'll adjust in time to having him there. And if it's still a problem, then at that time, you try to figure out a new plan. You need to open your mind a bit and realize you are jumping to conclusions about how it's going to be, and really consider if it is worth it to possibly wreck your relationship with your sister.\n\nETA: YTA", "YTA!\nYour sister pays more than you on the rent. Although the three of you moved in together, things change. I\u2019d say she went to the landlord before you because she knew how you\u2019d react, and you\u2019re proving her right. \nUnless your girlfriend is moving out, it\u2019s unfair to think that only you and her can benefit from the apartment. \nYou guys can work around and ask for the lar to WFH from their bedroom and/or set up a home office for him in a corner. I\u2019ve seen 4 people sharing a one bedroom apartment that\u2019s the size of my bedroom in Dublin. There is room for both siblings and their partners. So either your partner leave or her partner move in.", "i\u2019m gonna say nah. it\u2019s understandable that you wouldn\u2019t want another person living with you, but it\u2019s obvious why your sister would want to have her partner living with her just as you do. i agree with the other commenters\u2014 it might be time to consider moving out. maybe use the reduction in your rent save up and find another place with your girlfriend", "Going against the grain here NTA/ESH. its not exactly 'fair' to her but the three of you all *agreed* to move into this place as just the three of you. She wants to change the status quo and move a fourth person into a cramped apartment. \n\nDoes the landlord know you are not supportive of this move? Given its a family friend etc he probably just okayed it and didnt give it much thought.", "NTA, your sister is being sneaky doing this shit behind your back. Thr place isn't big enough for 4 and you got there first. I'd bring up the issues you've mentioned here with your sister, his attitude when it's already not his place doesn't bode well for future harmony. I predict that you will move out if he moves in. I'd also contact the landlord and raise your objections as this was never agreed with you. Of the answer is...no lease...tough shit...then just give notice and mention how a consultation would have been nice.", "Unless your girlfriend is moving out, it\u2019s unfair to think that only you and her can benefit from the apartment.", "One roommate arbitrarily bringing in another person without discussing it with the other people who already live there isn\u2019t an AH move because it\u2019s their boyfriend?", "because the three of them agreed to that at the time?? And shes trying to change the terms of the agreement", "See, you've made your post deliberately misleading so YTA for that on its own really", "It sounds like OP was just expecting the sister to move out at some point and have the cheap rent to themselves so I have to ask what the catalyst event that they saw changing this living arrangement was. Engagement? A raise? Both neccessary to justify and afford no sister living there? Valid complaint, too many people- but all good things come to an end and it is a majorly unfair complaint to the sibling moving in at the same time who was 3rd wheel for 1.5 years. Honestly sounds like NY isn\u2019t the right place for this couple as with them saving so much already and living together so long a larger place of their own is the logical next step which is\u2026unattainable? Majority rules kinda but also it\u2019s a privilege to live there and the sister and SO have no complaints so. If you\u2019ve been living together 1.5 years (so likely together for 2-4 years) it\u2019s time to discuss living alone together anyways, right?", "so she\u2019s paying more than the two of you and yet she doesn\u2019t have a say? You pay 35% and so does your girlfriend. \nYTA.", "That actually depends on if you and your GF already got the master bedroom and possibly an ensuite bathroom. If you get a larger room, then it can be perfectly valid that you continue to pay more of the rent. The only thing that should definitely become 50/50 is the utilities", "NTA because she didn't discuss this with you beforehand she went directly to the landlord. Also because her bf comes in makes a mess then leaves it for someone else to clean then commandeers the whole living room with no respect for the fact that there are other people that live there and he does not. but i dont really think you have any choice in the matter except to see if your family friend has another apartment or find another one. this is something you wont win on", "ESH. Your sister has just as much right to have her boyfriend there as you do. If you want cheap rent, you will just have to suck it up. The only thing you can do is insist that your sister's boyfriend do his share of cleaning and that he can't live like a slob. Rules are important is such a confined space. \n\nIf the second couple works from home, they should do their food prep and cleanup before you get home. You have equal rights to all common spaces.  He doesn't get to take over the tv.\n\nMany people living in a small space is doable for the sake of saving money if everyone follows house rules and respects others. We once lived 10 young, working adults in a small 3 bedroom house with only one bathroom. Everyone was given a 15 minute time slot to shower . Thank goodness we had slightly different schedules and were able to make it work. \n\nIf you are lucky, your sister and her BF will break up soon or move elsewhere once they get the chance to find something else.", "NTA.  Tell your sister the truth.  Your apartment isn't big enough to share between 4 people and if she did move in with her SO, it would ruin your relationship and you would hate for that to happen.  That is the fact, with the slobby SO a second round of ammunition if needed.  Sometimes 'No' is the answer.  Apologize for the situation and try to help her find an alternative.", "Yta based on what's good for the goose, is good for the gander. \n\nYou'll have to implement schedules and rules, ie:\n\nLiving room schedules if it is truly too small to all occupy at the same time. Specifically when you and your GF come home from work and settle y'all should be able to get an hour or two in the living room as they WFH and have free access all day \n\nHe needs to understand in small spaces picking up after himself within a timely fashion is imperative. Like cook and eat but once done eating clean up his mess, not leave it till the next day or whatever so that the facilities and utensils are readily available for others. \n\nMaybe have a once a month meeting as a family (he is family op, as he and your sister are committed) to iron out any wrinkles in the dynamic without animosities brewing", "Is he planning to pay his share of rent and bills? I'm assuming it's currently split 3 ways, so would him moving in split it 4 ways now? If it's split 50/50 with you and your girlfriend only paying half, then yes, it's totally fair for your sister to move in her boyfriend, but split three ways is more of a gray area....\n\nDid your sister ask or just tell you it's happening?\n\nCan you and your girlfriend just move out? \n\nFrom what's been said about the boyfriend being messy and rude, I'm going to tentatively say NTA, but it's really close to ESH. Your sister should be asking, not telling, and it sounds like he's a shitty person to live with, but it also sounds like it is only really fair if your sister can also move someone in since your girlfriend lives with you (depending on how costs are split)\n\nBest scenario is you and your girlfriend just move out. No drama that way. Your sister gets what she wants, you and your girlfriend get the peace you want, no relationships are damaged, and you don't have to live with a slob....", "YTA.

Fine for you to live with your girlfriend in that apartment. But now your sister can't do the same.", "Give us an update !!!", "NAH it\u2019s reasonable for your sister to want her bf to move in when your girlfriend lives there, fair even. While you mention too crowded for 4 what I pick up on is more of how he is an inconsiderate and incompatible roommate. Up until now he has been coming and treating it as entirely his home and you have accommodated him because he is a guest and it was temporary. At a minimum you need to have a roommates meeting one with your sister first about your concerns regarding him moving in and then deciding how to bring their concerns to him. It\u2019s possible he is willing and he is certainly able to clean up after himself. Agreements like the common space isn\u2019t used to wfh during certain times, even a schedule for which nights which roommates have access to the living room tv etc. This may work with rules structure and a schedule.", "YTA. Your post is very misleading, you made it sound like it\u2019s just you and your girlfriend living there but your sister also lives there.

I can't believe the number of folks saying it's \"unfair\" he can have his girlfriend there but she can't have her bf.... This is a housing/landlord tenant situation, and life isn't fair. Even if there's not a written lease there's an oral contract and they didn't consent for it to be changed! \n\nNot to mention like... Yes they have benefited from cheap rent. That doesn't automatically mean that sister should get the same benefits because faaaaaaiiirrnnesss. If op and gf were ready to move in before she and her new bf, that means they get to take advantage of some opportunities that existed then but DON'T now!", "Why was that NOT mentioned at ALL in the post, except in a roundabout, completely indirect way? \n\nAlso, you're subletting for cheap from a family friend, so why do only you and your girlfriend get to benefit from this, and not your sister and her boyfriend? If your bedroom can house a couple, why can't your sisters'?", "Can I ask what gives you the right to have your partner in your apartment but your sister can\u2019t have her partner in her apartment?\n\nNot being sarcastic here, just genuinely asking. I\u2019m sure it feels inconvenient and cramped to have your sister\u2019s partner in the apartment. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if your sister felt the same way about your partner.\n\nNot to mention it feels awkward as hell being the third wheel. I can\u2019t imagine living with a couple and constantly being the third wheel. Your sister has just as much a right as you do to have a partner living with her.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair that only one gets to benefit from the reduced rent. You should be grateful rent is reduced in the first place.\n\nYour sister wants to bring her BF over and she has every right to do it. Tbh the only reason she has the right to do it is bc the landlord is trying to benefit you BOTH as you both are friends of the family. Therefore it\u2019s not fair to favor one over the other.\n\nI would also like to add that it\u2019s NYC. And as a New Yorker\u2026 there\u2019s no room anywhere. Rent will always be expensive. You will have to make sacrifices like space and privacy for the sake of having cheaper rent. I would think of this more as a roommates situation.\n\nYour sister sucked it up for over a year. Now it\u2019s your turn. You get to have a life in your apartment, and so should she. You are the only one with a problem here. That means you either (a) suck it up, or (b) leave. Up to you.", "You might want to state that in your post.", "Goes exactly the same for OP's girlfriend, so in that case OP has been the AH for as long as she's lived there.\n\n~~And before you go \u201cBut that was probably discussed before they moved in!\u201d: Yeah, and so is the sister opening the discussion now, so where do you get \u201carbitrarily bringing in another person without discussing it\u201d?!?~~\n\nAh, duh \u2013 after rereading OP I got that. Yeah, perhaps a bit abrupt... But still, only fair. He's had his GF there for 18 months; Sis' turn now. If the place is too cramped for four, GF gets to go.", "If it\u2019s not breaking the lease, then it\u2019s not an AH move", "He didn\u2019t post that in the original post. OP made it seem like it was just him and his gf living there. And his sister was trying to move in her bf", "And she'd be fully right to hold it against you.", "And wouldn\u2019t they split that between them meaning they each pay 30% while she\u2019s paying 40%.

And that is fair to you? In what world man. OP and GF have been together 5 years, that's planning your whole future together status. Sister and her BF haven't even been together a solid year (they broke up in the middle- timer starts over as far as I'm concerned when that happens. Especially since they broke up for months). What happens if your plan happens, kick out gf move in bf, then they break up again? This isn't even to mention the rude ways the bf has been show to act when he does \"share\" the space", "Not even \u201call things\u201d \u2014 if _OP_ were fair, he'd do that. But he won't, because he isn't.", "Feels like the word \u201cinitially\u201d is doing an awful lot of work there.", "Because that makes NO SENSE. WHY is everyone in these comments advocating for the COMPLETELY INNOCENT gf to get kicked out of her home? She also pays rent. She moved in at the same time. Regardless of anything with the sisters bf, WHY would you screw over the gf? Because you think op is a meanie? Jesus christ", "If you have a problem with it, why don\u2019t you move?", "So, you've been enjoying living with your GF for quite a while. Isn't it Sis\u2019s turn now? Fairest solution is, if the flat is only big enough for three, your GF leaves.", "What is this line of thinking? This makes zero sense. Screwing over someone who moved in with all parties agreeing for a guy who has not even been with the sister for a year straight? Come on, get real", "My thoughts on it would be that given its her that's changing the status quo that if there's adjustment needed it should be on her part. Not fair for anyone to make such a big desicion without even consulting the other house members.", "So you were just going to expect her to stay single forever? Why is it that only you get to benefit from reduced rent?\n\nI would argue that you affected the status quo first. The family friend offer was given to you and your sister, not your GF. Your GF isn\u2019t a friend of the landlord.\n\nShe only gets cheaper rent bc she\u2019s dating you. You and your sister are at a time of growing and changing. Does she not deserve a life with a partner (like you\u2019ve had for a year and a half by now)?", "NTA", "Nta. I feel I would have to speak up and be blunt how you feel. Why has her perspective changed. Why didn't she come discuss with you guys. If willing to try what firm boundaries you have. Sucks! Best of luck.", "NTA. This is a recipe for disaster. Don't allow it.", "YTA. Your post is deliberately misleading.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re really clinging to the technicality of you three moving in at the same time so you all agreed to the original living conditions. \n\nYou\u2019re still an asshole though because it\u2019s only fair for her to have her significant other living with her if you\u2019re allowed the same. You couldn\u2019t have reasonably expected her to stay single forever.\n\nIt is technically correct for someone to not split an inheretence from an abusive parent between their siblings.  But that does make them an asshole in some cases.  Same thing here.  You\u2019re technically within your rights of the original agreement to deny him moving in, but you\u2019re still an asshole.", "You are NTA but your sister kind of is for putting you in this position. She is trying to change your living arrangement to something really uncomfortable. I would put my foot down and say absolutely not.", "Additional information needed. Will rent be split 50/50 now? Has there been any conversations in the past or since about her wanting a boyfriend move in. Discussion needs to be had.", "Wow.  Flat out tell her that another person is not welcome - in writing with both of you signing it.  If she us not the leaseholder, I would  change the locks before she returns.  But, legally, it may come down to whoever is on the lease making the decision.  Also, does the lease  say how many people are permitted?", "I would say this sucks but you have nothing in writing so this is 100% up to the landlord.  So, NAH, but you may very well be screwed.  I'm from NY so I can only say...good luck.", "INFO \n\nHave YOU talked to the landlord??\n\nDoes the landlord know that YOU and your GIRLFRIEND don't want a 4th  person in the apartment??\n\nCan you and your gf afford to pay for the place just the two of you???", "YTA", "So your sister planned with her bf for him to move in without speaking to you and your gf. She spoke to the landlord without speaking to you and your gf. She **told** you that he'd be moving in.\n\nNTA all day everyday. As soon as it became a discussion btwn her and her bf, you and your gf should have been included. You need to talk to the landlord and make sure that they're actually ok with it, and they know you're not ok with it. Considering how your sister has gone about this, she probably preemptively told them you and your gf don't mind.", "NTA - everyone who currently lives there has to agree to an additional person\u2026. Why would you want to live with a slob", "NTA... but discuss this with property owner. \n\nINFO: Do you have the right to say no to others living there? \n\nGet the rental details in writing.

But it looks like the good times are over.", "You need to have a talk with the landlord and tell him you are not ok with him moving in. She didn\u2019t even ask she just demanded.

The family friend offering the cheap rent discount offered it to you and your sister, so she should get the same benefits as you.\n\nWIth respect to the living situation, you should establish some ground rules about:\n\n1) Clean-up of the kitchen/living room/bathroom spaces after each use\n\n2) Consider alternating the nights that each couple gets to use the living room such as three nights for each couple (alternating the nights), and one night shared with everyone.\n\nGood luck.", "I truly believe OP has the right to move out now and sister has no right to complain.

Another person in a small apartment is a big difference..", "OP, the sister, and gf all moved in together at the same time. They all agreed to the living situation before hand", "Except it\u2019s probably already uncomfortable that way for her?", "I assume rent would of course have to be split. No discussions held at all. The opposite in fact in that she said he wasn't ever going to move in cos thr place wasn't big enough", "How are you splitting the rent/utilities?", "lmao wait you're going 60/40 and trying to control your sis? She's paying more in rent than you bruh. This just keeps getting worse.", "In this case yes. Because OP already has a guest there that lowers the sister's quality of living. It's only fair she's allowed to bring her partner over. They're in the same situation. Either both are allowed to have their partner over or neither is. OP is not special", "He also left out that the rent split is idiotic and favors  him.\n\nThe current split is 60/40:\n- OP: 30%\n- GF: 30%\n- Sister: 40%\n\nAs a fellow NYer, grow tf up - most of us learned how to live with multiple people in shoe boxes, and yall are complaining abt this?", "Sounds like you gaslit your poor sister.

It's legal for me to wash out the stinky garbage bin only on days when my neighbours have a BBQ.

Living with someone is a huge step, and starting off with creating tension isn't going to make it an easier transition. The sister set this whole thing up for failure by going above everyone's head. Tension is killer. \n\n\nI'm not saying the sister is unimportant, I am saying it is remarkably silly to kick out the gf in favor of the bf. By your own logic, is ops girlfriend less important than the bf? Why? And that's not what gaslighting is, this is just a difference of opinion. My opinion is that the GF shouldn't get kicked out to make room for someone that hasn't even been around that long", "She could just as easily tell you to move out or move your gf out.  Sorry.", "i don\u2019t get why you can\u2019t sit in the living room just cause he\u2019s there too. each couple has their own bedroom, yes the bathroom situation might be a little hard but i don\u2019t see any other issues", "Yup, sounds like the cheap rent party is over.", "Unfortunately for you, you don\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on. You\u2019ve got no official lease and a landlord who already agreed to a 4th moving in. Your sister has just as much rights as you do here, so it\u2019s time to face reality and make it work. Schedule a roommate meeting and set guidelines about expectations for all living together peacefully. If you can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s time for you to move out."]}
