In fact the opposite was... there's been a few periods when he'd come over and stay for a week+ in a row and we'd had conversations how the place wasn't that big and was very cramped when he stayed over for more than a coupe days.

You make it sound like it's just you and your gf living there, but it's you, your gf and your sister.\n\nAnyway, you and your sister are both living in a rental apartment with family bonus (cheap rent). That family bonus is an important key factor. \n\nThe owners of the apartment presumably has the same relationship to you and your sister, so they want to treat you both the same way. \n\nYou had the option to get the family bonus for yourself and your gf. Now your sister wants the exact same conditions, family bonus for herself and her bf.\n\nI get that this impacts your living quality, but at the same time, your gf has impacted your sisters living quality in a similar way. If your gf had not been there, it would have been only you and your sister, and the apartment would have been even less crowded.\n\nThe only difference between you and your sister is that she wants to change status quo, whereas you have always had the double family bonus. I don't think \"first come first serve\" is fair in this situation. Why would you and your gf get a cheap apartment from your family friend, but your sister is second in line and has to rent one for regular price? That's not fair.\n\nIf the apartment is really too crowded, a good compromise would be to find a comparable one for one couple and split the cost of both rents. So that both couples have equal family bonus. \n\nAs of now, I say YTA, because I don't think you have the right to complain", "YTA. Your post is deliberately misleading as your sister lives in the apartment too. It\u2019s not fair that you are able to live their with your partner but your sister isn\u2019t. The landlord is ok with it so if you don\u2019t like it then move. It\u2019s not your property and you don\u2019t have a lease so you can\u2019t dictate who gets to live there", "So how are you not the asshole when you already got your gf living in a space where maybe your sister didn\u2019t want to share with an extra person?", "ESH - you make it sound like it's just you and your GF living alone, but it's you and your GF in 1 room and your sister also living with you in the other room. It's as much her place as it is yours and she's already cleared it with the person who really gets to have a say in the decision, the landlord. \n\nI will say, you should have been the phone call before the landlord and it should have included a discussion and plan of action; it definitely sounds like she sprung this on you without much notice and probably is aware that it's been cramped when he's stayed over previously so will definitely be a big transition which will impact both you and your GF. \n\nYou can say that you don't want him moving in but it won't really solve much since it sounds like it's already a done deal and will most likely just cause tension right off the bat (if you think it's not done and that your sister might actually understand, go for it, but your post doesn't make it sound that way). \n\nYour options really are to make the best of it (probably should sit down and try to figure out solutions to anything you considered a problem from when he has stayed there previously, while keeping in mind that this will be an adjustment for him as well and that he deserves to be able to settle in, so grace is need on both sides) or start looking for a new place asap. Maybe start by discussing with your GF and seeing what she thinks would be the best course of action.", "INFO This all depends on whose on the lease etc. Who\u2019s on the lease, who\u2019s paying what portion of the rent and what was the original situation?", "Question: where you living together when your girlfriend moved in? And how was it treated - did you also just tell your sister your girlfriend was moving in and you'd already checked with the landlord or was there more of a back and forth?", "INFO: Do you have a lease? Does your sister pay half the rent or 1/3rd?", "So you, your GF and your sister all live in this apartment. It's ok for you to have your GF live there but not your sisters BF. YTA. Why do you get to have a live in partner and she doesn't? Did you discuss it with her before your GF moved in?", "NTA, you're not the one driving the wedge, it's your sister trying to tell you, not ask you, to move someone else into your apartment.  You need to not wait but get back in touch with her immediately and tell her absolutely not, the place is too small for that, and you will not entertain it any further.  If she says she's doing it anyway, you'll need to contact the owner and tell them this was not discussed with you and is not ok with you.", "NTA- should have been discussed prior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should have asked, and not just talked to the landlord. \"Hi Sister Name, I'm sorry, but having another roommate just isn't possible for us right now. BF will need to find a different living situation.\" And yes, she'll call and demand to know why, and you don't have to explain. But if you want to, tell her that it wouldn't be healthy for your relationship with your gf at this time. And don't get into fights, don't get into arguments, just say no. NTA", "NTA for feeling like the apartment will be too cramped for four of you.  I would have that conversation with you sister and say that you understand her wanting to live with her boyfriend,  but that will end up crowding you and your gf out, so you both plan on moving out by a certain date.", "Yes, lol. It's a 2 bed apt.1 room me and my gf live in and she has the other. There's another room which has a kitchen/living room/utility grouped into 1.", "Have you confirmed with the landlord that it\u2019s actually ok with him?", "If I say no, it may cause problems in their relationship. Either might cause her to move out or to then hold it against me.", "I, too, am annoyed at OP for making it sound in the opening like it's just him and his gf in a 2-bedroom apartment.\n\nOP, you, your sister, and your girlfriend need to have a sit-down conversation about all of this - that you don't want another person in the place and then what changes need to be made if she insists (expense split, for example). You should also be prepared to find another place or try to push your sister out. Start with a talk between you three about your sister's proposal. I think that's how I would treat it at the moment - she has proposed that her boyfriend move in with you all.", "Original situation was we all moved in together and had an agreement with the landlord that the 3 of us would split the rent 60/40 with me and my gf paying 60%. No official iap lease as its a cash in hand situation", "Not an official one. We pay in cash to the landlord. Its a 60/40 split in rent with us paying the 60%.", "The 3 of us moved in together at the same time. I had discussed with her a while back about how the place was cramped as her bf was staying there for several days in a row WFH and not going back to his own place. She agreed before that the place was cramped and she wasn't looking for him to move in. Agree if all things were fair he should be allowed move which I wouldn't object to but there's just limited space and we'd be on top of each other if there were 4 of us there.", "OP\u2019s sister lives there too, OP doesn\u2019t have a lease and the landlord agreed. I think it\u2019s not that straight forward. I do think this should\u2019ve been discussed beforehand.", "The post is misleading. It's the apartment of OP AND his sister. Op gets cheap rent for himself + partner and his sister wants the same conditions. I think it's fair that both siblings get the chance to profit from the cheap rent in the same way, since it's only cheap due to family connection.", "Thank you, that's how I was feeling but it's a tough one to broach without causing a fight. Conversation needed obviously", "Who all is on the lease? When you moved in was your partner agreed upon or?", "You might have misread this one, they asked how could you not be the asshole here", "Boyfriend moves in and rent changes to 50/50\n\nEdit: Otherwise you would be YTA. Sister would be the YTA if she refuses to the adjusted rent .", "Well, I definitely wouldn't be paying 60% anymore if you are all sharing. Hate to say it, but without a lease and it IS someone else's home...but sucks to be in your position. Is it already a tight fit?", "If all things were fair you would ask your GF to move out so her BF could move in for the same amount of time your GF was there", "So what if she lives there too?  That contradicts nothing I said - she's trying to move someone else in without asking them.  Normally when you lease a place, to change those terms, everyone has to agree.  \n\nIf the sister wants to move someone else in, she needed to ask.  And if the landlord says they're not interfering, OP should tell them then we'll have no choice but to move out, and tell the sister that if you force us to move out, that will be the last time we speak for a long time if ever, because you don't get to just throw my life on the fire for your own wants.", "Have you confirmed with the landlord that it\u2019s actually ok with him?", "Yep, sorry you're dealing with it, but not your fault, it's gonna be an unpleasant conversation because your sister seemingly doesn't mind making your lives very uncomfortable.  She should have discussed this idea with you before bringing it up with the BF or landlord, and any considerate person would know this - she is trying to force you, and that's the cause of the conflict.", "It's not an official lease so that's where it's a bit blurry. When we moved in we agreed with the landlord that we'd pay a fixed amount (in cash) every month but yes it was agreed that the 3 of us would move in together initially and all moved in at the same time.", "Haha that's for sure! Yea it's perfectly fine for 3 ppl and we all have our own routines that work well together but with 4 we'd be completely on top of each other", "That\u2019s a lot of hypotheticals which don\u2019t apply to the current situation. The landlord is doing him a favor and does agree with a fourth person moving in. Also, there\u2019s no lease. Of course OP can decide to move out and not talk to his sister. But that would be totally on him.", "You don\u2019t have much ground to stay on if you don\u2019t have a lease and your landlord agrees. She should have discussed it beforehand but if you can share your room with your GF, is it so unreasonable to want to share her room with her partner?", "No I completely understand that and she should absolutely be entitled to. If the place was bigger and we wouldn't end up so on top of each other I'd have no issue but I get ya with the lack of lease. Was always going to end up causing issues \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "ESH you can't have your gf live with you, then deny your sister having her bf move in. She sucks because rather than talk with you first, she dropped it on you.. but she probably knew you'd say no if asked. \nTime to look for a new place mate"]}
