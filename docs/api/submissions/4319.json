{"id": 4319, "submission_id": "zgvzfc", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my father and his wife money that my father saved for me before he met her?", "selftext": "My father married his wife when I was 12, four years after my mom died from cancer. My father's wife had a 3 year old daughter who a year into their marriage was diagnosed with a form of cancer that is tricky to treat. She underwent chemo and radiation but the treatment did not work. They were told about this alternative treatment that was not offered in any local hospital and it would require staying someplace else for at least three months with her. The treatment itself was also expensive. My father was never wealthy, neither was his wife and her daughter's father and his family were not in her life. There was only one thing that was easily sold and would make enough money to get started on the journey and that was my mom's engagement ring. It left to me, in her will, and was mine. Before my mom it was her mother and grandmother's ring. My great-grandparents helped someone out and it was a gift that was then passed down because of its value. It was extra sentimental because my grandma was in a nursing home with dementia at the time and I had no other living maternal family left. My father decided that could be sold to pay for the treatment. I said no, I begged him not to, he and his wife told me her daughter's life was more important and that it would be selfish to keep a ring and let her die. I told my father I would never forgive him if he sold the ring and that he was stealing from me, because it was mine. He went ahead and sold it anyway and I stayed true to my word. I never forgave them.\n\nI moved out in March, before turning 18, and cut them out of my life. I still hate the two of them and wanted nothing more to do with them again. My father tried to stay in my life but I told him I hoped he knew he lost his daughter (me) and that I wish it had been him to die instead of my mom.\n\nHis wife's daughter's cancer has returned and now they want money that my dad saved for me before he married her. It's not a lot of money at all. But I guess they still have lingering stuff from when she was sick before. I told him I would not give him the money and the fact he would ask for it showed that he didn't give a shit about me. His wife told me that it's not about me, it's about saving her daughter's life and me being hung up on losing a ring that went on to save the life of a child. I told her that ring meant more to me than they did and that I would not give them any money, so they needed to leave me alone and figure out another plan. My father's parents got involved and I ended up deleting most of my social media and ignoring them. But then I saw my father's wife while I was grabbing groceries and she told me I'm evil and sick and twisted and I should be ashamed of myself.\n\nI don't know if it's all just worn me down or what but I feel like I need to ask, AITA?\n\nEdited to fix some errors.\n\nETA: After some thinking and reading a lot of comments I have decided they can have the money and I am going to make it clear that I never want to hear from any of them again. If nothing else I need him to do that much. The relationship is done but the money can be theirs.", "created_utc": 1670588708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgvzfc/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_father_and_his_wife/", "score": 9141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was only one thing that was easily sold and would make enough money to get started on the journey and that was my mom's engagement ring. It left to me, in her will, and was mine. Before my mom it was her mother and grandmother's ring. My great-grandparents helped someone out and it was a gift that was then passed down because of its value. It was extra sentimental because my grandma was in a nursing home with dementia at the time and I had no other living maternal family left. My father decided that could be sold to pay for the treatment. I said no, I begged him not to, he and his wife told me her daughter's life was more important and that it would be selfish to keep a ring and let her die. I told my father I would never forgive him if he sold the ring and that he was stealing from me, because it was mine. He went ahead and sold it anyway and I stayed true to my word. I never forgave them.\n\nI moved out in March, before turning 18, and cut them out of my life. I still hate the two of them and wanted nothing more to do with them again. My father tried to stay in my life but I told him I hoped he lost his daughter and that I wish it had been him to die instead of my mom.\n\nHis wife's daughter's cancer has returned and now they want money that my dad saved for me before he married her. It's not a lot of money at all. But I guess they still have lingering stuff from when she was sick before. I told him I would not give him the money and the fact he would ask for it showed that he didn't give a shit about me. His wife told me that it's not about me, it's about saving her daughter's life and me being hung up on losing a ring that went on to save the life of a child. I told her that ring meant more to me than they did and that I would not give them any money, so they needed to leave me alone and figure out another plan. My father's parents got involved and I ended up deleting most of my social media and ignoring them. But then I saw my father's wife while I was grabbing groceries and she told me I'm evil and sick and twisted and I should be ashamed of myself.\n\nI don't know if it's all just worn me down or what but I feel like I need to ask, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nobody could control you losing your mom, but your dad is making choices that are so manipulative and \"I value you because you have resources I want, now give me the resources.\" It's impossible to foster a healthy relationship with someone who behaves like that.

I would maybe sell them if I had financial issues\u2026. But I have one thing you don\u2019t, 20+ years of memories with them.

He stole the one physical possession that connects you to the mom that was healthy. That mom had you and had dreams of watching you grow up and giving you that ring when you were older. Not only did he steal something willed to you, but he took the only thing that gave you a physical connection to her for some money. If that ring had been totally worthless, he would\u2019ve found another way to get that money, so why did he have to take your one and only heirloom of your moms just because it was worth a high enough $ value?

Listen, my son spent the first 5 years of his life in and out of hospital. We almost lost him a few times. My heart goes out to the parents, it really does. However, my in-laws left several heirlooms to my stepsons that would fully cover his medical expenses. It crossed our minds to sell them (I'm not proud of it), but neither me or my husband could do it. We did sell some things they left my husband, I sold heirlooms left to me by my grandparents.

There are other ways. If my child said no i would understand them and come up with something else.\n\nI MAY be biased because i have my nana's watch and wouldn't give it up at all.

I do NOT talk to them now, the emotional cost is high i don't understand why my mum still talks to them.\n\nI don't agree with people saying sue them, theres no point now, it won't get the ring back.

It would be fine for you to offer to help them financially if you felt compelled to do so. \n\nDon\u2019t let guilt internalize you into a greedy or selfish person. Your feelings and needs matter.

I'm guessing a couple hundred dollars max. When I looked at selling my engagement ring, I didn't bother cause I could only get a small fraction of the purchase price.

Undifferentiated sarcoma of the lung. All the doctors, and there were so many, said she wouldn't survive to see kindergarten. My other sister and I lived with babysitters for weeks at a time while mom was at the hospital with her. When we got chicken pox I didn't even see my mom for almost a month because it could have killed my sister. When she was home from the hospital, we couldn't do anything or go anywhere because she could have died if someone sneezed around her. One day, on a rare occasion that she wasn't in PICU, mom took us to visit her in between chemo and radiation treatments. Mom was outside talking to her doctor about something and I, a 7yo child, told my 3yo sister that I wished she'd hurry up and die so that mom would have time to love me again. Mom and the doctor just happened to walk back in the room right as I said that and I got in sooo much trouble, but even I could tell that it wasn't because I had done something wrong, but because I laid down a hard fucking truth and she was ashamed and angry at having it thrown in her face by a child. \n\nI will give her credit though, because after that she made huge efforts to include the rest of us more. We got to go visit my sister with her. She started coming home at night so we didn't have live with the babysitters for 2 or 3 weeks at a time. When it was summer vacation, she took us with her when my sister had to be transferred across the state for special treatments. We stayed with her at the RMH. We got to know our sister again. They didn't expect her to make it to her 6th birthday, but 30 years later and she's still kicking and is probably my favorite sister. She has a lot of health problems but, as she says, the last 30 years have all been borrowed time so there's no point in worrying about it and if it's her time, it's her time.
