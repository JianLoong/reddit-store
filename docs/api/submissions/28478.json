You don't have to  turn all the money over to him but at the same time it would be nice to determine what he needs to get started in his trade and use the money to help him with that.   Without knowing what he trained for it's hard to say but as an example some trades require you to have your own tools, some have a lower paid apprenticeship even after schooling is done.  You could consider these things as part of his education and an investment towards his future career.

He may decide to attend college or specific education such as accounting, to complement his skills in his trade and learn how to manage things if he starts his own business.  \n\nAnd if he does start his own business in his trade, he may need some seed money to get started.\n\nAs a parent, don't just keep the money to punish him.

He strictly could have said \"trades isn't college, it's not a degree\" and held onto his money.

But if the money isn't being used for its intent then I feel those people would be kinda shafted..if a gift is given on terms, intent \"use the money for this\" it comes with the good will and intent to be used for that purpose, anything outside of that is a bit of a slap in the face. \n\nLike if the son took the money and simply went on a Vegas trip and blew it all gambling, drinking or a crappy holiday, buying the latest Xbox... instead of a degree, I'd question it. It's a question of helping that person get a start, build on and Invest in themselves and help them grow Vs anything else they do that they can manage themselves in life.
