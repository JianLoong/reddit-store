He may decide to attend college or specific education such as accounting, to complement his skills in his trade and learn how to manage things if he starts his own business.  \n\nAnd if he does start his own business in his trade, he may need some seed money to get started.\n\nAs a parent, don't just keep the money to punish him.

OP is paying for his sons choice of education.\nAny money left over belongs to OP.", "That's completely reasonable.  It sounded like you only paid for part of the trade school so I apologize.  It might be nice if you gifted him the tools he needs for his trade, and I love Smooth Contact's idea of business classes.  If he does go into business for himself, it might be nice if you pay for his initial consultation with a good accountant.  Too many folks set up businesses BEFORE getting the necessary advice.\n\nMost important thing is to let him know you are proud of him and respect his choice.", "We don't know what trade he went into but most trade schools are more than a year. Shit, even cosmetology school is a minimum 18 months in my state \ud83d\ude02", "A college fund to better himself in the future", "A house isn\u2019t expensive ?", "True, but expecting the parent that was gonna pay for your \"further education [college]\" to pay for \"further education [trade school]\" is not entitlement", "Op never said he's kid wanted the money for a house? He might want them so he could buy beer and play blackjack.", "I never said it wasn\u2019t. What I said is that he put away for a specific expensive purpose. He did not put away for the child\u2019s general future, but a specific piece as helping with college is something many parents do. \n\nThe kid is acting like it\u2019s his money and he\u2019s entitled to it. It was never his, though. It was always his dad\u2019s money and continues to be. The kid isn\u2019t entitled to his father\u2019s money.", "Fair comment"]}
