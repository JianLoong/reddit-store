I asked why and she said that they will not be able to eat anything from the menu after looking at it. I said I was sorry but there isn't enough space at the table for extra meals and besides that the kids should start learning to be more tolerant to some foods, especially at family holiday gathering where it's expected for everyone to just eat what's infront of them without complaining. She went on about how difficult kids can be (mostly can't relate but I get it! but still, she should keep in mind that it's probably a passing phase for them and so sucking it up for one dinner wouldn't affect them. She said that I don't get it and that she doesn't want them to stay hungry or feed on snacks. I apologized and declined.\n\n\nMy husband got involved in this and is saying I'm being inconsiderate towards my guests. he said I lose nothing by allowing them to bring food but I disagree because this was not part of my plans. and if anything this should be a teachable moment for the kids to know that they can't expect to be catered for all the time. he got more upset told me that his sister is heavily reconsidering coming to a celebratory dinner where her kids weren't allowed to bring their own food.

Your excuse that there isn't enough space on the table is laughable. They don't have to set up huge platters of whatever they're eating; they can just take their individual portions on a plate and leave the serving dish somewhere nearby, like the kitchen.
