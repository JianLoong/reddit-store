(The driveway is parallel to our grassy patch). We agreed to it, thinking this a one time thing. They started doing it constantly but the street parking is limited and chalked it up to a misunderstanding. I wasn't trying to start a feud with my neighbor over something so small.\n\nHowever, a few of our fedex packages, were mis-delivered (we filed a complaint and it's fine now). One was a very expensive cat prescription that was missing for two weeks before the neighbor brought it over. I saw this on our ring camera. I started to wonder about the other missing packages and if they kept them. All were cat items - they have 5 cats. My ring also caught her taking a package off my porch and telling the ring cam it was hers. I didn't have a package schedule that day so I didn't think anything about it until all this.\n\nThen I noticed other trash in my bin, sometimes filling it up that I wouldn't have room for my stuff. Then one day, I noticed they had bags of trash in their yard, and couldn't fit it all in their bin. The bags were black and matched the one being dumped in my bin. I even saw him headed toward my bin, when he saw me and went to another neighbors bin and dumped trash.\n\nWithin the last month or so, they've used the spot to put their garbage bins. The last two years they've been on the other side of their yard and have just appeared. They've even pushed their bins against our garage.\n\nIt bothered me a little they were taking so many liberties, but not enough to say something because it's so small.\n\nHowever, 2 days ago, I found cardboard layered across my lawn. Completely covering the grass. Not a stack, or messy dumping, but like an intentional nice, shingled overlay of boxes. I had also notice 3 baby pools full of gravel.\n\nAt best, they were leaving trash on the land it let them use. At worst, they were try to do some adverse possession shit.\n\nI was so mad. My hubby went to talk to them (he wouldn't let me go). No answer but their cars were there... I tore that shit up, threw it in their bin, went to the store bought roses, mulch and stackable garden edging.\nIt took me 2 hours to finish. Looks great and the edging is about the height of cinder blocks but classy.\n\nSo AITA for putting up a flower bed so they could no longer park there?", "created_utc": 1692020509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qv2oy/aita_for_not_letting_the_minister_neighbors_park/", "score": 734, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
