If you\u2019re going to be at home and you need the shortfall to be made up because the total household income needs to be at a certain place for you all to afford to live then absolutely not the AH.\n\nI think sit down with some figures though explaining this rather than just saying she needs to get a better paid job.", "NTA. Can you sit down with your wife and discuss this? Or see a financial counsellor together? A professional may be able to lay it out plainly for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou're wife is obviously wrong, but she's also obviously ignorant to the fact. Good luck changing her mind.", "Logically, this doesn't make sense so either your wife is dense or she's trying to escape the caring part.\n\nIn order to make it work on her income, you'll have to downsize and reduce the services/care your child with additional needs is receiving. Make that make sense. As a parent, I would never want that if I had a *choice*. This would be an entirely different situation if she was a high earner and could sustain the lifestyle your family is accustomed to.\n\nCrunch some figures and show her the reality; as in, what it will mean practically. If you jeopardize your job, you're also jeopardizing the care your child receives.", "NTA what did I just read! You absolutely do not take unpaid time off that much you won\u2019t have a job soon. I am not sure how your wife thinks she makes enough to support your family when you made 3x what she does.", "Earnings and expenses are objective math, not matters of opinion. If her income isn't enough for your expenses, you are apparently both adults with the ability to do the basic math so you should be able to talk and figure it out. \n\nESH (you only because you are here instead of talking to your wife)", "Have you done a budget and sat down to review it together? Do 3 versions:\n- one with your current jobs (replace unpaid leave with paid care)\n- one with your current jobs with your unpaid leave\n- one with you doing FT care (no work) and her job\n\nThen decide what you can live with and on as a family. Numbers can be abstract for some people, so I\u2019ve found it helps to put things down in writing with clearly defined spending pots.", "Instead of coming to her with the solution you've decided you want her to follow, why don't you talk about the problem together and come up with a solution together, like a partnership?", "The two of you seem to have differing opinions on living standards. She seems fine with her salary for the the entire family, while you expect a higher income to maintain your current living standard. Maybe she's really happy with her job, her tasks and her coworkers and doesn't want to leave because of that. I think the two of you should sit down for a realistic money talk. Crunch the numbers and visualize how your incomes will affect your live over the next 6-12 months: rent/mortgage, groceries, school etc. Some people need some form of visualization to realize things.", "INFO: do you have enough money?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You both need an outlet outside of being a carer but you have to be on the ssme page about expectations. If this lifestyle isn't sustainable on her income alone then things have to change. Please also consider outside help for caring for your child should you need to return to a more time intensive role.", "Build a detailed budget and show cash flows with income scenarios OP\u2026if that doesnt work you have bigger problems", "NTA. Time to sit down with her and do the math. Itemize. Regular bills, expenses and costs. Don't forget retirement planning. Math out the income coming in and what you have left after you pay for everything. The numbers don't lie and may be a wake-up call for her. Sometimes people need to see it for themselves to understand it.", "NAH. Women are often at a massive disadvantage in later life or after divorce etc because their careers have been on hold for many years due to childcare. Your wife may also enjoy being in the workplace more than being the primary cared for your child. These are both valid reasons she may want her chance to be in full time employment, regardless of how much more than her you currently earn. \nIt sounds like your wife is continuing to get promotions and opportunities in her current role despite presumably doing at least half the care for a high input child prior to the recent changes, so it may well be that she is valuing the flexibility and goodwill she has in her current role over the extra money she could earn elsewhere in a likely higher pressure environment where she is new and less likely to get a good response to needing to manage some of her time around your child. In a potentially stressful home life with your child\u2019s needs, she may also just really value the stability of a familiar workplace over the stress of trying to prove herself somewhere new. \nYour concern that you (or she) could be earning significantly more than she currently earns is also valid, particularly if tight finances are causing additional stress in your family. \nIt sounds like you both need to sit down and have a really honest conversation about careers, finances and childcare as it doesn\u2019t sound like this is necessarily a short term situation which will be mostly resolved when your child starts school etc. \nHonestly from your post it sounds like neither of you wants to do more than half of the care for your child, so you need to agree how that can be managed fairly for both of you, and potentially consider whether it would be possible/ helpful to pay a professional carer for some of the time if neither of you really want to dial back your careers.", "Yes, put everything in black and white.  Talk out all the options.  Also you should figure out how you could maybe figure out how to put money in a trust to help your child when they get older.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t understand why OP took such a massive pay cut without having that discussion already. OP, this isn\u2019t about anything but the numbers, if your income reduces by X then your wife\u2019s needs to increase by Y. If she cannot make that happen, then she needs to sort out the care for your son. Not because you aren\u2019t his father, but because you\u2019re keeping your family afloat financially, providing the means for his care.", "> you only because you are here instead of talking to your wife\n\nHoly misandry"]}
