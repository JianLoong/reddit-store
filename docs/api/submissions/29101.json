Good luck changing her mind.", "Logically, this doesn't make sense so either your wife is dense or she's trying to escape the caring part.\n\nIn order to make it work on her income, you'll have to downsize and reduce the services/care your child with additional needs is receiving. Make that make sense. As a parent, I would never want that if I had a *choice*. This would be an entirely different situation if she was a high earner and could sustain the lifestyle your family is accustomed to.\n\nCrunch some figures and show her the reality; as in, what it will mean practically.

You both need an outlet outside of being a carer but you have to be on the ssme page about expectations. If this lifestyle isn't sustainable on her income alone then things have to change. Please also consider outside help for caring for your child should you need to return to a more time intensive role.", "Build a detailed budget and show cash flows with income scenarios OP\u2026if that doesnt work you have bigger problems", "NTA. Time to sit down with her and do the math. Itemize. Regular bills, expenses and costs. Don't forget retirement planning. Math out the income coming in and what you have left after you pay for everything. The numbers don't lie and may be a wake-up call for her. Sometimes people need to see it for themselves to understand it.", "NAH. Women are often at a massive disadvantage in later life or after divorce etc because their careers have been on hold for many years due to childcare. Your wife may also enjoy being in the workplace more than being the primary cared for your child. These are both valid reasons she may want her chance to be in full time employment, regardless of how much more than her you currently earn. \nIt sounds like your wife is continuing to get promotions and opportunities in her current role despite presumably doing at least half the care for a high input child prior to the recent changes, so it may well be that she is valuing the flexibility and goodwill she has in her current role over the extra money she could earn elsewhere in a likely higher pressure environment where she is new and less likely to get a good response to needing to manage some of her time around your child. In a potentially stressful home life with your child\u2019s needs, she may also just really value the stability of a familiar workplace over the stress of trying to prove herself somewhere new. \nYour concern that you (or she) could be earning significantly more than she currently earns is also valid, particularly if tight finances are causing additional stress in your family. \nIt sounds like you both need to sit down and have a really honest conversation about careers, finances and childcare as it doesn\u2019t sound like this is necessarily a short term situation which will be mostly resolved when your child starts school etc. \nHonestly from your post it sounds like neither of you wants to do more than half of the care for your child, so you need to agree how that can be managed fairly for both of you, and potentially consider whether it would be possible/ helpful to pay a professional carer for some of the time if neither of you really want to dial back your careers.", "Yes, put everything in black and white.  Talk out all the options.  Also you should figure out how you could maybe figure out how to put money in a trust to help your child when they get older.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t understand why OP took such a massive pay cut without having that discussion already. OP, this isn\u2019t about anything but the numbers, if your income reduces by X then your wife\u2019s needs to increase by Y. If she cannot make that happen, then she needs to sort out the care for your son. Not because you aren\u2019t his father, but because you\u2019re keeping your family afloat financially, providing the means for his care.", "> you only because you are here instead of talking to your wife\n\nHoly misandry", "No one has considered sitting down with someone to create a budget that details what reality used to be before you quit a very well paying job, what reality is now that you've reduced hours and pay + her salary and just exactly what the risk is if you lose your current job due to her demands.\n\nIt also sounds as if she may be hiding behind her job and job responsibilities as a way to avoid dealing with the realities of caring for a disabled child. Couples counseling could be a place to start and a forum in which to raise those types of topics\n\nNTA but just demanding she get a better paying job is ignoring all of the underlying issues that are at play here.", "Gonna go with NAH since it sounds like your wife isn't fully aware of the current financial implications and their impact on your family. If you've drawn up some budgets to show your wife the new shortfall and she's still insistent that she stay at her current job and not seek a better paying job then she's the AH.\n\nRegardless y'all need to sit down and talk about what career and life changes you both need to make to best support your son and keep the family afloat financially. I can only imagine how difficult it is taking care of a special needs child while trying to balance everything else in life but sometimes that requires a bit more sacrifice. I don't love my job but it pays me well and gives me the flexibility to take care of my family so I stick with it and might be ok with a salary hit moving to work that really interests me when the kids are less dependant. It's just the reality of parenthood if you don't have wealth to fall back on.", "NTA since this sounds to be mostly about math and not your ego. \n\nHave you talked with your wife about this? Have you calculated it with her?", "Nta - have a financial planner sit down with both of you and go over the numbers with her.

But this means our son\u2019s care will be significantly reduced as he\u2019ll be placed into a large special school.\n\nStep 1: if you haven't yet, talk to your boss about if you can realistically expect to keep your job if you keep taking unpaid time off. \n\nStep 2: Schedule a couple of meetings - one with your kid's current school (or provider of whatever education/care they receive) to talk about transitioning out, and another meeting with the public school to talk about the experience your child will receive. \n\nStep 3: schedule some house showings with a real estate agent, or look at some apartments. \n\nThis will be a wake up call for one of you. Either you will be ok with the changes, or she won't be.", "Can you go back to earning your former high salary and use some of that extra money to hire a private caregiver for your son? \n\nHaving someone other than yourself or your wife, come in 1-2 times a week to provide care, should help relieve some of the pressure on both of you.", "Get a free excel rip off and sit down TOGETHER and just put out your finances. Figure out what your minimum earnings need to be in an obvious and JOINTLY CREATED way. She can't accuse you of fudging the numbers if you do it together. And it must help her understand you can't do what she wants. And it's not because of stubbornness.", "Go back to work full time and hiring an in home care giver", "NTA. You should go and get back to work. Look for another job. Sit down with her and discuss how the finances are and what needs to be done", "NTA. She can't demand you take on more care but also ignore the financial responsibility.\n\nThe solution is fairly obviously that you go back to the 3x better paid job and hire help for your kid rather than take a massive pay cut and get in trouble with your boss so you can provide more care.\n\nAlso in general, care is very, draining and damaging to a relationship with a child or family member. It's often better mentally and for your relationship to have hired help. A professional being paid isn't going to get frustrated, upset or feel trapped caring for a child or parent while a family member can very easily get frustrated and feel trapped providing a significant amount of care. A lot of disabled children who see parents fight, bills struggle to be paid and tired parents who never go out can also feel like a heavy burden on their parents. \n\nIf you can get paid bank and can afford in home care for your child, I'd absolutely go that route. That way you're also working on your career, you're progressing, you will get raises and become ever more comfortable.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t know what your child\u2019s diagnosis is, but it\u2019d be logical to *not* take a loss in income unless you\u2019re somewhere that provides full coverage for any medical costs, therapies, equipment, etc. most of the world doesn\u2019t do well by disabled folks, so a large loss in income would concern me.\n\nYour last part about downsizing and your child as a result being given less than they need and deserve is a big yikes. I\u2019m familiar with disability myself and have worked with disabled children. Of the parents I interacted with, very few prioritized the child\u2019s needs. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen to your child. Your child is the priority and more important than a dream job.", "I agree. NTA.", "The new ways in which we discover some of these people putting blame on the man is always surprising"]}
