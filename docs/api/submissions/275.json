So Me(f13) and my mother(F idk) had a fight because of the dumbest reason, really what happened was today after i went out with my friends and there was a lot of walking so of course i was tired, i arrived home at about 8:30pm, and then I went to relax and go on my phone for a bit, my mother was telling me and my sisters (F16 and F9) to go shower but we were not going because, well we were to tired then around 10pm she got mad and went on a rant about a lot of other stuff including how we never listen to her and how even thought she's been telling us to shower we never went, so I tell her okay ill go right now, but she she got all mad, so instead i told her that id wake up early and shower because she cant do anything about it then, her solution is taking away my phone so i don't have an alarm, so now she is gonna wake me up and when i asked if she could wake me up at the time i always wake up, she said no because she thinks in gonna shower during that time, but i always wake up at that specific time, i'm still gonna shower in the morning because i hate when my hair gets dirty, so really, she isn't letting me shower because i didn't shower at the right time, and she's getting mad because i want to shower now, i really am confused about all of this because she never used to do this, but now shes acting all different.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are being up the fact that I was too tired to shower, and I'm sorry for not saying this more accurately, what would be more correct is we pushed it back, like how you want to do something, but not right at that second, in this post I'm more focused on the fact of my mother's punishment: not letting me shower and I don't think I wrote this in but when I said not letting me shower I meant for the week. I'm sorry if this made anyone confused and I'm also sorry if this didn't make sense, I'm not very good at writing and explaining things.", "created_utc": 1667269851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiwc69/aita_for_showering_the_next_morning_even_if_my/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you're old enough to decide when to shower and who hasn't gone to bed dirty occasionally because they were tired? Punishing you by making you be dirty for a week is ridiculous.", "So you and your sisters have ignored your mother, didn't do as you were asked, lay around dirty and stinking up the place and now, at 10pm on a school night no one has had a bath and everyone thinks they can just go tomorrow. \n\nMum now has to try and sort out getting all of you clean around laundry, washing up, her own baths and I'm assuming you even have a decent hot water system. If you don't that just makes things worse. \n\nYou're 13 years old, you are old enough to look after yourself. You don't get to refuse to bath for hours on end and then get upset because your hair is dirty. \nYour hair is dirty because you didn't go for a bath when you were asked to, that's not your mum's fault that's all on you. She's overreacting a bit but I can certainly see why. \n\nAs a mother to teenagers, yeah YTA. Next time go for a bloody bath when you're asked to. It's not always about you.", "You were too tired to take a shower when you got home at 8:30 and still up at 10?  You should have had a shower as soon as you got home then relaxed afterwards.\n\nI'm sympathising with your mother.", "YTA. You were so exhausted from being out having fun that you had to sit around dirty on your arse for an hour and a half and are now complaining. For someone only 13 years old, you are certainly becoming a huge AH. \n\nAnd another thing, pay a bit of attention to your mother. \"idk\" is not an age, it is the ignorant statement of a selfish brat that probably doesn't even know when her mothers birthday is. That would be bad for your 9yo sister, but at 13 is just pathetic.", "If your home is anything like ours, there\u2019s not enough hot water for everyone to get to a shower in the morning within an hour or two. And since the bathroom is also shared, there\u2019s not enough time for each person to get ready.\n\nYour mom asked you guys to get showers tonight. You didn\u2019t. So\u2026.guess no shower until tomorrow night. Natural consequences.\n\nIf you lived at our home, I wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to continue to screw off\u2014I would have stood there, grabbed your hand and led you to the bathroom\u2014but if I had to do that/ask twice, you\u2019d be losing privileges.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Really? You\u2019re too tired to take a shower? Good luck to you and your sisters if showering is such a big ask.", "NTA. A lot of parents have a dominating approach to reering children, but kids are logical and have free will, so it's not a smart method IMO. \n\nThe showering isn't an issue; I can't understand why your mom is so locked onto the issue. I think it has more to do with control; she said to jump, and you didn't say \"how high?\", you said \"I'll jump when I have the energy.\" Taking things away is also a frowned upon punishment; it's purely punitive, it doesn't teach you anything. \n\nYou might relate to the subbreddit r/raisedbynarcissists. I'm sorry for suggesting it if I'm way off base, but it brought me a lot of comfort when I was your age to know I wasn't the only one dealing with a nonsensical and controlling parental figure.", "YTA. Your mom gets to make the rules and the consequences for breaking the rules. If you even want her to consider any sort of compromise, you need to show her you listen and are respectful.", "YTA it shouldn\u2019t be much to ask to shower at a reasonable time as you\u2019re a child, if you know you\u2019re gonna be tired when you come back maybe you should decide to come back earlier because If you think being to tired to shower is bad just wait until you get older and have to get more stuff done. I don\u2019t know your family completely but your mother was in the right for acting the way she did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also when I got home showering wasn't my first priority, it was to check my phone to talk to my friends, I understand that I should've gone shower when I first got home, but I didn't want to do it right when I get home I was more focused on other things so I pushed showering back.", "For the part about me not knowing my mother's age, she hasn't told me and when I bring it up she either tells me some random number or just flat out doesn't tell me any number, it isn't my fault that I don't know her age she just doesn't want to tell me, I do know my mother's birthdate, and I celebrate it every year.", "Yes I do see your point and I do get that, but it's not for just tonight or the next morning it's for until next week, imagine you not showering for a whole week.", "Haven\u2019t you ever procrastinated showering because you were tired?\n\nIf not, you\u2019ve never been that tired.", "The difference being I'm a full grown adult who deals with the consequences of my own laziness on my own. \n\nYours affects a whole household. Again, it's not just you. There's at least 3 other people in your house and 2 of them ALSO did not shower when asked. \n\nThe rest of this answer doesn't really have any bearing on your question but honestly, the only thing i see here that my own kids don't do is the laundry, but mine mow the lawn and do other things.", "As a mother of two teenagers, it's near impossible to get kids up, showered and ready to go to school in the morning.  You really should pay more attention, you're Mum is dealing with 3 kids, not just you.\n\nPlease!!  Start showing some respect and do as she says, when she says it.  She's trying to run a household and you're treating it like a hotel.\n\nAnd yes.  YTA.  Major AH.", "I only shower once a week due to my dermatologists orders, if I shower a lot my eczema gets worse. Sure if I swim or something I may do a quick one, but the idea that humans have to shower every day is so weird. I thought it odd at first but my hair is healthier and my skin is way better than it's ever been. So idk, I get if you are used to it and like to but it won't kill you as long as you keep yourself clean.\n\nA damp cloth and changing clothes daily and stuff goes a long way.\n\nHowever I do think it's odd she wanted you to shower, got mad you didn't and then said you can't for a week. Seems counter intuitive to her original desire.", "If you were \\*that\\* tired, you should have had a shower and gone to bed.  Not eff around to 10pm.", "How does what I do affect the whole house? Like you said I'm not the only one who isn't showering, yes if I shower late it might now let people sleep but I offered a compromise of showering in the morning so it doesn't bother anyone else, or if we had the time to talk I could have done it another day, but she took it all away so id have to wait an entire week.\n\nThat affects me a lot, lets's put it in ur perspective. let's say you don't shower for a week, what's that gonna do? you're gonna be dirty, your hair might be dirty and greasy, and if you had curly hair (I'm not sure if you do or not) it would be a mess and very hard to manage.\n\nAlso if you have a job that you have to go into and look presentable you're gonna want to look presentable, is basically the same thing but for school, I want to look good for school.\n\nI'm also not comparing myself to your kids and I really don't care how you parent but just because I didn't point out one or two things that I do or don't do that your kids also do doesn't mean you have to point it out,  yea I don't mow the lawn but neither does anyone else, I don't have the privilege of having a large yard so it doesn't need mowing.", "I get that it is very hard to raise kids of your own, but the way my mother brought it up, and handled it is what I'm talking about, yes I was being disrespectful, but when she told me she would tell me in a way was that she knew I hated, and if I didn't do it she'd shout and get aggressive, then when I went to do it she wouldn't let me, and now shes punishing me by now letting me shower for the rest of the week, I appreciate how you said that and thank you for telling me about how you think it would be for a mothers point of view.", "I have been that tired and the last thing I want to do is shower. As someone with ADD that takes a lot of mental effort and I\u2019m too tired for that shit in that moment and then cause I have ADD I get distracted on my phone and stay up longer than I should."]}
