I don't really care too much about presents or doing anything special it just would've been nice for her to at least acknowledge that it was my birthday.\n\nI did wait until midnight in case she was doing that thing that they do in movies where the person pretends they have forgotten someone's birthday when they actually haven't (I know that's stupid but still.) After it turned 12 it's really embarrassing but I just kinda broke down crying. I know it's stupidly crying over something that isn't a big deal but it just made me feel how I felt as a kid and it just brought back a lot of feelings and memories from my childhood. My wife walked in on me crying (pretty much in the middle of a panic attack to be honest lol) she asked me what was wrong and once I told her she got really angry and accused me of trying to make her feel bad for something that's not important.

If you're observing your wife's birthday and she blows yours off, that is very much unacceptable behavior from a partner.  Then she doubled down.

I'm so sorry that your wife was so unsympathetic.  \n\nIt is completely legitimate to want other people to recognize your birthday.  I wish I knew you in real life - I would bake you a lopsided cake or give you a card or a little present, and I would put it in my calendar to do in future years.    \n\n\nDo you have a counsellor?  It might be worth looking for one - even to talk through this as a one-off, and get some help in communicating to your wife why it is a big deal for you.  \n\nNext year, one option is to put it on the family calendar ahead of time and plan an event yourself.  Talk to your daughter about being excited to have people celebrating you.  She will be five, and old enough to learn how to express some empathy.   If she asks about how she can get you a present/card, you can do something like point her to a bin of craft supplies and wrapping paper, or take her to a dollar store with $5 and agree to meet her at the front ... Invite some friends as well as your wife, either for a family-friendly afternoon celebration or to meet you for a drink or movie in the evening.   Then none of it is depending on your wife.   Also, don't hesitate to mention to your co-workers about a week ahead of time that Thursday is your birthday.  Some of them might give you a card or a coffee-break treat, or might propose going out to lunch together.  Or you could order a cake or other treats for the office and invite everyone.  Even if your team is remote or not big on in-person socializing, you'll probably get lots of festive greetings, and there is nothing wrong with wanting them or with giving people the information.  \n\nAfter you've had one festive birthday, be sure to thank everyone who participated, including your 5yo.  If your wife participated in the celebrations, try talking to her about why it mattered to you.  Maybe you can say that while you'd rather have her do something for you without being reminded, getting birthday recognition is important enough to you that you'll keep reminding people.  \n\nAlso, see if she's willing to talk about her own feelings about birthdays.  Does she like the kinds of things you usually do for her, or would she rather have something different or nothing?

It's manipulative, and only \"fun\" for the people putting on the surprise, not the one receiving it. Why would anyone ever put someone they care about through a day like that?", "NTA\n\n>I told her she got really angry and accused me of trying to make her feel bad for something that's not important. She was shouting at me a lot \n\nThat was really insensitive. I'm sorry you had to go through that. \nSometimes people are busy and they forget stuff which is fine. But reacting that strongly when reminded is completely uncalled for.\n\nI'd assume after all those years together your wife would know how important remembering your birthday is.", "NTA But I hate to be the one to tell you, you're in an abusive relationship. You're crying having a panic attack and your wife's reaction to it is  to gaslight you and to tell you you're not important. And she's teaching your daughter to do the same....", "NTA - leave your wife. wtf is wrong with her.    \n\n\nIf she forgot she forgot, but shes gas lighting you. thats emotional abuse.", "NTA. I'm not sure I'd be able to carry on with someone that would yell at you for being in your feelings. It's not like you called her out. She shouted at you because she forgot YOUR birthday. It's obviously important to you. Damn man. I'm sorry.", "NTA.\n\n>She was shouting at me a lot and she was quite loud\n\nThis is such an incredibly inappropriate way to respond to realizing your partner is upset/that your actions hurt them, that it's basically impossible for me to believe you have a marriage that is healthy at all. Don't let her manipulate you into thinking you're the problem here for being hurt.", "NTA. that sucks dude. it really does. but man your wife rubbed salt in the wound so to speak. is she always so mean?? you where upset & she yelled at you?? that's so harsh man. id want an apology if i was you. happy belated birthday!!", "Wow your wife is a piece of work.\n\nShe forgets your birthday then shouts at you for being upset.\n\nNTA", "Nta and happy belated birthday *hug*", "Happy Belated Birthday OP \ud83c\udf89\nI'm so sorry your wife didn't acknowledge your bday, but may I suggest, as your daughter gets older, you could make it into a special day for the two of you maybe ? as in celebrating together your special day, I think its a nice idea ...\nand you wife needs to get her shit together, birthdays don't have to be enormous and flashy but it's still a good time to appreciate the birthday person and you deserve it !", "After that I would have went and cried some more and kick her out the bed room", "NTA", "NTA, your wife sounds pleasant", "NTA WHY IS SHE MAD THAT YOUR CRYING CAUSE SHEEE FORGOT YOURRR BIRTHDAY?!!

I don't really celebrate my birthday and have never put much importance on it, not even as a kid. But I would nevertheless be hurt af if my partner (and even some close friends) forgot it entirely. In your case, the day itself even means something to you - which I presume she knows. You are certainly not being stupid, much less embarrassing, for crying over it. \n\nAnd if I had been her, and even if it had been a genuine mistake because sometimes life happens, I would immediately have consoled you, been beyond apologetic and moved freaking mountains to make it up to you. I certainly wouldn't have been a biatch about it and attacked you further. That is not fair and it's extremely crappy behavior on her part. She dismissed you and your feelings and that is never ok.\n\nSo sorry and a happy belated birthday.", "I\u2019m really sorry for how it seems everyone has treated your birthday throughout your life\u2026. But I do have to ask, are you content with and ready for it to be this way every year the rest of your life? Because it looks like that\u2019s how it\u2019ll continue to be with your wife", "why did your wife marry you if she doesn't like you?\n\nNTA", "NTA - my husband grew up in a similar way and I go out of my way to make sure he ALWAYS has a fun surprise and a super happy birthday. I don\u2019t have the same childhood trauma but would also be upset if he forgot my birthday and then told me it wasn\u2019t important. I am so sorry you had a shit birthday. Happy Belated Birthday!", "Oh hun, my heart breaks for you it really does. You are NTA and it is not stupid to cry because someone that you love deeply, who is supposed to love you, not only forgot your birthday, but then acted like you were wrong for being upset. You deserve better than that.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like you are in an abusive relationship. Your wife's response was inappropriate. You did nothing wrong and having emotions isn't a bad thing.", "NTA but honestly if your birthday is important and you\u2019re a grown person you need to remind people that it\u2019s coming up", "NTA\n\n Neither my wife nor I really care about our birthdays, but we'd rip each other up one side and down the other if one of us forgot. It's a dick move to not acknowledge someone's birthday, and from your wife - who knows what you went through - to say \"it's not important\" is just cruel.\n\nEDIT: After OPs comment (https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fwgel/aita_for_crying_when_my_wife_forgot_my_birthday/kcx10j2/)[here], this is even more fucked up. Wife likes huge birthdays for her, but does something small for OP every year, and had the unmitigated gall to tell him that his birthday isn't important!?", "NTA. You don't forget your spouse or child's bday, period. Doing so firmly makes here an AH and doubling down and belittling you, likely lashing out from her own feeling s over the mistake further makes here an AH. \n\nDon't apologize or feel bad for your feeling they are valid and real and your wife owes you an apology and a conversation. This is very unloving and cold behavior from the person who love you.", "NTA\n\nI am sorry that your wife forgot your birthday and that she said that it was not important and  that your parent's where shitty when it came to your birthday. \n\nI also feel from the way you described your wife's reaction to you crying was also more because she didn't know how to deal with situation. \n\nIt sounds like you may need explain to your wife about how your birthday was not really acknowledged by your parents when you were growing up.  \n\nAlso crying is good for you as a emotional release mechanism.   \n\nHappy belated Birthday!", "Your wife reacted to her goof by deflecting and blaming you. She will only get worse. NTA. But re-evaluate your relationship. She\u2019s toxic", "So, reading your replies it looks like your birthday and feelings are never important to your wife. That's not good. If I were you, I'd get some therapy to address the childhood trauma and reassess if you're living a life where you feel supported and safe.

What an unkind and uncaring response from your wife!

No worthy SO would say that BS.", "sorry I didn't say that you might've misread it.

Andrew Tate 4ever! /s", "what?", "So you can  forget her birthday then because it isn't important right?", "OP, I am VERY concerned that you wife was dismissive of your birthday.\n\nIs she aware of how you grew up, with your birthday being ignored?\n\nIs your wife normally dismissive of your feelings?\n\nNTA", "My wife and I both have ADD and therefore we have \\*both\\* forgotten each other's birthdays and anniversaries before. The difference is that when we do remember we are super apologetic and acknowledge it. \n\nYou didn't intentionally cry in front of your wife to manipulate her or make her feel bad.

If I were you, I\u2019d be taking a really big and long look at my relationship.", "Does she plan those things or do you?  When it\u2019s her birthday does she plan herself a party and buy her own presents?  Or do you do it all without any prompting from her?", "Huh. And you're ok with that?", "Not trying to be rude, but it seems that you do mind. It's not really up to her if you want to celebrate *your* birthday. It's Yours! And you should celebrate it if *you* want!", "I get the impression that you do want something, that you would like a celebration or a surprise. You are doing yourself a disservice by not communicating explicitly what you want. It does take away part of the birthday magic but then you can actually get what you want.
