I don't really care too much about presents or doing anything special it just would've been nice for her to at least acknowledge that it was my birthday.\n\nI did wait until midnight in case she was doing that thing that they do in movies where the person pretends they have forgotten someone's birthday when they actually haven't (I know that's stupid but still.) After it turned 12 it's really embarrassing but I just kinda broke down crying. I know it's stupidly crying over something that isn't a big deal but it just made me feel how I felt as a kid and it just brought back a lot of feelings and memories from my childhood. My wife walked in on me crying (pretty much in the middle of a panic attack to be honest lol) she asked me what was wrong and once I told her she got really angry and accused me of trying to make her feel bad for something that's not important.

If you're observing your wife's birthday and she blows yours off, that is very much unacceptable behavior from a partner.  Then she doubled down.

I'm so sorry that your wife was so unsympathetic.  \n\nIt is completely legitimate to want other people to recognize your birthday.  I wish I knew you in real life - I would bake you a lopsided cake or give you a card or a little present, and I would put it in my calendar to do in future years.    \n\n\nDo you have a counsellor?  It might be worth looking for one - even to talk through this as a one-off, and get some help in communicating to your wife why it is a big deal for you.  \n\nNext year, one option is to put it on the family calendar ahead of time and plan an event yourself.  Talk to your daughter about being excited to have people celebrating you.  She will be five, and old enough to learn how to express some empathy.   If she asks about how she can get you a present/card, you can do something like point her to a bin of craft supplies and wrapping paper, or take her to a dollar store with $5 and agree to meet her at the front ... Invite some friends as well as your wife, either for a family-friendly afternoon celebration or to meet you for a drink or movie in the evening.   Then none of it is depending on your wife.   Also, don't hesitate to mention to your co-workers about a week ahead of time that Thursday is your birthday.  Some of them might give you a card or a coffee-break treat, or might propose going out to lunch together.  Or you could order a cake or other treats for the office and invite everyone.  Even if your team is remote or not big on in-person socializing, you'll probably get lots of festive greetings, and there is nothing wrong with wanting them or with giving people the information.  \n\nAfter you've had one festive birthday, be sure to thank everyone who participated, including your 5yo.  If your wife participated in the celebrations, try talking to her about why it mattered to you.  Maybe you can say that while you'd rather have her do something for you without being reminded, getting birthday recognition is important enough to you that you'll keep reminding people.  \n\nAlso, see if she's willing to talk about her own feelings about birthdays.  Does she like the kinds of things you usually do for her, or would she rather have something different or nothing?

What she said probably doesn't reflect how she actually feels. \n\nMy suggestion is to talk about your birthday all month. Tell your wife where you want to go that day. What do you want to do? Hint all year around about the gifts you want for your birthday. Get yourself excited for it, and the rest will typically fall into place. Don't just wait until the second after your birthday. Have a family calendar and pen it in with everyone's birthdays.

That is gaslighting my friend. Manipulating you in to thinking it's some how your fault that both of you are upset now and that there's nothing to cry about. Mate- your birthday means a lot to you, AND your feelings are valid. \n\nYou are gonna need to put the big pants on and get some self confidence going. I do not like the way it sounds like things are going in your house. You need to start standing up for your feelings, your beliefs and your right to be appreciated and loved.

Not everybody, I bloody wouldn't ever treat someone like that.

I just happen to be generally a nice person. But- there are some idiots out there who seem to judge others who they think are weak. Or weaker. When you stand up and tell them to FO, and I mean mentally, not verbally.

You're only talking about this one issue so hopefully she's not the latter. She's turned the conversation into a power game so that she can put the blame back on you and she doesn't have to feel guilty. A healthy person can handle a little bit of guilt, especially about forgetting someone's birthday. This doesn't mean she doesn't care about you- but it means somethings do need talking over. How you do birthdays for a start, or even how you don't do birthdays, needs to be agreed together over a nice cup of tea. Not an argument, it's not about blaming her again, it's about you pointing out that you are half the parent team here, an adult in the family, and what you want is equally important. Things need to be EQUAL. if she thinks birthdays are nonsense (weirdo) then you guys will have to compromise. An example would be that you arrange to go out on your birthday for example, and share it with friends next year.\n\nGet your friends sorted next year, stand tall and look after yourself.

On top of her neglect, it is really concerning that she accused you of being manipulative when you were having a panic attack. That is not okay and a huge red flag. Your partner should be responding to crying, panic, anxiety with love and support. She should have apologized. She deflected her feelings of guilt and got angry at you instead of taking on her role (i.e. \"youre trying to make me feel guilty! Stop that!\" Versus \"omg I feel so guilty. I clearly fucked up. This meant a lot to you and I feel bad about myself but it was my fault\")", ">I'm not at all questioning how you do or don't do things, but if I were the wife in question and knew my husband had trauma surrounding his birthday, I'd figure out a way not to forget\n\nOh, yeah, neither of us have trauma around this particular thing. Sometimes we remember a month in advance, get gifts, then give them right away because we rembember \\*then\\* and we're excited \\*then\\* and there's no need to wait for the actual birthday ... sometimes we'll be sitting on the couch and one of us will be like \"huh, our anniversary was last week, wasn't it,\" and we laugh and plan something after the fact.\n\nBut the point is, when either of us \\*is\\* upset about something, neither of us would react the way this OP's wife did because it's abusive to outright berate your spouse for having emotions. We find ways to support each other in the things that matter to each of us.", "No! You don\u2019t go to marriage counseling with an abuser. And this woman has abuser written all over her. Just get counseling for yourself and a divorce for the abuser.", "Are you sure? You cried because she did \"forget\" your birthday and after she asked you why are you crying she was getting mad at you and shouted at you. A normal reaction about a loving partner should be: \"Oh dear I am so sorry that I had forgotten your birthday!\"\n\nNot getting mad at the partner who is crying. Not shouting at the partner and waking up the little child.\n\nYour wife is cruel to you. Especially she LOVES her birthdays and they are important to HER. But your birthdays are not important for her.\n\nDoes that sound like she loves you? For me not. Sorry. And I think its time to think about how often does she reacting like that towards you.\n\nYou are NTA for sure. But I fear that you are living in an abusive relationship and dont realize it yet.", "Can I ask what you\u2019re basing that on?", "Then NTA", "I am sorry that your wife is regularly invalidating your feelings, OP. If you think it might open her eyes, show her this post. YES, it is a big deal that she chose to yell at her distressed partner instead of apologizing. NO, she can't expect to be feted on her own birthday, and regularly shunt yours aside. YES, you deserve better treatment from your life partner.", "Welcome to AITA", "Don\u2019t forget Narcissist.", "Fact", "Gaslighting isn't just blatantly lying to you, though, it's manipulation of the truth.
