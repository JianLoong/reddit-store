Due to summer this amenities are very busy and we need to book it weeks in advance.

We had the fridge full of food, deserts, beverages, so it was annoying to have someone we don't know just entering and going through our stuff.

There is even a sign at the entrance.\r  \n\r  \nBut the fridge is public.

At least not like that.\r  \n\r  \nSo I can\u2019t use the fridge?\r  \n\r  \nAs I just explained to you, when there is a reservation going on like right now, no, you can\u2019t.\r  \n\r  \nYou are REALLY telling me I can\u2019t use the fridge? (here I got tired of her attitude)\r  \n\r  \nYes, I am telling you that you CAN NOT use it. Is it clear now?\r  \n\r  \nThen she got her stuff and left.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a while another lady came over and asked to talk to me.\r  \n\r  \nHey what happened? Why did you kick my friend out?\r  \n\r  \nI just explained to her that there was a private event going on.\r  \n\r  \nAnd what is the problem? Everybody shares the fridge.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is I we need to book this place in advance, before you can start security comes in and makes an inspection and I also need to leave a CAD 500.00 cheque with property manager as a guarantee for any damage, so I think its fair for me to just want my guests to be using this area during the time I reserved it for. Also, we are having a familly gathering so having people we don't know wandering around the room, and going through our stuff is not something I want to happen.\r  \n\r  \nThen she apologized and left but her attitude showed she thought I was being a petty AH.
