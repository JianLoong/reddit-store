Due to summer this amenities are very busy and we need to book it weeks in advance.

Why did you kick my friend out?\r  \n\r  \nI just explained to her that there was a private event going on.\r  \n\r  \nAnd what is the problem? Everybody shares the fridge.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is I we need to book this place in advance, before you can start security comes in and makes an inspection and I also need to leave a CAD 500.00 cheque with property manager as a guarantee for any damage, so I think its fair for me to just want my guests to be using this area during the time I reserved it for. Also, we are having a familly gathering so having people we don't know wandering around the room, and going through our stuff is not something I want to happen.\r  \n\r  \nThen she apologized and left but her attitude showed she thought I was being a petty AH.
