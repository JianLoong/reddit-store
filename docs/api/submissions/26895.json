I offered to pick him up, and she gave me a few bucks in gas money. \nJ came up to me the first day after practice,  and asked if I could take his friend (Z) home too. They all live in the same housing development,so I said sure.

He was the absolute RUDEST child I have ever encountered. The rest of the boys are funny,  and polite. We cut up, joke around.  But this kid.....\nSome of the things he did on the way home:\n\nCalled A the F slur. Said I was too fat to be driving a car.  Kept making fun of J's weight.  Was telling me, a 40 year old,  how to drive. My daughter,  8, was riding with us that day and she started laughing. He looked at he,  and said Why the fuck are you laughing?\n\nThis kid is 12. \n\nI got to J's house,  and I let all of them out. They live close enough where they can all walk home.

He was pissed at X, and said he would handle it.\n\nA month passes, and X tried to get a ride again.

She asked why I was refusing to take her BABY home.  I went over everything her BABY said and did. Of course she didn't believe it. She said she thinks it's  fucked up that I can help all the other moms but not her. I told her,  if your kid had a little more sense, then he could still have a ride.

He learned phrases like 'Im going to go home and kill myself' from his mama. \n\nMy view generally in life is that everyone deserves a second chance, however in this case the behaviour is so extreme that there's no way I would grant that to this family. \n\nGreat that you help out the other mums - focus on the positive things in life!", "You may need to contact the coaches re X and mom if this behavior doesn\u2019t stop.", "NTA.

It is really unpleasant to be around children like that. I had taken a course to coach children for soccer as a co-worker stated her sons league was short on coaches.

You feel bad he's excluded, so you'll give him another chance if he wants it. You'll drive him home, but the rules of behavior in your car are no insults, no swearing, everyone is kind.  Basically act like a teacher would want you to act in front of them. The other boys would enjoy having him if he could maintain his behavior for the ride, so you hope he'll choose to.\n\nIn my ideal world he keeps his shit together, and behaves for all future rides.  He has minor slip ups, but one of the other boys covertly corrects him, and he listens, so you pretend you didn't hear the slip up because you see he's trying hard. \n\nThis isn't the ideal world, and I know it. Chances are good if you pulled him aside to tell him, he'd be too scared to respond well, and he'd just say fuck you and walk off, already regretting it in his head but not able to back down. \n\nIn the real world, if your kid and the other boys think he's worth it, you could have them make the offer though. \n\nJust me here, trying to save the world. \n\nYou are not out of line.
