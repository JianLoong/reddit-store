You never know what could happen if someone else came by and hurt themselves with it. But you probably should\u2019ve just turned it in to the school instead of taking the needle off.

Type 1 and 2 runs in my family and unfortunately these supplies are unaffordable and are reused and few times before we switch to new needles and lancets.

Maybe if she had kept it sanitary, yes, but if you lose a needle in a random place you probably shouldn't reuse it.", "We have free healthcare in uk so we don\u2019t need to buy supplies plus the fact that it was found on the ground so the needle was clearly dirty even after being used multiple times", "In the uk we have free healthcare so we don\u2019t need to buy supplies etc", "We have free healthcare in the uk so it\u2019s not a matter of cost, plus the fact is that it was already on the ground uncapped so it was most likely unsterile and I could tell it had already been used multiple times, as an apology I gave her a few needles of my own", "EXACTLY!", "It was a used needle at a school.

It\u2019s work to get free stuff but it\u2019s possible. Especially for diabetes supplies.

Also obviously they don\u2019t check to make sure she has the clean needles she needs which is a huge failure on them but the child was given brand new needles from OP.", "These insulin pens aren\u2019t just uncapped, they come with a cap. And what if someone else who found the pen and decided to throw it away didn\u2019t have compatible insulin pen needles (extremely likely)? The girl, whose insulin pen OP decided to throw the needle from, would then have no way of administering insulin while at school that day, which is a serious issue. \n\nBottom line is OP should have just minded her own business.", "Did you miss the part about it being a school? With kids ? Kids like to play with things they shouldn\u2019t. Teens included. Not everybody knows needle safety, a cap is not 100% guaranteed. And is STILL not a good enough excuse to just leave it. Try harder if you\u2019re going to change my mind.", "If you read the OPs comments it was UNCAPPED on the ground and they are in the UK so they don\u2019t have to pay for the needles.

Insulin pens have caps that cover the needle area. Are you saying this pen was uncapped? Or did you remove the cap, unscrew the needle, and then recap it? Also how did you dispose of the needle?", "NTA\n\nThere's a number of reasons why this was the right thing to do. She needs to grow up, she's the one who left a needle out. If the school heard she could've gotten in massive trouble.", "NTA. Don\u2019t know what her problem was.", "I am also diabetic and I use these insulin pens.  The pens come with caps so the needle part is not going to be exposed. Plus the needle part is not like a full syringe. It's a tiny cap that twists onto the top of the pen with a tiny needle attached. A little bigger than a pencil eraser. The pen part allows you to dial up the dosage you need to inject. You are supposed to replace the needle tip every time but I'll use mine 2 or 3 times as long as I keep it clean.\n\nI wouldn't have touched the needle part. Just left it on there and put the cap back on. Because that would be the part that could infect you if the person had some other disease.", "ESH.\n\nYou're TA for handling a needle when you didn't know who it belonged to. By \"handling\" I mean the part where you inspected it, saw it was used, and *twisted it off the pen*. Why did you do that? Even if you thought the needle was new/not-yet-used, you don't handle/remove a needle if you don't know who it belongs to. You could've easily pricked yourself with a dirty needle in this scenario -- a biohazard.\n\nYes, I know you handle needles like this every single day. But even medical professionals who use needles ten times more than you do can accidentally stick themselves. It was an unwise and unnecessary risk you took (even if you did it out of simple habit).\n\nShe's TA because she didn't say thank you for finding her pen, returning it to her, and giving her another needle.", "NTA she shouldn't be leaving that laying around", "NTA teenagers get mad.  Doesn't make them right.", "NTA", "NTA you\u2019re right she shouldn\u2019t be reusing needles and you gave her some of yours. I think she owes you a thank you.", "NTA I understand that needles are expensive (I have had patients try to reuse them) it is way too big of a risk to reuse needles. It sounds like she is redirecting her anger at the wrong person", "NTA.  At one school a student took an insulin needle that another student put in regular trash and went around stabbing other students. Yes, it was a nightmare everyone.", "NTA", "NTA.", "Nta but I imagine the other kid was in panic mode when she realized she lost her meds. She didn't act right but I've been through a panicked adrenaline rush and it's easy to act out. Especially when you're young. Again, you were doing the right thing, but don't hold it against her too hard.", "NTA, but that was really foolish. Handling somebody else's used needles like that puts you at risk for a needle stick injury. You need to protect your own health first.", "NTA the pen was just lying on the ground? a fence? basically untended? heck I'd have tossed it myself.", "NTA - It was an unattended needle and biohazard. I would recommend not touching it in the future and just making the school aware of it. I think your ability to give her new needles resolved any issue and that should be end of it. Can I just ask though; with kids needing these needles, do the schools carry any extra in the nurses office for kids who are medically cleared to use them? I am sure there are rules about the nurses administering medication, but what about medical supplies? If not, and if they are allowed to hold them, this might be something you make a request for just in case another student runs out of needles, or doesn't have access to them. I realize this is likely a no since they can't even give the kids an aspirin, but figured I'd at least pose the question.", "meh... if this is in the US then all of Molly's family probably had their education already.\n\nAnd that education was: \"you cant afford the medicine that keeps your child alive\".\n\nMolly was really giving me strong \"poor kid knows this will cost her parents a bunch of needle-money they dont have\" vibes.", "The needle was uncapped and was most likely already used", "The cap was not on the needle and the needle in general looked dirty I used I wet wipe over my hands to dispose of the needle", "The nurse would have just tossed it in the sharps container.  The nurse is not going to give someone back a dirty, used needle/syringe that was found in the dirt!  Especially if the nurse is unable to verify the contents of the syringe, and I don't mean on the word of a teenage girl.", "OP commented they live in the UK, where diabetics get free prescriptions.

I have accidentally poked myself with them before.  Ouch.  Haha.  Next time, not that your ever going to find one just laying around again, don't touch it. If the person has Hepititis or some other infection disease, even a small poke could infect you. It's unlikely, but healthcare workers have become infected like this. It's unlikely this girl had anything but you never know.", "In the original post, you said it was slightly twisted. Now you\u2019re saying dirty. Not sure I can believe any details from you now.", "Thanks for specifying. That changes things a lot -- not in terms of ultimate judgment (I'd consider you NTA regardless), but in terms of understanding why the girl might have been so upset. Here in the US, sadly, people are often put in the position of having to reuse needles or even ration out insulin, even though we all know it's risky to do so. In the UK, I'd just write it off as Molly feeling embarrassed and self-conscious over the entire situation and not dealing with that emotion in the best way. Those emotions can be hard sometimes when you're a teenager.", "That she lives in the UK was not in the original post. In the US, this could have led to a life-threatening situation! Yes, our health care system sucks that it is better for a child to reuse a needle she dropped on the ground because otherwise, she very well not be able to get her insulin injection.", "Molly sounds like she uses a pen, which is prefilled with a bunch of doses of insulin. The pens are meant for multiple doses, and the needles are replaceable.\n\nIf that helps for context.", "If anything, she'd be re-using the needles to save money. With an insulin pen you're supposed to use one needle per injection.", "Oh trust me I know.
