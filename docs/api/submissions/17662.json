I would recommend not touching it in the future and just making the school aware of it. I think your ability to give her new needles resolved any issue and that should be end of it. Can I just ask though; with kids needing these needles, do the schools carry any extra in the nurses office for kids who are medically cleared to use them? I am sure there are rules about the nurses administering medication, but what about medical supplies? If not, and if they are allowed to hold them, this might be something you make a request for just in case another student runs out of needles, or doesn't have access to them.

Not sure I can believe any details from you now.", "Thanks for specifying. That changes things a lot -- not in terms of ultimate judgment (I'd consider you NTA regardless), but in terms of understanding why the girl might have been so upset. Here in the US, sadly, people are often put in the position of having to reuse needles or even ration out insulin, even though we all know it's risky to do so. In the UK, I'd just write it off as Molly feeling embarrassed and self-conscious over the entire situation and not dealing with that emotion in the best way. Those emotions can be hard sometimes when you're a teenager.", "That she lives in the UK was not in the original post. In the US, this could have led to a life-threatening situation!

Please continue to behave so.", "NTA. She overreacted because she thought she\u2019d be needle-less for the day.

Once she\u2019s cooled off she\u2019ll probably realize she lost her cool and be embarrassed. Maybe you can be insulin buddies. Next time you see her, let her know you\u2019ve got her back if she ever forgets her extra supplies. Having a peer that understands her struggles could be all she needs.

One cap that covers the insulin reservoir and needle, and a little one that covers that actual needle itself. Sometimes people choose not to put the little one on, so it\u2019s best to keep the big one on to protect yourself in case the little one is not on. This would have prevented you from seeing or touching the needle at all. \n\nThird, if you chose to screw off the needle, you are putting yourself in way more danger than had you just left the cap on as stated above.

She\u2019s not following up with her health by getting new (free) needles and that\u2019s on her-not you. If she\u2019s going to leave her pen somewhere she isn\u2019t in control of (even if by accident), then she needs to accept that safety comes first.", "NTA. Why the hell would she even consider using it still? It posed a hazard not only to her but everyone else.", "Info: was the cap on the needle or was it exposed because of the cap was on the needle? then YTA. Don't screw with others meds. You don't know her situation. Your right shouldn't reuse those needles, but that's not your call to make. If the cap is off and the needle was exposed then NTA", "NTA\u2026   \nRaise it with the school. Molly might well be having issues accessing clean needles for her health care, and school can help. Or Molly might have been told 100x not to do what she did and raging at you and deserves a kick in the butt again. Or Molly might have had wrong sugars and been up/down and reacting out of that.", "Nta for picking up a needle at school.  but her parents might not be giving her the same healthcare as yours are. My mum was T1 and we live in Australia so affordable healthcare but it\u2019s still not actually free and diabetes is expensive as hell. Her condition has us (single parent only child) living on the poverty line until I moved out of home, when she was finally able to afford her medication and more a more middle class lifestyle(holidays, a new car, nicer groceries ect) All of the supplies for diabetes add up, special foods at the grocery store, the equipment, the medicine, are an extra cost but on top of that (and something you may not be thinking about yet) is the cost of time off work for appointments and petrol to get to them, parking at the hospital, and right now with the cost of living crisis, the energy crisis ect household budgets are tight. She may be newly diagnosed as well which is would make everything even more overwhelming. Her stress about this may come from the fact she knows she doesn\u2019t have enough/ won\u2019t be able to get more, or her parents will be angry with her about it. \n\nI\u2019d suggest becoming a friend, being someone she can vent to, someone who gets it and someone who she can turn to if she is running low. Don\u2019t focus to much on lecturing her or educating her yourself, just be a friend who gets it.", "the school nurse would have disposed of it. the same way that OP did. because leaving an uncapped needle on the ground and reusing a needle is extremely dangerous to both public health and the owners health, especially at a school.", "And I am Elon Musk. If it was uncapped Molly would see at that moment that the needle was gone. Also OP said \"it seemed used and unclean\". Pen needles are like short hairs. That post is full of BS", "Prescriptions are free in the UK for children and chronic illness.", "She might be embarrassed that she doesn't have more needles so it's lashing out at you for reminding her/knowing this.", "Die you grow up in an abusive home?", "Or just call 111 and they\u2019ll send a prescription to a local pharmacy for you.", "Having chronic conditions is tough. Reusing needles is a really bad idea, but for a lifetime condition,  people are likely to slip up or forget things from time to time. Diabetes can be hellish. It's one of those 'fun' diseases where suicide rates are higher if you have it. I have it, and I'm good now, but I've certainly had some low points and made mistakes in the past, which I would primarily attribute to having it. Forgotten needles, forgotten to inject, it sucks, I've been dozy, I've done it.", "That's the old number,  now it's 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3", "Hello? Emergency services? Then who am I speaking to? Hello?", "Okay, but the kid didn\u2019t commit murder, she had an immature overreaction. It\u2019s apples and oranges", "In the UK she does.", "YTA! As a fellow type 1 diabetic you are ABSOLUTELY the AH here. It wasn\u2019t your insulin pen. You had no idea if she had another needle for the pen, you contaminated the rubber seal on her insulin pen, you made a medical decision for her without her permission and you decided you knew her diabetes practices better than her. This is infuriating! I have used my needles several times without changing. Most diabetics do. I will NEVER agree with anyone saying that what you did is fine. Next time you find someone\u2019s insulin pen, keep your hands off beyond turning it in to a teacher. There was zero reason for you to open the pen lid to check for a needle or anything. The name of the insulin is on the side of the pen. You knew what it was. The rest was not minding your business.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI get her initial panic because she didn\u2019t have any left but after you kindly gave her some of yours that should have completely been the end of her anger.", "NTA. She was scared,  and fear creates anger. You did everything correctly. I'm not from the UK, but does your school have needles available for a similar situation? If they do,  could you reassure the girl that if she runs out,  she can get help from the nurse (assuming there are school nurses in the UK.)  If she relies on her parents to procure the needles, it may happen again through no fault of her own.  And if she knows where and how to get one,  it will reinforce she is in a safe place.  \n\nI know here in the states they are not free and people do reuse them. Mostly due to cost but sometimes because they ended up being away from home longer than expected. It's not good,  but our healthcare system is not a good system.", "Exactly worst case scenario (as my mind always goes) someone else, possibly a younger child, finds it unaware of what it is plays with it injects themselves they are at risk of infection and the effects of insulin.", "Not only that but OP could have gotten seriously ill. Imagine the other girl had an STD and she accidentally pricked herself.", "A pen needle has TWO caps on it to keep it clean and safe. My brain hurts from reading all of these comments made by people who aren\u2019t diabetic who just don\u2019t get it. Many people use the same needle for a day. It makes no sense to throw out 4 syringes or more per day. That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of metal and plastic waste.", "I do! Someone found her life juice pen, uncapped it, removed the needle she needed to inject it (which may have been already used by May also have been clean and just attached to the pen so she wouldn\u2019t lose it before her next shot) and exposed the pen to anything gross on their hands. If she didn\u2019t have an alcohol swab she couldn\u2019t sterilize the pen making it extremely unsafe to use again until alcohol was present.", "The needle was uncapped on the ground per OP\u2019s comments. She did the right thing.", "Really? It was uncapped and on the ground, how could it possibly be hygienic?", "My high school always let student go off campus", "The needles have a little plastic cap.", "I reuse my needles and my insulin and all needles and infusion sets and insulin, etc are covered by my insurance entirely. There\u2019s no good reason why you can\u2019t reuse an insulin needle if it\u2019s not dull.", "Well she probably shouldn\u2019t have left the needle laying around uncapped in the dirt then. This her fault, not OPs. Molly was incredibly irresponsible.", "I still would handed it in like that she said at the time she didn't gabe another needle on her so if it comes to using a needle twice or dying you are going to use a needle twice, lucky op had spares on her I understand it's unsanitary but in life or death you'd do it hopefully she'll remember the needles next time. If was handed in like that the school could of dealt with it and op wouldn't be blamed if the school had told her to ask her parents to drop more off", "Removing a needle from a pen is not a click. You have to grab the needle bottom and unscrew it. OP is definitely in the wrong here and risked contaminating her insulin. Her literal life juice. If there was no lid then the pen would have been empty. There is no way anyone had an insulin pen uncovered.", "This was the UK, not America, so I doubt that's the issue. She should be able to get all the insulin she needs under UK healthcare.", "I would be pissy too if someone decided to finger eff my insulin pen and took the needle off exposing the rubber seal and contaminating it with the dirt on their hands. Gross!", "Sometimes people are just going to be mad, and it's not your fault, and you just gotta leave them alone to be mad.", "yeah i did see that they had to unscrew it, but ones i know click to undo and you can remove. my apologies there.\n\nif it was covered, removing it means it either cant be undone in your bag/pocket while you take it where it needs to go. it also prevents them from using a dirty needle. op did put themselves at risk, but they did it with the risks taken into account. \n\nthe person had lost it, so they mightve recently used it and forgot to recap it because they put it down for a second, we dont know. its unlikely op would have contaminated it, and if the person was worried about it, then she should have kept a better eye on it in the first place. \n\nop couldve left it, or they could have returned it. it was a choice to remove the needle to prevent unjury in case it came undone or the other person used the now/already dirty needle. \n\ni personally dont understand this other persons anger. it just seems like a knee jerk reaction to having lost it and letting the stress out imo. its not that big of a deal and she can get new free needles.", "Well I guess you shouldn't leave your used needles lying around on the ground and that won't happen", "Clearly she\u2019s not competent though if she\u2019s dropping used needles all over the place.", "What does this have to do with anything?\n\nAny child in the UK can pick up their own prescription and after 12 years old they can make their own medical decisions. Molly is an ungrateful kid misplacing her anger. Easier to be mad at someone else.", "[removed]", "Yeah, I am wondering if she needs more time with a diabetes educator or something.", "do you understand the state of the government or even the healthcare system atm? do you understand the nhs is stretched? that some people cannot get their medications? that some people are waiting months even years for treatment? because i do. because im living it right now. so perhaps don't tell a uk resident who's actually living through this stuff, that their inaccurate. you sound really privileged honestly if you think uk healthcare is perfect and helps everyone immediately. not everyone is exempt. my sister pays for her prescriptions. i don't because of my disabilities. but regardless of not needing to pay , i still struggle to get what i need because of the state of healthcare and the nhs right now.", "i havnt seen anything about what she did with it. if she has her kit on her she would have a small container or spot to put the used ones.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
