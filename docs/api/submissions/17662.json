I would recommend not touching it in the future and just making the school aware of it. I think your ability to give her new needles resolved any issue and that should be end of it. Can I just ask though; with kids needing these needles, do the schools carry any extra in the nurses office for kids who are medically cleared to use them? I am sure there are rules about the nurses administering medication, but what about medical supplies? If not, and if they are allowed to hold them, this might be something you make a request for just in case another student runs out of needles, or doesn't have access to them. I realize this is likely a no since they can't even give the kids an aspirin, but figured I'd at least pose the question.", "meh... if this is in the US then all of Molly's family probably had their education already.\n\nAnd that education was: \"you cant afford the medicine that keeps your child alive\".\n\nMolly was really giving me strong \"poor kid knows this will cost her parents a bunch of needle-money they dont have\" vibes.", "The needle was uncapped and was most likely already used", "The cap was not on the needle and the needle in general looked dirty I used I wet wipe over my hands to dispose of the needle", "The nurse would have just tossed it in the sharps container.

Not sure I can believe any details from you now.", "Thanks for specifying. That changes things a lot -- not in terms of ultimate judgment (I'd consider you NTA regardless), but in terms of understanding why the girl might have been so upset. Here in the US, sadly, people are often put in the position of having to reuse needles or even ration out insulin, even though we all know it's risky to do so. In the UK, I'd just write it off as Molly feeling embarrassed and self-conscious over the entire situation and not dealing with that emotion in the best way. Those emotions can be hard sometimes when you're a teenager.", "That she lives in the UK was not in the original post. In the US, this could have led to a life-threatening situation! Yes, our health care system sucks that it is better for a child to reuse a needle she dropped on the ground because otherwise, she very well not be able to get her insulin injection.", "Molly sounds like she uses a pen, which is prefilled with a bunch of doses of insulin.

You acted perfectly in removing the needle.  Then, when another diabetic stated it was theirs and they didn't have another needle, you offered up one of yours.  \n\nYou acted perfectly.  Please continue to behave so.", "NTA. She overreacted because she thought she\u2019d be needle-less for the day. It\u2019s hard to immediately come down from an adrenaline rush like the one she was having if she was filled with rage. Once she\u2019s cooled off she\u2019ll probably realize she lost her cool and be embarrassed. Maybe you can be insulin buddies. Next time you see her, let her know you\u2019ve got her back if she ever forgets her extra supplies. Having a peer that understands her struggles could be all she needs. I\u2019m not saying you have to become best friends, but it might ease the remaining tension if you\u2019re still worried about it. \n\nGood looking out, OP", "NTA at all!

Both can be true.", "People if you aren't sure don't say anything. Insulin pens have a cap, like a marker. It isn't an open generic needle that was contaminated by the street. And no, you don't change the needle after every use. I am doing 2 per day, been to hospital and private doctors, so I do know. You NEVER mess with someone else's medical things.

You shouldn't even touch the pen under the cap with your hands.", "Why would you even touch it??", "It depends on who you ask about reusing needles.
