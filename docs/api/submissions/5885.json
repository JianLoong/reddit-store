We had an amazing day and I wore the usual white dress. However I didn\u2019t want a white bag that I\u2019d never use again, so my bag/purse was made from the same gorgeous blue silk as my bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. It also meant my chief bridesmaid could hold it for me during the ceremony and photos, looked really cute and held all the little bits and pieces I wanted with me on the day (a girl needs to keep her makeup looking fresh).\n\nHowever, despite it not being white I rarely have the opportunity to use it but couldn\u2019t bring myself to get rid of it. So when husband\u2019s youngest sister announced she was getting married I thought it would be the perfect time to use my lovely little blue bag as my outfit was pretty neutral (NOT white or cream - I know the rules) and a bit of colour would help lift it a little. The bride was wearing white and none of her colours were blue so I thought it would be ok. \n\nWe were sat at the same table as my other SIL when she noticed my bag and mentioned it was the one I had on my wedding day. I was kind of surprised that she remembered it as I\u2019d forgotten that I was holding it in a small number of our wedding photos (not the main set, just some snaps my MIL took) but did confirm she was right and said I rarely got to use it these days and it was too cute not to take the opportunity. She was not impressed and said it was tacky to make her sister\u2019s day about me and my wedding. I tried to tell her that I honestly wasn\u2019t doing that but she wouldn\u2019t listen. To be honest I\u2019ve long suspected she has never liked me much but she\u2019s never been that openly hostile towards me. Anyways, it seems to have given her good reason to really dislike me and things have been very frosty ever since. \n\nSo Redditors, Am I the Asshole for using my wedding handbag at someone else\u2019s wedding? Of course I don\u2019t think I am, but my older sister-in-law clearly thinks I deliberately disrespected her sister, and just because I think I\u2019m innocent doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not an a-hole.", "created_utc": 1672254100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxht31/aita_for_taking_my_wedding_bag_purse_to_another/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her problems with me are her problems to bear, not mine.

If they get upset with you about something that your gut tells you is irrational, hold on to that feeling and stand firm. Difficult people like it when those they're being difficult to start to squirm and doubt themselves - it validates their feelings that they're not the ones in the wrong.", "There was absolutely nothing wrong with you taking that bag!

No one but your weird sil remembers that you even had a purse at your wedding.", "NTA you brought a blue purse to a wedding.  I'm assuming no one pointed and screamed \"OMG that's the purse OP had at HER wedding, everyone look at her and not the bride!\" so I think it's all OK.  SIL is just looking for stupid reasons to complain about you.", "I do limit contact, for other reasons. But obviously this time of year that can be tricky. I think I\u2019m just going to have to accept that she doesn\u2019t like me and will always find fault. Sucks, but there you are.", "I know, it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had to put up with this kind of teenage drama and I honestly don\u2019t miss it!", "It\u2019s looking like the more likely explanation. SMH!", "Probably. I haven\u2019t experienced this sort of petty drama since secondary school (high school)!", "I know,  no one else recognised it and I wouldn\u2019t have expected them to.", "It\u2019s basically a regular evening bag. I honestly didn\u2019t expect anyone to remember it from my wedding and that\u2019s not even why I used it. It\u2019s a nice bag and I don\u2019t own anything else as smart. Put me off using it again though.", "I\u2019ve never met a family so intent on creating drama either. I had never heard about the \u2018don\u2019t wear white to a wedding\u2019 thing until they gave one of the aunts a hard time for wearing a pink and white dress to my wedding. It was a summer wedding, she was wearing a summer frock that I actually thought was very pretty, but apparently some of them commented and she apologised to me for something I wasn\u2019t even fussed about.\n\nI guess the \u2018crazy\u2019 warning signs were there all along.", "I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s fixated on me, but she sure doesn\u2019t like me either. I wish I knew why but I\u2019ve a feeling there simply is no reason other than she\u2019s unhappy with her lot in life.", "That\u2019s my question!  I think my dress/veil is the only thing I haven\u2019t reworn.  My shoes were my bridesmaid\u2019s shoes from my cousin\u2019s wedding.", "That was just an example of what I meant, I'm talking about if it's flashy and obviously trying to draw attention to the person holding it. I can see why that would be annoying, but it isn't like that. I's just a normal purse.", "This is the weirdest post I\u2019ve seen in a long time, I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would care if you\u2019re carrying the purse you had at your wedding. NTA", "INFO: Does the bag say \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding day!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m the bride!\u201d on it, because otherwise it\u2019s just a purse.\n\nINFO 2: Did the actual bride have an issue with it?\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut there was a commentor in another post a few weeks ago that was adamant that anything worn on your wedding date was tacky to ever use at another wedding even if it didn't clock as wedding accessory. It wasn't a very popular commenter but there is at least 1 other person in that school of thought.", "NTA. I love wearing my wedding jewelry (just necklace, bracelet, and earrings - no tiara, of course!) to other people\u2019s weddings. It never even occurred to me that it would be an issue for anybody.", "NTA. Who cares. Even if it were white.... it's a purse. Who is paying attention to a guest's purse at a wedding????", "There's no such thing as a \"bridal bag\". You sound as unhinged as the SIL", "I was in my wedding. Am I an asshole for going to other people\u2019s weddings?", "Shhhhhh, Don't tell I am wearing the same underwear to two different weddings. I wouldn't want to upset the bride", "If it were me I would use it every single time I saw her.  Every single damn time.", "OMg. If only we could skip other peoples weddings just because we are married!", "WTF? NTA", "NTA it\u2019s just a bag she needs to get over self. What if you were a certain hair clip at your wedding? Are you not allowed to wear it at hers because he wore it on that day?", "NTA. Your SIL.... ffs, that isn't even logical! \ud83d\ude44", "I said she was fixated because I would not remember a bag someone was carrying at a prior event", "Good point. Me neither. I just don\u2019t understand why she had to go looking for a reason to make me look bad - it\u2019s just such a \u2018mean girls\u2019 thing to do yet we\u2019re supposed to be adults! Other stuff has happened since that just highlighted to me what an unpleasant person my SIL actually is. I was just trying to figure out if there was a particular reason and I think I\u2019m coming to the the conclusion that I may never know and I may have to accept that."]}
