{"id": 3080, "submission_id": "z304sk", "title": "AITA for wanting to workout at a different gym than my girlfriend?", "selftext": "About three weeks ago, my girlfriend (28F) started going back to the gym with her friends. I (29M) have been working out off and on in my small garage gym. She's joined me a few times but didn't really express much interest. When she did workout with me, she liked to talk a lot to where I felt it was a bit distracting.\n\nI decided that it would be a good idea to also go back to a regular gym (I've been feeling a bit guilty about not using it as much). I found an old-school style gym that appealed to me. When I got there Monday morning, I felt a sigh of relief and happiness to be back at a gym again. I had a great workout & just felt so much better.\n\nAfter my girlfriend got home from work, I told her about the new gym. She was super excited and then said, \"Ooh, nice! That means we can work out together now!\"\n\nMe - \"I thought you were enjoying going to your gym with your friends?\"\n\nHer - \"I am, but now we can work out together!\"\n\nI was a bit surprised at that comment because she never really expressed a lot of interest in that previously. She also didn't invite me to go workout with her at her gym. For me personally, I don't mind as I think it's healthy for partners to have their own hobbies, interests, etc. I also think that while it's great to spend lots of time together, having the ability to do stuff on your own is just as good. I said that I felt it was good for us to be able to do stuff on our own. I mentioned how she likes being social at her gym and talking to her friends, while I like just going in, lifting, and leaving. From what I can tell, the gym goers at my gym just aren't super social and are there mainly to get in, lift, and get out. Her gym seems to be more open to the social aspect but doesn't have a wide selection of free weights. I felt it was the best of both worlds as we each had a gym that met our needs.\n\nShe got upset & asked why I was being so unreasonable. I tried to tell her about the pros for us each having our own gym. She said, \"Fine,\" & went up to change. After we had dinner, we were relaxing in the living room watching TV when she said, \"So about earlier, I still think you're being unreasonable. Us going to the same gym isn't the end of the world, so I signed up for a new membership.\"\n\nI told her how irritated I was that she clearly wasn't listening & just disregarded my opinions. I said we don't need to spend every waking moment together and that doing so can be super unhealthy. She got angry and asked, \"Oh, so now you're tired of being with me?\" I asked if she was serious, said \"no, of course not\", and then went to my office to destress. We went to bed and haven't spoken about it since.\n\nYesterday, after she went to the gym, I got an angry text from one of her friends saying how I was a selfish asshole for not letting her workout with me. Rather than respond, I chose to ignore it.\n\nSo, am I an asshole for wanting to work out at a different gym than my girlfriend?", "created_utc": 1669236555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z304sk/aita_for_wanting_to_workout_at_a_different_gym/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She shouldn't have signed up for the membership after you explicitly told her how you felt. It seems manipulative for her to basically say that you don't like her anymore due to a small difference of opinion. A little clingy and controlling if you ask me.", "NTA, you sometimes need a break from each other, and if she is chatty and distracting while you are say, doing a bench press, then it is completely understandable. But it seems she really likes you and wants to spend time together. As a compromise, you could try organising a workout together every other week.", "Definitely NTA. Side note, she also sounds quite manipulative and controlling. It sounds to me that she has her own insecurities. \n\nThis is a bit of an assumption on my part, but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t totally trust you. I say this because I was once that girl. When my partner joined a new gym I was worried he would meet other girls there. I wanted to go with him a few times so any girls there would see me with him, so they would back off. (I had reasons not to trust him, he\u2019d cheated). \n\nFast forward, me and my partner occasionally train together, but usually separately. If we\u2019re doing it together it\u2019s because he\u2019s motivating me to train. But if he said he wanted to train alone I wouldn\u2019t take offence at all\u2026 I love training alone. It\u2019s my me time. I can just switch off. I kind of recharges me to go back to reality. I also just find I have a much better workout on my own. I hate when people in the gym talk to me. I put my headphones in even if I\u2019m not listening to any music so I can ignore anyone who speaks to me. \n\nSo yeah, you\u2019re NTA. She is. She\u2019s being controlling, manipulative, trying to make out that you\u2019re doing something wrong for wanting some time to yourself/ a hobby of your own, and in my opinion I don\u2019t think she trusts you.", "NTA, my wife fucking rules but I still don't like working out with her.  The idea that you *need* to do everything together is pretty immature.", "NTA, good luck my dude", "NTA. My wife and I used to go to gym together, but we wouldn't workout together while there, we'd both do our thing, so we could finish in a timely manner.", "Not... exactly. But I think there is way more to this than just not being able to go to the gym with you. Do you spend any meaningful time with each other outside of exercising? Like, REALLY meaningful time? When was the last time you went on a date? Did something romantic for one another? What's her love language? What's yours?   \n\n\nThis might genuinely be incompatibility, but hopefully it's not that serious. Dig a little deeper. \n\nNo one is the asshole.", "NTA - I agree with you 100%. Plus, working out together would take more time. I\u2019m a female and I like to work out with out my partner, and also do my own thing sometimes. It\u2019s healthy for the relationship. No disrespect to you girlfriend but I would never allow my friends to get involved. Be honest and let her know her friend crossed the line by texting. Good Luck.", "NTA\nI'm a solo gym goer as well. I don't like to socialize and it irritates me when other gym members hog machines and text or sit there and chat with friends while other people are waiting to use the equipment. Yeah, to each their own. But personally, I go to the gym to workout, NOT socialize. You seem the same and found a gym that suits you.   Its also super manipulative that she got her friend to text you and scold you about boundaries with it your relationship.  Stay solid on your person gym time buddy and good luck", "NAH, she was wrong to sign up for the membership and force you to share this, but I do think you could have pressed a little more on why this is important to her. Is she insecure about you meeting people? Does she feel like you aren\u2019t doing enough stuff together? Try seeing if there\u2019s something else you guys can do as an activity together, or maybe work out together 1-2x pwk. Otherwise, you might just be incompatible if you\u2019re each seeing the situation so differently.", "NTA-she sounds immature.", "NAH, but it sounds like maybe you said some stuff you shouldn't have. First she was sad about you seemingly avoiding her by signing up at a different gym. The she said fine, and gave up, but then for some reason you started talking about how great it is to do things apart making it worse and making it seem like you want to spend less time together. Maybe do the gym thing separate but work on some romance and doing things together and fix this mess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe you can find some other kind of activity to do together as well, such as cycling or hiking.", "NTA and for the life of me I will never understand friends texting partners about shit like this. That would be a relationship ender for me. \n\nYou really should have a deeper discussion with your girlfriend about why this bothers her so much. Does she not want you to meet people? Look at other women? Do you not spend any time together otherwise?", "NTA she sounds exhausting honestly. There's nothing wrong with wanting to work out alone and not making it \"quality time\"", "NTA \n\nSome couples workout together, or at the same place. Some don't.\n\nMany variables come into play in these situations. Interests, intent,  commitment, comfort and abilities are just a few of them.\n\nI'm not a gym fan. I prefer to workout at home. As a woman, I find that I don't have much in common with most other women at the popular type gyms. I'm not there to socialize. I don't care what I look like. I don't need \"pretty\" gear.  I'm not in competition with anyone except myself.  The experience is too reminiscent of high school for my personal taste.  There are people who love the atmosphere,  and I'm generally happy for them.\n\nI haven't tried a small gym because I've found that I'm content working out at home. It is designated me time.\n\nIt's okay to have me time, OP. Your me time can be working out, in a place of your choice, without your SO.", "NTA. She overstepped by clearly not listening to your wishes, signing up for that membership to your gym behind your back, and shit talking about you to her friends making you look like an asshole. She sounds immature. Hope you two can have an honest adult convo about this and get it resolved.", "NTA you want a dedicated routine and she wants a social hour.", "NTA, but if she wants to workout EXACTLY the same as you (time, parts, etc) you should let her try \n\nTen sets of high rep squats would likely break her (watch Pumping Iron together and tell her that\u2019s the expected regimen)\n\n*wont be believable if you look like Private Pyle", "NTA. I am as the same as you. While I am a pretty social person, I am not interested in visiting while at the gym.  I want to go in, work out, and then leave.  I even try to schedule my workouts during less-busy times of the day.", "Level-5 clinger alert. NTA.", "You should've been honest and told her that it is a moment for you. So no BS about how the other gym is better for her or that it is more her style. You lifting weights is a moment for you, and you would love to do other things with her, but the gym is you time. Now it just seems like you are looking for excuses to not go to the gym with her.\n\nNTA for wanting a moment for yourself. Though I think you are a bit the AH for not being straight with her.", "I agree, my husband and I had a trainer together and would lift together as well. However, we also enjoyed out own space at the gym sometimes. We just communicated when we needed this and neither of us took it personally. \n\nIt's nice to do things together if you mesh in that aspect. Here they clearly don't, I hate talking when I'm working out lol. \n\nHaving separate hobbies is healthy.", "He communicated his needs clearly, and she explicitly went against them. If she's having these issues she can be an adult and communicate them. VS trying to manipulate him into a situation he's clearly not ok with.NTA", "Doesn't seem very 'clear' to me .-. She seems pissy about a lack of quality time.", "Nope. Been married 23 years, my hubs and I have different tastes in gyms/ workout classes and have always used different gyms.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t ask for a workout buddy", "NTA. The gym is my \u201cme time\u201d. It\u2019s my time for self care. My spouse totally gets it and is super encouraging. Your gf sounds extremely clingy.", "NTA but just text her that she's welcome to tag along but you will be focusing on the workout, maybe even bring headphones", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds super-clingy and creepy. How about this -- she's signed up for a membership at your preferred gym? Fine! All you have to do is go work out at a different time than she does. And be obvious about it until she gets the hint. The friend texting you as well? This girl is not good news.", "She doesn't need his permission to sign up for a gym membership.", "Yup second this", "I mean I don\u2019t mind the texting if it\u2019s in between sets \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if you need a minute rest between sets, what\u2019s wrong with using that time to text?", "No, but it's the whole picture not just that little thing. If you disregard the feelings of those you care about and then guilt trip them for being upset, you're kinda an AH", "Then she can use her big girl words and say that to him.", "NTA, take the red flag. After you straight up told her you didn't want to work out with her, she went and got a membership behind your back and expected you to immediately bend. You are now getting bullied by her friends.\n\nThis is only going to escalate, do you want to be with someone who is codependent and doesn't care about your boundaries and is willing to get hostile with you if you try to establish any?", "NTA. You should have the right to work out by yourself if you want", "NTA. I understand that she wants to spend time with you, so you probably need to make sure y'alls are having quality time together. However, my husband is like her, and I am like you, we cannot workout together. We go to the same gym but generally at different times of day. She shouldn't have gotten a membership there after you told her valid reasons for it not being a good idea, but I do hope you weren't harsh with her for trying to be with you.", "NTA nah even couples need time apart.", "NTA\n\nGoing to the gym on your own is something you enjoy, you're there to workout and she seems to want to chat. \nWhy not suggest you take some time to find an activity you can do together, she obviously wants to spend time with you doing something.\nRock climbing, hiking, kayaking... anything really, could be a nice way to bond, grow your relationship and just spend some quality time together, that's NOT the gym.", "NTA. OP, my husband would spend every minute with me if he could. But if I said I wanted to do something alone, he'd be fine with that. The fact that your GF is this controlling and clingy, seems to have a degree in manipulation, AND tattles to her friends is NOT a good sign.", "I agree that it does seem like a gap in communication. Some people aren\u2019t great at knowing how to convey their needs and feelings in a relationship. They might take what their partner is saying as a personal criticism and get defensive. She might not even consciously realize that she is going about asking for needs to be fulfilled in a roundabout way. I think if OP broaches the subject of spending more quality time together, or doing physical activities outside together as opposed to working out in the gym together and his gf is still not receptive, that might make her the AH.", "This right here, like the fact that she has a posse who she is willing to bring into the relationship is a problem. You are supposed to just be dating her, not her and her back up. She is being controlling and manipulative", "I'm not talking about the minute between sets. I'm talking about the people who just *SIT* there and text for a long time.", "Are you the girlfriend?", "NTA, I'm not really a gym dude (though I do work out at home a bit) but the part about having your own time without your partner is absolutely true. Everyone needs a bit of time to be alone and just enjoy their own time a bit.", "NTA, tell her she is welcome to come to the gym with you, but you will be doing exactly what you normally do, working out and leaving without talking to other people.", "NTA but quit saying 'we don't have to spend every second together' type comments. Be more blunt, \"i don't want to work out with anyone. I don't like talking when i exercise\". When you do work out, don't talk with her. Don't be rude, just don't engage", "If she still doesn\u2019t lay off after OP tried a different communication method I would 10000% label her as the asshole lol she\u2019s a little immature", "I really hope not lol", "True truuuuue"]}
