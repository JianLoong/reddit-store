They are heavier and kind of floppy not crisp..\n\nSo I'm making breakfast yesterday and the kids are at the table. I have the chicken going and I'm making waffles. It's a good morning.  \n\nMy wife decided to \"help\" and covered the waffles in foil so they stayed warm. \n\nThey did.

I say this as someone whose partner once said, \u201cthe easiest way to turn a good steak into a piece of leather is to ask you to cook it.\u201d Some people need a LOT of time and practice to learn how to cook even simple things\u2026and still, they have a hard time. They CAN do it; it\u2019s not a case of weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s just *hard.*\n\nYour wife should be more accepting of the fact that you have your own way of cooking\u2014and to you, \u201cher way\u201d is not *different,* it is *wrong.* If she\u2019s the type of person who can accept criticism, then she should be able to accept this. If not, you got other problems.", "NTA. My husband and I both cook pretty well and often share duties in the kitchen. Thing is, we communicate. If I\u2019m in charge of the meal, he ASKS me what I need him to do. Same when he\u2019s in charge\u2026I ask what he needs. You say you\u2019ve had this argument repeatedly, but is it just you telling her that her \u201chelp\u201d is ruining the meal? Or have you tried sitting down with her when it\u2019s not mealtime and saying\u2026\n\n1. Honey, I appreciate that you want to help, but I\u2019ve got it. Please just go relax while I make dinner.\n\nOr 2. If you want to help, please ask me what I need you to do. Please stop just doing things because it stresses me out and it\u2019s not helpful.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done that and she still ignores you, then yes\u2026just walk away and let her finish.", "NTA. How many times should you have to explain that food is meant to be a certain way.  I'm not a food shop but I think she would drive me crazy.", "NTA\n\nShe summed it up perfectly. You care about how food tastes and feels. She does not. \n\nShe wants to help have her do prep work. Just keep her away from the heat.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd let's be clear: she's absolutely NOT trying to help. She's just interfering. If she actually, legitimately wanted to be of help, then she would come into the kitchen when you're cooking and say, \"How can I help?\" And listen to your responses, and follow through.\n\nBut she doesn't want to be helpful, she wants to control some aspect of what you're doing. So she interferes with your process. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Even if it literally means making the food significantly less tasty. And then she defends herself with the ridiculous argument that you . . . shouldn't care how food tastes. Which is about as illogical as it gets.\n\nYou are NTA, and you have addressed this about as kindly and thoughtfully as possible, because a lot of us would have gotten downright rude by now at what is at best her constant disruption and could arguably be deemed conscious sabotage on her part of your kitchen efforts. Gently, I would suggest that your wife needs therapy, to figure out why she CAN'T just ask you how she can be helpful, but rather needs to ACTIVELY INTERFERE anytime you try to cook. Is she jealous that you are a better cook? Does she just have control issues in general? Because SOMETHING is going on here. And in all of it, you are NTA.", "She doesn't respect your enjoyment for cooking or the boundaries you've set. very reasonable boundaries/", "NTA.   I would calmly undo whatever she is doing and ask her to leave the kitchen.

If not, she needs to stop being in the way.\n\n\n She wants to help? She can set the table, get the drinks, make sure there are hot pads on the table.", "INFO - with the previous examples, what did you say to her about helping you?", "NTA. Next time she wants to help, tell her to ask first what you need help with so she doesn\u2019t ruin the food. Have to tried to teach her how to cook for, explaining what she does usually ruins the meal? Sometimes you gotta be brutally honest for people to get the point.", "So she knows that she cannot cook at all then purposely ruins your good food then tells you your overreacting? This sounds unbearable and I have no idea how you haven\u2019t snapped yet. I got pissed off just reading it fucking hell. NTA, she\u2019s a big one", "Encourage her to take cooking lessons.", "NTA\n\nAfter 50 times (or even the 20th time), it's you caring about the fact that she disrespects the boundaries you've set. That's your problem - not that you care too much about food feels and tastes. Pretty sure this is marital counseling territory. There's something to why she keeps doing this to you. It sounds intentional now.", "Lol definitely NTA.

Because you\u2019ve told her to stop and that it doesn\u2019t help. A true loving partner would say sorry and stop. \n\nMy guess is she is jealous of the attention you get from the kids or people you are cooking for. Her weak excuse of nobody cares how it tastes is a load of bs. She\u2019s being borderline abusive and needs therapy to find out why she\u2019s so determined to undermine and disrespect you.", "Nobody wants the waffle turn all soft, wd want some crispness, plus if she covers it with foil while hot, uhhh no.\nIm someone eho enjoys any kind of meat WELL DONE, but i dont want it turn to black wood.

You could easily turn it into a learning curve by telling her not to cover the waffles etc, walking away when it\u2019s your turn to cook and leaving it to her is super unfair and doesn\u2019t help the situation at all. She wants to help so just tell her what actually will help, don\u2019t let her do the wrong thing then complain about it", "[deleted]", "ESH  She should ask you what she can do to help rather than assume the two of you have some culinary synchronicity. You should offer direction and maybe even try to teach her since she\u2019s a horrible cook. It also sounds like she had a reason behind her actions. She was trying to keep the waffles warm. Maybe she\u2019s tired of eating cold waffles and is afraid the cook will yell at her if she makes a criticism.

She may not be good at cooking, but there\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t have a job, whether that\u2019s prep work, plating, etc. \n \nIt sounds like you\u2019re ignoring her reasons for wanting to be involved, and \u201cI want my food to taste good\u201d is a bad way to respond to that.", "ESH.

I can imagine the children saying, \"Aww man, Mom's \"helping\" again.\" LoL", "NTA your wife sounds exhausting to live with. If she cares so little about how food tastes/feels she can just heat herself a microwave meal for every meal every day.", "NTA. Maybe you should just tell her straight up, stop messing with food I'm cooking. She's not helping, she's ruining it. If she wants to help then she can go step by step with you as you make it but not go willy nilly throwing steaks back on the grill like she knows what shes doing because she doesnt and no one wants a burnt steak", "Id be annoyed af if my husband did this shit. I hate people commenting on how I'm doing in the kitchen even while I'm busy when i cook all our meals. My husband's little brother does this all the time when he himself doesn't cook! And my husband wld tell him to stfu because again he doesn't bloody cook! \n\nMy hubby helps and that's wonderful bt he only does chopping up veggies or peeling of them.

Doubt it.", "if the wife doesn\u2019t want \u201ccold or rare food\u201d she can make it herself or say that.

It almost sounds like jealousy because she's probably well aware of her inability to cook more than microwave food, and is taking that out on her husband by making his food subpar so that she can feel better about her lack of skill, since he also said she surpasses him in basically every other aspect it sounds like she's trying to subtly ruin his cooking so she again feels better about being bad in that one aspect of their life, he's not allowed to be better at anything clearly.", "She says that he's an asshole for caring how the food feels and tastes. There is NO WAY she does not know that she's messing this up.", "Seems like he's communicated that multiple times, and is now at the point of just walking away.", "This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with gender.

Regardless if she doesn\u2019t care about the quality of the food, OP cares, and she is showing a complete disregard of OP\u2019s care and time and effort that went into making the meals to their satisfaction.

I love foods with strong flavours and when I cook theres a shit tonne of garlic/herbs whatever in there so I can taste it but I've never steamed a waffle and I take my steak bloodier than my husband does.
