They are heavier and kind of floppy not crisp..\n\nSo I'm making breakfast yesterday and the kids are at the table. I have the chicken going and I'm making waffles. It's a good morning.  \n\nMy wife decided to \"help\" and covered the waffles in foil so they stayed warm. \n\nThey did.

I explained for the fiftieth time that I enjoy making good food.

I say this as someone whose partner once said, \u201cthe easiest way to turn a good steak into a piece of leather is to ask you to cook it.\u201d Some people need a LOT of time and practice to learn how to cook even simple things\u2026and still, they have a hard time. They CAN do it; it\u2019s not a case of weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s just *hard.*\n\nYour wife should be more accepting of the fact that you have your own way of cooking\u2014and to you, \u201cher way\u201d is not *different,* it is *wrong.* If she\u2019s the type of person who can accept criticism, then she should be able to accept this. If not, you got other problems.", "NTA. My husband and I both cook pretty well and often share duties in the kitchen. Thing is, we communicate. If I\u2019m in charge of the meal, he ASKS me what I need him to do. Same when he\u2019s in charge\u2026I ask what he needs. You say you\u2019ve had this argument repeatedly, but is it just you telling her that her \u201chelp\u201d is ruining the meal? Or have you tried sitting down with her when it\u2019s not mealtime and saying\u2026\n\n1. Honey, I appreciate that you want to help, but I\u2019ve got it. Please just go relax while I make dinner.\n\nOr 2. If you want to help, please ask me what I need you to do. Please stop just doing things because it stresses me out and it\u2019s not helpful.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done that and she still ignores you, then yes\u2026just walk away and let her finish.", "NTA. How many times should you have to explain that food is meant to be a certain way.  I'm not a food shop but I think she would drive me crazy.", "NTA\n\nShe summed it up perfectly. You care about how food tastes and feels. She does not. \n\nShe wants to help have her do prep work. Just keep her away from the heat.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd let's be clear: she's absolutely NOT trying to help. She's just interfering. If she actually, legitimately wanted to be of help, then she would come into the kitchen when you're cooking and say, \"How can I help?\" And listen to your responses, and follow through.\n\nBut she doesn't want to be helpful, she wants to control some aspect of what you're doing. So she interferes with your process. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Even if it literally means making the food significantly less tasty. And then she defends herself with the ridiculous argument that you . . . shouldn't care how food tastes. Which is about as illogical as it gets.\n\nYou are NTA, and you have addressed this about as kindly and thoughtfully as possible, because a lot of us would have gotten downright rude by now at what is at best her constant disruption and could arguably be deemed conscious sabotage on her part of your kitchen efforts. Gently, I would suggest that your wife needs therapy, to figure out why she CAN'T just ask you how she can be helpful, but rather needs to ACTIVELY INTERFERE anytime you try to cook. Is she jealous that you are a better cook? Does she just have control issues in general? Because SOMETHING is going on here. And in all of it, you are NTA.", "She doesn't respect your enjoyment for cooking or the boundaries you've set. very reasonable boundaries/", "NTA.   I would calmly undo whatever she is doing and ask her to leave the kitchen.

If not, she needs to stop being in the way.\n\n\n She wants to help? She can set the table, get the drinks, make sure there are hot pads on the table.", "INFO - with the previous examples, what did you say to her about helping you?", "NTA. Next time she wants to help, tell her to ask first what you need help with so she doesn\u2019t ruin the food. Have to tried to teach her how to cook for, explaining what she does usually ruins the meal? Sometimes you gotta be brutally honest for people to get the point.", "So she knows that she cannot cook at all then purposely ruins your good food then tells you your overreacting? This sounds unbearable and I have no idea how you haven\u2019t snapped yet. I got pissed off just reading it fucking hell. NTA, she\u2019s a big one", "Encourage her to take cooking lessons.", "NTA\n\nAfter 50 times (or even the 20th time), it's you caring about the fact that she disrespects the boundaries you've set. That's your problem - not that you care too much about food feels and tastes. Pretty sure this is marital counseling territory. There's something to why she keeps doing this to you. It sounds intentional now.", "Lol definitely NTA. And thank you for not portraying your wife as an imbecile just because she fails so much at this one task. \n\nI know people like her and they are flat out not allowed near my stove anymore lmfao.", "NTA and the questions that you need to ask her is why is she intentionally sabotaging your hard work cooking? Because you\u2019ve told her to stop and that it doesn\u2019t help. A true loving partner would say sorry and stop. \n\nMy guess is she is jealous of the attention you get from the kids or people you are cooking for. Her weak excuse of nobody cares how it tastes is a load of bs. She\u2019s being borderline abusive and needs therapy to find out why she\u2019s so determined to undermine and disrespect you.", "Nobody wants the waffle turn all soft, wd want some crispness, plus if she covers it with foil while hot, uhhh no.\nIm someone eho enjoys any kind of meat WELL DONE, but i dont want it turn to black wood.

You could easily turn it into a learning curve by telling her not to cover the waffles etc, walking away when it\u2019s your turn to cook and leaving it to her is super unfair and doesn\u2019t help the situation at all. She wants to help so just tell her what actually will help, don\u2019t let her do the wrong thing then complain about it", "[deleted]", "ESH  She should ask you what she can do to help rather than assume the two of you have some culinary synchronicity. You should offer direction and maybe even try to teach her since she\u2019s a horrible cook. It also sounds like she had a reason behind her actions. She was trying to keep the waffles warm. Maybe she\u2019s tired of eating cold waffles and is afraid the cook will yell at her if she makes a criticism.

She may not be good at cooking, but there\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t have a job, whether that\u2019s prep work, plating, etc. \n \nIt sounds like you\u2019re ignoring her reasons for wanting to be involved, and \u201cI want my food to taste good\u201d is a bad way to respond to that.", "ESH.

She might consider seeing an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor.\n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t dream of stepping in and painting on somebody else\u2019s canvas, especially while they\u2019re in the process of painting. For someone who really enjoys cooking, that\u2019s the same thing when someone decides to step in and \u201chelp\u201d in the kitchen. Different medium, but also art. Maybe your wife could understand that example.\n\nShe also needs to respect your boundaries. You\u2019ve asked her and told her ad nauseam. She\u2019s disrespecting your wishes by stepping in. She needs to cut it out!", "NTA at all. I would have lost my mind a long time ago. I commend you. Have you ever asked her why she has to \"help\"? Especially if you burn water (that made me laugh). My wife and I have identified our strengths and weaknesses early on, thank God, and we tend to let each other reign over our respective domains. One of mine is the kitchen. I cook well and my wife allows me to take the lead in the kitchen because I have formal training and love cooking (she can cook BTW). I can imagine the children saying, \"Aww man, Mom's \"helping\" again.\" LoL", "NTA your wife sounds exhausting to live with. If she cares so little about how food tastes/feels she can just heat herself a microwave meal for every meal every day.", "NTA. Maybe you should just tell her straight up, stop messing with food I'm cooking. She's not helping, she's ruining it. If she wants to help then she can go step by step with you as you make it but not go willy nilly throwing steaks back on the grill like she knows what shes doing because she doesnt and no one wants a burnt steak", "Id be annoyed af if my husband did this shit. I hate people commenting on how I'm doing in the kitchen even while I'm busy when i cook all our meals. My husband's little brother does this all the time when he himself doesn't cook! And my husband wld tell him to stfu because again he doesn't bloody cook! \n\nMy hubby helps and that's wonderful bt he only does chopping up veggies or peeling of them. That is all. \n\n\nI'd also walk away if i was OP. Let em do it themselves! NTA", "This is called \"hlep\".  It looks like help but it isn't.", "Yeah, I want to know if OP is actually communicating to the wife \"you are not being helpful, please stop\" when it happens, or just walking out silently and then blowing up when she finally asks why he keeps leaving? (I assume not, bc otherwise she would know why he keeps leaving!)", "Exactly.", "She'd still be mad. It seems he's explained she isn't helping multiple times before, she just doesn't care. So now he's given up on that route.", "> She\u2019s not stupid, she just doesn\u2019t know how to help.\n\nRandomly doing things to the food instead of asking how she can help is actually pretty stupid.", "Pretty clear it's nothing. If she wants to help best advice would be to do the dishes and clean afterwards.", "Maybe he doesn't want that, maybe cooking is his thing. You don't spend time with someone cooking, that's dumb. \n\nWould your response be the same if genders were switched? Doubt it.", "if the wife doesn\u2019t want \u201ccold or rare food\u201d she can make it herself or say that. OP has tried communicating but the wife doesn\u2019t care", "Then she can take HER portion of the food and do what she wants to it. Or cook for herself.", "You could have like... done a single google and saved yourself some embarrassment, man", "I'm usually very easygoing, but someone saying \"who cares about food tasting good\" would send me into an apoplectic rage.", "Forget smoothies, I want nutrient patches. Just slap one on and go, the only thing I\u2019m eating is the occasional stupendously amazing dessert.", "I'm a well done steak person. I have contamination ocd and the slightest pink in any meats (save salmon or something of course) freaks me out beyond any rational thought. Even though I know it's not blood too. But when my friend cooks steaks I trust him to make a decent one without turning it into shoe leather, and he does. \n\nI would go crazy having someone hover over me like this in the kitchen, and would hate to do it to anyone else too", "You can have it done for you, or you can have it done the way you like. You can\u2019t have both. That\u2019s the general rule we go by in my marriage with few exceptions and it has saved us SO MANY arguments.", "We call this \u201chalp\u201d.", "He said at the end that she thinks he's an asshole for caring about how food feels and tastes, which tells me that even if he we're to explain in clear detail for her how her \"help\" is not actually help, she wouldn't care because she doesn't have the same standards for food as him, and instead of respecting his standards for the food he is making himself, she'd rather pretend to help and act like it's a him problem when he gets frustrated at the end result of that help. It almost sounds like jealousy because she's probably well aware of her inability to cook more than microwave food, and is taking that out on her husband by making his food subpar so that she can feel better about her lack of skill, since he also said she surpasses him in basically every other aspect it sounds like she's trying to subtly ruin his cooking so she again feels better about being bad in that one aspect of their life, he's not allowed to be better at anything clearly.", "She says that he's an asshole for caring how the food feels and tastes. There is NO WAY she does not know that she's messing this up.", "Seems like he's communicated that multiple times, and is now at the point of just walking away.", "This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with gender. Don\u2019t you help your spouse in the kitchen? \n\nI personally prefer to help someone rather than let them slave away in the kitchen.", "She asked him why he always walks away when she helps in the kitchen . . . he was rude about her cooking skills and then he walked away again. She is communicating he is giving her the silent treatment.", "Can\u2019t really expect much from a fancy avocado\u2026", "Roscoe's chicken & waffles is a southern California institution.   A lot of good chicken and waffles in the bay area too!", "Yeah thats like eating a nice dinner and telling the cook \u201cthis tastes good but I really don\u2019t know why you try so hard, I don\u2019t really care about flavor\u201d", "orange, yellow, or . . . . . green?", "Soylent Green Is People!!!!", "I was around 6th grade when I realized others could see the math problems on the chalkboard, and I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to admit it at first, but finally got tired of asking and guessing. When I got my glasses (ugly things) I was blown away by seeing individual leaves and blades of grass!", "I got mine in 9th grade. My teacher asked me why I kept creeping up to the front row when she had the projector on. I told her it was so I could read what was on the screen. No one had noticed that I was having eye troubles because I can see close things perfectly clear and this was the first class that I was seated in the back.", "I got prescribed glasses in 4th grade but refused to wear them until freshman year in high school. Well I didn't actually wear them, I got contacts instead. Every year I just strained my vision and dealt with it. I vividly remember coming out of the drs with my contacts on, eyes irritated and dilated and all, and seeing the leaves on the trees through those funky shades they give you to wear temporarily. It was almost magical to see every single leaf on the tree, from the bottom all the way to the top, on every single branch. Super awesome lol", "I didnt get glasses till college when I realized I was getting headaches fairly often. I would usually sit in the front in class since I\u2019m short so it wasn\u2019t an issue.", "Use a pot, not a pan, super low heat, stir for seven million hours, and add in sour cream. Our first trip away together, my husband made scrambled eggs in a pot and I was like, \u201cUh\u2026why??? I thought he knew how to cook!\u201d His scrambled eggs are soft and fluffy and amazing and I have totally converted to his method lol", "He didn't explain what he thought she did wrong ( wrapping the waffles in foil) he just told her everything she does ruins food. Maybe this is the normal way she has seen anyone keep food warm.", "I am 45 and just read this. It's weird to have the radio and/or TV on at the same time as you do homework? I always did this growing up. I still will have multiple things going on (currently have a TV show running in the background as I scroll through the AITA threads). Never thought this was weird. BTW, I have never been tested for ADHD.", "I will try that, thank you! Hmmm\u2026that\u2019s another thing my partner likes to tell me. \u201cThere are other levels between Off and High, you know.\u201d", "I feel like anytime you throw in eggs, flour, butter, and some fruit, something good will come out.", "I cook and bake, and think baking is definitely harder. You have to be really exact with your measurements, timing, temperature, certain things can be over or under mixed.", "Baking is harder because it is a precise chemical process.  Mis-measure one thing or use the wrong temp or use the wrong ingredient (husband:  baking soda and baking powder are the same thing, right?  Me:  Um, NO!) or add something out of order and you end up with a hot lumpy mess that can take hours to clean up.  Cooking is a lot more forgiving.", "I\u2019m really intrigued by sous vide. Should I start with a whole machine or one of the stick things? Doing a turkey sounds amazing!", "I have an ANOVA and just use it in a regular tall pot most of the time. Eventually we got the big fancy plastic container so we could do bigger things and also longer periods of time because the lid keeps water from evaporating too much but tinfoil also does the trick. Some people also invest in a vacuum sealer but I haven't gone that far yet, lol.", "I prefer out machine because it has multiple functions and just looks nice on the counter when cooking vs a science experiment. Ours is by Oliso. It's an induction cooktop (smarthub) that has a separate insulated tub you can purchase. It's an expensive intro, but we got it on Kickstarter years ago.", "You know you're a bad cook when you catch water on fire..."]}
