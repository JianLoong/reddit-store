She is a smart and capable woman who leaves me on the dust in most categories. \n\nMy wife cannot cook. At all. She burned water once.  She was boiling water for rice and it had oil in it.  She got distracted and the water boiled off.  Then the oil caught fire. Then she threw water on it and nearly burned down her parents house. \n\nShe can follow instructions on microwave food. She can use the microwave to reheat leftovers. That's about it.  Her mom and dad gave up trying to teach her.  \n\nI love cooking. I enjoy making tasty meals from scratch when o have the time. \n\nOne of my go to meals is fried chicken thighs and waffles.  I use my dad's waffle recipe and they come out light and crispy. Perfect. \n\nI don't ways make them though because it takes time. I cheat sometimes and use premix. They are heavier and kind of floppy not crisp..\n\nSo I'm making breakfast yesterday and the kids are at the table. I have the chicken going and I'm making waffles. It's a good morning.  \n\nMy wife decided to \"help\" and covered the waffles in foil so they stayed warm. \n\nThey did. They also steamed and got soft. \n\nSo I finished making myself a waffle and served my food and left the kitchen.  She can finish everything off.  \n\nShe dies this constantly. I will be making steaks and I'm resting them and she throws them back on the grill to keep warm. \n\nI'll have the chicken fully cooked and tender and she will turn up the heat and dry it out \"just to make sure\". \n\nI am sure.  \n\nShe came up to me yester for the fiftieth time and asked why I always walk away when she tries to help. I explained for the fiftieth time that I enjoy making good food. And that her help is almost universally detrimental to the meal I'm trying to make.  \n\nShe thinks I'm an asshole for caring so much about how food feels and tastes. I think she can do whatever she wants on the days that it is her turn to cook.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678131055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kbads/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_kitchen_and_going_to/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Food has to taste good and feel good, what the hell, does she not have palate?!\n\nNTA", "NTA. I say this as someone whose partner once said, \u201cthe easiest way to turn a good steak into a piece of leather is to ask you to cook it.\u201d Some people need a LOT of time and practice to learn how to cook even simple things\u2026and still, they have a hard time. They CAN do it; it\u2019s not a case of weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s just *hard.*\n\nYour wife should be more accepting of the fact that you have your own way of cooking\u2014and to you, \u201cher way\u201d is not *different,* it is *wrong.* If she\u2019s the type of person who can accept criticism, then she should be able to accept this. If not, you got other problems.", "NTA. My husband and I both cook pretty well and often share duties in the kitchen. Thing is, we communicate. If I\u2019m in charge of the meal, he ASKS me what I need him to do. Same when he\u2019s in charge\u2026I ask what he needs. You say you\u2019ve had this argument repeatedly, but is it just you telling her that her \u201chelp\u201d is ruining the meal? Or have you tried sitting down with her when it\u2019s not mealtime and saying\u2026\n\n1. Honey, I appreciate that you want to help, but I\u2019ve got it. Please just go relax while I make dinner.\n\nOr 2. If you want to help, please ask me what I need you to do. Please stop just doing things because it stresses me out and it\u2019s not helpful.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done that and she still ignores you, then yes\u2026just walk away and let her finish.", "NTA. How many times should you have to explain that food is meant to be a certain way.  I'm not a food shop but I think she would drive me crazy.", "NTA\n\nShe summed it up perfectly. You care about how food tastes and feels. She does not. \n\nShe wants to help have her do prep work. Just keep her away from the heat.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd let's be clear: she's absolutely NOT trying to help. She's just interfering. If she actually, legitimately wanted to be of help, then she would come into the kitchen when you're cooking and say, \"How can I help?\" And listen to your responses, and follow through.\n\nBut she doesn't want to be helpful, she wants to control some aspect of what you're doing. So she interferes with your process. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Even if it literally means making the food significantly less tasty. And then she defends herself with the ridiculous argument that you . . . shouldn't care how food tastes. Which is about as illogical as it gets.\n\nYou are NTA, and you have addressed this about as kindly and thoughtfully as possible, because a lot of us would have gotten downright rude by now at what is at best her constant disruption and could arguably be deemed conscious sabotage on her part of your kitchen efforts. Gently, I would suggest that your wife needs therapy, to figure out why she CAN'T just ask you how she can be helpful, but rather needs to ACTIVELY INTERFERE anytime you try to cook. Is she jealous that you are a better cook? Does she just have control issues in general? Because SOMETHING is going on here. And in all of it, you are NTA.", "She doesn't respect your enjoyment for cooking or the boundaries you've set. very reasonable boundaries/", "NTA.   I would calmly undo whatever she is doing and ask her to leave the kitchen.   Tell her you are not trying to be mean, but if you wanted her help, you would ask for it and ask her if she would prefer to do all the cooking from now on.", "Nta if she wants to cook, then she can cook. If not, she needs to stop being in the way.\n\n\n She wants to help? She can set the table, get the drinks, make sure there are hot pads on the table.", "INFO - with the previous examples, what did you say to her about helping you?", "NTA. Next time she wants to help, tell her to ask first what you need help with so she doesn\u2019t ruin the food. Have to tried to teach her how to cook for, explaining what she does usually ruins the meal? Sometimes you gotta be brutally honest for people to get the point.", "So she knows that she cannot cook at all then purposely ruins your good food then tells you your overreacting? This sounds unbearable and I have no idea how you haven\u2019t snapped yet. I got pissed off just reading it fucking hell. NTA, she\u2019s a big one", "Encourage her to take cooking lessons.", "NTA\n\nAfter 50 times (or even the 20th time), it's you caring about the fact that she disrespects the boundaries you've set. That's your problem - not that you care too much about food feels and tastes. Pretty sure this is marital counseling territory. There's something to why she keeps doing this to you. It sounds intentional now.", "Lol definitely NTA. And thank you for not portraying your wife as an imbecile just because she fails so much at this one task. \n\nI know people like her and they are flat out not allowed near my stove anymore lmfao.", "NTA and the questions that you need to ask her is why is she intentionally sabotaging your hard work cooking? Because you\u2019ve told her to stop and that it doesn\u2019t help. A true loving partner would say sorry and stop. \n\nMy guess is she is jealous of the attention you get from the kids or people you are cooking for. Her weak excuse of nobody cares how it tastes is a load of bs. She\u2019s being borderline abusive and needs therapy to find out why she\u2019s so determined to undermine and disrespect you.", "Nobody wants the waffle turn all soft, wd want some crispness, plus if she covers it with foil while hot, uhhh no.\nIm someone eho enjoys any kind of meat WELL DONE, but i dont want it turn to black wood. It should still be soft.\nIf your wife wants to help, she should ask hpw she can help you first\ud83d\ude02NTA. and nobody likes their hard worl \"ruined\" , if it happens so regularly, its kinda disrespectful. I would redo MY serving after i tasted and didn tlike it thouth, bcs im especialy hard with meat thats not well done, its just disgusting for me.", "You\u2019re not an AH but you do suck in this situation. You could easily turn it into a learning curve by telling her not to cover the waffles etc, walking away when it\u2019s your turn to cook and leaving it to her is super unfair and doesn\u2019t help the situation at all. She wants to help so just tell her what actually will help, don\u2019t let her do the wrong thing then complain about it", "ESH - But you need to firmly communicate with her that you have things under control. Stop her when she is about to do something that will hurt the food and explain why you are asking her not to do it. \n\nIf that fails, just start being more and more blunt until she gets the message. \n\nThis passive-aggressive stuff is not helping.", "ESH  She should ask you what she can do to help rather than assume the two of you have some culinary synchronicity. You should offer direction and maybe even try to teach her since she\u2019s a horrible cook. It also sounds like she had a reason behind her actions. She was trying to keep the waffles warm. Maybe she\u2019s tired of eating cold waffles and is afraid the cook will yell at her if she makes a criticism. You\u2019re also in the wrong for going to play video games when your kids are still waiting on their food. So much for enjoying breakfast with the family.", "ESH, but you suck a bit more. Your wife should know by now that you know what you\u2019re doing and aren\u2019t going to be appreciative of any \u201chelp\u201d she provides. However, you should know by now that she wants to help, and should find ways to let her feel useful rather than snapping at her or just disconnecting. She may not be good at cooking, but there\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t have a job, whether that\u2019s prep work, plating, etc. \n \nIt sounds like you\u2019re ignoring her reasons for wanting to be involved, and \u201cI want my food to taste good\u201d is a bad way to respond to that.", "ESH.

I didn't complain because I was inadvertently taught it was normal.\n\nSecond story! My husband's aunt lost her sense of smell somehow. She can't cook to save her life.
