Until a few hours ago.\n\nI'm the oldest of 8. My youngest sibling, who we will call H, is 9 and has severe Downs Syndrome and several related developmental issues. They will never independent, or even able to be left unsupervised for more than 20 or 30 minutes. My other siblings are in and out of jail, addicts, and the most irresponsible bunch you've ever met. I have my shit together. Like, very together. I recently quit my job (that I absolutely hated) and moved halfway across the country to be with my bf. I do not regret this decision one bit. My mom wasn't thrilled but she likes my bf and his kid so she didn't throw too much of a fit.\n\nOver the summer we lost a few people in our family, including my Dad's brother to a major heart attack. My mom has been making sure all of the end of life preparations are in order for the two of them ever since. So yesterday when she drug him to the hospital for chest pains and he was having a heart attack she lost her shit. It wasn't 'bad' according to the doctor.\n\nShe called this morning to give me an update. Dad is totally fine. Flirting with his nurses and doctor and begging to be sent home. Even threatened to call an Uber if my mom doesn't give him his keys. Before we got off the phone she said she wanted to talk to my about what happens to H, when they can't take care of them anymore, later tonight. I asked her what her plans were so I had an idea of what to expect later and she said \"well you'll obviously have to take H. You know your brothers and sisters won't be able to handle H, even if they straighten their shit out and get helpful spouses.\"\n\nI told her I felt like that was a lot to throw on me and don't think that's something I can handle due to my mental health but we can continue to coming back to it as I progress. I have PTSD and similarly related (I'm not typing it all out - this is already long enough). The sound of a neighbors garage door slamming shut sent me into a panic so bad I practically climbed into the kitchen cabinet and my bf had to put me to bed.\n\nShe got upset and screamed at me that she never believed that crackpot doctor and that diagnosis is total BS, my manipulative bf probably paid the doctor to get it for me so I can get high on Xanax like my sister. That I'm an ungrateful and selfish daughter for turning my back on her and moving so far away and she regrets adopting me. I hung up and called my bf. She's sent me tons of text messages and Facebook messages explaining how I've betrayed her and our family and links to why siblings need to stay together when their parents die. I sent her a single message asking her \"is this still about H, or has this been about you the entire time?\" She responded with one word \"cunt\" and I was suddenly getting messages from my siblings and family, some of which I have never even spoken to. \n\nATIAH for moving away and not immediately agreeing to take my sister in when my parents die?", "created_utc": 1692376785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15upiy2/aitah_for_moving_states_and_not_agreeing_to_take/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please do not give in to this emotional blackmail.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your mother is so cruel. She doesn't get to unilaterally make this decision and force it upon you, \n\nHer inability to have a conversation with you and include you in this decision is her failure. It's a massive ask to take on, and one that requires care and consideration. \n\nThen again, you're welcome to \"prove her right\" and show how \"selfish\" you are by saying no and then being done with her. (None of that would make you selfish; it's important to protect yourself so you can be healthy and people like her get SO angry when their gas lighting and manipulation don't work.)", "NTA. She was allowed you ask, and you answered. She needs to accept that answer. You are not obligated to take on the care of your sibling, who will *forever* need care. I know this must be a bombshell to her, but she needs to shift her focus into looking into and figuring out the best care for her son in the eventual event of their death and / or inability for care for him. THAT is the responsible thing to do.", "Omg I am so sorry NTA\n\nYour mother's behavior is wrong, hurtful and unhinged. That is just awful. I am so sorry. She's probably stressed right now. For parents of severely disabled children thinking about what happens to them when they die is really upsetting, and that reality is clear after your dad's heart attack. That's absolutely not an excuse for her horrible actions and words but an explanation.\n\nYou do not and should not take H if.you don't want to. That is a HUGE commitment to take on and you'd never be able to be yourself fully. Additionally if your bf has a child and you see yourself with him long term- taking H could be detrimental to his child. Kids who grow up with disabled siblings (as i am sure you are aware) can be really really difficult as the non disabled child has to always be put second or third no matter what. All children should feel like they are a priority. \n\nAs for the issue at hand- rather than having H live with you your parents could find her a group home when the time is right and you could be one of her guardians (if you're comfortable). That way you'd have the legal right and responsibility to make decisions for H but not actually be responsible. If you are uncomfortable with this there are plenty of paid guardianship services out there for this very thing- it would just likely impact your inheritance- I imagine for you that wouldn't be an issue.\n\nI wish you the best of luck OP. This is tough shit, but you didn't deserve this treatment. Keep up being an awesome person.", "NTA!! However block them all... you don't owe them anything.", "NTA\n\nYou can't sacrifice your future.\n\nYour parents should be looking into group homes or other facilities where H would be comfortable living. They should be consulting with social workers, H's physician, and support organizations.", "NTA. Put on your own oxygen mask and prioritize yourself. Your mother may be stressed out but that is not an excuse to be so cruel to you. You do not owe any obligations to be a caretaker for life. Her kid, she needs to figure out her own shit and not count on dumping them on you. Hold your boundaries and do not give in.", "Wow, that escalated quickly. Bottom line is that you've got to take care of yourself before you can take care of anyone else. Especially in a situation like this where the person - your sibling - who will never be independent, you need to think long and hard about your ability to take care of them.\n\nJust because you have your shit together professionally doesn't mean you're the best option to take your sibling. Your sibling is your mom's responsibility, so she should be doing everything she can to ensure her child is taken care of. That means looking into homes and care facilities, and setting aside money to pay for them.\n\nEven if your mom thought you might step in, her over-the-top response to your natural reluctance - name-calling, shit-talking, and family messaging - is not the best way to convince you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It sounds like there is actually a lot more at work in your story and personal  history then you can even possible express or acknowledge. Thank god you moved across country and away from your family. Don't sign up to be the care giver for your sister. Live your own life and don't look back. And I agree, block all of them. Walk away now while you still can.", "How did that work that you are the oldest and adopted?\n\nNTA--they decided to continue the pregnancy that they were likely told ahead of time the issues that the child would have. Your mother seems abusive and it seems likely she did not do a great job raising your other siblings because she does not know how to be a good parent, or she ignored all the rest of her kids to take care of the one with special needs. \n\nIt is understandable that she is upset, but the way she spoke to you is absolutely unacceptable. She is disappointed because she obviously thought you would be there to take on this HUGE responsibility, but that is her own issue. She needs to find alternative arrangements or start looking into what options are available through disability services.", "NTA. You have to make choices for you, first. You also dont have a responsibility for H. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are right when you called her out for it being all about her, she has main character energy. It might be beneficial to cut contacts with everyone for your own sanity.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is awful and this is not your responsibility. If you can help your sibling that would be great, but you can\u2019t be expected to do that, especially when your mom is so abusive and ungrateful", "NTA - he is not your responsibility", "NTA and LOL\u2026aren\u2019t you glad you moved out and left CRAZY behind?  Now don\u2019t backpedal and take sibling with you.  No one needs to be the handicapped attendant/martyr\u2026", "NTA. I'm gonna give mama some grace because she is obviously stressed out and panicky, but I think may be a good time to STAY halfway across the country, and lower your contact with mom. She does not get to use one kid as a resource to take care of another kid (or kids). You are not obligated to give up your life plan for your sibling.", "NTA and time to go no contact with all of them. Enjoy your life and work on healing.", "NTA. Your mother was severely out of line, but I'm giving her a pass because she must be under a lot of strain, right now. It's not fair on the other siblings, but it must be terrifying to feel your own mortality while caring for a severely disabled child, and not know what's going to happen to them when you die.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if there is absolutely nothing wrong with your mental health and you are fit and stable, you are completely justified to say that H is not your responsibility and that you will not upend your life to be their caregiver. \n\nMy only advice would be to cut contact with all those people who are lashing out at you, your mother especially. I know that hurts, but at this point you know that staying in contact will hurt more. Stay far, far away from them, They only want to use you.
