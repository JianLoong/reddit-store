She doesn't get to unilaterally make this decision and force it upon you, \n\nHer inability to have a conversation with you and include you in this decision is her failure. It's a massive ask to take on, and one that requires care and consideration. \n\nThen again, you're welcome to \"prove her right\" and show how \"selfish\" you are by saying no and then being done with her. (None of that would make you selfish; it's important to protect yourself so you can be healthy and people like her get SO angry when their gas lighting and manipulation don't work.)", "NTA. She was allowed you ask, and you answered. She needs to accept that answer. You are not obligated to take on the care of your sibling, who will *forever* need care. I know this must be a bombshell to her, but she needs to shift her focus into looking into and figuring out the best care for her son in the eventual event of their death and / or inability for care for him. THAT is the responsible thing to do.", "Omg I am so sorry NTA\n\nYour mother's behavior is wrong, hurtful and unhinged. That is just awful. I am so sorry. She's probably stressed right now. For parents of severely disabled children thinking about what happens to them when they die is really upsetting, and that reality is clear after your dad's heart attack. That's absolutely not an excuse for her horrible actions and words but an explanation.\n\nYou do not and should not take H if.you don't want to. That is a HUGE commitment to take on and you'd never be able to be yourself fully. Additionally if your bf has a child and you see yourself with him long term- taking H could be detrimental to his child. Kids who grow up with disabled siblings (as i am sure you are aware) can be really really difficult as the non disabled child has to always be put second or third no matter what. All children should feel like they are a priority. \n\nAs for the issue at hand- rather than having H live with you your parents could find her a group home when the time is right and you could be one of her guardians (if you're comfortable). That way you'd have the legal right and responsibility to make decisions for H but not actually be responsible. If you are uncomfortable with this there are plenty of paid guardianship services out there for this very thing- it would just likely impact your inheritance- I imagine for you that wouldn't be an issue.\n\nI wish you the best of luck OP.

However block them all... you don't owe them anything.", "NTA\n\nYou can't sacrifice your future.\n\nYour parents should be looking into group homes or other facilities where H would be comfortable living. They should be consulting with social workers, H's physician, and support organizations.", "NTA. Put on your own oxygen mask and prioritize yourself. Your mother may be stressed out but that is not an excuse to be so cruel to you. You do not owe any obligations to be a caretaker for life. Her kid, she needs to figure out her own shit and not count on dumping them on you. Hold your boundaries and do not give in.", "Wow, that escalated quickly. Bottom line is that you've got to take care of yourself before you can take care of anyone else. Especially in a situation like this where the person - your sibling - who will never be independent, you need to think long and hard about your ability to take care of them.\n\nJust because you have your shit together professionally doesn't mean you're the best option to take your sibling. Your sibling is your mom's responsibility, so she should be doing everything she can to ensure her child is taken care of. That means looking into homes and care facilities, and setting aside money to pay for them.\n\nEven if your mom thought you might step in, her over-the-top response to your natural reluctance - name-calling, shit-talking, and family messaging - is not the best way to convince you.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Walk away now while you still can.", "How did that work that you are the oldest and adopted?\n\nNTA--they decided to continue the pregnancy that they were likely told ahead of time the issues that the child would have. Your mother seems abusive and it seems likely she did not do a great job raising your other siblings because she does not know how to be a good parent, or she ignored all the rest of her kids to take care of the one with special needs. \n\nIt is understandable that she is upset, but the way she spoke to you is absolutely unacceptable. She is disappointed because she obviously thought you would be there to take on this HUGE responsibility, but that is her own issue.

However, you need to not offer an explanation\\\\excuse with respect to why you have decided you will not take in the event of your parents\u2018 unavailability. even having the legal authority to determine your siblings, housing, healthcare, and overall living conditions is a significant responsibility in and of itself. before you give your parents a final decision with respect to becoming a guardian, try calling your local or state department of health services to find out more information about the obligations that come with becoming a guardian. Part of that decision involves in what state your sibling will live, even if in a group home. If you make an informed decision to offer to be your youngest sibling\u2019s guardian someday, and your parents decline that offer and insist that you personally take care of your sibling, then you can make it clear to everyone that your offer was fair and appropriate and if they disagree with it, they can sign up in your stead.", "NTA", "\n\n>I need to start by saying I've had a fantastic relationship with my family\n\nI'm not entirely sure that's true. or at the very least, it was more one sided than your realized.

It is not your responsibility to take care of your sibling unless you decide you want to take this on!!  I would suggest telling your mother that you are going no contact until she starts treating you with respect (if my mom had called me that, she would have died alone) and consideration.  \n\nTo be honest, if you sibling has Down's that severely, a group home may be their only option, unless you volunteer.  But, again that is up to you. Good luck.", "NTA. Block her. God, I can just imaging why you have PTSD.", "NTA- I don\u2019t know your childhood but I\u2019m gonna assume if you have ptsd and many siblings in active addiction, that y\u2019all had a rough childhood. Please temporarily block her while you work with a therapist to work on your trauma", "Your mother called you a cunt?? Wow.\n\nNTA and I\u2019d go no contact forever over that. That\u2019s the height of disrespect.", "NTA. I\u2019d have moved away too. Now it\u2019s time to go No contact.", "Wow!   If this is how your 'mother' reacts to a simple 'I'll think about it' I can't imagine what it was like to grow up with her.  I can kind of see how she raised a bunch of addicts if this is how she treats people.\n\nYou do not owe her anything.   You do not owe H anything.   You didn't give birth to her.  To be frank, I'd completely cut off that entire family (at least the ones that are butting in) and live my best life without ever thinking of them again.  You deserve better than this.\n\nYou're NTA.   She is.  They are.", "NTA She needs to be making real long-term care plans.", "NTA. Sounds like you need to move further away. And go LC or NC for a while.", "NTA and feel free to not deal with her.  \n\nIt\u2019s her job to make arrangements for H.", "NTA period.  This oversight is completely their fault they've had years to save up money for his future put their life insurance policy in his name and let that take care of him.", "NTA Wow, your mom is a piece of work!!! So much toxic bs in that one phone call! I would block their numbers and focus on your mental well being. You don\u2019t owe them your life because they adopted you.", ">I recently quit my job (that I absolutely hated) and moved halfway across the country to be with my bf.\n\nStep 1. Step 2 Change your phone number. NTA.", "Wow your mom is a lot of unpleasant things. I can see why your siblings have so much trouble and you, the functional one, moved as far away as you can.\n\nNTA", "Sad to say, but it looks like OP's mom thought she had adopted herself a nurse and is furious she decided to be independent instead.", "> \"well you'll obviously have to take H. \n\nShe didn't ask.", "> sometimes people adopt bc they have been told biological kids won't happen then that's proved wrong\n\nhappens A LOT - my ex boyfriend was adopted for this reason then they got pregnant w his sister", "So let me get this straight: \n\nYour parents, not having any knowledge of contraception, had 8 children, too many it seems to raise properly. As the older, you have probably had to take responsibility for younger siblings, and so had to grow up quickly - leading to having your life in order.\n\nNow your parents feels that it is your duty to save them from mistakes they could have avoided? As I understand it, your parents were quite old to have the youngest one, right? And that makes the odd of birth defects magnitudes higher. Most sensible people would have chosen to have an abortion under these circumstances - being older and knowing that the child would need care for the rest of it's life, and with your family history.... It was a no brainer. But religion, right?\n\nYou are entitled to start your own life with a clean slate, not having to be burdened by their choices.\n\nI am sure your youngest sibling is a wonderful child, but he is a problem in the future, and he should not be yours.\n\nLive your best life, avoid the mistakes of your parents, and good luck!\n\nNTA", "NTA. She called you a cunt. Block her and go NC. She can pay for a care home. You're not her servant, and you're not obligated to do Shit for her.", "[removed]", "Not only no, you're NTA, but hell no. I'd block them all.", "Humans should not have 8 children if they can't take care of them.  \n\nWasn't your egg.  Not your problem", "NTA.\n\nOh, no. No no **no**.\n\nWhen she screamed at you and called you a cunt? It's over. OVER.\n\nShe's got some severe emotional issues going on, but they are her issues. Only hers and so leave her alone to deal with it.  I can't speak for you, but if my mom called me that name - or any other, said she was sorry I was her kid?  She would never see me again. \n\nI'm so sorry for how awful this all feels, but she's unhinged. Thank God you are all the way across the country from this shitshow.", "NTA. It's your life.", "Oh, babe, you moved just in the nick. \n\nSounds like H needs a group home. Your family will have to set that up. \n\nNTA.\n\nCurious ... how many of your siblings are adopted?", "NTA X 1000!\n\nThe best thing you can do for H's future is be 100 percent honest NOW. You are not obligated to be her caretaker for the rest of your life. If it is not what you want to do, stick to your guns. That gives the woman who adopted you time to make other plans. \n\nAs far as the piece where you moved, no way in the world was that wrong. Children have been moving away since the time when home was a cave and the closest thing to a city was a shared fire. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. But wow, your mother went over the top with all that invective against you. How do you come back from that?? If it were me, I'd never speak to her again unless she apologized so earnestly that her sincerity could be seen from SPACE.", "Obv NTA.  \n\n\nOMFG H is THEIR child and thus THEIR responsibility, not yours. They should have been putting a plan in place for taking care of H when they are gone. What a crock of sh\\*t to lay this all on you. I hope you can just block them all out of your life because they are just jealous of your sanity and success. Good Luck1", "NTA. My dad\u2019s brother is severely mentally challenged (he could never stay home alone). He went into a group home when he turned 18. A lot of them are very good. My family is a huge advocate for group homes because my uncle is around other people, is not burdening my grandparents from living a life, he is busy doing activities during the day, and he has caretakers 24/7 who are trained for this. I\u2019m not telling you what to do, just sharing my family\u2019s experience", "NTA. H given 32 & 9 ... the sibling might out live OP as well. ? And then what? Hope the next eldest finally has their shit together & can take over?\n\nUgh.", "NTA\n\n>She got upset and screamed at me\n\n>I'm an ungrateful and selfish daughter for turning my back on her and moving so far away and she regrets adopting me. \n\n> She responded with one word \"cunt\"\n\nTell this woman to get fucked. I'm so mad on your behalf right now. YOU should be angry. Someone you have a \"fantastic relationship\" with would *never* treat you like this, even if you have a disagreement.", "Exactly. Mom shot herself in the foot. What an evil woman.. who does that?\n\nOP is NTA.
