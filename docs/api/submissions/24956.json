Please do not give in to this emotional blackmail.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your mother is so cruel. She doesn't get to unilaterally make this decision and force it upon you, \n\nHer inability to have a conversation with you and include you in this decision is her failure. It's a massive ask to take on, and one that requires care and consideration. \n\nThen again, you're welcome to \"prove her right\" and show how \"selfish\" you are by saying no and then being done with her. (None of that would make you selfish; it's important to protect yourself so you can be healthy and people like her get SO angry when their gas lighting and manipulation don't work.)", "NTA. She was allowed you ask, and you answered. She needs to accept that answer. You are not obligated to take on the care of your sibling, who will *forever* need care. I know this must be a bombshell to her, but she needs to shift her focus into looking into and figuring out the best care for her son in the eventual event of their death and / or inability for care for him. THAT is the responsible thing to do.", "Omg I am so sorry NTA\n\nYour mother's behavior is wrong, hurtful and unhinged. That is just awful. I am so sorry. She's probably stressed right now. For parents of severely disabled children thinking about what happens to them when they die is really upsetting, and that reality is clear after your dad's heart attack. That's absolutely not an excuse for her horrible actions and words but an explanation.\n\nYou do not and should not take H if.you don't want to. That is a HUGE commitment to take on and you'd never be able to be yourself fully. Additionally if your bf has a child and you see yourself with him long term- taking H could be detrimental to his child. Kids who grow up with disabled siblings (as i am sure you are aware) can be really really difficult as the non disabled child has to always be put second or third no matter what. All children should feel like they are a priority. \n\nAs for the issue at hand- rather than having H live with you your parents could find her a group home when the time is right and you could be one of her guardians (if you're comfortable). That way you'd have the legal right and responsibility to make decisions for H but not actually be responsible. If you are uncomfortable with this there are plenty of paid guardianship services out there for this very thing- it would just likely impact your inheritance- I imagine for you that wouldn't be an issue.\n\nI wish you the best of luck OP. This is tough shit, but you didn't deserve this treatment. Keep up being an awesome person.", "NTA!! However block them all... you don't owe them anything.", "NTA\n\nYou can't sacrifice your future.\n\nYour parents should be looking into group homes or other facilities where H would be comfortable living. They should be consulting with social workers, H's physician, and support organizations.", "NTA. Put on your own oxygen mask and prioritize yourself. Your mother may be stressed out but that is not an excuse to be so cruel to you. You do not owe any obligations to be a caretaker for life. Her kid, she needs to figure out her own shit and not count on dumping them on you. Hold your boundaries and do not give in.", "Wow, that escalated quickly. Bottom line is that you've got to take care of yourself before you can take care of anyone else. Especially in a situation like this where the person - your sibling - who will never be independent, you need to think long and hard about your ability to take care of them.\n\nJust because you have your shit together professionally doesn't mean you're the best option to take your sibling. Your sibling is your mom's responsibility, so she should be doing everything she can to ensure her child is taken care of. That means looking into homes and care facilities, and setting aside money to pay for them.\n\nEven if your mom thought you might step in, her over-the-top response to your natural reluctance - name-calling, shit-talking, and family messaging - is not the best way to convince you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It sounds like there is actually a lot more at work in your story and personal  history then you can even possible express or acknowledge.

Walk away now while you still can.", "How did that work that you are the oldest and adopted?\n\nNTA--they decided to continue the pregnancy that they were likely told ahead of time the issues that the child would have. Your mother seems abusive and it seems likely she did not do a great job raising your other siblings because she does not know how to be a good parent, or she ignored all the rest of her kids to take care of the one with special needs. \n\nIt is understandable that she is upset, but the way she spoke to you is absolutely unacceptable. She is disappointed because she obviously thought you would be there to take on this HUGE responsibility, but that is her own issue. She needs to find alternative arrangements or start looking into what options are available through disability services.", "NTA. You have to make choices for you, first.

There is nothing wrong with excepting legal responsibility for them upon the death of your parents or their inability to exercise parental authority.

However, you need to not offer an explanation\\\\excuse with respect to why you have decided you will not take in the event of your parents\u2018 unavailability. even having the legal authority to determine your siblings, housing, healthcare, and overall living conditions is a significant responsibility in and of itself. before you give your parents a final decision with respect to becoming a guardian, try calling your local or state department of health services to find out more information about the obligations that come with becoming a guardian. Part of that decision involves in what state your sibling will live, even if in a group home. If you make an informed decision to offer to be your youngest sibling\u2019s guardian someday, and your parents decline that offer and insist that you personally take care of your sibling, then you can make it clear to everyone that your offer was fair and appropriate and if they disagree with it, they can sign up in your stead.", "NTA", "\n\n>I need to start by saying I've had a fantastic relationship with my family\n\nI'm not entirely sure that's true. or at the very least, it was more one sided than your realized.
