She's recently brought it up again and stated she was only sorry I was upset but not about anything else as she sees nothing wrong with what happened and I'm just over reacting.\n\nWhat's the story? My wife, sister and sister in law were planning to go out and have drinks one night and after asking if I wanted to go, and accepting, they decided they just wanted to have girls night and unceremoniously revoked my invitation. Not a problem, it was a Sunday night and I don't handle hangovers as well as I used to, so I saw them off and settled in for the night.\n\nA few hours later I get a phone call from wife stating they are leaving the bar and going to the casino with SILs boyfriend. I asked what happened to the girls night and was told they wanted to meet him. I told her I felt a bit hard done by since my invitation to the night was revoked under the guise of a girls night, but ultimately left the conversation there and offered to pick then up later if they needed a lift home. I was awoken in the early hours of the morning to my wife coming home and apologising for what happened. I was taken aback as it seemed to be a, rarely seen, sincere apology. I accepted it and went to sleep happy and never brought up the subject again.\n\nJust recently, wife was planning another girls night at a friend's place and stated \"knowing my friend, i wouldn't be surprised if guys show up\". I asked if that was the norm for her friend and she replied that she hadn't had a girls night there before and she was just forewarning me so I don't get upset again. After saying she wasn't actually sorry for the previous time, it quickly turned into an argument of \"you're getting mad over nothing\" and \"how would you like it if I exclude you from group events\". \n\nAlthough we are both pretty hot headed at times, usually there's a patch of grey in arguments we have.

If other men go, it's not a girls' night anymore, and she just doesn't want you around but uses you being a man an excuse for not being welcomed. \n\nShe's being childish. She could just say she wants a night out with her friends instead of making sht up and then blaming you for getting frustrated over her behavior.", "NTA. She seems overly defensive for an innocent person.", "NTA. Seems super weird, I would think more is going on here. You handled all the events you described with maturity, still feels like there is something missing, this one doesn't make full sense. Maybe talk to the SIL husbando.", "NTA.\n\nIf they invite other guys, it's obviously not a girls night. It's strange then that she doesn't want you to be a part of it. Ask her why she doesn't want you to come. I am guessing you have a good or atleast decent relationship with the other ladies. Did one of them ask for you not to be invited?\n\nOpen communication around this should resolve this.", "   Hold the phone, plan changed to now guys are along for the evening, did she call and say it is no longer a girl's night do you want to meet us at the casino??  Nope, she just called to say that we're going with guys to the casino. \n\n  Now she is planning a girl's night but tells you in  advance that she wouldn't be surprised if her friends have guys attend?!?! \n\nSomething is not adding up here. You are being excluded on purpose. She is fooling around on some level , even if it is just flirting with guys. Are you sure it was ever a girl's night? Have your sister in or SIL mentioned that they were sorry for uninviting you and then the bf coming along? \n\n  The problem with completely trusting someone is it gives them room to go off the rails without anyone being the wiser. Her actions scream guilty conscience to me.\n\nI don't think you reacted badly to girls night, on that you are NTA.   I don't even think that is the question here. \n\nI think the real question you wanted to ask is Am I the Ass Hole for Being upset that my wife attended girls night  that turned into a mixed company outing after I was uninvited so it could be a girl's night??  Still not the AH.   Something is fishy here. I think you need to dig deeper into this.", "NTA, this whole thing gives me a bad vibe. It may be nothing, but I would keep my mind open to all possibilities. First you were right to be upset because you were initially invited and then uninvited because she wanted a \u201cgirls night.\u201d The fact that it was not a girls night makes your feelings valid. What concerns me is the initial heartfelt apology, like she really felt bad about something, that has now turned into her not feeling bad at all and saying it\u2019s all right if she goes on a \u201cgirls night\u201d and guys show up, just not you.", "NTA\n\nWhile there's no way to control when there's a sudden change of plans, a decision to leave for the casino especially late at night is indicative that she's okay not including you in her circles especially because she made the apology only in a superficial way and didn't mind the SIL's boyfriend sudden plan and now doesn't mind if one of her friends brings in guys. \n\nShe's flexible outside but has different rules with you, thinks its fine to treat you as a pushover.\n\nTime to evaluate if you'd want to hang out with her circle at all in the future.", "INFO: What were your \u201coverly protective\u201d sister\u2019s thoughts on the night?", "NTA, but I think people are quick to jumping to 'she's fucking other dudes' territory so ridiculously early here, because of course Reddit is.\n\nPeople are suggesting she's cheating or flirting while *your sister is present*. That makes no sense. My SO has girlfriends who try to do girl's nights all the time, sometimes one girl doesn't get the memo and brings a boyfriend. It was a dick move of her to not invite you to the casino when plans changed, but that's really that unless she intentionally pushed for the guy to come.\n\nThe second example of her voicing that \"knowing my friend, i wouldn't be surprised if guys show up\" can be seen as ranting and pointing to her friend as ruining girls night routinely because she doesn't get it, or something. There's always that one girl who brings her boyfriends/husband to these 'girl nights' in every friend group, and her voicing that but not bringing you likely isn't a slight to you, but just an acknowledgement that someone may potentially ruin it, but she isn't going to preemptively ruin it by intentionally bringing you along.\n\nNow, as for the apology aspect and rescinding it. You're in the right here, it was a dick move of your wife to not invite you as soon as plans fell through, especially seeing as she alerted you that they were moving locations and a guy was present. It's also a dick move of her to invalidate your feelings about being left out, if my fianc\u00e9e had plans with my sisters and hers, and it went from group plans to girl's night, and one of the sisters brought a boyfriend/husband, she'd feel really sorry that I missed out one something because someone ruined it. \n\nI'm not going to go as far as saying she's cheating, trying to cheat, etc, especially considering the man in question in the first instance was her sister's boyfriend and your sister was there, but she does seem to not really care how you feel and seems to feel it's okay to exclude you. I think that this is more of a conversation of why she doesn't seem to want you around, as that's how it seems to you, and her invalidating your feelings makes you more upset.", "NTA. It's not about girls night, it's about disregarding you. It's not \"we don't want you at girls night\", it's \"we're having girls night, but men will be there, so it's really just *you* we don't want there\".\n\nAnd if she can't see why that's wrong, why you'd be hurt or why she should apologise? You have bigger problems than \"girls night\" in your relationship.", "NTA and are you sure that she is not stepping out?  The lady doth protest too much.  And I don't for a minute believe that she didn't know the SIL's boyfriend would be there or that there would be guys at this other party.  She seems to be putting herself in the position of single woman about town.\n\nBut assuming she's not stepping out, she's treating you very disrespectfully.  I'm a little concerned that you view it as a \"rarely seen sincere apology.\"\n\nCommunication seems to be a problem in your relationship.  Have you considered couples counseling to work on it?  You might because it feels like this is only going to get worse.", "NTA. Did you ascertain exactly what she was sorry about?  Was the apology for your invitation being rescinded specifically or a generic \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d?  Could she have drunkenly been apologetic for another occurrence that night?  Something has my spidey senses tingling here.", "NAH if I\u2019m understanding her correctly, what she\u2019s saying is that these things are *meant* to be girls nights, but that sometimes one of the girls (like the SIL) are codependent and can\u2019t go a whole night without involving their bf. All of us have friends like this lol.\n\nShe excluded you with the intentions of it being a girls night, but your SIL changed those plans once they were already all there. That\u2019s not really within your wife\u2019s control, and it shouldn\u2019t really be that big of a deal to you. Unless you expected her to call you and invite you halfway through the night I guess?\n\nIt\u2019s probably very annoying for the other women who would prefer having a true girls night once in awhile.", "You should wonder what the truth here is.\n\nWhat is the best case scenario here? Your wife is giving company to her dating friend? Possible.\n\nWhat is the worst case scenario? What is the most likely scenario?\n\nShe is hanging out with dudes and lying about it under false pretenses.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you handled the first situation pretty well. Sometimes plans change or there is miscommunication and you are welcome to feel frustrated by it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife's comment about this next party is just strange. It sounds like she knows guys are going to show up but is telling you it is a girls night. Her behavior at this point seems shady. If she was worried it's not a girl's night by this friends standards a simple text could confirm the intentions with the party.", "You were uninvited as it was changed *into* a Girls Night Out. Ok so far annoying but whatever. Then they mid-GNO are meeting up with one of the girls boyfriend.\n\nNTA and some red flags", "NTA... you have every right to be upset that your wife is giving you a heads up that guys might be there at another girls' night event to which you are excluded. Especially after they met up with one on the previous girls' night. I just had a girls' day with 2 of my friends back in June  I told my husband all our plans and since one of my girl friends is married to my guy friend, almost like a brother, and we planned to go back to their house, he said if you see him tell him I said hi. If you are aware of the possibility, it wouldn't be as upsetting but being excluded twice from events where guys could be. I  can see being upsetting.", "INFO- Do you go out with your friends?", ">Just recently, wife was planning another girls night at a friend's place and stated \"knowing my friend, i wouldn't be surprised if guys show up\n\nHow is it a girls night if she's already mentioning that her friend will likely have guys show up???? She already knows this is likely to happen, so it's not a \"girls night\" but a party.", "NTA\n\n\n\nWhat I think happened is that she WAS genuinely remorseful that night - \n and after that she talked to her friends who convinced her she had nothing to be sorry for and she changed her stance.\n\nIs it possible that someone in her circle don't like you? Maybe SIL? Or maybe your sister who was also in the group is uncomfortable getting drunk around you (I know a few siblings who are like that)? \n\nI do think you should ask her the real reason (which I don't think is cheating, why does reddit always jump to cheating??) - and try to understand/fix/ work on that. \n\nIt's also possible that SIL suddenly insisted that her BF was gonna come and she couldn't refuse, but that meant she could have asked you to come to the casino as well... But she didn't. Which sucks. She should be more sensitive to your feelings.", "NTA....  sorry but she's clearly in the wrong. She knows full well they did you dirty on the first \"girls night\" and now she's planning on attending a party with a bunch of guys and complaining you expressed misgivings..... She should either start respecting boundaries or start packing her bags.", "NTA\n\nIf guys routinely show up to girls night but you magically arent allowed, then the relationships trust is in serious consideration. It then sounds like she wants to be around other guys when drunk and doesnt want you to see how she and her friends behave. This practice would end immediately.", "NTA\n\nFuck that noise. So other men are okay but you aren't? Once is a mistake, twice is intentional. Id be gone when she came back.", "This smells like cheating ngl NTA", "She\u2019s getting dicked down on girls\u2019 night", "INFO: if she said she wanted a night out by herself with friends but didn't call it a girls night would you be OK with that? \n\nJust gauging if you're upset she went out without you or if it's because she wasn't upfront in saying she wanted a night to herself.", "NTA.. She can't rescind on the invite and then reset the rules. Your wife's excuse regarding her friend's boyfriend being there and you not, is extremely questionable. At that point, your wife should've asked you to meet them, if she really wanted you there. The fact she admitted she wasn't really sorry he previous time is a sign she didn't want you there regardless.", " NTA and your wife should absolutely take your feelings into consideration, but I don't really think she's an A H either. I will say there were many times that were supposed to be \"girls' nights,\" but at least one of the girls' partners showed up or tagged along. It wasn't something most of the ladies wanted, but we just went along with it. I'd like to say this was more of an issue when I was younger, but it still happens. There's a few reasons why we accept it, one being that there's a slight fear sometimes. Sometimes, we realize that if we don't accept the partner, then we'd never see our friend. Something that was more common when I was younger is that sometimes it's the girl who we don't want to upset by telling her not to bring her boyfriend. \n\nI'm so grateful my husband has always respected my wishes and never showed up or invited himself along when I wanted to have a girls night, and of course I respect when chooses to hang out with the guys too.", "NTA\n\nThis is once again one of those situations where OPs partner is running around.\n\nAt this point I would seriously consider the relationship pretty much done and prepare privately for that.\n\nOnce you are prepared, turn it around on her. \n\nHave a \"guy's night out\" with your friends where they all bring their partners and \"just happen\" to run into some of their friends who just happen to be attractive and available.\n\nBonus points if you end up having a 3-way like your wife did that first night out.", "Something fishy is going on. She says it a girls night the first time but then the SIL boyfriend shows up. That\u2019s not too bad. Now she wants another girls night but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if guys show up.

And then watch her face.  \n\nI hate to say it, but if she is shutting this down in an unusually vehement way, I wonder if she is enjoying the attention from the guys.", "Your wife is lying to you about other things and could even be cheating on you.

Probably not.\n\nThe latter example, of her saying 'oh I wouldn't be surprised if she brings a guy' could easily be seen as her just ranting about her friend for not understanding girls night and ruining it every time by bringing a guy, but she is going into it with the belief that it will be a girl's night instead of preemptively inviting her SO as well. \n\nShe's an asshole for being inconsiderate of her SO and for trying to downplay his reasonable emotions on the topic, but to try and throw out that she's flirting or attempting to cheat on OP is a bit of a stretch given the information we have to deal with here.", "Thank you for the award! My first award!  Have a fantastic day!", "\\>She seems to be putting herself in the position of single woman about town.\n\nOkay I keep seeing this whole 'she's trying to cheat' thing, but people are overlooking the fact that OP's sister was there the whole time. Who tf tries to cheat on their SO with their sibling present?\n\nThis hypothesis would have more merit if the sister wasn't there, but with that piece of the puzzle in place it's just hard for me to buy that the SO is trying to cheat.", "Your right this has happened with certain friends of mine on girls nights, doesn't mean anything bad is going on", ">attending a party with a bunch of guys and complaining you expressed misgivings\n\nLol what? There was mention of one guy *potentially* coming to the party, what's this 'She's going to a fuck fest with all these hot single dudes' bullshit haha.", "Grownups can have plans change while out and she fucking called him while out when the did. Fuck your own noise", "With his sister right there? Seems unlikely", "Or at least likes the idea that she could if she wanted to. Its just a matter of time", "I'm totally fine her going out without me, and I'm usually the lift to and from wherever she's going if shes drinking so she doesn't have to worry about designated drivers or paying for taxis.\n\nIt just bothered me that I was uninvited in favor of having a girls night and the idea was abandoned when another guy wanted to join them half way through.", "Shes an AH for revolking her apology. And if guys are a possibility why not her guy? Shes being deceitful", "But what about her dangling \"knowing my friend I wouldn't be surprised if guys show up\" in front of OP's face. It's clear that she at least wants him to be worried about potential disloyalty, if she isn't actually committing infidelity.", "Redditors are wayy too dramatic", "I initially downvoted this because you called him TA for no reason. He did nothing wrong. But your advice is sound. He needs his own friends. Stop staying in when shes out. Go out and have fun. Have his own stories to tell, etc.", "Yeah I hope he goes out with his girlfriend as soon as the wife goes out with her friends.", "Did you read? He did talk with his wive, she doesn\u2019t listen and frankly is a manipulative piece of trash. Did you miss the part where she said she wasn\u2019t actually sorry for the last time? Why can\u2019t the wife tell her friend not to bring guys when it\u2019s clearly a girls night, as is no guys. Op clearly would be ok being told it\u2019s a girls night and that he can\u2019t come.  So op wife and her friend are the problem considering op invitation was revoked unilaterally under girls night instead and again if you read it, \u201cthey\u201d wanted to meet SIL boyfriend, not she as in the SIL wanted to.", ">but may now be realizing, with a similar situation possibly coming up, that she did not appreciate the way you responded.\n\nWhy be surprised at a reaction to a shadey situation, especially if she keeps willingly putting herself in those situations?", "it sounds like you should be more mad at SIL for ruining girls\u2019 night by inviting her BF\u2026 your wife probably had no choice in the matter. the SIL is probably in a codependent relationship and just \u201cneeded\u201d to see her guy \u2014 i know plenty of girls like that lol", "For all the talk they have about gas lighting women are the best at it", "No, plan changed, that's OK, but you still had to stay home because for you plans didn't change. She should still be apologetic. And what's worse is that she had invited you, had she just said you can't come from the start it wouldn't be as bad as inviting you, then canceling the invite and then finding out they could make an exception for another man. \n\nHow can't she see the double standards and not feel bad/acknowledge she's the one in the wrong ?", "She could apologize for how the \u201cplans changing\u201d made you feel about being uninvited and left out, instead of telling you you don\u2019t need to be upset/you\u2019re being controlling. It doesn\u2019t sound like she did this with mean intentions, but she was pretty careless about your feelings and should acknowledge that. You\u2019re NTA.", "Then her apology shouldn't be to placate you for being upset, it should be genuine.\n\nIt's one thing for plans to change, or for someone to bring a guy that ruins the plan because the 'girls night' wasn't as well communicated as expected, but to no genuinely feel sorry for excluding you from plans you could have reasonably come to is just rude.", "So do you get a boys only night out? And then let her know that the girlfriends came? This seems to be a regular thing. Are you sure nothings going on?\n\nI would be very upset. You have to know this was premeditated. There needs to be more communication And marriage counseling. She doesn\u2019t seem to care about your feelings and it\u2019s gonna do what she wants to do whether you like it or not.", "AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME O", "I think the award is so that this is highlighted because even in clear cut NTAs like this one, comments like yours are heavily downvoted and trashed to the bottom.", "Tons of people?", "No, I'm not with you on this one. Of course plans change. When she found out the plans changed it's good that she called, but why didn't she say something like \"sorry, plans changed and now some guys are here, we're going to a casino, want to come with?\"\n\nThat plus being very apologetic means something's not right here. I don't think she's fucking some random dude, but she definitely intentionally excluded her husband, then drunkenly apologized. Some flirting/emotional cheating happened FOR SURE and she wanted the attention.", "While true that isn\u2019t the problem, op wife is clearl gaslighting op, which as a wife is a crappy thing to do and to call him controlling is out of line.", "No, fuck your noise. Excluding partners is a terrible thing to do.", "Except she\u2019s planning it again. Grownups also lie and cheat.", "Sounds like your wife is using girls night as an excuse not to invite you since she knows guys may turn up. Then you're feeling disrespected because you think you should have been invited bevause it was not in fact a girls night. If she'd been honest and just said she wanted a night out by herself you wouldn't have had that expectation. \n\nSeems like your wife doesn't really feel she can say she wants to go out without you, maybe she thinks it will hurt your feelings?\n\nNext time she mentions girls night just tell her you're OK with her having a night to herself and she doesnt have to make excuses why you can't go.That way your expectations are managed and she can have a stress free evening.", "OP isn't a woman yk. He will get all the YTAs even if he isn't the asshole.", "BINGO. Girls Night means just that until we run into someone or someone in the group gets a text and makes an executive decision or the dude invites himself. I generally am just sitting there enjoying my girl time when this dude shows up. Not my choice, not my preference, but here we are. \n\nAnd if I\u2019m already annoyed and trying to power through, I don\u2019t want an earful from my husband. My husband is like \u201cso Suzie\u2019s bf just *had* to come again, huh?\u201d And then we talk shit for 1/2 an hour about Suzie\u2019s codependent relationship and her overbearing bf we all hate. That\u2019s how you do it.", "LMAO, you got seriously down voted because reddit hates the truth", " Ahh still pretty new to Reddit, but slowly learning.  Thank you for the information", "Yes, as in a hyperbolic way to generalize multiple people.\n\nI sifted through three or four comments before I replied to this one because everyone was suggesting she was trying to live like she was single, she was cheating, or she was leading into cheating.\n\nSo yeah, a fucking ton of people.", "I mean most of the top comments so far are a variation of this so", "Agreed, also the fact that she purposefully dangled the idea that \"knowing my friend I wouldn't be surprised if some guys show up\" in front of OP's face. IF she isn't doing anything disloyal, she wants him to worry about it at the very least.", "Terrible take lmao", "Lol\n110% correct", "No, down voted because it's sexist and beside the point.\nNarcissists and people with crappy personalities and no sense of shame are good at gaslighting. None of which has to do with their gender.", "No, I\u2019m saying tons of people cheat near their siblings \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I\u2019m saying tons of people cheat on their partners with family present \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Damn girl quit trying to gaslight me."]}
