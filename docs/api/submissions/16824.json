When I did this my boyfriend helped me out by loaning me some money to help pay the down payment but I have since payed him back.\n\nLast week my bfs older sister who lives in another state came to visit and stayed in the house with us. This was my first time meeting her and I thought she was very nice, but I didn't get to know her well. Two days ago my bf and I were out running errands together and his sister called him to ask when he would be back so she could borrow his car to go hangout with her friends in a town about an hour away. He told her it would be a while and she then asked if it was okay to borrow my car. My boyfriend asked me and I told him I was not comfortable with that and to tell her no. My boyfriend did tell her no, I heard the entire conversation.\n\nWell a few hours later my boyfriend and I got home and my car was gone. I was shocked and my boyfriend was confused. When we went into the house his dad informed us that he gave my bfs sister the spare key to my car that was in the lockbox because she said she needed to go somewhere. My boyfriend told him that she asked to drive my car and that we had told her no so he didn't understand why she was allowed to take it and his dad said that since my bf helped pay for the car that it therefore was partly his, which meant his sister had the right to drive it as well. I was absolutely livid and I couldn't believe that anyone would do something like this.

My bf's dad and sister were pissed about this and they accused me of trying to get them arrested. They are now demanding that I apologize to them and tell the police it was all a misunderstanding but I really don't want to because I feel that they've tried to take advantage of me.

I totally get why you called the cops. They absolutely should be raked over the coals and be held totally liable for what they did. But I can somewhat understand your boyfriend's hesitation in calling the cops. Their job is not to help you. It's to investigate, including you. I would never call 911 unless it's literally life-or-death. I don't know where you are, but in the U.S., I don't trust cops themselves further than I can throw them. Which would just get me shot. \n\nETA: When I was a teenager, my mom called the cops on me for a small amount of weed. When her dad found out, he immediately called her and ripped her a new one. Not for being upset about the weed. Simply for the fact she called the police. He was a doctor since the 50's and had worked in close contact with them for decades. He didn't trust them at all.", "NTA.

Calling the police is an overreaction.", "NTA\n\nThat said, involving the justice system in this country is not a minor thing and can have greater repercussions than one anticipates. The family was totally out of line. Having had the cops called lets them know this. While you are certainly legally in the right to prosecute, I'd encourage you to think long and hard before doing so. An apology from you is in no way warranted. Maybe offer to drop the charges if they apologize to you?", "Edit: since OP cleared that she pays rent and financially responsible for all her stuff I am going to eat my word and cut my nose here. \n\nLmao ok getting ready for down vote but whatever. Calling cops knowing that the car was actually not stolen and boyfriend\u2019s sister was going to return it is technically a crime I think because it mislead the law enforcement. No one should absolutely take someone\u2019s car without permission but calling the cop is too much, especially on family. To me it sounds like op is just cheap. She took advantage of living rent free and saving money with boyfriend\u2019s dad. It\u2019s not much to let the family to borrow the car for few hours. If this was a stranger I would totally understand. OP feels comfortable living there for free but don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing lol.  I will never understand why most redditors  are just a bunch of crybabies and think of the extreme of any given situation. Makes no sense.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.\n\nOf course she shouldn't have taken your car when you said no, and that is that. They have zero ownership over it and zero entitlement.\n\nBut is this the hill you want to die on?\nThey gave you a roof over your head, helped you buy the car, you were not using it... you haven't indicated there's any reason to believe your bfs sister would damage your car. If you see yourself being with this guy forever, you have to consider what battles you have with his family too. \n\nCalling the police was a little extreme (assuming there has been no other issues between you). You knew who had the car and it would be returned.", "Meh, calling the police was excessive - especially since BF's dad probably got out together by the sister. You're well within your right to be mad as hell, but soft YTA for going right to the cops.", "YTA. Calling the police was wayyyyyy too much, IMHO.

I\u2019m anti woke, but If she was African American, she legit could have been killed.  She should have to pay you back in some way though that severely penalized her. Like a daily car rental rate.

I'd wager the only reason she hasn't been asked to already is they think she'd be less likely to drop the matter with the police. And even if she does, they might still ask her to leave.\n\nAnd OP,  be aware that, in the area I'm in, you could be evicted with police enforcement immediately because your tenancy counts as boarding, assuming you share a kitchen with the owners. So don't assume you'll have 30 days to figure something out, look in to the eviction rules for where you're living and plan accordingly.\n\nAnd personally, if there's no damage to the vehicle, I'd probably drop the current issue. I'd add a \"now you know how I react to someone taking my car without my permission\" so that they don't think that means they can start doing it. But overall, they have leverage over your living situation while your biggest worry didn't end up hurting you. That changes if a) there is damage to deal with, or b) you're fine with finding alternate living arrangements, even immediately.\n\nEither way NTA.

It's not worth the savings to have your property stolen and boundaries violated.

How long was OP supposed to wait, all night?", "I\u2019m lowkey side eyeing what OP says in a comment that they\u2019re not willing to move out because they get to save money.

She knew who had it and why. She had contact with the person who had it.\n\nI am IN NO WAY condoning the fact that the sister felt entitled to take the car without her consent, nor the dad for giving up OP\u2019s keys without her consent. That was unbelievably shitty, and warrants OP and her bf moving out and probably going low or no contact with the family. But treating the situation like the car was stolen by a stranger off the street, or someone broke into the house and stole her keys, is an overreaction. Police involvement is a completely nuclear option, and OP went straight for it. Downvote me all you want.\n\nETA: the reason I\u2019m arguing ESH is because I don\u2019t believe that OP truly thought her car was gone forever (I.e., really and truly \u2018stolen\u2019 by the sister). My impression is she was pissed and wanted to get back at the sister for taking the car after being told no.

OP said sister seems nice, and there's no indication bf relationship with sister is strained. So OP is just making things awkward for bf and her future self in that family. \n\nI would say wait more than 2 hours, yes. I repeat, OP should warn them of intention to ring police first.  When you report a missing person, they ask you if it's been 24 hours. 2 hours in not that long when you know who has your car and that it is intended to be returned.  I already said it was wrong of Dad and sis.\n\nRespectfully, agree to disagree with you all on this one. ESH is my final verdict (based on what I think I've read/been provided).", "The post indicates the car had been missing for a total of approximately FIVE hours. About 3 hours before the father called and told her to come home. She promised to come back soon. \nThen another 2 hours passed and nothing. The sister had plenty of time to bring it back before the police were called."]}
