This was my first time meeting her and I thought she was very nice, but I didn't get to know her well. Two days ago my bf and I were out running errands together and his sister called him to ask when he would be back so she could borrow his car to go hangout with her friends in a town about an hour away. He told her it would be a while and she then asked if it was okay to borrow my car. My boyfriend asked me and I told him I was not comfortable with that and to tell her no. My boyfriend did tell her no, I heard the entire conversation.\n\nWell a few hours later my boyfriend and I got home and my car was gone. I was shocked and my boyfriend was confused. When we went into the house his dad informed us that he gave my bfs sister the spare key to my car that was in the lockbox because she said she needed to go somewhere. My boyfriend told him that she asked to drive my car and that we had told her no so he didn't understand why she was allowed to take it and his dad said that since my bf helped pay for the car that it therefore was partly his, which meant his sister had the right to drive it as well. I was absolutely livid and I couldn't believe that anyone would do something like this.

I totally get why you called the cops. They absolutely should be raked over the coals and be held totally liable for what they did. But I can somewhat understand your boyfriend's hesitation in calling the cops. Their job is not to help you. It's to investigate, including you. I would never call 911 unless it's literally life-or-death. I don't know where you are, but in the U.S., I don't trust cops themselves further than I can throw them. Which would just get me shot. \n\nETA: When I was a teenager, my mom called the cops on me for a small amount of weed. When her dad found out, he immediately called her and ripped her a new one. Not for being upset about the weed. Simply for the fact she called the police. He was a doctor since the 50's and had worked in close contact with them for decades.

Calling the police is an overreaction.", "NTA\n\nThat said, involving the justice system in this country is not a minor thing and can have greater repercussions than one anticipates. The family was totally out of line. Having had the cops called lets them know this. While you are certainly legally in the right to prosecute, I'd encourage you to think long and hard before doing so. An apology from you is in no way warranted. Maybe offer to drop the charges if they apologize to you?", "Edit: since OP cleared that she pays rent and financially responsible for all her stuff I am going to eat my word and cut my nose here. \n\nLmao ok getting ready for down vote but whatever. Calling cops knowing that the car was actually not stolen and boyfriend\u2019s sister was going to return it is technically a crime I think because it mislead the law enforcement. No one should absolutely take someone\u2019s car without permission but calling the cop is too much, especially on family. To me it sounds like op is just cheap. She took advantage of living rent free and saving money with boyfriend\u2019s dad. It\u2019s not much to let the family to borrow the car for few hours. If this was a stranger I would totally understand. OP feels comfortable living there for free but don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing lol.  I will never understand why most redditors  are just a bunch of crybabies and think of the extreme of any given situation. Makes no sense.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.\n\nOf course she shouldn't have taken your car when you said no, and that is that. They have zero ownership over it and zero entitlement.\n\nBut is this the hill you want to die on?\nThey gave you a roof over your head, helped you buy the car, you were not using it... you haven't indicated there's any reason to believe your bfs sister would damage your car. If you see yourself being with this guy forever, you have to consider what battles you have with his family too. \n\nCalling the police was a little extreme (assuming there has been no other issues between you).

You're well within your right to be mad as hell, but soft YTA for going right to the cops.", "YTA. Calling the police was wayyyyyy too much, IMHO.

I\u2019m anti woke, but If she was African American, she legit could have been killed.  She should have to pay you back in some way though that severely penalized her. Like a daily car rental rate.

They said they would send someone and by the time the police officer arrived to our home his sister had been back for about 30 or so minutes. My car was not damaged and everything on it was fine, so I just explained  to the officer the situation and he asked if I wanted to press charges and I said no. The sole reason I wanted to file a police report was in case something on my car was damaged, and since it wasn't, I believed it wasn't necessary to take it any further. The police officer talked to his sister and left. She won't be getting arrested, charged, etc. However, his dad and sister are still insisting I tried to have them arrested, which is why they're demanding an apology.\n\nI have also seen a lot of comments asking me why I didn't want her to use my car, and the simple answer is because I don't know her! We had only just met and I simply did not feel comfortable giving my car to someone I don't know well. People are calling me selfish for that and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but honestly I disagree. \n\nFurther, I have both my keys now! I will make sure no one besides either my bf or I ever are able to get them again. Consider that lesson learned. Also for everyone advising me to move out, my bf and I have discussed it and we are currently searching for an apartment we can move into within the next few weeks. My bf asked his dad would he be kicking us out and his dad told him\nhe wouldn't, but we both aren't really willing to take his word on this. \n\nI really appreciate everyone who offered kind words and advice.

I understand that this chick is someone you just met.. but she is your bf\u2019s sister. Did you ask him if she\u2019s a terrible, unreliable, untrustworthy driver? Is she known to crash her cars? She\u2019s obviously someone who takes advantage of what\u2019s in front of her (ie your car). But was it really worth calling the cops on her? I think that was a bit much tbh. \n\nBitching her out at home and never trusting her again is what I would have done. Along with not keeping a spare key in the home.

Then you think it\u2019s ok to have his own son threaten him? Wow just wow. I am pretty speechless at how awful this behavior is.

Well some dude way past his prime crashes his motorcycle into the right side of it while she\u2019s on her way back and I have to immediately get in her car to go assess the damage and help with the police report. I call my insurance to let them know what happened and say I wasn\u2019t the one driving my vehicle. I had my truck for maybe two months at the time and this was the first time my gf had ever driven it. Other guy\u2019s insurance pays for everything and even let me pick out the body shop I wanted to take my truck to. \n\nMy insurance raised my rate by $350/month and immediately added my gf to my plan. I completely trusted her driving my truck from day one, but never let her drive it again unless absolutely necessary because of that bullshit. I fought them and got my original rate back, but the hassle of going through that screwed me on thinking other people can drive my vehicle.

I pay rent as well as contribute to bills and household groceries. Further, my boyfriend never threatened anyone nor did I ask him to so I have no clue where you got that from?

Someone else using your car when you\u2019re the only one on the registration and insurance is a huge liability issue. Also, like OP said they literally went behind OP\u2019s back and used it without permission rather than being upfront and telling OP they needed to add the sister to the insurance and stuff in order to continue staying with them.", "I really don't think they would pay if it gets damaged because they already justified it's partly the bf's car and have the right to use it.", "That was poor reading comprehension on my part, sorry.

The scenario is a little different than a regular car theft scenario.", "In my opinion, involving the police brings more danger to a situation.

The repercussions to her would have been the same.", "They wouldn't exactly have a choice. If there's an accident they have to exchange insurance info at the scene. The driver's insurance will pick up the tab  and raise their rates.", "We disagree on the appropriateness of calling the cops here, and IMO it's clear from OP's responses that the relationship ending possibilities were discussed with her boyfriend.", ">I don't think the specifics of how we classify the crime legally makes her less of a victim.\n\nNo but her *actually* being less of a victim makes her less of a victim.  \n\nShe couldn\u2019t use her car for three hours.  That sucks.  I hate when that happens.\n\nBut it happens all the time.  Having your car stolen is much worse.\n\n> She still had her vehicle stolen (in general usage at least, if not legally) \n\nYou are saying that there is a colloquial usage equating one action with another, both of those actions are equivalent?  You never wanted to \u201cmurder\u201d a friend for being late?  You never got \u201craped\u201d on a phone bill?\n\nHer car was *not* stolen!  She was not victimized the way someone whose car was stolen was.\n\n> could have been liable for damage to it\n\nUh, what?\n\nThe OP said the same thing, as if damage done to a car by a car thief were somehow free. \n\nNo, reporting a car as stolen does not give you any shield from liability.  The only exception I can think of is if the driver is intoxicated and you knowingly lend them your car, there might be derivative civil liability for any damage they do.", ">No but her actually being less of a victim makes her less of a victim.\n\nI still just don't agree with this. The repercussions to her are the same as if the car was stolen for 3 hours as well.\n\n>Her car was not stolen!\n\nWe are arguing semantics. If someone takes something that is mine without permission, they have stolen it. It doesn't matter what you want to call that legally, it is a kind of stealing and is punished the same way in court, same charges can be applied.\n\n>No, reporting a car as stolen does not give you any shield from liability.\n\nYes it does. Your insurance company won't honor any sort of auto theft claim to cover damages unless a police report has been filed. Damage coverable by insurance relies on you having filed with police."]}
