My bf and I were in a long distance relationship for a few years and I moved across the country to be with him after I finished graduate school. Due to such a large distance I opted to sell my car and buy a new one after moving. When I did this my boyfriend helped me out by loaning me some money to help pay the down payment but I have since payed him back.\n\nLast week my bfs older sister who lives in another state came to visit and stayed in the house with us. This was my first time meeting her and I thought she was very nice, but I didn't get to know her well. Two days ago my bf and I were out running errands together and his sister called him to ask when he would be back so she could borrow his car to go hangout with her friends in a town about an hour away. He told her it would be a while and she then asked if it was okay to borrow my car. My boyfriend asked me and I told him I was not comfortable with that and to tell her no. My boyfriend did tell her no, I heard the entire conversation.\n\nWell a few hours later my boyfriend and I got home and my car was gone. I was shocked and my boyfriend was confused. When we went into the house his dad informed us that he gave my bfs sister the spare key to my car that was in the lockbox because she said she needed to go somewhere. My boyfriend told him that she asked to drive my car and that we had told her no so he didn't understand why she was allowed to take it and his dad said that since my bf helped pay for the car that it therefore was partly his, which meant his sister had the right to drive it as well. I was absolutely livid and I couldn't believe that anyone would do something like this. My name is the only one on the title, insurance, etc. as I am the SOLE owner.\n\nMy bf told his dad to call her and tell her to bring my car back immediately and she said she would \"be home soon.\" Well after two hours I called the police and reported my car stolen because I was worried that if it got damaged or something then I would be forced to pay the repairs even though it wasn't my fault. My bf's dad and sister were pissed about this and they accused me of trying to get them arrested. They are now demanding that I apologize to them and tell the police it was all a misunderstanding but I really don't want to because I feel that they've tried to take advantage of me. My boyfriend agrees with me but he even said he thinks calling the police to report the car stolen may have been too far.

I totally get why you called the cops. They absolutely should be raked over the coals and be held totally liable for what they did. But I can somewhat understand your boyfriend's hesitation in calling the cops. Their job is not to help you. It's to investigate, including you. I would never call 911 unless it's literally life-or-death. I don't know where you are, but in the U.S., I don't trust cops themselves further than I can throw them. Which would just get me shot. \n\nETA: When I was a teenager, my mom called the cops on me for a small amount of weed. When her dad found out, he immediately called her and ripped her a new one. Not for being upset about the weed. Simply for the fact she called the police. He was a doctor since the 50's and had worked in close contact with them for decades.

Calling the police is an overreaction.", "NTA\n\nThat said, involving the justice system in this country is not a minor thing and can have greater repercussions than one anticipates. The family was totally out of line. Having had the cops called lets them know this. While you are certainly legally in the right to prosecute, I'd encourage you to think long and hard before doing so. An apology from you is in no way warranted. Maybe offer to drop the charges if they apologize to you?", "Lmao ok getting ready for down vote but whatever. Calling cops knowing that the car was actually not stolen and boyfriend\u2019s sister was going to return it is technically a crime I think because it mislead the law enforcement. No one should absolutely take someone\u2019s car without permission but calling the cop is too much, especially on family. To me it sounds like op is just cheap. She took advantage of living rent free and saving money with boyfriend\u2019s dad. It\u2019s not much to let the family to borrow the car for few hours. If this was a stranger I would totally understand. OP feels comfortable living there for free but don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing lol.  I will never understand why most redditors  are just a bunch of crybabies and think of the extreme of any given situation. Makes no sense.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.\n\nOf course she shouldn't have taken your car when you said no, and that is that. They have zero ownership over it and zero entitlement.\n\nBut is this the hill you want to die on?\nThey gave you a roof over your head, helped you buy the car, you were not using it... you haven't indicated there's any reason to believe your bfs sister would damage your car.

You knew who had the car and it would be returned.", "Meh, calling the police was excessive - especially since BF's dad probably got out together by the sister. You're well within your right to be mad as hell, but soft YTA for going right to the cops.", "YTA. Calling the police was wayyyyyy too much, IMHO. And if I were the father, I'd tell you to get the F out of my house, like, yesterday.", "YTA, never call the police. I\u2019m anti woke, but If she was African American, she legit could have been killed.  She should have to pay you back in some way though that severely penalized her. Like a daily car rental rate.

Not that it matters, just feels odd.\n\nBack to the subject, if she didn't want the cops called for grand theft auto, she shouldn't have stolen the car. Classic game of FAFO.", "It is amazing to me that the OP's boyfriend's family has shown significant kindness by allowing the OP to move it, and his response is calling the cops when the sister borrowed a car without permission.", "I gotchu", "Exactly! Only thing OP did wrong was not reporting it stolen immediately.", "The money you save isn't worth the drama. Move", "Move....", "Move.", "\u201cYou save money living with parents because you pay with your mental health\u201d", "That's exactly what the above comment is saying. \n\nShe reported it stolen, hence she's safe from being held liable for possible damages caused while SIL was driving without OP's permission.", "My question was just to understand the situation there. Now had you not given the money back with no intention of even returning, then 1/4th of the car would morally belong to your bf. The fact that you did, absolves his right over it. But regardless of all that, neither his father nor his sister has any rights on it.", "Hey, grad school: It's PAID, not payed.", "It was relevant for me to get the whole story. Doesn't change my judgement though.", "I must have missed out on that, my bad.", "It's 1.25 am here. Excuse my inability to properly read the whole post.\ud83d\ude48", "Not so. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on recording police. A couple of District Court of Appeals have. Know your rights. And where they end.", "You were very gracious in response to all the wild assumptions in that comment.", "Sure that's one way to look at it. But OP hasn't given any indication to believe:\n1. the sister would damage it\n2. She/dad wouldn't pay for damages\n\nFair enough the point re: liability and even third party etc. Would push premiums up so I get that. \n\nBut OP waited TWO hours before calling the police. She could have said, \"if its not returned safely by xx then I will call the police.\"\n\nI also believe people have to be responsible with police resources and as somebody pointed out - not be used for petty squabbles - in shortish timeframe.\n\nAnd, proportionality. That is pretty heavy reaction for the crime (in terms of time waited).\n\nFinally, her own bf thought it was extreme even though he supports her and probably puts him in a really awkward position. \n\nSister and Dad were still colossal idiots but yeah that was extreme.", "Was beginning to think I was in a parallel universe, scrolling here!  \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "Personally, I would have given the dad an ultimatum to get the car back (since he handed out the keys).  I mean, yeah, the sister probably lied to dad and said she talked to you and it's okay.  Ok - then that's on him to handle with the bratty sister when the car comes back.\n\nYou could even dangle the \"or imma call the cops\", with the qualifier of \"if it's not back before x time\" or \"if its damaged or abused\" just to put a finer point on it.\n\nGoing right to the cops pretty much ensures that from now to whenever you decide to bolt this relationship you're always going to be \"that girl my brother dated that called the cops on me\".  \n\nI'm wound a little tight when it comes to this level of disrespect, so I'd probably just get as far away from dad and sis (and probably BF, depending on what side he takes) as possible.", "Because I was taking the woke stance, I try not to use it a crutch.  Pay the teachers, save the whales.  People always want to find the angle that makes them the victim when being the bigger person is exponentially more satisfying.  I\u2019d be more mad the person who called the cops than borrowed my car without permission.  I\u2019d be pretty pissed too though if someone took my car after I said no.", "You\u2019re much appreciated!", "Could you explain moral ownership from a legal standpoint? Because as far as I know morality has nothing to do with ownership. Also, morality is a subjective concept while ownership is objective.", "> then 1/4th of the car would morally belong to your bf.   \n   \nBF loaned an amount equal to 25% of the **downpayment** not 25% of the value of the car. Morally and legally he would be entitled to no more than $1,000 (plus any agreed to interest) at that point, but his loan was not secured against the car.", "For me it's the disrespect from the Dad and sister that make this an easy NTA. If it had been an emergency, I'd have more sympathy for the sister. It wasn't an emergency though, she just wanted to do stuff because she was bored. Then after being told EXPLICITLY that she wasn't allowed to take OP's car, sister and her dad both decide that OP has no right to decide what to do with their own property, and that clearly sister's wants trump OP's ownership of the car. Then the dad figures that his authority as elder means he can tell OP to get over it. \n\nSister committed grand theft auto with dad as an accomplice. No grey area here, sister and dad were 100% in the wrong.", "My only point was, that if she HADNT repaid him, part of the money paid into the car would be his. And here I am talking about her intention of not paying back as well. That time, it doesn't remain a loan from him, rather he kind of an investor in the car as well, since he did not get his shares back. \nBut none of that stands true here, since she had the intent to pay, and also, did pay back. Since I am talking about intent here, morality is something I brought in.\nNot once did I speak about any legal aspect.", "Are you seriously nitpicking on my comment? I agree that the down-payment was an oversight from me, but what I wanted to convey in the end wasn't wrong.", "No, it was wrong. They don\u2019t own a 1/4th of the car if they paid for a 1/4th of the down payment.", "25% of a car and $1k are pretty different, and at no point did the BF have *any* right to the car (just like the dad and sister).", "I accepted I was wrong in the other comment.", "You win, I made a blunder there. Happy?"]}
