He told us he has a \"kink\" for extreme body odor, and so they haven't taken a shower (Their words not mine) in over 3 YEARS.

Most of our friends agree that it is really gross, and I eventually decided that he has to either shower, or im just not taking part.

I can't imagine being around it, especially in enclosed spaces.  Yuck!", "NTA. If it\u2019s not a big deal then he should be able to shower\u2026", "NTA.\n\nTell it to him straight. \n\nMost homeless people use every opportunity to clean themselves and their clothes. This sounds like a mental health problem covered as a kink", "NTA\n\nA kink is something that turns a person on. It can be something a lot of people get turned on by, or something very few. But as it is a sexual behaviour/focus, it is not necessarily something that is appropriate for everywhere and everyone. \n\nIf a guy likes to whip other people, it is not okay for him to go out in public and whip people against their wishes. This is what Mike is doing. His fetish for body odour is fine, but when he is around you and your friends, he forcing it on you against your wishes. It is fine, appropriate, and acceptable to explain that while you respect his fetish, it is making you feel uncomfortable and therefore you choose not to be around him. \n\nHe may say you are kink shaming, but you have a right to comfort and shit smell free living.", "He's \"a great person\"? He hasn't cleaned himself in three years, but he's a great person?\n\nThis lends a new meaning to the word \"great.\"", "NTA. Him finding sexual gratification in being unhygienic does not mean you have to put up with it. I can\u2019t help but wonder if his kink is only for the smell itself or also for subjecting others to it and seeing their reactions. If so he\u2019s forcing you to participate in his kink without consent which would be deeply disrespectful and a form of violation.", "NTA. I don't care what his kink is, forcing you to be a part of it is not ok. It is perfectly reasonable for you to expect him to conform to hygiene standards", "NTA Sorry,  but that has to be extremely unsanitary not only for him,  but for you as well. I don't even like going to the store smelling stinky people, let alone hang out with them.  You should just be straightforward and let them know why they aren't included. You can still be a fun person to hang out with,  doesn't mean I want to if you smell that bad.  No thank you.", "NTA - Why does he get a say in what stinks and what doesn't stinky people are dirty people he's a walking science experiment they'll probably discover new strains of bacteria on him ewwww", "NTA, and how the heck does he ever get seated in a public place of any kind, especially one that serves food and beverages. I don't think that intervention groups are usually a good idea, but this situation definitely calls for it. That, or he can hang out with friends who have similar interests.", "NTA, how the fuck does he even function in society? I can't imagine anyone would want to employ him. \n\nAlso even if it is a kink, that's not a reason to subject everyone around him to it. It's all about consent and I doubt anyone around him is consenting to have their nasal passages assaulted in such a vile way.", "NTA That's fucking vile", "Invite him to go swimming, long walks in the rain, a water balloon fight, wash multiple cars, ... oh yeah NTA", "EW. NO.\n\nNTA. And I don't know how anyone stands for it.\n\nKINKS NEED TO HAVE CONSENT.", "NTA and it\u2019s not even just about smell, it\u2019s about hygiene. I wouldn\u2019t even want to be around someone like that just from the fact that you could potentially get sick because he\u2019s not washing fecal matter off of him (ew ew ew). You honestly would be doing him a favor by standing your ground on this one.", "He\u2019s watched too much Charlie Brown where Pigpen is always accepted \ud83e\udd2d", "NTA - tell him you have a kink for deodorant and shampoo.", "NTA.\n\nIf someone's kink is outwardly obvious to everyone to the point of being disruptive, that's not just a kink anymore, they're being an AH. He can be unwashed for a few days before his fun times if that's what he's into, but he shouldn't expect anyone else to put up with it.", "When I worked retail we had a customer who came in once a month to bulk buy and she smelt awful like eye watering awful and my manager told me unless she's going near open food (produce) we couldn't ask her to leave because of how she could potentially portray the event. Especially if we asked her to leave due to smell and she decided to shower then complain to management, so it might be too many don't wanna risk backlash.", "Exactly. This is roughly the same as if he were masturbating in front of them.", "Mike needs to invent a time machine and go back to 1437. Then, no one will care that he doesn't bathe.\n\nNTA", "NTA-  people shouldn't go out and about smelling like hell. I don't go out much, I prefer not to leave the house in general, I know I can get smelly after a couple days. But if I'm going out in public, or if I'm having friends over, I'm gonna bathe, that's common decency.", "NTA, it sounds like you have told him the reason he is not invited and he can feel how he feels,but you can feel how you feel. \n\nHe is free to make extreme body odor kink plans and you are free to be excluded.", "NTA and honestly he\u2019s aware that he\u2019s involving others in this \u201ckink\u201d of his. He\u2019s aware the stink bothers people. Apparently he likes that. \n\nThat\u2019s not okay and it\u2019s not consensual. Cut him off. \n\n\u201cMike, as your friend I need you to take care of yourself. You\u2019re aware your body odor impacts those around you. As a friend- I can\u2019t support this choice not to bathe, and so until you practice regular hygiene we won\u2019t be able to spend time together\u201d", "NTA. \u201cgod\u201d gave us a sense of smell for a reason. Have you ever flown international? If so then you\u2019re aware of just how awful that part of the airport smells. It\u2019s like a dead body covered with a bottle of high end perfume. That alone makes me travel less.", "YTA\nMaybe they can't smell\nYou should be tolerant of their smells. Maybe turn it into something kinky", "NTA\n\nThat is disgusting. Hope Mike enjoys being alone.", "Nta. Smelling yucky isn't a small issue and his kink isn't going to get him laid. Disgusting", "I'm really curious if Mike has a job, smelling so bad and not showering allegedly for three years??\n\nIf this is his kink, he's forcing others to participate without consent. That's a no-go. \n\nNTA. I'd just leave the whole friend circle if I were you.", "His smell is not something small. \n\nSorry but that would be a friendship ender to me too. I'm amazed he isn't asked to leave bars/restaurants if he smells that bad. NTA", "WOW.  I wonder if his ass and crotch are crusty and painful. You know kind of diaper rash?  \ud83e\udd2e", "I'm sorry, but this post made me laugh so hard, and I'm having a crappy day, so THANK YOU.", "NTA - honesty is the best policy here. Mike is free to be disgusting and you're free not to hang out with him. You can make plans separate with the other friends in your group and they can decide how they want to proceed.", "Info \n\nDoes Mike date or anything ?  \n\nCos Damn that's just nasty.  \n\nIt would take someone with anosmia maybe to be intimate with him.      \n\nStill leaves the hygiene issue.", "Simple simple answer for this. No you're not the asshole. He's allowed his choices, as are you. And if I'm out with people, I'm not going to lie.... I would be embarrassed to be with someone like that and wouldn't be able to enjoy my time. Maybe that sounds mean, but it's honest. I'd be so distracted by the body odor that I couldn't enjoy my night, so why would I continue to put myself through that? \n\nI'd try to salvage what I could of the friendship. Even if it just meant checking in occasionally to see how life was going. But compatibility exists in all forms of relationships, and if it's not there... it's not there.", "Work from home?\n\nOmg I literally just got hit with first an imaginary image of his desk chair\u2026.then couch\u2026..and finally his bed/sheets. \n\n\n\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\n\nETA: HOW IS HE NOT FUCKING RAW?! Between his cheeks, his thighs/genitalia area etc. those places breed so much bacteria that the skin is likely so infected that it\u2019s rotting or needs removed. It\u2019s almost like a diaper rash type thing that then will keep festering. \n\nIm gonna lose 5 pounds from all this virtual vomiting im doing \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "> He's allowed his kink\n\nNo.  No he isn't.  Kinks must be consensual for everyone involved.  He's imposing his kink non-consensually on others.  There's no difference between this and someone with a kink for exhibitionism having public sex in a park where anyone can see.  It's not OK to involve me in your kink without checking with me that I consent.", "no one is allowed to inflict their kink on non consenting individuals.\n\nif he's standing his ground in this, then i don't see any appealing reason to be this persons friend.", "NTA. I don't care what his kink is, forcing you to be a part of it is not ok.", "Yep. You sit where he\u2019s sat, and you\u2019ve got a staph infection"]}
