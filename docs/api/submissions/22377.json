There are 6 of us total, and I seriously love every one of them to death, but one of my friends in particular refuses to shower. We'll call him Mike. Mike is a great person and I love hanging out with them, but because they refuse to shower, and I don't really know how to put this lightly, but they smell like shit. Actual shit and piss. He told us he has a \"kink\" for extreme body odor, and so they haven't taken a shower (Their words not mine) in over 3 YEARS. Not even a single one, and even though I love to hang out with him, it is so disgusting to be around them. Most of our friends agree that it is really gross, and I eventually decided that he has to either shower, or im just not taking part. He thinks I am being a dick to let something as small as his smell get in the way of our friendship, but I'm standing my ground on it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689499889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1511vbd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_one_of_my_friends/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
