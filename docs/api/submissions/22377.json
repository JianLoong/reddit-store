But as it is a sexual behaviour/focus, it is not necessarily something that is appropriate for everywhere and everyone. \n\nIf a guy likes to whip other people, it is not okay for him to go out in public and whip people against their wishes. This is what Mike is doing. His fetish for body odour is fine, but when he is around you and your friends, he forcing it on you against your wishes. It is fine, appropriate, and acceptable to explain that while you respect his fetish, it is making you feel uncomfortable and therefore you choose not to be around him. \n\nHe may say you are kink shaming, but you have a right to comfort and shit smell free living.", "He's \"a great person\"?

Him finding sexual gratification in being unhygienic does not mean you have to put up with it.

I don't care what his kink is, forcing you to be a part of it is not ok. It is perfectly reasonable for you to expect him to conform to hygiene standards", "NTA Sorry,  but that has to be extremely unsanitary not only for him,  but for you as well. I don't even like going to the store smelling stinky people, let alone hang out with them.  You should just be straightforward and let them know why they aren't included. You can still be a fun person to hang out with,  doesn't mean I want to if you smell that bad.

I can't imagine anyone would want to employ him. \n\nAlso even if it is a kink, that's not a reason to subject everyone around him to it.

No you're not the asshole. He's allowed his choices, as are you. And if I'm out with people, I'm not going to lie.... I would be embarrassed to be with someone like that and wouldn't be able to enjoy my time. Maybe that sounds mean, but it's honest. I'd be so distracted by the body odor that I couldn't enjoy my night, so why would I continue to put myself through that? \n\nI'd try to salvage what I could of the friendship.
