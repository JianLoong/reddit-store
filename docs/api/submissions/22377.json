There are 6 of us total, and I seriously love every one of them to death, but one of my friends in particular refuses to shower. We'll call him Mike. Mike is a great person and I love hanging out with them, but because they refuse to shower, and I don't really know how to put this lightly, but they smell like shit. Actual shit and piss. He told us he has a \"kink\" for extreme body odor, and so they haven't taken a shower (Their words not mine) in over 3 YEARS. Not even a single one, and even though I love to hang out with him, it is so disgusting to be around them. Most of our friends agree that it is really gross, and I eventually decided that he has to either shower, or im just not taking part. He thinks I am being a dick to let something as small as his smell get in the way of our friendship, but I'm standing my ground on it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689499889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1511vbd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_one_of_my_friends/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no need to beat around the bush.  Tell him his odour makes you want to vomit like it would any normal person in society.  And no, he cannot come out with you.

I can't imagine being around it, especially in enclosed spaces.  Yuck!", "NTA. If it\u2019s not a big deal then he should be able to shower\u2026", "NTA.\n\nTell it to him straight. \n\nMost homeless people use every opportunity to clean themselves and their clothes. This sounds like a mental health problem covered as a kink", "NTA\n\nA kink is something that turns a person on. It can be something a lot of people get turned on by, or something very few. But as it is a sexual behaviour/focus, it is not necessarily something that is appropriate for everywhere and everyone. \n\nIf a guy likes to whip other people, it is not okay for him to go out in public and whip people against their wishes. This is what Mike is doing. His fetish for body odour is fine, but when he is around you and your friends, he forcing it on you against your wishes. It is fine, appropriate, and acceptable to explain that while you respect his fetish, it is making you feel uncomfortable and therefore you choose not to be around him. \n\nHe may say you are kink shaming, but you have a right to comfort and shit smell free living.", "He's \"a great person\"? He hasn't cleaned himself in three years, but he's a great person?\n\nThis lends a new meaning to the word \"great.\"", "NTA. Him finding sexual gratification in being unhygienic does not mean you have to put up with it. I can\u2019t help but wonder if his kink is only for the smell itself or also for subjecting others to it and seeing their reactions. If so he\u2019s forcing you to participate in his kink without consent which would be deeply disrespectful and a form of violation.", "NTA. I don't care what his kink is, forcing you to be a part of it is not ok. It is perfectly reasonable for you to expect him to conform to hygiene standards", "NTA Sorry,  but that has to be extremely unsanitary not only for him,  but for you as well. I don't even like going to the store smelling stinky people, let alone hang out with them.  You should just be straightforward and let them know why they aren't included. You can still be a fun person to hang out with,  doesn't mean I want to if you smell that bad.  No thank you.", "NTA - Why does he get a say in what stinks and what doesn't stinky people are dirty people he's a walking science experiment they'll probably discover new strains of bacteria on him ewwww", "NTA, and how the heck does he ever get seated in a public place of any kind, especially one that serves food and beverages. I don't think that intervention groups are usually a good idea, but this situation definitely calls for it. That, or he can hang out with friends who have similar interests.", "NTA, how the fuck does he even function in society? I can't imagine anyone would want to employ him. \n\nAlso even if it is a kink, that's not a reason to subject everyone around him to it. It's all about consent and I doubt anyone around him is consenting to have their nasal passages assaulted in such a vile way.", "NTA That's fucking vile", "Invite him to go swimming, long walks in the rain, a water balloon fight, wash multiple cars, ... oh yeah NTA"]}
