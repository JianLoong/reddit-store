But as it is a sexual behaviour/focus, it is not necessarily something that is appropriate for everywhere and everyone. \n\nIf a guy likes to whip other people, it is not okay for him to go out in public and whip people against their wishes. This is what Mike is doing. His fetish for body odour is fine, but when he is around you and your friends, he forcing it on you against your wishes.

I would be embarrassed to be with someone like that and wouldn't be able to enjoy my time. Maybe that sounds mean, but it's honest. I'd be so distracted by the body odor that I couldn't enjoy my night, so why would I continue to put myself through that? \n\nI'd try to salvage what I could of the friendship.
