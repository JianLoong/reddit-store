(guess we know where the kid gets it from\u2026) he does not get to \u201cmoan\u201d at the person who deals with this shit the other 4 nights a week, and maybe if dad spent a little less time detailing every move the kid makes and a little more time listening to the kid and talking to him it would go just a tad smoother. or maybe not! still his turn, and you still don\u2019t need to hear it. you\u2019re at work.", "NTA. \n\nI would put him on mute though.

Every diaper blowout, every super-long line at the store, every inconvenience at work.  \n\n\nHe's the parent in charge. His job is to do the parenting. Doing this makes it seem like you are responsible even for the times you're not there.

Maybe next time do the same to him see if he likes having you constantly text him. He needs to learn how to work through the tantrums and not solely rely on you. He is also your child's parent.", "NTA. It sounds like he's trying to make you feel bad about leaving him to care for his own child.", "Why the frick is he texting you instead of, you know, trying to calm his toddler down?!!!  NTA and tell him it would go better if he actually paid attention to the kid.  Okay, maybe a bit harsh, but you are right in the fact you CANNOT do anything to help. You know it isn't going well. So him bitching isn't helping anyone besides him.", "NTA. Hes whining. Tots tossing tantrums is normal. Time for hubby to learn how to be a  parent.", "NTA\n\nhowever I would suggest having a calm discussion with him explaining how it makes you feel but at the same time also listen to him and his grievances. We aren't all equal in life, equality doesn't work and in a relationship it's important to see things in a form of equity than equality. \n\nI hope you can work it out and both be in a position where you feel better and can hopefully grow from this speed bump.", "NTA. He's an adult AND a parent, He should WANT to be seen as one, which includes caring for his own child without a constant audience for his moaning, especially because YOU'RE AT WORK. It's probably not the worst idea to Talk to him about the Fable of the Boy who cried Wolf, as in, if he Texts you at Work constantly to Tell you Things you don't want to hear that he should be, and IS, handling without you, then you may turn off your Phone or deliberately Not Look at it, and then miss it If you are needed for an ACTUAL emergency...", "You're not a diary.\n\nThat's a terrible way to communicate and has nothing to do with partnership, parenting, teams work ECT.\n\nIt's just selfish.\n\nIt also keeps you responsible.\n\nLike you've been able to say \"we've been busy so toddler is out of sorts and more cranky\"\n\nHe can't build that awareness and adjust his parenting to recognise that and adjust his approach if he is just going to sit there texting you while toddler is upset.\n\nAlso how can he parent effectively if he is just on his phone whining about having to parent a cranky kid?", "NTA. He's mentally draining you. Show him this post.", "Info - i feel like the hyperbole doesnt work here. How many texts are we talking?", "That's not moaning, that's a whole fucking guilt trip.\n\nNext time toddler throws a tantrum, text him minute-to-minute updates (even if he's in the house) to see how he likes it.", "NTA. He is assuming a babysitter mentality and needs to grow up. It also infiltrates your space. When my partner puts our kid to bed, I'll get one update after she's in bed tied in with a how are you.", "NAH.\n\nHe could be mirroring how you talk to him about the kid, or he could be looking for some additional emotional support.

You're at work, and if you don't feel comfortable simply muting/ignoring notifications then it's fine to have asked him to throttle back with the play-by-play texting.\n\nThe details in your post make it pretty clear that your toddler currently has a \"favorite\" parent. And if you mean your child is still relying on you for comfort nursing, then that's another legit reason why your husband is frustrated at having fewer tools in his own childcare toolbox.\n\nOf course your husband has to manage on his own regardless, but you could have a little more sympathy about him having a rough night---instead, you've rushed here to have everyone dogpile on him and say what an asshole you married.", "I know it\u2019s hard but both need to quit babying him if he throws a tantrum ignore it you give him attention will make it worse now if he\u2019s hurt or something don\u2019t but a little crying won\u2019t kill him", "Nta.
