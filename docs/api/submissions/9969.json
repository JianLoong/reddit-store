She and I used to be really close, but as we\u2019ve grown into adulthood we\u2019ve drifted pretty far apart. We have very different views on life and she has grown into a very judgmental, hard to be around person.   \n\nEveryone who knows my sister knows that her life long dream is to be married and have a family. She talks about it constantly. About 5 years ago, she had a long term boyfriend and was so eager to marry him she decided she was going to propose. A week before the planned proposal, he told her he was in love with someone else and broke things off with her. This devastated her, and caused her to become very cynical and unsupportive of the relationships around her, even all these years later.   \n\nSix months ago, I got engaged to my best friend (let\u2019s call him Cole). Cole proposed out of the blue; even my family didn\u2019t know about it. When I called my sister to tell her the news, she was shocked to say the least. I could tell by her face that she was less than pleased, and all she managed to say was a very monotone \u201cwow\u201d followed up with \u201cI have to go\u201d. We didn\u2019t speak for weeks after that. Finally she called me to \u201ccatch up\u201d as she put it, and I expressed to her that I was upset with how she reacted to my news. She told me it was a big surprise and she needed time to process. She continued on to say she thinks the engagement is a bad idea and I would regret it if I went through with marrying Cole. When I asked her why she thought that, she told me I am too young to get married and was rushing into it without thinking it through. A week after that conversation she texted me asking when I was planning on asking her to be my MOH. \n\nMy sister has never met Cole in person and has only had a few brief interactions with him over FaceTime. I\u2019m talking like hi and bye maybe a handful of times in the year we were dating prior to the engagement. (We live in different states so that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t met in person.) She\u2019s never spoken poorly of him before, so hearing all of this from her was a shock to say the least. I couldn\u2019t imagine having her stand next to me on my wedding day knowing she thought it was a bad idea so I told her she would not be my MOH due to her not being supportive of my relationship. She never answered me and we haven\u2019t talked since.   \n\nMy dad says because she is my only sister it\u2019s her \u201cright\u201d to stand next to me at my wedding. I told him that Cole and I don\u2019t need anyone there that doesn\u2019t support us so she\u2019s lucky she\u2019s even getting an invitation. This has now circulated through the family and some agree with me and other are on my sister\u2019s side. So, AITA?\n\ntl;dr My sister was not supportive of my engagement but asked when I was planning to make her my MOH. I told her I wasn\u2019t since she was unsupportive and now my family is divided, some saying it\u2019s her \u201cright\u201d to stand next to me since she\u2019s my only sister.", "created_utc": 1676396569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112bbe3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_will_not_be_my_moh/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nobody has a \u2018right\u2019 to any place in your wedding, she\u2019s being incredible entitled.

Or having people watch for her at the wedding in case she tries to pull anything (wear white/a wedding dress, make a scene, etc).

Have you considered your sister is trying to look out for you? She doesn\u2019t want you to get hurt by someone that you think you know, but really you don\u2019t. \nYou know she was caught out by surprise by your announcement, and needed time to consider how to respond. I think her request to be MoH was her way of saying she\u2019d support you.

You do not control your sister's ex.  You should not be penalized by his actions, or your sister's ability to cope with it.  Hopefully, your family will learn to understand that, but there's no guarantee that will ever happen.", "The only thing I could see happening is you and Cole suffering throughout the entire process due to your sister\u2019s negativity.
