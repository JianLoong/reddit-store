He just switched to a different medium.\n\nNTA", "NTA but like others said, this won't cure his addiction and he does need to get help", "Yes you did smash them but you're pregnant with twims and the vapes were a threat to the babies - asshole or protective mother?

People who vape are the worst for not taking accountability over how they do it EVERYWHERE! \nNTA.. he sounds immature with his responses like \"I forgot\" sir your wife's pregnant, wake up!

You employed a temporary and ineffective solution to a much bigger problem. He's just gonna buy more vape pens.

Your being a mother which is about caring and protecting your children. You warned him and he didn\u2019t listen so that\u2019s on him", "ESH. He shouldn't be vaping around you or the kids. Though I think the jury is still out on 2nd-hand vaping being harmful, it should've been enough that you asked him and he should at least relocate himself like, outside when he wants to vape.

And it's not like his addiction magically disappeared when you did that, so he's just gonna buy more.", "NTA - your husband is TA for lying and endangering everyone else.

Or your children\u2019s health? Wow. You are 100% NTA, but your husband is. \n\nHe needs to get his head out of his ass and realise what he was doing to swapping one addiction for another without realising what he is actually doing and the effects it has on both others and himself. \n\nYour health, and that of your children\u2019s should be your number 1 priority, so don\u2019t feel bad about protecting your right to ensuring your babies develop and grow strong with very little complications.", "Nta", "Nta.

The truth is, we just don't know, so for the health of your kids, he shouldn't be vaping near y'all or really even in the house. However, the vapes are his property and you had no right to smash them. He needs to care more about the family's health and quit vaping and you need to be supportive in this process.

Way to make a point stick.", "She could have just hid them.", "That's what I was thinking too. Smashing the pens got a point across, but it will cost money and he may start vaping more in retaliation. I understand pregnancy hormones may have effected this, (I know I would get irrationally angry while pregnant), but you amd your husband need to have a conversation about keeping it outside.

She needs to make a real decision about how much of a dealbreaker this is. I can\u2019t imagine going through to sheer time and effort and emotional toll of IVF while simultaneously asking hundreds of time for him to stop endangering himself and the rest of the family.

The higher end refillable ones range anywhere from 80 to several hundred dollars. OP could have easily just smashed up 1200$ worth of vape pens which her husband is 100% going to replace, meaning that all OP accomplished was shorting them money before twins arrive.\n\nThis is an ESH. The husband needs to respect those around him enough to smoke outside and away from others, his wife needs to accept she married a smoker willingly, that he is who he is and expecting him to change because she doesnt like a trait she accepted when she married him isnt ok, and that destruction of property isn't ok.", "If you're not in the UK they're not.
