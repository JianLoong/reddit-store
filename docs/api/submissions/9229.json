When he\u2019s not in the car, I drive just fine, and I refuse to drive when we go somewhere together. \n\nAlso, your driving history doesn\u2019t matter because you had TWO accidents in the same period of time where your gf had ONE, which her insurance declared wasn\u2019t her fault. Her track record is better than yours. \n\nLeave her alone and shut up. YTA.", "Heels are still easier than work boots, and won't flatten the throttle without you knowing.", "Hahahah. Fair enough.", "I mean I do like her, and I understand her point of view and would like to be nicer to her as she is really nice to me.", "I genuinely do not think that and have told her she drives well in the past. She can maneuver really well and park in hard spots.", "In the past two years one involved another car but it was minor. Before that there have been no accidents besides maybe minor scrapes with objects that I barely remember since I was a teen.\n\nI am a guy so idk about driving in heels so I just said it seems unsafe and I know other women who take them off. I have not observed her having difficulties but just thought I would point it out.", "With driving history of 70+ years between myself and my 2 sisters (three women) we've never had any accidents. This isn't as much of a flex as you think it is and it definitely doesn't give the right to mansplain driving to anyone. As long as the person you're with isn't being careless or reckless, backseat driving is not ok.", "Sounds like you've gotten careless in those years. Literally complaining that she won't speed is a weird one.", "So? I drove accident-free for 10 years, then lost concentration for half a second and destroyed my car. Do you think the previous 10 years of accident-free driving made my passenger feel better about the (luckily injury-free) car accident I subjected him to?\n\nThere were no other cars involved and no one was hurt, just my wallet. But I was still at fault.", "Shut up man. And Grow up. YTA and clearly projecting and jealous for some weird reason", "Your the same age as my partners bestfriend. He had his first accident recently. He was working (he's a long haul truck driver) an idiot came around the corner, lost control of their car and smashed head first into the truck. Guess what the guy was doing?\n\nSpeeding. 10 over is still speeding and still illegal.", "And how many accidents has your girlfriend caused? Cause from the sounds of it maybe she should be lecturing you on your driving", "I get annoyed at people driving slower than the flow of traffic too, but you do not criticize the person driving you for driving at a speed that they are comfortable with. 2 accidents in 2 years is a pattern and you sound like a pretty obnoxious passenger to have in the car with your constant whinging about other drivers.", "No. You were careless. Since you\u2019re such an expert, you should be expert enough to maintain your brakes, and not drive too close to the car in front of you.", "Hey \u201cexpert\u201d your brakes should always be tuned", "I managed to go 20+ years in the same car without a crash. My new one has more safety equipment but you learn to drive to the car and the conditions. You especially drive defensively if you know your car is unequipped safety wise as going to come off worse in crash. And brakes are something you need to maintain because otherwise danger to others on road.", "And after these accidents, did your girlfriend sit down and explain to you the mistakes you made? Or do you think that would have been condescending and overstepping?", "You have an excuse for everything!! But damn, you can't even man up to your own mistakes or your accidents!! You literally said it was your fault and tried to dismiss it as \"just a touch\" and you \"were in the wrong place at the wrong time!\" No , you caused an accident because you weren't being careful not because you happened to be in the \"wrong place, wrong time!\" That's the dumbest excuse ever!!!\n\nAlso as someone with your track record, what on this earth makes you think she should do as you say when driving? You've had multiple accidents, you obviously don't keep up with your breaks, and you have the audacity to tell her how to drive because you don't like that she follows the law!! She sounds like a wayyy safer driver than you!\nWe all are glad she doesn't listen to you and frankly I can't believe she didn't tell you to be quiet sooner!!", "You have a real chip on your shoulder about this poor woman. She\u2019s a better driver than you, had more money, and drives a better car. Is that why you\u2019re so desperate to tear her down? Gotta be better than her somehow?", "I\u2019m pretty sure every instructor, lesson, etc. I have ever heard has said there\u2019s actually no accidents. It\u2019s a wreck bc someone somewhere was just slightly careless for a millisecond too long. So \u201cjust a touch\u201d is not wrong place wrong time, it\u2019s you being careless and not 100% focused behind the wheel. You clearly know your cars limits - drive to them.", "\"weaker brakes\" is not a thing. If your brakes are sluggish, you need to have them seen to by a mechanic", "Dude. I\u2019ve been driving for 25 years and have never been in an accident. The majority of my driving years I drove older vehicles (p.s. if you maintain your vehicle\u2019s breaks and tires breaking shouldn\u2019t be a problem). Regardless, you are not helping her with your constant driving advice. If anything, you are a distraction. Women have been listening to men explain driving to them for too long.* It\u2019s obnoxious and needs to stop. \n\n*this a generalization of course.", "Aaaaand now we hear why OP needs to put down his girlfriend for being better at life (including driving) than he is \n\nI hope she gets sick of this quickly and leaves you to groan to yourself about lady drivers driving too safely and not playing bumper cars with you on the freeway.", "No you were driving too fast and/or following too close.", "Sounds like you're jealous of your girlfriend.", "It IS illegal to drive above the speed limit, *even to match the flow of traffic*. She's following the law. Unless you plan to pay for her tickets and take her points onto your license, you can STFU.", "No actually it\u2019s not, the people speeding are the ones breaking the law and she\u2019s driving the speed limit and driving safely. Climb out of your own ass and stop defending yourself, listen to what allllll these people are saying. YTA", "If the others drive faster than what they should, it's their error and it's them who make the road less safe; not who respect the limits and rules. I always drive the limit speed, if people are bothered by it they can leave their home earlier instead of having to run on the road \ud83e\udd37", "The right lane of the freeway is literally for people who are driving the speed limit. Your gf has to drive recklessly just because everyone else is?", "Driving will the the flow of traffic does NOT reduce the risk of a crash. Driving above the speed limit is illegal and more dangerous.", "So your suggestion is for her to drive illegally?", "It is illegal to speed. Just because other people are speeding doesn't make it legal. A judge would literally laugh in your face if you tried to get out of a speeding ticket because of what other people were driving", "She\u2019s following the law. Seems like you could learn from her if anything", "She shouldn\u2019t drive faster than she\u2019s comfortable, presuming she\u2019s complying with the law for minimum speed. I would have dumped you already tbh", "Just because everyone else is driving recklessly doesn't mean you should drive recklessly. Your gf should be giving you tips on how to not cause an accident.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udfc6", "Have you considered that maybe you have an unconscious bias and unknowingly point out more women than men? Even if you say you don't see the gender.", ">I really do not think she is a bad driver and never said that to her.\n\nYou have kind of implied it every single time you've been driven by her, though. With all the unsolicited advice.", "Barefoot IS illegal\nEdit- I stand corrected.", "It\u2019s funny because men are the only people who have criticised my driving. They also never believe that I own the car that I do. \u201cThat\u2019s too much car for a little lady like you\u201d  \nMy favourite happened last week. \n\nI was rear ended WHILE STOPPED at a red light. \nLast week some AH at the grocery store asked me what I backed into. That I should be more careful with my husbands car. \n\nThat\u2019s MY car, Sir.", "I think she is upset because each time you point out another driver's mistake you are actually focusing on her. When you pepper your trips with driving lessons for your girlfriend, she gets the message that her driving skills are somehow lacking. When clearly she is as good a driver or better than you. Take this as your driving critique: Don't give driving advice unless you are asked for it. \n\n Relax, Listen to music, take a nap; let the lady drive! \n\n(YTA)", "You're a back seat driver. Ew", "> 1.\t\u2060A car cut the car in front of me off, they stopped hard and I hit the car in front of me, I was at fault\n\nDriving slower would have been your friend here. It may be safer after all.\n\n> 2.\t\u2060Side of my car made contact with a gate while turning (obviously my fault but the wind had moved the gate), no insurance claim since it was minor.\n\nTaking a beat to assess probably would have helped you see the gate was pushed out.\n\nJust saying maybe don\u2019t be so quick to criticize others. Perhaps driving \u201clike you\u2019re taking a drivers test\u201d isn\u2019t always a bad idea.", "So you were following too close, and rear-ended another car and yet, she\u2019s the bad driver and needs her driving critiqued. Interesting logic.", "1. A car cut the car in front of me off, they stopped hard and I hit the car in front of me, I was at fault\n2. Side of my car made contact with a gate while turning (obviously my fault but the wind had moved the gate), no insurance claim since it was minor.\n\nFor my gf, someone else turned into her lane at an intersection and side swiped her.\n\n--\u2010------------\nI want to post a few dozen laugh emojis here but people hate them so use your imagination. Do you even read what you are typing?", "So you were driving too close and too fast. Then you hit a fence... you want to brush those things that were your fault off while blaming her for the accident someone else caused. YTA. \nOur society loves to pretend women are worse drivers, but the evidence shows it is men.", "Yes, I can definitely understand why your girlfriend doesn't want you driving her car. You should have been leaving enough of a gap to be able to respond to what was happening in front. If you often drive too close to the car in front and don't give yourself enough reaction time then I totally understand why your girlfriend wouldn't feel safe entrusting her car with you unless she absolutely had to. I grew up with my dad driving too close to other people and it's very worrying.", "Maybe if you had been doing the speed limit you could have stopped in time ?", "I wouldn\u2019t let you drive my perfect condition 2019 car either if that was the case. YTA don\u2019t nitpick in your gfs driving and maybe just give her advice when she\u2019s making REAL mistakes like how to avoid hitting the curb on a turn if you yourself even know how to do that", "Again stop! You are not going to ge ticket for driving the speed limit. What part of LIMIT is not computing for you?", "The type of heel can matter to some. I've driven in heavy duty steel toe boots, and 5 inch high heels.

That\u2019s the best you can come up with? Good lord.", "You sound like a former partner of mine. Why do strangers have to tell you how to act? She already told you. Listen to the person you claim to love.", "Oh my god, this is how you talk about your long-term girlfriend???!! YIKES", "Then legitimately shut up", "But she\u2019s getting upset at your constant \u201cgentle suggestions\u201d which is basically a critique of her driving. So yeah, that\u2019s what she thinks whether you\u2019ve said it or not.", "Her blow up shows that frequent criticism certainly feels that way to her.  You made her feel this way- no one else.", "Maybe you could be better at parking if you took a moment to assess the situation the way you described her doing.", "have you considered that other women (gasp) have preferences when they drive!!?? and other people may be comfortable with other things?? maybe keep in mind she may be uncomfortable going over the speed limit or doing many tiny adjustments while parallel parking and, get this, not everyone is you!!!", "Rear-ending someone isn\u2019t minor.. nice try though", "You admit you don't actually know anything about driving in heels, but you insist you know better than her that they are dangerous despite all evidence to the contrary. That level of mansplaining would be exhausting.", "Agreed.  The speed limit is the maximum you are allowed to drive not the minimum. And anyone telling you it's safer to drive \"with the crowd\" is lying to you. \n\nThis is how you get a ticket and are much more likely to have a fatal crash.", "She did not but I would not have minded it.

I will check my biases and stop commenting while my gf drives unless it is something critical or if she asks me.", "Saw a car trying to \"go with traffic\" and the person in their lane was going the 65 speed limit, so they jumped to the carpool lane going 85+ like the other 3 lanes SEEMED to be, only to rear-end a van so hard they lifted the vans ass end and shoved them to the other side of the highway, and got enough air, that had they been a bit more angled, they would've went OVER the barrier and right into the carpool lane I was in on the other side.

But the way you talk about kindness as if it\u2019s purely transactional is beyond the pale. You should want to be nice to her because you *care* about her, not because she \u201cearned\u201d it by being nice to you.", "Yikes!!", "All in all, quite normal behaviour from a man, actually.
