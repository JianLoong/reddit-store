So yesterday my brother and I were helping my parents move and were hauling boxes from their old house to the new house using both of our cars. When we got to the old house, I asked my brother for a lighter for my cigarette, he told me to grab it from his cup holder. As I reached in, I noticed he had an air freshener dangling from his rear view.\nI told him that in our state, it's illegal to have anything hanging from the rear view. I told him I got pulled over and was told to remove my air freshener and put it on the turn signal handle. He scoffed and said that's a stupid law, and the cop that enforced it was bored and they have bigger issues to deal with than air freshners. I agreed but the law is the law,  and I was annoyed he didn't heed my warnings. Now as I'm following him to our parents new home, we stop at a light. Guess who pulls up behind me? A police officer. An idea pops into my head to help drive my point home. We're both in the left lane so I hit my turn signal and pull into the right one so now I'm on his right side and the cop pulls up behind my brother. Next thing you know as the light turns green and we continue driving down the street, the officer pulls him over! I pull into the gas station next to where the cop made the stop and watch the officer get out and ask my brother for his ID, registration, and insurance. Now unbeknownst to me my brother was not carrying his insurance paper with him. He asked why he was pulled over, she told him it was because he had an air freshener dangling from his rear view which it's illegal to have anything hanging from there in our state (I told him so!) She goes back to her car and comes out a little while later with a ticket for driving without proof of insurance. It's a 280 dollar charge but if he contests in court and brings his insurance showing he was insured at that time it wil be dropped. She let's him off with a warning and heads on her way. I texted him \"told you so\" and followed him back to the new home. He calls me irate while driving behind him and says \"what is that supposed to mean?\" I told him because he didn't want to listen to me, I intentionally pulled into the next lane to A. For my own entertainment to see if he'd get pulled over and B. To tell him I told you so. He blows up on me and calls me an asshole and tells our parents. My dad grimaced and told my brother he shouldn't of let himself be put in that situation and told me I had been childish. My mom was upset with me and told me to apologize. When I got home and told my wife, she looked disgusted and said who does that? In my mind he broke the law, not my fault.
