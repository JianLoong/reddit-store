So yesterday my brother and I were helping my parents move and were hauling boxes from their old house to the new house using both of our cars. When we got to the old house, I asked my brother for a lighter for my cigarette, he told me to grab it from his cup holder. As I reached in, I noticed he had an air freshener dangling from his rear view.\nI told him that in our state, it's illegal to have anything hanging from the rear view. I told him I got pulled over and was told to remove my air freshener and put it on the turn signal handle. He scoffed and said that's a stupid law, and the cop that enforced it was bored and they have bigger issues to deal with than air freshners. I agreed but the law is the law,  and I was annoyed he didn't heed my warnings. Now as I'm following him to our parents new home, we stop at a light. Guess who pulls up behind me? A police officer. An idea pops into my head to help drive my point home. We're both in the left lane so I hit my turn signal and pull into the right one so now I'm on his right side and the cop pulls up behind my brother. Next thing you know as the light turns green and we continue driving down the street, the officer pulls him over! I pull into the gas station next to where the cop made the stop and watch the officer get out and ask my brother for his ID, registration, and insurance. Now unbeknownst to me my brother was not carrying his insurance paper with him. He asked why he was pulled over, she told him it was because he had an air freshener dangling from his rear view which it's illegal to have anything hanging from there in our state (I told him so!) She goes back to her car and comes out a little while later with a ticket for driving without proof of insurance. It's a 280 dollar charge but if he contests in court and brings his insurance showing he was insured at that time it wil be dropped. She let's him off with a warning and heads on her way. I texted him \"told you so\" and followed him back to the new home. He calls me irate while driving behind him and says \"what is that supposed to mean?\" I told him because he didn't want to listen to me, I intentionally pulled into the next lane to A. For my own entertainment to see if he'd get pulled over and B. To tell him I told you so. He blows up on me and calls me an asshole and tells our parents. My dad grimaced and told my brother he shouldn't of let himself be put in that situation and told me I had been childish. My mom was upset with me and told me to apologize. When I got home and told my wife, she looked disgusted and said who does that? In my mind he broke the law, not my fault.

To use this post to say I would've been a nazi sympathizer is very unkind of you. This was not a question of life or death.", "I feel like 20 years ago you needed to, not anymore, maybe that's just in California. The papers in the car aren't even very good proof, any bozo can sign up for an insurance plan and print out what looks like a 6 month policy but then stop paying and get canceled. Not sure why the cops bother, should just check a registry that reports whether there's active insurance.", "It's a fair point, though.", "good point. Batman would probably laugh in this AH's face.", "But you said people have a dirty to obey the law whether it's right or wrong.", "You're the same guy that went to his recently dead friends home to deliver condolences and then asked his family for the money you loaned him. You love the law but lack decency so yea it does sound like you would be a nazi back then.", "\u201cjust following orders\u201d is literally the tagline of the nuremberg trials dude", "\"bUt ItS tHE lAw\"", "You screwed your own brother over for an \u201cI told you so\u201d.  Which leads me to question, how badly do you treat people in general? To me, if you\u2019re happy treating your own FLESH AND BLOOD that way, you\u2019re likely way worse and harsher to those lucky enough to NOT be related to you. Are we supposed to assume you make good choices beyond that? Because given the information, that YOU provided, you seem like a jerk and I have no reason to believe you aren\u2019t.", "Many police interactions result in death. Putting him in that position was a dick move but also potentially dangerous for him. YTA", "You literally got your brother pulled over for *an air freshener* and say you supposedly don\u2019t like \u201claw-breakers.\u201d Lol.", "Ao people can choose to obey the law or not to obey?  You're contradicting yourself.  \n\nYTA", "They do give tickets if you don't have your paper or can't pull it up on your app. They don't take the time to look. They give you ticket for whatever they pulled you over for and no insurance. Then you have to bring proof in to get that part of the ticket thrown out.", "I know in VA (at least the small sheriffs department that pulled me for fund raising last year, and yes I know it\u2019s fund raising as this county is in the top 10 counties for percent of county budget funded by traffic tickets in the state) pulled registration and insurance electronically. Deputy asked for my license and walked back to his car. All of us thought I was going to get a warning since he only asked for the license\u2026 came back with a $140 ticket. All of us still question the accuracy of the speed he claimed but it was allegedly recorded on laser so that\u2019s pretty hard to fight and wasn\u2019t worth most of a day to get to this small town and go to court. Not that I\u2019m still salty or anything."]}
