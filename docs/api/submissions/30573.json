Then she met Kane and they got married. Kane has a daughter Mia who is 8 now. She was 2 when my mom and Kane got married. So I wasn't super into the idea of mom and Kane. I liked it being just the two of us. Things were good and I didn't like Kane all that much. I guess he's fine. But he's very... cocky and believes he is way more important than he is. He has talked for years about how miserable I was not having a man in the house and how I was a miserable, struggling kid because I had a single mom and no dad. None of this is true but he likes to believe it is. But anyway, he's always had this cocky attitude that I didn't vibe with and I was happy with it being just mom and me.\n\nThen one day we had mine and mom's family and Kane's family over. My mom got really into filming every moment after meeting Kane and she was recording us all that day. Then she and Kade asked me how I would feel if they got married in front of everyone and if I wanted that. I told them I didn't and I liked it being just me and mom. Mom recorded the whole thing. They even asked if I wasn't excited to be Mia's big sister and I said no. Again I was 11. And again mom recorded the whole thing. It was awkward. My grandparents told mom two or three times to turn off her camera and mom just kept recording as I showed my disinterested in the idea of them getting married.\n\nMom and Kane got married anyway and life moved on. It's okay. It's not terrible. I would not say life is better because of it though. Still not that into Kane either. I think someone really needs to take him down several notches with the cockiness.\n\nApparently mom and Kane told me for years that I had really wanted us to be a family and I had always wanted to be her sister. They said I had given my blessing for the wedding and my number one reason was I wanted her. I think you get where this is going. Mom got the recording of the day they asked me for my blessing onto a USB with other home movies she shot. Mia was looking through mom's many home movies and saw that one and she was so upset. She asked me if I had wanted her as a sister back then and it came out of nowhere so I asked what she was talking about. It upset her more and mom was home and she went to her then. Mom then told her that I had lied about that stuff over the years and she was so sorry she heard all that and stuff. Then she told her that they had wanted to protect her from me and all kinds of other stuff and to shield her from the truth. I waited until Mia wasn't around and I confronted mom and told her she does not get to call me a liar when I have never lied. I told her she was the liar and she threw me under the bus for something I had no part in.\n\nMom yelled at me and said none of this would be happening if I'd been happier and embraced our family back then.

But having your mom/step-dad pretend that you wanted the same thing as them is either delusional (at best) or manipulative/abusive (at worst). I\u2019m leaning towards the latter because you started to believe that you wanted this family from the beginning and only remembered your true feelings when the video resurfaced.", "Honestly, if you're in a situation where you're not ok with calling her 'sister', but you're still fond of her (and clearly you care, you rightly did you best to make sure your discussion with your mom didn't hurt her), you can frame it like this: \"We're not sisters, yeah.  But that doesn't matter.  Because sisters have to be close (side note, I know thats not 100 percent true, but bear with me), and we don't have to either.  We choose to, and that makes it more special.\"\n\nThe label isn't important, not really.  The closeness and caring does.  Emphasize that.", "OP, if your sister asks why you don't like her or talks about the video, the best thing to do is to try to correct the damage your mother has caused, so don't tell her the truth. You can say that you were frustrated or angry with your mother at the time, you can even use examples of when your sister said or did something similar out of frustration. She doesn't have the maturity to understand your situation at the time and she probably won't be able to cope with rejection. You'll have to be the mature one in this family since your mother only knows how to ruin everything. NTA.", "Ah yes, it's all thanks to Kane. He's just so... so amazing. He's the perfect man, husband, dad and just meeting him one time is enough to make you an incredible person too. /s", "A better way to approach it would be to ask Mia how she might feel if the adults brought in a new woman with a  very young kid. Would MIA be excited that her whole home life was about to change? Or use the example of moving to a new school.", "Ever thought about how people are not tropes and characters from tv shows?", "And then everyone clapped?", "He also has a side job as a superhero.  I think they call him The Deep.", "Yes, everyone clapped and they bowed as he passed them and they cried tears of pure joy because they met the greatest person to ever live. /s", "I wish I knew him better, but I already feel like a better person just reading about him on the internet.\n\nAt this point, I refuse to add /s because if people can't understand the sarcasm without it, they're helpless (or the aliens from Galaxy Quest)", "By Grabthar's Hammer!"]}
