Then she met Kane and they got married. Kane has a daughter Mia who is 8 now. She was 2 when my mom and Kane got married. So I wasn't super into the idea of mom and Kane. I liked it being just the two of us. Things were good and I didn't like Kane all that much. I guess he's fine. But he's very... cocky and believes he is way more important than he is. He has talked for years about how miserable I was not having a man in the house and how I was a miserable, struggling kid because I had a single mom and no dad. None of this is true but he likes to believe it is. But anyway, he's always had this cocky attitude that I didn't vibe with and I was happy with it being just mom and me.\n\nThen one day we had mine and mom's family and Kane's family over. My mom got really into filming every moment after meeting Kane and she was recording us all that day. Then she and Kade asked me how I would feel if they got married in front of everyone and if I wanted that. I told them I didn't and I liked it being just me and mom. Mom recorded the whole thing. They even asked if I wasn't excited to be Mia's big sister and I said no. Again I was 11. And again mom recorded the whole thing. It was awkward. My grandparents told mom two or three times to turn off her camera and mom just kept recording as I showed my disinterested in the idea of them getting married.\n\nMom and Kane got married anyway and life moved on. It's okay. It's not terrible. I would not say life is better because of it though. Still not that into Kane either. I think someone really needs to take him down several notches with the cockiness.\n\nApparently mom and Kane told me for years that I had really wanted us to be a family and I had always wanted to be her sister. They said I had given my blessing for the wedding and my number one reason was I wanted her. I think you get where this is going. Mom got the recording of the day they asked me for my blessing onto a USB with other home movies she shot. Mia was looking through mom's many home movies and saw that one and she was so upset. She asked me if I had wanted her as a sister back then and it came out of nowhere so I asked what she was talking about. It upset her more and mom was home and she went to her then. Mom then told her that I had lied about that stuff over the years and she was so sorry she heard all that and stuff. Then she told her that they had wanted to protect her from me and all kinds of other stuff and to shield her from the truth. I waited until Mia wasn't around and I confronted mom and told her she does not get to call me a liar when I have never lied. I told her she was the liar and she threw me under the bus for something I had no part in.\n\nMom yelled at me and said none of this would be happening if I'd been happier and embraced our family back then. She told me she was doing her best with Mia who didn't need to have her heart shattered by me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699464426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qqpjx/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_lied_to_my_stepsister/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was never any reason to tell your step-sister that you always wanted to be her big sister, etc. And if she was going to lie to her then she should have deleted that video or edited your part out. This is 100% on your mother.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't have the courage to look facts in the eyes. It is all there on the usb-stick, yet she refuses to take it in. That is not your fault. If you choose to make a distance between your mother and yourself later on, maybe go low contact or no contact with her and Kane, it will be her own fault. If people ask her, she will tell them that she doesn't understand it. Although it is all there for her to see, staring her in the face.", "Wooooow NTA\nYour mom and step dad are lying and gaslighting their own children. Even when confronted with evidence! That's really messed up. I hope you'll have therapy to unpack that... And that you're able to gtfo as soon as possible. That's simply not a healthy environment.", "NTA. Lying is a bad idea.", "NTA - Any issues with Mia are completely on your mom and Kane. You were 11 years old, and it seems like your mom rushed into this without consideration for you. I do hope your relationship with Kane and your step sister have improved.", "ooooof\n\nNTA\n\nNone of this would have happened if she hadn't married Kane. Not that it would specifically be better or worse in total. But it wouldn't be happening. It is just a nonsensical way to attribute responsibility for the current state of things. \n\nYesterday someone got in a car accident. If they had left the house 5 minutes earlier they would not have even been in that spot to get into the accident. But that delay is not the cause of the accident.", "NTA.\n\nYou were 11 and you were honest. Your mom doesn\u2019t get to erase how you felt just because she didn\u2019t agree. \n\nWatching your mom marry someone who you don\u2019t particularly like is hard. Doesn\u2019t help that your stepdad clearly thinks he\u2019s the almighty. Doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to throw you under the bus though. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have lied either.

You and Mia both deserve better parents.", "NTA. Talk to your sister about it though. Tell her that it was a long time ago and your feelings have changed, and explain your side as to why you weren\u2019t happy with the union. Remind her that it took time before you 2 came to your current relationship, and that Your parents don\u2019t determine your relationships.

Your mom was expecting an 11-year-old to be gracious about accepting a new 2-year-old stepsister and stepfather? You were being honest, and your feelings were valid, even if Kane was as awesome as he seems to think he is.\n\nWhen I got engaged to my wife (30+ years ago), her niece (and mine now, too) said she hated me. I did not take it personally, as I understood how much she loved her aunt and was jealous of the time I was spending with her. Personally, I found it funny at the time, because I (22M at the time) understood where she was coming from. As an aside, when her announcement to everyone that she hated me didn't get the reaction she was looking for, she then announced she hated Santa Claus (she was 5 at the time), and when that still didn't get a reaction she said she hated Jesus. *That* got a reaction, so she was done with her vent. I still laugh at this and remember it fondly for some reason.\n\nMy point is simply that kids will be kids, and you were just expressing your honest opinion at the time. Your mom later lied about it to your stepsister, and to be honest, I understand *why* she did that. However, she should've deleted that recording of you saying you didn't want to be her sister as your grandparents suggested. And she ABSOLUTELY shouldn't have thrown you under the bus when her house of cards collapsed.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

He thinks so highly of himself lol.", "What am I an AH for?", "Because she told the truth?", "Why did I sound like an AH kid?", "The name isn't his real name. Kane would be closer to it. I'll edit it all to that.", "My feelings haven't changed all that much. I actually think Mia is a pretty sweet kid but overall I still can't say I'm glad my mom married Kane or anything like that.", "That's very considerate of you. What's your relationship like with Mia now? (before the events of this post, I mean.) Maybe you could explain to her that that was how you felt then but that you're happy to have her around now, if that's true. If not, I suggest leaving it alone unless Mia keeps bringing it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit to add NTA either way", "You should have corrected her in front of the kid.", "You're not. The person who said you are doesn't know what they're talking about.", "General AH vibe and attitude. From the way you described all of this, you are like the character in a movie that is maybe not the most popular and judges everyone else without knowing them, based on superficial traits, but in reality you are the AH. (eg. the new Velma, Princess Brides\u2019 friend Lily or the fat girl from Booksmart). I\u2019m not saying that you should change or anything but at least accept it lol", "It's complicated. She did want to hang out with me a lot and I always thought that was just her being a young kid who knew me always pretty much. Clearly she was also led to believe I felt a certain way.\n\nI think she's a sweet kid. I don't mind hanging out with her sometimes. But I also would not consider her just my sister and I don't think of her as someone I am that close to really. I feel like they were so cruel to her with the lie and I feel bad about that.\n\nI just don't know if I could talk to her about this without hurting her more or tell my own lies, even white lies.", "Eh, I feel like that would have been unfair to Mia. She was already upset and the whole thing sucks for her too. No need for her to witness a fight as well.", "I don't judge people really. Do I judge Kane? Oh yeah. But he's one of the rare people who I spent time with and really didn't like and my opinion on him never changed.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm popular but I have a group of friends and we're all close. I like kind people. I dislike people who are too cocky.", "Have you tried talking to Mia one on one?", "How are you so much more mature than your mom?\n\nMust be Kane's awesome parenting skills. /s", "I just described the character trope, not everything has to fully be applicable to your situation. The general vibes you give off based on the post is that of this character trope. \n\nBut hey, I\u2019m just a random person on the internet that clearly likes to meddle into other\u2019s business, you can ignore it\u2026"]}
