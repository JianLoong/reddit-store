But you act like it\u2019s your RIGHT to demand explanations and justifications from 2 people who raised you, put food in your mouth, roof over your head when you were too young to do for yourself. Then, when the life your parents provided you helped you work/learn the skills you\u2019d need to be self sufficient, instead of kicking you out at that point, they LET you continue to live there without demanding money from you. All they asked was for you to pitch in by taking your siblings to school. You yourself stated that the 400 you pay was your own idea for your own reasons.  But that\u2019s where your business ends. The rest in none of your business. \nYou only have a say in how you choose to perceive the situation and on how you choose to respond.  You can ask for an explanation because you want to understand why. But not as an ultimatum for getting your way. \nYou need to set aside how you feel you \u201cshould\u201d be treated.  Assess and evaluate your practical choices.   Choice 1: move out and risk possible undesirable roommate. Pay \u00a3800 per month. Plus, cost of food, utilities, etc\u2026.  No more need to work around siblings school schedule but when determining potential monthly budget, allow for your own transportation costs because you may not find a place as close to work as your parents house.  Choice 2: assess and evaluate the effect on your current income and expenses an added 400 per month will have on your budget.  HOWEVER, if both choices are truly out of your budget. Like you just do not earn enough to cover the amount they are asking for, present an easy clear printout or email, power point, bank statements, etc.. showing your parents what your budget allows you to pay them. And just like they don\u2019t have to justify how they spend their \u00a3, you don\u2019t have to justify yours. However, in real world, when you lease a place to live, most credible leasing companies/private owners require proof of appropriate income amount from potential leaser before they can be approved to lease a space. Here in the states renters have to provide proof of income that is three times more than rent per month before being approved. Because they know that just because a person can pay rent it doesn\u2019t mean they can pay for all the other expenses (like healthcare \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude2b)too. So it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for your parents to ask you for proof if you claim you cannot afford their rent hike.   You don\u2019t actually have any practical negotiating room.  If you look at this from a purely monetary standpoint, even with the doubled rent, and continued escorting siblings to school 5 days a week, in any other situation where you were only dealing with strangers, \u00a3800 a month is still a pretty good deal.  \nAnd I bet you are the only one involved who doesn\u2019t already know that.  \nAt least your parent are giving you a reasonable choice. They could\u2019ve just kicked you out. Made you sink or swim. And you beyond naive and ungrateful if you think that\u2019s not happening everyday to people a LOT less fortunate than you. \nPs: unless you parents have a history of screwing over their kids that you neglected to share here, this seemingly out of character demand is coming from a non-greedy place. Maybe it\u2019s served more than one purpose for them and that can include them considering what best not just for you at this moment but what\u2019s best for whole family further down the line. They still have two kids to provide for the next several years. Then they have to plan for their own future and retirement age.  Yes it would\u2019ve been more productive, diplomatic and less stressful if they just explained (not justified)things for you but that\u2019s not reality. Which is all you truly have to work with here. Use your power of discernment and deduction . Give your parents the benefit of the doubt if you know them to generally be good parents and people.\nAnd again, unless there are negative details about your parents your are not sharing, I\u2019m having a difficult time believing this came up out of the blue. No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lying. Not at all. But I\u2019m guessing that even before they made a specific demand , they preceded it  with talking to you about things related to it.

Did the OP claim that her job does not pay her enough for her to afford it?  In fact, did the OP claim they have asked her for any $ before this?  The only thing they asked her for was to help them out by taking her siblings to school in mornings and she tried to shirk that off too. The OP clearly stated that the $400 plus some extra she gave them up to this pint, was purely a voluntary choice.  OF COURSE, our kids should not be treated as investments made for the sole purpose of getting a return later on for the investment!  And nothing in OP\u2019s complaints/story says otherwise. Your OP is not voicing fears of homelessness. The OP is complaining about possibly having to share rent with someone he/she may not like!  She complains about the high cost of living in her area, but doesn\u2019t flat out say her job does not pay her enough to afford it either. Her complaint is based purely on the fact that she, or he has become accustomed to a life or she can live in a way she likes without having to pay, the real life cost.  The OP is a person who is already 26 years old. Just like children are not meant to be investments that are required to provide an investment return, neither are parents obligated to provide the same level of care and support(monetarily speaking) for the rest of the child\u2019s natural life. NOR, are they obligated to explain and justify how they choose to manage their income and budget to said 26 year old child they have been allowing to live with them.  The OP has not claimed that her parents have a history of greediness or cruelty or anything close to that. And other than this so-called out of the blue, $400 more for rent demand, the OP does not mention any sort of bad behavior from the parents. Going off script and based on deduction, I\u2019d be willing to bet that his/her parents may not have said point blank \u201cwe think you should pay us $800\u201d but they probably tried more indirect approaches related to the topic. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of denial and how easily people use selective listening when they don\u2019t want to hear it. Regardless, I DO think the parents could\u2019ve been more diplomatic and employed better communication with the OP. Practically speaking (and if the events went down as OP claims) the parents could\u2019ve saved theirWHOLE family a lot of time, energy and drama had they provided the OP an explanation. Not a justification. I doubt that you or anyone would appreciate the child, whose diapers you changed it one point, demanding you to justify your financial decisions.  These parents did their job. They fulfilled their parental obligations. The parents never threatened to withhold their love and moral support. But even those traits are not obligatory. They are freely given. and should never be taken for granted.", "\u201cThey provided the bare legal minimum and didn\u2019t force you into homelessness, so they don\u2019t need to explain why they\u2019re suddenly doubling your rent\u201d isn\u2019t a very compelling argument. Yes, they legally could have kicked op out at 18 or charged them market rate rent, but that\u2019s kind of an asshole move to do to your kids. As it stands, they\u2019re profiting off their kid. Doubling the rent means OP will have less money to put towards moving out. OP moving out right now means the parents would need to pay their own bills and arrange transportation for their other kids, and no \u00a3400. I think it\u2019s fair to want an explanation for why they prefer either of those situations to the current setup.", "An example: I like things to be very clean and hate clutter on the sides (like in the kitchen) whereas potential roommate is more lax on cleaning. That sort of thing", "Their reasoning is unknown to me. Just that they want me to pay more. That is why I am hesitant because \u00a3400 is a lot of money.

Most of your questions I'm going to ignore, I usually don't engage bad faith responses but whatever, I've got a little poop time left.\n\nI offered advice and my thoughts on how the parent/child commitment should really work - I'm not really into this whole \"you're an adult now\" time to completely change who I am to you and what I'm willing to do. I read OP's post, some comments, and gave my thoughts based upon that. I think you should take a closer read to what I said and dial back the outrage by about 16% there Squirrely Dan (Letterkenny reference, relax Reddit).\n\n I still think parent's should do whatever it takes to provide their commitment (that they made, on their own, knowing full well the results) a good life, good skills, and elevate them as high as possible towards success and self-sufficiency, even if they live in a more permanent family unit. In the latter case, of course bills get split as best as possible (in example, disability assistance really sucks here in America, I'm totally okay charging a disabled individual living on government income less. It just be like that sometimes.)\n\nEdit: Also, OP pays water and eletric and extra $400 on top (along with free bus rides to school, which OP had to make an arrangement with their job to do) AND parent's have no mortage? Do they want OP to pay their car loan too? Ffs.", "You are covering water and electric. Are you covering gas, council tax and any groceries which have gone up by up to 40% in the UK in the last year? Council tax went up 15% in my neighbouring London borough in April. My mobile contract went up 14% in April. \n\nAre you covering broadband, phone, streaming? Any contents insurance which is pushed up by your items? Pay your own travelcard? Do your parents drive while you walk the kids to school but then they do the pricier pick up with ULEZ hitting or that they have to reduce their hours to fit childcare? \n\nMy costs as a single person running a household in London have gone up about 60% on this time last year when everything from basic toiletries, OTC meds, travel, cleaning products, toilet roll, laundry stuff plus everything else I mentioned is included. The only reason it\u2019s not more like 80% for me is because I\u2019m a council tenant and my rent structure is different but milk was a pound last year and it\u2019s \u00a31.55 now. Do you see where your parents might have a 50% jump in costs and not think they need to explain basic household living to a 26 year old able bodied adult?\n\nAnd FYI there is always something needs doing to a house and a need to be putting a bit aside in case the boiler goes boom. That is factored into house maintenance and insurance in your household budget. Plus I assume as UK your siblings will need uniform depending on age.\n\nYou are paying the two metered most easy to adapt cost by just being sensible bills and your parents have given you a massive credit boost if they\u2019ve put them in your name and also helped you get necessary documents for things like opening bank accounts and other stuff you\u2019ll need to do. Utility bills are still a huge part of UK ID and if you have a history with them you are more able to rent without resorting to pre-pay meters or needing guarantors. That in itself is worth a fortune in today\u2019s market with landlords and agents.\n\nI\u2019m from a devolved nation in the UK and my bill history didn\u2019t count for a credit history when I moved to London. It took me years to get to the stage where I had enough credit to accompany having the cash to rent or take out contracts and it was a huge PITA. Your parents are being pretty fair at a time when the majority of UK households are really struggling.\n\nI\u2019m 45 and it hasn\u2019t been this tough financially for most since the proper days of Thatcher in the 80s. I\u2019m kinda glad I grew up then and the frugality is engrained because a lot of my friends have been absolutely wrecked not really knowing how to budget while costs have soared.\n\nNAH. Yet. But you are pushing your luck.

If they don't do the work around the house, do you shout at them, demanding that they \"pay their way\" or else they're out on the street?\n\nYou decided to be a parent, you now have responsibilities. Don't act like you're such a charitable good person because you *GASP* fed, clothed, and sheltered your child.", "yeah, i don\u2019t get all of the people saying that\u2019s the purpose. what\u2019s the point in taking even more of the money the OP might have been able to save for a new place? the only way this move makes sense is if they\u2019re going to give it back to OP as a surprise when they find a place, otherwise it\u2019s kind of their fault it\u2019s going to take even longer", "if it\u2019s actually london, it is way more expensive to have a car and commute than it is in many other cities as they\u2019re actively trying to reduce the amount of people driving. people pay fees to keep them and gas is triple what it costs on the states. even moving out of the city would cost about as much if OP had to add that in to get to work. if they want her to move out, taking even more out of her saving ability is not the way unless they\u2019re saving that extra 400 for her", "yeah\u2026 my dad, who paid for his entire college tuition and rent for the year with his summer job at taco bell in the 70s, thought this type of thing would be the answer too and then found out his nearly six figure salary couldn\u2019t afford the rent of some of the lowest income places, at the job he\u2019d worked in for 30 years with a pension and benefits. cost of living has priced out the working class entirely almost everywhere", "It's probably more that they don't see themselves housing their adult daughter forever and regular price hikes are a not-so-friendly push to get the hell out.", "I assumed the thought was that OP would refuse and instead move out", "Even if it is actually London and the market rate part of my response is wrong, the rest of it is still 100% correct. Op's parents do not owe her an explanation for why they want to increase rent. She is a 26-year-old adult living in their home and they are within their rights to charge any amount, even a completely unreasonable amount, and simply refusing to pay the increase and demanding reasons for why they want it is entitled as all f*ck.\n\nThe reason doesn't even matter. It's not like she can refuse if she doesn't like it. And it's not a negotiation. Like she points out, the house is paid off, they don't actually need her money. She doesn't have anything to bargain with here except their sympathy, and if they are demanding this increase, she's probably used that up already with this entitled attitude.", "You clearly aren\u2019t \u2018clicking\u2019 w/your parents.", "\"Sure, it can be $800. But you need to prorate it for kiddie chauffeur and babysitter down to $500. If not, childcare is on you\"", "They definitely will not. That is high rent for a room in the UK, even in London. Nevermind as a lodger with minimal rights living in a family home with young children.", ">Do you see where your parents might have a 50% jump in costs\n\nIt was never costing the OP's parents \u00a3400/month to house her in the first place, especially when she pays the water and electric bills on top of that and also means they don't have to spend money on childcare. Council tax is the same for 2 parents as it is for 2 parents plus 1 adult, so that doesn't go up when the OP moves in and will be exactly the same when she moves out. There may be a gas bill, but there may not be - not everyone has gas. The internet bill is the same regardless of the number of people, and there is no mortgage. So the only thing the parents are definitely paying extra for is food, and \u00a3400 will buy you a lot of food.", "yeah, they could easily just tell her what the thought process is. if cost of living jumped beyond their means, why not just say that? they inherited their property which means they\u2019re not paying into it like many have to, and they won\u2019t extend that relief to their own offspring after benefiting from it themselves? idg why people say they don\u2019t need to explain it. technically, they don\u2019t have to, but everyone laying out the reasoning on both ends is transactionally the best way to preserve the relationship. if OP provided all of the information, they\u2019re benefiting from her still being there, and charging her more would only hamstring her by taking away the money needed to relocate. so, they should communicate their thought process because the only conclusion i can draw is that they\u2019re using her as a source of income and trapping her into permanent childcare", "i just think on the parents\u2019 part, since they don\u2019t have the worry about paying into the house it\u2019s a weird flex. when i lived at home i helped my mom pay the mortgage because both of us were struggling with finances. it was all out on the table. i was essentially paying for a house that will be left to me so it wasn\u2019t just a necessary expense, it was an investment. i think both sides of the table, if they\u2019re talking about a financial increase, need to figure out the logistics of it as if they do have a roommate. OP said that they wouldn\u2019t even have a tenant replacing her so economically it would impact them if she left and they\u2019d be out childcare. if property tax (i forget the UK term for it) has skyrocketed and cost of living has made their budget tighten, they should be honest about that. if they want OP to leave, they should be honest about that too.  she is saving them the cost of childcare and more than covering groceries, covering bills. they stand to financially lose (on paper) so if OP isn\u2019t told what\u2019s driving the increase it could at least impact their relationship. there are a lot of people saying they might be trying to push her out of the nest but considering how much it costs to move and secure a new place, taking more money from OP is counter intuitive to that process. there\u2019s nothing keeping them from being up front about their thought process. finances are so often what break families and they wouldn\u2019t even have the place if it weren\u2019t inherited already\u2014meaning they benefited from a parent and are using their child as a source of income\u2014and so many people don\u2019t have that luxury. i can see charging the market value if they were still paying it off, but in this scenario i\u2019m confused and if it has a reasonable explanation they should spare OP the ambiguity if they see her as their child and not a customer.", "for what amounts to a room with childcare responsibilities? nope. OP isn't sharing a flat with a roommate- $990 is RIDICULOUS.", "Why do you feel entitled to know their finances?  It's none of your business!  Do they have a log in for your bank account?  Do they get to pass judgement on how you budget, and veto expenses they don't agree with?", ">when i lived at home i helped my mom pay the mortgage because both of us were struggling with finances. it was all out on the table.\n\nThat doesn't seem to be the situation op is in. Her parents own the home outright. They don't seem to actually need op's money, and the childcare you mention is just walking her siblings to school, they may be aging out of needing that and if not, it's not like that's worth hundreds of dollars a week. And just because your mom was open with you about finances, not everyone is, I'd even argue that most people are not. I won't discuss my financial situation with anyone but my accountant and my wife. My grandparents would start an argument with anyone who had the audacity to ask them about their money. I don't think I could ask any of my friends about their bank balance and I definitely wouldn't tell my stepdaughter or grandkids.\n\n>i think both sides of the table, if they\u2019re talking about a financial increase, need to figure out the logistics of it as if they do have a roommate.\n\nBut they don't have a roommate, they have a tenant, and while a landlord might give reasons for a rent increase, they aren't required to, and a tenant definitely doesn't have the right to demand a reason.\n\n>OP said that they wouldn\u2019t even have a tenant replacing her so economically it would impact them if she left and they\u2019d be out childcare.\n\nThey'd be out someone to supervise a walk to school, which at some point won't be needed anyway. And there are two options here: either they don't need the extra money and don't care about the impact, or they do, and they need this increase. Either way, while an explanation might be nice, it's not in any way owed to op.\n\n>if property tax (i forget the UK term for it) has skyrocketed and cost of living has made their budget tighten, they should be honest about that.\n\nNo, they shouldn't, that's the entitlement I'm talking about. Op has no right to know about their private finances. It is none of op's business if they don't want to explain. Whatever the reason is, they've decided to keep it to themselves, and that is entirely their right.  Like I said earlier, some people just don't talk about money, and ops parents shouldn't have to justify themselves about how much they want to charge for someone to live in their space.\n\n>if they want OP to leave, they should be honest about that too.\n\nThis is the one thing you've said here that I fully agree with.  If the rent increase is an attempt to push op out, they should just be honest instead. But, maybe this part changes that:\n\n> if OP isn\u2019t told what\u2019s driving the increase it could at least impact their relationship.\n\nMaybe saying \"We just want you out of our house\" would damage their relationship more than trying to do it this way.  Op has pointed out in comments that they've been looking for places but don't want to take on a roommate because they are afraid they have different lifestyles or levels of cleanliness. It sounds to me like op might be a bit hard to live with themselves, and maybe the parents are tired of it.  Op's other comments make it seem like they are never leaving because they are looking for something perfect at around the same price they are paying now and it's just never going to happen. Her parents might just be trying to make this arrangement less perfect, so that op might put up with some of the things every other person deals with when they first move out.\n\n>in this scenario i\u2019m confused and if it has a reasonable explanation they should spare OP the ambiguity if they see her as their child and not a customer.\n\nMaybe, but the reason why I say op is the A here is that she has absolutely no right to demand that, and it's entitled to even expect it, much less simply refuse to pay unless they give her an acceptable explanation.", "So.

It might not be a very nice way to approach it, but unless there is some other reason they are suddenly hurting for money, better start hunting for a new place.", "NTA but that sucks. I would try to move out as quickly as possible and find a place to share rent with. Not great but I think it would create more stress for your folks when they see just how much you contributed to the home and siblings. The rental market is the real A H here. Same in the USA as it is for the UK. \n\nGood luck", "NTA, and to all the people saying OP should just suck it up and move in with anyone, I wonder of you're the same ones who, in AITA posts about conflicts with roommates, tell the person to just move? Because that's the \"easy\" solution, right? Rent aside, there's still a huge financial and labor cost to the actual moving process, not to mention security deposits, the time spent finding a place, interviewing with potential roommates...\n\nYou're telling OP to leave an imperfect, yet stable, situation in order to roll the dice with people they already don't get along with well. Is this really a rite of passage everyone needs to undergo? To be forced into close quarters with total strangers with whom you have nothing in common? Is home being a safe space a luxury that nobody can afford anymore?\n\nThe assholes are the landlords and legislators and financial institutions who have manufactured the housing crisis, of course. The parents aren't assholes for wanting their home to themselves, if that's what their angling for, but they're adults who should communicate that directly.

At $900 a month plus utilities, you are most likely saving way less compared to renting a room somewhere with someone. If anything, sit them down and fully talk about expenses.

You need to be okay with that, but  still you're already harbouring resentment towards them, I honestly think it would be better to get out with some people, even if you have to take a risk living with people you don't know well. I just think it's better to leave now, it's a horrible living environment when parents and their adult children start to resent each other in the house.
