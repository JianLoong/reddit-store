I was disappointed but whatever, i planned to go the next day. later that night i get a call from my 11 year old niece asking why i\u2019m not there yet. Confused i ask to speak to her mom but the mom refused. She took it upon herself to tell all their kids i was coming over to stay the night. i have never done that before. i had to let the kids down and tell them i couldn\u2019t. his wife texted me and said \u201cthanks for nothing\u201d. Then went on to create a facebook post thanking everyone who \u201chelped\u201d her but just happened to leave me out of the post. petty. so fast forward a week. my brother is released and sent home. 3 days after he was sent home he realizes that hmmm so pain pills are missing. his oxycontin and gabapentin. he confronts her. she said she sold it to ____. he confronts this person and obviously confirmed that his wife was lying. she went through his entire supply in 4 days. he couldn\u2019t prove this so she went to in patient rehab. i took every friday off work to watch the kids cause he couldn\u2019t find short notice childcare. this also happened to be his birthday week. i planned a party and cleaned his whole house. fast forward again. she comes home. she tells him she doesn\u2019t want me to come see them. whatever, maybe she\u2019s embarrassed right. \nthe last straw: two weeks ago i go see them on a sunday. his wife walks past me, ignores me, and talks to my mom. so i go talk to my brother. after a while i start goofing around with the kids in the yard. wife is included. i\u2019m nice, i interact with her and my brother together. i leave. last week, my mom went to visit alone. my brother tells her he\u2019s ignoring me. i literally had no idea. his reasoning? i was disrespectful and ignored his wife. he didn\u2019t even call me or anything to see what happened. he just blindly took her word even though he saw me play in the yard with her. i just feel like i do so much for them and all they wanted was free childcare. so would i be the asshole if i cut them off?", "created_utc": 1683779988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ed4v3/aita_for_cutting_my_brother_off_over_his_wifes/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's understandable that you're considering cutting off your brother and his wife given the repeated conflicts and disrespect you've experienced. You have gone above and beyond to support them, including taking time off work and providing childcare. Their behavior, especially his wife's actions and lies about the missing medication, is concerning and shows a lack of appreciation for your efforts. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries when faced with such toxicity. Just as one might choose not to attend a barbecue where the food is consistently undercooked and the atmosphere is unpleasant, it's reasonable to distance yourself from a situation that consistently brings negativity and disrespect into your life.
