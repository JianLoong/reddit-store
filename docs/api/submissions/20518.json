So tonight I (34m) was playing cards with some of my buddies and it was around 11 pm. I told my gf (34F) that I would come over to her house after I went home to let my dog out and we finished playing. I told her it would probably be around 1 AM. Around 11:20 she messaged me saying that she thought someone was inside of her apartment. I then picked up my phone and called her and the call went to voicemail and this was around 45 seconds after she messaged me. I tried to call her several more times and again all straight to voicemail. I also tried texting her but none were going through. After 5 minutes of no response I called the police and asked for a welfare check because I was worried about her well being and her not answering. I\u2019m not usually like that but the urgency of the text and the lack of contact afterwards worried me. She finally responds after 20 minutes and is mad that I called the cops on her because she had mmj in the house and we are not in a legal state and it could affect her career. When she contacted me I contacted the dispatch to let them know I made contact and that she was safe but the police were already on the scene. I was just worried about her and my adrenaline was through the roof. I\u2019m not sure if I panicked too much and should have just let it play out but also didn\u2019t want to live with anything going wrong.

NTA", "I imagine she thought you would rush over there yourself and not think to call the police. NTA", "NTA - I kid you not this currently the best possible outcome. She texted you that, then doesn't respond for 20mins, like WTF you should be the one that's angry.", "NTA!\n\nThat sounds like controlling behavior. Plus, are you Superman? Like you should fly to her place and clear the scene?? No, a grown-ass woman shoulda called the police herself, and instead got a lesson about crying wolf. You did both the right thing and the smart thing.", "NTA. \n\nShe is probably mad because she wanted you to leave and come be with her. But - that\u2019s not a statement one should take in jest; if someone said that to me and then stopped replying, I would go straight into panic mode.", "NTA. 20 minutes!? WTH!? Did she jump in the shower right after sending you that text? Geez. That's unacceptable. Also, she texted instead of calling. I know younger generations are more about messaging but some things require a bit of urgency and an actual phone call would be warranted.", "NTA dumb games get dumb prizes.", "NTA ! Sounds like you are a caring partner, she should be appreciative instead of mad. \n\nTo be honest her reaction doesn\u2019t add up with the potential emergency situation, hell if I though someone was in my appartement I would be the one to call 911, any chance she lied to get you to come home ?", "NTA. You can't just text someone something like that and then cut contact. Imagine if she actually was in danger - you did the right thing. Hopefully, once the adrenaline wears off, she can see that too.", "NTA\n\nYou were worried and she didnt answer", "NTA, her messaging she thought someone was inside her apartment, then lack of response necessitated contacting PD. I would have too!", "NTA, this is how that conversation should\u2019ve went\n\nHer:  You know I have weed in my house, you could\u2019ve gotten me fired!!\n\nYou: So you text me that someone is in your apartment. Don\u2019t pick up after several calls. Don\u2019t respond to my texts and want me to NOT call the cops?\n\nDepending on her answer would\u2019ve given you everything you need to know about what her intentions were", "NTA. \n\nI would have also called the police, but I would have done it a lot earlier. Your timeline goes she calls you about someone potentially being in her house, then you try calling her and it goes to voicemail, you try texting her to no response, and finally you called 911 for a welfare check. You did everything good and there is an argument that you should have called **earlier** as well.", ">Around 11:20 she messaged me saying that she thought someone was inside of her apartment. I then picked up my phone and called her and the call went to voicemail and this was around 45 seconds after she messaged me.\n\nMmmm...me thinks there was never someone in the house otherwise she would have 1) responded to you when you called to support or 2) told you to confirm there was no one. Also the phone wouldn't have gone to voicemail immediately unless it was either inoperable or off.\n\nSo, my takeaway is that she very likely deliberately sent a message that would light a fire under you to get you home earlier. Yes, I'm assuming, yes I don't know this for certain, but her actions smell shady as fuck.\n\nAll in all you're NTA, because you were concerned and honestly more rationally minded than others would have been when tensions are high. I mean, instead of playing superman and thinking you can zip over and save her from a home invader single handed you called the cops for a welfare check, which is not threatening for your girlfriend. They may be the cops, but this is the kind of thing they do. Her getting mad is either an over reaction to something that is mildly annoying, or it's her being mad over you not giving the response she wanted.\n\nAt any rate, if I'm correct in my suspicions than you've got a girlfriend waving a very manipulative flag in your face. How you deal with that is honestly your choice, but I personally wouldn't have patience for it. Especially, given the fact that you're both in your 30s and too old for that kind of crap.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Her having plants in the house is her own problem.", "NTA That was the sensible thing to do. Imagining not doing that if you GF told you someone broke in and then can\u2019t be reached anymore.", "Nta!!\nShe Said someone *might\u2019ve broken into her Home at night*, and wasn\u2019t answering calls or texts. Even if you had just dropped everything and drove straight there, it could\u2019ve been a dangerous scene you were entering. Calling the cops *was* responsible.\n\nIf she just Said that, and then ghosted you, because she wanted you to come over quicker, she deserves risking get caught with her illegal substances. You *DONT* scare People out of their mind to get your will. \n\nYou did absolutley the right thing, and she played a stupid game, won a stupid prize", "it seems like she was manipulating you into spending time with her", "NTA. But your girlfriend is manipulative.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I hope that someone would do that do me if I sent a message like that and then was immediately uncontactable", "INFO: What was her explanation for the message and the calls then going to voicemail? I think this is pretty critical as your response was reasonable based on the available information.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO - how far were you from home? \n\nBecause if you could have gotten there faster than the cops... yeah, hard to defend being so worried you'd sicc the pigs on her, but not worried enough to go home yourself.", "Gf : come quick, there might be intruders\nOp : *calls police\nGf : *surprise pikachu face\n\nAita for calling cops? Of course not. NTA. She should to let u know shes not going to text u or gonna do something not legal. (She shouldnt do it either way)", "NTA\n\nWhat did she expect you to do after that message? If she thought someone was inside/trying to get inside her apartment her first call should have been to 911. Then she could have called you. Not sent a message, called. If you had rushed to her and encountered someone breaking in what were you supposed to do? \n\nIf her only response to this situation now is being angry because you called the police it is unlikely that she heard someone trying to break in and instead was trying to manipulate you into leaving your plans and seeing her earlier to suit her time frame. \n\nI would ask her some hard questions until she gives you a more honest answer than just anger because she had some weed in her house.  In the meantime you may want to take another look at her past actions regarding you having individual plans that she doesn't like or approve of.", "NTA\n\nBetter no threat in the house, you worried, cops on the scene and in trouble for something minor than an active threat in the house, you shrugging your shoulders and no cops on the scene.\n\nYou did the best you could with the information (and concern!) you had.", "NTA- LMAO! She was playing a game and got caught. She was hoping that you would leave you game and come running to her rescue. It backfired, big time. She showed her hand when she was more worried about getting caught having some weed around than being injured by some intruder.  One of her girlfriends gave her bad advice.", "NTA.  She was trying to manipulate you into dropping your plans and rushing to her.  Maybe you should find a new gf.  This one still needs to grow up.", "NTA you were worried about her", "NTA. Your girlfriend is ungrateful. You don\u2019t text something like that and expect the other person to understand ignore it. Tbh I would be angry at her for scaring you like that. If she feels scared about the drugs, maybe she shouldn\u2019t be dumb enough to have them laying around.", "Nta shes sus af", "NTA. You should think hard about whether this relationship is for you though. What she\u2019s doing is 100% emotional manipulation. She\u2019s only pissed off because you called her bluff instead of rushing over like she wanted.", "NTA", "Nta - she was trying to manipulate you", "Some part of me does slightly feel that way but don\u2019t want to accuse her of it.", "That is exactly what I was thinking. She was jealous or upset that OP was having fun without her and wouldn't come til later so she pulled the damsel in distress play with an audible of not answering text or phone calls.\n\nOP is definitely NTA", "Exactly,someone was feeling a bit annoyed that he was out", "I mean I\u2019m not happy but really I just wanted to know she safe.", "She wouldn\u2019t give me one and kept repeating how mad she was I called.", "Around 25 mins away and I went as I called.", "Has she done something like this before? It is weird she text that and then went silent. I\u2019m glad you called the police - it was the right thing to do. They also wouldn\u2019t search her house on a welfare check so I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s upset about that.", "It's ok. That's why we're here to do it for you. \n\nNTA. I had a break-in last summer. I called the cops, not my husband first. The intruder fled. This is not something to joke about or to play with. FAFO", "It's very clear that's what she was trying to get you to do, dude.\n\nWhy would anyone say \"I think there is someone in my apartment\" and then deliberately not be available to communicate for over 20 minutes if they're fine?", "Sorry should be clear. Best Possible Outcome = What if there was someone in the house, and you didn't call the cops.", "Dude run... she did try to manipulate you, she is smoking the sweet herb, you don't seem happy... get out before you are shackled for 18 yrs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sorry to say it, but this seems super suspiciously like an attempt to manipulate you into leaving your friends and coming to her house. To reiterate, your response was pretty reasonable. I\u2019d say the only criticism is that you waited 5 minutes to call the police instead of doing it the first few times she didn\u2019t answer. I would put a big question mark over this relationship at this point", "Red Flag: dump her because faking a break-in is psychotic", "NTA\n\nI thought you had stayed at the poker night \ud83d\ude06 sorry, my bad!\n\nIf you were that freaked, you did the right thing. Better safe than sorry in these situations!", "He called the cops when she didn't respond in FIVE minutes..... \n\nShe responded after 20 minutes bc the cops had already shown up."]}
