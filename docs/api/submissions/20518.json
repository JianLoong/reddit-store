So tonight I (34m) was playing cards with some of my buddies and it was around 11 pm. I told my gf (34F) that I would come over to her house after I went home to let my dog out and we finished playing. I told her it would probably be around 1 AM. Around 11:20 she messaged me saying that she thought someone was inside of her apartment. I then picked up my phone and called her and the call went to voicemail and this was around 45 seconds after she messaged me. I tried to call her several more times and again all straight to voicemail. I also tried texting her but none were going through. After 5 minutes of no response I called the police and asked for a welfare check because I was worried about her well being and her not answering. I\u2019m not usually like that but the urgency of the text and the lack of contact afterwards worried me. She finally responds after 20 minutes and is mad that I called the cops on her because she had mmj in the house and we are not in a legal state and it could affect her career. When she contacted me I contacted the dispatch to let them know I made contact and that she was safe but the police were already on the scene. I was just worried about her and my adrenaline was through the roof. I\u2019m not sure if I panicked too much and should have just let it play out but also didn\u2019t want to live with anything going wrong.

NTA", "I imagine she thought you would rush over there yourself and not think to call the police. NTA", "NTA - I kid you not this currently the best possible outcome. She texted you that, then doesn't respond for 20mins, like WTF you should be the one that's angry.", "NTA!\n\nThat sounds like controlling behavior. Plus, are you Superman? Like you should fly to her place and clear the scene?? No, a grown-ass woman shoulda called the police herself, and instead got a lesson about crying wolf. You did both the right thing and the smart thing.", "NTA. \n\nShe is probably mad because she wanted you to leave and come be with her. But - that\u2019s not a statement one should take in jest; if someone said that to me and then stopped replying, I would go straight into panic mode.", "NTA. 20 minutes!? WTH!? Did she jump in the shower right after sending you that text? Geez. That's unacceptable. Also, she texted instead of calling. I know younger generations are more about messaging but some things require a bit of urgency and an actual phone call would be warranted.", "NTA dumb games get dumb prizes.", "NTA ! Sounds like you are a caring partner, she should be appreciative instead of mad. \n\nTo be honest her reaction doesn\u2019t add up with the potential emergency situation, hell if I though someone was in my appartement I would be the one to call 911, any chance she lied to get you to come home ?", "NTA. You can't just text someone something like that and then cut contact. Imagine if she actually was in danger - you did the right thing. Hopefully, once the adrenaline wears off, she can see that too.", "NTA\n\nYou were worried and she didnt answer", "NTA, her messaging she thought someone was inside her apartment, then lack of response necessitated contacting PD. I would have too!", "NTA, this is how that conversation should\u2019ve went\n\nHer:  You know I have weed in my house, you could\u2019ve gotten me fired!!\n\nYou: So you text me that someone is in your apartment. Don\u2019t pick up after several calls. Don\u2019t respond to my texts and want me to NOT call the cops?\n\nDepending on her answer would\u2019ve given you everything you need to know about what her intentions were", "NTA. \n\nI would have also called the police, but I would have done it a lot earlier. Your timeline goes she calls you about someone potentially being in her house, then you try calling her and it goes to voicemail, you try texting her to no response, and finally you called 911 for a welfare check. You did everything good and there is an argument that you should have called **earlier** as well.", ">Around 11:20 she messaged me saying that she thought someone was inside of her apartment. I then picked up my phone and called her and the call went to voicemail and this was around 45 seconds after she messaged me.\n\nMmmm...me thinks there was never someone in the house otherwise she would have 1) responded to you when you called to support or 2) told you to confirm there was no one. Also the phone wouldn't have gone to voicemail immediately unless it was either inoperable or off.\n\nSo, my takeaway is that she very likely deliberately sent a message that would light a fire under you to get you home earlier. Yes, I'm assuming, yes I don't know this for certain, but her actions smell shady as fuck.\n\nAll in all you're NTA, because you were concerned and honestly more rationally minded than others would have been when tensions are high. I mean, instead of playing superman and thinking you can zip over and save her from a home invader single handed you called the cops for a welfare check, which is not threatening for your girlfriend. They may be the cops, but this is the kind of thing they do. Her getting mad is either an over reaction to something that is mildly annoying, or it's her being mad over you not giving the response she wanted.\n\nAt any rate, if I'm correct in my suspicions than you've got a girlfriend waving a very manipulative flag in your face. How you deal with that is honestly your choice, but I personally wouldn't have patience for it. Especially, given the fact that you're both in your 30s and too old for that kind of crap.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Her having plants in the house is her own problem.", "NTA That was the sensible thing to do. Imagining not doing that if you GF told you someone broke in and then can\u2019t be reached anymore.", "Nta!!\nShe Said someone *might\u2019ve broken into her Home at night*, and wasn\u2019t answering calls or texts. Even if you had just dropped everything and drove straight there, it could\u2019ve been a dangerous scene you were entering. Calling the cops *was* responsible.\n\nIf she just Said that, and then ghosted you, because she wanted you to come over quicker, she deserves risking get caught with her illegal substances. You *DONT* scare People out of their mind to get your will. \n\nYou did absolutley the right thing, and she played a stupid game, won a stupid prize", "it seems like she was manipulating you into spending time with her", "NTA.

If she thought someone was inside/trying to get inside her apartment her first call should have been to 911. Then she could have called you. Not sent a message, called. If you had rushed to her and encountered someone breaking in what were you supposed to do? \n\nIf her only response to this situation now is being angry because you called the police it is unlikely that she heard someone trying to break in and instead was trying to manipulate you into leaving your plans and seeing her earlier to suit her time frame. \n\nI would ask her some hard questions until she gives you a more honest answer than just anger because she had some weed in her house.  In the meantime you may want to take another look at her past actions regarding you having individual plans that she doesn't like or approve of.", "NTA\n\nBetter no threat in the house, you worried, cops on the scene and in trouble for something minor than an active threat in the house, you shrugging your shoulders and no cops on the scene.\n\nYou did the best you could with the information (and concern!) you had.", "NTA- LMAO! She was playing a game and got caught. She was hoping that you would leave you game and come running to her rescue. It backfired, big time. She showed her hand when she was more worried about getting caught having some weed around than being injured by some intruder.  One of her girlfriends gave her bad advice.", "NTA.

Your girlfriend is ungrateful. You don\u2019t text something like that and expect the other person to understand ignore it. Tbh I would be angry at her for scaring you like that.

Best Possible Outcome = What if there was someone in the house, and you didn't call the cops.", "Dude run... she did try to manipulate you, she is smoking the sweet herb, you don't seem happy... get out before you are shackled for 18 yrs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sorry to say it, but this seems super suspiciously like an attempt to manipulate you into leaving your friends and coming to her house. To reiterate, your response was pretty reasonable.

Faking a break-in is psychotic, and she needs to know how idiotic and transparent her manipulation is in the real world.

Also, that is not really behavior you can really just let go of because it\u2019s hugely manipulative. One time I heard some odd noises in the house and called someone I knew wasn\u2019t busy to stay on the phone with me while I checked it out. It comforted me and if anything did happen someone would know immediately to call the cops. What does texting that to you and then going radio silent accomplish other than worrying you enough to make you want to come over sooner?", "If she doesn't clear the air and apologize once she calms down and thinks rationally and instead tries to argue it's somehow your fault for reacting appropriately to what you thought was a real threat to her safety then you know she's going to continue trying to manipulate you the rest of the relationship and you most definitely should end things, like this stuff is a massive indicator of how she thinks of you and who she is", "Did she ever say anything about why she went radio silent after sending that text?  Like she dropped her phone in the toilet idk or just got mad?  \n\nDoesn't matter for my vote just curious lol -sure NTA", "Oh that is what she was doing", "My ex pulled similar things multiple times. I just told him I called 999 when he wouldn\u2019t respond (I didn\u2019t actually bc I knew his housemate had weed and also worked nights) and he began backtracking. Same the next time.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be pissed.

And if she *was* being manipulative, I bet she won't try that trick again!", "If weed or a pipe was in plain view when they entered or if she had just been smoking it would be a problem.

I might be able to get there fast, but so can the cops and if there's a situation like that you can damn well bet I'll use every tool to save a loved one. What if there's two and they have guns? 'Intruders' ain't shit to play around with, intruder can turn into murderer or worse fast.", "I\u2019m mostly surprised they showed up that quick.", "The thing ive learned recently is to always hide from an intruder or at least not physically approach one. I've strangely heard so so many stories recently of people whose parents have been killed this way - not even wielding a gun. One of them my mom's best friend's father. They hear a noise or hear someone breaking in and go to investigate and get killed instantly. It always was my first instinct too but I guess the wrong one."]}
