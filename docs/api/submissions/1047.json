You're a petty selfish person.", "YTA hopefully he dumps you.", "YTA. Kids come first. They are more important to him (rightfully) than you will ever be. There was an emergency. Emergencies outweigh your goofy little vacation.\n\nHow old are you?", "YTA. He's a parent. His kids are always going to have to come first, especially in an emergency. Live with it or break up with him but don't expect things to change because if he's a good parent they won't.", "YTA. This was an emergency and he was being a great dad. You on the other hand show no sympathy or understanding for anybody involved, so why even bother marrying a man who has children and SHOULD put their needs first? Your precious vacation can be postponed, children are living beings who need parents there for them 24/7 and cannot be put on hold.", "YTA. His children are more important than a vacation. Period. Gotta love a man who has correct priorities. If you have an issue with this then you need to find a guy without children.", "YTA. So selfish.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dating a nice guy who cares about his kids. YTA", "If the roles were reversed what would you have done, you probably cant answer that question because you are not a parent, he is, he stepped up and did the right thing, for everyone involved, he takes care of his kids, you are secondary to that , accept it or move on.\n\nYTA", "yta. it's his kids and he's their dad, he needs to be there incase his kids have an emergency.", "YTA\n\nDoes it suck? Yeah\n\nDoes it happen when you're a parent? Yeah.\n\nWhat exactly did you expect him to do? REFUSE TO TAKE HIS CHILDREN?? \n\nSorry babe, kids are always going to take priority and you should understand that already if you're engaged.  \n\nTry handling these little curveballs with grace instead of temper tantrums.", "What did you expect him to do? He is legally bound to his kids, not,your vacation. Bummer? Yes. But that\u2019s happens when you have the responsibility of children. What did you expect? For his ex to hobble around trying to take care of herself and them? For him to leave then at home alone for 3 days? His compromise of take them or postpone was more than reasonable. YTA", "YTA. Don't get engaged to a man with children, especially young children, if you don't freaking like them. He's a dad before he's your fiancee and his children are always going to come first, especially when mom is unable to care for them. Grow up, OP.", "YTA. He's a parent. Accept it or move on.", "YTA. There was an emergency. His ex-wife couldn\u2019t take care of the kids. Of course he would take his kids. If you can\u2019t handle that emergencies happen, you are not mature enough for marriage.", "YTA\n\nAnd just an observation: sure have been a lot of single parent / unexpected time with kids posts lately.", "YTA. He's a parent, you should have known that something like this could happen. Be gave you two options, you're the one that ruined it", "YTA. You're dating a man with kids. There was an emergency.  His kids have to come first.", "YTFA  an emergency is an emergency. He is a father first and a Fiance second. Let the man be with his kids.", "Respectfully you are not built for this relationship. You are trying to be with a man who automatically makes you a parental figure by default. THERE MOTHER BROKE HER LEG. You try taking care of children with a freshly broken leg. He is parenting his kids and being an awesome dad. He kids come first. Always. You do not and never will. If your not into that life then don\u2019t date a single parent", "Yes. Yes you are.", "YTA. He has kids. He has a responsibility to his kids. His ex broke her leg. Unless you think that she broker her leg on purpose to sabotage your vacation, you can file this one under \"shit happens\".\n\nShe broke her leg, so he took the kids. That all sounds sensible.\n\nYou lost your shit because you're selfish and want to pretend that your fiance doesn't have children.", "Sorry to disappoint you princess but his kids trump you in this situation. The ex broke her leg, she didn't do that on purpose. Your reaction is so entitled and spoiled. \n\nSure you're not a wee bit jealous? YTA. He needs a fiance not a pouting child.", "NTA I understand you are frustrated that you planned and paid for a vacation that I\u2019m sure you were looking forward to, and it got ruined. I don\u2019t think you are a AH for being upset that your plans got ruined. I think you should do yourself a favor and dump him and find a guy without kids.\n\nAlso did the ex plan to just not have the kids the entire duration of her leg being broken? That\u2019s going to take weeks to heal.", "YTA. What you experienced is the reality of the situation \u2014 he has kids and needs to be available if there\u2019s an emergency. What would you have done if these were your kids too, you\u2019d arranged for a sitter for those days, but there was an emergency with the sitter? Same deal. Only the kids probably need his support even more because their other parent is hurt. He is a father. You can\u2019t ask him to not be there for his kids at a time of need just because he has previous plans with you. If you can\u2019t deal with that, don\u2019t get involved with someone who has kids.", "Sorry but YTA. When you have kids plans can change last minute, she broke her leg which makes it hard to care for them but luckily her kids have a good dad willing to take them. If you don't want your plans changed then don't date someone with kids", "YTA, don't date parents.", "I came here to say YTA and had a wonderful explanation ready to go, but all the other comments were very thorough and covered everything. It truly takes a village\u2026.lol", "NTA.", "YTA obviously. You\u2019re engaged to a man with kids. If you have a problem with him putting their well-being first you might want to call the wedding off now.", "YTA. Hope he took the kids on the vacation without her. And then didn't come back!", "NTA I wonder if the ex really had an accident. Why can't anyone else take care of the kids?\n\nMaybe dating someone with kids is not for you.", "YTA for the same reasons as the majority. Seriously is this a joke post?", "YTA!!!!!!!!!!", "  YTA- honestly this is such an ideal divorce situation. The mom gets in an accident and realizes she needs help and asks her ex for help and him just saying yes and taking the kids. That\u2019s what coparenting looks like. If god forbid something happen to his ex would you be prepared to take them full time? Do you think if you decide to have kids you can treat the steps as well as your kid when they are with you? Are you willing to let him be a father to his kids with his ex? I think you should consider this before you marry him.", "YTA - as their dad, it is his responsibility to take care of them and, if he's worth a damn, that will always take precedence over your feelings.  I'm not saying that you will always come second, but your WANTS will (and should) come second to their NEEDS.", "YTA. What exactly did you expect him to do? You\u2019re beyond selfish and don\u2019t have any empathy. This was an emergency.", "NAH, shit happened, he ended up with his kids, instead of on a weekend getaway. You went with a friend and hopefully had a good time. If you\u2019re dating a parent, things won\u2019t always work out. Get used to it or break up.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s an emergency. His kids come first.  \n\nDon\u2019t marry someone who has kids if you don\u2019t want to be around someone\u2019s kids.", "yta....\n\nI don't think you are ready to be with a man that has children... \n\nYou get some leniency when they hit 18 but these are the rules\n\nKids comes first.\nKids come before your spouse, even their parent.\nKids come before vacation.\nKids come before you buying clothes.\nKids come before sleep.\nKids even come before eating for quite a few years.\n\nAny time you think \"he chose his Kids over me you runn up to him and give him a great big hug and say thank you for being a great father even though sometimes I can be a raging selfish child\".", "YTA. This was an emergency situation.", "YTA\n\nHis kids will always come first. And you will always come second. If the mother of his children isn\u2019t able to take care of their kids, because she has a broken leg due to an accident he\u2019s the one taking care of them. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re a parent!\n\nI do understand that this new situation could\u2019ve been disappointing for a second for you. But you could\u2019ve shared your feelings with him instead of losing your temper. He even said you could postpone or still go (with the kids).

Sorry about your weekend plans but his kids needs trump your solo weekend away.  That is what vacation insurance is all about.", "YA\n\nYou are dating someone with kids.\n\nThis happens, and if you date someone with kids you need to get used to this.\nThe ex broke her leg so mobility is an issue for her right now (and so would be taking care of her kids). Understandably, he'd take his kids if she is hurt.\nIt sucks that it happened at this time, not that they call them emergencies for a reason.\n\nYou can be upset at the circumstances and bad luck but he's hardly a jerk or an A H for being the responsible father. \nHe didn't ruin anything on purpose, youshoidl have held your tongue.", "yta.\n\ndont date someone with kids if you dont want them around. its not like his ex dropped them off willy nilly, she was in an accident.\n\nfurthermore, why not just postpone it? if you cant cancel the reservation just make him pay next time.", "Wondering if this is the husband trying to gather some ammunition because this is painfully obtuse. YTA.", "YTA, why would you lose your temper immediately upon seeing them? Evil Stepmother much? They r kids if you love your husband you love them, period. It was an emergency. Your behavior is gross, those poor kids. He should really not be with someone like you.", " Evil Stepmother has entered the chat.  YTA for so many reasons, and I hope unlike most men this man realizes he needs to get you AWAY from his kids", "YTA. His ex had an accident and you can't make room for that?! Your fianc\u00e9 even said that he could postpone the vacation which is maybe better than taking them with you if you wanted a holiday with just the two of you. You're very unreasonable for not accommodating this completely unplanned situation. Did you have this row in front of the kids too? If so, you're something worse than an AH.", "YTA Their mother was injured, she asked him specifically if he could take the children, he did the right thing and said yes. He is their father. His children will always come before a vacation. This is so utterly absurd, how are you so oblivious to why you're the asshole in this situation?! \n\nI get you're disappointed, and you have every right to be disappointed about your vacation, but you are the ultimate asshole for having the audacity to not just be understanding of the situation and then blowing up on him for doing the proper thing. It's not like he volunteered to take them for no reason, THEIR MOTHER WAS IN AN ACCIDENT.\n\nYou could have figured out how to take the kids. You could have tried to reschedule. And if you were unable to move the dates, and the kids couldn't tag along for some reason, you could have had a friend come with instead if that's so important to you.\n\nDon't get married. You are not ready to be married to someone with children, and the children should not be stuck with someone who is not ready to be a decent stepparent.", "YTA. He\u2019s a dad first! His ex had an accident and he needed to be there for his kids, it wasn\u2019t planned.", "YTA You did not say your age. Your being selfish.\nThe woman broke her leg!\nThose are his kids!\nStuff happens.\n\n He's gonna have many many times in life where the kids need him. If your not mature enough to get this, then find a childless man.", "YTA, you are in a relationship with a divorcee who has kids, you should know they will always be priority  #1, and you #2. It is just a fact of life, parents ( unless they are non functional ) will always have unconditional love for kids and care for them. \n\nIt sucks, I feel your pain, but you need to take this as a reality check; I will also add that if he was the type of dad ready to abandon kids \"just\" for a romantic week end, you'd have problems at another level, and bigger ones.", "YTA. If you were my partner and told me I couldn't have my kids in an emergency, it'd be the last day we were together.\n\nI have 50/50 custody but I'm a dad 100% of the time.", "Girl what the fuck, YTA\n\nDad always comes before fiance.", "Is this even up for debate? Yes. YTA.", "Yta. She broke her freaking leg for christs sake. Emergencies happen", "YTA\u2014You got into a relationship with someone who has children. His ex had an emergency and needed him to care for their children. That takes precedence over a vacation. That\u2019s part of parenthood. \n\nI understand that you\u2019re disappointed, but this was a situation that could not be foreseen. If I were your fianc\u00e9, I\u2019d break things off with you for your lack of empathy and concern for your soon to be stepchildren. Their mother was injured and (I\u2019m sure) in pain.

Please don\u2019t date parents in the future.", "YTA, why did you marry a man with children if this is how you're going to react when he has to handle fatherly duties? I can understand some disappointment with the change of plans but to be so enraged when it's something out of his control? You clearly find the children to be a burden to your relationship and sound like an evil stepmother. Don't marry someone with kids if you can't handle it.", "YTA. Please break up with him for the children sake. Someone as self and immature as you are cant be a good step mom.  These kids mom was hurt. It mot like she was out partying. Wow the entitlement if some people. Guess what your poor man has responsibilities. I know it sucks to be an adult. You should try it.", "YTA. This was an emergency situation where their mom was hurt and the other parent rightfully stepped in to co-parent effectively and with minimal disruption. Does this suck for your plans? Yes. Is this a part of being a step parent and in a relationship with someone who has children. Also yes. \n\nFrankly, if the reverse happened and my fianc\u00e9 said no in this situation I would rethink marrying them as that\u2019s not good parenting. He should rethink marrying you since you thought that was an acceptable way to treat his children during an unexpected emergency.", "YTA. I am a bonus mom too and we always always put my bonus daughter\u2019s well-being above ours. \n\nYour vacation can be postponed. It\u2019s not like his ex planned an accident. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a man with children if you can\u2019t put their well being ahead of yours.", "YTA.
