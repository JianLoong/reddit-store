It's bizarre that your parents are insisting that you're the pervert for wanting to maintain some privacy.", "NTA.

No, being naked all the time in front of your kids is not part of French culture (or ANY culture, apart from maybe some isolated primitive tribes) and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with it. \n\nBut you know what IS part of western culture (specifically, a very negative part)? Extreme individualism, in which nobody is expected to care about anyone else, and it\u2019s considered acceptable for parents to disregard their children\u2019s comfort because it\u2019s \u201ctheir house, their rules\u201d.

Nudity is a matter of consent, you are not a young child who won\u2019t notice your parents naked bodies and you\u2019ve told them that it\u2019s bothering you to constantly see them walking around naked. You are their child, they don\u2019t have to always be clothed but wearing a robe or underwear or pjs isn\u2019t hard. They can have naked zones in the house where if you enter then you\u2019re consenting to see nudity. The kitchen doesn\u2019t need to be one of those zones. Bedrooms, bathroom, one of the living spaces, fair enough they can be naked in their own space- but trust me if people are insisting on walking around naked in front of children when the child has stated that they are not comfortable is abusive and gross and you\u2019ve been uncomfortable for years. You\u2019re grown now but you\u2019ve been expressing your issues for some time and they are ignoring you. Consent is key. \n\n\nBottom line: it\u2019s abusive to continue to force someone to see you naked when they\u2019ve told you it\u2019s disturbing to them, even more so when it\u2019s your child. You get no warning of them being naked and they seem like they are deliberately forcing their naked bodies on you because you\u2019ve told them you aren\u2019t comfortable.

Seriously this is not okay. I am not saying CPS should be involved, I am saying how very inappropriate this is around a child who your parents are still legally required to care for while you are in high school ( even if you are 18)", "Exhibitionism will get you on the s*c offender list. Forcing someone to see you naked/witness your fetish is SA, regardless of acts/penetration.", "I dgaf if there is a prepped pit crew outside the bathroom ready to lather, rinse and buff. I would not want anyones bare ass on my furniture.", "Id rather not drape myself in the bug cloth. My face mites are part of my ecosystem. My clothes are not.", "You can be arrested for exposing yourself to people who do not want to see you naked, yes, even inside your house.", "Pretty sure they are referring to it being illegal in the sense of it being child abuse.  Which if the op was a minor still and saying the same thing, it would be and would definitely be a cps call if she told someone at school\n\nYes you can be naked in your own home.  No, you actually can't be naked in front of your minor children IF they are expressing discomfort in seeing your naked body.  It would be considered sexual abuse if OP was a minor and asking them to not walk around naked in shared spaces.\n\nYou aren't allowed to force your child to see you naked if they don't want to.", "It is illegal in front of children.", "No, I totally agree but I guess I'm just annoyed of how french people are perceived and that's what my comment is about.\n\nAnd yes, everyone should be consenting which is clearly not the case here", "Yeah I extremely don't get why they don't just put on a damn robe. I understand this is \\*\\~ who they are \\~\\* or whatever but forcing your kid to look at your naked body every day is not going to make your kid embrace nudity as a lifestyle. I am a parent on the other end of the age spectrum and I've definitely wondered when it's less okay for me to change or bathe with or be naked in front of my kid. My first clue would definitely be the instant they expressed discomfort with it! (I think I'll probably be uncomfortable way before they will). Sure, it's technically \"my house\" but I want my child to feel comfortable, safe and listened to in their house, especially since they have no choice in where they live or who they live with.", "Where? Tell me because I lived in France my whole life and never seen my parents naked in the morning", "I'm French, I know what I'm talking about. And multiple other French people commented the same thing.", "Ffs, I can\u2019t even", "What are you talking about; OP is 18 and legally an adult (both in the US and France). Unless there are other minor children in the house, CPS has nothing to do with it at all - neither does Family Court (it\u2019s called *Child* Protective Services for a reason).", "I understand and I agree too", "Everywhere!", "It's not about the culture of being French. It's about the subculture of being nudist. \n\nSheesh.", "Liar. You would have given examples if what you're saying is true.\nThe only places you can see naked French people are nudists beaches. And nudist beaches are not a French thing", "Yes but that's not the subject here. Most people here say that walking around naked in their house is a French thing. That's why OP put in his post that his parents are French.\n\nSheesh.", "Nudist beaches are very much a french thing. Amd casual nudity around the house is very mucha  european thing. Quit being a prude.", "Jokes and sarcasm are hard to grasp.", "I'm not prude. I just like facts. Like [here](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/best-nude-beaches-world/index.html) you can see countries from all around the world", "Ah yeah, the old classic \"it was a joke you're too dense to understand\".", "Dude france is 9 on that list. \n\nSometimes called the \"Naked City,\" Cap d'Agde Naturist Village is the world's largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season.\n\nLiterally the largest in the world. What.", "It was clearly a joke - they said that everyone they saw in France was naked lol", "And that makes nudist beaches a French thing?"]}
