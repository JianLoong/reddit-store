We are always honest with each other and want the best for one another. Her and her boyfriend Devin have been dating a couple years now and he recently reached out to me about wanting to propose to her. She knows he is going to propose, so it\u2019s not gonna be out of place for me to talk about it bc she just doesn\u2019t know *when* and how he will do it. Anyway, their whole relationship I have kinda gently brought up things I notice about Devin. \nFirst off, he is still married to his previous partner and still has not gotten divorced legally. She excuses this by saying he \u201chasn\u2019t had the money\u201d or \u201cstuff just comes up\u201d but I feel like before you start a new serious relationship you should want your old hang ups to be taken care of. \nHe is also a slob, and Leslie has to make him a \u201clist\u201d of things to clean up around the house. He puts gaming above everything else, and will stay up all night and sleep all day playing video games and this has caused major issues with their relationship and even his job. He is very much a \u201cknow it all\u201d and cannot handle being wrong or not being the best at something, which is concerning to me because I wonder how he acts when she brings up her feelings about stuff to him. \nAnother thing about my best friend is she is a bigger girl, and I have always loved and accepted her no matter what. Before they got together, she wanted to lose weight and be healthy and would often talk to me about wanting to work out with me and eat better. Devin apparently has a fetish for bigger girls and ever since they\u2019ve gotten together she has stopped worrying about wanting to be healthier because \u201cDevin likes big girls\u201d. Like I said, I would love her either way, but I also want to encourage her to be healthier so that SHE feels better about herself and with her life. All of our mutual friends have come to me saying their is just something not right about Devin and I feel like I\u2019m the only one that can talk to her about it before she makes this next step.

YTA for implying that it's unhealthy to be fat and that your friend *should* want to lose weight. This fatphobic attitude has been so thoroughly debunked over the past decade that at this point no one has an excuse for it. The idea that your \"no matter what\" is that you can tolerate her having body fat doesn't exactly betray support or kindness. She probably knows you want her to be thinner, and she's probably using Devin's preferences as a way to avoid uncomfortable conversations with straight-size people in her life who give a shit what her body looks like even though it's absolutely not their business.", "NTA. One of the few times I am wholeheartedly in favor of you getting involved. He is *still* married?? And talking about proposing to your bestie? No way. Not freaking allowed.\n\nShe sounds like she\u2019s love blind and right now is the right (and possibly last) chance you have to pull all your cards as best friend and tell her exactly how you feel. She is close to committing to end game and from everything you\u2019ve said, that might be incredibly detrimental for her.", "NTA, but be very careful how you approach this. Is your friend on reddit? This many thinking it's a bad idea might give her pause. Try sharing it with her.", "NTQ, expressing these concerns to your closest friend is what makes a great friendship.

You sound like a very good friend to have. All of the points you brought up are valid, but they need to be brought up to your friend very tactfully. Someone else said to write what you want to say ahead of your talk with her and this is very good advice. Write what you want to say, think about it, come back to it and make edits. Make sure she knows you are coming from a place of love and concern for her well being. Be sure to keep it about Leslie and Devin and not your personal feelings about their relationship. Start with the fact that he is legally still in a relationship with someone else and this needs to be resolved before he can fully commit to someone else. Also be prepared that she may become super defensive and angry with you for getting involved. \n\nYour friend deserves more than being fetishized by Devin but it seems like she has found validation in him, which may not be very healthy long term. Devin sounds like someone who has a lot of personal issues he needs to work out before he gets into another marriage. I don\u2019t know how old he is but he sounds very immature and irresponsible. One failed marriage, trouble at work and trying to remarry already? If Leslie was my best friend, I would be concerned too.
