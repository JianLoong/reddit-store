Now I love my brother, I do. Although if I'm being honest Tanya is WAY out of his league. She's successful, has two bachelor's and a masters, owns her own five bedroom house, two cars, speaks three languages, and is pretty stylish. I honestly don't know how Dave landed her but proposing was one of the smartest things he could've done.\n\nAfter they got engaged, Dave moved into Tanya's place and in her bedroom closet she has this custom made safe. The only reason I even know about the safe is because Dave told me and a few of his friends about it when we were out at a bar. I would've rode it off as an interesting but unnecessary fact that I didn't need to know. One of Dave's friends however, \"Carl\" (30m) started to subtly probe for more information. Like: \"How big is the safe?\" \"What's in it?\" \"Is it one of those fancy voice activated ones?\" etc.\n\nDave admitted to not knowing and when asked Tanya said that it did have important documentation, some cash, etc. but refused to let him see or give him the passcode. Big mistake confessing that because almost everyone started giving Dave a hard time about Tanya not giving him the code, telling him that since they were going to get married he would be entitled to know, and even helped him come up with strategies to get Tanya to give in and give him the code. I spoke up a couple of times saying this didn't sound like a good idea, but was shut down because I wasn't in a relationship. Fair enough. So I left it alone.\n\nCue the fights between Dave and Tanya about \"lack of trust,\" \"no honesty,\" and \"what if there was...\" Eventually Tanya agreed to give him the code but under the promise that he would only ever go in there if Tanya passed before him. Dave felt like such a big man when he told us how he \"won\" and when he invited us all over to his place (Tanya was out of town), Carl and a few others started giving him a hard time again thinking that he lied about Tanya not giving the passcode and wanted him to prove it.\n\nDave eventually caved to the pressure and took everyone upstairs to open it. I stayed down stairs but I  was told what happened. When Dave opened the safe the only thing that was in there was an a note inside saying that if he ever confronted her (Tanya) about this then the relationship would be over, no room for discussion. Carl and the others ragged on him and Dave kicked them all out while I stayed to help clean up.\n\nDave kept ranting about how hurt and embarrassed he felt and calling Tanya \"manipulative\" and how toxic she was for setting up secret tests. Dave asked me what I thought about it and was shocked when I calmly said he had it coming. He allowed himself to be bullied by his friends to reveal potentially sensitive information and seeing as how this place is in Tanya's name and that she's making him sign a prenup, I wouldn't test my luck if I was him. Dave called me TA am I?\n\nETA: Hey everyone I just got back from work and I'm now checking the comments and since a lot of people have been asking/telling me to tell Tanya I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm currently undecided about that. While I do agree that it was a bad idea for my brother to be baited into betraying Tanya's trust, he's still my brother and unlike Tanya I'd have to stay and deal with the fallout. Although, hopefully she'll either 1) Have hidden camera like some of you are theorizing or 2) One of Dave's \"friends\" will blab and it'll get back to her.", "created_utc": 1691654276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15n5vo4/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_walked_himself/", "score": 3120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tanya was telling the truth and there were just documents, which would mean that the person you are living with and engaged to, from Tanyas perspective, is not trustworthy enough to see documents about themself but is trust worthy to spend your entire life with and live with and even tell them about what is in the safe, knowing he has all the time and availability to break into the safe (which would be absolutely insane to do and therefore would mean you shouldn't be living with that person if that is what you are trying to prevent), so Dave now spends his life aware that the person that he loves doesn't trust him enough for something as insignificant as seeing documents, a piece of paper which just tells him what he already knows, but wasn't allowed to look at.\n\n2.) Dave now aware that his relationship is a lie puts his faith in her and follows through with the promise and then she unfortunately dies, so in his state of grief having lost the person he loved finally goes into the safe and see this shit, further cementing how much of a lie the relationship was. And how the time he originally was untrusting he was correct and now realize his dead partner was a lying manipulator\n\n3.) The current scenario is the most insane, because it was a stupid fucking test, this nutjob (Tanya) made their partner (Dave) think that they didn't have the trust that they deserved to have from their partner so she could fucking test him. You should already be very aware of how much you trust someone if you are going to marry them and have let them move into your own house, but no she decided to make it seem as if there was something important in the safe and that she didn't trust Dave enough to let them just fucking look into the safe, resulting in Dave questioning and arguing that there was not enough trust from Tanya when they have already made major commitments to each other all to find out that he was actually correct to be questioning what was happening as it turned out to be a TEST. A test which seems to be about whether or not he could put up with being kept in the dark by his partner about something as trivial as documents and cash, whether or not he was okay with never being truly trusted, as we all do in healthy relationships with our partners.\n\nThe normal response is Dave asks about the safe, for the first time, you open it there is nothing in the safe and move on. Not lie, make them question the relationship especially as it is progressing into a very important stage, have false arguments with them over the contents of the safe instead of, you know, telling the truth and not lying to your partners face and watch as they feel worse and worse making them feel they are the ones without the trust and the ones going insane when the reality is that Tanya is the psycho and apparently enjoys lying to her fiances face and watching him get more and more hung up over and empty safe.\n\nDave going in and breaking his promise obviously scummy, but is just not as bad as Tanya.", "NTA sounds like Dave is an invasive creep who can't respect boundaries or people in general.", "NTA, he let the three stooges talk him into going in it after promising his fianc\u00e9 he wouldn't.

Important, private documents were likely in there, cash that could\u2019ve been stolen, expensive items and/or sentimental items could have been stolen.

He sounds like a pathetic moron.", "Nah, he broke it because he's an insecure boy who feels like he has prove himself to other boys. If he wasn't so weak, he'd have shrugged told them to kick rocks. He made his own bed.", "Are you lot okay? Did you say Tanya\u2019s your hero for manipulating this guy called Dave? Dave isn\u2019t great for telling all his friends about this safe, but you\u2019re missing the point. Dave wanted multiple opinions about the safe because what in the hell was she hiding in that safe that she couldn\u2019t say. Then she goes and pulls some \u201conly open it incase I pass away\u201d. Who does she think she is, Hannah Baker? Severus Snape?\n\nBecause this lady has a degree and seems amazing Dave shouldn\u2019t be able to hold her to account? Is it not possible that after numerous arguments she moved any sensitive information out of the safe before Dave could see so she could guarantee his loyalty afterwards? In this scenario, she \u201cwins\u201d either way. In my opinion Dave would be the lucky one to escape this doomed relationship. \n\nAnd it\u2019s that initial statement that tells me you did not grasp the situation. \u201cIf Dave had done as he promised\u201d. Granted he never should have made a promise he couldn\u2019t keep, I would go a step further and say he never should have made that promise in the first place. \u201cDo as I say or else.\u201d If he had any sense, he would make his own safe and see if it\u2019s reciprocated the same way.\n\nOP is TA. Have your brothers back.", "And what if inside the safe was documents she was trying to hide? The safe is Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s box. If he doesn\u2019t open it the cat could be dead. If he does, at least he finds out.", "From what I've read, it's not a matter of if, only when.", "Nice try, Carl", "typo sorry", "It ultimately doesn't matter what was in the safe. OP's brother told his fianc\u00e9e he wouldn't open it unless she passed before him; he betrayed her trust by breaking that promise and threw a fit when what was in the safe wasn't what he was expecting.\n\nIf he couldn't trust her not to have anything bad in the safe, then he should've ended the relationship before he betrayed her trust.", "And this kind of preemptively has ruined your relationship with your potential sister-in-law.\n\nBecause if and or when it comes out that you knew what the brother did and didn't tell her, sure, she'd understand because it was your brother.  But she'd also understand she really couldn't trust you too much.", "Still could get her robbed if she doesn\u2019t know he opened it and ever puts valuables in there again without changing the code", "And he doesn\u2019t even feel bad about it! He\u2019s blaming her!", "While all this was going on, Tanya was cleaning out Carl\u2019s valuables.", "NTA\n\nMy God, surely your brother is only old because maturity he forgot to acquire. I totally agree with you, he doesn't deserve Tanya. And I think you should tell her, or give a very heavy sermon to your brother. How a mature man who is about to get married should behave. He's not 15 years old and that was a huge childishness", "NTA. Tanya should know, if she doesn\u2019t already. Your brother seems too immature for her.", "This story sounds familiar to this one. \nAITA for refusing to give my partner the code to my safe?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v9tw6c/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_partner_the_code_to/!", "Oh to have the overconfidence of a solidly average man.", "OP owes it to his brother to secrecy. And is NTA", "This sounds like my wife. I accidentally crossed that boundary by meeting her over social media on Twitter and not meeting her in real life. Real life version of her is terrifying (fiercely intelligent and aggressively assertive) and I would never have imagined she would be interested in me.", "> I would've\n\nwritten\n\n> it off", "He is definitely an immature person and the girl should have the opportunity to know the truth about her boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nPlease be a good person and don't let your brother ruin the life of an amazing woman like Tanya.\n\nFind a way to tell her what happened, even if it's anonymous.\n\nShe needs to call off this wedding.\n\nYour brother doesn't deserve her, and he can't be trusted.", "OP is NTA.  Tell David that he needs to grow-up, he doesn\u2019t deserve her, and that she can find a much better man", "NTA your brother and his friends are super gross though, hope Tanya gets the fuck out of there and dumps his ass, she sounds awesome", "Here's the rub for me: its apparent Tanya has been diplomatic with Dave pertaining to his foolishness to a considerable degree already, especially considering the disparity in their financial standings. I mention this simply because 1) In my experience, women that successful realize their value well and don't compromise readily in what they want from a partner, meaning 2) She must REALLY see worth or potential for such in your brother's character to get far enough to plan out the safe ultimatum. That's basically what that note was saying to Dave: this is the last chance to stop being the kind of guy who would risk a woman like me because you're insecure over the power dynamic. \n\nWith stories like this I'm always reminded of the first drop-dead gorgeous girl I dated and what she told me about her attraction to me that forever alleviated some of my woes from being younger about not being conventionally attractive. I'd say I was nervous because I couldn't convince myself she'd want to be with me when she could have anyone she wanted and she pretty much told me, in a humorously dismissive but somehow reassuring way \"yeah, so that's all the more reason to not be weird about it, I'm with YOU for a reason.\" Ended up going our separate ways but forever thankful for that.\n\nQuick humorous PS for making it through the wall of text: told my boy Larry I worked with at the Waffle House that story one time. Told me: \"Yeah I almost don't wanna believe it but every time I look at you I have to remind myself they make mint chocolate chip for \\*somebody!\\*", "Ok I agree Tanya is a legend, but is she also kind of psycho? Like the hidden note in the safe is next level games. Seems like it\u2019s out of a short story", "NTA, OP. You don't need to tell Tanya. I'm fairly sure she knows all about it by now. It's her decision.", "NTA\n\nTanya sounds amazing! I want to marry her, and I'm a straight woman ha ha. I hope she finds a better boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know if Dave deserves Tanya.", "This is very sad for Tanya - if she finds out, her concerns have been validated.  Dave is an easily manipulated, untrustworthy buffoon who will betray her trust to please his 'boyfriends'.\n\nNot betting on the longevity of this relationship.", "> a lot of people have been asking/telling me to tell Tanya I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm currently undecided about that. While I do agree that it was a bad idea for my brother to be baited into betraying Tanya's trust, he's still my brother and unlike Tanya I'd have to stay and deal with the fallout.\n\nLook, I know you might not want to get too involved. But please do consider letting Tanya know.   Basically it's very clear from what you wrote that Carl, specifically, sounded like he was casing the joint, and now a bunch of people now know (1) she had valuables in the safe and (2) either they might be put back there or she may have other valuables in her house.  I'm not saying that your brothers friends would directly rob her, but they might chat with random people and leak this information out to other people who might.  At least consider addressing it with her from a safety perspective."]}
