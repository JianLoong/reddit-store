Now I love my brother, I do. Although if I'm being honest Tanya is WAY out of his league. She's successful, has two bachelor's and a masters, owns her own five bedroom house, two cars, speaks three languages, and is pretty stylish. I honestly don't know how Dave landed her but proposing was one of the smartest things he could've done. \n\n After they got engaged, Dave moved into Tanya's place and in her bedroom closet she has this custom made safe. The only reason I even know about the safe is because Dave told me and a few of his friends about it when we were out at a bar. I would've rode it off as an interesting but unnecessary fact that I didn't need to know. One of Dave's friends however, \"Carl\" (30m) started to subtly probe for more information. Like: \"How big is the safe?\" \"What's in it?\" \"Is it one of those fancy voice activated ones?\" etc.\n\nDave admitted to not knowing and when asked Tanya said that it did have important documentation, some cash, etc. but refused to let him see or give him the passcode. Big mistake confessing that because almost everyone started giving Dave a hard time about Tanya not giving him the code, telling him that since they were going to get married he would be entitled to know, and even helped him come up with strategies to get Tanya to give in and give him the code. I spoke up a couple of times saying this didn't sound like a good idea, but was shut down because I wasn't in a relationship. Fair enough. So I left it alone. \n\nCue the fights between Dave and Tanya about \"lack of trust,\" \"no honesty,\" and \"what if there was...\" Eventually Tanya agreed to give him the code but under the promise that he would only ever go in there if Tanya passed before him. Dave felt like such a big man when he told us how he \"won\" and when he invited us all over to his place (Tanya was out of town), Carl and a few others started giving him a hard time again thinking that he lied about Tanya not giving the passcode and wanted him to prove it. \n\nDave eventually caved to the pressure and took everyone upstairs to open it. I stayed down stairs but I  was told what happened. When Dave opened the safe the only thing that was in there was an a note inside saying that if he ever confronted her (Tanya) about this then the relationship would be over, no room for discussion. Carl and the others ragged on him and Dave kicked them all out while I stayed to help clean up. \n\nDave kept ranting about how hurt and embarrassed he felt and calling Tanya \"manipulative\" and how toxic she was for setting up secret texts. Dave asked me what I thought about it and was shocked when I calmly said he had it coming. He allowed himself to be bullied by his friends to reveal potentially sensitive information and seeing as how this place is in Tanya's name and that she's making him sign a prenup, I wouldn't test my luck if I was him. Dave called me TA am I?

He betrayed her trust and who knows what would have happened if Tanya had not outsmarted him (although it seems that is easy to do). \n\nIs Dave incredibly attractive? Because it seems that he has nothing else to attract a woman of  Tanya's calibre.", "NTA you're right on all fronts", "I would say that this Dave guy has awful taste in \u201cfriends\u201d, but since he\u2019s blaming Tanya and not himself and his dumbass buddies, he clearly belongs with them.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was probably cameras that saw it all. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised that there was a reason his friend kept asking so many questions. Your brother proved Tanya right. I\u2019m sure even without him telling her anything she probably knows he opened it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re just trying to keep your brother from fucking up a good thing he\u2019s got going on with his lady. Your brothers friends are idiots and your brother is a bigger idiot for listening to them.", "NTA. This made me chuckle. I like this woman.", "NTA. Tanya deserves better and I hope she knows she absolutely does not need to settle for people who can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA what is she doing with your bum of a brother???????? He's giving in to peer pressure on this shit?????? He's a 30yr old child ffs", "NTA. Tanya seems like a smart woman so why is she with a sorry excuse of a man like your brother.", "Tell tnyam. She deserves better.", "Tanya should dump you brother, he\u2019s way too immature to marry her.", "NTA.  Dave is TA.  Tanya trusted him & he broke her trust.  He isn't being very smart.  And he's acting like a child who can't get what he wants.  Now he's hurt & embarrassed?  That's all on him.  He did it to himself & he did have it coming.  It was deserved.  He's also TA for calling Tanya toxic & manipulative.  If he really believes that, then why is he with her?  Your bro is going to screw up the relationship.  Just give it time.  Are there camera's in the house?", "NTA. I think I want to marry Tanya", "NTA. You warned him about his stupidity and he didn\u2019t listen. Then only manipulative and toxic person here is your brother and I hope she dumps him. Please give us an update when she finds out what happened because she will definitely find out and i want to know how it all ends.", "Honestly, it sounds like she needs to drop your idiot brother and find someone with half a brain who isn't going to let his moronic friends push him around.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nWe'd be done. He's far too immature to be married if his friends can wear him down like that. She *knew* he'd betray her.", "NTA. I'm astounded by his immaturity.", "Dave is a tool", "NTA- Dave is apparently easily manipulated and keeps stupid friends.", "Dave\u2019s an idiot, his friends wanted to rob him\n\nNTA", "NTA Dave is a fool to put it nicely. I hope he has redeeming qualities and doesn\u2019t ruin his relationship with his immaturity and insecurities. You tried to warn him but a hard head makes a soft butt as my dad always says.", "NTA\u2026As I was reading the post, I was getting afraid that one of Dave\u2019s friends would break in and steal whatever is in the safe. Glad I was wrong.", "Tell tnyam. She deserves better.", "Dave is lucky that all he is being made to sign is a prenup.\n\nDave needs to grow up - a lot.\n\nHe revealed to all and sundry that she has a safe. How stupid can you get? And then we get to his betrayal and childish behaviour. How weak can you get?\n\nYour advice is sound and NTA.", "I mean yeah Tanya set Dave up but Dave pretty much asked for it.", "ESH. Dave is surrounded by horrible friends, but I mean, you're not all that nice either.\n\n>He allowed himself to be bullied\n\nYour attitude is trash. Can you not see that your brother might be insecure in his relationship and if he is, you and all his horrible friends are probably why?", "ESH\n\n>  Although if I'm being honest Tanya is WAY out of his league.\n\nYou mainly for this.", "Seriously is the sex that good for Tanya to \u201csettle\u201d for this loser??", "[removed]", "[removed]", "IKR?  I aspire to be Tanya!", "that was my take. you don't tell people about security set ups because their secrecy is the first line of defense and the friend asking for more details was clearly thinking of a run on it.", "Heck, I think the friend was planning on grabbing something that day.  He was going to see if he could grab a stack of cash or some jewelry while everyone was distracted.", "I guarantee that the safe logs the times it was opened and she checks periodically. Once she sees he broke his word he\u2019s out on the street.", ">, wh\n\nTerry Pratchett called it \"Jerk Syndrome.\" She is such an amazing woman that any guy with sense would think she's out of their league and not approach, so she starts to think there is an issue with her. So when a guy like Dave, who has demonstrated how he has no sense, asks her out, she says yes.", "Sounds like she is already pulling away. If I left that note in a safe, I would already have made plans to move him out. She Def changed the code just for him to find that stupid note.", "Right?", "Please update. I, and many others are curious what happens next.", "She knows already. What she wants to know now is whether he has the balls to know when he's wrong and apologise knowing it might be it", "Yeah, Carl sounded very suspect with those questions. \ud83e\udd28", "I remember this, thanks for the reminder \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd.", "I hope so, like OP said Tanya is way out of his league and deserves something better.", "hopefully his bags", "This. Not only did he snoop, he brought his shitty friends along. He fully deserves to be out on his ass yesterday (and OP, if I were you I\u2019d consider telling Tanya what he did. That\u2019s an extreme violation, it would be an AH move to let her marry him without knowing).", "This. It\u2019s one thing if he had a little peek on his own \u2014 still a violation of her trust, but if all it was is his own curiosity, just letting him stew in the awareness that he fucked up and now can\u2019t say anything about it would be fair enough. But he\u2019s too naive to be suspicious about his \u201cfriends\u201d bullying him into letting them into her most private personal space just to show off, he\u2019s a massive security risk who WILL get her robbed someday if she lets her guard down for half a second.", "If he's smart, which we take this story at face value he clearly is not, he'd tell her right away and officially apologize and cut his friends off.  \n\nShe will find out and more than likely already knows.", "Oh, he will, he definitely will!", "I'm sure she knows, if this story is true anyway.", "She'll know because he is stupid and will  confront her with what he found in the safe.   \n\nGame over.", "nope, your comprehension is just fine.", "Right? He and all his little buddies sound like middle schoolers.", "> If he's smart, which we take this story at face value he clearly is not \n\nAlas, his friends convinced him to play hooky on the day brains were being handed out.", "I agree that's the smart choice. Even if it potentially means the relationship is over he should legit apologize", "This. He\u2019s an absolute dipshit here and if he has one lick of sense, he\u2019d admit that he let himself be bullied into violating her trust, and be prepared to grovel about making up for it. \n\nBut if she\u2019s smart, not only will she know he not only peeked but showed off the contents of her safe for his friends, but cut him off completely for it. No man that easily manipulated by his ego is worth keeping around.", "Because he isn't supposed to open it unless she passes away. It sounds like the argument that won her over was something like \"but if you die no one will know how to get into it\". So if he confronts her about the note, that means he went into it against her rule for the only time it would be acceptable to go into it. Sounds like she felt he would go in the first chance he got, emptied the contents temporarily (possibly has a separate, better-hidden safe) and left the note in case he did, indeed, go into it. Possibly also has a camera set up to know he got the message.\n\nRegardless, sounds like Dave is easily manipulated and not very smart, and also like there isn't much trust in their relationship. I wouldn't expect this relationship to go the distance."]}
