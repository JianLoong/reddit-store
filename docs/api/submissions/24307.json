{"id": 24307, "submission_id": "15n5vo4", "title": "AITA For Telling My Brother He Walked Himself Into Hole And Having Little Sympathy For Him?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account   \n\n\nI (24m) have a brother \"Dave\" (30m) who is engaged to \"Tanya\" (36f). Now I love my brother, I do. Although if I'm being honest Tanya is WAY out of his league. She's successful, has two bachelor's and a masters, owns her own five bedroom house, two cars, speaks three languages, and is pretty stylish. I honestly don't know how Dave landed her but proposing was one of the smartest things he could've done. \n\n After they got engaged, Dave moved into Tanya's place and in her bedroom closet she has this custom made safe. The only reason I even know about the safe is because Dave told me and a few of his friends about it when we were out at a bar. I would've rode it off as an interesting but unnecessary fact that I didn't need to know. One of Dave's friends however, \"Carl\" (30m) started to subtly probe for more information. Like: \"How big is the safe?\" \"What's in it?\" \"Is it one of those fancy voice activated ones?\" etc.\n\nDave admitted to not knowing and when asked Tanya said that it did have important documentation, some cash, etc. but refused to let him see or give him the passcode. Big mistake confessing that because almost everyone started giving Dave a hard time about Tanya not giving him the code, telling him that since they were going to get married he would be entitled to know, and even helped him come up with strategies to get Tanya to give in and give him the code. I spoke up a couple of times saying this didn't sound like a good idea, but was shut down because I wasn't in a relationship. Fair enough. So I left it alone. \n\nCue the fights between Dave and Tanya about \"lack of trust,\" \"no honesty,\" and \"what if there was...\" Eventually Tanya agreed to give him the code but under the promise that he would only ever go in there if Tanya passed before him. Dave felt like such a big man when he told us how he \"won\" and when he invited us all over to his place (Tanya was out of town), Carl and a few others started giving him a hard time again thinking that he lied about Tanya not giving the passcode and wanted him to prove it. \n\nDave eventually caved to the pressure and took everyone upstairs to open it. I stayed down stairs but I  was told what happened. When Dave opened the safe the only thing that was in there was an a note inside saying that if he ever confronted her (Tanya) about this then the relationship would be over, no room for discussion. Carl and the others ragged on him and Dave kicked them all out while I stayed to help clean up. \n\nDave kept ranting about how hurt and embarrassed he felt and calling Tanya \"manipulative\" and how toxic she was for setting up secret texts. Dave asked me what I thought about it and was shocked when I calmly said he had it coming. He allowed himself to be bullied by his friends to reveal potentially sensitive information and seeing as how this place is in Tanya's name and that she's making him sign a prenup, I wouldn't test my luck if I was him. Dave called me TA am I?

He has a really good thing going and he is going to ruin it due to the jealousy of his friends. People that do what his friends are doing to him aka sabotaging his relationship in a bullying manner do it out of envy. What you need to do is show this thread to your brother and he needs to give a massive apology to her. He needs to get his ego in check and place his trust in his relationship not with his lame friends or he will not have a relationship left. I am shocked she has stayed with the success she has on her own. Maybe point out to him she doesn\u2019t need him she wants him and he is lowering the want by his actions.
