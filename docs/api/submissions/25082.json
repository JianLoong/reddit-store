Probably trying to remember if she has complained\u2026.   Katie should not have jumped into your rent situation.  Not her business, not relevant to the situation.", "YTA. It's odd that you never mentioned it and your mom's reply was actually kinda rude. How the hell was she supposed to know that your mom was visiting and not something being wrong with your apartment?

Anyway, I\u2019d ask things about his life to know more about him, and he would be really short and vague with his answer. I even wondered if his family was a touchy subject to avoid because of it. I communicated with him and he just explained to me that he just doesn\u2019t think to share more than asked but don\u2019t mind talking about them. Anyway, all that to say, this dynamic really made me feel far away from him and not connected to him and included in his life. Also, he needed to go to the hospital at some point and I offer to go with him because in Canada you could be sitting there for 12 hours and I wanted to be there for him but he felt too guilty to ask such a thing of me.

What happens if things end poorly? What happens if she starts dating other people? Even if you were just neighbors that\u2019s a tricky situation. Now add in that your mom owns where she lives? Oof. 3) Do you know how a lot of mothers are about their own sons? Some mothers choose their sons over their own daughters. And a mother who provides housing for her grown son? Red flag. Did she buy the building for you to live in? Huge red flag. 4) speaking of red flags, you say she never asked about where your mom works directly. That feels like your mom/family has come up in conversation, but since she didn\u2019t ask \u201chow does your mom make money?\u201d You felt self not telling her.

I mean I would understand being surprised or maybe a little annoyed but acting distant and cross examining you about your rent is an odd reaction", "I do not get all the Y T As. Definitely NTA. You have dated just a couple of months and you don't live together. You don't have to share everything about you if you don't want to", "Nta. It probably would have came up when she met your parents. The relationship isn't there yet.", "OP has autism", "NTA. I didn\u2019t realize a new partner was entitled to my parents resume/property records or marital status.", "You guys haven\u2019t even been dating that long and you don\u2019t live together or share finances, in my opinion NTA", "NTA - her reactions is.. odd.\n\nWhat does your mother being the landlady charge for her? \n\nWhy does it matter if you\u2019re paying rent? You don\u2019t live together..\n\nI would have a very real conversation about what\u2019s truly at issue here. 4-5 months is still a very reasonable time to have not met family yet, so your mom literally makes no difference. **So what\u2019s her real issue here?**", "I\u2019m probably gonna get down voted for this but NTA. You weren\u2019t intentionally hiding the fact that the landlady is your mom. It never came up in conversation. I find it weird that your gf is so hung up on what her last name is. Like didn\u2019t she already know that from when she rented the apartment. I know I know my landlords fist and last name. And even if she didn\u2019t why does it matter what her last name is? I can understand why she would want to know if anything were to happen with your relationship but for her to get all pissy about it is just weird to me.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't expect to meet my child's dates until they are serious enough for my child to feel comfortable introducing me.    And yeah - I'm sometimes their landlady.\n\nPersonally, unless you introduced Katie as \"This is my gf Katie\" your mom would have no reason to even assume that you two were dating.  \n\nIs Katie having issues with her apartment?    She should be happy that you have an in with management.      \n\nShe may be worried that your mother is going to retaliate against her if you two break up.    I certainly hope neither you or your mom are that person, but that might account for Katie's trepidation.\n\nThis goes both ways.  What do her parents do?  How much do they make? How much do they contribute to her life?    If you aren't at that level of dating, that kind of stuff just isn't part of the conversation.   It isn't lying.  It isn't hiding a child or a spouse.", "NTA\n\nI suspect she wants to live there for free for dating the owner's son and is upset this has never been offered to her.", "You got your red flag quickly good thing. Run for the hills this woman is nuts.", "NTA\n\n50 bucks she asked about how much rent do you pay, cause she thinks she should be getting a discount, those YTA's are insane lol", "NTA", "   )h?& so fuiiuu jixhchhho", "He's trying to hide it from anyone", "NTA. Landlords/ladies don't always come in because there is something wrong, some tenants actually have cordial or friendly relationships with their landlord/ladies. But more to the point, you haad no reason to tell her ithat the landlaydy was your mother, even if your mother had been paying you to stay their, she is the one making this into a problem.", "Esh\nOn one hand it\u2019s weird that you\u2019ve never mentioned your family before. Which might lead her to believe your hiding other things. On another hand I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want someone to know that because it can lead to things like them thinking they deserve special treatment. Her response on if you pay rent is also weird like if she thought you get free rent maybe she should get it as well. But theirs also the power dynamics of something happening if you ever broke up. Overall maybe have a sit down conversation and try to air it out.\nAlso I want to add I don\u2019t think what the mom said was meant to be mean my own parents speak that way sometimes and they never mean it in a rude or harsh way just like we\u2019ll she\u2019s my kid haha funny I thought you knew that kind of way.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly it's a pretty weird you've been dating for 4 months and your parents never came up, but it sounds like an honest mistake. If you're the asshole, so is she for not bringing it up.", "Yikes OP.  Um.  Firstly, you have a weird relationship with your mother.  Second, your mom's attitude is...off.  Third, why WOULDN'T you tell your gf that your mom is her landlady?  That is a potential MINEFIELD of relationship complications, and you've managed to create a brand new mine all your own, that's just exploded in your face, by your ommission.\nYTA.  You have made your relationship weird, and your gf's current home an uncomfortable place to be.", "You're hardly a monster but your girlfriend has a right to be upset with you about this. Think about it from her perspective:\n\nShe has a business relationship with your mother and only knows about that.\n\nWhen you started dating, she also gained a personal relationship with your mother (being her son's significant other). The problem is, she didn't know about this and didn't knowingly agree to that.\n\nA lot of people (myself included) don't like to mix business and personal relationships. It makes things messy and complicated. You've also only been dating for 4 months- what if it ends badly? It's bad enough that you live next door, but your mother also has power over her as her landlord. I'm not saying your mother would ever do that, but that's a messy dynamic for a relationship. \n\nShe should have been made aware of this before she agreed to date you. It's a significant complication in your relationship. \n\nYTA.", "Nta, it just never came up.", "Dating THAT long and you never introduced her to your mom? You lied by omission. You're a huge asshole.", "Maybe going against the grind here, but NTA. You are not obliged to tell everything to your SO outright. Sure, it might be prudent to have a timeline on such things but that doesn't mean you are obliged to spill everything about your parents outright. You should be able to share such bits of information when comfortable to do so. Your girlfriend is wrong on this one.", "I disagree with a lot of people here.  What business is it of your girlfriend as to the relationship with the landlady.  You have been dating 4/5 months, you are not engaged, not married.\n\nWhy does your girlfriend need to know? What right has your girlfriend to know? I suspect that your girlfriend believes she should be entitled to a reduced rent - because the landlady is your mother.  Your girlfriend\u2019s questions seem to indicate that.\n\nTell your girlfriend that you are not the landlord and that you have no rights to dictate to your mother.", "Blown away to see all the y/t/a votes when a thread from a couple weeks ago got n/t/a when the OP *was* the landlord, was pocketing her friends' rent money, and they didn't know she was the landlord before moving in", "NTA - it\u2019s not as if you and your gf have been in a long term relationship. Frankly, at this stage of the game, her questions do not deserve a response because it\u2019s none of her business. This demanding attitude is a warning sign. Sounds like she is already trying to control you. Move on.", "I just took it as a style of writing, certainly nothing sinister.", "I find it odd that he calls her landlady from the get go and idk why I feel that way?\n\nI feel like him and mom don\u2019t really have a relationship and are more like acquaintances", "How have you managed to tell zero stories in the last 1.5 years that would reveal the \"landlady\" was your mom.  It's hella shady that your gf has seen zero photos or heard any stories or conversations revealing your mom and landlady to be one in the same.  YTA.", "I get they aren\u2019t at a phase of taking about nor introducing family, but this is not a normal dynamic. Had she known OP was her landlady\u2019s son she may have chosen to not date you. That whole don\u2019t shit where you sleep thing. So yeah OP YTA for hiding this.", "This. YTA because you just took away her sense of safety in regards to her housing situation when you neglected to tell her you are her landlady\u2019s son. Whether you want to admit it or not, there is a power dynamic at play in your relationship, and you hold the power, while she is helpless.\n\nIt\u2019s generally a pain to find another apartment to move into at short notice, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she dumped you after finding a new apartment.", "NTA\n\nNo, it isn't something he has to disclose, and the gf being pissy about whether or not OP pays rent trumps not saying anything about his mother owning the building.\n\nI feel like if he had revealed the fact before dating, you'd present it as \"you better date me or lose your place\".\n\nFeels more like a generic \"men bad\" comment than any real insight on the issue.", "OP missed a great opportunity to introduce his gf to his mom, even though they already knew each other in a different context. Probably would have made the encounter less uncomfortable.  \n\nYTA OP for being deceitful.", "[removed]", "Katie's definitely not TA, but mom isn't one either.

Witholding that info has forced this girl to mix her financial life with her personal life against her will.  OP is a major AH.", "I agree with you! \n\nThe only things that Katie did that was weird to me, is ask if he was paying rent. I don\u2019t think she would have any reason to be mad that he doesn\u2019t pay rent. However, I would understand why she would ask that if he implied in the past that he was paying rent, so she wanted to know if he was actually lying about that. Which would be fair to want to know if your partner has been not only lying by omission but also going out of his way to lie by saying he was paying rent", "Katie didn\u2019t demand to know what was wrong with OP\u2019s apartment, she was just a bit curious or concern. This isn\u2019t controlling from Katie, it\u2019s just her asking what\u2019s up! \n\nAlso that\u2019s really fucked up that he didn\u2019t say anything to her.
