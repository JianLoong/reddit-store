That day Katie had a day off and happened to see our landlady leaving my apartment. She joined in the conversation and asked what was wrong with my apartment.\r  \n\r  \nI guess she assumed I must\u2019ve called the landlady because something broke? \r  \n\r  \nWell my mom responded with: \u201cDoes she need a reason to visit her son?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nKatie looked a bit shocked and left us alone. But that evening she was more distant than usual, and when I asked what was wrong, she told me to explain why I\u2019ve been lying to her for so long.\r  \n\r  \nI was confused. Then she explained to me that she is angry to find out my mother is also the building\u2019s landlady. And she wanted to know if I really pay rent? What my mom\u2019s last name is?\r  \n\r  \nI told her, i pay rent like everyone else, in fact more. I told her the only advantage i had was not having to pay a premium.

I think the shock came because you kept your mum secret from her", "YTA\nShe has the right to know if she\u2019s dating *her* landlady\u2019s son. She may not have wanted to get involved with you had she known that. If the relationship ends badly, she may fear your mom would make her living situation uncomfortable. Or she just may be uncomfortable with it period. She should\u2019ve been told because it does affect her.", "Yta, your gf knew your mom, as the landlady. You chose not to let your gf know they she already met your mom. Meeting someone parent is a big deal. \n\nShe should had the choice if she felt comfortable enough to date her landlord son. We don\u2019t know your mom if she the type to do something if something happens in your relationship. \n\nPlus you probably broke her trust my withholding information. For I doubt you have never talked about your mom.", "Did your gf need to ask about everyone you mention, \u201cand is that your mother/father/sibling/child?\u201d\n\nBecause that seems to be what you\u2019re implying. \u201cAll she had to do was ask\u201d lol. \n\nYTA", "INFO: what have you shared about your family/mom so far?", "I know that whenever I start dating someone, the very first question I ask is whether their parents own the space I'm renting. Come on!", "ESH.  You\u2019ve been dating Katie for 4-5 months, and the first time she meets your mother, she realizes she is her/ your landlady, awkward.  Probably trying to remember if she has complained\u2026.   Katie should not have jumped into your rent situation.  Not her business, not relevant to the situation.", "YTA. It's odd that you never mentioned it and your mom's reply was actually kinda rude. How the hell was she supposed to know that your mom was visiting and not something being wrong with your apartment? She drew a logical conclusion based on the information she had.", "You're not yet living together, therefore (1) you have no reason yet to discuss finances; and (2) she doesn't need to know why the landlady visited your apartment. Even if the landlady wasn't your mother, why does Katie need to know if something was wrong with your apartment if it wasn't something major that would require you to move out?\n\nAdditionally, from the sound of things you haven't yet introduced each other to your respective parents, or even talked about them much. Presumably the fact that your mother is also the landlady would have come out when you started talking more about your parents.\n\nI understand it's wrong to keep secrets from your significant other, but it simply doesn't sound like you're at the stage you need to share everything, especially not trivial things like if something minor in your apartment needs to be fixed -- and not even the fact that your mother is the landlady.\n\nNTA", "Yta i don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to mention to her that she\u2019s already met your mother. Would it come up naturally? Probably not, bc why would she think to ask you that?? Who asks their partner about where their parents work? You should\u2019ve told her from the beginning bc it affects her living situation.", "YTA. You being her landlady\u2019s son changes the relationship dynamic entirely for her. It\u2019s unfair for her not to know this because it puts an all new pressure on her for the relationship itself, her comfort in her housing, and her relationship with your mother. \n\nAnd more than anything she probably feels like you were lying to her on purpose and for a reason\u2014which is why she jumped to accusations. Why else would her boyfriend not tell her his MOTHER lived in the building! \n\nMeeting the parents is very important to a lot of people in relationships and represents taking the relationship to a more serious/long term level. You took that away from her.", "I also told her that she never asked \"directly where my mom works. And I saw no reason to tell her.\"\n\nYou'd tell her because it would be normal conversation when you're dating. YTA", "NTA I don't see how that information would come up naturally and I don't see why that information would need to come up in the short time you've been dating. I legitimately wouldn't even think to mention that because why would anyone bring that up in conversation other than as a power move which would come off poorly especially if you're not at the meeting family stage in a relationship.   \n  \nI don't know your relationship with your mom but it's telling that you refer to her as landlady more than mom which tells me it's not a great relationship. That's even more so a reason that it never came up in conversation because it's just a business relationship with someone who happens to be a family member.   \n  \nIf you would have brought up the conversation early in the relationship just as a matter of fact she could have come to Reddit and made a post \"The guy I'm seeing is related to my landlord and now I'm afraid I'll get evicted if it doesn't work out\" and people would be freaking out giving her exit strategies.", "I would not say that you are an asshole, but you was weird. This is sort of thing I would expect to come up much sooner in relationship.", "NTA. She clearly hasn\u2019t asked about your parents or you would have told her I guess from your frankness in the post.\n\nIf you want to know people you ask them about themselves and their life\u2019s. \n\nFrankly I\u2019m amazed she\u2019d be dating someone she didn\u2019t even know that much about.", "I'm going to assume that anyone on here that doesn't think that you're the asshole have never been in a relationship. That is some weird stuff. Dating this chick for months and never happened to mention oh yeah my mom's the landlord.", "I\u2019m going with ESH just because of you referring to her as your landlady multiple times and as mom once. It does seem like you\u2019re trying to hide something.\nWhy not just be open if it came up and say hey my mom owns these buildings but I pay rent the same as everyone else. \nThen it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal", "Naah NTA. \n\nKatie doesnt need to know if u pay rent, unless she is offering to pay your rent. Katie needs to learn to read, cos your mom\u2019s last name should be on the lease she signed?\n\nKatie is probably very sad that she had to pay rent for 4-5 months while you dated. You need to date someone else.", "NTA. What does who your mother is or what she does for a living have to do with your relationship?", "GF was embarrassed to be told that by her landlady.  YTA", "Absolutely YTA. I suspect you have free rent and are pretending to be more successful than you are.", "NTA. The fact you never told her basically means it never came up in conversation. True you could have told her. But as you pointed out your GF could have been more curious about your life and asked what your mother did for a living, in which case you probably would have told her. In any case it's a minor thing for her to get all bent out of shape about.", "Nta this isn\u2019t a big deal and I don\u2019t know why your gf cares so much. Why would it come up she\u2019s the land lady.", "NTA\n\nMight be awkward to meet under these circumstances, but no big deal overall.", "NTA. WTF would be the issue if you didn\u2019t pay rent?
