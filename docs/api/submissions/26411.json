{"id": 26411, "submission_id": "16cm0cq", "title": "AITA for telling my dad it's his job to explain stuff to my stepsister and not me?", "selftext": "I have a slightly complicated family dynamic. I'm 16f and I have an older brother who is now 19. My brother and I are full bio siblings. We share the same parents. We lost our mom to fatal disease when we were kids. My brother and my dad's relationship had been bad throughout mom's sickness and when she got too sick to care for us and ended up in a nursing facility, our maternal grandparents took custody of my brother. He wanted to be with them more than dad. It was for the best generally because I feel like the house would have been toxic with them living together.\n\nI continued to have a relationship with my brother. We just didn't live together anymore. My dad didn't want it exactly but he knew that denying my brother access to me could backfire on him. He spoke to a lawyer to decide how much time we would see each other without courts potentially becoming involved or maybe CPS. So I got the bare minimum contact with my brother. Didn't matter because he wasn't able to tear us apart.\n\nI was 7 and my brother was 10 when this arrangement first started. Our mom died 5 months into her time at the facility.\n\nI was 9 when dad met his second wife. She has a daughter the same age as me. My stepsister is okay. But I don't think of her as a sibling really. My brother has zero relationship with her. They have never met to my knowledge and I don't know that they ever will.\n\nMy stepsister has been jealous from the beginning that I have a brother who doesn't want to be her brother too, and that I don't want to be her sister. She has questioned why he doesn't live with us and why we're not both equally treated like his sisters and why he's dad's kid but not living with us. She apparently drove her mom and my dad crazy when I was spending time with my brother and away from them. She'd ask to come most of the time and a few times she even approached my grandma and asked her to take her along.\n\nNow that my brother's an adult and he works and goes to college, our relationship is different. I see him more often because I just decide to go see him and he'll meet me someplace. It bothers my stepsister more now that I'm with my brother more (I also see my grandparents more because of this). But then last weekend things got kinda worse. My brother and his boyfriend had gone to a Nickelodeon amusement park and he brought me back some Avatar The Last Airbender merch. We're both huge fans so it was great. But my stepsister started asking more questions about why he never gives her anything and why he treats her so different. My dad said since I insist on maintaining contact with my brother despite his rejection of \"our other sister\" then I could explain to my stepsister. I retorted that it was his job as the adult to explain things to my stepsister. I also told him that he created this whole mess and he could fix it and he was now pawning it off onto me.\n\nHe said I should speak to him with more respect because he is my father.

Instead, he just sent your brother away when he was just a little kid!

Tell her how her stepdad threw his ten year old son away when his mom was dying and then never tried to regain the relationship when his young son was grieving his mother. Your father even did his best to ruin your relationship with your brother, out of spite as far as I can tell, spite at a pre-teen or young teen.

And honestly, I think your father's behavior throughout this entire narrative is *extremely suspect*. Among other things, I'm wondering why he didn't want to get the law involved to regain custody of his son. He *did* have custody, right? What exactly did he think the courts were going to uncover if he insisted he come home? And why was his response to *keep you from seeing your brother*?\n\nIf you like your stepsister more or less, I *would* suggest you make one last stab at explaining this to her. The explanation is pretty simple: \"You know my brother and father don't get along, and because of that my father abandoned him. That's why he doesn't want to talk to you - because the *only* connection he has with you is that your mom is married to the man who hurt him. And that's just never going to change. I'm sorry you don't like it, but that's just the way it's going to be, and I'm not going to talk about it anymore. If this isn't okay with you, you should talk to your mom about getting a therapist. I can't be your therapist.\"\n\nI only suggest this because what you said is that she's \"okay\", not like you're actually sisters in your hearts, but not like she's terrible and you can't stand her. If you don't want to make this effort, though, then I suggest something simpler: \"I'm not responsible for his choices, and I'm not interested in hearing you complain about them either. Stop trying to put me in the middle. We can watch a movie/do our homework together/make fudge. We can't talk about this. We just can't, and even if we did, nothing would change.\" followed by \"I already said I'm not discussing this. I guess this conversation is over.

Your dad or her mother should have explained things in the beginning, but since they didn't, one of them should explain it now.  Not your problem and you are NTA.

It was stated that she should stand up for herself.  You think that the success is being heard.   The success is in winning her point.

You know that from experience.  Yet you are happy having stated your case without changing anything.  I don't demand anything of anyone.  If my comments sounded like a demand, why are you the only one complaining about it.   IMO it's because you are predisposed to your way of problem solving and haven't the foresight to consider somebody's alternate solution that promotes the chance of winning the argument instead of thinking that the argument itself is the point.
