How is it possible that only one of six young adults in an apartment has a laptop? I don't know where you are but I just looked on Best Buy and they've got a 24-inch smart TV for $70. Surely the people who want a smart TV can come up with that money and leave your private laptop alone.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a weird demand from people who don\u2019t own the laptop. Even if there wasn\u2019t personal information you\u2019re worried about, it doesn\u2019t belong to them. \n\nIf you *wanted* you could make a guest login on your computer for them to use, but I personally don\u2019t lend out my electronics because of the risk of damage. While they may not drop it they could misuse the battery (charging incorrectly), the oils on fingers degrade the paint on keys, general dust, food crumbs, how hard they\u2019re hitting keys can make them stick. Just no. \n\nRoku is cheap and lets you cast from your phone so they can easily do that between 4-5 of them.

I access my banking and credit card accounts through my laptop.  No is no.", "I wouldn't let anyone else into my devices either. NTA. They should grow up, stop complaining, and cast from their own device like you said.", "NTA I can not believe it is 2023, there are six of you in the house and only one of you has a laptop??", "Not giving other people access to your personal devices is just common sense, NTA", "NTA. They can get a Chromecast to watch things, or watch them on their phone. Chromecasts are only $30ish anyway. You do not have to share your laptop, let them be mad.", "NTA - There's no way in hell anyone is getting sole use of my personal devices or access to my passwords. Your roomies are behaving like spoiled children and don't have appropriate boundaries for their behavior. Keep your healthy boundaries and don't let these users hijack your piece of mind. They should all chip in for a used device to accomplish their needs. They're just not that expensive.", "NTA. A laptop is a very personal and important piece of equipment.

Let them buy a chromecast or converter.", "NTA. It's deeply silly to expect someone to give you the password to their computer just to watch movies. You could make a guest account on your computer if you want, though, or just buy a fuckin $30 Chromecast.\n\nOne thing to add: you guys are in this together. Just because *you* are the one with a computer doesn't mean you should not have to contribute to chipping in for a streaming device.

They're lucky you share with them when you're home.  Please don't share your personal computer with them.  It's not about trust, it's about privacy.

You can get in trouble for anything they do while on your laptop....", "NTA - your property, your rules, the end.\n\nDoes it suck for them? Yeah.\n\nDoes that mean you need to compromise your boundaries to accommodate them? Not at all.

You can buy an Amazon fire stick for like $40- they should just do something like that. Having access to your personal laptop is 100% not necessary, and the fact that they think they\u2019re entitled to that is a huge red flag. Do not cave on this. It is NOT OKAY to demand use of someone else\u2019s personal (and expensive) items. Don\u2019t let them bully you into caving- and make sure you can lock your stuff up when you leave the house.
