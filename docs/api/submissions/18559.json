Like getting a second job with that movie time so they have an extra $50 bucks or so.", "NTA \n\n**But get a firestick, roku or any of the other devices used for this purpose**", "NTA, in fact you would be one if you let them use your laptop without you being there. I mean it might get broken and they would have to pay to replace it, or a \"friend\" might come over and get into your banking, etc. It would cost them WAY more than to just buy a dongle.", "Base model roku, fire stick, and chromecast are all around $30. They could pool in on it and it would be less than $10 a person.\n\nNTA", "A Roku is like $20", "Nta, a fire stick is like 30$ max lol", "NTA privacy is sacred. Also they should stop freeloading and contribute to the media used in apartment.", "NTA\n\nThey can't get a Roku or Amazon Fire Stick or something for the TV? It's like $30\n\nYou deserve your privacy", "NTA.  Buy a damn Chromecast with shared funds.  It is YOUR laptop.", "NTA, your stuff, your rules", "Roku", "I bought a used Chromecast for 5 bucks in FB marketplace. Everyone chip in a buck if you want newer model.", "An Amazon Firestick is crazy cheap.", "NTA\nBoundaries NOW. You all are hustling for that tourist money while living in close quarters. Be firm in your boundaries NOW, when roommates want to feel entitled to your personal property at their convenience, but know you can and should take care of YOUR laptop. In a big household as this, you must tuck your things in after use and bring them out for use. \n\nDo not give your bf unlimited access to your things while you aren't there. It will quickly degenerate to your laptop being attached to the TV because he says yes once and never follows up. You need to establish clear and strong boundaries around your personal property in this house.", "Ipads, phone, chromecast, fire stick ect. Plenty of other options. How about read a damn book lol.....NTA", "NTA\n\nFive people, and you're the only one with a laptop? That's unusual.\n\nBut be that as it may, no, they have no rights to your laptop.", "NTA - but now I would be extra careful about where you keep you laptop. Like you said, they should just get a Chromecast. A refurb (or older model) one is like $30", "NTA", "NTA. Tell them to buy a Roku and get over it.", "NTA. Laptops are personal items! It\u2019s totally unacceptable for roommates to expect to use your laptop when you\u2019re not there. Buying a chromecast or a Roku to plug into the tv would be $30. Or they can buy a Chromebook for like $199. \n\nAcceptable: using a roommate\u2019s login to a streaming service (ie Netflix account) on another shared device when the roommate isn\u2019t home. \n\nUnacceptable: using a roommate\u2019s expensive device to watch movies when the roommate isn\u2019t home. \n\nThis is basic common sense and you\u2019re right.", "Yes! I am an AH.  Buy your own stuff.", "NTA but holy shit, just buy a cheap console. You can find a PS4 or Xbox One for $100.", "Can\u2019t one of them use their laptop when yours isn\u2019t available? NTA", "None of them have a laptop?", "They don\u2019t have to buy it because you won\u2019t share. They have to buy it because they don\u2019t own anything that will do what they need done.

See how that works?\nNTA", "NTA \nRokus are cheap. \nOr.. Your friends should do whatever they planned on doing when they packed nothing entertaining.", "NTA. there are options to create a guest profile on mac computers but honestly seeing how they\u2019ve behaved i wouldn\u2019t set it up. i\u2019d also take the laptop with you to work", "NTA. If they need to watch movie try using another laptop. Personally I will not share simply because it contains my financial logins and emails as well as personal messages to my wife.", "Tell them they can login on their phones to the streaming service and download an app to Air-share their shows etc. If they need their shows so bad that they\u2019re bothering you then they need to put in the same amount of work trying to find another way to watch things", "They make HDMI chords that can connect to a smartphone, so not only r ur roommates stupid, they\u2019re also stupid.", "NTA - why don't you guys get an amazon stick or roku?", "How do the 5 other people who live with you not have any kind of console, computer, or 40 bucks for a roku? NTA, and not your fault they didn't understand how to prepare themselves for independence.", "NTA. A Roku is $46 tops. They have options", "NTA\n\nBut, you could set up another account for them to log on to without using your password and getting into your files and receiving your notifications.

You have to wear my underwear while you use it, though\"", "Get a fire stick cheap enough", "NTA don\u2019t share passwords with others. You don\u2019t know who they will pass them on to. Just takes one bad apple.", "NTA. But you could set up a guest user account for them to use. That way they won't be able to see (intentionally or otherwise) any of your stuff you want to keep private.", "NTA, there are so many cheap devices like FireTV or Roku that can stream youtube and shows to a TV and cost less than $50.  If they really want a computer there are cheapo mini PCs that will play streaming videos for less than $200.", "Ok just as a side bar here. NTA but couldn't you just create a guest login if your private information is the concern?", "Buy a $50 firestick plug into the hdmi problem solved", "Password protect it now and put fraud alert on it it will tell you if someone is trying to get into your device without your consent.", "Everyone chip in and buy a Chrome Cast.

Soon they\u2019ll be using it for other things. Which will lead to then wanting to use it when you\u2019re at home too. And suddenly it\u2019ll be your fault for wanting to use your own laptop in your own house and denying them the chance to do xyz. \n\nMake firm boundaries and stick with them.", "Tell them that Roku devices are cheap.  NTA", "NTA but if you were willing to leave the laptop there, could you set up a new profile with shared access, blocking anything you don't want to be shared?", "NTA\n\ni don't like people going through my PC, phone etc. Chromecast is cheap. You can get laptops for dirt cheap as well.", "NTA tell them to go buy a fire tv or chrome stick.  Cheap, effective and not your computer.", "NTA. Tell them they can pool their money together and buy a Roku or Fire Stick for about $30. If they can't afford that, then too bad so sad.", "Firestick, Roku, these are just two examples of hooking up to your TV and you have access to all those things. NTA.

Regularly goes on sale for $20.

What if it gets broken?  They won't pay $35 for a Chrome cast so they aren't going to get you a new laptop.  These people are entitled.  Better watch your other stuff too.", "NTA I always protect my laptop because my cat likes to sleep on it, and I don't want him sending emails by mistake. Seriously, accidents happen. Stick to your plan and don't let them guilt trip you.", "NTA. You need better radar to filter these weird broke moochers out of your life.", "NTA\n\nEwww WTF is wrong with people??? I would stop using it all together now. Everyone is curious about what your hiding, even some people here are rn\u2026.", "Or just buy a Roku box.

Then don't set a password or make it a communal password. You're NTA no matter what, you don't have to allow people to use your property when you're not present.

Or they can buy one of the myriad of devices that can make the TV smart. They aren\u2019t expensive and frankly if they are particularly cheap, I bet they can find an old one for 10 pounds. I see them offered frequently on Freecycle so you could look there too. And if it\u2019s not worth a pint or two to them, then they must not want to watch TV that much..", "Isn't it possible to set up a second profile on your laptop?\n\nGiven how rude they were, you'd still be NTA if you now refuse to do so.", "Yeah of these people aren\u2019t mature enough to figure this out so wouldn\u2019t let them touch my laptop.", "Every single person I know owns a laptop and a desktop and regularly connects them to the tv to use services that the smart tv doesn't provide.\n\nsource: I go outside and interact with other humans *ooooo spooky*", "OP I have discovered that people like this don't respect property they didn't pay for and therefore won't return it in the same condition in which they received it...That is if they actually return it.  That's just another reason you don't give them access.", "Redditors are super out of touch with the general public in this regard.", "Exactly.

They can even take it with them.", "Counter point: the laptop belongs to op and no one else, and everyone else's entertainment isn't op's problem.
