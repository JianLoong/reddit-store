I know this seems like such a small thing but I am talking 5/6 times a day. I used to work from home so I would just go get the ball and ask them to be more careful. However I recently changed jobs and now work out of the house. My partner is still home through the day but is of hard hearing and never hears the kids when they knock, she actually using more sign language than anything or reads lips as she really can't hear well at all without her hearing aid which she only really wears when she's leaving the house. Anyway since I haven't been home to answer the door I found out the kids have actually been lifting my fence panel and coming into my garden to get here balls. I hate this, it makes me feel like my space and privacy is violated. I also have 4 dogs who are using outside when the weather is nice, I have cameras so have caught them doing this ans have evidence but there parents don't seem to care. So I decided the screw all my fence panels in so they could no longer be lifted. Now every night I go home I'm greeting with a bunch of angry kids telling me there ball is in my garden and they can't get it. I just ignore them and throw the ball over without speaking to them. Yesterday when I got home one of the kids mothers was at my front door. When I get out of my car she instantly starting yelling and calling my a theif for not getting her sons ball. I told her I was at work and she started yelling about how my partner could have sorted it, I told her I'd go get the ball so calm down and she said I needed to fix my fence as it was broken ans the kids couldn't get them on there own anymore. I told her it wasn't broken and and I had done that so they couldn't get in. This made her very angry and she started yelling, I told her I couldn't have them letting my dogs out and also mentioned how they almost broke my fence once and she threatened to call the police for theft the next time I don't get the ball immediately.
