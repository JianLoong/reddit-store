This year we got the kids gift baskets filled with self care products, clothing for the infants, and even stuff for their pets. Those I didn\u2019t get anything for were family members that strictly said they didn\u2019t want anything this year even when I asked them directly.\n\nWell, this year I received nothing in return. My SO received a card, a nice jacket, and some chocolates that one of his family members later added was for the both of us, but included a christmas card that was strictly for him alone. While I enjoyed seeing the gifts I brought being enjoyed I couldn\u2019t help but feel left out.\n\nIn years prior, I have received small gifts from them or even a short \u201cSo sorry the budget was tight this year\u201d which I was more than okay with.

That\u2019s where I feel like i may be the AH, because they have kids that they should be spending on and I am technically a stranger in the family. One of them just had a baby too. They have also always been kind and welcoming to me.\n\nI have just recently told my SO how I felt and that while it has NOT stopped me from wanting to get them gifts, that perhaps next year I will just send them with him and not attend myself, as this year I got the feeling that my presence was more or less that of an awkward acquaintance and not someone who has been attending 5 years in a row.\n\nIm feeling really selfish and childish but I can\u2019t help but feel left out by the lack of even an acknowledgment like \u201cthe budget was tight this year\u201d or a small christmas card.

Gift giving is difficult. They may not know what to give you. \n\nNext year, if you decide to go maybe only give the kids something. Gift giving between adults that you aren\u2019t partnered with or a child of is not common.

Is it possible that his family is somehow not aware that you contributed both money and the time of choosing into all of the gifts you bring? Even so, they know you and your boyfriend are together and it's not really not that hard to have gotten (or made) you *something*: small card you mentioned, chocolates given just to you, homemade cookies, a gift card, cozy socks.... \n\nI'm curious as to what you bf's take on this is. Which leads back to who do his family thinks is doing all of the shopping and picking out of their gifts (and also, girl stop doing that, if you even aren't getting any acknowledgment from them)? And why isn't your bf (for all that I can tell) on your side, standing up for you, even in a deliberate handing over of the chocolates and telling everyone they're all yours because you deserve it all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do cards at the most if you feel obliged, and do your own thing next year. What does your partner say about this?", "okay, NTA and time to make your own arrangements. for comparison, I\u2019ve been with my fiance for 8 months now, spending first Christmas with his family. I got as many gifts as he did - smaller ones but nice and thoughtful. I felt welcomed - as it should be. I don\u2019t think they see you as family, more like a tag along friend. I\u2019m sorry, happy holidays and all the best", "I like to think they are well aware that I\u2019m the one in charge of the gifts, one of the kids (early teen) even whispered a thank you in my ear for the self care products and that she knew I was the one that picked them out. I also texted the older members of the family directly asking for their christmas lists and they denied me. So they knew at the very least I was shopping around for them. \n\nHowever, like you said maybe the implication wasn\u2019t strong enough or maybe when they told me not to get them anything they felt that relieved them of the same? Even though they knew I was getting things for their kids.\n\nAlso my SO is pained for me, though he\u2019s not really sure what to do to help. He feels bad it happened and thinks maybe his lack of communication with his family is to blame, though I don\u2019t think he has any blame at all.", "Once i pointed it out to him the next day (today, our culture celebrates gift exchange on the 24th) he felt saddened that it happened and that i felt so sad. He wasn\u2019t sure how to help make me feel better but he offered that if i didn\u2019t want to go next year we can do something else next christmas. Though as he\u2019s always with his family and his mom just left the country (christmas may be the only time he sees her for a while) I told him I wanted him to spend christmas with his family. I believe he declined that idea but i, personally, would feel bad if he held back from seeing his family on my account. Especially because i know what it\u2019s like to have family that doesn\u2019t really get together or have separated lives.", "That is more or less what a friend of mine told me who is related to the family in question, that they are \u201ctough cookies to crack\u201d. I think i misjudged how close I have become to them and how mutual it was.\n\nThanks and happy holidays to you as well.", "I always get couples without kids gifts because I know they're getting all the kids gifts. Just seems polite.\n\nBut overall, it doesn't seem like gift giving was expected from either party so maybe take notice of that next time - get yourself a gift instead or donate to a charity. Maybe just get something for the host.", "still, if you haven\u2019t cracked them after five years and your SO hasn\u2019t clocked that they don\u2019t welcome you, that\u2019s something to consider.", "That\u2019s a good point."]}
