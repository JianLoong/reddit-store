My dad, grandfather, and great grandfather all had the same name as me. For this post I\u2019ll say it\u2019s John. I always wanted to pass my name down but my wife (F50) and I ended up with 2 daughters. Now my oldest daughter 24 is now my son. I had a good relationship with my daughters and nothing has changed. My wife and I and the rest of my family have accepted that this is who he is. \n\nThis is all a relatively new thing for us, so we\u2019ve been calling my son a shortened, more masculine version of his name, but he knew he wanted to change it. Last week he asked me if it would be okay if he took the name John and became the fifth John in line. I was honored and told him absolutely. \n\nI sent a text to my brother, we\u2019ll call him Alex (M38) to tell him about my son\u2019s new name and he was very upset. He called me and told me he and his wife (F32) are trying for kids and would have liked to name their son John. My brother and I had to get over our own issues with me having our father\u2019s name but we\u2019ve moved past that now, or so I thought. I told him he should use John if he wanted to but my son John is John V because he is older and directly in line. I suggested to my brother that he give his future son his own name and he can be Alex II. My brother said it wasn\u2019t fair and my son was probably going to change his mind and go back to being a female so I shouldn\u2019t let him use the name. I objected to this and we got into a bit of a screaming match and I hung up.\n\nNow my son feels guilty and feels like he should choose something else, which breaks my heart. My wife is on my side but doesn\u2019t like that this has caused a riff and wants us to make up. I\u2019ve tried calling my brother this past week and he won\u2019t pick up, but his wife sent me a text asking me to ask John V to reconsider. \n\nAITA for letting my son use the family name when my brother wants to use it?", "created_utc": 1702146630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ejryk/aita_for_letting_my_son_take_the_family_name/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So were his twelve male cousins. Every single one has the same first name. Every single one goes by their second name.\n\nHe thinks it's hilarious, but he's also super proud to be named after his grandfather. And so are all his cousins.", "I don\u2019t think you understand how generations work. \ud83d\ude04 First cousins are of the same generation. But it doesn\u2019t matter - OP\u2019s son still has every right to keep his name.", "> Your son isn't even the same generation as your brother's potential child.\n\nEh, what?", "They would be the same generation", "Well, he could be, if that's what they wanted to call him.  There are conventions around suffixes like that, but it's not like it's against the law to go against them.", "A \u201cson\u201d that can give birth so either way it\u2019ll take the fathers name", "No it won\u2019t he\u2019s only got two daughters", "\"Technical lineage rules\" count for nothing in the US.  Parents can name their kids whatever they want, including suffixes.  Adults can change their name to whatever they want, including suffixes.  OP's son doesn't need permission to name himself John V, he was being courteous.", "That\u2019s what OP said", "What a load of nonsense", "If they have the same first middle and last name but are directly in line they would use Jr and then I, II, III ETC. If you are naming after the grandfather then yes at this point down the line if OP is IV, then the next one is the V here and then the bro's future kid is VI.", "Would he be a second because he's named after his grandfather, not father, hypothetically??", "It\u2019s both", "Totally this exactly.", "The Desistance rate at 24 year old is very small I'm almost sure below 10% for Desistance and detransition", "Strangely enough I know another family that had a George father and did the same thing (George Jr, Georgina, Georgete etc).", "Thank you,  I am aware of how familial generations work.  I'm speaking more about societal generations.  John would be old enough to be this kid's parent.  There shouldn't need to be any sort of conflict or competition on who gets to use the name.  They're far enough separated that it wouldn't be weird for both of them to use it.", "They mean social generation. If the brother and his wife somehow had a child tomorrow there would already be a 24 year age gap between that baby and John V.\n\nGen beta and Gen z", "Plenty of sons are infertile and there is adoption which is allowed", "\u201cIt\u201d is a really gross way to refer to people who haven\u2019t specifically asked you to use that pronoun for them.", "Nope one daughter, one son", "No, because there's already been a second/junior; that's a prerequisite for getting to the point where you have a IV and (potentially) a V.\n\nI mean, technically, OP's brother can name his future child whatever the heck he wants \u2013 he *could* name his son John Senior, though it would seem really weird.", "No. The son is only II or Jr if he has the same exact name as his father.", "As did Michael Jackson.", "I understand exactly what you mean by social generations. There is a decade, and an entire social generational difference between me and my closest sibling. \nI'm a millennial, but grew up with elder millennials and gen-x's. My siblings are as gen-z as you can get. Even though we're (full) siblings, the cultural/generational divide/separation is mind-bogglingly massive.", "The baby would be John VI and it would be fine.", "The poster knows that and did it on purpose, along with putting the word \"son\" in quotes.", "Oh, I thought II and Jr were two different .... I'm blanking on what the numbers after a name are called. Distinctions??? Lol", "Incorrect, Jr and II have different uses.\n\nMy husband is named after his grandfather so he's a II. If he'd been named after his father he'd be a Jr.", "Jr is the second of the name and the son of Sr. You use I and II when there are people in between. My parents didn't want my brother called Jr. So the put II and said the second. My Grandmother would always complain that wasn't grammatically correct.", "OK."]}
