I told my girlfriend I was going to call my credit card company and have the payments stopped. Then my girlfriend could use her credit card and set up a new account linked to her email. (Not an issue. We both pay half with no issues. I would just pay her my half). She said no, that she would google it and see if there's a solution. I told her no, I would like to just cancel and she can set up a new account. She said no again.  \nShe looked it up and found a \"<subscription service> help line\". I told her not to call as it's likely a scam. She said no it's not a scam.  \nShe looks it up and it said it would cost $2 (but refundable). I laughed and told her it's a scam and not to call. How likely would it be that \"yes sir, we know you've paid about $15 per month for years and years...we would like to help you...it will only cost you $2...but it's refundable!!\". I told her a real help line would be free to call.  \nShe ignored me and called the number. They asked for her credit card info. I quickly and loudly told her it's a scam (!!!!) and not to give any information!! She ignored me. I admit they were totally helpful and their advice DID fix the issue. She thanked him and then told me \"see?!, it's fixed!\".  \n10 minutes later she got an email saying her credit card was charged $68 for the call. My immediate natural reaction was to laugh hard at her for a second or two. Well that set her off on me and she was sooooo pissed at me for laughing at her.  \nShe gave me the quiet treatment after that. I don't feel I did anything wrong although I could see why she would be upset about losing out on some needed cash.  \nSo, AITA for laughing at my girlfriend after she got conned out of some cash after I told her she would get scammed out of some cash?", "created_utc": 1685296889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u6u4i/aita_for_laughing_at_my_girlfriend_when_she_got/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something similar happened to my husband early in our marriage.  He gets a cold call from someone offering to refinance the house...he just started blurting out all kinds of private information.  I literally hung the phone up on him and signed him up for a credit monitoring service.  That scam stuff is real and she should probably call and replace the card with a new number because those scams are a gift that keeps on giving.  She needs to learn somehow.", "Normally I'd say yes,  but in this case you were practically begging her not to screw herself over and she just bulldozed on.  Nta. Your gf might be missing a few cards from her deck though op.", "Honestly? NTA. She wanted to show you she knows better. She got scammed. And then gives you the silent treatment for days to make as if you were the bad guy and to avoid the consequences. And I would have a very serious talk with her about that.", "Sounds like a $68 dollar lesson. Sucks for your GF. I hope she knows she needs to cancel that card and get a new one?\n\nMaybe you shouldn\u2019t have laughed. But don\u2019t pay the bill for her. NTA", "Info: why didn't you call the customer service line or chat for the streaming service? Why were you so set on the service being put in her name?", "NTA lmao", "NTA. You told her like 5 times that it was a scam and she chose to ignore you. It's her own fault.", "NTA but why would you need to set up a new account in the first place?  If your service is acting up, you reboot and see if that fixes things or you call customer service. Sounds like your \"pay service\" isn't exactly on the up and up.", "NTA hahahahahaha thanks for sharing. I\u2019m a woman, and I just want to repeat a phrase that my grandmother says every time she see someone acting like your girlfriend \u201cgo mule and get lost\u201d.", "For the first time ever I've seen someone steal a story. My buddy posted this under his account 2 years ago. He's been banned since then. \nTHIS IS A STOLEN STORY!!!", "NTA. She tried her very hardest to get scammed.", "NTA she cant be serious that\u2019s literally what she gets", "NTA lol like you tried to warn here 3 times and she got duped. It is funny and sucks for her but what did she expect? It couldn\u2019t have been more obvious it\u2019s a scam", "ESH - if your \u201csubscription service\u201d stops working, you don\u2019t just cancel and set up a new one, you call up and get it fixed. You were paying for something dodgy, and while your girlfriend was somewhat naive to give up the credit card details, you\u2019re not exactly innocent yourself using this \u201dsubscription service\u201d that has no customer service.", "INFO So the service froze up and instead of just contacting customer service you were going to contact your credit card company and then make her set up a new account with her credit card?  What the what?   Granted your GF basically threw herself under the scam bus-- but still not understanding why you didn't just contact CS for the streaming service?   \n\nWhy were you pushing so hard for a new account on her CC-- and why was she so opposed to that?  Are there issues with you not actually paying your half of expenses?\n\nBottom line YTA for literally delighting in your GF being out $68 and laughing at her.", "ESH, you both have very weird decision making processes and I\u2019m not sure you have room to talk much trash here. You ran into a minor technical issue and decided the quickest and easiest solution was call your credit card company to freeze payments, then set up a new account on a new card? That\u2019s almost as incomprehensible as what she did.", "INFO needed. This isn't a complete story. The jump to canceling the service and putting it on HER credit card makes no sense and needs more explanation. It's not clear why she was looking for a service to \"fix\" that issue. I feel like more details are needed bc something tells me she isn't just angry over being laughed at.", "This can\u2019t be serious. You not only told her more than three time and you keep stopping her but she didn\u2019t listen. Honestly don\u2019t feel bad. Like not at all.

Scammers have purchased look-alike addresses to count on you misspelling the address and ended up with providing them your credentials.\n\nObviously, if you can, setup two-factor authentication for the account.", "NTA, I definitely would have laughed. She put it on her credit card. Call them and just say this charge was never authorized. They will reverse it. Also no streaming service will charge you for basic troubleshooting.  But I'm sure she learned that lesson now.", "NTA.  Gurl should be kicking her own ass and canceling that card.  Not speaking to you for laughing at her hard fought for stupidity (don\u2019t do it!  How many times did you tell her?)\u2026is just messed up.  Like I tell my husband, don\u2019t whine just take the hit.  Lol.  And no there is no violence\u2026.figure of speech.", "NAH but have her call her credit card company and dispute the charge", "First things first she needs to cancel her card and lodge a fraud claim/dispute with the card company to get the transaction reversed.\n\nSecondly, NTA.", "She dug a hole and fell into it. \nNTA.", "Never ever ever under any circumstance ever give out credit card information over the phone. You\u2019re TA for laughing at her and for not communicating rationally and persuasively your understanding of this point. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand your logic that because the service froze the best thing to do is cancel it and start again?", "NTA at all", "NAH.   \n\n\nYou told her she was going to get scammed, she went ahead and got scammed, she is not the AH for getting scammed, that's the scammer. You are not the AH for unfortunately, unavoidably, laughing when the scam punchline dropped.   \n\n\nYWBTA if you don't insist that she changes her credit card details now because the scammer won't stop at sixty-eight dollars.", "I mean it\u2019s insensitive bc she\u2019s probably already embarrassed about it, but you did try to warn her first. I\u2019d say a light ESH bc laughing was insensitive but she basically asked to get scammed by not listening", "No you warned her, she might now listen next time. She probably feels bad enough as it is now, so whilst you are in the right I\u2019d just apologies to smooth it over as it\u2019s not worth the argument", "YTA.  Not for warning her that it was a scam but for seeming to place more importance on being right than on trying to help her feel better.", "[deleted]", "YTA. But\u2026 she deserves it? \n\nThis story confuses my feelings!!! \ud83d\ude02", "YTA\n\nAlso if you don't stop your contact with Netflix or whatever they will carry on requesting payments in line with your contract, this will reduce your credit rating.\n\nHas your gf reported this scam? \n\nIf this scammer has her details it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that she contact the credit card company and the police immediately before worse happens.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
