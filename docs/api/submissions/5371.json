Maybe take that into consideration when deciding whether or not to cook for her for Christmas.", "Roommate is the asshole here. You may be slightly petty, but i feel the pettiness is justified. My only roommate i had understood that i would cook and clean and do a lot of the equal chores around the house, he never once complained about doing all the dishes. Unspoken acts of respect and courtesy go a long way.", "NTA. Give the roommate the choice of either doing the dishes or packing her bags.", "NTA but your roommate might just leave you hanging again.", "NTA. What makes you think you\u2019re roommate is actually going to do something? They clearly weren\u2019t bothered by leaving their mess for someone else. They also didn\u2019t mind leaving all that work for you and your wife. In my mind, you\u2019re either going to have to do those dishes after you eat Christmas dinner or just later. One tip I have is if your wife is the one cooking primarily you can clean dishes as she finishes using them. My dad used to have us do this so the load on whoever was cleaning up after would be lighter", "NTA. But I\u2019d. e telling roommate that if she expects or what\u2019s a great Christmas dinner that your wife is cooking she can most certainly help with the clean up. Info: is anyone else coming for dinner or is it just the 3 of you? Either way, completely rude of roommate to not pitch in!", "NTA you have every right to be upset here. But instead of playing a game, I recommend you confront this head on. You need to tell her clearly that her behavior at thanksgiving was not acceptable and if she cannot commit to doing her fair share, she will not be included in meals. Period. I\u2019m fairly certain she will pull this truck at dinner, you will not clean up, it will become a passing contest and no one will clean the mess. And hopefully your poor wife does not decide to clean because she\u2019s just sick of it.", "NTA. You had an agreement with your roommate and they decided to not follow through, last minute. \n\n It takes so much time and effort to make holiday meals, and for someone to just decide, at dinner, they're not going to help clean up after is just the height of disrespect. Then add on the fact that she couldn't even be bothered to thank your wife, *HER FRIEND*, for spending all day making that meal is just gross. Even if she wasn't feeling well, she could have been appreciative at the very least.\n\n\n(If I'm not cooking, I'll bring Cranberry bundles.

It sends her a message that she needs to contribute something in order to join. I hope you and your wife have a wonderful christmas!", "NTA. However, I suspect that the roommate will pull the same stunt, and then cleaning will be on your wife, which isn't fair to her. If you are going to help with cooking, then maybe wash as you go? I have always done that, and it actually helps as the kitchen is less chaotic.", "I feel like this is also an issue that could've been circumvented..... I've never understood how people can cook and not clean as you go.

Tell her to find somewhere else to have Christmas- that's ridiculous", "ESH (except the wife).\n\nYeah nah. Following your comment, roommate is asshole and needs an eviction notice.\n\nThough the deep cleaning sounds a bit petty, and at the expense of time with your wife.\n\nYou've already explained to roommate that you expect them to do dishes afterwards so there's no surprise there. However, you're going to be tense the entire time, which sounds like a shitty way to spend the day, for you and knowing that your poor wife is not only cooking but doing so while knowing that you're tense all day. Blimey.\n\nGo out for Christmas dinner? \n\nAlternatively - I'm no 'cooking a big meal for three' expert, but surely your wife takes 5 minutes to rest her feet / go to the toilet every now and then? Couldn't she tag you on the way out so you can go in and organise? She could leave the used dishes in one place. You could do a couple each time. Sounds better to me than sitting on the couch in self-righteous mode. Actually I've changed my mind from NTA to ESH (except maybe wife but she might just be trying to please everyone and ideally needs to bash your heads together). JFC poor woman.\n\nRoomy will fight it, there's no winners here, on f'kin _Christmas Day_. Nobody wins in a pettiness competition. Just chalk Thanksgiving up to an example of their behaviour that's led to you asking them to leave. In fact - you've told Roomy your expectations, you can remind them on the day, once. Just expect to do it yourself and be pleasantly surprised if Roomy does it. OMG buy them rubber gloves for a Christmas present!

This is the comment that deserves the praise. \n\nUNSPOKEN ACTS.... if you run out of TP, do you leave an empty roll so someone can't wipe their ass? No you don't. Why? Common courtesy. \nYou see the trash can is full. Do you leave it? No, you change the bag and possibly leave it tied for whomever takes it out at home.\nYour roommate is working midnights but you're home. Do you BLARE your music and TV shows or do you keep it quiet so they can sleep during the day?\n\nIt's all about common courtesy and respect.", "Pretty sure we will.

I'm not happy about it at all.", "Which gives more reason to show the front door and not let to let it kick on the way out.", "The only reason I think she won't pull that stunt is because my wife and I have already put our foot down on the matter. I'm not helping and it's her responsibility because WE ALL pitch in. We already go out of our way so it's the least we can ask. She tried telling my wife she wanted to move out next year and my wife is already happy about it. \n\nI used to believe that and have asked my wife to kindly do that but she refuses or I'm in her way too much. It's a small kitchen. \n\nI like to clean as I go or at least rinse as I go.", "Just the three of us... we don't have any family or the like where we live. \n\nSee, I don't think I should have to say it though. Like when you see a piece of trash on the ground, do you leave it or do you throw it away? Nobody told you to toss it but I bet you did anyways because that's the common courtesy to do.", "Oh I plan to. My wife has said it already and the argument was ugly.\n\nIf my wife ends up cleaning it or I end up cleaning it because it's not taken care of, I'm going to be livid. And that includes putting the food away. She's left leftovers out overnight that usually I would take to work for lunch because I can't leave my workplace. (Complicated)", "Exactly. Everyone contributes. You don't just become a bystander. \n\nFor the most part our roommate does their share around the apartment and usually does dishes when I'm working midnights but this was ridiculous to not assist in anyway.", "Maybe we can look into it? Sadly my wife has already prepared almost all of it in groceries.", "We don't have anyone else coming either.

We wouldn't kick someone out without warning unless things were at a point where there was violence or something radical Iike drugs in our home.  We pay for the roof over their head and they pay only 1/4 what we do because they don't make enough income.", "Because all of us are from out of state away from family.", "So?

But maybe I was raise differently than this friend. If I\u2019m not cooking, then I at least offer to help clear the table and/or clean up the kitchen. It\u2019s common courtesy. If this is more you wife\u2019s friend and your wife is the one you asked that she move in, gave you wife address it with her. Like I said, I\u2019d tell her if she wants ti share Christmas dinner, or any type of big celebratory dinners while she\u2019s living here, she should at least help clean up.", "ahhh of course groceries. I hope you have a very nice christmas dinner however you choose to have it! I feel bad for you and your wife bc it seems like you guys went above and beyond for roommate in the past", "You are being more than generous. You can\u2019t help how your friend reacts, but if you are clear and firm (without being aggressive or rude) you will have done everything you could. It will then be up to your friend if they want to do their fair share or find another place to live.", "How does one do that when she lives there? Lol", "This! No reason to be petty about the dishes, just hand her an eviction notice and move on.", "My wife agrees on this front. Supposedly after moving in with us back in May, they've wanted to leave since the beginning.

Her parents are respectable people. \n\nI do remember an occasion where my wife and I were gone for a week but found our AC was set to like 62 and left on all day. When the bill came back for nearly $200 we were pissed. Told our roommate to pay half because of it. We never run that cold but at night when it is already cold and we set it to 65. \nTheir excuse was \"they didn't know.\" When we told them before we left.", "I struggle with it but chances are I will.

If I need to, I will.", "By opening one\u2019s mouth and telling her \u201cafter your thankless behavior following Thanksgiving dinner, you are not invited to our Christmas dinner.  Neither one of us appreciated you skulking off to your room instead of helping me with the dishes after my wife slaved all day making a lovely dinner for us.  Make other plans, stay in your room, I really don\u2019t care but you are not welcome to join us.\u201d", "She has proven she is able to isolate in her room when not participating, either by her choice or not by choice.", "She sounds like a crappy roommate but that\u2019s just going off what I\u2019m reading here. Does she generally help around the house and with the dishes as agreed usually?", "She does. Though this week she hasn't done them at all. She knows that I work midnights once a month and usually that's the only time I ask her to do them. She knew. But she's left dishes piled for days. The kitchen was awful and yet my wife ended up deep cleaning until 5am because she was so angry. It took her almost four hours to clean it.", "That\u2019s some lazy bullshit honestly. Not sure if her daily schedule and how demanding or not her job is but neither is really an excuse to not pitch in around the house. I\u2019m assuming she pays rent? I think you 3 need to sit down and have a chat about all this, and not just about the holiday dinner dishes topic either, and try to all get in the same page. If she doesn\u2019t have any real consequences for not helping out like she\u2019s suppose to, she\u2019ll continue to put it on you and your wife.", "Ok, I  bet she has no plans to do dishes on Christmas if she can't even do them now."]}
