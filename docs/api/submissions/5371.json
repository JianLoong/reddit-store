We agreed months ago that dinner dishes were a shared task and everyone contributes in our home.\n\nSo when Thanksgiving came around, my wife busted her rear and made a large but elegant dinner for us. She used almost every pot and pan in the kitchen. When we all were done, I took my plate to the kitchen and our \"friend\" stated \"I'm not helping with dinner dishes!\", turned around, and went to her room to not be seen until next day. \n\nNow because I was in the kitchen I didn't hear this statement and thus was faced with a HUGE pile of dinner dishes and food that needed to find homes put away. My wife wanted to watch a movie but I needed to start on dishes or else the house would be messy. I told my wife I didn't expect her to help considering she had been on her feet cooking since 8am. Our roommate had worked a short shift at the grocery store that day so there was no good reason to not help. \n\nI cleaned the kitchen and ended up deep cleaning because our roommate just left without offering any help. She didn't even bother to bring her plate to the kitchen but left it with her other dirty dishes on the table. I was so annoyed. The next morning our roommate said \"I didn't feel good so I went to lay down.\" But didn't even communicate that after Thanksgiving dinner at all. Just got up, said she wasn't helping, and went to bed without even a thank you.\n\nNow with Christmas just a few days away, I'm not touching the dinner dishes. I already told my wife I'm not doing them after the Thanksgiving remark and I'm also not taking my dirty dishes to the kitchen because of what happened on Thanksgiving. \n\nNow before folks go, so what are you contributing on Christmas to dinner if you are not the one cooking? I'm going to make sure I stay busy cleaning and helping my wife cook all day nonstop. \n\nI have already told our roommate and my wife agrees I have every right to be petty in this situation.\n\nUPDATE: So this evening I guess because of all the arguing that happened between my wife last night she had a reality check. Roommate said she's going to do dinner dishes on Christmas. She also said she's planning to move out by June. But now she wants a schedule for when to do dishes.

However, you're going to be tense the entire time, which sounds like a shitty way to spend the day, for you and knowing that your poor wife is not only cooking but doing so while knowing that you're tense all day. Blimey.\n\nGo out for Christmas dinner? \n\nAlternatively - I'm no 'cooking a big meal for three' expert, but surely your wife takes 5 minutes to rest her feet / go to the toilet every now and then? Couldn't she tag you on the way out so you can go in and organise? She could leave the used dishes in one place. You could do a couple each time.

JFC poor woman.\n\nRoomy will fight it, there's no winners here, on f'kin _Christmas Day_. Nobody wins in a pettiness competition. Just chalk Thanksgiving up to an example of their behaviour that's led to you asking them to leave. In fact - you've told Roomy your expectations, you can remind them on the day, once.

Do you like this person? Do you want them as a roommate? You seem to be assuming the worst of them\u2014 you said the next day she said she felt ill, meaning it was theoretically a one time event.

Your wife who just cooked the entire holiday meal?? Your passive aggressiveness honestly does nothing to improve the situation nor does it actually hurt your roommate because either way, they will most likely not do the dishes anyway, but it will most likely create more work for your wife. \n\nMaybe instead of deciding to not do the dishes, tell roommate directly she is not welcome to have any of your christmas dinner unless she helps out with clean up. But even then, you cant really enforce that so it\u2019s more like roommate isn\u2019t welcome to christmas dinner at all.", "NTA, i hope she is paying you enough", "NTA although I'd like to fix it so that your wife doesn't get stuck with any extra work.

Do you actually Need or like your roommate?", "NTA. \n\nBut, I read some of your comments too and I really want to second that you should not let her have Christmas with you, and you need to stop letting her take advantage of you. \n\nStep one is to sit down and talk to her about Thanksgiving. You and your wife should agree on this of course, but tell her that it wasn't okay that she just pushed off the table and walked away, never to be seen again. Given her behavior, you do not want to host her for Christmas dinner, so she needs to find a place to go, or she can stay in her room, but the food you make on Christmas is not for her. If she is very apologetic, or you feel it is late in the game to disinvite her, tell her that she has to agree now to doing the dishes. My guess is she will agree to do the dishes, and then just see what happens. If she doesn't do the dishes after Christmas, then you need to fully cut her off from your help. \n\nWhich leads to step two. Even if she does the dishes, stop driving her around and stop subsidizing her life with food, etc. Tell her she needs to cook and buy groceries for herself and needs to start finding her own rides, since you thought you would be helping her temporarily and teaching her to drive. Since she isn't putting in the effort, you can't keep carting her around. \n\nAnd step 3 is stick to this. You are a young couple just getting started yourselves, and now this woman has eaten your food, kind of ruined your Thanksgiving, is giving you stress about Christmas, and is eating for free and getting rides all the time, which disrupts your day. My guess is this will also have a negative impact on your relationship with your wife, as one or both of you gets frustrated. So stand up for yourselves already.", "NTA- I'm with the other people here, tell her doing all the dishes is an absolute condition of eating the food you and 'chef' do all the work to produce, and if she chooses not to do the dishes she needs to make her own arrangements for food.
