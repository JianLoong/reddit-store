Blimey.\n\nGo out for Christmas dinner? \n\nAlternatively - I'm no 'cooking a big meal for three' expert, but surely your wife takes 5 minutes to rest her feet / go to the toilet every now and then?

Just chalk Thanksgiving up to an example of their behaviour that's led to you asking them to leave. In fact - you've told Roomy your expectations, you can remind them on the day, once.

Do you like this person? Do you want them as a roommate? You seem to be assuming the worst of them\u2014 you said the next day she said she felt ill, meaning it was theoretically a one time event. Why are you assuming she will do it again? Do you trust her? \n\nIs this the first time you\u2019ve come into conflict with her as a roommate?

It clearly didn\u2019t kill you to wash dishes.  Although I do get, it\u2019s the principle of it.   Final judgment: you\u2019re absolutely right you are petty.", "NTA. But you really need to talk to your roommate.", "INFO: did you express your frustration over the lack of help and set expectations for help on Christmas?", "NTA, but it sounds like your roommate's stay has run its course. It would be much better to exclude them from the dinner, or it's likely that your kitchen will be in shambles for days - and thus become much harder to clean in the long-run.  \n\n\nFrom what you write, this roommate basically contributes nothing to the household yet regularly partakes of your resources. Get rid of the freeloader and get a puppy - they're at least grateful, affectionate and adorable.", "This year for Christmas why don\u2019t you give yourself the gift of an eviction notice? \n\nWhy exactly are you providing housing for this leech?", "NTA. I love this so much. Your wife needs to do the same, please.", "If a roommate isnt going to go through such simple steps as: scrapping left over food off their plate and into the trash, then rinsing it off. Why go through such a great production for dinner? \n\nAs a grown adult dealing with another grown adult it is not beneath me to be petty and stack their dirty dishes right in front of their bedroom door.\n\nNTA.\n\nremember to return the favor should she be on the other side.", "NTA\n\nJust cook a meal for you and your wife and tell roommate its tough she can do her own", "I honestly believe YTA here or maybe esh because the dishes would need to be done regardless if your roommate was here or not, and seeing as she has already made it clear she is not reliable or willing to do the dishes after a big holiday meal, who else would be doing the dishes if you don\u2019t do them??? Your wife who just cooked the entire holiday meal?? Your passive aggressiveness honestly does nothing to improve the situation nor does it actually hurt your roommate because either way, they will most likely not do the dishes anyway, but it will most likely create more work for your wife. \n\nMaybe instead of deciding to not do the dishes, tell roommate directly she is not welcome to have any of your christmas dinner unless she helps out with clean up. But even then, you cant really enforce that so it\u2019s more like roommate isn\u2019t welcome to christmas dinner at all.", "NTA, i hope she is paying you enough", "NTA although I'd like to fix it so that your wife doesn't get stuck with any extra work. Why not take your wonderful, talented, hardworking wife out for Christmas dinner instead, and leave the roommate at home?", "NTA. Do you actually Need or like your roommate?", "NTA. \n\nBut, I read some of your comments too and I really want to second that you should not let her have Christmas with you, and you need to stop letting her take advantage of you. \n\nStep one is to sit down and talk to her about Thanksgiving. You and your wife should agree on this of course, but tell her that it wasn't okay that she just pushed off the table and walked away, never to be seen again. Given her behavior, you do not want to host her for Christmas dinner, so she needs to find a place to go, or she can stay in her room, but the food you make on Christmas is not for her. If she is very apologetic, or you feel it is late in the game to disinvite her, tell her that she has to agree now to doing the dishes. My guess is she will agree to do the dishes, and then just see what happens. If she doesn't do the dishes after Christmas, then you need to fully cut her off from your help. \n\nWhich leads to step two. Even if she does the dishes, stop driving her around and stop subsidizing her life with food, etc. Tell her she needs to cook and buy groceries for herself and needs to start finding her own rides, since you thought you would be helping her temporarily and teaching her to drive. Since she isn't putting in the effort, you can't keep carting her around. \n\nAnd step 3 is stick to this. You are a young couple just getting started yourselves, and now this woman has eaten your food, kind of ruined your Thanksgiving, is giving you stress about Christmas, and is eating for free and getting rides all the time, which disrupts your day. My guess is this will also have a negative impact on your relationship with your wife, as one or both of you gets frustrated. So stand up for yourselves already.", "NTA- I'm with the other people here, tell her doing all the dishes is an absolute condition of eating the food you and 'chef' do all the work to produce, and if she chooses not to do the dishes she needs to make her own arrangements for food. Man, when I'm at my parents' for xmas the word I use most is 'next', as in 'they're all peeled/that room's dusted now/that's that lot washed up, what's next?'", "Or maybe telling roommate she needs to find another home.", "This. OP, I would actually ask your roommate if she is going to do the dishes. If not, tell her she's not welcome to Christmas. And also, plan for a day for her to move out. It's clear she doesn't appreciate how kind you were to let her live with you.", "Dinner for two seems the way forward", "Next year doesn\u2019t sound soon enough!", "I think you already have plenty of reason", "She can door dash from McDonald\u2019s", "There are only nine days left in December. But yeah, I'd be counting down too.", "Yeah just tell her, \"Sorry but you aren't invited to Xmas dinner bc you were rude at Thanksgiving.\" Full stop. It's not that difficult.", "Given the disrespect she\u2019s shown you, your wife and the home you opened up to her, I\u2019d suggest you revisit her living with you and invite her to find somewhere else to treat like a restaurant.", "By not cooking for her or setting a place for her and actually telling her she isn't invited to share your food.", "Uh you don\u2019t have to uninvite her directly you could just tell her your wife and you are planning a romantic Christmas meal and ask her about her plans? If she doesn\u2019t make any don\u2019t feel guilty to invite her. I would also offer food only when you are done eating and offer it to her after you are done eating if you feel like it. Also, mention it casually that you and your wife did not feel like cleaning up after a whole ass adult for Christmas so you just wanted a romantic dinner bc thanksgiving was too much.", "Find a restaurant serving dinner and take your wife out. Don't tell your tenant where you're going. Most Chinese restaurants are open on Christmas and many Jewish families go there every December 25th.", "Chocolate covered rage has given you the perfect line to say. The thing is, you absolutely have to speak up because people like this refuse to acknowledge any type of pettiness. She doesn\u2019t see what she did as wrong in anyway. So unless you very directly tell her, she\u2019s going to say that you all are just treating her poorly or excluding her or something \u201cfor no reason\u201d.", "Literally stop feeding her. If she\u2019s not contributing and have the nerve to say she wants other things tell her she\u2019s no longer invited to eat with you both and can have her own separate meal.", "well said!", "Why is this person still in your home. It's simple dishes or find another place to stay", "You don't *have* to play taxi they can walk or take a bus or take a cab", "not including a third party in your relationship\u2019s affairs is the most simple boundary there is. \u201coh this was sort of a date night for the two of us\u201d it\u2019s alarming that you\u2019re worried about their reaction to you not cooking and cleaning up after them. they aren\u2019t your kid and if my roommates did some shit like this story they\u2019d have heard about it before they reached their door to be honest with you."]}
