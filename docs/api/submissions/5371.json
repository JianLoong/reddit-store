However, you're going to be tense the entire time, which sounds like a shitty way to spend the day, for you and knowing that your poor wife is not only cooking but doing so while knowing that you're tense all day. Blimey.\n\nGo out for Christmas dinner? \n\nAlternatively - I'm no 'cooking a big meal for three' expert, but surely your wife takes 5 minutes to rest her feet / go to the toilet every now and then? Couldn't she tag you on the way out so you can go in and organise? She could leave the used dishes in one place. You could do a couple each time.

JFC poor woman.\n\nRoomy will fight it, there's no winners here, on f'kin _Christmas Day_. Nobody wins in a pettiness competition. Just chalk Thanksgiving up to an example of their behaviour that's led to you asking them to leave. In fact - you've told Roomy your expectations, you can remind them on the day, once.

Do you like this person? Do you want them as a roommate? You seem to be assuming the worst of them\u2014 you said the next day she said she felt ill, meaning it was theoretically a one time event. Why are you assuming she will do it again? Do you trust her? \n\nIs this the first time you\u2019ve come into conflict with her as a roommate? If not, how did you resolve the other situations? \n\nWhy not just tell her up front that you would like her to do the dishes for Christmas since she didn\u2019t for thanksgiving?
