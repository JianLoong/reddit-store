You have set your boundaries and she can not dictate how YOU should feel.

It honestly really bugs me thinking about it.", "If she can\u2019t accept your boundary, part ways.", "Yes, that part was reasonable, but then you said \"it was a boundary you wanted to set\". For a naturally affectionate person, that would come off as controlling. I do get your perspective though. It's worth another conversation for sure.", "[deleted]", "Then that's a perfectly reasonable boundary to set, IMO. Maybe wait to discuss further with your gf in person when she's back from her trip and emotions have cooled a bit and you might both have an easier time communicating about this. Otherwise you might just not be compatible.", "Yeah all people aren\u2019t the open and nude beach going type.", "[deleted]", "No choice but to pull a power move. Fly there and kiss her friend to make sure he's gay. 1 up her and use tongue.", "NTA. i have gay friends and i don\u2019t kiss them. it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s no harm, it\u2019s the principle of it. if it was a peck on the cheek or something like that it\u2019s a different story, but full on lip kissing is out of line. i suggest you let her know that her not kissing anyone (gay or not) is a boundary you have and while you will let it go this time, there shouldn\u2019t ever be a next time. don\u2019t let her invalidate your feelings", "Yeah, that's cheating. Doesn't matter how she spins it.\n\nNTA", "IDK. It really depends.  I don't think you are wrong, but I also wonder if you came off accusatory...that might explain why she's so upset and feels like you accused her of cheating with her gay bestie who isn't interested in women at all. \n\n You have a reasonable boundary, but I also feel like this is the sort of thing you talk about in person and not over the phone. I suspect if you two had this conversation face to face, it might have gone differently. \n\nAnd it really depends on the culture or how she was raised. I come from a culture of cheek kissing, pecks on the lips, hugs, etc. I honestly wouldn't think anything of a peck on the mouth, as long as tongue wasn't involved, tbh, especially if it was with someone who wasn't sexually interested at all.", "For me - YTA.\n\nFirst, you \u201cwant\u201d to make this a boundary - not we\u2019ve had a conversation and you did this.  It\u2019s not an obvious in appropriate gesture - I kiss my friends on the lips on the regular! Not passionate kissing, but yeah - a peck on the lips when we say hi or bye is no big deal.\n\nSecond, if it was posted on SM, she\u2019s clearly not trying to hide anything- another sign it\u2019s obviously nothing.  I don\u2019t run to my partner and say, I kissed Ken goodbye today, in case someone tells you - because it\u2019s, literally, not a thing.\n\nThird, to escalate a friend kiss to cheating is some insecure thinking.  Add to that, the friend is gay, and you\u2019re really stretching the definition- especially given the first point above!\n\nFinally, by your own admission, you felt uncomfortable\u2026   Maybe question why.  Is this an ownership thing? Is this a jealousy thing? I don\u2019t think you actually think there\u2019s cheating going on, but when you felt uncomfortable you immediately decided it\u2019s ok to start to put limits and rules in place for her behavior without even considering that maybe you being uncomfortable is a you issue and not a her issue.\n\nYou also sound like a reasonable person, so I hope you both actually communicate and work it out.", "Honestly, the fact that she immediately ran to someone else to bitch about your conversation is a bigger red flag than the silly kiss. \n\nShe should be more open to listening to you about it instead of getting so defensive. It feels awkward to kiss a friend on the lips, but part of that is just our culture. I assume she\u2019s from the same culture, just saying that it\u2019s maybe not a big deal. \n\nNTA. I think you\u2019re well within respectful grounds based on the story you tell about what happened and how you reacted.", "NTA but I don't think your relationship has a future if you have to worry about what she's doing on her own.", "Definitely NTA.  Your girlfriend cheated on you and it doesn't matter if it was just her gay best friend or some random guy.  I'm not saying her intention was nefarious or anything, but you don't go around kissing other people when you're in a committed relationship.  She needs to apologize, it's as simple as that.", "Fell for the gay best friend trick. An old classic.", "No, and you're being gaslit lol. This is cruel behavior toward you, especially how reasonable you seem to be in approaching the topic.", "NTA.  If it wouldn't be ok for you to kiss another woman it shouldn't be ok for her to do it either regardless of the types of genitals the other woman happens to enjoy rubbing against.", "NTA. Lmao if my GF did to at we would break up.", "You can\u2019t change that it happened now, but you can ask her not to do something similar in the future. But don\u2019t push the current situation, because what\u2019s done is done and no one probably knew that it was going to be anything that was going to come up. It\u2019s harmless, while you would have preferred not to happen, now, we can all agree, not to do it in the future.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. Perhaps your gf should be allowed to kiss her gay bestie, if that's a normal part of a long running friendship, but she should have warned you they were physically affectionate before anything got posted to social media. For example, I have known my gay bestie for 11 years longer than my husband. We were college freshman theatre kids together. We fell into a habit of greeting each other by honking each other's boobs. (He's a bigger dude, there are some man boobs involved) This tradition continues over 15 years later. When he came to town and we had a chance to get together and introduce him to my (then) fiancee, the first thing I did was tell my fiancee that he was gonna honk my boobs when we saw each other so he wasn't blindsided by something I found completely platonic but could look a little weird to my actual partner. As a result, my husband was not bothered, and after a couple drinks we had another round of platonic boob honking including my husband in the festivities this time. \n\nMy point is, she should have at least warned you that this is how the two of them interact and given you the chance to get used to it or state a boundary that kissing on the lips is a dealbreaker for you, instead of posting intimate-looking pictures and getting mad that you were upset.", "NTA\n\nPeople that do stuff like this and say it's a joke with no joke being obviously hinted at are lying. The whole thing comes off as the \"gay\" friend is actually bi and she would be with him if she wasn't away from home. Break up and move on dude. It's only gonna get worse.", "Wtf", "You do know that a picture is a moment in time, right? That the actual kiss may have been a second long and not a passionate lover's kiss? \n\nYou overreacted. YTA.", "NTA. He might be gay but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s attracted to men and he\u2019s a man", ">Doesn\u2019t really answer my calls while she\u2019s out with her friends and calls me back towards the end of the day\n  \nGoing with ESH, you have a right to discuss your feelings, and she should be willing to listen, but why are you calling her during the day when you know she\u2019s out with her friends?", "Nta", "NTA. A boundary is a boundary and you have every right to establish it, I don't think you were unreasonable and you didn't accuse her of cheating. If she thinks the comparison to you kissing a lesbian friend is so different from her kissing a male friend that's a bit off but maybe I'm interpreting that reaction incorrectly?\n I'm a straight female with a male partner and I kiss my close, platonic female friends (regardless of sexuality) and my platonic male friends (gay\\pan respectively)on the lips and all my nuclear family. The friend kiss is platonic affection to me, like a hug, BUT I understand that kissing is culturally considered romantic. I had an open discussion with my partner a long time ago about how I show affection to my friends and if he wasn't okay with it I would respect his opinion and we would go from there.\nTry to have another conversation about it when you or she cools down, maybe a peck is more cultural for her or something. That's only my very Sicilian perspective though so take it with a grain of salt; I grew up with it being very normal for cheek and baby lil lip pecks are standard \"Ti voglio bene\" to beloved friends and family.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she can\u2019t have a reasonable conversation about this with you is odd. Instead she\u2019s blowing it up to her friend so he can tell her how wrong you are. \ud83d\udea9", "NTA, although I think it would have been more productive to approach it like \u201cI know it\u2019s no more than platonic, but this is a boundary for me that I\u2019d like to ask you to respect\u201d rather than getting upset. I know plenty of girls who kiss their platonic friends on the lips, whether it be gay men or other straight women. There\u2019s no intention or attraction then it\u2019s not a big deal to some people. While it\u2019s not something I do with my friends, I know it\u2019s not abnormal for some other straight girls so it\u2019s just a boundary that needed to be set, not anything to be mad about if she didn\u2019t know it was a boundary.", "NTA. Kissing someone who\u2019s not your SO and taking pictures of it then posting it, that\u2019s cheating clear as day. His sexuality doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m sorry. She kissed another guy on the lips and the  posted about it on social media. Also if she didn\u2019t have anything to hide or \u201cit wasn\u2019t a big deal\u201d she should told you as soon as it happen. She has failed as a girlfriend. People don\u2019t kiss other people if they\u2019re really love their SO. If she can\u2019t admit what she did wasn\u2019t a smart idea then who knows what other stuff she can hide from you.", "NTA. Not kissing someone on the lips is an acceptable boundary for most people. Some would even consider it cheating  regardless of circumstances. That she doesn't get it is a bit alarming.", "NTA. Kissing someone on the lips is not a friendly gesture, it\u2019s clearly a romantic action (in most parts of the world). Your girlfriend is gaslighting you, trying to downplay the fact that she did something wrong. You\u2019re absolutely within your rights to be uncomfortable with the situation.", "This was hilarious and made my day go from bad to better very fast. Thanks for this", "Yep the social media post makes it a lot worse.  They knew he would see it. \n\nThe excuse of it being a joke is also weird. What exactly was the joke?", "Kissing someone else while your in a relationship is cheating though isn't it?", "I agree but he isn\u2019t the one who compared it to that. They are trying to make him the bad guy by insinuating that that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying", "Lips touching lips willingly is cheating", "Would she be upset if you kissed another friend?", "Imagine trying to give the gf sympathy and hypotheticals. It wasn't another girl. So who gives a fuck", "This. This is how I feel about it. Like OP, you\u2019ve even said you would be less uncomfortable if it was a woman she kissed. This is a you not a her issue. So for me, it\u2019s also in YTA territory. I\u2019m a queer transman and I have and will continue to kiss my besties, sometimes on the lips. Neither of my partners care (cause I\u2019m poly) and none of my friends partners care either. Like, we are all very secure in ourselves and our relationships", "I hope OP reads this one.", "Hold the roll brotha. I have no worries about her being alone. The thing is I know I can trust her. It just really isn\u2019t a great situation though.", "See I would\u2019ve agreed with you if this is about the way she dressed, talked but kissing? for other people is a big deal.

However if it happens again that\u2019s a different story. I think this in all is a learning oppurtunity for her and I", "This is what I feel like sometimes I\u2019m over reacting. Would u like to see the picture?", "That\u2019s not how this works. A straight woman is not immediately attracted to every single damn man", "Usually because I wasn\u2019t aware of anything she had been doing and was checking in on her. She is currently in her hometown, I am not.", "Glad I could help.", "I swear I didn't cheat, I only put the tip in.", "Is it because you don't see women as a threat but you do men?", "That\u2019s not what they\u2019re trying to do, they\u2019re trying to call him homophobic.", "Not this. Just because your experience is that your close friends don't care does not mean that works for everyone. Also, being poly means there's going to be more acceptance of it to begin with. Lots of monogamous people don't wanna see their partner kissing anyone on the lips.", "Do ya know that tho? This post kinda says otherwise.  Especially if she can't understand why its a problem. Yall need to sit down, in person, and set some boundaries so there aren't any more surprises or \"jokes\" in the future.", "The thing is that you two have different boundaries. Her enforcing her boundaries is not good for you and you enforcing your boboundaries is too controlling for her. I mean talk it out but the trust mismatch is never a good sign", "I feel like that depends on the person, their love languages and their friendship imo. I personally don't like physical touch, but I have friends who kiss everyone.", "Perfect! All the best to you!", "Don\u2019t fall for the trap OP you are NOT overreacting. She clearly is an adult and understands kissing is a no go no matter what, I\u2019m gonna sound like TA here and that\u2019s fine but you need to break up with her, no one and I mean no one that plans on staying loyal with their SO would ever kiss someone behind their SOs back and not just that she didn\u2019t even call or text you at all?? Not normal.", "No but you also don't kiss people you find ugly on the lips", "No shit but when she kisses one, attraction is in the realm of possibility for her. Like that makes it cheating for me.

You could argue a gay man is not but considering this gay man is kissing women then doubt that this man is 100% gay and not bi is legitimate.", "And that would be even more stupid and ridiculous. He's upset with his gf. That's it. Clear as day, it's about what his gf did. Trying to inject him being homophobic is fishing for bullshit to make him the bad guy.

We will need to sit down and talk about it and move forward", "Yeah tbh I\u2019m not trying to be all controlling crazy bf. The issue at hand really was that it caught me off guard.
