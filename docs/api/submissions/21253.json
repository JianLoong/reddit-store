I compared it to cheating and she got very upset and now he is mad at me too. I was just trying to explain how uncomfortable it made me feel and how I want to set this boundary and she is telling me it\u2019s ridiculous and saying I am comparing her to much worse circumstances.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Regardless of who, or the reason.\n\nYoure within your rights to be uncomfortable and raise that as an issue.\n\nWhether you raised it in a productive way or not is hard to say because you were scarce on the details of the conversation.", "NTA - but it definitely sounds like you're the third person in this relationship. If your partner can't understand that completely reasonable boundary in a monogamous relationship, then it's definitely possible she doesn't care or her values and boundaries are so different that you'll probably never align.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with my bf kissing his lesbian best friend. But I also don\u2019t think I would compare it to cheating.", "NTA- it\u2019s a boundary you have, and she needs to respect that. i think it\u2019s pretty normal to be upset about your gf kissing someone, even if that someone is a gay man", "A kiss on the cheek of your gay friend is a sweet gesture.  A kiss on the lips is a whole different ballgame.  You are (rightfully) uncomfortable with your gf doing so.  NTA", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in your shoes and think you did very well with communicating your feelings. You\u2019re not being unreasonable and it\u2019s ok to have boundaries like this in a relationship", "NTA. You have a boundary and it's reasonable, to be honest, to want certain intimate acts to be between you two. I am not sure if you'd feel the same if this was a woman she was kissing, to be honest, but not really the point (although the net effect is: they're not interested in your girlfriend). \n\nEven if she thinks it's a silly one, she should respect it and find a compromise like pecks on the cheek, if that's one. She's taking it way too far with the insinuations unless you did imply this somehow in a way you're not mentioning.", "NTA. You were communicating with her. She's being defensive and not understanding your point of view.", "Would you be acting the same if it was a female friend she kissed instead?", "NTA. You have boundaries and it needs to be discussed. Her not listening to your boundaries is a huge \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Lips is lips. That\u2019s a no go zone.", "NTA. You\u2019re not comfortable with it, you told her, she threw a tantrum.\n\nGood chance her gay friend isn\u2019t so gay.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s up to you, but you should probably end this relationship now and save yourself some valuable time.", "I'd say NAH, but only because my daughter is naturally affectionate with her friends - both gfs and gay besties - and a bf telling her she had to stop would be a giant red flag. It would come off as controlling bs and no one has any time for that. Have a calm heart-to-heart and see what's comfortable for both of you. If you can't reach a compromise, then maybe you're just not compatible. Good luck.", "Ehhhhh it's hard for me to judge here since some cultures are really into platonic lip kisses (like, pecks).\n\nINFO: What kind of kiss was this? Pecks on the lips seem permissible to me if you're that kind of affectionate person. If it's longer than a peck or there is saliva involved then I can understand having more discomfort. What exactly is the boundary you want to set here?", "NAH\n\nYou have a reasonable boundary.\n\nIt would also be reasonable for her to not want to change her ways.\n\nIt could prove to be a fundamental incompatibility between you two, but I don't think anyone is at fault here.", "I'm going to say NAH because the boundary wasn't set prior to the action so she didn't break any trust, but you also have every right to be upset.

Maybe it's just me but I can't understand having the desire to share an intimate moment with someone who isn't your partner.", "NTA It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s gay or her kissing another girl. You have set your boundaries and she can not dictate how YOU should feel. What did she technically is cheating.", "I probably could\u2019ve handled the conversation better but I got upset when it became very much talking in circles. \u201c im upset\u201d \u201c ok sorry my bad \u201c ok  \u201cbut he\u2019s gay and he\u2019s my best friend and it was a joke\u201d", "This is a really good question. I have actually thought about this even.  I don\u2019t think I would be irked as much as I am, though I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing to do when you have a SO", "I wasn\u2019t like hey hard stop- I was just like hey??? That makes me uncomfortable??", "Does your daughter kiss all of her friends on the lips? \n\nOr better question would you be ok with your partner kissing other people?", "Definitely didn\u2019t look like a cute peck. Looked like a drunk smooch on the lips. It honestly really bugs me thinking about it.", "If she can\u2019t accept your boundary, part ways.", "Yes, that part was reasonable, but then you said \"it was a boundary you wanted to set\". For a naturally affectionate person, that would come off as controlling. I do get your perspective though. It's worth another conversation for sure.", "To answer your first question, no, not all of her friends. As I said in my comment, gfs and gay besties and not all of those. Not everyone is so inclined. Consent is key, lol.\n\nAnd, after 35 years of marriage, if my husband wanted to start smooching his guy friends and lesbian besties, I'd tell him to go for it tbh. Whatever floats his boat. Good relationships stretch and grow and allow each partner to be their best selves. We only make our relationships small and brittle when we restrict each other. To be clear, we've never cheated or given each other any reason to distrust each other though, so I am admittedly much more carefree because I can be. He would never jeopardize our marriage and neither would I.", "Then that's a perfectly reasonable boundary to set, IMO. Maybe wait to discuss further with your gf in person when she's back from her trip and emotions have cooled a bit and you might both have an easier time communicating about this. Otherwise you might just not be compatible.", "Yeah all people aren\u2019t the open and nude beach going type.", "Lmao, where did that come from? We're neither of those things. And why are you here? Did my verdict rub you the wrong way? Let me guess, since that's what we're doing now I guess, you're a controlling ah and want the gf to listen to her menfolk? Project much, lol?"]}
