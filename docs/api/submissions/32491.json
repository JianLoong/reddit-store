It is deeply unhealthy for them to 1) bother your friends to get information on you  2) ask you to wear a tracker omg 3) pretend to not know how intrusive and inappropriate this behavior is for an adult child.\n\nPlease, get into therapy yourself to learn how to manage appropriate boundaries with your dad / parents. I assume you live at home so this might be difficult to achieve, but please know this is NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR and it likely won't stop until you set more stringent boundaries.\n\nLook for ways to be firm with your dad, and also perhaps a compromise like you will (when across the country) call home once a day to check in, or text. I'm not sure his behavior will stop until you dramatically reduce contact though.", "NTA you're a fucking adult, you don't need his permission, and whats the difference between asked to keep your location on and a tracker? Hes a controlling asshole, you should cut off.", "NTA You're an entire adult. If he feels like he did such a bad job that you still need a grownup tracking your location that's a him problem.", "You're NTA. You're a grown ass woman, and your father's behavior is controlling and a bit unhinged. What you said was pretty mild IMO. You're allowed to have reasonable boundaries and you're allowed to use your words to enforce those boundaries. \n\nCan I offer you some advice, from someone who grew up with a similar father? Get into therapy if you can. When you're raised that way your sense of normal is so skewed you put up with all sorts of stuff that you shouldn't, and you have no idea. You literally attract personalities that want to control and use you. You stand a much better chance of having successful, healthy relationships as an adult if you can break that cycle when you're young.", "NTA\n\nYou're 21. Why is he treating you like a 12 year old?", "NTA. Why do you, at 21, have to ask your parents permission to go on a trip? If it is because you are living with them/dependent on them, you should work on your independence first of all. Move out. Support yourself. Always refuse other people to track you, whether by tracker or phone location. That is just creepy controlling.", "Why do you even ask for permission? How would they even find out that you've gone somewhere, do they come to your apartment to check every day if you are home?", "Ok listen, I\u2019m a dad, I\u2019m not your dad, but I do have adult children all with advanced degrees that are living normal lives with normal relationships. So I guess I did an ok job at least, so I will weigh in as a dad\u2026\n\nAt your age, your dad should have no say in what you do. He can offer an opinion, or advice, but he gets no say, and he doesn\u2019t get to make you feel guilty for choosing to do something he doesn\u2019t want you to.\n\nYour dad is acting like a controlling jerk, and this seems like a pattern. I think it\u2019s time you set some firm boundaries with him. There is an a-hole here, but it is not you. You are NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re 21. You\u2019re an adult. When you live under someone\u2019s roof they have the power to make you follow their rules,  but it doesn\u2019t follow that their rules are OK. Your dad isn\u2019t being reasonable, he\u2019s being controlling, intrusive and disrespectful. You may have to put up with it until you can get out, but don\u2019t let him use those questions-that-aren\u2019t-really-questions (if there\u2019s only one acceptable answer, it\u2019s not really a question) to make you believe that what he\u2019s doing is OK. It\u2019s not. Hold on to that", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nThis isn't ok, your Dad is way overstepping normal boundaries.\n\nHe needs to get into therapy. You may need to go LC to prevent further intrusion.", "If it had been a one-off incident this would be up for debate, but as it stands you're NTA for what you said or how you feel about it. In the larger context of your dad's control issues, this is really invasive.\n\nYou need to stop going along with what he wants just because he wants it though. You're 21; why on earth are you asking for permission to go anywhere? Are your parents paying for your flight? If not, asking permission already makes you look controllable. You don't need to ask, you don't need to listen to them saying no, and you don't need to enable tracking on your phone or on your person. You're kind of the asshole to yourself as long as you enable this behaviour from them.", "NTA but you could\u2019ve phrased that better. I absolutely get what you\u2019re trying to say though. Hopefully he\u2019s just being overprotective? A friend of mine has parents like that. \n\nTell him that you understand that he is worried about you, but these worries are mostly unfounded and that he\u2019s doing way more harm than good. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask permission as a 21 year old to go anywhere. You are an adult. You are legally and physically and emotionally capable of taking care of yourself (assumably). Having a tracker is completely inappropriate unless you are going into the desert or the wilderness. And calling your friends for non emergencies is a breach of your privacy. Tell him these things are making you very uncomfortable and just be honest about how you feel. \n\nThen try to set boundaries with him. It will be harder because you live with him but maybe starting small and working your way up will help? I mean obviously you shouldn\u2019t have to do that but if he\u2019s resistant it may do more harm than good. Try telling him you are trying to be responsible and independent by doing this, because he won\u2019t always be there for you. (Unsure about this part, inexperienced with this, but the responsibility speech worked on my mom and dad)", "\"im f21 and last week, i went to massachusetts to visit a friend from highschool. i\u2019m from california, so my parents immediately worried about me going on my first solo cross country trip. i had to ask for permission damn near 100 times and they said no each time, until they finally said yes in october\"  \n\n\nYou're 21, you litteraly dont need to ask for their permission.", "NTA. He is a super controlling narcissist that is gaslighting you so much you go along with it. PLEASE set some boundaries. What he is doing is NOT normal behavior, that is NOT how dads are supposed to act.", "NTA but I'll bet you're the baby of the family and so are wrapped in bubble wrap and safe is what he wants you need to set clear boundaries and start living your life but be a little patient your dad obviously loves you and cares how you feel work with him on it and if it doesn't get better then move forward from there not all parents even give a shit if there kid is dead or not so don't cut him off for caring to much unless he keeps crossing those boundaries you set with him", "Info:  Do you live in your dad's house or do you have your own place?", "Reading this, your dad doesn't sound controlling but rather sounds anxious? scared?  I picture him wringing his hands and pacing the floor as he waits by the phone for you to call him.\n\nIf so, a little bit YTA since you know this is how he is, and you should have a different kind of conversation with him (or likely he needs therapy to work out his own insecurities).\n\nIf he's the controlling-type, then definitely NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
