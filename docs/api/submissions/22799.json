Caring for a newborn is not something that can be done by just one person.

He's not likely to change so do not let him gaslight or manipulate you into thinking his behavior is ok or in any way acceptable. Or that you're stuck with him because nobody would want you (a common tactic used to manipulate women into stayiny with shitty partners). You're not stuck, and they are plenty of people out there who will care for and about you.  \n\nYou need to decide if you can deal with being married to someone who doesn't see you as a priority and will likely always leave you to fend for yourself or if you want to give yourself an opportunity to find a partner who is actually a partner.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA. None of his behavior is normal, kind, loving or fair. I'm sorry what should be a special time for you is being ruined by a selfish lout who seems to be in denial that he's now a father and needs to step up. The fact that he thinks you should have someone else to keep you company so he can get drunk four out of 14 days is beyond belief. I hope you have someone else to help you get out of there.

When I complained he told me I was selfish. I was flabbergasted and hurt. BUT IT NEVER GOT BETTER! I\u2019m wish to God I\u2019d packed up and left at that moment before he got invested in it being \u201chis\u201d son. I went through years of absolute hell and so did my children.

Right now he\u2019ll be relieved.", "So bc you are healing rather quickly, you think he thinks that he is fine to go out and get hammered or tipsy on the joy of being a dad, leaving the new born and the mom (the one who delivered) alone. \n\nI do not think he thinks that. You mentioned he left you alone during pregnancy as well. I think the dad just shows his true nature : immature irresponsible and selfish. \n\nChild support will not make you feel less alone but you would be relieved of a deadweight and avoid an ocean of disappointment. \n\nNTA, but you are not his mom, you should not shout at him like that, as you see it is as inefficient as a mom shouting at a teenager... Pointless and you lose energy.

Cue the red flag. This guy is 13 years older than you are yet seems like a college student going out with his frat brothers. He's not going to grow up and realize he's got a child to take care of. Hell, he's almost 40 and would rather go out and get buzzed and leave you alone with the child all day.
