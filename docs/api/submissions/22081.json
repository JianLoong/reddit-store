It's likely the dog bit your daughter because the dog was uncomfortable in the car and would have bit ANYONE reaching into the car. \n\nYour brother needs to have his dogs taken away from him because it's obvious he doesn't care about them.", "NTA. \n\nHis dog attacked and possibly disfigured your daughter for life. He doesn't give a shit, which is why he never apologized. So, his \"family loyalty\" is already on display. If my dog attacked any of my nieces or nephews, I'd be at the hospital with my card/cash in hand. \n\nThe fact that other family members agree that the dog is a problem, but blame you seems like a golden child situation to me. They know it's a problem, but think you should have ignored it to keep him happy. \n\nI'd go full NC with him after sending an invoice for her medical bills.", "NTA, Where Im from if the doctors suspect or know youve been bitten by a dog they are obligated to tell the authorities and animal control will take the dog and put it \"jail\" for a week just to make sure theres no rabies or other infections.\n\nAlso, unless your brother has a Tesla and put the car in \"pet mode\", hes putting the dog in danger by locking it up in a hot car. Also, the way the dog attacked your daughter immediately is a huge redflag and something needs to be done with its behavior before it becomes worse.", "NTA. Pet owners who have don't feel they need to be responsible for their pets' action and safety around humans should not own pets.", "NTA but I do feel sorry for the dog", "NTA. It's really not great that your family all think the dog is dangerous but prioritize appeasing your brother over preventing that dog injuring or killing someone else.\n\nSo sorry about your child's injury; I hope she recovers soon and heals well.", "NTA. people hate the consequences of their own actions. It\u2019s so incredibly dangerous to leave a dog in a hot car. I really hope your daughter recovers quickly", "What! - Your brother felt that you should sacrifice your daughter's health to protect his vicious dogs?  I think that you scored a win when he went no contact.  And your family wants you to take responsibility for the attack?  (The physician was going to report the attack.  If you did not divulge the dogs' owner, the police would assume that you were either guilty or negligent.)\n\nOh, and NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you hadn't cooperated, you would be the one in trouble. The dogs are dangerous, and need to be dealt with somehow. Why should you be loyal to someone that allowed his niece to be bitten and did nothing about it, not even helping with the medical bill?", " NTA but that dog bit your daughter not because it was dangerous but possibly because it was uncomfortable in a hot car. Your brother is TA and those dogs should be taken awayZ", "NTA.  Your brother is a shitty dog owner and it's both a danger to the community and a disservice to the poor dogs to allow him to still have them.   Unfortunately he'll just get other dogs and continue being a shitty dog owner.", "NTA. In my state, all animals who bite humans have to be reported to the public health officer per state law.
