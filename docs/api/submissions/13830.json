Time to draw a line in the sand.  He warned me to not,  He hasn't replied to, This is not a good sign. His siblings feel so strongly about it. Let them take her in.", "NTA if your twins are scared of her this is an untenable situation. Why can't the others take her in?", "NTA. Of course you don\u2019t take on the care of a niece who your daughters are terrified of. Absolutely not.", "Why are your twins terrified of Emily? Edit: Never mind, answered in comments.\n\nI think NTA. You said she can stay a few days, so hopefully she can figure something out in that time, or maybe her mom will cool off and let her go back home.\n\nThat's a pretty concerning criminal history, especially for someone so young. Her mom couldn't handle her, so it makes sense you  feel like she needs somebody more qualified than you.\n\nFred sees himself in her and wants to help her, and that's understandable, but arson?That's scary; I wouldn't want someone with a history of arson staying with me, and you have kids to look out for.  Fred was a \"problem child\", but did he have the same types of problems with the law that she does?", "NTA. you are reasonably assessing your capacity to take care of Emily and the effect it will have on your family. This is a tough situation given that you and your husband do not agree and he has equal say. I would argue that both of you have a veto right and unless both agree she can not stay. \n\nINFO: Did any of his other siblings offered to take her in?", "NTA.  Your niece is a minor. Your SIL can't just throw her out. She can do so when Emily is 18. Call your SIL and tell her to come pick Emily up.", "INFO: the siblings that are saying you're the AH...which one of them is her father and why isn't he taking her in?", "Why are your twins terrified of their cousin?", "NTA.  You said a few days is fine and that should be enough.  Her mom is legally obligated to take care of her until she is 18.  Giving them time to cool down and then getting them together for a moderated conversation should help, as will family therapy.  Your responsibility starts with your kids.  It\u2019d be a very nice thing to do to take her in but you\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting to.", "NTA - it\u2019s your home, you have every right to choose who you live with. Also a 17 yr old should already have some plan what they want to do in life, crashing at uncle\u2019s place is not really a plan.", "Your twins wellbeing trumps your nieces. Use that as  a guiding principle in your decision-making. Drill it into uour husband so that he has jis priorities in order. .", "NTA. Most people, if they're honest with themselves, are iffy about their own teenagers living with them.\n\n I'm wondering how long your husband plans to ignore you and the fact that your girls are locking themselves in their room.\n\nStick to your veto.\n\nWhen that fails, feel free to do the usual things that make teens not want to live with you: tell her to get a job, set room and board charges, post a chore list (give her a third of them), and set a curfew and behavior contract (i.e. no screaming at kids, no committing felonies). Start the chores and rules today. You can wait to charge rent if she stays a week,  but do the rest today.", "Nta. \"my twins are frankly quite terrified of Emily\". That is all you need to say. You children deserve a safe environment and one that feels safe to them. Emily needs to leave. If your husband doesn't understand that then perhaps he needs to leave as well. The wellbeing of your children have to come first.", "NTA \nI would never let a trouble maker live with me no matter whether it\u2019s my niece, brother or father. You can be sure Emily is going to cause lots of problems.\n\nYour husband has no right to take her in against your wishes. What about one of his other siblings let her stay with them if they think it\u2019s wrong to reject her.", "Tell your husband under no uncertain terms that if he brings her in, you will leave with the twins. Tell him it's not a negotiation, and if he doesn't seriously consider the severity of what he's pushing to bring in, and the very real impact it will have on your kids, then the next time he leaves the house, to not be surprised if he returns to an empty home. \n\nOP, your husband values his niece over the safety of his actual children. That's the message he's sending. Your only priority is to your children, and that should be the only narrative you pursue. \n\nI say this seriously. If he comes home and finds you haven't bluffed, what he does next will show you the true merit of the man you've married.", "NTA I would have said no one was except your husband seems to have made a decision regarding your household as if he is the only one that gets to decide.  He also involved his family in what is a decision that should be between the two of you and now they are harassing you. This is not how a good marriage or partnership works. Also you have two children of your own to consider before agreeing to let your troubled neice come stay with you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a huge responsibility, and it isn\u2019t right for the rest of his family to just dismiss your discomfort.  Esp when her own mother kicked her out", "If you take someone in your home that your kids are scared of, you would be TA. Stick to your guns.

This is a Very very dark red flag.. read up on Arson personality.", "My oldest nephew was like that. He was a \u201cjoiner in\u201d with no respect for the law. He lived with his father and his younger brother and sister. He was 15 when his father dropped him off with Social Services as \u201cout of control\u201d after he was with a gang who set a car on fire.\n\nHis mother was remarried with a new family, and my nephew hated his step-father son that was out.\n\nWe lived over 120 miles away, near his grandparents - who didn\u2019t think they could cope. The Social worker came to visit us with our nephew - who we adored. It was a full and Frank discussion, and my nephew basically admitted that he would likely behave for just a coup,e of months then gravitate to the same sort of people and continue with his misbehaviour. I pointed out that that behaviour would be unfair on his cousins as it would make their lives hard if I had to go out looking for him late at night, or attend the Police Station for an interview as I had a demanding job. \n\nIt was agreed that he would live in the small flat attached to a Children\u2019s home until he left school, when if his behaviour had shown worthy he would be given the tenancy on a studio flat.\n\nToday my nephew is a qualified car mechanic who has not only bought his flat but also a 3 bed house. He lets out the studio flat (it is in London). He is happily married with a 21yo son, who is thinking of joining the Police and an 11yo daughter. His wife is an assistant to their local MP.\n\nHe still has the same cheeky personality - but learnt to say \u201cno\u201d", "op=NTA\n\nbreaking the law, arson and drugs around your 9 yr old children?

But your husband has other siblings, so if they have such an issue with it then they can take her in.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and my twins are frankly quite terrified of Emily\" .. this means it can not even be for a feew days.

I'm up in the air on the AH or not  On the one hand I see your point and you have to protect your family. In the other hand I think Emily might need someone to stand up for her. Her mom may be part of her problem. Either way good luck to you and your family I hope it works out.", "NTA. Others have already explained why.\n\n> However I have been getting messages from his other siblings saying i was an asshole to reject a teenager that has no where to go.\n\nGreat. Pull them all into a group chat and tell them you are very happy they all agreed to providing a home for Emily in this situation and they should coordinate between them who is best suited to take care of her.

He has admitted to doing some not quite legal stuff but he got away with it as for arson.

So that was the vandalism and arson charge", "So Emily is my SIL's child and she's a single mother.", "The last time the twins met her, they went into her room without permission. So her reaction was to scream at my girls, i don't agree with the reaction but my girls were at fault so I just ushered them out.

If they are afraid of Emily and feel they need to lock their bedroom doors in their own home then Emily needs to go. If your husband has a problem with that then he needs to go.

You're not an asshole for not wanting to inherit someone else's problem/responsibility.", "as others say in this, shes 17, legally the mother must take her back, call her and tell her to come take her back or else youll have to call the cops and cps to have them deal with her, she had the child and is legally required to give the most basic care (its sad to have to word it that way) till the kid is 18 and an adult.  \nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour children come first and she isn't your responsibility."]}
