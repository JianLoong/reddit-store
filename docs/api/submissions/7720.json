I think you and she are not compatible and I think you need a partner who would be happy to spend only an evening a week with you. \n\nYou literally don't want to spend more than one evening a week with her.  Time apart and doing your own thing is healthy, but in moderation. It kind of sounds like mentally you are single. \n\nBut it sounds like you spend almost every evening apart doing your own things and also want to spend the entire weekend, EVERY weekend doing your own thing.  So when do you actually want to be with her? You want to spend a lot more time actually hanging with your parents than you do with your partner. And you need to consider why. So I would suggest couples therapy. \n\nEating together is great, but even flatmates can spend 15 minutes chewing silently together, it doesn't by itself make for a meaningful or supportive relationship.

I think you really need to think hard why you dont even want to spend 1 weekend a month with your partner in life.\n\nYour partner of 10 years is asking to spend one weekend a month with you, and you cannot stand the idea. I need to ask; Why are you in a relationship with her? It sounds like you would ge better suited to having a fuckbuddy you call up once a week when you want to hang out. \n\nI don't see what she us getting out of this relationship, and I would not be surprised if she leaves following your refusal to spend time with her.

He spent most of his time with me, practically living there, but he still kept his own (rented) apartment and went to stay several weekends a month. For the longest time I thought it was a good deal, I also enjoy being alone and reload in the quiet. But it wasn\u2019t healthy for either of us. I always felt that he kept his apartment as a \u201cfoot out the door\u201d, and not as a place to \u201creload \u201c as he claimed.
