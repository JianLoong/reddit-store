First, thanks for all the support. Based on your replies, I went to a teacher I trust, and she told me I should report it\n\nI met with the principal, my parents, and the head nurse on Thursday. I'm glad I reported it, because the nurse started off by saying that she still doubted the diagnosis and was reconsidering the process in case of an episode\n\nI don\u2019t have a formal second opinion/diagnosis per se but a neurologist here renews my prescription. The original documents were translated for the transfer of care process, so I brought them (even if they\u2019re already in my school medical file) to show the principal, along with a letter from the (American) neurologist, which I read out loud. I then thanked the nurse for her concern but asked what it was based on. She was pissed and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her about the American diagnosis. I said it wasn\u2019t one, the diagnosis was made in Spain. She asked the principal if \u201cthe insurance were even okay with a diagnosis coming from *there*\u201d. She added she \u201cdoubted they were able to conduct all the tests\u201d. So I asked her which ones they had missed, to which she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a specialist\u201d. I couldn\u2019t find a good comeback on the spot, but my mum laughed, and I think that was good enough\n\nThe principal ended the meeting, and sent us an email on Friday saying that the process would remain the same. My dad hasn\u2019t formally apologised, but he did say that she overstepped her qualifications. I\u2019m glad I went ahead and reported it, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t. Thanks again for all the support, good luck to everyone out there struggling with the same issues, stay safe", "created_utc": 1683477804, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13avqjt/update_aita_for_telling_a_school_nurse_i_dont/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Congratulations for advocating for yourself. You did a VERY good thing.  \n\nUnfortunately, far too many people from the USA have clouded judgements and biases with the sheer amount of brainwashing that happens being pushed on them regarding how the USA is the best country in the world with the best medical system and doctors, etc.", "Glad it all worked out in the end.\n\nTBH, I was kind of hoping they would fire this xenophobic asshole nurse. She sounds egotistical like she knows everything even though she\u2019s just a SCHOOL NURSE. No shade on school nurses but you came in with a formal diagnosis from a SPECIALIST\u2026.who the hell does she think she is.", "I'm a European living in the US. I have lived in 4 different European countries and have never met the same medical incompetence as I have met here in the US. It really is absurd. Good for you for advocating for yourself!", "Thanks for the update. I'm in Europe and I highly regard the medical care here (and their costs ;-) ).", "The typical 'murrican ignorance and narcissism. They all think they are the best at everything, while not realising they live in a 3rd world country.", "You exhibited such courage for someone of your age! F*ck yeah I\u2019m so proud of you. That nurse sounds like a walking liability if her attitude towards you is any indication. I\u2019m frustrated they didn\u2019t let her go because her behavior/self-important ignorance could hurt or kill someone. \n\nI\u2019m Sorry it had to go this far, and I\u2019m sorry your Dad didn\u2019t immediately see through her BS and back you. But I\u2019m glad you have a teacher you trust and that the school overruled her. Although I\u2019m still a little worried that the nurse may be spiteful with you because you \u201cembarrassed\u201d her (she embarrassed herself). I don\u2019t suppose this school more than one nurse or there are extra measures you can take to ensure you get the care you need regardless of her opinions or actions?", "Glad for you that you'll not have to be in fear of having necessary medical attention when needed.  It's never acceptable to be gaslit by someone who thinks they know better.", "I am happy to hear this outcome.  I am glad you stood up for yourself.", "Omg good job girl! \nAlso: nurse's qualification is that one that starts with a R and ends with acism", "And/or theres some racism and xenophobia mixed in there with the whole \u201cfrom *there*\u201d bit", "It's only been a few days, so hopefully when I go back on Monday she won't be there anymore, in any case I'm pretty sure her reputation in the school is f-ed up now, and you won't hear me complain about it", "I don't think this woman realizes that Spain is in Europe. I think she heard the word \"Spanish\" and thought OPs doctor is a \"dirty Mexican\". Do you think she would have had the same reaction if OPs doctor was French or German?\n\nThis is in no way implying that Mexican health care is sub-par, just that this nurse is so racist that she has forgotten basic geography.", "I recently saw a aita posts about illegal child marriage ( the girl was 17 years old and occurred in US). I commented to that post to report to police and get relatives on their side. One of the redditor said, US didn't Ban child marriage as a whole country , only in 5 states they banned it.\n\n I felt a bit better about not being born in US \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n( add the medical bills + gun laws + abortion laws + whatever else is going on there etc)", "America is not perfect but it\u2019s not even close to a third world country. Don\u2019t be naive", "The typical prejudice against Americans and lumping them all together in one group.", "There's another nurse, who's been here for longer, and who's always nice with me. At least she's there for me, and now the principal knows about it as well. And as you say, she's embarrassed herself, all the teachers have already seen me go through an episode and they know the process is correct, so really I think I'm in good hands now!", "The really disturbing part is that child marriage is not illegal in many states, in some only legal with judicial approval.", "https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/13a2fxh/active_shooter_at_a_mall_in_allen_texas_multiple/\n\nWoosh!", "That warms my ice cold heart!
