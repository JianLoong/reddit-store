First, thanks for all the support. Based on your replies, I went to a teacher I trust, and she told me I should report it\n\nI met with the principal, my parents, and the head nurse on Thursday. I'm glad I reported it, because the nurse started off by saying that she still doubted the diagnosis and was reconsidering the process in case of an episode\n\nI don\u2019t have a formal second opinion/diagnosis per se but a neurologist here renews my prescription. The original documents were translated for the transfer of care process, so I brought them (even if they\u2019re already in my school medical file) to show the principal, along with a letter from the (American) neurologist, which I read out loud. I then thanked the nurse for her concern but asked what it was based on. She was pissed and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her about the American diagnosis. I said it wasn\u2019t one, the diagnosis was made in Spain. She asked the principal if \u201cthe insurance were even okay with a diagnosis coming from *there*\u201d. She added she \u201cdoubted they were able to conduct all the tests\u201d. So I asked her which ones they had missed, to which she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a specialist\u201d. I couldn\u2019t find a good comeback on the spot, but my mum laughed, and I think that was good enough\n\nThe principal ended the meeting, and sent us an email on Friday saying that the process would remain the same. My dad hasn\u2019t formally apologised, but he did say that she overstepped her qualifications. I\u2019m glad I went ahead and reported it, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t.

Which poor would you prefer to be?? Poor in third world country or poor here? Let me answer for you from experience of my family having immigrated at the time, HERE HERE a thousands times here. Not even a question. You guys have NO idea what you\u2019re talking about. I guarantee that 99.9999% of people from third world country would answer the same as I did. I have built myself my own future and life since, but at the time, back then, I would have answered here, always, every single time.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s any sort of comparison, bringing up bad schools here and forgetting that 3rd world countries there are NO SCHOOLS, you\u2019d be sleeping on half a mattress with 10 other people and waking up to go to work as a 9 year old\u2026.let me ask again, which one is going to be better for a child, going to a bad school here and dealing with the hardships that come with low income schools but still having a school to go to, and desks to sit in, and class to be in and learn, and even have a lunch sponsored, or waking up and going to help fish or collect rocks or woods or neither and joining rebels and being half ass \u201ctrained\u201d on a machine gun?? Or even a less extreme example, you go to school but there\u2019s 50 kids, no desks no chairs you sit on the floor and the teacher himself/herself has the education of 9th grader here and they\u2019re teaching with no equipment and 1 book is shared by 4 people?? Do you realize my grandpa learned how to read (barely) upside down because he was sitting opposite to where the one book that his 10 peers shared so when he was alive  he held books upside down (he mostly only read religious books and struggles doing that but still, he reads upside down cuz there were no books to share). So signs in the streets would be not readable to him\u2026just one example of many of how third world countries \u201cschools\u201d wouldn\u2019t even be on the same equation as the bad schools here. It\u2019s all relative and the USA will win every single time if the \u201ccompetition\u201d is an actual 3rd world country.", "And we\u2019re happy to have you.
