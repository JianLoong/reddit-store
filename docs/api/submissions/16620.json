First, thanks for all the support. Based on your replies, I went to a teacher I trust, and she told me I should report it\n\nI met with the principal, my parents, and the head nurse on Thursday. I'm glad I reported it, because the nurse started off by saying that she still doubted the diagnosis and was reconsidering the process in case of an episode\n\nI don\u2019t have a formal second opinion/diagnosis per se but a neurologist here renews my prescription. The original documents were translated for the transfer of care process, so I brought them (even if they\u2019re already in my school medical file) to show the principal, along with a letter from the (American) neurologist, which I read out loud. I then thanked the nurse for her concern but asked what it was based on. She was pissed and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her about the American diagnosis. I said it wasn\u2019t one, the diagnosis was made in Spain. She asked the principal if \u201cthe insurance were even okay with a diagnosis coming from *there*\u201d. She added she \u201cdoubted they were able to conduct all the tests\u201d. So I asked her which ones they had missed, to which she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a specialist\u201d. I couldn\u2019t find a good comeback on the spot, but my mum laughed, and I think that was good enough\n\nThe principal ended the meeting, and sent us an email on Friday saying that the process would remain the same. My dad hasn\u2019t formally apologised, but he did say that she overstepped her qualifications. I\u2019m glad I went ahead and reported it, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t. Thanks again for all the support, good luck to everyone out there struggling with the same issues, stay safe", "created_utc": 1683477804, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13avqjt/update_aita_for_telling_a_school_nurse_i_dont/", "score": 1443, "replies": ["Congratulations for advocating for yourself.

But I\u2019m glad you have a teacher you trust and that the school overruled her. Although I\u2019m still a little worried that the nurse may be spiteful with you because you \u201cembarrassed\u201d her (she embarrassed herself). I don\u2019t suppose this school more than one nurse or there are extra measures you can take to ensure you get the care you need regardless of her opinions or actions?", "Glad for you that you'll not have to be in fear of having necessary medical attention when needed.

I think she heard the word \"Spanish\" and thought OPs doctor is a \"dirty Mexican\".

He visited multiple and specialists in their fields and convinced them to visit his hospital once every two weeks or a month. One of those doctors became a dear friend later on.\n\nA decade and half later, this doctor still visits multiple small hospitals to help out.

This nurse clearly has something against none American thing sma dworse thinks other countries can't function like us. USA has one of the worst medical systems compared to several countries and don't get me started on insurance.\n\nShe overstepped is an understatement. She should be fired for questioning a doctor's diagnosis with no clear reason why and even then it's up to OP and their parents to choose if they wanna go through the testing again.", "Still think she wanted commission from referrals to her good friend the doctor.
