I'm honestly not a big fan of this and he knows that. He usually comes home from work, we eat dinner, he goes on a 1 hr bikeride to get snacks and weed (weed is legal here) and when he comes home he smokes, eat his snacks and plays videogames. Now someone at his work got some weed from a coworker and since they don't smoke they gave it to my husband. I was a bit skeptic about this, cause it was some random stuff from someone he doesn't really know. He still smoked it yesterday evening, and today he had to leave work cause he's been throwing up all morning. He went to sleep since he got home around 10 AM and is still sleeping right now (2PM).\n\nUsually when he smokes he is fine, but when he is stoned he's just a different person. He's super slow, sometimes I have to repeat myself multiple times cause he is so zoned out. Yesterday when I went to bed he was cleaning the kitchen and I asked if he could give the dog fresh water after he's done. He said yes. I asked again after brushing my teeth, he said yes. Then when he came to bed an hour later I asked him if he gave the dog fresh water and he forgot. He got out of  bed to do it, but the fact I already asked him twice and he still forgot cause he's so zoned out stresses me out. I feel like I can't trust him to do anything when he's home cause he's always stoned. \n\nI asked him before if everything is OK, if there's a reason he feels the need to smoke so much but he says he's fine. I just don't enjoy being around him anymore cause during the week we only see each other in the evening and he's stoned all that time. I feel like asking him to stop completely is maybe a bit too harsh, but smoking on the weekends should already be a big improvement I feel like. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I ask this of him?", "created_utc": 1677849885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11h0ph5/wibta_if_i_ask_my_husband_to_stop_smoking_weed/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps you should start by explaining exactly how it makes you feel that he's always stoned when you're together. If he's receptive to your feelings, he should WANT to not smoke so much, and the two of you should be able to at least find some middle ground. \n\nI'm a regular weed smoker myself, and I'm married to a woman who is not. Frankly I used to be your husband, always getting high immediately after work and then smoking all weekend. Not only did I realize that doesn't create the best environment for my wife, but it was detrimental to my own well being. I wanted to smoke less for both of us, so now I do. \n\nWhat type of weed does he typically smoke? If it's legal in your area can he visit a dispensary and tailor the weed he's smoking to his needs? Maybe he needs to switch to sativa or hybrid. Indica really zonks me out similar to what you're describing in your husband, so I don't use it.", "NTA\n\n\nSomeone stoned every night is in fact not any better as someone drunk every single night. In a relationship people look for company and a partner. He is neither.", "NTA, weed is nice and all but it's definitely annoying for people around you when you're high all the time. Leave it for the weekends", "NTA for having an honest conversation about your feelings. I don\u2019t think you should come in with a \u201crule\u201d for him like no smoking during the week.\n\nI would sit down with him and explain how is smoking effects you and your relationship. It\u2019s not unreasonable to not want to live with a zombie. During the conversation suggest only smoking on weekends, but it should be a collaborative conversation", "NTA and I say this as a daily weed smoker. Honestly, if he smokes every day and he still gets zoned out like that, I would be wondering if he\u2019s on something other than weed. He\u2019d have to be smoking an insane amount to get that stoned. \n\nMy tolerance at this point is very high, I barely act different when I smoke. If he smokes every single day, it doesn\u2019t make sense that he\u2019d still be zoned out as if it\u2019s his first time when he gets really high. \n\nEveryone is different though, so I\u2019m probably just letting my own personal experience cloud my judgment here, to be fair. Either way, he clearly cannot function when he\u2019s super high, and you have every right to be upset about that. \n\nHe can\u2019t handle it, end of story, and he should cut down.", "NTA. Frankly if it was me I would leave.", "YWNBTA. It sounds like the status quo is that there is no relationship. Your husband sounds like he is completely checked out.

I personally would not want someone telling me when I could smoke. that wouldn\u2019t work for me, but I don\u2019t think you are an ah for it.

Ask him if he would be willing to stop or reduce.\n\nI will warn you that a simple conversation probably doesn't make a difference.  This might be something where you need counseling.  People VERY RARELY change their drug usage patterns just because someone asks.", "NTA. That's a valid request, especially if it is an issue for your communication as partners .

I slowly started to smoke more and more and when the pandemic hit I got the nasty habit of smoking daily.\n\nThe big problem with weed is that it creates a surge in dopamine incredibly high. I'm no expert so I encourage you to look for info in Youtube, andrew huberman is a great source, it's a neuroscientist with a youtube channel.\n\nAnyway, back to the point, weed makes you so used to it that eventually you end up **becoming dependent on it to have a good time.** You start needing it to enjoy normal, regular hobbies. Watching a movie, going for a walk, playing a game, whatever it is.\n\nHe might not have any problem that makes him *need* to smoke, he doesn't sound addicted to me, but once the habit is made it gets really hard to get out of it. I know this because I have tried to quit two times now. I wanted to smoke only in weekends but I just couldn't stop myself from smoking as soon as I got home from work. The sweet dopamine hit is waiting for you and it need a lot of will to say no to it. The only way to genuinely stop for me was to stop buying. Now it's my first month out of it and it's hard because you get so used to it you end up missing it. The process is tedious because for te first weeks the things that used to entertain you become boring.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. But please, don't be so rushed in getting out of that relationship as some users suggest. Specially if your happy with it.

It would be the same issue without the weed: he does his bike ride, comes home, and plays video games all night and ignores your presence in his life.

They both know that they get a pass if they're having a REALLY bad time, but otherwise the \"smoke till you are a potato\" time is Friday night.  I know that, I'm fine with that, that's my night to settle down and binge-read a new series straight through with just me and the dog.  I would not be cool with having that type of separation from them on a regular, daily basis.

I had reached the point where I was drinking almost every night and usually smoking some weed - a hit, or two, but enough that combined with booze it was noticeable. It was causing problems in our family life, as I was becoming disconnected, forgetful, irritable, etc. My wife confronted me about it in a pretty \"deal breaker\" kind of way, and it was a wake-up call. There were some other issues in our relationship that needed to be addressed, so we started going to therapy together, but my first step was to stop drinking and smoking altogether.

But lemme tell ya, as long as we're smoking a sativa, we're perfectly fine taking a few rips off a bong and proceeding to deep clean the entire house.
