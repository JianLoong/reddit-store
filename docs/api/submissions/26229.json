He's a child and he should know better than to break other people things. Your cousins should pay for the replacement. NTA", "NTA, but at what cost? It's ridiculous that the blame has been shifted on you because if you didn't let him play you would have been criticised.

No. But he still broke it and therefore his parents are responsible for the cost of it.

No, but you\u2019re 19 and you were trying to do a nice thing and help out your cousins and bond with their kid. \n\nThey\u2019re the adults refusing to take responsibility for their child. Wild that your parents aren\u2019t on your side here! \n\nYou don\u2019t have much power to get them to pay unfortunately. I would try again to see if they will cover it or at least a portion of it. If they refuse, then I would refuse any further babysitting duties whil you are visiting.", "NTA. You were trying to entertain the kid for your cousin, why is it your fault he threw it?

The fact that it was a \"mistake\" doesn't mean you are not responsible for the results.

Ridiculous and makes you look stupidly uneducated.", "ESH - in a nice world parents would pay but you were responsible for Jack and let him play with it. \nParents aren't responsible for things their kids do under the supervision of others. The parents had no opportunity to say no and stop him getting it in the first place. You did. They had no opportunity to see him getting frustrated, predict what may happen and intervene before a costly mistake.\nYou were responsible for Jack, you allowed him to play with it. You were partly (mostly) responsible.\n\nIf you'd been babysitting a 2yr in your home and they'd broken something when you left them alone parents wouldn't be responsible. This is murkier because he's 6 but still not fully the parents responsibility. 6 year olds know better but it's still within the realms of normal development for them to have impulse control issues and big tantrums when upset. This was not ideal but predictable. You have some responsibility.\nWould have been different if parents were present and knew what he's doing.\nAlso you have no idea about punishment. They put him in the car and you don't know what they intended to do in the car or at home.", "ESH - you shouldn't have let him play with it and the parents needed to bring consequences to Jack. \n\nIMO they should offer to pay for half of a replacement - it's halfway your fault that it's broken, but also half his fault and they're his parents.", "You were the adult responsible for the child at the time they did it.

Thing costs a couple hundred bucks.", ">they refuse to pay for the broken switch because I shouldn't have let him play on it in the first place\n\nThat, all day long. You put ANYTHING into the hands of a toddler, there's a chance they won't give it back in the condition they received it. If your cousin had given him your switch to play with without your permission and he broke it, then yes, your cousin would be on the hook. But that's not what happened. A kid broke something you voluntarily gave him, while under *your* supervision.\n\nYTA, you owe your cousins and nephew a big fat apology.", "NTA. They SHOULD pay for the damage. If their little brat had destroyed anything else in your house because you refused to let him play on the switch and he threw a tantrum they would also say it was your fault because you \"should have just let him play\"\n\nSend emails, text messages, and constantly being this up in conversation. You will no longer babysit any of your cousins/nieces/nephews/ kids from dads side of the family because you can't trust them not to break your property. No presents or paying for anything for the relatives that agree with your aunt or parents.\n\nJust because you're blood does not mean they can disrespect you or your property like that. If they don't pay for it now then they WILL pay for it down the line when you stop helping or interacting with them.\n\nI really don't want to suggest small claims because threatening legal action takes all civility out of a relationship with someone but they've already done you dirty by destroying your expensive device and trying to play it off as nothing.", "NTH, cut them off until they apologize and pay.
