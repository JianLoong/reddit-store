Parents are responsible for the actions of their children. They owe you a new Switch.", "NTA. His parents need to learn how to parent their child. You were trying to entertain their brat and be a nice cousin. They should pay for a replacement, and at the very least should have apologized.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like it was an accident. Even at 6, the child should have known that what they did was wrong. And, especially because the child broke it consciously and on purpose, the parents should have offered to replace it. \n\nHowever - learn the lesson. *Never* let that child get a hold of something of yours again. And if anyone gives you any grief over it, bring this up and point out how everyone said it was your mistake for letting him have it in the first place.", "NTA, The parents need to learn NOW that they are responsible for their offspring. If they don't then, what are they going to do when he's a teenager?", "NTA. As a parent you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s actions and behavior. Your cousins should pay and apologize. Them doing neither shows the type of people they are. The fact that their kid is known to be rude at times is a reflection of their parenting. The kid is intelligent and knows how to get away with things since his parents let him.", "Fuck that. NTA. I\u2019m a parent of two kids and there is no way I wouldn\u2019t replace it for you if my kid did that.", "Ummm at 6 years old this is no longer a toddler. He's a child and he should know better than to break other people things. Your cousins should pay for the replacement. NTA", "NTA, but at what cost? It's ridiculous that the blame has been shifted on you because if you didn't let him play you would have been criticised. Although you shouldn't have to pay for it, I don't believe the drama will be worth it. Learn your lesson, don't let Jack play with your stuff and move on.", "NTA, I have a kid. Sucks but if my kid breaks something I'm paying for it out of my pocket. When it comes to family it makes is awkward and yeah they'll try not to pay you back smh so don't expect much out of them", "NTA\n\nShould you have let him play with it? No. But he still broke it and therefore his parents are responsible for the cost of it. This would apply in a store, too, if he decided he wanted to play with the display computers or something.", "NTA. \n\nTheir child broke it and they should pay. I\u2019m sorry this fucking sucks. \n\nWas letting a 6 year old play with a switch a great idea? No, but you\u2019re 19 and you were trying to do a nice thing and help out your cousins and bond with their kid. \n\nThey\u2019re the adults refusing to take responsibility for their child. Wild that your parents aren\u2019t on your side here! \n\nYou don\u2019t have much power to get them to pay unfortunately. I would try again to see if they will cover it or at least a portion of it. If they refuse, then I would refuse any further babysitting duties whil you are visiting.", "NTA. You were trying to entertain the kid for your cousin, why is it your fault he threw it? I'm not a parent but I feel like my parents always took responsibility for my actions as a kid.\n\nIf the kid took something expensive off the shelf at a store and smashed it, the store would make them pay yeah? This really isn't much different imo", "You are NTA. \n\nHowever, you are not getting them to pay for a new switch either.\n\nPersonally, I am an AH and would refuse to babysit Jack again, citing the money that I had lost when Jack broke my switch and their refusal to replace it.", "It doesn't matter if he did it intentionally. if I hit you with my car because I make a mistake and hit the gas instead of the brake, I am still responsible. The fact that it was a \"mistake\" doesn't mean you are not responsible for the results. And throwing something on the ground in a fit of pique is not a mistake, it's an intentionally destructive act.\n\nNTA but it doesn't sound like you are getting your switch replaced. I would avoid playing with that child in the future.", "The kid is a brat that never gets disciplined. The parents are AH for not automatically offering to pay for what their golden child destroyed. At least your sister has your back.", "YTA for the number of times you used loosing instead of losing. Ridiculous and makes you look stupidly uneducated.", "ESH - in a nice world parents would pay but you were responsible for Jack and let him play with it. \nParents aren't responsible for things their kids do under the supervision of others. The parents had no opportunity to say no and stop him getting it in the first place. You did. They had no opportunity to see him getting frustrated, predict what may happen and intervene before a costly mistake.\nYou were responsible for Jack, you allowed him to play with it. You were partly (mostly) responsible.\n\nIf you'd been babysitting a 2yr in your home and they'd broken something when you left them alone parents wouldn't be responsible. This is murkier because he's 6 but still not fully the parents responsibility. 6 year olds know better but it's still within the realms of normal development for them to have impulse control issues and big tantrums when upset. This was not ideal but predictable. You have some responsibility.\nWould have been different if parents were present and knew what he's doing.\nAlso you have no idea about punishment. They put him in the car and you don't know what they intended to do in the car or at home.", "ESH - you shouldn't have let him play with it and the parents needed to bring consequences to Jack. \n\nIMO they should offer to pay for half of a replacement - it's halfway your fault that it's broken, but also half his fault and they're his parents.", "You were the adult responsible for the child at the time they did it. They could have offered some form or f compensation, but shouldn\u2019t be fully responsible.\n\nESH", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying YTA. Because his parents were not around at the time, you were taking care of him and responsible for him for that time", "YTA. You let him play, live with the consequences.", "They should have offered to pay for it.  They didn\u2019t.  They refused when you asked.\n\nNow let it go.  Not worth the drama.  Thing costs a couple hundred bucks.", ">they refuse to pay for the broken switch because I shouldn't have let him play on it in the first place\n\nThat, all day long. You put ANYTHING into the hands of a toddler, there's a chance they won't give it back in the condition they received it. If your cousin had given him your switch to play with without your permission and he broke it, then yes, your cousin would be on the hook. But that's not what happened. A kid broke something you voluntarily gave him, while under *your* supervision.\n\nYTA, you owe your cousins and nephew a big fat apology.", "NTA. They SHOULD pay for the damage. If their little brat had destroyed anything else in your house because you refused to let him play on the switch and he threw a tantrum they would also say it was your fault because you \"should have just let him play\"\n\nSend emails, text messages, and constantly being this up in conversation. You will no longer babysit any of your cousins/nieces/nephews/ kids from dads side of the family because you can't trust them not to break your property. No presents or paying for anything for the relatives that agree with your aunt or parents.\n\nJust because you're blood does not mean they can disrespect you or your property like that. If they don't pay for it now then they WILL pay for it down the line when you stop helping or interacting with them.\n\nI really don't want to suggest small claims because threatening legal action takes all civility out of a relationship with someone but they've already done you dirty by destroying your expensive device and trying to play it off as nothing.", "NTH, cut them off until they apologize and pay. Blood may be thicker than water, but money is thicker than blood", "YTA,   you were playing with child and therefore was supervising.    The parents are not to blame, accept it and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
