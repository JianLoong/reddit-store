[UPDATE]", "selftext": "\nSo, I\u2019m (20F) sure everyone is wondering if I ended up going to my father\u2019s 40th birthday party and no I did not. But, I did go to his place for Thanksgiving. Even after everything he did in my last post I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. I wanted to try to have a relationship with him and be open minded. A full 7 days at his house trying to be open and talk and hang out with him and my step brother (13) and half brother (7) and step mother (39).\n\nBut I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that I got nothing from them. All my step brother and half brother wanted to do was sit in their room playing video games all day. I love video games and offered to join them but they told me they were already playing, didn\u2019t have enough controllers, etc. They gave EVERY excuse in the book so I didn\u2019t play with them. It was worse when my little sister(10) with autism wanted to play and my step mother told her it\u2019s the boys room and to leave them alone.\n\nI talked with my step mother a few times about girl things and life. Like, how my college life was going, what my favorite tv show was at the moment, and other things like that. But of course the topic somehow switched to the divorce and her complaining about my father\u2019s payment for child support. Then she started bad mouthing my grandmother (59) and mother (39). After that I was done with her.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure everyone is wondering how it went with my father. It didn\u2019t. Not even a little bit of a conversation that carried on for a minute. He came into my room once or twice and just said, \u201chey\u201d or \u201chow are you\u201d and then went back to his room to be on his phone. And believe me I tried to make it last longer and actually talk to him but he refused to get off the damn phone and talk to his oldest daughter.\n\nSo, once I was back home after that horrible Thanksgiving I cried into my mother\u2019s arms. I cried and cried the whole day that I got back. I wanted a relationship with my father. I wanted to try despite everything he\u2019s ever done to me and now I see that no matter what, that he doesn\u2019t care about me. So, I am done caring about him. He doesn\u2019t get anymore second chances and I am completely cutting him off from my life.", "created_utc": 1701207495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1867j91/wibta_for_not_showing_up_to_my_fathers_40th/", "score": 112, "replies": ["[#Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ay1ew/wibta_for_not_showing_up_to_my_fathers_40th/)", "You've done a very hard thing OP in accepting something a lot of people have to get therapy to accept: your father is not and will not be the father you actually need and deserve.\n\nIt sucks to want approval, validation and care from someone who is simply uninterested.", "You knew this already, but you gave it a last try. Good for you, cry it out if you need to. Go NC and just move on with your life.", "There are many people in life who will value you for the person you are. \n\nIf your father isn't one of them then the loss is his. NTA", "Proud of you OP! You've made a decision that will sting short term, but long term you'll be thanking yourself", "It will get easier as he slowly fades from your memory. Don\u2019t forget- you DESERVED a better father and one day you can build a family of your own and give your own kids the world that you were denied. It can be very cathartic. But you deserved better growing up and deserve better now. He failed you and you have done the mature and wise option here. You gave him one last shot so you wouldn\u2019t have any regrets and you shouldn\u2019t. Please thank your mom for being the type of mom that you could sob to- I\u2019m sure it was devastating for her to see your so torn up as well. Bless you both.", "I'm sorry they failed you. Glad your mom is there for you.", "I'm proud of you for trying and hopefully getting a form of closure with this side of your family. You don't need some so called step mother bad mouthing the only people who actually cared for you.", "Good for you!", "I tell her thank you every day. She\u2019s the reason I do what I do and the reason I\u2019m the person I am today. I love her very very much."]}
