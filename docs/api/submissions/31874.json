Technically I\u2019m all dried up because people won\u2019t let me have water \ud83d\ude06", "True. Maybe I\u2019ll dump it into another bottle. Such a waist of time but I get it. I need to conform to stop the behavior happening to at least me.", "I mean I really only have the 2 1L water bottles and then a glass of wine from a bottle or juice by the gallon at home. I also recycle. My water bottles say that they are recycled plastic too. I don\u2019t normally go into it blindly. I get Fiji when I\u2019m feeling classy or want crisp water but 8/10 I\u2019m drinking Ice Mountain in bulk from Sam\u2019s Club. Have you ever seen the water lines in a big city? Rusty and calcified \ud83e\udd22. I\u2019ll look into the big jug though.", "Now it makes more sense. May want to do an edit because it\u2019s written to sound like a student is stealing her teachers water from the lounge.", "And you keep buying water bottles ?\nCan\u2019t you just get a canteen and refill it ?", "Refill your water bottles w the Fiji at home", "Or use a sharpie and write your name on it? That should keep honest people from accidentally grabbing yours.", "Get a reusable water bottle. Fill it whatever the hell you want. If you get an insulated bottle and add a bit of ice it doesn\u2019t even need to go in the fridge.", "Dude why are you wasting money on water. Get a water filter like a Brita if you can\u2019t drink tap, get a big ol water bottle, fill it up and bring it. \n\nA guy I went to college with brought one of those 128oz soda plastic jugs from the gas station every day to school, full of ice and water. That guy was well hydrated. (To be clear, it was one jug he owned and would bring in from home, he wouldn\u2019t go buy water)", "Very little consumer plastic actually gets recycled, even when put in the recycling bin. Even if it is recycled, there are still resources consumed to transport it, sort it, process it into usable material, transport it some more, make it into new bottles, transport it to a bottling plant, transport it to your location\u2026\n\nAnd yeah the idea of water pipes is gross but the practical effect it has on you is minimal to none. Besides, everything else you consume made with water went through pipes that look exactly the same. Tap water won\u2019t hurt you, (there are exceptions to this of course, not everywhere has potable tap water) and there are ways to decrease your plastic consumption and the airmiles on your water sharply even if you refuse to drink tap water. Home filtration systems, renting one of those big water coolers with the big jugs of distilled water, a zero filter (like a brita but removes more stuff.)", "As someone who is pretty anti-plastic bottle, pro-tap, I think people really don't understand that some areas do genuinely have bad and even unsafe water. :/ It is often people being picky about taste, but not everyone is just being picky.\n\nI think a refillable water filter bottle is a great idea and I hope that works well for you! It sounds like you care a lot about recycling so it'd be a load off your mind to be able to cut out the plastic, plus remove any theft problems for good.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I thought too", "Yea, so surprising - drowning but also spending $3/bottle of water. Just get a water bottle and a filter.", "Seriously this broad needs a Brita."]}
