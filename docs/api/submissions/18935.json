Discussions surrounding personal beliefs and lifestyles can be challenging, especially when individuals have strongly opposing views.

The anger and hurt you felt in response is justified. However, responding with harsh words and past mistakes can escalate the situation further and strain relationships, as we've seen in this instance.\r  \n\r  \nThe goal should ideally be promoting understanding and respect for each other's identities and beliefs, even if you fundamentally disagree. Such a conversation can be tough, particularly in the heat of the moment, but it's often more productive and less likely to cause lasting harm.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your response may have been disproportionate, your frustration is understandable. A more balanced approach in the future could be to tell her how her words hurt you, to express your need for her to respect your identity, and to reinforce the importance of not letting religious disagreements become personal attacks.\r  \n\r  \nYour cousin also needs to understand the impact of her words. Maybe engaging her in a calm, non-confrontational conversation about how her comments affected you could help both of you understand each other better.\r  \n\r  \n**In summary, you're not the asshole** for feeling hurt and wanting to defend yourself. **However**, the way you chose to react might not have been the most constructive approach for maintaining family harmony.

Neener neener neener\" on the daily for a year. \n\nJFC can you please use religion to help & not hurt?", "That sounds like such a weird red line. \n\nSo basically I can rape, murder, pillage, and fornicate all I want. But as long as I say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and am sincere about it, I can go to Heaven. \n\nBut if I say \u201cyo, fuck the Holy Spirit\u201d once, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m sent to eternal damnation. No take backsies.", "What does blasphemy against the Holy Spirit mean?", "NTA I hope your aunt-cousin learned from this", "I'm so confused. In 2010 your cousin repeatedly said something along the lines of goddammit or jesus christ and didn't repent and now she is eternally barred from heaven? What church do you belong to? That is insane.", "Everyone who truly repents are washed from their sins by Jesus' blood, including your aunt, idk which cookie christian told you some people will go straight to hell even when repented because it's not true, if she believes in Christ and repented with her heart than she's saved.\n\nI don't judge and just read but wanted to correct on that.", "So, since hell is basically Dante inspired fan fiction, you're hurting each other over nothing.

For example, I remember taking a literature class on CS Lewis in university and discussing the idea that true blasphemy was attributing evil actions to god (the conversation came up after reading his Narnia series).\n\nIs Lewis solid theology/a reliable theologian- no. However, it was interesting because it turned out that was what a lot of people within this certain denomination believed (think more conservative than Southern Baptist).", "Yes, it's Matthew 7:3-5 and the ironic thing is her aunt is still saved if she truly repented, but living in sin will bring you straight to hell", "Matthew 3:28-29\n\n> Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit **will never be forgiven**; they are guilty of an eternal sin.\u201d", "> When she made that comment was she passive aggressive or not.\n\nTelling someone they are going to hell is never \"passive-aggressive\".  It is just plain aggressive.", "> you tell me a murder can repint but someone who just calls god a name when there mad is unforgivable?\n\nThat's not what OP's cousin did, according to the story.  She willfully and deliberately committed the one sin that she and the family believe Jesus said is unforgivable, and she did it many times.\n\nMatthew 3:28-29\n\n> Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.\u201d\n\nTheir church is definitely TA, but no one should pretend that the Bible doesn't have Jesus saying this.", "They get this idea from what Jesus supposedly said in Matthew 3:28-29:\n\n> Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.\u201d", "I'm assuming you haven't read the Bible?", "Look into [Eternal Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_sin).", "It\u2019s Matthew 12 : 31 - 32 in context the Pharisees are saying Jesus is doing miracles by the power of the devil and he says that\u2019s not the case and to suggest that is blaspheming the holy spirit which would never be forgiven. It doesn\u2019t really specify exactly what blaspheming the Holy Spirit is beyond this, so it\u2019s usefulness to you in challenging peoples behaviour may vary.", "Checking Wikipedia, it seems like the only unforgivable sin is refusal to repent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal\\_sin", "Yes I understand that. But their interpretation of it is kinda mind boggling to me. The cousin clearly hasn\u2019t turned her back on God.  Not going to debate the Bible though, if that is how they choose to live, power to them.", "> What\u2019s actually a sin is \u201cblasphemy against the Holy Spirit\u201d but what it means is a constant hardening of your heart against the Holy Spirit\n\nIt reads like that's exactly what OP's cousin did.\n\n> She intentionally (as in, she looked up the worst thing she could do) committed the one unforgivable sin (blasphemy against the holy spirit, look it up if you want) almost daily.", "Brilliant!!!!", "I also don\u2019t understand this reply so idk maybe this is on me but it seems other people in the comments were confused as well.", "Oh my bad, sorry", "Why do you say she's \"going to hell no matter what\"?

She\u2019s condemned for life. Her soul will be in the eternal flames of hell. It is good to remind her of it. She needs to know daily that she is never going to be saved.

Love the way you handled this, tbh.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I wish more people would put \"believers\" on notice like you did when they fail to recognize just how shitty they're being by refusing to perform basic respect towards others or respect a basic boundary. It's especially infuriating when someone who claims to be devout is several levels of unrepentantly sinful, but they've decided your particular brand of sin is somehow worse and more worthy of discussion than their own.", "NTA  Any time some devout Christian says an unbeliever is going to hell, they are deliberately trying to scare the unbeliever.  She got a taste of her own medicine. They need to quit cherry picking the bible too.  \n\nWas this all based on the King James version of the bible?  You remember King James don't you?  Elizabeth 1's heir who was a known homosexual?", "Brother it\u2019s her religious beliefs. If you\u2019re so opposed to it then don\u2019t engage in a discussion. \n\nDon\u2019t tell her she\u2019s going to hell. \n\nI share your view but YTA.", "YTA. I'm sorry, but really you overstepped. You had every right to argue with her, to set boundaries, whatever - but if she already believes she's going to hell and there is nothing she can do about it, rubbing it in is extremely cruel. And I don't know whether you can do anything to make it up to her, to make her feel better.", " Never feel bad for calling out bigots", "Yeah, my understanding of it is that you have to have basically seen God (or Christ), believed and had a sure knowledge of His existence, and THEN went and denied it.  There\u2019s no way she would have actually been able to commit this sin so..yeah.  This particular sin is pretty much reserved for like, high up church leaderships.  \n\nAnd honestly, this whole argument is just ridiculous.  ESH", "I have started telling hypocritical Christians that by casting judgement they are going on a one way road to hell. God in the bible says to leave judgement to him and love everyone. Jesus even hung out with the \"undesirables\"/ \"sinners\" so... Hell it is!", "Who cares. The thing is she believes it and she got what she deserved. lol", "Oh and you are qualified?! Pffft!", "Probably just the Mark of the Beast.", "She\u2019s unforgivable   She\u2019s burning already. A shell of a soul.", "I was raised very Catholic and have no idea what OP's cousin did.", "I think people are just curious what sect she is in that blaspheming is unforgivable...because it isn't protestantism, Catholicism, or Eastern Orthodoxy, at least not the mainline versions. What is she? Is this a Jehovah's Witness thing, maybe?", "I never said I was qualified. I said they were not qualified. Jesus Christ is the only one qualified to judge us all. He lived a sinless life and loved us enough to take upon him our sins on the condition that we repent. In the end it doesn't matter what you think or what you believe. Every knee will bow and every tongue confess the He is the Christ. I'm not sure how you came to the conclusion that I felt that I was qualified to judge them. That's not at all what I said or even eluded to.", "Your assumption about me is false :) I have most definitely read the Bible, many times in fact! My understanding of it, and of God has evolved tremendously over the years which is why I now fully believe they are interpreting this verse incorrectly and to their own mental detriment. But again, no judgement, only love.", "Blasphemer!", "Amen sister! Amen!  Keep preaching and reach all the souls out there. The sooner you do the sooner he rapture occurs.", "It\u2019s actually a contentious issue and doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. For some it\u2019s any use of \u201cGod\u201d that isn\u2019t being used directly to praise him. For others it\u2019s swearing using his name, like goddammit or oh my god (non-worshipful, since you *can* say this in a religious way) for some less strict, it\u2019s using God\u2019s real name, which\u2026 well, he has a few. Depends on your flavour of beliefs what that name is. Most well known probably is Jehovah, by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, who absolutely love to say their God\u2019s name in a respectful way, but never as swearing. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s all over the place. Different people have different answers. Some people are even so strict that euphemisms that are *replacements* for saying the lord\u2019s name are unacceptable like saying Cheese and Crackers! Instead of Jesus Christ! Is still a big no-no. \n\nReligion is weird and fascinating. (And imo BS)", "Except she literally came back from it. Once you do, bam. Forgiven. It\u2019s a non-sin. A Christian *can\u2019t*, by definition, commit it, because then they aren\u2019t Christian, they have rejected the Holy Spirit. An atheist doesn\u2019t believe in the concept of sin, so by \u201crejecting\u201d Christianity, they don\u2019t incur any sin in their own belief. It\u2019s a zero-sum sin. It\u2019s merely an accusation for Christians to throw at each other or at outsiders to try and convince them to come believe in Jesus so they don\u2019t get thrown in the furnace after death.", "I mean, I get that you and all Christians believe, but my point still stands. \n\n\u201cBlasphemy against the Holy Spirit\u201d is a non-sin. Christians *can\u2019t* commit it and still *be* Christians. The only way to commit it is by excluding yourself from the group that believes in the concept of sin to begin with, at which point it no longer matters to oneself. And it should *only* matter to oneself, because according to Christianity only God has the right to judge the sins of man. No mortal man can judge another man\u2019s sins. \n\nTherefore it\u2019s a non-sin. Those that believe in it can\u2019t be guilty of it, nor can they accuse others of it.", "It always seemed logical because you have to have a conscious will to be able to repent your sins. Once you\u2019re dead it just seems like you\u2019re judged based upon the actions you took while living. If you ended your life by your own hand you didn\u2019t have time to repent that act while still in the portion of existence where you had a chance to be sorry. I\u2019m not saying this is at all theologically correct, just that it made sense to a young girl in Sunday School. \n\nNow the part where Jesus could forgive even systematic child molestation, that\u2019s why the young girl left the church and realized that pretty much all religions are pretty full of holes and flaws and took to atheism."]}
