She shouldn't hammer on you and you went over the line into ah territory.", "It's completely understandable that you were hurt by your cousin's comments and felt the need to defend yourself. Discussions surrounding personal beliefs and lifestyles can be challenging, especially when individuals have strongly opposing views. While it seems clear that you and your cousin have very different perspectives on these issues, it's essential for each of you to express your beliefs respectfully and empathetically, mindful of the fact that you're family and need to coexist harmoniously.\r  \n\r  \nYour cousin's comments were inappropriate and dismissive of your identity. The anger and hurt you felt in response is justified. However, responding with harsh words and past mistakes can escalate the situation further and strain relationships, as we've seen in this instance.\r  \n\r  \nThe goal should ideally be promoting understanding and respect for each other's identities and beliefs, even if you fundamentally disagree. Such a conversation can be tough, particularly in the heat of the moment, but it's often more productive and less likely to cause lasting harm.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your response may have been disproportionate, your frustration is understandable. A more balanced approach in the future could be to tell her how her words hurt you, to express your need for her to respect your identity, and to reinforce the importance of not letting religious disagreements become personal attacks.\r  \n\r  \nYour cousin also needs to understand the impact of her words. Maybe engaging her in a calm, non-confrontational conversation about how her comments affected you could help both of you understand each other better.\r  \n\r  \n**In summary, you're not the asshole** for feeling hurt and wanting to defend yourself. **However**, the way you chose to react might not have been the most constructive approach for maintaining family harmony. It's clear that this is a complex situation that may require ongoing dialogue and understanding from all involved.", "Honesty, YTA but like did you really not want to be an asshole in that situation?

Where if you accept Jesus as your saviour and repent your sins etc, you will be forgiven because without that.. there really is no point trying to fix anything because you will never be forgiven.  So you might as well make it worth your while.\n\nYour aunt was completely in the wrong with what she said to you but you dragged yourself down to her level by saying what you said.", "Just tell her when you're in heaven, you will ask God for her to be your maid or something..

When she made that comment was she passive aggressive or not. Because if she was, she is TA. As a Cristian our biggest belief is to love others, No matter our differences. \n\nThat being said, she might have just been trying to help. From her perspective, she was a sinner and converting back to Christianity was the best thing for her. Maybe she wants the same thing for you. \n\nI feel like more context is needed for this. Was she trying to cause a scene to publicly shame you?

I won't get into if you are in the right or the wrong, but your intention was to be TA so wear it with pride!", "Both people overstepped she defintly should not have said what she said, she needs to respect your orinatation and imo if god is the loving god everyone tells me he/she is then he would love them the same as anyone else and hold them to the same standards as everyone else.  \n\n\nAlso actions she said when she was young and dumb would damn her to hell, you tell me a murder can repint but someone who just calls god a name when there mad is unforgivable?    \n\n\nTA is really the church that feed these crap to people, I choose to believe in a god but I don't want what there trying to sell", "NTA - her sin was a CHOICE !!!!           \nYour sin (not an actual sin in my book) is who you are.          \nShe can\u2019t tell you that you are going to hell and expect you to not tell her the same.", "I can-not STAND Christianity and all that religious claptrap and all the two-facedness that goes with it.\n\nWoman vicar runs off with married parishioner ''God told me to do it''\n\nMonk molests choir boy  ''Jesus came to me in a dream and told me to do it''\n\nAll the sexism, racism, homophobia, all the ''You'll burn in hell because you're so poor you're living in a cardboard box on the streets''\n\n''We hate you because you're gay so you'll be rotting in hell'' crap.\n\nYou did perfectly by poking her in the eye!

That\u2019s her problem.", "NTA: If she didn't want to discuss the ramifications of actions in regards to her sincerely held religious beliefs, she should have paid a little closer attention to words of Jesus in John 8:7 (he who is without sin blah blah blah). There is an occasional thing that happens in courts (but every other episode of court dramas) where something about a persons past can't be brought up by the opposition but if they bring it up themselves it becomes fair game to ask about. Yeah, your cousin opened a door and then got angry when you walked through it.", "I think you're being overly generous thinking she was speaking out of love and not holier-than-thou self righteousness trying to 'save' you for boosting her own ego and prejudices, tbh.   \nNTA", "NTA.

One. \n\n\u201cBlasphemy against the Holy Spirit\u201d is a euphemism for basically closing your heart to God, or simply put, not being Christian.

But even then, there is still the backstop of repentance if you can't reach a priest.", "But what does that mean?", "How is that logical? It's not about the living forgiving sins is it?\nIt's about Jesus or God forgiving you.", "That\u2019s so strange. Excommunication isn\u2019t just given out wily-nily but has to go through a canonical court. The Catholic Church is heavily hierarchical and one town can\u2019t just make up rules\u2026 so very weird to me", "Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is when you take the true work of the Holy Spirit and you speak evil of it, attributing his work to the devil.
