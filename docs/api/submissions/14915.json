I don't know enough about IVF to say whether she's correct about differences in early births etc or not, but you're not an AH for offering advice/comparisons if she hasn't said anything previously and she's not an AH for rejecting that advice due to nervousness and general worries. Unsolicited advice can be taken badly in even the best of situations, I would tone down the comparisons and try not to take it personally.", "NAH from what I can tell.\n\nYou're just trying to be supportive and she seems to be not appreciating the way you present it and compare (even though you're coming from a place of love). Maybe try other ways to support her?", "Soft YTA\n\nShe's right, your pregnancies are not the same.\n\nNot just because of how/when they happened, or even that you are two vastly different people with different bodies... but also because every pregnancy IS different.\n\nWhat is normal for one might not be normal for another. I mean, my best friend told me a story of her being 8 months pregnant and no one believing she was pregnant.", "INFO: How old is your pregnant sister? How old were you when you gave birth? How many times have you compared your pregnancies? \n\nIt\u2019s potentially very different, and regardless of AH status right now she\u2019s stressed and hormonal and she needs her sister to be supportive not comparative.", "NAH. I was going to say N-T-A, but cut her some slack about due to hormones and first-pregnancy wonderings. But now you know, she doesn\u2019t want you to commiserate or reassure her; she just wants you to listen.", "YTA. It would be N A H until she respectfully voiced her discomfort to you and you argued and tried to defend yourself. You should have accepted what she said and apologized that you had been unknowingly hurting her.", "Soft YTA because you mean well.\n\nYour sister is in a scary, hormonal place. She kindly told you to cool it on the comparisons. Instead of defending yourself, you should\u2019ve just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m making you feel worse by trying to make you feel better. I\u2019ll cool it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not psychic, but I very clearly see this repeating itself when she\u2019s having challenges with her newborn, toddler, etc. You\u2019ll want to help her, but she may not want your advice.", "NTA She told you to stop comparing pregnancies. If she has concerns, she should call her doctor, but you will be the AH if you disrespect her wishes. Your pregnancies are not the same, and she's not asking you to minimize her concerns.", "I don't think any of you are TA imo. She is very nervous and most likely scared and you obviously wanted to show support by saying you've experienced like-wise symptoms when you carried your baby. Don't offer any more of those comments. Just let her verbally express herself and you show support the best way you can without mentioning your young pregnancy. \n\nNAH...", "I really think she\u2019s being sensitive.

Sounds like a straightforward misunderstanding. \n\nYou're trying to validate her feelings, and she thinks you're dismissing them. \n\nSounds like what she needs is a different type of validation.  \"Oh jeez, that sounds like an awful way to start your day!\" and the like.", "NTA you are recounting your own experience to reassure her about her symptoms, and help reduce her anxiety. You are not trying get into a pissing contest about the difficulties of your different pregnancies. Only a doctor would be able to tell her for sure, but more likely than not, they are Braxton hicks contractions, and are perfectly normal.", "NTA. But I understand where your sister is coming from. It honestly has nothing to do with IVF, though that\u2019s what she is saying. Once that zygote has implanted, it\u2019s no different than the old fashioned fertilization. Just understand that for marginalized people, and yes, lesbians and even others who rely on IVF are marginalized, sometimes even well-meaning communications carry a different weight. You\u2019re okay.\nJust listen to what she is asking for and accept that is her journey.", "NAH she's hormonal & thinks you had it \"easy\" because you didn't have to buy your kid. She prob just feels insecure since you didn't have to use IVF.\n\n\n infertility in people who want children can really really fuck with their mental health. I've seen it several times. It's been wild every time. Some pregnant people want to be the only pregnant people ever too. I'd just stop saying anything at all when she says stuff about her pregnancy. If she doesn't like that you can just tell her you're trying to respect her wishes & not talk about things you \"don't understand\"", "NTA she\u2019s really sensitive about the IVF. Just take note to stop talking about your experience let her vent. She\u2019s uncomfortable and hormonal.", "NAH you are clearly only trying to be helpful and calming.\n\nI\u2019ll admit though it was nearly a NTA because it seems like it\u2019s Very important for your sister that she is Completely unique here, which is ridiculous at best with the thousands if not millions of women who\u2019s pregnant and/or giving birth right this moment.", "NTA. \n\nI conceived via IVF. And once I was pregnant and carrying past first trimester I was treated exactly the same as any other pregnant person. \n\nIt\u2019s true every pregnancy is different but there\u2019s enough similarity for general empathy and sharing. \n\nSounds like your sister is extra anxious as conceiving via IVF is freaking tough emotionally and I didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d have a baby until she was in my arms. So yeah she\u2019s sensitive. But that doesn\u2019t make you looking to reassure her wrong.", "NTA lmfao", "No. Her hormones and her emotions have blown this out of proportion. This isn\u2019t an asshole situation.", "IVF has nothing to do with this. What your sister is experiencing is Braxton Hicks Contractions. This is normal at her stage of pregnancy.

Not done told that every person who has nirtnes a child went through this. It sounds like with the early contractions thing, you are trying to reassure her that it doesn't necessarily mean her bub will be premmie. But it sounds like you have been minimising or talking about your pregnancy the whole way through, so this comes off as yet again making it about you", "NAH. Based on your post it seemed to me like you were trying to be reassuring when you reference your experience. That her symptoms and experiences are normal. That  you know how she feels because you have experience pregnancy before. However sometimes peole just want to vent. They want to express their fear, pain or frustration. They don't want advice or reasurrance. They just want someone to listen. So moving forward just listen and only express an opinion/give advice/reassurance if she expressly ask for it.
