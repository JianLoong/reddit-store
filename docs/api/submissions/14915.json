Not you 26 years ago", "When I was about 7 months pregnant and measurable my husband was trying to cheer me up by telling me jokes. He just kept talking and talking and talking and the most loving way. I was able to stop him in the moment and was to tell him that I \"Couldn't take the full production of his personality\".\n\nI swear I really meant it to sound nicer than it came off and even in the moment he thought it was funny and realized he was doing too much. Now it's our favorite thing to say to each other.", "Actually that's not true. Getting pregnant through IVF does carry higher risks.", "I can see your point, but at the same time this is a very common miscommunication in a general sense. There's some people who think that relating a personal connected experience is rude and making it about the person doing the relating, and there are others who think that relating their experience is a way of connecting and showing camaraderie like \"I've been here before and I'm here for you\". It's a pretty well known situation.", "It sounds to me like she's having Braxton hicks. They're perfectly normal at her stage and are a way for the body to prepare for actual labor. For a first time mom they can be scary. She should be talking to her obgyn about them so they can ease her fear. NAH in my opinion", "I think it's fair to straight up ask the question \"do you want advice or do you just want to vent?\"", "\u201cI\u2019ve been there before\u201d is not at all a reasonable thing for pregnancy experiences. My first pregnancy was before my sister\u2019s last one. But me responding to her difficulties with \u201cyeah, I was pregnant too\u201d would be incredibly dismissive of the fact that her struggles and mine are not at all the same.", "To be clear, I didn't mean saying \"I've been pregnant too\" in that exact way was OK. I was more talking about \"I had X during my pregnancy\" with the unspoken (and missed due to the miscommunication) part being \"and because of that I understand that it's difficult and want to be here for you\".", "When someone tells you something like \u201cI\u2019m scared because I\u2019m having contractions way too early\u201d, the answer is never \u201cI had contractions and everything turned out great for me!\u201d"]}
