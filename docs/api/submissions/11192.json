Kaylee had recently visited our other friend, Dana, for Dana's going-away party. I asked how the party went, and she got to talking about Dana's wacky family. Dana's stepdad came up. I mentioned that I wasn't a fan, as Gabe is the kind of person that makes harmless \"jokes\" - and then asks why people can't take a joke/grow thicker skin when they find it offensive. \n\nI told the story about the time Dana and I had met up, and my car wouldn't work as we were trying to get home. We ended up getting it to Dana's house so Gabe could take a look. He ran through his usual gamut of misogynistic comments - this time, about women not being able to fix their cars (even though neither he, nor the mechanic we called, could figure out the issue). \n\nAt this point in the story, my bf interjects to say \"you were a little girl, of course you couldn't fix it.\"\n\nI couldn't come up with much of a response besides a half-joking \"what the fuck did you just say??\" before moving on.\n\nI brought it up today and asked him not to call me a little girl, especially in front of others. We have pet names for each other, and I don't mind the cutesy things he calls me when we're on our own - but I've asked him before not to address me that way in public. BF got upset and said we weren't in public, but with friends. He then began to explain to me that, as I was in fact a 'little girl' at the time of the story, that he had simply been stating facts. I told him that no one refers to a college junior as little girl.\n\nThis is where things took an exponentially heated turn, as my BF started to raise his voice and tell me that if \"someone is a little girl, then I'm going to refer to them as little girl. What do you think I should call a five-year-old??\" I said a college-age student was not the same thing, and he said it basically is.\n\nI was trying to explain to him why calling me a little girl, as well as using that as justification of why I obviously wouldn't be able to fix my own car, was blatantly sexist. He said many women were never taught to repair cars, and boys are more likely to have been taught. I replied that while that might be true, the way he said it was still hurtful. He replied that people that were offended by the phrase 'little girl' (and his comment on women generally knowing less about cars) were \"pussies.\" \n\nI'm on the verge of tears as I try to ask him why he has such a hard time referring to people in the manner they prefer. He said it was stupid, and wouldn't let me get another word in by talking loudly over me. Said he'd had it and was going to bed - but came back to say \"this is the level of weak and sensitive stuff with you that I just can't take.\" \n\nI know I can be a sensitive person, and it's something I try  hard to be aware of. \n\nAITA?
