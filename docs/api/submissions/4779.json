{"id": 4779, "submission_id": "zmka7d", "title": "AITA for exposing my coworker's bathroom habits?", "selftext": "I (25F) work at a smaller company of about 15 people. I get along with pretty much everyone with the exception of someone we'll call Alexis (40F). Alexis is very socially conservative and I am not. I do my best to not talk about things I know will cause an argument, but they sometimes happen anyway. \n\nOne time I used the bathroom right after the cleaning crew finished cleaning it and didn't bother putting the toilet seat down because I was just going to squat to pee. I washed my hands and when I exited, I bumped straight into Alexis. I apologized and went on with my day. \n\nFor the next two weeks, I thought Alexis was being particularly sanctimonious, but I didn't say anything as it wasn't too out of character. The subject of women's sports came up during lunch and she made a snide comment along the lines of, \"People like OP ruin them for everyone else.\" \n\nI'm immediately confused. I\u2019ve never been athletically inclined at any age, so ask, \"Do you mean tall people?\" \n\n\"No, 'women' that are still biologically men,\" she says with a glare. \n\nAt the time, this came out of left field. I am a cisgender woman. While I am still a tomboy in my interests, I am very physically feminine presenting. I said, \"Okay, one: There is nothing wrong with being transgender. Two: I am not transgender. Why would you even say that?\" \n\n\"You can't fool me. I saw you come out of the bathroom and the toilet seat was UP.\" I stared in disbelief as she seemed convinced this was the biggest \"gotcha\" moment. She couldn't even hide her smug smile. \n\n\"I squatted, Alexis.\" The energy of the room was getting very awkward, so I decided to make a joke. \"Are you telling me that you park your bare ass on the toilet seat in public restrooms?\" \n\nShe turned bright red. Apparently she did, because she started muttering something about \"not being weird\" before bursting into tears and leaving the room. \n\nMy coworkers think it was rude of me to \"expose\" her like that, but I don't think I did anything wrong for trying to defuse a situation she put herself in. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'd like to address a few things. 1. A lot of you mentioned going to HR. I wasn't going to because I thought I would get in trouble too, but if I had been trans, this story could have ended very differently. I'm going to arrange a meeting. 2. I hear you all loud and clear about squatting vs sitting. Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with OCD in the height of the pandemic and many of my delusions are centered around germs and contamination. I'm gonna work on that, but sitting may not be in my future. At the very least, I'm going to look into pelvic floor exercises so I don't end up incontinent at 40. 3. A lot of you think this is fake, and considering that a majority of shit on Reddit never happened, I don't blame you. I was a professional fiction writer for awhile and I try to make what I write at least a little bit interesting to read, so my style may be throwing you off. If I did make this up, I probably would have had at least one coworker in solidarity with me and, I don't know, maybe I did volleyball in high school? I'm a very lame protagonist.", "created_utc": 1671108501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmka7d/aita_for_exposing_my_coworkers_bathroom_habits/", "score": 7111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get along with pretty much everyone with the exception of someone we'll call Alexis (40F). Alexis is very socially conservative and I am not. I do my best to not talk about things I know will cause an argument, but they sometimes happen anyway. \n\nOne time I used the bathroom right after the cleaning crew finished cleaning it and didn't bother putting the toilet seat down because I was just going to squat to pee. I washed my hands and when I exited, I bumped straight into Alexis. I apologized and went on with my day. \n\nFor the next two weeks, I thought Alexis was being particularly sanctimonious, but I didn't say anything as it wasn't too out of character. The subject of women's sports came up during lunch and she made a snide comment along the lines of, \"People like OP ruin them for everyone else.\" \n\nI'm immediately confused. I\u2019ve never been athletically inclined at any age, so ask, \"Do you mean tall people?\" \n\n\"No, 'women' that are still biologically men,\" she says with a glare. \n\nAt the time, this came out of left field. I am a cisgender woman. While I am still a tomboy in my interests, I am very physically feminine presenting. I said, \"Okay, one: There is nothing wrong with being transgender. Two: I am not transgender. Why would you even say that?\" \n\n\"You can't fool me. I saw you come out of the bathroom and the toilet seat was UP.\" I stared in disbelief as she seemed convinced this was the biggest \"gotcha\" moment. She couldn't even hide her smug smile. \n\n\"I squatted, Alexis.\" The energy of the room was getting very awkward, so I decided to make a joke. \"Are you telling me that you park your bare ass on the toilet seat in public restrooms?\" \n\nShe turned bright red. Apparently she did, because she started muttering something about \"not being weird\" before bursting into tears and leaving the room. \n\nMy coworkers think it was rude of me to \"expose\" her like that, but I don't think I did anything wrong for trying to defuse a situation she put herself in.

If it looks gross I'll hold it or use a paper liner, but for the same I get why some may be the extreme opposite.", "Smart squatters put a thin layer of toilet paper in the water before peeing. It prevents back splash.", "Yeah - I was thinking this too.  I\u2019m pretty sure all those women\u2019s room toilet seats covered in pee are from squatters.\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to put the seat down and wipe off the seat of you are that worried about it.", "I see you\u2019ve met my ex\u2026", "I\u2019ve been a lot of different countries and I can honestly say the only place I have seen have seat covers is the USA or places that are very much catering to US tourist.", "There are gross places to sit and pee, but most places I do sit and pee.  I wonder what OP does if she has to poo?", "Wait you get drips on the seat even while sitting? How?? Or are you saying you don\u2019t wipe after you pee\u2026? I\u2019m confused by your comment about urinary health if your stream is wild enough to splatter while seated\u2026 yes everyone should wipe off any splatter regardless of their position, but the only splatter if you sit should be from the flush\u2026", "These literally 0 harm in sitting on a toilet seat. Unless there's literally shit or blood smeared on it", "Splashback is higher", "I don\u2019t have these experiences\u2026 I guess I always look at the toilet. And it\u2019s rarely covered like everyone is saying. I\u2019ve seen it for sure, but people are acting like it\u2019s more often than not.", "In my dorms a bunch of people got rashes on their asses from the cleaning agent. I'm on the team for laying down TP or a seat cover.", "Seriously, if someone accused me of that I would be shocked and probably laugh and say \"of course! What, you don't!?\"\n\nBut then I also wouldn't assume someone who left the seat up was trans. Or even that they used it with the seat up necessarily. Idk why you'd need to lift it after doing your business, but that's their business, not mine. And even if I did somehow come to some conclusion after that incident, there's no way I'd say something publicly.\n\nBut there's no way I'd be embarrassed that I sit on toilet seats. That's literally what they're made for...", "there's splashback? I don't think I have ever done a wee and had splashback.", "I usually spread my labia across the toilet seat before I sit.", "My coworker calls these people \"splatterpusses\".", "I don't care if you're inches or feet above the seat. If there's piss on the seat when you're done, you did it wrong. What's the harm in asking squatters to lift the seat first? It's not like they're using it and they *do* consistently get piss on the seat no matter how skillful they think they are at hovering.", "From one person exploring their gender \\[kinda\\] to another, I'm really happy you found somewhere awesome that looks out for you! As long as you can make enough for a halfway-decent living, everything other dollar is unnecessary if you have to sacrifice yourself for it. I'm actually kinda tearing up right now to know that you're doing well...? It's weirdly validating to know that not only do others feel like me, that there's a space for them.\n\nI hope you have a kickass week, dude. Stay safe out there, and know that there's a ~~big-titty~~ internet stranger hug for ya if need be.", "Bursting into tears?\n\nWhat happened next, everyone applauded?\n\nYTA for telling lies on the internet.", "NTA.\n\nPlease go to HR because she was openly transphobic.", "right? like how was OPs bare ass statement considered more \"exposing\" than \"I saw you left the toilet seat up so must be a man\"", "The only time I would squat is if the toilet seat was really gross and I had no other options. I don\u2019t see a problem with sitting but it has to have a seat cover. I took a microbiology class last semester and we went into the bathroom and swabbed different areas in the bathroom like the stall handle, toilet seat (the part where you sit on directly), and the sink handles and all of it was infected with E. Coli. It was truly disgusting.", "I question your judgment if you think these two transgressions are remotely on the same plane.\n\nOP is likely (unintentionally) contributing to dirtiness in the restroom... which you yourself say can be easily cleaned, and is not likely to cause anyone any real harm, just annoyance and disgust. And in the situation that we are SUPPOSED to be analyzing, it isn't even the reason the other party was upset, so how is it relevant to the judgment? None of her coworkers are saying she's an asshole for leaving pee spots, they're saying she's an asshole for making her attempted harasser cry.\n\nThe coworker INTENTIONALLY tried to out someone as a trans woman to a good amount of coworkers in a conservative area. That is hate crime territory, and can easily result in firing, harassment, and/or violence. It's not comparable to getting pee droplets on the floor. OP is misguided and a bit irrational, but the coworker is a grade A jerk. NTA", "I\u2019m not knowledgeable about this squatting to pee damaging you thing, but people have used squat toilets for a long time in many places and squatting in the bushes was a thing since prehistory.  Does the shape of a western toilet make squatting more harmful, or have people been harming themselves for eons squatting to pee?", "Google DARVO", "No. It is normal.", "But she wouldn't get in trouble for trying to talk about your penis?", "It's also a bad idea to hover bc it increases the risk of developing pelvic floor and urinary issues long term, which are already common in women. This includes such things as incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. It's far safer for your health to sit, so thank your joints for at least helping with that if nothing else lol!", "I\u2019ll hover and leave it if the seat\u2019s gross in a public restroom, but if it\u2019s clean and in the rare times I get a drop on it, I wipe like a CIVILIZED person.\n\nAs my mom once told me as a child \u201cif you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be neat and wipe the seat.\u201d", "It's about the western toilet. It makes us hover at a high angle, which internally doesn't let our muscles do things the normal way, so to say. \n\nI'm not a pelvic floor expert so I'd rather not act like I know all the technicalities, but Google has plenty of info about why hovering over western toilets is bad, but squatting positions, like the ones in certain types of toilets that can be found in certain places of Asia, is actually good.", " I hate these people. Your toilet habits are your own business", "My older sister went hard-core Darvo on me before our relationship ended.  Every conversation was her telling me how to live and becoming deeply offended when I said things like, you live your life and I will live mine.  I tried so hard to be diplomatic and understanding.  I worked so hard not to offend her.  In the end being my own person was the real offense so our relationship ended.", "Actually, I was just making a play on your flair \ud83d\ude05", "As guns and roses said, \"live and let piss\".

I even had a nurse espouse that nonsense.

Even if you did all that chances aren\u2019t great.", "Dude when I hover, I rarely get piss on the seat. If I do, then I wipe it with tp because I'm not an animal. Good bathroom etiquette is easy.", "I also don't like having to clean up other people's pee.", "I have bad knees, I've had bad knees since I was a teenager. There's no such thing as squatting to pee for me. People are just fucking inconsiderate.", "Dumbo over here.", "When you squat all the way down your pelvic floor can relax. When you squat partway down your pelvic floor has to be tensed to hold you in position. That means you have to push the pee past the tension in your pelvic floor which over time can lead to issues with incomplete emptying, increasing the risk of incontinence and UTIs. It also can led to a weakened pelvic floor, increasing your risk of pelvic organ prolapse, where your uterus or bladder aren't held up by your pelvic floor muscles anymore so they start more or less falling out your vaginal opening. It's really not healthy to hover to pee, or push to pee or poop. Squatting all the way is absolutely the best way to do it, unfortunately that's not at all common in the western hemisphere.", "Don't use flushable wipes. They aren't flushable.", "It\u2019s always a good day to learn.  When I was wondering whether the issue was the shape of toilets, I didn\u2019t think of their height.", "This is going to be TMI, but... \n\nInstead of squatting by bending your knees halfway with your torso up, lean forwards and place your elbows over your knees or thighs. Your torso and thighs making a 90 degree angle, and knees slightly bent. Your muscles in the pelvic floor will be able to relax, plus you'll have much better aim.", "I cackled out loud. Thanks for that", "So you're complaining about people who drip and don't wipe, not hoverers.", "I would bet my life savings that  there's way more women getting piss on the seat from hovering than from sitting & not wiping (assuming toilet paper is available of course).", "She's horrible, and also, most cis-women sit when we pee.", "I had a coworker at a hotel who cried and left work early on her last day because when I got on shift my boss called me into her office and we were chatting for a while. She was upset because I didn\u2019t immediately come find her to say goodbye.. I know this because she told our boss this on her way out. People are weird!", "Honestly, a public toilet seat is not that dirty. It's touching skin that spends 99% of its day inside your clothes. Your hands are 100x dirtier than the skin of your thighs and butt.", ">Who's rubbing their actual crack on a toilet seat?\n\nI'm sure SOMEONE is. Ppl can be filthy.

Not taking that chance again, gotta clean that toilet afterwards, fine but no one will get me to sit down ever again.", "This is true. My office provides seat covers and most women use them. It\u2019s the pig squatters who pee all over the seat and don\u2019t wipe up after themselves that\u2019s the problem. I read somewhere that squatting is actually bad for you.", "Ugh! You\u2019re probably right \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude29", "It's still very, very bad for your pelvic floor. Your body is meant to use the washroom in a full squat, but a hovering squat requires you to tighten a bunch of muscles that are not meant to be tight while you use the washroom. You may not even be conscious of this subtle difference in muscle use, but over time the habit can change the mechanics of how you urinate and can cause pelvic floor disfunction.", "I also took a microbiology class and we did the same thing. Unfortunately the girl who swabbed on the toilet seat did find E. Coli and that\u2019s why I always use a seat cover."]}
