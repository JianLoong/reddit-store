Whose idea was getting engaged already- especially since it does not sound like you have even lived together?\n\nI go with not enough info to make judgment", "Sometimes parents have valid reasons not to like a significant other that go past the person with the rose colored glasses.

Do the parents recognize some behaviors in him that they don\u2019t like toward her? Do they see parallels to her previous relationship?"]}
