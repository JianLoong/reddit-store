{"id": 30363, "submission_id": "17ochwy", "title": "AITA for refusing to adhere to my SIL\u2019s Christmas gift list?", "selftext": "For Christmas, my (30f) husband (30m) and I are hosting my parents, my brother Chris (34m), his wife Amy (33f), their two sons (6&4), my sister Lucia (27m), and her boyfriend Alex (30m). \n\nThe background to all this is that Amy complains about every gift she is given by any of us. Every Christmas she makes faces and snide remarks about the things she\u2019s gifted. For example, last year we (me and my husband) gifted Amy and Chris a joint present of an expensive coffee maker, which is the same one we have at home that Chris loved when they visited. Amy\u2019s only remark - not even a thank you - was \u201coh well this isn\u2019t really for me is it\u201d, and then to make a great show of being annoyed that she didn\u2019t get a separate gift. \n\nA few days ago, Amy included the whole family on a group email with a Christmas list for her and the kids, saying that she would only accept gifts from this list. On her list was expensive perfumes, links to expensive clothing items, and designer handbags. I was livid. My parents were offended as well but didn\u2019t want to say anything to Amy but I wasn\u2019t going to hold back in the face of what I felt was grossly entitled behaviour.\n\nI replied to Amy\u2019s email saying I wouldn\u2019t be purchasing anything on that list and that if she wanted to shop for a Louis Vuitton wallet I was happy to put her in touch with my saleswoman. I also said that if she didn\u2019t like what she received for Christmas she was welcome to just leave it at my house. \n\nChris blew up at me saying Amy was just trying to make everything easier for everyone by giving suggestions. I disagree and told him I think Amy was just trying to find a sneaky way to get a few things she normally can\u2019t afford for free, which in my opinion is not in the spirit of Christmas and I think she\u2019s being extremely childish.\n\nMy parents think I shouldn\u2019t have said anything but Lucia says I absolutely should have because she wasn\u2019t going to be spending hundreds on Amy\u2019s Christmas list either. \n\nWas I the AH for not going along with it?\n\nEDIT: 1. For everyone asking, yes Amy drinks coffee and uses the coffee machine.\n\n2. No, she and Chris do not gift anyone anything of them value of the items on her list. Chris does the Christmas shopping and our family is it big on adult gifting, we buy big things for the kids but we tend to get each other things like Christmas hampers (for couples), jumpers, I bought my mum a teapot one year, things like that. Certainly nothing in the price range Amy put on her list.

Big fan of cigarettes, not of SPF. She takes it that I am making a dig at her age that they are old goats and she looked old.\n \nSecondly he took it as a dig he was a horny old goat because his previous wife was younger than her. I thought his previous wife was my mother. They\u2019d only been divorced 6 years.\n\nThirdly her mother thinks goats represent Satan and that Africans are depraved for eating them. Cue some mindblowing racism at length.\n\nFourthly my brother who had failed to get a gift loudly muscled in on seeing a gold envelope that he had contributed only to backtrack with \u2018how did you find something worse than the taxidermy frog mariachi band you bid on Ebay for?\u2019\n\nFifth: saying \u2018ah from the kids\u2019 went down really really badly when the other roughly 20 relatives of the blushing bride went \u2018oh you\u2019re his daughter? We didn\u2019t know he had a daughter. We thought you were an ex.\u2019 I was 25.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t even the most awkward bit of that wedding. We are now estranged and 18 years later the kids of the OG goats keep writing to them. My dad genuinely has more idea what his great great great times 18 grandgoats are doing than his only daughter. At this rate one of them will give his eulogy.\n\nI will never top this gift for fuck you, fuck this, FFS and some actual good to a family.
