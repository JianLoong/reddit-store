I was also just plotting around the garden and looking into my vege boxes to see what's growing. \n\nShe kept looking over at my son and then going back to work I watched her walk over to my fence and she started screaming how it's creepy my son watching her and I need to teach him from a young age not to stare at women or else he'll grow up and be a creep. I got up right away and grabbed my son and apologized and tried to say he's just curious what your doing but she kept screaming at me because she doesn't like to be watched. I scooped my son up who was crying at this point (what baby wouldn't cry being yelled at) and hurried to the back yard so he could play there. \n\nShe left while angerly muttering to herself about how I'm a bad mother and my son will soon be a creep. \n\nI'm now feeling really bad about letting my son watch her mow the lawn and maybe we shouldn't play I'm the front yard any more. \n \nSo am I asshole for letting my son sit and watch?", "created_utc": 1677370164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c02nv/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_letting_my_toddler/", "score": 1966, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's really hard being a teenage girl. A lot of missteps, hyper self conscious, etc. It's not a place to hammer down on what you think is logical. There's no need to feel bad about what happened- talk to her and her folks about how your son loves lawn mowing, how if she worked on a firetruck it's about the firetruck.

She obviously shouldn\u2019t have expressed herself that way - I mean, who gets anything from yelling at a baby?? - but it\u2019s not at all unreasonable for her to want to not be watched that intently.

Maybe babies in general creep her out. Who knows?!? Those are all valid feelings that she acted on poorly. I take this as her doing a bad job of setting a reasonable boundary.

I teach 15 year olds and often get all sorts of random flip outs like this without any clear trigger. Trauma and mental health challenges are a thing in 15 year olds that do not have the coping and conflict management skills to navigate difficult emotions and situations. TBH this May have absolutely nothing to do with and your kid. It may everything to do with an activated kid trying to self manage without the maturity or knowledge about how to do so. You have no idea what is bothering her and she may just be lashing out at you and your kid because you are there. I often need to take a breath or two with a smile (as difficult as it can be sometimes) and offer help or support while acknowledging their expressions. Don\u2019t back down from clear boundaries to protect you and your kid ( you are doing the best you can so go you) but alittle compassion might go a long way.

My son (2.5 yo) insists that his penis is a finger no matter how many times I correct him. Sometimes it\u2019s his \u2018peepee finger\u2019. He has zero concept of any other use for his penis. Also, he loves to watch the neighbor mow his lawn.", "She must get over herself. As a mum of a very small boy, I can guarantee he only had eyes for that mower.", "She's probably in a huff because she's been made to mow the lawn and looking for anyone to lash out at.", "Honestly I was more concerned that the girl was scared the lawnmower would launch a rock at the baby. Getting hit by one is no joke, you could lose an eye.", "It's not because \"those horrible cartoons\", it's because people are curious, especially when they are babies.", "Her mom is comfortable screaming at babies with witnesses around.

I recently moved to a western country from the Eastern part of the world and on the bus I saw a 2 year old child staring at me. I have young kids so I smiled and waved  , and the kid waved back. The mum (I assume) gave a nasty look . Fortunately I got out soon after that. Your comment made me wonder, is it wrong to have micro interactions with kids in public places  in western society?

I'm so sorry he got yelled at, NTA of course.\n\nMaybe if you left a card for the neighbor apologizing again and saying your kid is just curious about lawnmowers, it would give her another chance to think it through and maybe get some feedback from her family?

I say that to really drive home how bad I am at it as even in a very much social working environment I *still* can't do it. \n\nI also struggle with being watched and I dunno kids weird me out I'm always worried about upsetting them with my anxious weirdness. That said if a 1 year infant was watching me do some yard work and it was *really* bothering me I'd just politely ask the parent to please remove the child as I have my issues. No need to make it a thing. I'm pretty sure I'd just deal with it but if I really had to that would be the absolute furthest extent.

Believe me it happens.", "absolutely the internet. my moneys on tiktok specifically.", "Happy Cake Day!", "I don't think so .I am a girl around that age but I wouldn't have such a reaction. Most girls my age won't. There is some other issue with her .. maybe she is experiencing some harrasment or bullying that makes her conscious of staring. It is not the iNtErnEt.

For example, there was a female in her 20\u2019s on YouTube the other day who had been filming herself playing around with weights in the gym while others were obviously waiting to use the equipment and glancing her way every so often. As she began to put the weights up, it was obvious she was having trouble (mainly because she wouldn\u2019t put her phone down) so one guy asked if she needed or wanted some help. She began screaming that he was a pervert and creep who kept looking at her and then she couldn\u2019t believe he would ask if she needed help to put the weights away.  some of these young ladies just take it too far, it\u2019s becoming ridiculous, going so far as to blame males for all the problems in the world and seeing even innocent looks or comments as wrong.\n\nNTA OP, obviously. And neither was your son.", "Don't excuse her bad behavior, she needs to solve that herself. You can have mental problems or bad stuff happen in the past but need to take care of your own self first , not take it out on innocent people.

A cleaner using a floor polisher, a builder using a drill, a road worker with a digger. That\u2019s how kids learn about the world. Very strange for the 15yo to have such an emotional reaction.", "We need to raise awareness", "She also specifically said he wasn\u2019t watching her all the time, so he wasn\u2019t staring. \n\nAnd by all means, if a toddler makes you uncomfortable, scream at them. \ud83d\ude44", "The girl already yelled at op for allowing the baby to watch her.

Stop blaming others", "My 3yr old often likes to get his willy out (in the house not public) and often plays with it or says \"look Mummy, my willy\". They are just learning about their body. I checked with my health visitor and they told me it's completely normal, should be encouraged as how else do they learn. You don't want your child to be ashamed of their body. They don't understand sex, lust or even being inappropriate. They are still learning how to talk, their ABCs and even learning feelings. That 15yr is seriously projecting and that worries me, it's not a normal response.", "They are definitely excuses\u2014they may not be good or justifiable ones, but still excuses. Their excuse may not excuse them, but they should still excuse themselves from the situation when they\u2019re a poor excuse for a human.", "I agree because he\u2019s a toddler.

OP, it's not your responsibility to parent this girl, but if you're friendly with her family it might be worthwhile having a chat with her parents - both because she owes your little one an apology and because there may be something Not Good going on in her life that makes her this reactive.\n\n[Edited to fix autocorrect error]", "Haha, that reminded me of going to my dad's work as a little kid. Idk if it was bring your kid to work day or what, but I go a tour of the room where they made machines to assemble disk drives and got to look in the windows to the clean room where people had to wear those full coverage \"bunny suits\" while inside.
