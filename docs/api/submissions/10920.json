We live in a cul-de-sac so we can see everyone's front yard from ours. \n\nThe neighbors teenage daughter maybe around 15 years old comes out with her lawnmower and gets to work on her yard. (She lives dorectly across the street from us) My son loves watching the world go by, he often wathces the older kids play on the street and they always interact and say hi to him. So he runs to our fence with his little Juice box and sits down in front of the gate so he can watch her mow the lawn. He wasn't always watching her sometimes he'd just start picking the dandelions and throwing them around our yard but most of the time he'd just sit and watch quietly. \n\nI kept my eye on him because it's a low fence and I'd never let him play out front not supervised, I've read horror stories of parents letting there kids play put front and getting snatched. I was also just plotting around the garden and looking into my vege boxes to see what's growing. \n\nShe kept looking over at my son and then going back to work I watched her walk over to my fence and she started screaming how it's creepy my son watching her and I need to teach him from a young age not to stare at women or else he'll grow up and be a creep. I got up right away and grabbed my son and apologized and tried to say he's just curious what your doing but she kept screaming at me because she doesn't like to be watched. I scooped my son up who was crying at this point (what baby wouldn't cry being yelled at) and hurried to the back yard so he could play there. \n\nShe left while angerly muttering to herself about how I'm a bad mother and my son will soon be a creep. \n\nI'm now feeling really bad about letting my son watch her mow the lawn and maybe we shouldn't play I'm the front yard any more. \n \nSo am I asshole for letting my son sit and watch?", "created_utc": 1677370164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c02nv/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_letting_my_toddler/", "score": 832, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s likely already being sexualized by men much, much older than her.

Don\u2019t think too much into this.  Your child is simply curious and that\u2019s okay.  The neighbor kid is probably insecure and possibly mentally unstable like most kids that age.

Toddlers aren't looking at people sexually and it's weird to assume they are. Young kids are just curious about things and like to watch people do stuff.", "NTA. It's really hard being a teenage girl. A lot of missteps, hyper self conscious, etc. It's not a place to hammer down on what you think is logical. There's no need to feel bad about what happened- talk to her and her folks about how your son loves lawn mowing, how if she worked on a firetruck it's about the firetruck.  As an adult you can help her through this. But devil's advocate, don't be the person watching a teenage girl mow her lawn.", "Nta. It's one. I hate kids but I'm not going to yell at it for existing", "NTA that lady has other issues, none of which are yours!", "Why didn't you go sit next to him and tell that idiot to get off you're property.

Can\u2019t talk to em, can\u2019t look at them. I treat women the same way I treat children at this point. I ignore them. I used to hold doors for women but even that is risky now.

Yelling and sexualising a baby isnt ok. Yelling at them in their own yard while they observe and learn from their environment is also wrong.", "NTA. even if she genuinely felt uncomfortable, the appropriate response would have calmly come to you and ask you to take him inside.

She obviously shouldn\u2019t have expressed herself that way - I mean, who gets anything from yelling at a baby?? - but it\u2019s not at all unreasonable for her to want to not be watched that intently. Maybe she\u2019s sensitive to being under the microscope of a stranger's gaze. Maybe she was feeling othered and didn\u2019t want to be treated like a spectacle. Maybe babies in general creep her out. Who knows?!? Those are all valid feelings that she acted on poorly. I take this as her doing a bad job of setting a reasonable boundary. The most important thing is knowing you\u2019re not a bad mom, you keep on enjoying outside time with your son, and it\u2019s not ok for anyone to scream at you or your kid for whatever reason.", "The only issue would be if she told you to stop watching her and you continued.

Everything you son did was behaviorally and developmentally appropriate. Your neighbor has issues, though, so I would keep your son away from her. That type of verbal abuse will be confusing to him and, eventually, hurtful.", "Maybe something to consider is a little compassion for the 15 year old. I teach 15 year olds and often get all sorts of random flip outs like this without any clear trigger. Trauma and mental health challenges are a thing in 15 year olds that do not have the coping and conflict management skills to navigate difficult emotions and situations. TBH this May have absolutely nothing to do with and your kid. It may everything to do with an activated kid trying to self manage without the maturity or knowledge about how to do so. You have no idea what is bothering her and she may just be lashing out at you and your kid because you are there. I often need to take a breath or two with a smile (as difficult as it can be sometimes) and offer help or support while acknowledging their expressions. Don\u2019t back down from clear boundaries to protect you and your kid ( you are doing the best you can so go you) but alittle compassion might go a long way.
