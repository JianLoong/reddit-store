We live in a cul-de-sac so we can see everyone's front yard from ours. \n\nThe neighbors teenage daughter maybe around 15 years old comes out with her lawnmower and gets to work on her yard. (She lives dorectly across the street from us) My son loves watching the world go by, he often wathces the older kids play on the street and they always interact and say hi to him. So he runs to our fence with his little Juice box and sits down in front of the gate so he can watch her mow the lawn. He wasn't always watching her sometimes he'd just start picking the dandelions and throwing them around our yard but most of the time he'd just sit and watch quietly. \n\nI kept my eye on him because it's a low fence and I'd never let him play out front not supervised, I've read horror stories of parents letting there kids play put front and getting snatched. I was also just plotting around the garden and looking into my vege boxes to see what's growing. \n\nShe kept looking over at my son and then going back to work I watched her walk over to my fence and she started screaming how it's creepy my son watching her and I need to teach him from a young age not to stare at women or else he'll grow up and be a creep. I got up right away and grabbed my son and apologized and tried to say he's just curious what your doing but she kept screaming at me because she doesn't like to be watched. I scooped my son up who was crying at this point (what baby wouldn't cry being yelled at) and hurried to the back yard so he could play there. \n\nShe left while angerly muttering to herself about how I'm a bad mother and my son will soon be a creep. \n\nI'm now feeling really bad about letting my son watch her mow the lawn and maybe we shouldn't play I'm the front yard any more. \n \nSo am I asshole for letting my son sit and watch?", "created_utc": 1677370164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c02nv/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_letting_my_toddler/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids these days they grow up so fast", "NTA. \n\nThat little dude has no concept of what\u2019s even going on at all in life. No offense, no one year old does. \n\nBabies literally stare at people and things to learn how to be a human.", "No you're NTA, and your neighbor has some issues to work through. Perhaps when she grows up, she'll realize a 1 1/2 yr old doesn't think along the same lines she's obviously thinking.  He's thinking the neat-o thingamabob that does the rrr-rrr-rrr sound.  If anyone is being creepy, it's her.", "Oh, dear lord. This 15 year old has issues she needs to work out with a professional. \n\nNTA, OP.", "NTA \n\nEven for a 15 year old, that was an overreaction. She\u2019s old enough to tell you that it\u2019s making her uncomfortable and to ask you to come get him. Screaming at you was unnecessary, and obviously your toddler isn\u2019t creepy. Just a teenage overreaction that was probably 85% about something else going on in her life.", "Your son was probably more interested in the lawnmower than the girl... Such an overreaction by her. NTA.", "NTA, seriously, that girl needs professional help if she is feeling sexualized by a \"predatory toddler\"", "NTA. I was prepared to say otherwise, as I know what it's like to be a teenage girl and feel so anxious about being on display or being observed. But this chick yelled at a literal baby. I would not have been able to keep my cool like you did", "NTA. Your kid is 1.5, he learns by watching the world around him. She's definitely over reacting. I'd probably talk to her parents in case there's a backstory to her reaction that they need to look into and so she doesn't scream at another toddler", "NTA- Too much tic tok for that neighbor", "Aww this is so f ing sad! Your innocent baby is just enjoying the outdoors and gets abused by this disturbed teen. I feel bad for everyone here. NTA", "NTA.  Your child is still a baby.  Babies learn by watching and mimicking. This girl has issues.", "NTA. She has some issues if she thinks a baby watching her in public is creepy.", "NTA\n\nYou need to go next door and talk to her mother about SCREAMING AT A LITERAL BABY\n\nLike what in the actual fudgenugget???", "NTA.  \nHe is 1.5! What was that girl even thinking?  \nShe could  also just waved at him, he maybe would have laughed and waved back.", "NTA. But the neighbors kid is. Your child is on your property and can watch whomever he wants, whoever he wants.

NTA.", "NTA the fact that she is putting a toddler in a sexual context, even as the \u201cpredator\u201d is disturbing and I would either watch her or speak to the parents if it continues. A child does not have the mental aptitude to sexuality anything and lawn mowers are awesome. I used to drive my dad nuts because I would tear ours apart and rebuild starting at age 6 so yay machines. I am a woman who was SA as a child and for her to project that onto a child is very red flag to me.", "NTA. Who the hell sees a baby and thinks it's creepy he's watching her?!?", "Toddlers love watching people, animals, machines. It\u2019s your yard.

Teenager has some issues to me", "NTA. Your son is a child who is just learning about the world. He's curious and fascinated by everything. You can't really stop him from paying attention to things and trying to figure out how the world works. No matter where you plop him down, he's going to be looking around and trying to make sense of the world he lives in.\n\nIt's your neighbor who has the problem.

I'd teach my son how to avoid her like the plague!", "NTA He\u2019s a literal baby that\u2019s just looking around curious about what\u2019s going on outside, she wouldn\u2019t know the baby was watching her if she wasn\u2019t so fixated on the baby", "NTA. Your child is literally a baby, not some perverted old creep. A baby.", "NTA. Are you going to let a 15 year old brat dictate what you can and can't do in your own yard? Your child is too young to understand these things and as you said he is just curious. Talking to the girls mom would be a good solution as the girl owes you an apology. In the future if issues come up between you and a minor that cause a conflict, avoid engaging the minor. Just discuss it with their parent.", "NTA! what in the world? I\u2019m sorry she added any unneeded stress to your day. Your son is just enjoying the world! And who on earth would yell at a toddler and a mother for no reason?

My son (1.3) loves people watching and enjoys observing the world too, This is how children learn. If someone had come up to me like this, mama bear would have come out, so I take my hat off for how you handled it.

Toddlers love watching other people going about their day. I\u2019m sorry your neighbor was mean to your kiddo! It sounds like she\u2019s been through some stuff.", "Omg he\u2019s a baby!! NTA!", "NTA and i agree with everyone saying to talk to the girl's parents. She's got issues that need to be addressed.", "NTA. That little girl has issues. Sad. He\u2019s a toddler.", "NTA and I would be having a nice chat with the girls parents about how her screaming at your son is not ok.

Does she honestly think a female 1.5-year-old wouldn't do the exact same thing?\n\nThis fifteen-year-old girl is almost an adult and should be acting more maturely herself. Nothing wrong with not liking being watched, kids *are* creepy sometimes. But you're not \"raising a creep\" by letting them do what kids do.", "NTA.   The 15 year old has issues", "Who here has had a kid crawl under the bathroom stall? \n\nI sure have. \n\nDid I tell the mom their kid was being a creep? \n\nNope. \n\nWhy? \n\nIt\u2019s a kid. Kids do weird things with no explanation. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If your son was 15 then sure but he is 1.\n\nShe is being ridiculous.", "NTA\nHe's a literal baby. Girl got issues", "NTA She sounds like a Redditor.", "NTA.\n\n1. A toddler watching the world go by is not a crime.\n\n2. The only thing creepy and weird about this is that girl's attitude.", "WTAF?\n\nWhy is a baby\u2019s gaze creepy? He\u2019s just a baby!", "Teenage neighbor needs to get offline. This reaction is weird as hell even for a teenager. That is essentially a BABY watching her. \n\nNTA.", "Wow. 100 percent NTA. This girl has some issues she needs to address.", "NTA  the girl sounds like she has mental issues that need to be addressed.  a toddler watching someone do something doesn't make them grow up to be creeps", "NTA. She's just one of those people who's always looking to be offended by something.", "NTA, but I\u2019d extend some empathy to the 15 year old. She\u2019s likely already being sexualized by men much, much older than her. She can\u2019t yell at them, so she is lashing out where she feel safe enough to. \n\nI\u2019d probably respond with something like \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it sounds like you\u2019ve had some bad experiences with people staring at you\u201d and see if she opens up.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t think too much into this.  Your child is simply curious and that\u2019s okay.  The neighbor kid is probably insecure and possibly mentally unstable like most kids that age.  If your child is on your own property he can do whatever he wants. Next time, tell her she can mind her own business cause obviously she\u2019s got issues.", "NTA\n\nYour son is 1 and just curious. This girl has issues", "NTA and i would have a talk with her parents. that reaction was harsh for seemingly no reason, and if it were me, id be concerned something was going on at home or happened to her that made her feel triggered. her reaction wasnt valid, obviously. no need to traumatize your baby, but i think most healthy people wouldnt make a comment like that.", "Of course NTA. That poor girl has issues.", "NTA.   What a brat.  You're  nicer than I would have been", "NTA", "NTA. i can see why she may have been uncomfortable with being stared at while going about her business but the way she handled it was over the top.", "NTA. Toddlers aren't looking at people sexually and it's weird to assume they are. Young kids are just curious about things and like to watch people do stuff.", "NTA. It's really hard being a teenage girl. A lot of missteps, hyper self conscious, etc. It's not a place to hammer down on what you think is logical. There's no need to feel bad about what happened- talk to her and her folks about how your son loves lawn mowing, how if she worked on a firetruck it's about the firetruck.  As an adult you can help her through this. But devil's advocate, don't be the person watching a teenage girl mow her lawn.", "Nta. It's one. I hate kids but I'm not going to yell at it for existing", "NTA that lady has other issues, none of which are yours!", "Why didn't you go sit next to him and tell that idiot to get off you're property. I would have stared at her with my kid until she freaked out and ran inside.", "Oh LORD this is out of control. NTA.\n\nI\u2019m to the point where I am avoiding eye contact with women. Can\u2019t talk to em, can\u2019t look at them. I treat women the same way I treat children at this point. I ignore them. I used to hold doors for women but even that is risky now. So sad.\n\nShe probably saw the whole tik tok trend where women recording themselves at the gym actively shame men for even glancing in their direction.", "Esh.\nSome people don't like being watched. \n\nAlso she didn't have to scream", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yelling and sexualising a baby isnt ok. Yelling at them in their own yard while they observe and learn from their environment is also wrong.", "NTA. even if she genuinely felt uncomfortable, the appropriate response would have calmly come to you and ask you to take him inside. What toddler is aware of social norms like that? \n\nAnd c'mon, he is too young for just watching to be considered creepy.", "NTA. I'd be talking to her parents how she felt entitled to scream at a 1.5yo and call him a creep.", "NTA\u2026 he\u2019s a baby, what\u2019s he gonna do?", "You're NTA but your neighbor is.", "He's a child. Not much more than a baby and she is deranged if she thinks he has a creepy interest in her. What a piece of work.

He also watches people, it's how they learn to human. \n\nShe massively overreacted. I'd be willing to bet she has some personal shit going on and is stressing about it. This event will likely be one that haunts her as shes falling asleep for the next 20 years.", "NTA and I do have empathy for the girl as well. She obviously shouldn\u2019t have expressed herself that way - I mean, who gets anything from yelling at a baby?? - but it\u2019s not at all unreasonable for her to want to not be watched that intently. Maybe she\u2019s sensitive to being under the microscope of a stranger's gaze. Maybe she was feeling othered and didn\u2019t want to be treated like a spectacle. Maybe babies in general creep her out. Who knows?!? Those are all valid feelings that she acted on poorly. I take this as her doing a bad job of setting a reasonable boundary. The most important thing is knowing you\u2019re not a bad mom, you keep on enjoying outside time with your son, and it\u2019s not ok for anyone to scream at you or your kid for whatever reason.", "The only issue would be if she told you to stop watching her and you continued. Your kids was doing a totally normal thing", "NTA. But I feel for the neighbor. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s already been cat called, harassed, or possibly worse at her age. Obviously your toddler didn\u2019t mean anything by his staring and is just observing the world around him. She\u2019s not an expert in child development.", "NTA\n\nThat is one messed up young woman.  I feel bad for her classmates.   Talk to her parents, let them know what happened.   It may help them help her.", "NTA In my (admittedly limited) experience teens these days seem weirdly prudish compared to older generations. (I'm sure it has something to do with having  your sexual awakening after the Weinstein allegations and the ensuing me too movement, but I'm not sure how one would go about checking this out.) But that was waaay over the top. She must have her own issues or something, because to lose it on a toddler like that is just wild.", "NTA- what the hell? Just today I took my 18 month old out for a walk and my neighbor had three guys doing landscaping. She plunked down and watched them and a couple of them waved to her and held up their tools in the off mode and she loved it. They finished and she was so excited.", "NTA. Everything you son did was behaviorally and developmentally appropriate. Your neighbor has issues, though, so I would keep your son away from her. That type of verbal abuse will be confusing to him and, eventually, hurtful.", "Maybe something to consider is a little compassion for the 15 year old. I teach 15 year olds and often get all sorts of random flip outs like this without any clear trigger. Trauma and mental health challenges are a thing in 15 year olds that do not have the coping and conflict management skills to navigate difficult emotions and situations. TBH this May have absolutely nothing to do with and your kid. It may everything to do with an activated kid trying to self manage without the maturity or knowledge about how to do so. You have no idea what is bothering her and she may just be lashing out at you and your kid because you are there. I often need to take a breath or two with a smile (as difficult as it can be sometimes) and offer help or support while acknowledging their expressions. Don\u2019t back down from clear boundaries to protect you and your kid ( you are doing the best you can so go you) but alittle compassion might go a long way. I think everyone could use a little more compassion in our society these days.
