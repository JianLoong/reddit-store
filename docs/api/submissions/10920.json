It's really hard being a teenage girl. A lot of missteps, hyper self conscious, etc. It's not a place to hammer down on what you think is logical. There's no need to feel bad about what happened- talk to her and her folks about how your son loves lawn mowing, how if she worked on a firetruck it's about the firetruck.

She obviously shouldn\u2019t have expressed herself that way - I mean, who gets anything from yelling at a baby?? - but it\u2019s not at all unreasonable for her to want to not be watched that intently. Maybe she\u2019s sensitive to being under the microscope of a stranger's gaze. Maybe she was feeling othered and didn\u2019t want to be treated like a spectacle. Maybe babies in general creep her out. Who knows?!? Those are all valid feelings that she acted on poorly. I take this as her doing a bad job of setting a reasonable boundary.

I teach 15 year olds and often get all sorts of random flip outs like this without any clear trigger. Trauma and mental health challenges are a thing in 15 year olds that do not have the coping and conflict management skills to navigate difficult emotions and situations. TBH this May have absolutely nothing to do with and your kid. It may everything to do with an activated kid trying to self manage without the maturity or knowledge about how to do so. You have no idea what is bothering her and she may just be lashing out at you and your kid because you are there. I often need to take a breath or two with a smile (as difficult as it can be sometimes) and offer help or support while acknowledging their expressions. Don\u2019t back down from clear boundaries to protect you and your kid ( you are doing the best you can so go you) but alittle compassion might go a long way.
