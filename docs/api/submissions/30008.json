Frequently, I will refer to a conversation that I\u2019d had with him previously, and he will say that I made it up and the conversation never happened. I misremember events a lot. For example, I thought I told him our children had dentist appointments on a certain date, but he said I didn\u2019t. I could have sworn we had the conversation. I even remembered writing the appointment on the calendar on our fridge while we were talking. The writing on the calendar is there but he said we never spoke. Things like this happen all the time.\n\nLast week I texted him to ask if he could pick up our child after school and he responded yes. He did not show up for our child and when I asked what happened, he said he didn\u2019t know he was supposed to pick them up and that this was yet another conversation I had in my mind or with someone else. I showed him the text and he got upset and kept saying I was confused and the conversation didn\u2019t happen, even though I had the text and his response in black and white. I was excited that for once I hadn\u2019t messed up and that my memory was correct. I suggested I begin writing down notes or doing text confirmations about future conversations, since I feel he could be misremembering things too now that I have proof that it is possible. He got upset and said he felt like I was trying to catch him making a mistake so I could rub it in and that I think I tell him things but I\u2019m either talking to myself or having a conversation with a friend and thinking it was with him. I decided I was going to do it anyway because the relief I felt when I had text confirmation was such a big deal. This could be an asshole move. \n\nThis morning I reminded him of an appointment I had after work tomorrow and that he would need to pick up our child at school. He denied us ever speaking about it. I told him that I was 100% sure we talked about it at dinner on Friday night. He apparently could tell I was confident and asked if I had recorded it or written it down, and I said I had taken notes but only to keep my own thoughts straight. He is not happy with me because he had said he was not okay with me trying to trick or catch him when we talked about it before. We got into an argument and I ended up crying and threw away my notepaper I had written on. Part of me wants to continue for my own peace of mind but I also want to be respectful and not do something if it makes him mad. It just felt so nice to not feel crazy. \n\nAITA for taking notes even when he got upset with me when I talked about it the first time?\n\nUpdate: I will be having a discussion with him about going to see a doctor, just for a general checkup. Mine is coming up in December so I\u2019ll just put it in terms like \u201cI know you don\u2019t like doctors but we could do it together!\u201d I\u2019ll bring up cognitive issues with my own doctor again as well. Also I now understand why people do the \u201cthrowaway account\u201d thing because two real life friends saw this and have reached out to me via text, and both said they\u2019ve had concerns for a while.

Would randomly not pick her up from school, would go out for groceries and come back with McDonalds for himself. He would argue and gaslight and just clearly stopped caring about his family, so his wife divorced him. A year later he was diagnosed with some kind of neurological, very early-onset alzheimers-thing and died before we all graduated college.  \n\nSo, I guess my point is, your husband needs medical evaluation to make sure he's an asshole, not someone suffering from a degenerative illness.", "You know how on the internet people misuse the term \"gaslighting\"? Well, this is the real deal. Your husband sounds irresponsible, immature, and frankly abusive. He is neglecting his responsibilities as a father and husband and then he is trying to convince you that you are the crazy one by twisting reality. I wouldn't take notes, I would voice record every conversation until he starts acting responsible and apologizes for his behavior because I guarantee you if you do take notes he will try and tell you that you misunderstood and wrote it down wrong, or he will accuse you of doctoring the notes. NTA but this relationship sounds unhealthy. Your poor kids.", "NTA\n\nYou know how this sub throws around accusations of \"gaslighting\" with little concern for what the term truly refers to?\n\n> I showed him the text and he got upset and kept saying I was confused and the conversation didn\u2019t happen, even though I had the text and his response in black and white.\n\n#This \\*actually is\\* gaslighting.", "NTA.\n\nA lot of people throw around the word \"gaslight\" improperly, but here? It would be proper to use it. Your husband is gaslighting you- he is upset at you for taking notes because it means he can't make you doubt yourself.\n\nThe fact that you felt relief like that when you had evidence? Tells me that this is NOT a good situation for you to be in. He is trying to make you feel crazy ON PURPOSE. \n\nMy advice, if a friend came to me and told me this was happening? RUN. Run as far as you can. This guy is manipulative and awful.", "INFO is this new behaviour? I\u2019d be concerned there\u2019s a medical reason behind his memory issues.", "NTA, this is next level gaslighting. Maybe do texts as a follow up to conversations as a matter of course, something like \"just following up to our conversation about parent teacher night Monday at 5\" or \"a quick reminder I'm going to stay with a friend to think about if I want to continue with someone who treats me with so little respect\"", "NTA - normally this would be kind of odd to do with a partner but the gaslighting is real with this one. Something is def off here.", "Ha, you are awesome, note taking person! If you ever wanted to be a project manager, you have a natural flair for it!\n\nI would say the best plan was to always send a text with the important point/points on it. That means it is a reminder to him and effectively a note for you. I honestly love it when my significant other does this for me - my memory isn't perfect, and it can help straighten out events when we look back at stuff, often things we never thought we would need to refer back to weeks or months later.\n\nBut, your husband, bless him, is so happy with his plausible deniability, he does not want that. And when you take notes anyway, which has nothing to do with him unless he is in the wrong - he has a full blown tantrum.\n\nKeep taking notes. Be aware that every time you feel crazy, your husband is happier with you feeling this way than admitting his own mistake.

If he starts getting aggressive about this, don't wait for him to get violent.  Get out.", "His tell is that he is angry when you point it out. A person with genuine memory problems would be embarrassed maybe, but not mad. they most certainly would not take it out on you by throwing away your notes. This is textbook gaslighting and it makes me wonder what else he\u2019s doing that he\u2019s trained you to think is normal but isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a fantastic book by Lundy Bankroft called Why Does He Do That, it helped me a lot while I was recovering from a relationship with a narcissist.

They need to help him.", "NTA sounds like you are being gaslit into thinking you are a bad communicator but the problem isn't really you.\n\nI'm thinking I could have saved a lot of arguments with my husband if I'd been writing stuff down when we talk. He often had both ends if the conversation in his head and shared only the concluding thought with me.... if that. Then I'd tell him we didn't talk and he wouldn't remember. Or, he'd forget I told him something and claim I never said it.... But we both knew I had. It took him a long time to accept that I was right about these things.\n\nNow, the tables have turned and I'm the one that forgets stuff. SMH", "From the title I thought it might be writing down your interpretation of less specific stuff, where you might have written down what you wanted to hear. But this is specifics and requires action - at least the examples you provided are. Can you ask him each time to enter it in his phone's calendar, with reminders? Forgetting stuff that is out of one's routines is easy to do, though a person should develop ways to remember - like when parents are told to put a teddy bear in the front seat when they have a child in the car seat in back. Of course, as noted on another comment, it could be a progressive medical issue, but it is more likely that he is just human but being prickly about admitting it. Is he perhaps touchy about forgetfulness based on approaching 50?", "NTA - But OP, you should be concerned about your husbands mental health. Is this a new thing?", "Ma'am, you are being gaslit. NTA at all.", "NTA!

He kind of puts you in a position where taking notes is a good idea. \n\nIf he insists on being a dumbass and not fully listening or retaining conversations, I recommend the classic \"family kitchen calendar\".

Your husband is likely the one with memory issues but it\u2019s easier to blame you than admit that, plus he gets out of doing things so it\u2019s occasionally beneficial to him as well. That or he is legitimately gaslighting you on purpose to make you feel crazy. Hopefully it\u2019s the first one. Keep writing down your notes, like you said it\u2019s for your own benefit because he\u2019s made it clear that he thinks you have memory problems and you\u2019re working to improve. He just doesn\u2019t like it that he\u2019s been caught twice trying to blame you for his forgetfulness. If it happened twice already chances are it\u2019s happening a lot more than that.

Forget note-taking\u2014voice record a few conversations and play it back to him and then tell him to cut it out. If he doesn\u2019t suggest counseling because he seriously needs help", "NTA at all. this is genuinely textbook gaslighting", "Start recording the conversations,  he would have a really hard time denying it if he heard or saw himself in a video saying it. The fact that you had text proof and he denied it shows me he's doing this intentionally and is hoping he can make you feel crazy instead of acknowledging that he just doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions.", "This is pretty common. Just yesterday someone did the same thing but they were recording the conversation instead of taking notes.\n\nThe thing is, neither one of you is *completely* wrong. I can almost guarantee that both of you have thought they said something that you didn't. But the opposite is also true - you've said stuff that the other person HAS forgotten (just like your example).\n\nMy wife's friend was telling her about how she was certain she had discussed something with her husband but it turned out she had discussed it with my wife, not her husband.\n\nMistakes happen.\n\nSeems like you probably need a discussion about mutual goals. The point of writing things down shouldn't be to show someone they are wrong but to keep you both on the same page because you BOTH want your kid to be picked up from school (for example).\n\nNeither of you are 20 years old anymore (I'm in the same boat) and memory issues are only going to get worse. It's not necessarily a medical issue - everyone I know in their 40s is having the same kind of issue more and more. So figure out a system that works for both of you and view it as a positive thing - a way to help and coordinate and make the two of you work better together.\n\nEdit: NTA since your husband refused to acknowledge the written example.", "NTA, and the way I see it, there are 2 possibilities.  \nHe's gaslighting you, and I'm not a fan of using that term as it gets overused, but denying a text conversation while looking at it, fits that well.  \nBut, so does option 2.  \nSome form of dementia or cognitive decline.  \nI'm leaning more to option 1, mostly because you said this has been going on for most of your 15 year relationship. And that's a very long time for cognitive decline to plateau.", "You DO realize this is the very definition of gaslighting, right? Go right out and watch the film Gas Light.

Got it.", "He\u2019s \u201cforgotten\u201d to pick up his own child multiple times and gets angry if you prove that he was actually told about it and that he confirmed that he would. \n\nHe either has a super fucked up personality disorder, a brain injury, or some other medical issue, or he\u2019s just a useless worthless idiot.", "Sounds like my future ex-wife", "sweetie their are only two possible options here and that's it.\n\n1. he is gaslighting the crap out of you for fun.\n2. their is seriously something wrong with him\n\ntheir are no other options. it has to be one of those because nothing in this world would make sense why he is trying to twist everything around and say your lying when you had text proof of a conversation. \n\ntheir is only two solutions. \n\n1. he goes to couples therapy and figures out why hes gaslighting you so hard.\n2. he goes to a dr and finds out why his memory is having issues.\n\nwell i guess three.\n\n3. you get divorce. \n\nbut 3. is really only is you cant keep doing this anymore. but it really sounds like hes gaslighting you hard and i wouldnt want to put up with it for the rest of my life. i would be out of there.", "the motive for gaslighting is to make the victim feel like they can\u2019t trust themself or their own perceptions or memory. it is a power grab, it is sadistic, it does not need a reason you or i understand. run op. run far away.", "I disagree.  I think he\u2019s full on gaslighting her to avoid dealing with the fall out of missing his responsibilities", "He's lying. He is LYING to you. He is GASLIGHTING YOU. He is *LYING*. \n\nAnd it sounds like he has been doing this for a long time. How many times, since you met him, have you been SO SURE about something, but he says you're wrong? He says you made it up? Even when you have proof to the contrary? \n\nHun. He is doing this ON PURPOSE. He is making you doubt yourself ON PURPOSE. He is shirking his duties as a father... And I have to ask. Has he ever used this to get out of plans? Do you have a close relationship with your family, friends, anyone aside from him? Has anyone else ever expressed concerns about his behavior?", "Why do you believe him? Have you ever been able to substantiate that you have memory issues of this caliber?\n\nEither one of you has had a TBI or something, or one of you is doing this on purpose.", "THAT IS CALLED GASLIGHTING", "Happy Cake Day! (And me too!)", "It\u2019s the throwing away part that got me", "I can send you my digital version you can read on your phone! Dm me if you\u2019d like", "He doesn\u2019t like texting because it provides a way to prove that he is gaslighting you.  With a phone call, there is no record of what was said.", "It sounds like it\u2019s gotten more pronounced over time because he\u2019s gotten more and more confident in his ability to gaslight you with every successful attempt", "White board!", "Babe... That's BECAUSE of the manipulation.\n\nLook at your example of the text. You have the text. Right there. Time stamped. Yet he still tried to say you never told him?\n\nEither he's gaslighting or he is the one with cognitive issues and won't admit that he's having a problem.", "My husband is old fashioned and does not like using his cell phone for anything but calls and he doesn\u2019t like apps either. I am going to gently insist that we try the calendar app, and also upgrade the paper one on the fridge to something larger and more eye catching. \n\nI will be listening to the audiobook tomorrow on my commute to the office.", "It has gotten him out of plans, yes.\n\nI don\u2019t have many friends and I don\u2019t talk about this kind of thing normally because I\u2019m embarrassed. There was an incident with a pizza a couple of weeks ago that I told my best girlfriend about and she said that she was uncomfortable with the situation and offered to let me stay at her house if I needed to get away. It seemed a little extreme because it was an argument about a pizza and maybe I over explained because I\u2019m not good at being concise.", "When we argued last week I said \u201cmaybe I just need to see a neurologist or a psychiatrist if you think I\u2019m always talking to myself!\u201d in a kind of sarcastic and mean tone. He said I was being super extra and taking things to the extreme just like I always do and that I just needed to pay more attention. Other people are bringing up the possibility of medical issues, maybe both of us should be checked out.", "OP- he is absolutely gaslighting and has been for years. Screw the writing down notes- open your phone and use the memos app- to RECORD the conversation. But really, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time to walk away bc he is lying to you and making YOU feel like you\u2019re crazy! It is malicious and it\u2019s absolutely not fair.", "Just record any important conversations on your own phone. Label them and play them back to him. If he gets mad that you recorded the conversation instead of admitting that he is forgetful you will have all the proof you need that he gaslighting you. Which he totally is, by the way.", "We use COZI as a shared family calendar. NTA", "You are in an emotionally abusive relationship and your friend, as well as all of Reddit, sees right through your husband\u2019s gaslighting. That\u2019s why she offered you to stay. You deserve better than this. There is nothing wrong with your memory.", "Seconding the other comment below on this. \n\nYou are NOT in a normal relationship. This is NOT okay. Every single thing you have posted is setting my alarm bells off- you are CONSTANTLY putting yourself down, making excuses. Even when you had EVIDENCE that your husband gaslit you, you are still saying \"well maybe my memory is bad\"...\n\nOP. I have ADHD. I actually have *issues* with my memory. And my partner has NEVER done this to me. When we come up on something where there was miscommunication? We TALK IT OUT. My wife does not just tell me I made it up. EVER. And I would never DREAM of doing that to her- let alone when it was written on the damn calendar. \n\nYou friend sees that this isn't okay. The comments here see that this isn't okay. Your husband is mistreating you and it is painfully plain to see. I hope that you see it, too- and frankly, I hope you remove yourself from the situation as soon as possible. People who are willing to lie to your like your husband does are NOT good people to be around.", "NTA. You need to have a deeper conversation with your friend about this and really listen. \n\nAlso google Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft. You can download a free copy. See if it sounds familiar.", "if your friend is offering you somewhere to stay, you\u2019re being abused", "Your friend was trying to help you, because she sees that you are being abused. You've been trained to doubt yourself and assume that whatever the problem is, you're the cause. \n\nPlease, please listen to the good advice here. Your husband's behavior is not normal, it's cruel.", "Are you happy being treated this way?", "If it's gotten worse I'd definitely insist on a check up. He's either gaslighting you or there's something going on, both are concerning for different reasons.", "Another lovely, lovely commenter sent a copy of it my way and I\u2019m going to start on it tomorrow. I very much appreciate your recommendation.", "This might sound stupid but I guess I never thought about me being treated a certain way. I am unhappy, but it\u2019s because I keep screwing stuff up and making home life hard. I want to be better. Other people don\u2019t seem to have issues like this.", "Be safe and good luck! Don\u2019t let your husband know anything has changed.", "I wonder if this happens to him at work or in other settings. He could be dissociating and losing time, and denying it\u2014blaming it on you. If he\u2019s doing it purposely, then it\u2019s abusive, but if not, he needs to see a psychiatrist or neurologist for an assessment. It\u2019s very scary that he has convinced you that it\u2019s your problem.", "Other people don\u2019t have a husband like yours. \n\nIf he truly believed your memories issues were as bad as all that, he\u2019d WANT you to see a doctor. He\u2019d be worried.", "But you\u2019re not! You\u2019re trying you\u2019re writing stuff down your acknowledging mistakes. What is he doing? Why is everything your fault? Ask yourself that. You are working on it. He\u2019s just gaslighting you (and I hate the overuse of that word) NTA", "But it is not you who keeps screwing up. You have written proof of that now. He screws up and then tells you it is your fault. Do not believe him. Other people don't have issues like this because they don't have a lying partner. Keep taking the notes or text him a confirmation when you tell him something.\n\nEither he is forgetful and won't take responsibility or he is doing this deliberately to get out of stuff.  Either way, do not take the blame yourself.", "Oh Hun....this is so sad to read. He's got you actually believing this is a you problem.", "Wait a minute- you aren\u2019t the one screwing stuff up and making home life hard. He is.You don\u2019t \u201cneed to be better.\u201d He does. Other people don\u2019t have these issues because they aren\u2019t married to your husband. \n\nPlease listen to your friends and listen to everyone here- your husband is abusive and has gaslit you so badly that he has convinced you that you are the problem. YOU ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. He is, and I hope you start planning a safe exit.", "oh honey, you\u2019re being abused. i just left a marriage where i was made to feel the same way. it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your husband.", "This is one of the reasons why I am convinced it\u2019s a me issue. He is extremely successful at his job. He says he uses his physical and mental energy at work, it\u2019s possible he has nothing left in the tank by the time he is home.", "^^^^^This^^^^^^^", "Your friends reached out and said they had concerns about what? \n\nDO NOT TALK TO HIM ABOUT GOING TO THE DOCTOR. ACT LIKE NOTHING HAS CHANGED.", "Honey,  \n\nJust ... No. It is NOT a you issue . Also the chance this is a medical is extremely small. Like minuscule. If it was, when he saw the text if the school pick up he would have made some other excuse, \"oh, got busy at work & forgot,\" but to look you in the eyeballs & say \"that didn't happen\" holy shit the audacity to dismiss black & white physical proof- I just ... He *knows* what he is doing & he *knows* he can get away with it because he was doing it for so long. And your getting upset & throwing away your notes? That's a win for him. He made you upset so you won't do it again SO HE CAN KEEP ABUSING YOU. \n\nThis absolutely abuse. He is planting doubt in your mind so you are dependant on him. \n\nI tell you this as someone who was told \"that never happened\" A LOT. And I believed it because I have a bunch of medical conditions that cause brain fog. But I started to feel like I was *so sure* that actually happened. And it was confusing. So I started recording our conversations. The next \"you never told me that\" I pressed play and all hell broke loose because there was no way he could lie his way out of that one. As soon as I am financially able to I am filing for divorce. \n\nPlease, please, please listen to your friends. \n\nAsk yourself: if my child(ren) told hme this was happening to them, would I want them to blame themselves and stay?  I certainly hope that answer isn't yes.", "OP, please take it from someone who's been abused similarly, YOU ARE BEING ABUSED. He is CHOOSING to do this to you.", "your husband is a narcissist", "One friend said they are afraid that my husband\u2019s behavior will some day escalate beyond just raising his voice or saying things that hurt my feelings. That surprised me. \n\nI have heard the word \u2018gaslighting\u2019 a lot in different contexts but I always thought that gaslighting was a form of abuse. I did not feel abused, just sad. I\u2019m beginning to see that abuse is very multifaceted."]}
