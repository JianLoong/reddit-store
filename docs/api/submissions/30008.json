Frequently, I will refer to a conversation that I\u2019d had with him previously, and he will say that I made it up and the conversation never happened. I misremember events a lot. For example, I thought I told him our children had dentist appointments on a certain date, but he said I didn\u2019t. I could have sworn we had the conversation. I even remembered writing the appointment on the calendar on our fridge while we were talking. The writing on the calendar is there but he said we never spoke. Things like this happen all the time.\n\nLast week I texted him to ask if he could pick up our child after school and he responded yes. He did not show up for our child and when I asked what happened, he said he didn\u2019t know he was supposed to pick them up and that this was yet another conversation I had in my mind or with someone else. I showed him the text and he got upset and kept saying I was confused and the conversation didn\u2019t happen, even though I had the text and his response in black and white. I was excited that for once I hadn\u2019t messed up and that my memory was correct. I suggested I begin writing down notes or doing text confirmations about future conversations, since I feel he could be misremembering things too now that I have proof that it is possible. He got upset and said he felt like I was trying to catch him making a mistake so I could rub it in and that I think I tell him things but I\u2019m either talking to myself or having a conversation with a friend and thinking it was with him. I decided I was going to do it anyway because the relief I felt when I had text confirmation was such a big deal. This could be an asshole move. \n\nThis morning I reminded him of an appointment I had after work tomorrow and that he would need to pick up our child at school. He denied us ever speaking about it. I told him that I was 100% sure we talked about it at dinner on Friday night. He apparently could tell I was confident and asked if I had recorded it or written it down, and I said I had taken notes but only to keep my own thoughts straight. He is not happy with me because he had said he was not okay with me trying to trick or catch him when we talked about it before. We got into an argument and I ended up crying and threw away my notepaper I had written on. Part of me wants to continue for my own peace of mind but I also want to be respectful and not do something if it makes him mad. It just felt so nice to not feel crazy. \n\nAITA for taking notes even when he got upset with me when I talked about it the first time?\n\nUpdate: I will be having a discussion with him about going to see a doctor, just for a general checkup. Mine is coming up in December so I\u2019ll just put it in terms like \u201cI know you don\u2019t like doctors but we could do it together!\u201d I\u2019ll bring up cognitive issues with my own doctor again as well.

Would randomly not pick her up from school, would go out for groceries and come back with McDonalds for himself. He would argue and gaslight and just clearly stopped caring about his family, so his wife divorced him. A year later he was diagnosed with some kind of neurological, very early-onset alzheimers-thing and died before we all graduated college.  \n\nSo, I guess my point is, your husband needs medical evaluation to make sure he's an asshole, not someone suffering from a degenerative illness.", "You know how on the internet people misuse the term \"gaslighting\"? Well, this is the real deal. Your husband sounds irresponsible, immature, and frankly abusive. He is neglecting his responsibilities as a father and husband and then he is trying to convince you that you are the crazy one by twisting reality. I wouldn't take notes, I would voice record every conversation until he starts acting responsible and apologizes for his behavior because I guarantee you if you do take notes he will try and tell you that you misunderstood and wrote it down wrong, or he will accuse you of doctoring the notes. NTA but this relationship sounds unhealthy. Your poor kids.", "NTA\n\nYou know how this sub throws around accusations of \"gaslighting\" with little concern for what the term truly refers to?\n\n> I showed him the text and he got upset and kept saying I was confused and the conversation didn\u2019t happen, even though I had the text and his response in black and white.\n\n#This \\*actually is\\* gaslighting.", "NTA.\n\nA lot of people throw around the word \"gaslight\" improperly, but here? It would be proper to use it. Your husband is gaslighting you- he is upset at you for taking notes because it means he can't make you doubt yourself.\n\nThe fact that you felt relief like that when you had evidence? Tells me that this is NOT a good situation for you to be in. He is trying to make you feel crazy ON PURPOSE. \n\nMy advice, if a friend came to me and told me this was happening? RUN. Run as far as you can. This guy is manipulative and awful.", "INFO is this new behaviour? I\u2019d be concerned there\u2019s a medical reason behind his memory issues.", "NTA, this is next level gaslighting. Maybe do texts as a follow up to conversations as a matter of course, something like \"just following up to our conversation about parent teacher night Monday at 5\" or \"a quick reminder I'm going to stay with a friend to think about if I want to continue with someone who treats me with so little respect\"", "NTA - normally this would be kind of odd to do with a partner but the gaslighting is real with this one. Something is def off here.", "Ha, you are awesome, note taking person! If you ever wanted to be a project manager, you have a natural flair for it!\n\nI would say the best plan was to always send a text with the important point/points on it. That means it is a reminder to him and effectively a note for you. I honestly love it when my significant other does this for me - my memory isn't perfect, and it can help straighten out events when we look back at stuff, often things we never thought we would need to refer back to weeks or months later.\n\nBut, your husband, bless him, is so happy with his plausible deniability, he does not want that. And when you take notes anyway, which has nothing to do with him unless he is in the wrong - he has a full blown tantrum.\n\nKeep taking notes. Be aware that every time you feel crazy, your husband is happier with you feeling this way than admitting his own mistake.

If he starts getting aggressive about this, don't wait for him to get violent.  Get out.", "His tell is that he is angry when you point it out. A person with genuine memory problems would be embarrassed maybe, but not mad. they most certainly would not take it out on you by throwing away your notes. This is textbook gaslighting and it makes me wonder what else he\u2019s doing that he\u2019s trained you to think is normal but isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a fantastic book by Lundy Bankroft called Why Does He Do That, it helped me a lot while I was recovering from a relationship with a narcissist.

They need to help him.", "NTA sounds like you are being gaslit into thinking you are a bad communicator but the problem isn't really you.\n\nI'm thinking I could have saved a lot of arguments with my husband if I'd been writing stuff down when we talk. He often had both ends if the conversation in his head and shared only the concluding thought with me.... if that. Then I'd tell him we didn't talk and he wouldn't remember. Or, he'd forget I told him something and claim I never said it.... But we both knew I had. It took him a long time to accept that I was right about these things.\n\nNow, the tables have turned and I'm the one that forgets stuff. SMH", "From the title I thought it might be writing down your interpretation of less specific stuff, where you might have written down what you wanted to hear. But this is specifics and requires action - at least the examples you provided are. Can you ask him each time to enter it in his phone's calendar, with reminders? Forgetting stuff that is out of one's routines is easy to do, though a person should develop ways to remember - like when parents are told to put a teddy bear in the front seat when they have a child in the car seat in back. Of course, as noted on another comment, it could be a progressive medical issue, but it is more likely that he is just human but being prickly about admitting it. Is he perhaps touchy about forgetfulness based on approaching 50?", "NTA - But OP, you should be concerned about your husbands mental health. Is this a new thing?", "Ma'am, you are being gaslit. NTA at all.", "NTA!

He kind of puts you in a position where taking notes is a good idea. \n\nIf he insists on being a dumbass and not fully listening or retaining conversations, I recommend the classic \"family kitchen calendar\".

Your husband is likely the one with memory issues but it\u2019s easier to blame you than admit that, plus he gets out of doing things so it\u2019s occasionally beneficial to him as well. That or he is legitimately gaslighting you on purpose to make you feel crazy. Hopefully it\u2019s the first one. Keep writing down your notes, like you said it\u2019s for your own benefit because he\u2019s made it clear that he thinks you have memory problems and you\u2019re working to improve. He just doesn\u2019t like it that he\u2019s been caught twice trying to blame you for his forgetfulness. If it happened twice already chances are it\u2019s happening a lot more than that.

Forget note-taking\u2014voice record a few conversations and play it back to him and then tell him to cut it out. If he doesn\u2019t suggest counseling because he seriously needs help", "NTA at all. this is genuinely textbook gaslighting", "Start recording the conversations,  he would have a really hard time denying it if he heard or saw himself in a video saying it. The fact that you had text proof and he denied it shows me he's doing this intentionally and is hoping he can make you feel crazy instead of acknowledging that he just doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions.", "This is pretty common. Just yesterday someone did the same thing but they were recording the conversation instead of taking notes.\n\nThe thing is, neither one of you is *completely* wrong. I can almost guarantee that both of you have thought they said something that you didn't. But the opposite is also true - you've said stuff that the other person HAS forgotten (just like your example).\n\nMy wife's friend was telling her about how she was certain she had discussed something with her husband but it turned out she had discussed it with my wife, not her husband.\n\nMistakes happen.\n\nSeems like you probably need a discussion about mutual goals. The point of writing things down shouldn't be to show someone they are wrong but to keep you both on the same page because you BOTH want your kid to be picked up from school (for example).\n\nNeither of you are 20 years old anymore (I'm in the same boat) and memory issues are only going to get worse. It's not necessarily a medical issue - everyone I know in their 40s is having the same kind of issue more and more. So figure out a system that works for both of you and view it as a positive thing - a way to help and coordinate and make the two of you work better together.\n\nEdit: NTA since your husband refused to acknowledge the written example.", "NTA, and the way I see it, there are 2 possibilities.  \nHe's gaslighting you, and I'm not a fan of using that term as it gets overused, but denying a text conversation while looking at it, fits that well.  \nBut, so does option 2.  \nSome form of dementia or cognitive decline.  \nI'm leaning more to option 1, mostly because you said this has been going on for most of your 15 year relationship. And that's a very long time for cognitive decline to plateau.", "You DO realize this is the very definition of gaslighting, right? Go right out and watch the film Gas Light.

My mom was such an incredibly toxic influence on my life but in some ways, watching my dad let her abuse me did a lot more damage. You guys deserve better.", "> Can you be an abuser intentionally?\n\nWhy Does He Do That will answer that in depth. But generally, an abuser isn't a James Bond villian with a complicated plan to take over the world. They are self-centred and entitled, and they see their partner (and sometimes other people, e.g. children, staff) as existing to meet their needs. When that person doesn't meet their needs (e.g. the partner is trying to get them to pick up a kid when they don't want to) they find ways to punish the partner and escape doing the thing their partner wants them to do. It is probably a mixture of conscious and unconscious. For instance, it sounds like your husband has a deep aversion to any kind of \"tracking\" of him that makes him accountable, e.g. texts make his skin crawl. \n\nBut it also doesn't have to be intentional to be harmful. If you drop a carton of eggs by accident, they get just as broken as if you deliberately let go of the carton. And hell, if a man was pissed off that he was expected to make breakfast, he'd probably get real careless with those eggs, right? There's not always a bright line between conscious and unconscious.\n\nYou are the eggs, if that wasn't clear. You are getting constantly dropped on the floor by him, whether he means to do it or not, and it is doing a lot of damage to your self esteem and mental health. It doesn't matter if he's a James Bond villian with a plan to throw eggs on the floor until you stop expecting him to do things, or if he forgets everything you say the second you say it and any kind of accountability makes his skin crawl. What matters is that he's breaking you and he doesn't give a flying fuck about it.", "But\u2026 he isn\u2019t trying. At all. You sound like such a lovely, thoughtful, kind lady. You deserve so much better than to be made to feel crazy and upset by a man who can\u2019t even pick up the children he brought into this world.

I do very well at work also, I just think that there, my \u2018quirks\u2019 are actually useful.", "No, his memory is fine. He is very successful at his job, he couldn\u2019t really have gotten very far if he didn\u2019t have his ducks in a row. The only thing he \u2018benefits\u2019 from is not doing the things we talked about. Usually it\u2019s picking up kids, making phone calls to certain places, appointments, sometimes social events. Picking up kids is the #1 thing but it also happens the most.", "Yes this so much", "I did think of that as a possibility because he\u2019s so big into the gym and lifting and fitness and whatnot. He said no, and I believe him. He will not even take an aspirin or use Neosporin on cuts.", "Your husband won't go along with your suggested solutions because he is doing this on purpose.", "He\u2019s using gaslighting with a touch of weaponized incompetence. \n\nIf he can\u2019t be relied upon to do basic things, then you won\u2019t ask him to do anything.", "Someone suggested voice notes- I would actually just text him a recap after each time you have an important conversation that way you both have record of it. Simple and prevents ANY possibility of him saying you doctored the recording/ notes", "Do you use Alexa at home?  Have it send alert reminders to both of your phones.  It is really easy to setup.   He won't be able to forget or deny in the future.", "So he doesn't like using any of the tools that would help make sure there's no miscommunication between the two of you, but he's just fine claiming you didn't say something when you actually did.\n\nMy eyes have rolled back so deep into my head I can see my neurons misfiring.", "My dad has dementia and earlier on when he would start to forget things, he would get mad when he felt like he was being coddled or accused of forgetting things. To some people with dementia, they are convinced they are right. I know that different people present differently with dementia, but for my dad, anger was his go to emotion. So I can some elements of that in here\u2026.\n\nHowever, OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t sound like he has a memory issue. Otherwise he would be having problems with forgetting different  things and not just picking the kids up from school. He seems to magically forget this one specific task.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "OP is an example of a normal person with imperfect memory. She isn\u2019t gaslighting her husband that these conversations DEFINITELY happened because she realises she\u2019s faillible.\n\nIf the husband was just having memory issues and not also gaslighting her, he\u2019d say \u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember having that talk\u201d not refuse to acknowledge the possibility he forgot. \n\nHe also would be the one taking notes, not gaslighting OP into wondering if she\u2019s an asshole for doing so herself.", "Well he even gaslighted the text she showed him", "The folks that operate that way, count on that feeling. The feeling of 'I must be mistaken because they seem so sure!', or 'Well, I do forget things...'. It's not real. I'm happy that you're getting the answers that you need!", "It is a test, of how much your husband can get away with", "Then it's not a you issue. This is a him issue, but whether it's intentional or not remains to be seen. However, my SO had a traumatic brain injury that affects his memory. When I remind him of conversations we've had that he doesn't remember, he accepts my version of things. Especially when I have receipts to show him. That your husband argued with you even after seeing black and white proof he was wrong, to me, means that this is on purpose and malicious", "True.  I guess I lean to thinking he is abusive and manipulative, and not requiring a medical check up either.", "Or you over-explained because you\u2019ve grown accustomed to being deliberately misunderstood and shut down, and you\u2019ve started blaming yourself for what you can only assume is your own failure to communicate clearly enough, because it\u2019s unfathomable that someone close to you might actually *want* you to feel small and stupid.", "Is that another thing he tells byou-- that you are not concise?? (", "You have a good friend who can see what\u2019s going on. Make sure you keep her in the loop with what\u2019s going on.", "I have to wonder how your husband behaves at these D&D nights if his only friends are worried that he\u2019s abusing you.", "Is it your \"quirks\" or your \"professional skills\"\n\nMake a positive comment about yourself girl", ">He will not even take an aspirin or use Neosporin on cuts.\n\nplenty of guys like to be tough and won't take a single painkiller but will snort coke and do roids lol well ive known a lot like that especially in my younger more adventurous days!", "> If the husband was just having memory issues and not also gaslighting her, he\u2019d say \u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember having that talk\u201d not refuse to acknowledge the possibility he forgot.\n\nOh, heck no.  I\u2019ve known way too many people with Alzheimers, Frontotemporal Dementia, Lewy body dementia and long term micro stroke damage resulting in brain injury.\n\nThe Majority of them refused to admit to anyone that they were having memory problems.  Until they were forced to by incontrovertible evidence by outside parties.  And even then it could take months.\n\nHe\u2019s probably just abusive, sure.\n\nBut people with developing brain deficits Often don\u2019t admit there\u2019s a problem, especially men.", "Oh, he probably is. The whole thing about denying texts right in front of him is the kicker. And I say that when I am usually way to willing to give people the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBut if she does want him to get checked out \u201cjust in case\u201d it would probably be easier if they both get checked out.", "Lol oh yeah. He says he prefers very short responses from me. Yesterday he asked me what time our D&D session was and I said \u201cit\u2019s at noon - did you want\u2026\u201d and I was going to ask if he wanted me to pack a snack and he cut me off and said he JUST wanted the answer to the question, and not my normal rambling.", "There was one incident where my husband insinuated he wanted me to do something specific (stop playing a video game) because he disliked it, and one of them said something to the effect of \u201cif she stops doing something she enjoys because you are strongly insinuating she do so, I will be very disappointed in you as a friend.\u201d", "The most positive thing I can say is that I am very valued by my workplace and my peers and I have established fantastic relationships with my coworkers because I am good at my job and also try to be a good human as well.", "The other day a guy that I work with was lecturing me that I should drink water instead of having of having a red bull in the morning, since it would be healthier for me. He said this while smoking a cigarette.", "And the thing is that it's really important to get treated as soon as possible.  Delaying makes things much worse.", "Yeah the thing about memory problems is it\u2019s scary and fear makes people not their best.", "Oh my gosh op that is so rude!  I don't even speak like that to people I actively dislike and you're his partner!\nOp please take your friend up on a place to crash, you really deserve better", "How would you feel if one of your kids had a spouse who spoke to them like this?", "Your husband is such an AH.  That answer is full of contempt for you.  Please when you are ready, escape to your friend's house.", "Why are you with him? Seriously - what positives does he introduce into your life?", "Um... it sounds like he doesn't even like you. He insults you, gaslight you, cuts you off and refuses to take accountability for creating better communication. He wants to \"win\" your conversations, even though it is ruining the relationship. This guy isn't committed to this marriage. Be careful.", "Damn, he\u2019s not even especially careful about where and when he bullies you. \n\nThis must have started very, very slowly. Or, and I hope this isn\u2019t true, you came from a household that treated you *worse*, and his particular brand of shittiness didn\u2019t seem all that alarming in comparison.", "So you are only forgetful at home? only lack conciseness at home, only lack proper communication at home, Do you see a pattern here??", "LMAO yeah my brother won't have 2 nurofen for an epic neck or headache, btu will smoke, vape, and god knows what else all weekend lol", "I would be upset. I don\u2019t know why I think/thought it\u2019s okay for myself but not for others. This entire discussion really has me examining some very not-great parts of myself. I am smart but I sure do think dumb things.", "Stop making excuses for him. You deserve better than to be lied to and manipulated to the point that you no longer trust your own memory or feelings about things, even when you have concrete evidence of what actually happened. And you are so focused on coddling him and avoiding upsetting him that you can\u2019t even give yourself the space to be annoyed that he drops the ball on things so frequently and then blames you for it. You need counseling, OP.\n\nTalk with your friend, let them help you come to understand what is wrong with this situation. When people who care about you express concern, take it seriously. The world does not revolve around your husband and what he thinks and says. You need someone outside your marriage to help you get back in touch with what is reasonable and fair, because you have been manipulated into a highly distorted point of view that only serves your husband. Please let people help you.", "It is NOT YOU!!! You have proof of that based on his response to the evidence that he is either forgetting or *lying* about your conversations. A normal person would be perturbed and confused that your recollections differed. Not angry!", "No he just cares about his work and he doesn't care about you.", "I think it's important to take a hard look inwards and your marriage, but remember to still be kind to yourself. It's always easier for outsiders to spot things that we're blind to. Good luck!", "I just watched the 1940's movie called \"Gaslight\".  The husband was doing all the things your husband is doing to you.  He gave her a family brooch and she put it in her purse.  He later asked to have it to have the clasp fixed.  It was gone.  She felt horrible.  Then things got worse and worse.  He even had conversations with his wife then claimed they never happened.  Finally, without giving away the plot, she found the broock in a locked room along with alll the other things he claimed she lost.  He even screamed at her for \"losing\" things and tried to convince her she put those things in the locked room she didn't have a key to.", "Make a comment that is a negative truth about him that isn't hedged by outting yourself down, eh", "I hope that day comes soon for you <3"]}
