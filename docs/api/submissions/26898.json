We have been married for 8 years and have a 12 yo son together. \n\nAbout 6 years ago, my wife decided to go vegan. She was sent the documentary Dominion by a vegan friend of hers and ever since has said nonvegan food is \"revolting\" and refuses to eat it. After a long conversation I agreed to go vegetarian and be vegan in the house and around her, which she was happy with. She also decided our son should be vegan, which after seeing a dietician I also agreed with. Things have been fine with this arrangement until a few months ago when I began finding wrappers from nonvegan candy and even burgers from McDonald's in my sons school bag which he had been buying with chore money.\n\nI had a conversation with my son and he confessed he felt lonely and excluded eating vegan around his friends and that they always had much better candy than he did and it wasn't fair. I decided I didn't want him spending his pocket money on snacks and throwing out the vegan snacks we actually brought him instead of buying games etc, it made no sense, but I also know the way my wife feels about nonvegan products. So, I began buying my son what he wanted on our way to football practise instead.\n\nLong story short, my wife recently found out what has been going on and completely flipped out. She called me an animal abuse enabler and a few other names and said I was corrupting our son. Now she is not speaking to me, our son panicked and told her I had bought the snacks for him and he didn't know they weren't vegan (I don't blame him for that, he just doesn't want to be in trouble with mom)\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1694764725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16j747y/aita_for_giving_my_son_nonvegan_food_behind_my/", "score": 17864, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Support your son's choices openly and if she goes to war over this, you need to support your son and not her. Also, veganism isn't morally superior.

Every single one of them had a phase around your son's age of wanting to eat meat/non-vegetarian food/sweets. \n\nThe kids whose parents went ballistic at them when they found out, forbidding them to eat what they wanted: those kids were unhappy growing up, had a weird and disordered attitude to food and eating in secret (which is a much worse and lasting impact than \"eating burgers\").

What matters much more is that he is happy, and has a healthy attitude to food: you're a good parent, and ensuring that happens, the minute you found evidence that he *was* struggling with wanting to eat non-vegan food. Your wife on the other hand, is being extremely unreasonable about something that is *very* normal, and if she has her own way your son will end up having serious issues around food - not because he was raised vegetarian, but because he has been made to associate food with guilt, shame, and secrecy.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to veganism, btw. I've had several Muslim/Jewish friends growing up whose families kept halal or kosher - if even they, who quite literally view eating certain foods as \"sinful\" - can understand and allow their children to experiment as they know strictly forbidding them will lead to issues, I feel like someone who is a vegan for moral reasons should be able to do the same.", "NTA\n\nYour son have the right to eat what he wants, and sharing food is a part of the whole socialization process.\n\nAnd you are a animal abuse enabler, but most people are in the actual society, and it's by design and not your fault.

Period. \nI can't believe she even asked YOU to be vegetarian and vegan in the house! Is that something you're even ok with? There are extremes in every group of people and extreme vegans can be the worst. Here's a little story...\nMy now husband and I were still in the dating phase. I was vegan. He wasn't. When we would go out to eat, he would often take me to vegan places or at least places that had vegan options. He would eat vegan, but I knew he wasn't lol So his sister had been vegetarian for a long time and he enjoys vegan foods, he said. I felt bad though because I could kind of tell on more than one date that he probably wanted a burger and not tofu wings lol So anyway, we go to my friends cookout. He is a hunter and had got a deer and did whatever you do to it and it was ready to cook. So he invited everyone over for deer steaks and we all brought sides, mine being vinegar based coleslaw. Which isn't important to the story but I think vinegar based coleslaw needs more love. Ok, so we are there and there's about 30 people in the yard, friend is grilling deer, most of the guests are in local metal bands and that's how we all met so we are talking music and having some brews. I hadn't seen my husband in a bit. I'm not real clingy at parties and neither is he, we come to socialize but I literally didn't see him outside anywhere lol So I go into the house to use the bathroom and the door was slightly open so I figured nobody was in there. I walk in and see my husband...a 27 year old man at that time, eating a deer steak with his hands on the side of the bathtub LOL He was hiding from me! I guess this whole time he had been afraid of eating meat around me! He thought I'd breakup with him hahaha I was laughing so hard and told him my personal shit is not his. There's nothing wrong with him eating whatever he wants. The sigh of relief he had and the smile on his face as he went to take another bite out of that deer steak will be forever one of my favorite moments haha It turned out that he did like vegan foods but not as much as he let on lol Neither one of us are vegans now but we do eat vegan foods often because omg seitan wings from Spak Bros is where it's at. Anyway, I told this story to 2 friends of mine. Both vegan and engaged to each other. They were pissed off that I didn't break up with him or scold him! I told them it wasn't my right to tell him what to do and they encouraged me to show him Earthlings and I was like no fucking way lol Anyway, they stopped talking to me and uninvited me from their wedding. All over a deer steak in a bathroom that I didn't even eat lol Like I said, there are extreme vegans. Nothing you do is ever vegan enough in their eyes and they take it way too far. There's nothing wrong with eating that way, as long as you're healthy, but you shouldn't judge other people. 8 years of a friendship down the drain. \nBack to you.

As any kid his age, he desperately wants to fit in and feel part of the group. It is incredibly important to him. \n\nYour kid should be free to eat EVERYTHING he wants, provided it is healthy for him, and this includes non vegan products.

It is an idealistic delusion, which has absolutely no basis on reality because you can't stop these industries. But that is not the actual problem, the problem is that she is forcing you and your kid to follow her lifestyle, which she has absolutely no right to. No right. You hear me?\n\nBottomline:\n\nThe most important thing is that your kid follows a HEALTHY diet that comprises both plant based and animal based food. Don't believe vegans when they say you can get all nutrients easily on a plant based diet. It is way way easier to have a healthy diet if you eat animal food as well, and vit. D, vit. B12, iron and calcium deficiencies are easier to get on a vegan diet. I hope your wife suppplements at least? This shit is not to be taken lightly, especially B12. Your child is still developing - he needs all the best quality foods to thrive and grow properly. When he'll stop growing, it'll be safer for him to be vegan. But developing kids should never get restrictive diets.\n\nSecond, the fact that your kid feels lonely and excluded is not to be taken lightly either.

The child was engaging in secretive behaviours, so imo the OP took a sensible approach by agreeing boundaries and putting some moderation in place so the child could sensibly enjoy some non-vegan food. Being vegan is a personal choice and mom has been imposing this (somewhat tyranically from the sounds of it) on the whole family. OP is definitely NTA but finding those food wrappers should perhaps have sparked a conversation about reevaluating personal choices (without dropping the kid in it, obvs) and mom needs to understand that it's not fair to impose her choices on others. \n\nHer reaction is problematic and shows why the kid was secretive in the first place. It's building a culture of fear around the child trying to make their own choices that don't align with hers. In this instance, it's about food. But I suspect that wouldn't be the only thing and this 'my way or no way' approach is setting mom up for her kid going LC in future and posting things like 'AITA for not inviting my mom to my wedding because she'll scream at non-vegan guests' or 'AITA for not letting my mom look after my child because of her attitude about food'.\n\nI used to work with a woman who went vegan for similar reasons, and just after she 'converted' she went around the office nagging anyone she saw eating non-vegan food about the benefits of veganism and trying to guilt us all. IIRC she got into some trouble with HR over it because she'd harass people in the break room. I was one of her targets and I switched to Soy milk at work just to shut her up but after a few weeks I felt bloated and gross and switched back but to this day I still buy Soy lattes in Starbucks or Costa because I prefer the taste. Soy milk is so much creamier. It's one tiny little change that stuck. Anyway, she left not long after and the office breathed a collective sigh of relief that we wouldn't have to hear about abattoir killing floors while we were reheating our leftover bolognaise.\n\nSome time later she reached out to me on FB (before her switch she and I got on well at work) and apologised for what she called her 'activist vegan phase'. She had been going to counselling (what we call therapy here in the UK) and realised that she got swept up by all the hype and the aggressive conversion tactics of some individuals in her friendship group at the time, but things had happened and she'd put some distance between herself and those individuals for a variety of reasons and realised she'd been unfair to friends and colleagues in some of the things she said and did. She told me that she had realised that imposing her will on others was hypocrisy, since the whole vegan ethos is about /not/ forcing animals to serve our will, and how is forcing other people to do something against their will any different?\n\nOverall she seemed much happier and more chill. She was still vegan because it was a choice that mattered to her, and she was still happy to help out and share information to people who wanted to make different choices, because she wasn't going to gatekeep, but she was no longer trying to convert people and apologised for how she behaved at work. We had a good chat and actually some of the switches I made because of her have stuck - I like using shampoo bars because they're less waste and not full of weird ingredients - my hair is much softer as a result, I buy this gorgeous vegan handmade soap from a local small business and it's absolutely amazing! I still have soy milk in my starbucks because it's creamier and somehow 'thicker' than dairy milk and I enjoy it as a treat (although I am mindful of the problematic nature of soy milk farming but I just can't stand oat or almond milk). I've also made some changes around certain brands I buy and we've begun adding some meat alternatives into our diets (partly for conscientious reasons and partly because of the cost of living crisis). \n\nSo my point is that perhaps mom needs some perspective because her aggressive tactics are only serving to alienate her child and (to some extent) her partner and perhaps mom could do with some counselling/therapy?

Considering OP\u2019s wife went to a dietician, physical is probably not the dominant factor. *However*, that relies on whether the wife actually followed through in the advice, as we all know that it\u2019s one thing to go to a doctor and get their advice, and another to loyally follow it. If, for example, the doctor offered information and said \u201cas a growing boy, your son needs to feel filled up or he\u2019s going to constantly feel hunger, here\u2019s a list of vegan food items that will help do that when part of a meal\u201d, and she just assumes normal portions etc and disregards the information, then that would actually be considered abuse. Because she is putting her son in a situation where he is constantly hungry because his meals aren\u2019t filling him properly, thus causing discomfort, upset, and potentially even sickness as some people do feel ill from hunger pangs. \n\nThe main factor, however, is mental. The fact that the boy was *hiding* food from his mother suggests that perhaps the wife was going very hard in on the vegan ideaology to the point the boy clearly felt like he would not be allowed to eat non-vegan outside the house. I mean look - she let op be vegetarian, but said their son had to be straight up vegan. Depending on how old the boy was when they switched to veganism, he\u2019s likely still hooked on all the sugars and chemicals in lots of non-vegan food which make them more appealing, almost addictive. So, she\u2019s made a *child* essentially go cold turkey on many different food items that he\u2019s craving strongly. This links back to the mental, because if he\u2019s feeling hungry and he hasn\u2019t had x items in x time, he\u2019s going to be craving those, not a bowl of salad or lentils or a jacket potato with margarine and tomatoes. He\u2019s a kid. He\u2019ll want something heavy, probably greasy, and likely with some form of processed meat or cheese and a sugary drink to go. But then you also have to consider the guilt tripping - if the wife constantly espouses beliefs about how people who eat meat are terrible who support animal abuse and such, then this *child* is going to feel like absolute crap for even just wanting these items. She\u2019s basically guilt tripping him into a circle of self-loathing. There is a solid reason why a lot of people find it easier to transition to veganism if they\u2019ve already been vegetarian- it\u2019s a steep hill, not a sudden drop, it\u2019s still hard, but you\u2019re not just straight jumping in", "The child is 12, he's old enough to decide his own diet.

He hasn't said that his friends treat him differently for eating vegan, just that he himself feels that way. Saying \"I want to eat non-vegan b/c my friends eat that way\" leads to the classic parental response, \"if all your friends were jumping off a cliff, would you do that too?\" and sometimes a kid has to learn to negotiate being different. If he had food allergies, for instance, he might not be able to eat what his friends eat. Plus, part of this is clearly that he just likes his friends' non-vegan candy better, which doesn't sound like an issue for his social life, just something that makes him personally unhappy.\n\nConversely, imposing such strict limits on your kid's food based on your own preferences/choices,  such that the kid takes his own spending money to buy food and feels compelled to lie to you about it seems absolutely tailor-made to result in disordered eating in a way that can have a really long-term impact.\n\nBUT all that said, I agree that OP has been a good support to his kid, but should have raised it directly with mom rather than going behind her back. Definitely a soft Y T A b/c I get why he did it this way, but it did give mom a little bit of ammunition to say that they're behaving badly b/c they're going behind her back. And I agree that they need to sit down and work this out as a family - again in part to help this poor kid keep a reasonable relationship with food. Because it is his body/his choice what goes in it, within some limits b/c he's a minor.\n\nAs an aside, it seems kind of hypocritical of mom to agree that OP only needs to be vegan/vegetarian in the house/around her, and to flip out when her son does the same thing. I have a teeny tiny bit of sympathy b/c if she's truly committed to veganism for ethical reasons, I kind of understand her wanting him to adopt it as well. For an unrealistic example, I'd be horrified and upset if I found out my American kid, raised in the US, had been eating cat or dog. (Not trying to get into any arguments over the inconsistency of protecting the cute, fluffy animals and not the other kinds or commenting on different cultural cuisines - just looking for an example of the kind of emotional reaction mom might be having.) But unfortunately for mom, I just think that not eating animals/animal products isn't widely enough accepted as a moral imperative to give her standing to impose that viewpoint on her kid. She's within her rights to refuse to feed him or personally buy him non-vegan food, maybe also to bar it from the house altogether (though I think there'd be some debate about something like the kid keeping gummy bears or Doritos in his room). I think she has to accept though that she can't forbid or prevent him from eating non-vegan when he's away from home/her. Sure, I think she can forbid a 12 yo from having booze/drugs regardless of where (not that this will necessarily prevent it from happening), but in the eyes of the law/American society generally, for better or worse, non vegan food isn't equivalent to booze and drugs. She has some ground to ask/require him to limit it around her in respect for her beliefs, but I don't think she can make him adopt those beliefs as his own.", "The USA is really bad for veggie options.

If they have questions or want to learn more about why I choose to be vegan, I will be honest in an age appropriate way. But again, I don't feel it is my place to make that decision for them.

It sounds like she's overbearing, and everyone else has just learned to live with it. But when the son decides that he can't take it anymore, they still move to accommodate her.... instead of the growing child. His dietary choices are going to matter more now than they ever will for the rest of his life.

There are plenty of journals out there that publish anything for money, disregarding peer review (after all scientific journals are just money hungry private businesses that are not that well regulated). On top of that, even properly peer reviewed papers are mostly reviewed by non-experts on the subject because the editor for the journal couldn't manage to get in contact with an expert on the field and they don't make that a priority as their job is to finish the review process as fast as possible. The icing on the cake is that reviewers are also regular researchers, busy with their own work; they are not paid for their review and they are given tight deadlines, so there's no incentive to do a good job. \n\nI personally never take something for granted and I always critically analyze any paper (check their methods, check their reasoning, check statistical error, check calculations, etc) before I trust the conclusion. But I can do that because I'm a trained scientist. It is sad that normal people are just left to trust a corrupt journal system that cares more about money than correct results.\n\nNow, I'm not saying everything you read is wrong.
