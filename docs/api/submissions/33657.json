Based on your post and comments, it's pretty obvious the situation is that your 'friend' feels proud of speaking three languages -- which might be normal in your country but isn't the norm in general at a global scale, so it is pretty impressive -- and brags a bit about it -- which I get, it can be off putting -- and you, who speak one more language than him, felt the need to brush it off quite aggressively and let him know that actually *you* are better than him therefore unimpressed, so he shouldn't brag about it. If bragging is indeed off-putting and a bad look, you clearly have an issue with him feeling good and proud of himself for something you feel you're better at, which is way worse if he's your friend.
