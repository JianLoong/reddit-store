Upon this comment I looked at my sister and raised my eyebrows (she knew I was asking, were somewhat telepathic lol). She simply responded with \u201cyou\u2019re all the same, you and the girls are all the same\u201d. \n\nLong story short she\u2019s not having a maid of honour because she thinks it\u2019s not fair on her best friends.

So now you're going to kick up a whole mess of unnecessary drama, thereby proving your unsuitability for the role even if she gave it to you.

Were you always the attention-seeking taker- or is just bridesmaidzilla (look at me, but I am not about the attention. honest. Just look at me, tell me how special I am- not that I am blackmailing you for it)", "Good point. \n\nI think for me the issue is not: \u201cI won\u2019t be maid of honour at the ceremony\u201d (I really don\u2019t give a toss about what people not close to me think)\n\nI think it\u2019s more: why wouldn\u2019t she WANT me to be, even if she had said \u201cyou\u2019re my only sister but I think the whole MOH concept is stupid so I\u2019m not having one\u201d i\u2019d be handling it differently.  The devil on my shoulder feels like she wanted one but genuinely doesn\u2019t consider me any different from her friends  in turn I think triggering feelings of \u201cnot good enough\u201d and \u201cinvalidating\u201d what I thought our bond was", "I literally just said idc for the ceremony we could all dress and look the exact same \ud83e\udd23", "You're tying yourself up in knots and contradicting yourself all over the place.\n\nYour other comments show that you ARE bothered that you're not MoH, but admit that your reaction to this is dictated by your own insecurities. So, you need to own your feelings and consider this an opportunity to help yourself.", "From your reaction, nobody believes you do not care. Everything about your post screams \"look at me, tell me how special I am. why do you not validate how special I am?\". YTA", "Then why are you on Reddit bitching that you don\u2019t have a special part in your sisters wedding? You should just stop already\u2026", "I\u2019m just trying to explain to those who don\u2019t understand that my concern is not the ceremony itself, I don\u2019t care about title or appearance. My concern is what does my Sister feel about me that has lead to this", "She doesn\u2019t care so much she made a whole post on Reddit crying about it. Can\u2019t you see how cool OP is about all this? /s", "Because I wanted to vent my feelings anonymously.., that\u2019s literally the purpose of Reddit\u2026\n\nNot to say there\u2019s many people who have disagreed with me in the comments without feeling the need to try condescend.. but do you\u2026", ">My concern is what does my Sister feel about me that has lead to this\n\nShe feels that you're her dear sister, who has been by her side through all the shit that life has thrown at you and she LOVES you.\n\nThis MoH situation does not negate any of that. Not being given the MoH role doesn't mean that you've been 'downgraded' to the level of her friends, it means that she doesn't want a MoH and she's been very clear as to why that is.\n\nIt is not about you.", "she will NOT feel good about you if you throw a tantrum and leave the group to try to manipulate her into making you MOH. fucking chill.", "It sounds like the issue for your sister is more about MOHs than you. She's choosing not to have one and instead just to have a group of bridesmaids for precisely the reason that she doesn't want to pick one bridesmaid (you, you could assume) over the others.", "I think you\u2019re navigating your feelings of hurt and rejection very maturely.  \n\nYou\u2019re not acting impulsively, you\u2019ve not thrown a tantrum, and you\u2019re processing things by coming here to throw your thoughts out. \n\nI think people are being very unkind considering that you\u2019ve done nothing AHish to your sister yet. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having this experience. Please do your best to support your sister with any title that you\u2019re given. \n\nHappy holidays.\n\nNAH.", "You said I can\u2019t read and then called me condescending lmfao. No wonder you\u2019re not the maid of honor\u2026 hahahahaha", "For venting your feelings -> trueofmychest\n\nAITA is for moral judgement.\n\nSome people may be to harsh in expressing their point, but perhaps you chose the wrong place?", "This is the wrong sub for that, you came to a sub that\u2019s all about judgement.", "It's fine to feel that way but as other ppl have said, you should think why you feel this way and have a real talk with your sister, I'm sure she loves you as much you love her.", "I haven\u2019t thrown a tantrum and left the group\u2026  that\u2019s why I came here to discuss without acting brashly\u2026", "I thought discussing here would help but I think I\u2019ll save it next time \ud83e\udd23 People acting as though ive acted on my feels but that\u2019s the whole reason I\u2019m here. \n\nThank you. I think I\u2019ll shout a different thread next time. \n\nHappy holidays to you too", "Maybe you\u2019re right \ud83e\udd23 Tbh for the most part there has been constructive feedback. \n\nIt\u2019s ok, if she wants to come on a thread dedicated to bitching but doesn\u2019t wanna hear bitching then no wonder she\u2019s stressed out. AITA is literally dedicated to debating who\u2019s the asshole."]}
