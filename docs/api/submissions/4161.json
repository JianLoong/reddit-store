I always looked forward to it. \n\nMy problem - we were having dinner the other night where her fianc\u00e9 mentioned he wasn\u2019t choosing a certain friend as best man because said friend and his brother were each others best men. Upon this comment I looked at my sister and raised my eyebrows (she knew I was asking, were somewhat telepathic lol). She simply responded with \u201cyou\u2019re all the same, you and the girls are all the same\u201d. \n\nLong story short she\u2019s not having a maid of honour because she thinks it\u2019s not fair on her best friends. After all we\u2019ve been through, especially growing up it\u2019s always been US two against the world, she was ALWAYS the only option for me.

You're entitled to your feelings, but your sister is entitled to choose these things for herself without being guilted into changing her mind.\n\nYou mentioned over and over that you're hurt that your sister sees you the same as her friends, and that your relationship isn't special. That sounds like rejection sensitive dysforia (RSD) and it's common in people with ADHD and/or PTSD or trauma. It makes even small perceived slights or insults incredibly painful. What you feel because of it is very real, but also disproportionate. Could you try to look at the situation a little differently? You clearly love your sister so very much, and you want all the best things for her, so maybe try looking at it from the perspective of how wonderful it is that she's found friends with whom she has a relationship and a bond as strong and deep as what the two of you share.\n\nLove is a wonderful thing, because it isn't diminished by loving others. When a parent has a second child the love they have for their first isn't halved, for half to go to the new child; a child with 2 siblings doesn't love each sibling half as much as a child with one sibling does. And your sister doesn't love you less because she has friends she loves, too.\n\nYou're clearly deeply hurt by all this, but please remember that this isn't anyone's fault. Not your sister's, not yours. But if you act the way you described wanting to act, you'll end up causing both of you even more hurt, and you'd be doing so as retaliation, so it would be your fault.\n\nAsk your sister to spend time with you doing the things you love doing together.

To her, doing so would make her similar to the absent parents who wounded you both. You are both coming from a place of deeply rooted insecurities, but it's showing itself just a little differently. You need to work through your issues without piling them onto your sister who is dealing with her own issues on top of planning a wedding.  If you love her as much as you say, don't make her special day less special by acting as though she has hurt her sister deeply when she is likely trying so hard not to hurt ANYONE.  Lastly, I think you need to ask yourself if the wedding itself is triggering you? Has it made you feel at all worried that you are losing a part of your sister to someone else? If you can, therapy would be very helpful to you in working through your childhood trauma. If therapy is unreachable, some meditation and self reflection might be useful. Either way, it's up to you to feel confident in the love of your sister.", "Honestly OP I think this is all a sign to consider therapy.

But if you're as close as you say you are to the Bride, adding being sisters on top of that, AND seeing the groom claim a bestman, then you're certainly allowed to feel hurt by the notion. It could just be that she has a very passive personality and she doesn't want to offend anyone, or she doesn't see you the same way that you see her.

Maybe you two make plans to spend one-on-one time together doing wedding things (understanding she may also do solo things with other friends). Honestly if I were a high-control type bride, I wouldn\u2019t want an MoH getting all up in my stuff.

I still stand by my ruling that YTA for the childish way you\u2019re responding to this. \n\nThat being said, on further reflection, I don\u2019t think this is about the title at all.\n\nYou\u2019re scared and feeling threatened. NOT because of the best friends- they actually have nothing to do with it on your end at all. Not even because of the title/role of MOH\u2026 and you pointed out in your post, you **already** have a unique and important role in your sister\u2019s life: you\u2019re her \u201cONLY SISTER EVER\u201d, so an additional title to detail how special you are is superfluous.\n\nThe reason you\u2019re scared is because, consciously or not, you know your status in your sister\u2019s life is changing. You\u2019re not her only family anymore. You\u2019re not the only one she loves. You\u2019re not her first priority. (Neither are her best friends). She\u2019s *getting married!* So her husband will be her #1. If she has kids, they will also take priority over you. That doesn\u2019t mean she will love you any less, she just won\u2019t have as much time or focus to dedicate to you and your relationship. This is natural, this is normal. It can still be a hard adjustment and it\u2019s okay for you to privately grieve the change because you haven\u2019t developed those other relationships in your life yet. BUT, if you do love her and value her as much as you claim, you need to come to terms with this. Giving her the silent treatment, dropping out of bridesmaid group chats, resenting her friends- all of that is just you harming the relationship. Doing that is like the stereotypical MIL who hates the bride because the bride is \u201cstealing\u201d the groom from his mommy. Don\u2019t be that person. Recognize that change is hard, but is expected and natural and good. \n\nI think you\u2019re upset about not being named MOH because the title gave you status- you\u2019d be right by the bride at the ceremony and head table. It\u2019d be visible \u201cproof\u201d that you\u2019re still just as important in her life. But you see, that\u2019s not actually true. The MOH still doesn\u2019t trump the groom. You\u2019d still be down a step from where you were. She doesn\u2019t want to rank you. She just wants her ladies by her side- all together to support her as she marries her number one. Your sister hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. She\u2019s not prioritizing her friends over you. You\u2019re still her one and only sister and you will forever hold that title. How you treat it is up to you. \n\nI suggest therapy to address your feelings of grief. A therapist can also help you figure out how to talk to your sister about this so she can understand you and maybe even reassure you, without you unfairly blaming her. And until you come to terms with it, do your best to \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it\u201d for the sake of your sister.

During my birthday party that year (just a few months before she was due) she took me aside and told me that she had chosen another friend of hers to be godmother (a friend who had two children of her own and that she had known about 3 years at that point). I stayed calmed and told her I kind of expected she would ask me and she told me that she felt more confident in the ability of that other friend to really give her daughter the kind of attention she deserved from a godmother (my friend's own godmother has always been a huge part of her life (she calls her Magic Fairy godmother) and she expected her own child to be treated exactly the same way she was (but her godmother didn't have children of her own and she devoted her entire life to her goddaughter while I have two step children in my life (so not my own flesh and blood) and I'm very dedicated to my work and don't live super close to them (about 45 min drive)). I could understand that she wanted her daughter to have what she had but it made me really sad that she didn't trust that I could be that for her child and that she would tell me this.......on my birthday. \n\nBut I graciously accepted her words, told her it was her choice and if she felt this was the best choice for her child than I was happy for her (I'm not jealous of the other woman, she's a terrific person and she's an amazing godmother, I just pointed out the time my friend knew her to highlight why I \"felt\" entitled to the title). I'm still hurt about this years later and my relationship with my friend (and her daughter) has been strained. The girl is always happy to see me come around and I always bring gifts but I don't feel any special need to step up and be an over the top, extra awesome person in her life (one because I don't want to overshadow the other lady but also, I'm a little petty about not being trusted in the first place. Why should I go the extra mile and have to prove my friend's assumptions wrong?) \n\nAnyway, all this to say, she doesn't owe you the title but it's fair for you to be hurt and it wouldn't be surprising if this causes a distance to set in between you two. Clearly, she's more important to you than you are to her.", "This. I made both my sisters and my SIL my bridesmaids. Everyone was happy.
