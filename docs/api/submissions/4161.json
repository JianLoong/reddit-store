It's natural you're upset about this.\n\nThat being said, if you did leave the group or bring this up to your sister it would be the wrong thing to do. You're entitled to your feelings, but your sister is entitled to choose these things for herself without being guilted into changing her mind.\n\nYou mentioned over and over that you're hurt that your sister sees you the same as her friends, and that your relationship isn't special. That sounds like rejection sensitive dysforia (RSD) and it's common in people with ADHD and/or PTSD or trauma. It makes even small perceived slights or insults incredibly painful. What you feel because of it is very real, but also disproportionate. Could you try to look at the situation a little differently? You clearly love your sister so very much, and you want all the best things for her, so maybe try looking at it from the perspective of how wonderful it is that she's found friends with whom she has a relationship and a bond as strong and deep as what the two of you share.\n\nLove is a wonderful thing, because it isn't diminished by loving others. When a parent has a second child the love they have for their first isn't halved, for half to go to the new child; a child with 2 siblings doesn't love each sibling half as much as a child with one sibling does. And your sister doesn't love you less because she has friends she loves, too.\n\nYou're clearly deeply hurt by all this, but please remember that this isn't anyone's fault. Not your sister's, not yours. But if you act the way you described wanting to act, you'll end up causing both of you even more hurt, and you'd be doing so as retaliation, so it would be your fault.\n\nAsk your sister to spend time with you doing the things you love doing together.

So for example \u201cwhen you explained that you don\u2019t want a MOH, it made me feel and think this way [insert thoughts and feelings like: you see our relationship differently than I]. Can you share how you see our relationship? (For example)\n\nI hope this helps", "And she's allowed to feel bad about it... sister can make her decisions but they have concequences", "You are projecting your insecurities onto your sister. Those are a YOU problem, not a HER problem. Is it possible that because of the lack of positive parental roles in your childhood that you have some fear of abandonment? Or maybe there is a lingering sense of, \"Why wasn't I good enough for my own mother to love me? Is there something about me that makes it easy to throw me away?\" I doubt that you two survived such a difficult upbringing without some lingering emotional scars. \n\nNow imagine that the same fears and doubts that are itching at you are present in your sister. You don't like feeling less important to someone that you love dearly. It brings up old pain for you. She doesn't like the idea of making Anyone she cares for feel like they are somehow lesser. To her, doing so would make her similar to the absent parents who wounded you both. You are both coming from a place of deeply rooted insecurities, but it's showing itself just a little differently. You need to work through your issues without piling them onto your sister who is dealing with her own issues on top of planning a wedding.  If you love her as much as you say, don't make her special day less special by acting as though she has hurt her sister deeply when she is likely trying so hard not to hurt ANYONE.  Lastly, I think you need to ask yourself if the wedding itself is triggering you? Has it made you feel at all worried that you are losing a part of your sister to someone else? If you can, therapy would be very helpful to you in working through your childhood trauma. If therapy is unreachable, some meditation and self reflection might be useful. Either way, it's up to you to feel confident in the love of your sister.", "Honestly OP I think this is all a sign to consider therapy. I feel like you\u2019re struggling with a lot of emotions that you think have to do about how your sister feels about you, when maybe in reality they are about how you feel about you. You said it yourself OP, this is just between the sister and you\u2026 but more-so I think this is revealing insights into your relationship with yourself and being good enough for you. I understand you\u2019re disappointed and that\u2019s totally fair but YTA for not being able to move on with that and it sounds to me that there are other things lying under the surface that could be worth picking apart in therapy.", "Hey there, you're not an AH (yet). I don't want to be hard on you because I see some people aren't understanding what you mean. You're upset about the principle that she didn't pick you, because you're not just only sisters but best friend's. The thing is I don't think she's deliberately NOT choosing you, she values her friendships so much and your relationship as sisters she doesn't want anyone to feel left out so she's trying to treat you all equally hence the group chat. Don't feel bad and don't make it into a big thing with her. You can sit down and speak with her about your feelings and to get some clarification. I guarantee you she has no idea you're hurt in anyway. I understand your insecurities in the situation and don't think you're an asshole, I just think you're reading into it to much. Just support her love her and give her the best day possible no matter how she chooses to celebrate it. You know she loves you, so don't let it bother you. Really! I wish you the best and I hope your sister has a great wedding and you all have fun! \ud83c\udf8a \ud83c\udf89  \ud83d\ude00", "Of course she's allowed, but she's not allowed to make her sister feel miserable and force her to change her mind by wanting a better title than the rest.", "I can agree that OP is perfectly entitled to her feelings but I don't get the \"consequences\" bit.  Op isn't owed anything just on virtue of being her sister.  She's not being denied something she's obligated to have.  So what \"consequences\" are to be expected?", "Honestly this is the most helpful YTA I got. Thank you. This certainly brings things a bit more clearly into perspective. Damn.", "\\^\\^ This, best comment I read on Reddit since a long time.", "And thank you btw! :)", "I don\u2019t know. The general response has me thinking I must be. \n\nTbh that\u2019s the reason I haven\u2019t acted or spoken on my feelings yet. I absolutely know she loves me and I know it\u2019s not ABOUT me. I don\u2019t know, I think given my insecurities the best thing to do is just explain my insecurities to her without making her feel in any way responsible, and just get clarification that it IS just that and not symptomatic of a deeper issue (which is clearly what I\u2019m scared of). \n\nI appreciate you not jumping to conclusions and understanding where I\u2019m coming from. Cause God knows regardless I will be the first to make sure no one ruins her day, me included. Just don\u2019t want it to be a problem bigger than the wedding day.", "> but she's not allowed to make her sister feel miserable and force her to change her mind by wanting a better title than the rest.\n\nBut she never did?? She never even told her sister, but she will be hurt and their bond may suffer because of it", "The consequences are that her sister will resent her, this cannot Be avoided", "SHE FEELS LIKE SHE DOESNT WANT A MOH. IT\u2019S NOT ABOUT YOU. \n\nSorry to yell but you\u2019re really not hearing it\u2026", "For the umpteenth time:\n\nIt. Is. Not. About. You. \n\nIt has nothing to do with what she feels about you, and everything to do with how she feels about wedding traditions. She doesn't want to do it. The end. She still loves you just as much as she always has, but she doesn't want a maid of honor. This whole post reeks of \"me me me\", *your* feelings are hurt, but you haven't stopped for a single minute to think about how your sister feels. Stop being so self-centered and listen to what your sister is saying and feeling.", "Again. This has literally nothing to do with you or how your suster feels about you. This is al about the wedding and how she feels about the wedding.", "For what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for how you feel, I think how you feel is super normal. I think this is one of those times where what you do matters a lot more than how you feel. You know it\u2019s her wedding, and you know that you gets to make the choice. You\u2019re not wrong or bad for how you feel. Just in my opinion you\u2019ve gotta either keep your feelings quiet on this one or tell her like \u201cI feel/felt insignificant when you told me that you don\u2019t want a maid of honor because we\u2019re all the same, I feel like our sister bond has been I validated, whatever, can we talk about this because I know we\u2019re super close. But definitely I think you\u2019d be the ah if you made this into something bad she did, but not if you just talk in a neutral way and definitely not just for feeling how you feel.", "It\u2019s ok \ud83e\udd23 nothing wrong with directness, \n\nMaybe I write this on postits until my brain comes to terms with it, this is what the majority of comments have said"]}
