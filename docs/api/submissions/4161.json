I always looked forward to it. \n\nMy problem - we were having dinner the other night where her fianc\u00e9 mentioned he wasn\u2019t choosing a certain friend as best man because said friend and his brother were each others best men. Upon this comment I looked at my sister and raised my eyebrows (she knew I was asking, were somewhat telepathic lol). She simply responded with \u201cyou\u2019re all the same, you and the girls are all the same\u201d. \n\nLong story short she\u2019s not having a maid of honour because she thinks it\u2019s not fair on her best friends.

You're entitled to your feelings, but your sister is entitled to choose these things for herself without being guilted into changing her mind.\n\nYou mentioned over and over that you're hurt that your sister sees you the same as her friends, and that your relationship isn't special. That sounds like rejection sensitive dysforia (RSD) and it's common in people with ADHD and/or PTSD or trauma. It makes even small perceived slights or insults incredibly painful. What you feel because of it is very real, but also disproportionate. Could you try to look at the situation a little differently? You clearly love your sister so very much, and you want all the best things for her, so maybe try looking at it from the perspective of how wonderful it is that she's found friends with whom she has a relationship and a bond as strong and deep as what the two of you share.\n\nLove is a wonderful thing, because it isn't diminished by loving others. When a parent has a second child the love they have for their first isn't halved, for half to go to the new child; a child with 2 siblings doesn't love each sibling half as much as a child with one sibling does. And your sister doesn't love you less because she has friends she loves, too.\n\nYou're clearly deeply hurt by all this, but please remember that this isn't anyone's fault. Not your sister's, not yours. But if you act the way you described wanting to act, you'll end up causing both of you even more hurt, and you'd be doing so as retaliation, so it would be your fault.\n\nAsk your sister to spend time with you doing the things you love doing together.

To her, doing so would make her similar to the absent parents who wounded you both. You are both coming from a place of deeply rooted insecurities, but it's showing itself just a little differently. You need to work through your issues without piling them onto your sister who is dealing with her own issues on top of planning a wedding.  If you love her as much as you say, don't make her special day less special by acting as though she has hurt her sister deeply when she is likely trying so hard not to hurt ANYONE.  Lastly, I think you need to ask yourself if the wedding itself is triggering you? Has it made you feel at all worried that you are losing a part of your sister to someone else? If you can, therapy would be very helpful to you in working through your childhood trauma. If therapy is unreachable, some meditation and self reflection might be useful. Either way, it's up to you to feel confident in the love of your sister.", "Honestly OP I think this is all a sign to consider therapy.

But that doesn't mean she doesn't have a very close, in a completely different way, Relationship with her best friend. People can have more than one \"best friend\" and it's perfectly acceptable to not want to place one above the other.", "INFO: Are you saying that the groom has a bestman and groomsmen, but the bride has only bridesmaids and no maid of honor?\n\nUnpopular, but I'm leaning towards N A H. Bride and Groom are certainly welcome to make their party however they want and ultimately, you don't get to have final say. But if you're as close as you say you are to the Bride, adding being sisters on top of that, AND seeing the groom claim a bestman, then you're certainly allowed to feel hurt by the notion. It could just be that she has a very passive personality and she doesn't want to offend anyone, or she doesn't see you the same way that you see her. If you love and cherish your sister as much as you say you do, I don't think you should back out of the wedding just to hurt her.", "I\u2019m going to hazard a guess this isn\u2019t about being Maid of Honour. It\u2019s about not being the most important person in your sisters life anymore as she starts to make her own family with her husband. And needing some validation that you still matter. \n\nIt is possible to both be happy for her and find it difficult to adjust to it not just being you two anymore. \n\nThis is the conversation to have with your sister. And might be why she avoided telling you directly.\n\nIt won\u2019t mean she loves you any less. Just that you\u2019re both growing up. \n\nNAH as your reaction is very human given how you two grew up. And you\u2019ve come here rather than to your sister.", "YTA.\n\nAs you've put it, you've lived your lives being each other's constant. You have your lifetimes of memories and such a strong bond that you're letting a very meaningless role come between that. And that speaks more of your perspective of your relationship with your sister.\n\nI'm not saying MOH is a meaningless role but your sister obviously doesn't share the same view as you in terms of that role. It's actually a really hard work role. Your sister will still include you in everything but why lump one person with all the duties when it can be divided and enjoyed better by you all?\n\nTraditionally, the MOH is also a married woman who can offer the bride-to-be life advice for their wedding and marriage. It really isn't the big deal you're making it out be but I can see why you're upset. \n\nDon't be petty and leave the group. Your sister did give you an explanation but you don't like it so aren't accepting it of it. Talk with your sister but don't be upset at her for your feelings because you clearly have different opinions on wedding planning and the MOH role.", "YTA. Grow up. I work in the wedding industry. LOTS of couples don\u2019t have a maid of honor or best man- they just have bridesmaids and groomsmen.\n\nYou sound narcissistic- you want a special title so you\u2019re superior to the others. Newsflash: her wedding is not about you. You\u2019re including in a small group of some who are already elevated above all the guests. That should be enough.", "YTA. The point of having bridesmaids is for support and to help the bride with the stressors of wedding planning etc and to support her on the day. \n\nIt sounds like to you, moh is some sort of badge to flaunt. You can still support your sister, why are you so fixated on which title you have?", "YTA. Very selfish and egotistical to think you are that special.", "r/iamthemaincharacter\nYTA", "NTA \n\nyou can't tell your sister what to do, but it is ok to be disappointed. I would feel upset too because its like she sees your all's relationship differently than you see it. It sounds like she knew you expected to be MOH because she knew what you were asking as soon as you raised your eyebrows.\n\nIt is her call because its her wedding, but I can see why you feel the way you do.", "NTA You are more special than her other friends. You\u2019re her sister. Family is everything.", "NTA, I see a lot of comments on how it is her sister's wedding and her wedding party. \n\nHowever, I have been in this situation, I was not the maid of honor or even a bridesmaid for my twin sister. Nor was a later a godmother to her daughter. She was my only bridesmaid and the godmother to my eldest daughter. \n\nIt is only with years of hindsight and distancing myself from her that I can see that this as the perfect example of our relationship dynamics. She treats me as if I were not important to her and I treat her as my best friend. \n\nDraw your conclusions. You are not the asshole here, but you need to have a good look at your relationship with your sister.", "OP, you and the bridesmaids are going to have a better time of it this way. MOH is a ton of work. This way you can divvy up the work and have fun doing all the things MOH wipes themself out doing.", "Just make sure she doesn\u2019t expect you to do everything for the wedding. If you are all equal, the responsibilities should be divided evenly among you.", "This. The solution is to work on creating her own \u201cbest life\u201d. Granted this may be hard because when you come from a dysfunctional background some people come out more ok than others. It may be hard for her, but for her own well being she needs to put in the effort.", "Really hit home for me when she said \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> it\u2019s always been US two against the world, she was ALWAYS the only option for me. \n\nI'd do the same thing.  Most people on this sub are like \"its one day\" give the bride whatever she wants... but it's not just one day. It's many days, weeks, and often months... of planning, organizing, lots of time, effort and money.  And for you to have to just smile and act like everything's okay when you realize your sister never really loved you as much as you love her.... that's a bit much. That's a bit much for the sister to expect.  Should OP decide to bow out, I hope the sister just understands, and respects her decision.  I also hope OP continues to love and support her sister in whatever way she can, and try not to hold it against her.", "I agree ESH. The sister barely came up with a reason and if the fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t say anything, I doubt the sister would have broached the subject. Which is just shitty imo, be an adult and use your words. But it is her wedding party and she can choose to set it up however she likes.\n\nIf you\u2019re only a bridesmaid, don\u2019t put in anything more that the basics. Your sister choices have shown that both of you perceive the relationship differently.", "YTA. Keep not saying anything. By saying something you\u2019re making it about you. She doesn\u2019t want the drama associated with choosing a maid of honor. You\u2019ve been a sister and a surrogate mother. You don\u2019t need to add another title. Let this be about her and not the two of you. I\u2019ve read all of your responses and you\u2019re majorly overreacting about this. \n\n- Leaving a group chat - dramatic\n\n- Deciding that her choice for a wedding party has anything to do with the status of your relationship - dramatic\n\n- Having a calm understanding conversation about why she\u2019s not choosing to have a MOH - reasonable, but how you respond is important. Accept the answer. She doesn\u2019t even owe you one, but she probably loves you enough to be honest with you anyway.", "YEs you do, that's literally what the post is about.", "YTA stop making it about you then", "It IS deep and special, but some people just don\u2019t want to have a MOH, and that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re still a bridesmaid, which is a high honor anyway. I understand why you\u2019d be upset but it isn\u2019t meaning what you think it means. She still loves you and values you.\n\nFor the sake of the post, YTA, but I really think it\u2019s just a matter of communication.", "if you feel this way then help to make her wedding a memorable and happy occasion by supporting her in healthy ways. you can either grow even closer or farther by the way you react. You think you\u2019re sisters not going to remember and cherish how you helped make her wedding a fantastic time in her life?", "Wow, this is some manipulative shit.", "You must be the younger sister?", "That\u2019s\u2026. That\u2019s not what that person was saying. She can love you just as much as you love her without having to add more titles to her wedding. I think you need to read all the comments and sleep on this for a couple nights.", "Your sister isn\u2019t being half hearted because she doesn\u2019t want you as a MOH. My sisters and I had rough upbringings. My middle sister and I were always emotionally there for each other. I love her more than you could know. My best friend will be my MOH. She\u2019s also been there for me though things my sister has no idea about. My sister had her best friend as her MOh and I was so proud of them and their relationship and that my sister found friends outside of our sister family relationship. People are allowed to be multidimensional and have more than one meaningful relationship. Just because she\u2019s it for you doesn\u2019t have to mean you\u2019re it for her and that\u2019s okay. They weren\u2019t saying take a step back from the wedding (which shows how\u2019s selfish your thinking) because they were actually implying you take a step back and look at the entire situation. Like take a minute to realize this isn\u2019t all about you. Even your responses are very selfish. Might I ask who\u2019s older?", "Who said anything about half hearted? \nKeep being there for your sister as you were with all your love and support. \nJust don't expect a trophy.", "I was going to so N A H here. Because you are more than entitled to be hurt, you are allowed to have your feelings. But diminishing your sisters love for you because she doesn\u2019t want a a MOH definitely makes YTA.

She isn\u2019t choosing anyone  over you. It sounds like you\u2019re the one willing to trash your relationship over something minor.\n\nThis reminds me of my sister - I had her as my MoH bc I knew she would make my life not be worth living otherwise.\n\nYou say you don\u2019t care if you have the same dress as the others. Really?\n\nIf she had asked you to be moh and then gave you all the same dresses would that be ok? I am kind of doubting that. \n\nThis is her day. Not yours. You can decide what kind of relationship you want with her going forward but getting ridiculous over this is going to push her away. Is that what you want?", "I think you\u2019re reeeeeeeeally over thinking this.\n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal.

I think you've misunderstood whether being MOH is important or not.\n\nYou see being named MOH as some public badge of pride or declaration of how special you are to your sister. She clearly doesn't see it that way. She may see having a MOH as something that will sow discord at her wedding so she chose not to have one. Maybe one of her bridesmaids would want her as MOH for their own wedding and be nurt that she wasn't chosen MOH for your sister. Maybe one of the bridesmaids is really good at wedding planning and would be awesome at the MOH stuff but she knows it would hurt your feelings. Maybe she rolls her eyes at the whole hierarchy completely and loves you all in different ways. Maybe she thinks wedding parties are stupid but her fiance wants some guys up there so she's having women on her side. \n\nYour sister can love you deeply and intensely without having you as MOH. You clearly think MOH is more important than your sister does. Separate the two in your mind. Does she still call and message you a lot? Do you spend time together?

If you're close, then you should be able to sit down and explain why it hurt that she didn't at least have a conversation about it with you 1 on 1.\n\nWalking out of your group chat is just passive-aggressive and will result in her being hurt you did it, and you being hurt that she's upset by your passive-aggressive actions or even more hurt because she didn't notice.

You're pushing hard to be acknowledged as the \"best friend of them all\". \n\nMaybe that's causing her even more anxiety, because now she's afraid of losing your support and love if she doesn't make you MOH.

To you it meant she was your person. Your one person above all others and that is why you are feeling all the feels about being put on a similar role as her friends because to you she is above. \n\nBut perhaps the way she coped with her childhood struggles was to try to branch out as much as possible and have a network of people and its why she doesn't want to have to choose because it would feel to her as she is telling her network that they aren't good enough.
