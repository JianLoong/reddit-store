My sister lives 2 hours away and has seen my daughter once.  The wife, kid, and I made plans to travel the 2 hours to visit my sister.  I thought this would be a good opportunity for my sister to visit with my daughter and we'd go out to eat somewhere.\n\nMy sister has 3 dogs who are her world and have free reign at her place, much to my chagrin at times. They are allowed on the couch, in the kitchen, everywhere. I've visited her and not sat on the couch because I don't want dog hair on me.  We've had family vacations where she brought her dogs.  Everything had to be dog friendly or centric and I did not enjoy that trip.  I've passed on future vacations. There was no point in trying to talk her out of bringing them plus I don't want to spend my vacation with her dogs.\n\nWhen we arrived I knock, hear the barking, and tell my wife to hold off bringing my daughter inside until I know the dogs are in another room.  Sister opens the door, greets me, and says come inside.  I ask do you mind putting the dogs in another room.  She pauses, goes absolutely not, and looks baffled i'd even request that.  I told her that i'm not ready for my daughter to be around 3 dogs. It's only for about an hour then we are going to lunch.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth it's obvious she won't put the dogs away. I just say, alright, i'm going to head home.  I help my wife put my daughter in the car and start to leave.  The whole time my sister is flipping out, saying WTF, she says she didn't even get to see her niece, says I'm an asshole, etc.  So after 5 minutes at my sisters house we drove the 2 hours back home.  I had 2 dozen texts and phone calls from her that I didn't acknowledge.  So was I the asshole in this situation?\n\nEdit: A few things.\n\nThe reason we drove to visit my sister is because she expressed us wanting to come out.  She suggested I come to her place.  \n\nI thought it was no issue to put the dogs in another room for an hour.  Its not like we were staying for days on end, it was a day trip.\n\nI don't want my kid around dogs right now, when she is older and after I can teach her properly how to interact with them she is.  This isn't about allergies.\n\nThe dogs behave fine, but to my knowledge they have never been around babies/children.\n\nMy wife was not happy, but she supports the no dogs around our baby rule.\n\nI'd rather be safe than sorry with our daughter.", "created_utc": 1673802664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cozvx/aita_for_going_home_when_my_sister_didnt_put_her/", "score": 2621, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said that you were only planning to be there a short time so you could have gone somewhere else. \n\nI\u2019m not a dog person and wouldn\u2019t want my baby around multiple dogs that early either, but it is your sister\u2019s home and you knew how she does things before you went. \n\nSo if you didn\u2019t communicate or try to compromise then YTA", "I understand completely your desire to not have the dogs around such a young child, however you shouldn\u2019t have been surprised at her actions given you know how she feels about her pets. You should have discussed this long before arriving.", "\u201cMy sister has 3 dogs who are her world and have free reign at her place, much to my chagrin.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sounds as though your sister considers her dogs to be family. She clearly loves them & treats them well. She wants them to be comfortable in their home. That\u2019s THEIR BUSINESS & THEIR HOME. You are absolutely allowed to not like dogs & not want to be around them. But you DON\u2019T get to dictate what someone does IN THEIR HOME. You knew how things were at your sister\u2019s home before you got in your car & drove the 2 hours to get there so why exactly were you surprised that she refused to \u201cput her dogs away\u201d? I\u2019m genuinely baffled how you don\u2019t see that YOU\u2019RE in the wrong here. I\u2019m curious-have any of these dogs ever bitten or lunged at you or anyone else? Are they Ill-mannered? Poorly behaved? Or is this strictly because you don\u2019t seem to care for dogs (which again, is totally ok). \nP.S.-If it\u2019s not already obvious, yes YTA. You get to do things however you want in YOUR HOME just as your sister gets to in HER HOME.", "YTA \n\nYou for not asking beforehand if she'd mind putting the dogs up while you visit.\n\nInstead of visiting at her house, why not go out to eat with her?\n\nWhy go to someone's house that has 3 dogs if you don't want them around the baby yet?", "YTA. You know about the dogs. You could have communicated your request before showing up. Or you could have just requested that she come to you to see the baby. Or you could have just said you would prefer to go straight to lunch if she wasn\u2019t going to put the dogs away. There were other options and you jumped straight to an ultimatum.", "INFO: are the dogs trained? Have these dogs ever shown aggression? Are they reactive? Do they jump on people to greet them? Have you ever observed the dogs endangering a child? \n\nWhy would dogs not be allowed in the kitchen?", "YTA. You should have asked your sister ahead of time if that would be ok. If the dogs have never been shut in another room while people are home before, it\u2019s not something she can immediately accommodate on a whim. It was also really childish to just pack up and leave instead of suggesting that you go straight to lunch or maybe to a coffee shop if it was too early for lunch. Extra childish for not responding.", "YTA, a huge asshole. You\u2019re at HER home, where her dogs live. I hate to break it to you, but you baby isn\u2019t the center of the universe and being around dogs isn\u2019t going to hurt her. You tried to pull a power move and it backfired.", "Yta. First of all, you should have known she wouldn't be stuffing her dogs in a bedroom. You can't convince her not to take them on vacation, you really thought youd be able to tell her what to do with them in her own home? Second of all, ITS HER HOUSE. You of course have zero say in what she does with her dogs there, despite you obviously think you should, which you shouldnt.

You knew they would be there beforehand, and your condition for entering should have been discussed beforehand so all parties were on board. \n\nEven bigger asshole for making your wife get ready only to turn around and go back home.\n\nNext time extend the invitation to your sister to visit without the dogs. If she chooses to find a pet sitter and visit, it\u2019s a win win situation.", "YTA\n\n>She pauses, goes absolutely not, and looks baffled i'd even request that. \n\nClearly you made plans to be in her home for an hour without giving her a heads up that you would want her to confine the dogs during your visit. You had no reason to expect her to agree to that. You asking it made no sense to her.\n\nYou should have either arranged a visit entirely in a neutral location or, when scheduling the visit, clearly requested that she be ready to confine the dogs in another room. Instead, you sprang it on her as a surprise. Perhaps you thought she might agree if you surprised her. More likely, you wanted an excuse to try to blame her for the situation you created.", "YTA. You knew she had the dogs in her house and that the dogs are her family. Why didn\u2019t you just say that you didn\u2019t want your daughter around them and go right to lunch instead? This seems like it was intentional on your part, to \u2018punish\u2019 her for having the dogs- something you ALREADY knew. This was a set up that she was going to fail. You wanted to control the situation and when she said no you punished her by leaving.", "YTA for not discussing it beforehand since you know how she is with her dogs. If she said absolutely not at that time then you could have saved yourself 4 hours worth of driving.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re one for not wanting your newborn near 3 dogs. You should have encouraged her to come to you.", "YTA. You know your sister has dogs and yet you expect her to change things around because you have a 3 month old. Not because of allergies or the dogs aren\u2019t well behaved. If the dogs bothered you so much you should have met at a restaurant or mutual place.\n\nSecondly, YTA for making your poor wife ride back 4 hours RT for nothing. 3 month postpartum, drove 2 hours, gets out of the car for probably 10 minutes for you to have a verbal spat with your sister, then has to get back in the car for another 2 hour long car ride.", "Yta", "YTA. Why would you just assume she'd put the dogs away in her own home? And why is it bad for dogs to be around a child? It actually helps their immune system and overall health.", "YTA \n\nEntitled new parent? Check\n\nDog hating weirdo? Check\n\nGives people orders in their own home as a guest? Check\n\nPunishes everyone when they don\u2019t get their way? Check\n\nHonestly I\u2019d trust a dog with OP\u2019s infant over OP.", "YTA for the way you handled this. You haven\u2019t outright said it to your sister, but you expect her to choose your child over her dogs, and you wanted to set rules at her house. You can have boundaries about dogs beings around the baby, but you don\u2019t get to impose them in your sister\u2019s house. You set your sister up to fail your loyalty test, and used your kid to do it. Not cool.", "Going on vacation and she brings her dogs expecting everyone else to conform, she's the asshole. You going to her house (the dog's house) and expecting them to conform to your expectations, you are the asshole. You should have asked questions before you drove 2 hrs.", "Well. It's quite clear from your post that you're setting up the whole dogs story in a negative context. You even have your opinion on how your sister should manage her dogs. I think it's totally your own fear and incompetence to deal with the dogs your sister probably sees as equal to her children. Would you mind someone asking you to put YOUR children in another room when they visit YOUR house? It's your choice to meet at her home where you know the dogs will be. Also you know that the dogs are an equal part of the family, as you described, there's no place off limits for the dogs. You know this. But still you choose to visit her and demand her to take actions to facilitate you in her own house. You the asshole here. \n\nPs. Projecting your own hate or fear for dogs on your 3 months old will result in a child that will grown up with fear and possibly hate for dogs. Children have only one emotional disposition towards pet animals and that is love. Learn from it. Do better.", "ESH\n\nI\u2019m kind of baffled that it didn\u2019t occur to you, based on prior experiences and knowing that the dogs have free rein, to discuss the dogs before you agreed to go visit. \n\nYou clearly don\u2019t like dogs period. That\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s AH to assume that she\u2019s going to put the dogs away in her home just because you don\u2019t like dogs. \n\nOn the flip side, it wouldn\u2019t harm the dogs to be contained and your sister is an AH for not making the accommodation for a short visit.", "YTA, unless her dogs are dangerous or something? Most dogs adore children. It sounds like this is your issue, not a saftey issue, and that is strange....   \nI have 3 kids and dogs and there has never been an injury at my place. Dog hair? Yes. Lint rollers? Also yes.  \nWeird of you, man. YTA", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou had plenty of knowledge about your sister and her dogs.  Why in the world would you go to her house without explicitly telling her in advance that you would want the dogs kept from your child?\n\nYour sister should have been more accommodating, sure.  Or all of you could have just left for the restaurant immediately, why didn't anyone suggest that?\n\nWhat a ridiculous way for adults to interact on a simple issue.", "INFO: why don\u2019t you want dogs around your daughter?", "YTA  \nDo you pay for your sister's house? Do you live there? Do you do her chores?   \nThen why on earth would you think you get to dictate anything that goes on under her roof? If you're so put out about how she runs her household, don't visit.  You are so determined to be the martyr here - 'drove 2 hours back home', 'much to my chagrin', 'I didn't enjoy the trip' etc. You could have chosen to meet  elsewhere - it even seems like you knew how this would play out, and yet still went over there.

I feel like both your views are extreme here. Any time you are going to come to someone\u2019s home on the condition that you set the rules there you are breaking etiquette. This should be talked about beforehand. On the other hand the idea that your dogs won\u2019t be welcome around a newborn should be a surprise to no dog owner and it\u2019s rude of her to not put them away.

You could have been more clear about your expectations with your infant daughter, and rather than just left in an entitled huff, said, let\u2019s just go to the restaurant early. Also, as a dog owner, I generally crate my dogs when new people/tiny kids come over until everyone has the opportunity to get acquainted, and the dogs have been able to calm down from the excitement of a person coming over. It really doesn\u2019t bother me and I think it\u2019s part of being an accommodating host. That said, the dogs live there, not you.", "ESH. You could have skipped the visiting in her home and just gone out to eat, but mostly, if you were uncomfortable with the dogs, you should have let her know in advance.", "When people puts their children above everything/ everyone, they are entitled. When they do the same with their dogs, they are right. I\u2019ll never get that. It\u2019s common sense to not have THREE dogs around a newborn. You don\u2019t know how they react. The sister should have used logic if she wanted to see her niece, even at her own home.

Maybe it was and you just didn't mention it but I feel more info is needed. Not going into the house was reasonable but just immediately driving home? Why didn't you and your wife go for lunch?", "YTA, you didn't ask before showing up if she would be willing to put the dogs in another room, and you had plenty of time to talk about it like an adult. The simple solution would have been to just go eat. Instead, you threw a fit and left because you got pissed off, and you didn't get your way.", "NTA at all, I used to be a dog person but I can\u2019t claim that anymore because they are so rude and selfish.  It\u2019s obviously not safe to have a newborn baby around three (questionably under control?) dogs.\n\nAnd the same crazy dog people love to post on social media that it is the dogs home so if you don\u2019t like sitting in dog hair or the dog jumping on you then you need to leave\n\n* edit* someone made a good point below, if this was predictable behavior on her part you should have planned better and discussed it ahead of time and if she was unwilling then just met somewhere for lunch in the middle", "Soft YTA, but only because you didn't talk about it beforehand.  There were so many ways to handle this situation better but I do understand why you wanted the dogs put up.\n\nI have 3 dogs, I love my dogs.  I know not everyone in my family does.  I'd never dream to take them on a family trip and those family members don't come over much.  When they do, my dogs are put outside with their toys.

It\u2019s the dogs\u2019 home. \n\nWould you be offended if she came to your house in a few years and demanded you lock your daughter in another room while she was there with her dogs because little kids can hurt dogs without meaning to? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019d let her dogs come to your house anyway, but as a hypothetical it\u2019s very congruous. Toddlers can be super harmful to dogs without meaning to, just as dogs can be harmful to kids without meaning to.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that would be an insane and rude request in your eyes. She clearly considers her dogs her family, and she likely saw your request the same way.\n\nNot to mention that the request was already pretty entitled, and something a mature adult would have discussed ahead of time. \n\nYou also could have planned to meet her at the restaurant and spent the other time at a park or something, rather than going to her house where you knew her dogs would be and expecting her to \u201cput them away\u201d like objects and not the living things they are. And again, the dogs *live there*. *You* are a *guest*. \n\nIf it were me I would have asked you to leave when you asked that.

It\u2019s her home but to accommodate you for an hour isn\u2019t a hard request. Maybe next time she wants to see her niece, maybe see if she can come to your home where the dogs are not welcome. Those two are the only compromises I can see happening. I\u2019d be the same way honestly. I don\u2019t like dog hair (even from my own dog) on me. And I wouldn\u2019t want them in my face.

When her hands are full of a damn baby. I love my dog. He is my world. But he would already be in the other room if someone brought a newborn over. Come on, now.

I told her that i'm not ready for my daughter to be around 3 dogs. It's only for about an hour then we are going to lunch. \n\nAfter a bit of back and forth it's obvious she won't put the dogs away. I just say, alright, i'm going to head home.  I help my wife put my daughter in the car and start to leave.

If I invite someone over (assuming they are aware I have cats), it is reasonable to assume that they are okay with cats. I can't complete de-cat everything. Putting them in one room is possible for them, thankfully, but the hair is still everywhere, no matter how hard I clean. If that's a problem or they have an allergy, they need to tell me we have to meet somewhere else. \n\nShe didn't respond the best she could have, but she was put on the spot and likely didn't have an option if it meant them coming in.

He never argued or fought against any of us for wanting/ getting a pet. They would eventually grow on him and he\u2019d open up to them, now in his older age he appreciates them (he only does basic care now, before he would have no hand in caring for them). I have also known people who want a pet; but they are incapable of caring properly, do not the money/ space, not have the time to give the pet their proper needs, etc. \n\n(I do not want to start a debate, I just want to provide insight. I want people to accept others! <3) \n\nI got attacked by several different breeds of dogs in my childhood, I\u2019m not a big fan of dogs; especially big dogs. I\u2019ve had people be accommodating just by saying I have issues around big dogs: they make sure I feel safe and secure by having them outside or having a baby gate up/ close a door to keep them out of where I was at. I get introduced at the pace and space that makes me more comfortable. I\u2019m also more allergic to dogs than I am to other animals. \n\nI say ESH. OP acting entitled without communication to sister about how he wants to introduce his newborn to animals; Sister should be aware of everyone\u2019s feelings towards animals/ her dogs as a responsible dog owner (which doesn\u2019t sound like the case). Y\u2019all should have just gone out to lunch instead of going inside. Could have gone elsewhere to hang out as well. \n\nWife and baby should not have been placed in that situation! \n\nAnd before people defend the sister to me: being a responsible pet/ dog owner is knowing the feelings of family and friends towards their own dogs. She brings them everywhere and expects everything to be centered around them; that\u2019s selfish af. Also, seems like OP has been vocal about his feelings towards them, it\u2019s not hard to accommodate in having the dogs be in another part of the house. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why people are saying it\u2019s cruel or unreasonable to do that to a dog. Why is it okay for sister to bring them on a family vacation and then expect the vacation to be completely accommodating to her dogs when that wasn\u2019t the plan at the start?

From the baby not having a fully developed immune system yet, to the possibility of little accidents like the wait staff tripping on the high chair and spilling hot water on the baby (ok, that one is quite a stretch, I admit it, but it technically*could* happen) - being out in a public space with lots of people close at hand isn't necessarily a better option than being in a room with three dogs. \n\nOf course, the OP in this case (and his wife) seem like good parents trying to do what's best for their new baby, and it sounds like they were comfortable with the restaurant scenario.  The opinion of some rando armchair parent on Reddit who has an infinitesimally small amount of information about these people should be worth absolutely nothing.  But I'll give it anyway, and agree - they should have talked to sister first, determined where the dogs were or were not going to be, and taken it from there, *before* they left home. Or, if OP is correct in the edit that the sister asked them to come to her house, that would have been a good time to say something like \"We're not ready for {baby} to be with any pets yet.  Why don't you come here?\"", "Exactly. Mine are crate trained and it does make guests easier. My dog loving guests I \"use\" to help with training and reinforce training with their permission.(Manners, no jumping, no rushing doors). Otherwise, they cam hamg out in crates.

I thought it was a 1 off...then I had my son amd she started doing the same when he started walking. In both cases the babies were not close to the dog, just in the same room. We could not train that behavior out of her and a family member without small kids took her. So yeah. A parent says they are uncomfortable, I am on it.

He was having to make serious compromises to introduce his sister to her niece and she can\u2019t even show the absolute lowest amount of consideration towards him. People on Reddit thinking that putting your dogs in another room counts as a \u201ccompromise\u201d is honestly mind blowing", "So OP should also not have his baby around strange fathers he doesn\u2019t like?? Tf does what you said have anything to do with the topic?", "This is what it really boils down to. You knew the dog situation and should have discussed before making the trip. This could have been avoided if you asked. You assumed you could walk in and demand she put the dogs away and she would acquiesce. She did not. You could have also asked to go to lunch then and if it was too early offered to meet at the place in an hour.", "ASKING pet owners for accommodations is perfectly fine, and what you're getting at. Now, with this guy, I'm not sure there are any accommodations that would work for him. Even if the dogs were \"put away,\" whole house vacuumed, and more, he'd probably find some dog-related thing to complain about, but many people can do with small accommodations.\n\nI'm quite allergic to cats (I actually had an allergy panel recently to deal with a food allergy, and it confirmed that my most severe allergy is cat dander), and if I stay with someone who has cats all I request is that the room I sleep in won't be invaded by the cats (a door that closes works), clean sheets are available (I'm happy to do the washing and/or make the bed myself), and a normal vacuuming has happened in the room (again, happy to do it myself, just tell me where the vacuum is!). Otherwise, I know you have cats and I should be prepared to take allergy meds while I'm visiting you. \n\nThe first time my BF spent the night, he asked if the dog would be joining us in bed (he knows dog normally sleeps in bed with me). He's not allergic, but was a bit put off about the thought of a dog...getting in the way, if you know what I mean. \"He won't come upstairs to bed unless I invite him.\" When we headed to bed, I told my dog to go lay down, which means get into his bed (a REALLY nice dog bed!) on the main floor. Dog stayed there all night (I mean he probably got up to get a drink here and there, but was passed out in his bed when we got up the next morning). He was surprised when that worked! \"I did train him that coming into my bedroom and bed was by invitation only! He'll probably sleep on the floor if you're okay with him coming into the bedroom in the future\" (I got him (dog, of course) another bed for the bedroom and he now sleeps off the bed but in the bedroom when BF is here, and we're all happy). He was equally surprised when my dog didn't enter the kitchen the first time I cooked for him. \"Oh, yeah, the kitchen is off-limits! It's dangerous (ed: my kitchen is not very big, so I could easily trip over him with a knife or pot of something hot in my hands), so I trained him to stay out so I don't stab or boil him!\" My dog *does* live here, but he has boundaries to keep him safe and everyone comfortable. I took the first couple times I stayed at BF's to enforce the same rules there, and he is a champ with them! New house, same rules, he totally understood!", "I'd generally agree, but it seems like there was _done _ discussion about this beforehand ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cozvx/aita_for_going_home_when_my_sister_didnt_put_her/j4gy61b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)). It shouldn't have been a surprise at all\n\nEdit: oof, the more of OPs comments I read the rougher it gets. I'm not so sure anymore that they were clear about this or handled it well", "And the way it reads is that he didn't communicate so he could catch sister out and cause a fuss, he seems to hate that his sister loves her dogs so much.", "It's always the absolute shittiest dog owners with the worst trained dogs that act like that. \n\nAlso, what the hell do you mean \"I made a comment to the owner\" I would be fucking pissed and my friend would be apologizing while leaving with his dog if that shit happened. How do you have these unreasonable people around you so often?", "You clearly have a lot of anger my dude, hypertension kills, take a breath", "It\u2019s super nice but you know your people and if they mind! I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t! And it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re being obtuse about your dogs being up in a newborns space! \ud83d\udc9c", "This thread has taught me that the only question you need to ask to find out if someone is a good or bad dog owner is if they're able to leave their dog in another room. Reading comments above were horrifying seeing 2 dog owners agree with each other that it's impossible to put their dogs in another room with people in the house because they'll bark and want to be around the people. These people don't put any effort into training their dogs.", "Sigh\u2026 If infant safety is the be all end all, then by the logic of you seeing news stories about dogs mauling babies, OP shouldn\u2019t be allowed around his own kid since parents are far more likely to harm them and be in the news for it. Because \u201cI saw some stories, so\u2026\u201d is a bad argument. \n\nEnd of day, OP knew the dogs lived there and gave no indication of his comfortability about them being around his kid until he showed up and expected the dogs to be locked in a room for an hour or more. When he didn\u2019t get his way he threw a tantrum and left. You know what else is more dangerous to infants than dogs? Traveling in a vehicle on an American (maybe Canadian) highway. OP put his kid and new mom on the road for 4hrs for no reason because he threw a snit. It\u2019s bonkers anyone thinks \u201cnot giving into unreasonable last minute demands\u201d is AH territory but here we are.", "Yeah I get not liking dogs, not everyone does and that\u2019s ok. But it\u2019s quite petty to make a point of that at the expense of a newborn and a new mom.", "This!  Also, I think the baby is an excuse to pick a fight with his sister over her dogs. He seems to have never approved.", "Yeah all those kids that live in antibiotic bubbles are the ones that get sick all the time! My kids played in the dirt and were exposed to every germ known to man practically because their soldier father worked in the emergency room at the base hospital. I'm a teacher and most of my career was spent in elementary school. I have been sick once in 25 years. I've never had a flu shot while all the other teachers around me have been dropping like flies regularly every single year with one illness or another.", "Yea my little cousins have been super young when meeting our dogs like 4-5 years old and every time we introduce them, I've had both my hands firmly on the dog (petting them and keeping them relaxed but also) ready to pin them down if they react negatively because you really just never know. Even for my sister's dog I did the same thing even though that dog has been super shy and quiet it's whole life. It's the dog owner's responsibility to do that and go above and beyond to prevent any accidents because if it happens then your dog is likely going to be put down and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.", "100% agree, this was bigger than this one event with the dogs. What a weirdo, yta.", "I agree. It sounds like he didn't have good footing to start a fight about it, and now that he has a baby he's \"weaponizing\" and purposefully misunderstanding the interaction and not communicating....so that he and his sister will have a tiff. Then, at the next family event he can say \" my child is more important than a dog!\" when really he is the one who had a problem all along with the dogs. lol", "Scientists have studied it - and it's true.", "How do you mean choose a dog?\n\nI'm childfree. I would rather have a dog than a kid any day of the week. But it doesn't mean I want to see kids get injured.", "Hardly, if the baby is loud then they'll just leave the room to get away from the noise.  They shouldn't be left alone with a baby, but they are no risk at all unless there is something really wrong with them while their owner is there.", "Anyone that knows dogs understands they are even more protective of an infant than a human.\nThey might be curious at first but they would defend that baby particularly because they can smell the genetic link to their mistress.", "Oh that\u2019s smart", "Exactly. There are dogs I didn't want to bring my baby around. I just didn't visit those houses. He's looking for an argument.", "Mom of 3 here. Have heard not to let baby sleep in the car seat outside of the car. Never heard to make sure you take baby out for a bit every two hours on a road trip. Makes planning my family\u2019s upcoming vacation more interesting since we will have an 8 month old by then. Thank you for sharing", "Hell, I never realized how much of a mess my kids made until our dog passed away and he wasn\u2019t there to clean up the crumbs we didn\u2019t know existed. Dogs are great housekeeping help!", "I know because my baby was a 1pd 14 oz NICU baby. They have to pass tests before going home and 2 are carseat tests. But y'all, they told us this and I knew so many people that did it, I honestly never thought about how long a baby was safe in a PUMPKIN SEAT \ud83d\udcba THAT WAS SCARY!!!!! I mean they should be telling you this beforehand ... And 99 percent of people are never told !"]}
