So I put my name down and sent it off. He tried to bribe me to change it over the years (saying he\u2019ll actually pay child support if I change his surname) but I never agreed.

Great.\n\nIf not, you are far more statistically likely to be raised by your mother in the event of a separation, and having a different surname to your child makes life complicated. You have to constantly prove you're related, in hospitals, on flights, at school. It's irritating and time consuming.\n\nYou're a single mother. You're clearly going to be doing all the work of raising your child. Why should you let this deadbeat who can't even be bothered to stay awake and hold his child have his name involved?", "NTA.

No way was I carrying a child for 9 months, potentially wrecking my body and then them not have my name. We ended up merging our names.\n\nAnd that\u2019s my husband I\u2019m planning to spend my life with, who is an excellent dad.

Moreover my kid is mixed European and African and unfortunately there's a lot of discrimination on the job and housing market if you have an African name. \n\nI decided to give her both our last names. Her dad was very displeased with me, but I have zero regrets. \n\nHe was horrible to me during and after the pregnancy, but he's still her father, and although he hardly pays for anything and only sees her every other weekend he's a good dad to her, so I'm happy she has his name too. \n\nI think more countries should have the possibility for two names, the father's name only system is extremely outdated and patriarchal and doesn't reflect modern society with so many single mothers and mothers as equal or primary breadwinners and child rearers.", "You're a bad mother for leaving the baby alone he said.

She is your priority. He needs to support her or go away. \n\nDon\u2019t give his last name. The reality is that she is your daughter. You\u2019ve stood up and been a mother. He just wants the child to have his last name for some patriarchal nonsense. Giving her his last name won\u2019t feed her, clothe her, comfort her when she\u2019s crying; it won\u2019t pick her up, pay attention to her, kiss her boo boos as she ages; it won\u2019t potty train, remember her first words/steps; it won\u2019t love her. \n\nDon\u2019t pay attention to him or his family. \n\nYea, his father was kind, but they didn\u2019t force him to show up or care; they still aren\u2019t doing that. He accused you of an eating disorder and made fun of your body. He is her bio dad, but if you went to a sperm bank, the person you chose would be equally the father without making you feel bad. They would do exactly the same amount of daddying as he\u2019s done. You would give her their last name, he doesn\u2019t get it either. The man that is there for his child gets that honor. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s another way to look at it. You don\u2019t give the child his name just because two people are married, because mom takes husbands name. If they aren\u2019t married, mom can choose her maiden name. The reality is that babies are *always* named after mom, he just fails to see that. \n\nCongratulations on new baby!\n\nETA: I\u2019ve known some deadbeats. They *always* want the child to have their name but to not do anything else. It\u2019s a possessive mentality. She\u2019s MY daughter, he\u2019s MY son! But\u2026 that\u2019s it.
