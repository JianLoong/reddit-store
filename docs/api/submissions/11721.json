My aunt got married in a dress, then my Mom got married in it, and it went to sit in a closet.   When I got married I wore the dress, then I believe my cousin did too.  I understand her feelings on the situation but it isn\u2019t her dress it was your Moms.  Just like it wasn\u2019t My Moms it was my aunts and we promptly returned it.   \n\nIf your comfortable with it when your cousin is of age you can gage her interest in wearing it and maybe loan it to her.

Don't tell your aunt about anything else of your mom's you have and don't give up the dress.", "Hmmm I am conflicted. So I will not pass a judgement yet. But, the aunt also wore it for her wedding. The aunt also has sentimental ties to this dress. It could be argued (I will not be, but it can) that the aunt has more ties with the dress than you.\n\nHow she went around asking for it is rude. As well as asking for more things. \n\nThe aunt obviously doesn\u2019t need it. But I think it should be considered the family wedding dress. She has some right to the dress. She has pictures of her wearing it. The actual owner is not here to collect it back. \n\nThe dress should be worn and not just put into storage or put up somewhere out of sight. If you intend to do that, let the aunt have it. If you honestly( and I mean truly. Give it a good look. You need to be set on this) think you will wear it at your wedding without changing it drastically, keep it. Keep the memory going. \n\nJust don\u2019t keep it out of spite. I hope you do keep it and plan to use it!", "INFO - if your aunt\u2019s daughter wanted to wear the dress one day, would that be ok with you?", "I absolutely would let me cousin wear it if she wants to when the time comes. I feel the same way, I wish she had a little more sensitivity for how I might feel about it the same way that I do for her.", "I agree. I think in her mind the original owner is gone so the only other person who wore it as a wedding dress was her, so it should be hers. She just wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else but herself as usual :(", "She wore it to her own wedding 20+ years ago, she wanted to keep it for her daughter", "I definitely have compassion for her reaction, she wore it to her wedding too so I think I\u2019m her mind it\u2019s her wedding dress too, but it\u2019s not. I didn\u2019t say anything and let it go. She just has a pattern of doing/saying other things that are rude that I haven\u2019t discussed her and it weighs on me", "I agree it definitely has sentimental value for her so I sympathize with her for that reason. It\u2019s just that it was my moms and I don\u2019t have anything of hers and I absolutely adore the pictures of her in her wedding dress, and I want to keep it because it is sentimental to me. \n\nI\u2019m confused about your second point because she\u2019s not going to put it on display, she would put it in the back of her closet like it\u2019s in the back of mine now for her daughter to maybe or maybe not wear it someday, just like I may or may not wear it. I would definitely like to keep it in my family and I have no issue with my cousin (or anyone in my family) wearing it one day if she wants to.", "Yes", "Sorry I meant her daughter. I don't see a problem with her wanting to borrow the dress if and when her daughter gets married in the future; it clearly has an emotional attachment in your family which is nice, but if she wants to keep it herself even though it was left to you, then you're NTA and she is.", "Would I be right in thinking that her wedding was after your parents, but before your mom passed, and that after her wedding she gave it back to your mom?\n\nIf so, absolutely NTA. She clearly understood it was your mom's dress then. Your mom passing doesn't change that.", "I felt that if you say it\u2019s sentimental and you were set on keeping it that you should put it to some use. Make a mural for you mom or pay to have it preserved. They can box it up nice and pretty for you to have put for people to see. \n\nIf it\u2019s going to be put up on either side of the family, just keep it and let them borrow it like your mother did. I figured maybe the aunt would display it. \n\nThe dress isn\u2019t the important part; it\u2019s the memories. \n\nOh! If you can fit it, maybe take some pictures! Or let the aunt take some pictures in it!\nOr, if there was a veil and the aunt wore it, let her have that part.\n\nIf you plan on keeping until you get married, it needs to be preserved. Helps it to stay white, smell nice, and not get mold or moths or anything.", "NTA. Let your aunt know that although the dress will be in your possession, you would be more than happy to loan it to her daughter if she wants to wear it. I could see her objection if you weren\u2019t willing to share but since you are, it shouldn\u2019t matter to her if the dress stays with you.", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly how it was. My aunt never had the dress in her possession besides for her wedding."]}
