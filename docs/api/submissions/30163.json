It's understandable that you want equal effort and support in the relationship, especially when you've shown so much care and support during your unemployment.

Yes doing things in general is very difficult, I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve neglected my hygiene and left a mess around the house, etc. But you don\u2019t get stupid, you know that you should do those things and there is no reason to snap at your partner or to just not take your medication.

So I don't think alot of replies understand this and how deep that rabit hole goes but I digress. \n\n\nHowever your not a maid, or his cleaner or his mom. First thing he needs to do is start taking his medication again, that will make it easier for the next part. Then he sets an alarm gets up and does proactive things every day. Looking for work, cleaning the house, making the dinner. His reward will be things he like like a couple hours of games or movies with you whatever it is. \n\n\nEssentially things are not going to get get better and land in his lap. He needs to be proactive and make steps to get better. I'm not saying it's easy but it's doable. Because what's the alternative, you leaving him and him fading into non existence.

My boyfriend take most of the bills up because of that (so i\u2019m in a similar spot to your boyfriend). Even tho i\u2019m depressed i still try to take care of him and the house (we have roommates so it gets messy fast). While i don\u2019t clean up or shower everyday i try to do ljttle things for him everyday to see him smile.  Also why was he irritated with you when you went to sleep after a long day?? He sounds like an asshole, depression or not. Also if he has meds he should be taking them because they help. Depression seems to be the excuse for his behavior and doesn\u2019t really want to change. If he wasn\u2019t okay with being depressed he\u2019d be taking even baby steps to help himself and you. You should talk with him and express that he needs to take care of himself and try to help with even one simple thing a day; like unloading the dishwasher or cleaning the counter.

I\u2019ve been there, where you don\u2019t even have the motivation to bathe. Maybe you could help your SO by looking at listings for them and telling them the numbers to call.

And OP is not opposed to having it as a placeholder ring or upgrading the ring along with their lives. Some people spend tens of thousands of dollars on rings. If she buys a $50 ring every year for 50 years she will have spent $2500. And technically she could get a $2500 ring that might last 50 years if not lost, but then you don\u2019t get the fun experience of getting a new ring every year and having the style grow with you and having a cute keepsake for every year of their marriage. In fact the more I think about it the more I kinda wish I had done that instead of a more expensive ring.\n\n\n\nNot everyone has your values. Not everyone sees a cheap ring as a red flag and I do honestly think it\u2019s shitty of you to say.", "My mom is the one who pushed him to buy the cheap ring.

I gave a $6000 ring, she didn't like it because it was my grandma's and it was dated, so that's in the safe. So I got a lab made diamond ring for $1500 for her. But if I bought her a $35 ring and she said I was too cheap, then the problem wouldn't be on me, it would be on her for being too materialistic. For us, it was about how the ring felt and looked, not the value of it. \n\nWomen who shame men for buying cheaper rings are honestly just revealing their entitlement. \n\nIt can go both ways: \n\nIf your family can't pay the dowry to the groom, you're cheap. In some places the women's family is expected to pay a lot towards this and if you show up empty handed you'd be turned away for being too low class.\n\nI'm an American and we don't request dowries here, but the attitude you have is outdated. Misogyny is gone! Everyone is equal now. Women can pay for rings and propose, no problem. Too cheap? Buy another one!

Many offer this, and some jobs are required to have it, especially federal projects and private-public projects. \n\nBonus, if he gets into a federal project, like a highway for example, they usually have minimum wages that are agreed upon before the job begins with a contract. Here\u2019s some info on the Davis-Bacon Act:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis\u2013Bacon_Act_of_1931\n\nAnother option is to find staffing agencies in your area. He says what jobs he\u2019s willing to do and the company will place him. The time he\u2019ll be on a job varies, but after the job is done, the staffing agency will place him at a new one. This is a quick way to learn a lot of different skills and fatten the resume.\n\n\nEdit: I know everyone in this thread is talking about how he\u2019s not trying and he\u2019s disrespecting you. I get it, they\u2019re right. But I\u2019ve also been in his shoes. I know you\u2019re coming home after a long day of work and he\u2019s essentially doing nothing. That\u2019s all face value. You have to ask yourself if you\u2019re trying to work this out or do what everyone else does and just kick him to the curb when things get tough. Two months of no work is definitely not a good sign, but when you\u2019re in the position he\u2019s in, the days just start blending together and the time passes quickly. If he\u2019s anything like me, all I really needed was for my SO to be positive and correct my negative thinking with optimistic, yet realistic suggestions and nudges in the right direction. Obviously it\u2019s not sustainable for him to work on the GED right now with no job, so once you get the talk out of the way where you and him agree that he needs to get a job going now, you\u2019ll be able to help him with getting the contacts together for electrical companies and/or staffing agencies in the area that will likely solve all of this in no time.\n\nThe reason I say all of this is because I\u2019ve had resentment in my relationship about this very topic. I\u2019ve always thought back and asked myself \u201cif I lost this job, is my SO going to be there for me, or be another roadblock for my mental health when I need it the most?\u201d", "Okay, get an acetone-free nail polish remover. Works wonders on the green marks & won\u2019t dry out your skin too much", "Don't sweat it, half the kids here have never had a meaningful relationship and tell OPs to immediately leave, divorce, etc. Reddits advice is pretty terrible for relationships in general because of this. Unfortunately there are just too many 14-18 year olds that base their knowledge on memes, movies, etc. \n\nNTA op\n\nIf you look at cutekio's profile, she admits to never having had sex before, tells people to immediately break up with their boyfriend, gives medical advice that she says she learned in middle school biology, and is exactly what I am talking about.\n\nLiterally, I didn't even check cutekios post history -\nBefore I wrote this post lol... editing my post now to mention it. Reddit really is highschoolers giving adults life advice behind anonymous usernames.", "I knew someone was gonna say something. Let me go ahead and explain. \n\nWe both mutually don't care if one of us works, I've agreed to be a stay at home wife one day, and he said he didn't care if he works (he seems happier working. He wanted to get his ged but he was discouraged after failing his practice tests) I also like working, and I have family who can hook me up on at-home jobs, and either way I'd still work part time or not. But as of recently he has been stressed and I felt bad and I've said if we ever had kids and I liked the job my relative was getting me into I could just full time that and he could be a stay at home dad / husband and he said he would do that too, he just wants me to be happy. Its not any preference, he just wants to take care of me are his words whether it's supporting me financially or taking care of my needs. But that's kind of where my post came in. As mentioned I know he is depressed but he has been very lazy and depressed and we haven't been financially okay the past month since I wasn't working the weeks I was gone on vacation. Once I'm back 40 hours a week and bringing in a livable income he might ease up, but he feels useless and depressed and he isn't really doing much because he says he just feels like a failure all the way around. I'm sorry if it came out very confusion, I've been awake him 5:30 am and I'm very exhausted", "Ok I understand what you mean now. He wants to work but can\u2019t. And says he would take care of you as a stay at home husband but can\u2019t/won\u2019t actually do that in practice.\n\n\n\nMy sister kinda had this happen, although with kids which compounds the stress. She went on maternity leave and even though she was still bringing in income in her case, she started doing everything. Big home cooked meals when he came home catered to his preferences. Kids taken care of. Sent him with lunch for work, tried to pick him up special things when she went to the store, the whole works. And then when he was unemployed he was depressed about it. Which means she came home to a mess and dirty dishes. She still cooked dinner unless she reminded him to put something in the air fryer. She bought her own lunch at work at he spent his days playing video games. Being depressed also made him lash out more and get defensive and angry sometimes.\n\n\nI wish I could say she talked to him and he got better, or even maybe that she said fuck him and left. But honestly in her case she just did everything for a while. She took on more financial responsibility, still did as much of not more chores because he was home all the time adding to the mess, and took care of the kids. She also made his resume, looks on indeed for him, applies to jobs for him, fills out paperwork for him, sends emails, and does all but attend the interview herself. Eventually she found him a job and things immediately got better. But she got him the job.\n\n\n\n\nDepression sucks. I won\u2019t tell you to leave if you love him and wish to stay, but do know that the likely path involves you putting in a lot of work that feels very overwhelming and unappreciated. In the end it worked out for my sister but she can\u2019t say there isn\u2019t some lingering resentment and fear over how he handles rough situations in life.", "Maybe have a firm, but gentle tlan revisiting what would make you happy- him stepping up to support you from the home while you work right now. Let him know that you need your partner back. Let him know that you see him right now, and you are here for him. Let him know he can take a step and move forward with you. He can do better, and when he fails, he can pick himself up and YOU move forward TOGETHER to make it through it. Talk about how he can set goals to reach supporting you the way you need. Hea feeling helpless and needs to know he can do something about it still. It isn't helpless like he feels. He isn't hopeless."]}
