He got hammered and blacked out because he was taking advantage of the open bar. There was a couple sitting next to us at the assigned table, and the woman was equally as hammered. The two spent the night giggling and whispering in each other\u2019s ears (they had never met before, we don\u2019t even remember her name) and at one point my husband\u2019s face was dangerously close to her cleavage. All while I was sitting right next to them, btw (also my cleavage looked fabulous that day so um hello, maybe look at your wife)\n\nAnyway, I kept begging him to leave and go back to the hotel room, others came up to me like \u201clol your husband is druuuunk dude check him\u201d and it was extremely embarrassing. He kept refusing. Eventually I poured him into an Uber and spent the entire night taking care of him while he threw up. The next day, I drove us home while he kept throwing up into a bag in the car. He remembers none of the events from that night. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was *cheating* per se, but it was crossing a physical boundary. I didn\u2019t plan to bring it up, given how drunk he was, but he snapped at me over something innocuous (I thought he turned off subtitles on the tv when he hadn\u2019t) and I just boiled over like \u201cYEAH WELL I DIDNT DO WHAT YOU DID\u201d\n\nThen the whole thing came out, and I had pics but he didn\u2019t want to see them and insisted I delete them (now I wish I hadn\u2019t). He was extremely apologetic, said he had to rethink everything he thought about himself, swore off drinking, etc. I said fine, but it\u2019s going to take me time to reconcile myself to it, even if I know it was because you were revoltingly drunk. (Note- he does not get hammered like that regularly, it\u2019s extremely rare and I\u2019ve never seen it to that extent in the 4 years I\u2019ve known him)\n\nI talked about it to my therapist, which I told him beforehand I would, but I might have fucked up today because I went on the balcony and told my mom about it, but he overheard because I misjudged my volume. I just needed to vent to my mom, but I see how it seems like a betrayal to him. My mom is not an interfering crazy MIL, she in fact told me to make my peace with it since that\u2019s what I said I\u2019d do, but he\u2019ll be worried that she sees him in a different light now. \n\nMy opinion is, if there was no incident, then there wouldn\u2019t be an incident for me to talk about, would there? \n\nBut I think this is the kind of thing maybe I should have kept quiet from my family, if I truly was planning to move on from it. It\u2019s hard to keep quiet about something that you haven\u2019t moved past, even if the plan is to move past it in the future.

The whole wedding saw him!!! So the time for discretion is gone.

I think OP you have the right to discuss it with your support system. \n\nI\u2019m curious though, what steps has he taken to make this up to you and fix it?", "NTA \n\nYour husband expects you to police YOUR behavior when he couldn't even police his own? Fuck that. If he wants to feel less ashamed, he can publicly apologize to you in front of all the friends that witnessed his behavior...\n\nETA: You can probably recover the photos.", "NTA. If any of your other family members attended that wedding, you may have to spell it out to him that *everyone who was there* already sees him in a different light. The way to fix that is to apologize to the bride, groom, and everybody who had to wrangle his drunk ass, and then be a sober designated driver for the next several family events. Just never speaking of it again won't cut it.", "You have every right to talk about something that upsets you with the ppl you care about. NTA", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to talk to your mom.! Lord knows I tell my mom almost everything (some things she doesn't know bc it's between my partner and I). Don't let him make you feel like you can't or shouldn't.

In your case was your mom. If she's not the crazy MIL, I don't see a problem with you speaking to her. Your husband already said he will make sure to never put herself or you in this position again. It sounded that you just needed someone to say that you made the right decision and that your husband is not defined by this situation.\n\nAsk your husband if your mother ever said something to him or behaved in a way that make him uncomfortable with you discussing your marriage with her, just to be sure, because it's pretty normal to discuss your marriage with your parents.\n\nNAH", "If no one has said it already, you can usually retrieve deleted photos off of your phone for 30 days.

Does he really think if you don't talk about it will be secret?", "NTA. You are allowed to talk to your mom. I do understand why he\u2019s upset though. In general I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s best not to vent to family/friends unless it\u2019s a situation where you need help or genuinely don\u2019t know how to proceed and need advice.

If my mom were alive I would definitely go to her. \nYou must have been so embarrassed, horrified, and ashamed by your husband's actions.

I'm exhausted just reading this. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.", "If he does this in front of you I can only imagine what he does when you aren't around.

But just remember, you might forgive and forget (most likely not) but your family never will.  I would just reiterate that this was a complex situation for you to process and you are only trying to se how to move forward.

NTA.", "I would never tell my\nMom something like that, but we aren\u2019t close to that level. I can\u2019t imagine my husband telling his mom embarrassing drunk stories of me either. The issue with telling family\nThings like this, is while you may forgive and move on, a lot of times they remember.", "I will get downvoted for this but ESH.\n\nHim for getting overly hammered. He must've been drunk out of his mind if he was still vomiting while in the car the next day. I don't even want to know how many drinks he had.\n\nBut you are the AH too. I have a huge problem with things between two people being aired out to others that aren't involved. Your family, especially your mom, will see him differently now and that's not a good thing. You both need to work on communicating, because talking to family or friends about the bad stuff he did is not a good thing. It's none of their business. Only yours and your husband's.\n\nI've been there before when I was kid who would misbehave and have outbursts, due to my Autism and ADHD, and my mom would air everything out to her coworkers and making me seem like a monster. Obviously, as I was a kid, I didn't really put it in my head how wrong it is, but as I got older, I really am disgusted, that my mom did that. I know these two situations are different, but they do share certain similarities. Just communicate.\n\nYou both crossed boundaries. And he's not normally like this, you admit. And you said you have a therapist, so why involve someone that your husband actually has to see very often and can disapprove of the marriage.", "Nta,\n\nImagine what he does when you're not around", "NTA im a big fan of not bad mouth my spouse to my family but there are time only a talk with your mum will help you sort things out in your head.\n\nHe acted inappropriately in public whilst drunk. You are the one living the embarrassment because he doesn't remember, you are the one who probably has doubts about what happens if he is that drunk again, will he flirt or more with someone else.\n\nYes he many be sorry and want it swept under the carpet but obviously it has really hurt you. Sometimes a therapist is too detached from the situation.", "NTA", "Your husband is angry at you because he\u2019s embarrassed of his own actions and he thinks it will go away if no-one talks about it. However, the shame is the consequence he has to work through. You have the right to talk about the upsetting aspects of your relationship with your trusted people. It\u2019s extremely unhealthy if the other person in the relationship limits what the other can talk about and seek perspective on, especially if alcohol in involved. Don\u2019t apologise. This is a time for your husband to be humble and really take a hard look on his reasons for drinking and what kind of behaviour (and why!) comes out.", "I think a big part of what might be bothering you isn't the embarrassment, it's the question , \"what would he have done if I wasn't there?\" It's not your job to cover up your husband's bad behavior and never speak of it so that he looks better than he is to other people. NTA. Your husband probably does rmemeber some of what happened and is hoping you will forgive and forget so he isn't in trouble.", "NTA\nYup, your husbsnd is completely embarrassed by his behavior, as he should be. And yup, maybe there are things your mother shouldn't know about your marriage. But this particular instance could be the catalyst for other behaviors and you might need help identifying if things are going wrong in the future. Maybe your husband will move forward and he won't drink to this extent again and there won't be any issues.  Or maybe your husband will pretend this never happened because he doesn't remember it and there's no proof anymore so next time there's a free bar off he goes again. And maybe next time his giggle buddy will be more willing to go further, and your husband will say he doesn't remember it and it's the \"first time\"... And maybe you call your mom and she reminds you to get your head out of your backside and  see what's really happening is that your husband isn't taking responsibility for his actions. So yes your husband is embarrassed and now your mother knows but this is hia opportunity to suck it up,  accept responsibility and take whatever criticism comes his way and learn from it.", "fuck around and find out. NTA", "ESH. Obviously he was completely out of line and fucked. \n\nIll share a similar situation. My wife once got equally drunk at one of my work parties, made an absolute embarrassment if herself and me- didnt do anything unfaithful but did do and say some really fucked up shit, vomiting all over the dance floor several times, while still smashing wine and refusing to slow down and get off the floor, screaming nasty shit at my bosses husband. It ended in her completely losing control qnd wanting to storm off blackout drunk in the middle of a sketchy part of town, obviously i wouldn't let it happen. I was holding her handbag  she tried to rip it off me, i held it tight she screamed \"YOU ARE HURTUNG ME\" in front of my workmates. Obviously they assumed the worst and never looked at me the same. I had to find a new job.\n\nOf course i was furious, she was extremely sheepish and apologetic the next day. It was completely out of character for her so i forgive her under the condition she never did it again.\n\nAs far as i am concerned if i started sharing her lowest moment to my family (which is now her family too) id be an ah. Im only sharing here cos its anonymous. \n\nPart of marriage is protecting each other, and that includes each others reputation.

Especially if you\u2019re working through them and your SO is actively trying to make changes. \n\nYOU may forgive your SO and get past it, but generally speaking your family will never forget it. They WILL look at him differently. It will affect his relationship with them. \n\nIf this was a one time thing, and he\u2019s never acted like that before, then I think you\u2019re blowing this way out of proportion. People do incredibly stupid things when they\u2019re drunk, and yes 100% it is his fault for being that drunk in the first place. But if he legitimately has never done something like it before, and he is actively taking steps to prevent it from happening again, then I think you need to get over it. And I do think YTA for spreading it to your family and embarrassing him even further than he already is. \n\nAnd yes, I am aware I\u2019m going to be downvoted for this. But \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Work out your marital problems with your husband like an adult. Vent to your friends, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. Don\u2019t vent to people who he will then be forced to interact with for the rest of his life and who might hold one evening (where he didn\u2019t cheat, but he DID make bad choices) against him forever. That\u2019s not cool.", "Info \u2014 does your husband often behave like this?", "NTA", "Nta per se but you could have went to her or did it at a time when he wasn't home. I say per se because he would have been none the wiser but you chose to do it in his vicinity. You must not be ready to deal. Which is fine but if your going to resent him just leave. Bringing others into your business can't end well even if your mom won't. Nothing is stopping her from going to other people with your business.", "NTA. Of course you should be able to confide in your mom. And your husband has no right to insist that you keep his behavior a secret. Also it seems problematic that he got blackout drunk.

You choose where you get the support you need. \n\nNTA", "I think YTA because it is never a good idea to bring your parents into your marriage. \nYou have a therapist for this, there was no need to vent to your mom, too. \nYou say your husband crossed a boundary. Well, you did too, when you told your mom about a situation that should have stayed between you and your husband. His behavior was gross but according to you it was a one-off and once he was made aware of it he was deeply apologetic. \nIt\u2019s understandable that you will need some time to work through your feelings but it doesn\u2019t excuse bringing you parent into your marriage.", "NTA.  He behaved this way in public, causing you hurt and embarrassment.  It\u2019s not like you told your mom a secret that he told you in confidence.", "OP, one of the differences between an enabler and a concerned spouse, is that an enabler keeps the secrets of the person with a problem, while the concerned spouse seeks help from appropriate sources.

While it isn't healthy to complain about every mistake your husband makes to outside parties, you absolutely have every right to seek support from your mother when he goes this far over the line. Please don't establish a dynamic in your marriage that forces you to process a situation like this in isolation. If his behavior is so bad you're forced to keep it a secret... that's a pretty big red flag that you absolutely should be talking through it with someone you trust.   \n\n\n He's the one who embarassed himself for all the world to see.

He kept refusing. Eventually I poured him into an Uber and spent the entire night taking care of him while he threw up. The next day, I drove us home while he kept throwing up into a bag in the car. He remembers none of the events from that night. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was *cheating* per se, but it was crossing a physical boundary. I didn\u2019t plan to bring it up, given how drunk he was, but he snapped at me over something innocuous (I thought he turned off subtitles on the tv when he hadn\u2019t) and I just boiled over like \u201cYEAH WELL I DIDNT DO WHAT YOU DID\u201d\n\nThen the whole thing came out, and I had pics but he didn\u2019t want to see them and insisted I delete them (now I wish I hadn\u2019t). He was extremely apologetic, said he had to rethink everything he thought about himself, swore off drinking, etc. I said fine, but it\u2019s going to take me time to reconcile myself to it, even if I know it was because you were revoltingly drunk. (Note- he does not get hammered like that regularly, it\u2019s extremely rare and I\u2019ve never seen it to that extent in the 4 years I\u2019ve known him)\n\nI talked about it to my therapist, which I told him beforehand I would, but I might have fucked up today because I went on the balcony and told my mom about it, but he overheard because I misjudged my volume. I just needed to vent to my mom, but I see how it seems like a betrayal to him. My mom is not an interfering crazy MIL, she in fact told me to make my peace with it since that\u2019s what I said I\u2019d do, but he\u2019ll be worried that she sees him in a different light now. \n\nMy opinion is, if there was no incident, then there wouldn\u2019t be an incident for me to talk about, would there? \n\nBut I think this is the kind of thing maybe I should have kept quiet from my family, if I truly was planning to move on from it. It\u2019s hard to keep quiet about something that you haven\u2019t moved past, even if the plan is to move past it in the future. I was having a very hard time at work, and while pouring out my troubles to my mom, this came pouring out too\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can trust certain friends to understand that my venting is giving them a very skewed perspective of my husband, because I do not come to them gushing over him. We trust each other to know that venting is not representative of a relationship and unless a line is crossed (ie. Abuse) my venting should not impact their relationship with him.\n\nWhile parents are a wonderful source of support, in my experience they are rarely able to make that differentiation. That one bad night will impact their relationship. If your mom is not like that then NTA, but if she is then ESH because while you have every right to vent, for the sake of your relationship it\u2019s important to consider how you may be impacting your husbands relationships with others and whether one bad night would greatly impact their treatment of him and if you feel it\u2019s deserved. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019ve never vented to my dad about my husband but it\u2019s always been pretty light, never anything serious (ie, our differences in when to fill gas - not my concerns with his drinking behavior which has been an issue for us as well).\n\nAll that being said, I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that.

She isn\u2019t TA but that doesn\u2019t mean she made the best choice.", "Still not quite getting whether you think my sober betrayal or his drunken betrayal was worse\u2026", ">I see how it seems like a betrayal to him...But I think this is the kind of thing maybe I should have kept quiet from my family, if I truly was planning to move on from it.\n\nSo you didn't mean any of that? Because you seem very resistant now to the idea that telling your mom might *also* make you an asshole.", "... a \"physical boundary\" is like a fence or a wall. Or if we want to color it in the terms of affair language, I could even see it as \"an item of clothing to be removed.\" But *none* of that is happening here?\n\nYou're upset at him crossing **_behavioral_** boundaries.\n\n> almost putting his face in her chest \n\n*Nothing* **physical** happened here, at all. Almost = didn't.", "Yeah he needs to understand that when he's the one who screws up and causes you emotional distress, you have to go to someone else for counsel and comfort cause it can't be him. If he doesn't like that then he needs to be more careful with his actions. As long as he comes to terms with that, and stops drinking beyond the occasional social drink, then I agree you should forgive him.", "Yeah I literally think they both thought they were having an awesome casual fun time and everyone thought they were hilarious. Hint: no one did and everyone was cringing", ">Screw those people, they could\u2019ve offered you help.\n\nNo, you don't try and \"check\" a drunk stranger, you get someone they know to check them, like their wife.", "that's still shameful??? he's married", ">People get drunk, there\u2019s no need to shame unless he was being creepy with multiple women.\n\nAt a wedding, OP's husband got blackout drunk and flirted loudly and actively enough with another woman that people had to come ask his wife to try and reign him in.  Depending on how hard she's trying, the bride and groom had their wedding marred by someone actively being inappropriate next to his wife, who's spending most of the time trying and desperately failing to tear her drunk husband from some random woman's ear and cleavage. \n\nThere's being drunk and passing out in a corner and there's being drunk and disruptive to the point that you're making a scene. OP's husband could not have been subtle in his approach if people during an event could see and hear it and feel strongly enough to say something. \n\nNTA, for OP though. OP's real questions are what would her husband have done if she wasn't watching him and is he remorseful or just trying to bury the issue by getting her not to talk about it and deleting the evidence?", "Oho! This is a fun fact. Recovered just now! Not sure if it\u2019ll make any impact though, he\u2019s not denying what he did, he just doesn\u2019t want any reminder of it", "I got them recovered! Not sure what good they\u2019ll do- he\u2019s not denying he did any of it, just doesn\u2019t want the reminders", "I personally don\u2019t think alcohol is the issue- it definitely exacerbated something, but to me the answer of \u201cif I quit drinking then I won\u2019t do anything sketchy\u201d is a cop out. You shouldn\u2019t have the notion to do anything sketchy even before alcohol hit your system. Alcohol just lowers your inhibitions of something already there", "That\u2019s exactly what I think it is. I don\u2019t want to erase the entire incident from memory just yet, I\u2019m not at that point. It definitely sparked some insecurities and uncertainties that will need to be acknowledged", "Yeah I know this is true- how many of my girl friends have complained about a man only to get back together the next day? But in this instance, I felt overwhelmed and humiliated, i haven\u2019t told my other girl friends about any of this. \n\nBut I think mom is a different story. Yes, it may change their relationship. But that is my mother and when I\u2019m at my most vulnerable, that\u2019s who I need the most. Sometimes you just want your mom", "Just cause I found out I could. I had a couple dog pics too. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need those pics for anything- my husband is not denying anything he did just doesn\u2019t want to remember. But the comments made me a bit wary if I might need to keep them for any reason. \n\nEither way- the dog pics stay.", "That\u2026 is a good question. I think the thing is, I don\u2019t feel that his remorse or attention is genuine. It\u2019ll be a couple weeks, and go back to normal. It\u2019s already started again, based on his reaction today. Half the time, I\u2019m like this huge burden that he has to deal with. Furthermore, he\u2019s already stated that his giving up alcohol is just temporary- he has no permanent plans for it. Again, just something to placate me for a couple weeks. \n\nSo what do I want from him? Genuineness. Don\u2019t do or say shit because you need to get out of trouble for a couple weeks.\n\nAfter this, he\u2019s gonna pick another fight (he\u2019ll probably pick one tomorrow) about me talking to my mom. So I\u2019d also like him to be the chill, stable, fun, normal guy who doesn\u2019t flip out every three seconds, that he used to be. That\u2019s what he can do to make it right. And act like he\u2019s attracted to me for like two seconds.", "Good point. It\u2019s fucking ballsy to make himself the victim here", "Thank you!", "No I don\u2019t think so, I think he was trying to acknowledge my feelings without being in denial and defensive mode. But ofc, now that my trust is shaken, idk", "You too! Thank you :)", "I will say that he was never defensive or argumentative. He didn\u2019t deny anything I said and took full accountability. But now that my trust has been shaken, it\u2019s hard for me to tell if that is genuine or another tactic", "She made the best choice for her maybe not the best choice for him but what other choice does she have when he refuses to even discuss it. A marriage is meeting the other halfway and he isn\u2019t at all. \nYour tone is making it very much appear as if she needed to protect his feeling above her own and that\u2019s why I said ew.", "She literally posted it here because she was open to that possibility.", "Resistant? Not at all. I\u2019m just saying that whatever long term impacts that telling my mom will have, those impacts are already happening anyway on me. So I\u2019m just suggesting that your statement of \u201chis drunken behavior was done after that night\u201d is not entirely accurate", "Ok, if you want to use semantics, then sure. I phrased it in the way that I saw it. To me, I call it a physical boundary. You can call it whatever makes sense to you", "Yes I do too. I\u2019m just (I think justifiably) angry and sad still. It hasn\u2019t passed yet but it will. I\u2019m not gonna hold onto this forever", "Absolutely. I hated that MY fun time was ruined. So, stupidity selfish. It took a handful of times with my husband before I stopped tolerating it. The last time was about 20 years ago and I cornered him and said in no uncertain terms if he didn't stop drinking, sit down, and behave himself that he would be bounced. We were in our 50s and I was just done. \n\nEvery time he swears he was just happy and having fun. I would say, I know but.... Now I go straight for the hard truth, befitting the situation and tell him this is not happening and you will hear about it for the next week if you don't stop. Make your choice now.\n\nBonus points happened when our kids grew up and chimed in that he was embarrassing and no one wanted him at parties if he was gonna act that way. \n\nGlad to say he mended his ways. But damn, nobody is cool when they can't hold their liquor, some poor soul ends up babysitting. That's messed up. \n\nOP, perseverance is required. You can be respectful and gentle, but draw a hard af boundary.", "You can offer help though, go get security. She was obviously struggling and embarrassed. And at a wedding, she said in another comment they were all his friends. Why didn\u2019t they help their friends wife with him, so screw their judgement.", "Yes, it\u2019s shameful for what he did to his wife in which he disrespected and embarrassed her.  \n\nI\u2019m saying I wouldn\u2019t care what others thought so much about him being drunk in general. Telling her to check him?  I personally would stay out of her business.  It\u2019s a big deal what he did and she needs to firmly tell her husband that but also those people were rude.", "It can be useful for you though! It's so easy to question your own reality and reactions - though you don't want to stoke your upset by looking at them a lot. Maybe hide them in a file somewhere and ignore them until some time in the future where they don't elicit feelings any more?", ">he just doesn\u2019t want any reminder of it\n\nHe didn't do this alone at home - he was at a wedding with IDK how many people, but he was noticed! Maybe being out of state he won't have people coming up to him locally saying \"haha dude you were so wasted\" but his behavior is not a secret. If he harrasses you for talking about it with your mom, he's added another layer of assholery to his original total assholeness. You are NTA and if I were in your situation, I'd want my husband to make it up to me by being extra kind and considerate, not being blamey and trying to erase that it happened.", "Also save them in another device or in your email. Just in case he wants to deny it ever happened again.", "I was just about to comment this, it\u2019s such a nice feature! I hope everything turns out ok!", "All of the advice you're getting here is from bitter people trying to relive their traumas through you. If your husband is a decent guy and this is an isolated incident, doing all of this saving of pictures in secret files is a gross overreaction that amounts to digging trenches in preparation for war. If that's not how you feel about your relationship, don't just arbitrarily build that kind of distrustful infrastructure into your heart and mind because strangers on the internet said so. Sounds like he fucked up and he's embarrassed and ashamed. Work through it like two people who love each other. Don't start packing the lifeboats because of one thing.", "I'm biatchy enough to email them to him a week before the next open bar event with a pointed reminder that a repeat will not be tolerated. \n\nWhat is the deal with people taking an open bar as a challenge to consume as much alcohol as humanly possible? I mean, yeah, enjoy yourself ... just don't get sloppy drunk, make everyone who isn't also sloppy drunk uncomfortable, and humiliate your partner in the process. \n\nI feel like that's actually a pretty minimal standard for the behavior of any adult in a social situation involving alcohol.", "That is wildly inaccurate.  Alcohol doesn\u2019t just lower your inhibitions it messes with your brain. \n\nThere are people who change who they are when they drink.  Theres reasons why some people cannot drink.\n\nHow alcohol affects people is different in every person, there\u2019s also genetic factors.  People are responsible for the actions when they drinks, because they chose to drink.\n\nIf he truly doesn\u2019t want to drink, it may not be an excuse.  It could be he realizes that alcohol makes him someone he doesn\u2019t want to be.", "I get it. We all need our emotional support person. I said it with love as a mom. We love our kids. Even if we don't judge, we also don't forget.", "I would try not to stare at the photos and get worked up but I wouldn't delete them. He says he's sorry and embarrassed now but a few months from now if he does something similar or just feels like lashing out, he could very well backpedal on his behavior. \"You're exaggerating, I wasn't that bad.\" The proof exists, I wouldn't delete it. Hopefully you never feel you need it.", "If you really want to get over this, staring at the pictures isn\u2019t going to help you do that\n\nAnd unless the pictures show him participating in sex acts, they won\u2019t go far in court which is what I assume people think you need them for\u2026evidence in your divorce. Which, these wouldn\u2019t be good for anyway because you\u2019re not claiming adultery and they don\u2019t prove adultery. If you want to move on, you\u2019ve got to stop revisiting it", "I think maybe you\u2019ve got more going on here than just what happened at the wedding, or you telling your mom. I think maybe y\u2019all should consider counseling together to get some help on where to go from here, what he can do to show real change, what you can do, etc etc", "I had an abusive ex who did this. Whenever he did something fucked up and I confronted him about it, I got \"why do you keep bringing it up? I already feel really bad for doing it, why do you keep trying to make me feel worse?\" It was some iteration of that over and over until I felt sorry for hurting his feeling and apologized.\n\nNow, I'm not saying your husband is abusive; what I'm saying is if this is how he reacts to you being upset about something he is clearly in the wrong for doing, that is manipulative behavior and he needs to stop doing it. \n\nIt's also unrealistic and unhealthy to expect you to seek emotional support from those closest to you to preserve his reputation that he has sullied himself by humiliating and hurting you. \n\nYou guys need to go to couple's therapy and sort this out.", "The specific **action** is in the past. That was indeed a correct assessment.\n\nIts *impact* on you may be an ongoing condition.", "What is security doing in this situation! While it may be embarrassing and gross, him and some random woman flirting isn't a security issue. \n\nOP handled the wedding night correctly. And others or security getting involved would've turned it into a possibly violent situation.", "Yeah that\u2019s probably what I\u2019ll do. It just sparks up my anger and sadness if I see them. Thanks for the tip though!", "OP, just replying here because please do save the pictures. My ex did something similar earlier in our marriage and then made me feel guilty that I wanted to seek help from my loved ones. \n\nOver 15 years he continued the cycle of screw up (often including alcohol), apology and saying he was changing his ways, and isolating me from support. He also didn't like any photo or video evidence I had but it was easier to permanently erase it then. With time and him downplaying the event its so easy to forget. \n\nSo send yourself an email with the pictures attached. Write down everything that's happened (which serves the duel purpose of getting it off your chest) and send it to yourself AND save a copy in draft. \n\nThe fact that he's trying to play victim now because you sought comfort and advice from your mom is ridiculous.  These are the consequences of his actions. All actions have positive or negative consequences.  If he doesn't want you mom to think badly of him, don't do anything for her to form that opinion.\n\nGood luck OP, I really hope this was a one-time incident, but the way he's acting now doesn't make me feel hopeful for you.", "Also useful if this guy has a serious alcohol problem and needs to be reminded how he behaved. \n\nBack up those pictures a couple of places.", "I feel like he\u2019s tried to be extra attentive and loving, and then the second something like this comes up, he immediately gets defensive again.

Not to this extent. He was always still the \u201clet\u2019s jump off the balcony, eat pizza, play beer pong, and pass out\u201d guy. \n\nHowever this incident is the only time I have EVER seen him display this kind of interest, even unwittingly, in someone else. And alcohol is not the common factor here based on pure observation. Quitting is obviously healthy, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s doing that. But to me, that doesn\u2019t solve whatever is the underlying issue", "Exactly what I just commented to the other person who asked why I even felt the need to recover the pics.

Even if he feels ashamed of himself, or at least embarrassed, he's piling more crap on you while he wallows in his feelings or his avoidance or whatever it is. \n\nHow would he have acted towards you if the situation were reversed. Would he have taken you home, nursed you back into the world and then been nonconfrontational while you shut yourself up in the bedroom at 7pm? \n\nIMO he's just used up a ten-year supply of \"well I'll let that slide\" credit in one evening at the wedding and now he wants to add to it by being whatever it is in the bedroom at 7pm escapist?", "He doesn\u2019t get to just shut himself up in the bedroom to not deal with it. Return the favor when he wants to talk to you.", "That's concerning. Is he actually taking responsibility for his actions and figuring out how to be absolutely certain it doesn't happen again? Or is he just being super obvious about \"making it up to you\" and not doing anything of substance? The fact that he's trying to hide from the full scope of what he did and then getting defensive when you have normal human responses to it (being upset, talking about it with someone you trust, etc) isn't a good sign.

Holding onto these pictures as if you'll need them is an inherently distrustful act. If you've been with this guy for 4 years and nothing like this has ever happened, doesn't it make more sense to err on the side of love and trust and try to move past it without intentionally holding onto pieces of it? If that ends up being a mistake in the future and he denies it, then you'll know that you misjudged his character. But for now, navigate by the love you have for him and the love he shows you, instead of listening to all these weirdos whose histories of broken relationships make them see love as a deathmatch in a snakepit.", "He\u2019s responsible for his actions, but bad behaviour when drinking doesn\u2019t mean thats what they actually want.\n\nAlcohol isn\u2019t a truth serum .
