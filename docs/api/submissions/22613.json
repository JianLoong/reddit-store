What stranger is going to rent a garage for 3 k a month and go into a house with 5 kids all strangers to pee at night?", "Sucker", "Let\u2019s be real, he watches 5 kids. Guaranteed the OP still expects him to be responsible for the 13yo. These kids, based on the OP\u2019s general attitude, are probably obnoxious. Good luck to them as they try to find childcare\u2014sounds like the cousin saw the writing on the wall a while ago.", "Its not that hard", "He's watching the 13yo. Even if the 13yo is in his room, playing video games, he's still supervising. I'm guessing if the 13yo started setting fires in the yard, it would be understood he would step in. Just because the 13yo doesn't require active attention and supervision, he's still watching the kid.\n\nLike, if your kids are sleeping, you still have to pay the babysitter.", "Exchanging. So not free as that person said.", "Lmfaoooo", "Grandpa told OP that if he didn\u2019t stop having so many damn kids, he was gonna leave everything to his cousin.", "Lmao. Landlord brain. So accurate", "100%! As a mother of 3, I always point out the wild parts first, so if they are easy, it's a pleasant surprise \ud83e\udd23", "Then you should had put them in school", "Our 1yo is the happiest boy.", "Here I\u2019ll help. BEACH ADJACENT PROPERTY. $3k month. Highly upgraded side building to shared home. Very friendly, dynamic family with a variety of personalities/ages. Shared kitchen/bath. Must be background checked. Pls bring references.", "He has two 1-3 year old children in his area that average price from all day care for that age range is $1,300 and isn't even checking to see what level of certification they have.", "This would require having a suite for the nanny to live in, so there'd be no rental income.\n\nWow. You've been getting a great deal thanks to your cousin.", "I\u2019m constantly told how wonderful my child is and what a joy he is to look after by childcare workers, why is this not reflected on the bill?!", "You're the AH just based on your responses to the people trying to explain why you're wrong.", "Wow. YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA!\n\nI hope your kids' mother is more of an adult than you are.", "Oh so you\u2019re actually just looking to profit off of your BIL while taking advantage of his child care services", "You really have no clue about the costs involved in hiring a live-in nanny. It's really quite shocking that you've checked rent prices, but haven't bothered to check prices for childcare.", "Quit cranking out kids if you don't even know what they fuckin cost", "Nah they\u2019re \u201cmostly nice\u201d according to another comment \ud83e\udd23", "You do it then.", "Then do it yourself.", "Looking after 5 kids isn't hard? LOLOLOL. Kick out your babysitting and try doing it yourself.", "If it\u2019s not that hard you should parent your children you chose to have.", "I suggested you price out the replacement cost for someone to watch all those kids before you go put your foot in your mouth and ruin a good thing. You have a person you trust who takes good care of your kids living on-site and willing to step in at any time. Anyone else will require mandated days and time off, benefits, premium hourly wage for the number of kids (who wants to manage 5 kids if they can just deal with two for the same money?), and you would still have to offer subsidized rent.", "Then why aren\u2019t you doing it? Why do you need a nanny? It\u2019s not hard\u2026the kids watch themselves!!", "truly spoken like someone that has never taken care of a kid in his life", "Then *YOU* watch *YOUR* kids, since its not that hard.", "Ok you do it entirely for 2 months then come back and tell us how not hard it is purely for your 2 under 5", "You only think it\u2019s not that hard because you have someone else doing it for you.", "I suggest doing some research into how much a live in babysitter for 4 kids would actually cost", "Then hire someone and pay them", "\"Watching\" is a very loose term. As long as there is an adult present, they are responsible for that child. They don't need to be hovering over them every minute.", "I would totally watch your kids. \ud83d\ude06", "Yes let\u2019s put the 8 month old in school", "Explain what school you can put a child younger than 5", "School?  That's hilarious.", "You should have kept your legs closed.", "Ignoring the stupidity of saying you should put a baby in school, the lower price is because now it's day care *after school*. Kids needs watching after the school bell rings until you decide to show up and parent.", "Tell me you have no idea of the reality of legitimately getting and paying for childcare without telling me", "So that means he should pay you for the privilege of babysitting him? \n\nHe has already let you know that he will not continue to be a caregiver for your children if he has to pay rent. People don't pay to be the nanny.", "Why isn\u2019t he in SCHOOL ?? I mean if you think an 8 month old should be\u2026", "Of course you think that, how much time do you spend with him every day?", "The 1 y old you think you can just toss into school?   \ud83e\udd23.   Happy doesn\u2019t mean much when they still need help wiping their own ass.", "Seriously, you need to think about what will happen to your life if he takes himself right out the door and leaves.", "How do you know. Did you ask Mark?", "I didn\u2019t even realize he had 2 under 5! Yeah that\u2019s going to drive the price WAY up! He\u2019ll be expecting the renter paying 3k to also provide free childcare \ud83d\ude02 maybe if he can\u2019t afford the area he should move \ud83d\udc40", "$1,300 a month", "Fuck me, just looking after one kid is my personal hell", "If or when the cousin has had enough, I\u2019m betting good money that the 13yo will be left in charge of the siblings. Cause, you know \u201cit\u2019s not that hard\u201d.", "He doesn't watch the 13yo anymore", "Worst case scenario the 11 yr old can always drive the 1 yr old to the ER, ya know in a pinch", "Right?? Like trust me, that kid was in school the second he was eligible \ud83d\ude05", "I can\u2019t stop laughing but I really want to know what this looks like. Do they have teeny tiny desks and little glasses? Is the whiteboard like 6 inches off the floor? Do they take notes on post its cause they have tiny hands, and use golf pencils?", "Lol..yeah...even the district I lived in...which had pre k for four years old, the schedule was light and a child in it would still need a lot of child care around it.  And our K program was every other day.", "Exactly like that budget is blown wide open, he may even want to give mark some spending money!", "I feel like you\u2019re not taking into account the luxury garage accommodations", "If it wasn't  that hard you wouldn't have needed him to move in in the first place.", "He's still responsible for the 13yo. Doesn't matter that the 13yo I more I dependant", "You're being obtuse. \n\nEverybody is telling you, you'd be crazy to start asking rent, because you won't break even if he starts billing hours. \n\nYou don't want to hear it, why did you even come here?   \n\n\nYTA", "Boy, you are a broken record", "Use a phone book to boost the seat, a pair of mom\u2019s platforms to reach the pedals, all good.", "Exactly! Any public preschool program makes it even harder to be a working parent because they go for 3 hours during the most inconvenient hours of the day.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Ah yes, a stunning 1000 square foot space with central ac and heating probably."]}
