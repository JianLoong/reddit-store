Kind of silly to continue the conversation once her hustle was exposed. TBH, pretty bold of her to basically beg you for a drink, then get mad when you called her out.", "NTA, there's a lot of room for neither or both of you to really be the asshole here, but the date really tips the scale. She knew what she was doing on Valentines Day. Also, the fact that she was thinking of cheating on her boyfriend makes her a grand asshole past the scale of this post.", "NTA. I\u2019m so confused by this thread, have half the commenters even gone to a bar before in their life??

No that is just plain weird and rude. While I agree buying a drink shouldn\u2019t just mean you can expect to get laid, that normally is for when a man walks up to a woman and offers to buy her a drink. When a woman asks you to buy her a drink randomly, there is nothing wrong with assuming she is into you. That is how it goes 99 percent of the time. Now if you would have tried to pressure her or hold it over her head you would be an asshole and weird. But none of that happened.", "NTA simply because it's weird to ask this. If you had offered, and she said yes, and you expected something, and then she said she had a bf, it'd be different, because you'd be initiating the conversation/purchase with expectations (at a bar, on valentine's day), but it's bizarre for her to ask, then say that, then say she would've cheated with you. If I've been offered while in a relationship I've said that, and sometimes still had a nice conversation aftward, but this seems very odd, not sure what her goal was", "NTA man, a lot of weirdos in here. A woman asking you to buy her a drink is a very clear signal. It\u2019s not like you expected to be buying sex from a woman for the price of a drink, but there is some kind of an open door to some flirting and maybe more. And people are just ignoring she was going to make out with you when she had a boyfriend? Absolutely crazy behavior all around, but you should know better than to ask Reddit.

I'm pretty pro-polyamory, but it sounds like you didn't have enough context to determine whether or not that's the case, and it's a fair and safe assumption that it wasn't, so she came onto you under false pretenses. It sounds like she was just trying to get a free drink, which is classless af.\n\nAs for the bar, I'd find a new one.

She appeared single and approached him and asked him for a drink, a standard signal of interest. And even though she said she was broke, she was eating food right next to him. That could very well just be another excuse to talk to him.\n\nAnd seriously, what reason did she have to genuinely believe that anyone would buy her a drink purely to be kind? No one does that.

In any case, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the bad guy by any stretch. Based on the information that was provided, I don\u2019t really think either one of them are the AH.

That says more about you and your attitude towards women than anything.\n\nI wonder how you'd feel if a guy came up  to you, told you he was broke, and asked you to buy him a beer. Would you assume he was gay and hitting on you?
