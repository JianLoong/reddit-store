No that is just plain weird and rude. While I agree buying a drink shouldn\u2019t just mean you can expect to get laid, that normally is for when a man walks up to a woman and offers to buy her a drink. When a woman asks you to buy her a drink randomly, there is nothing wrong with assuming she is into you. That is how it goes 99 percent of the time. Now if you would have tried to pressure her or hold it over her head you would be an asshole and weird. But none of that happened.", "NTA simply because it's weird to ask this. If you had offered, and she said yes, and you expected something, and then she said she had a bf, it'd be different, because you'd be initiating the conversation/purchase with expectations (at a bar, on valentine's day), but it's bizarre for her to ask, then say that, then say she would've cheated with you. If I've been offered while in a relationship I've said that, and sometimes still had a nice conversation aftward, but this seems very odd, not sure what her goal was", "NTA man, a lot of weirdos in here. A woman asking you to buy her a drink is a very clear signal. It\u2019s not like you expected to be buying sex from a woman for the price of a drink, but there is some kind of an open door to some flirting and maybe more.

A man buying you a drink doesn't buy him time with you or mean you owe him anything.\n\nBut I also find it off-putting for a woman to beg a guy for a drink, then tell him she has a BF. It might not be illegal, but it's not nice either.
