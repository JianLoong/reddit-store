When we went to the hair dressers, Kasey wanted a shorter bob with some layers, which is a pretty big difference from her waist-length hair. I thought it was fine since she was excited about it and it was just hair. I also thought it was fine since she was a teenager, and assumed that she was the one normally picking her own haircuts previously and that she just wanted a change.\n\nAnyways when I sent her parents a picture in the group chat, my brother-in-law immediately called me and blew up. He was really pissed off at me for letting Kasey cut her hair so short and that she now \"looked like a boy\". My sister didn't really say much, but now I'm getting messages from our mom and dad saying they're on their way to pick up Kasey. I've been talking it through with my parents and they don't exactly agree with my brother-in-law, but says I still should've asked them first or stopped them from cutting it too short.

You can't read their minds. His anger and insult is unacceptable. Stating your 16 yr old is not feminine after a haircut is outrageous and could be quite upsetting to Kasey.\n\nShe is 16 not 6 yrs old. Let her decide on how her hair should be cut and styled. They sound controlling and not in touch with the reality: In less than two years she won't be a minor. You took on a great opportunity to be with Kasey; don't let their blow-up from Spain drain your fun.", "NTA. Doing the maths.  Sister = 38, BIL = 52.  So when niece was born, sister was 22, and BIL 36.  When they were dating sister was ??? what a teen?  BIL was over 30 (we hope).   If they married when she was 38 and he was 52 well, that is two grown adults with life experience.  But a 21 year old and a 35 year old? That is a whole different dynamic.  Im not surprised your sister said nothing - probably doesn't have a say in much........\n\nNiece is 16 - she can have whatever hair cut she wants - but it does sound like she took the opportunity to do what she wanted without daddy around to veto her decisions.  Kudos to her - you just got caught in the middle of something it appears you may not have noticed before........", "NTA\n\nFor pity's sake, she's 16 years old. Old enough to decide how she wants to wear her hair. Her parents are way too controlling on this.", "Absolutely NTA. She\u2019s more than old enough to pick her own haircuts, I\u2019m glad you gave her the opportunity to express herself. Her dad sounds controlling, keep looking out for her if you can", "NTA\n\nYou had approval from her parents for a haircut and pixie-style cuts (edit: or short bobs, both) are completely normal. And she's 16 -- old enough to pick a style. It's not like she shaved her head.\n\nYour parents probably know you did nothing wrong but they don't want to upset their SIL (who is an AH) because it would make their daughter's life difficult.\n\nYou innocently stepped on a mine.", "Defintiely NTA. She is 16 and more than capable of choosing her own haircut. She also had permission from her parents who did not put any rules in place (but tbh rules for a 16 year old haircut is kind of ridiculous anyway). \n\nAlso, sounds like she potentially waited for the parents to be away so she could get the hair she wanted.", "NTA.  The \u201clooking like a boy\u201d outrage from dad is strikes me as a red flag personally.  That whole reaction from a father toward a 16 year old is just weird and unsettling to me.", "NTA.\n\nShe's 16, she can pick her own hair length. How controlling of them. It's her hair, not theirs.", "NTA - she\u2019s 16 and more than able to choose what kind of haircut she wants. Hair grows. Her dad is being controlling. Let the kid express her individuality and try new things. Changing hairstyles can do wonders for her confidence and self-esteem.", "NTA\n\nShe's old enough to pick her own haircut. Her dad sounds like a real controlling AH", "NTA my daughter went and got  her hair cut off at that age. I was surprised, but not upset.", "NTA. They're control freaks and she probably seized the chance to be able to cut off that Christian marriage mane they had her burdened with like she's some pony they're raising to sell off or something\ud83e\udd26 it's a disgusting attitude for them to have a about something so harmless \n\nHair grows back, and she's 16 - Heck even if she were 5 imo she should be able to choose her hairstyle she's a small human being not a frickin doll. Her Having bodily autonomy is something good parents should be encouraging not punishing her for\n\nas for \"looking like a boy\" wtf who cares? it's a bob that's a pretty feminine short hairstyle & her dad is massively creepy for saying that- she doesn't owe him or anyone else a \"feminine appearance\"\n\nI remember not being allowed to have short hair then when I finally did it myself because I was fed up with it my mother literally went into hysterics sobbing crying and wailing \"your beautiful hair!\" it was fucking gross and made me feel like shit but I still enjoyed having short hair and kept it short trying different styles growing it out occasionally for years ... \n\nAnd she even ended up at some points paying for me to go get it trimmed imo once that taboo of \"you must never cut your long hair\" is broken most parents realise that it's just hair and compared to other teenage \"rebellion\" it's no big deal and it might in some cases stop teens from rebelling in more harmful ways like with drugs etc if they're allowed that safe way to 'rebel' from expectations \n\n I'm trans though so my situation is a bit different though at that age I didn't know I was trans/didn't have the words for it/didn't feel ready to admit it to myself let alone others... \nIronically now that I'm further in my transition and have facial hair I actually enjoy having long hair again \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. You were watching your niece, she let her parent know she was cutting her hair for the summer (Aka, probably short), mom consented, and your niece got her hair cut. Hair grows. There may be a cultural component that is complicating matters, and there are certainly some gendered expectations going on for your BiL. However, with her being 16yo how much could you *really* control her decisions? \n\nUnless there is some significant information left out I don't think you could be at fault here. I hope they don't blow this up further and ruin your relationship with your niece and other family members. You were kind enough to host your niece for the summer and they should expect you to have some autonomy while doing so.", "NTA. Your niece is old enough to make her own decisions about her hair. She\u2019s also clever enough to wait until her parents are away and her less-strict auntie is in charge, which leaves you stuck in the middle. Smart kid, but I\u2019d have a talk with her about looping you in next time.", "NTA - Kasey is going to remember this fondly, as you've granted her a small bit of freedom that it seems her parents dont want her to have. Even if you DIDNT get their permission, honestly, you would still not be the AH: she's 16, you got it professionally done, and its not like a haircut is permanent!", "NTA at 16 she should be allowed to choose her own hair style", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there were rules attached to how long or short her hair was allowed to be, they should have told you. I\u2019m guessing you can\u2019t read minds and had no way of knowing that dude would flip about the hairstyle chosen", "First, NTA. It's Kasey's hair. She clearly didn't like her previous style and she has a right to change that.\n\nHowever, what's your BIL's view on religion and tradional gender roles? I have a sneaking suspicion he's... rather conservative, shall we say? Seeing as he's the one who blew up, and your sister gave the permission, I can't help thinking he's the one who wanted the hair long.\n\nKudos for being a cool aunt and listening to your niece.", "NTA.  Sounds like your 52-year-old BIL is a controlling jerk.  Your sister gave permission for her to get her hair cut; if dear old dad had any caveats, he should have made them clear at that time.  Dad is mad at the wrong person.", "NTA it's honestly super creepy that her step father is talking about her that way", "Thanks for understanding. I was kinda shocked to say the less when he blew up on me. I thought it was fine since Kasey seemed really excited to get her haircut and I thought it would've been even weirder if I stepped in and told her not to do it.\n\nI assumed that 16 was a perfectly good age to pick your own hair length without judgement from her parents", "My bad, totally should've included this information. They met when she was 30 got married when she was 32. Kasey was a kid from my brother-in-law's previous marriage, but never knew her mom so she took to my sister and our family really well.", "A short layered Bob would still be way longer than a pixie. It is usually at least chin length but bobs are generally shoulder length or just below. It would be concerning if he reacted like that over a super short cut like a pixie but saying that over a shoulder to chin length hair is really really concerning.", "I really didn't think anything of it. Especially since it's just hair and most people, especially since she's a teenager as well, just like to try new things. I thought it was so weird when her dad tried to take this as me actively spiting him and going behind his back", "Exactly, I honestly thought that she just wanted to try new things and being that I used to dye my own hair all crazy colors back in college I thought it was fine. \nShe definitely was super happy with it though despite her dad which I'm glad!", "\"Marriage mane.\" My immediate thought was extremely conservative Christian too. But I've never heard marriage mane before!", "Unfortunately, that's probably part of *why* she was so excited; because she's never had that much freedom over her own hairstyle before.", "Ah ok this makes more sense, but still concerning that dad over reacted like this\u2026\u2026it\u2019s not his hair\u2026..", "Right? Like, even the shortest bob is in no way a \"make me look like a boy\" cut unless your view of masculinity/femininity is *very* skewed.", "I thought the same thing. I knew a girl from a very Christian family with super long hair, and she told me that she kept it long because no man would want to marry her with short hair. It was also pretty sad that marriage was her main goal at 19.", "He thinks it is, in fact, his. Which is gross.", "When I start looking back on things, I think her dad has always been a lot stricter on Kasey because of this. When they first got married, I remember my sister telling me that she didn't want to undermine his parenting as a stepmom.", "It's also nothing new - I'm almost 72 and the first time I remember my parents not talking to each other was when dad came to find Mom had taken herself and us two older girls in and got us all pixies when we were like 6 and 2 - she was tired of untangling the snarls every morning (very curly hair).  Radio silence for about 3 days.  Good part was - he never said anything about our hair again except to go brush it."]}
