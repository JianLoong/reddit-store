I've had to compromise on a lot of things that matter to me that I would not have to compromise on were I dating another Jew, and I know my girlfriend has compromised a lot for me as well. Dating someone who was actively a Christian would be a hard boundary for me--I would never be able to be comfortable building a life with someone whose belief system is based on the idea that my religion and culture are an obsolete placeholder that's been superceded by theirs.

You can imagine the heartache and pain that would come if OP were to marry this woman, have kids with her, and a decade from now she breaks down and admits she can't do it anymore and doesn't believe and wants to raise her kids something completely different. It'll almost certainly mean divorce and contention that could have been avoided if they had both known she wasn't genuinely ready to commit to the religion.\n\nSometimes people do change their minds, it happens and it can suck - but there's a *big* difference between a person walking into a marriage genuinely understanding what's being asked and committing to it then having a change of heart vs a person who doesn't understand the magnitude rushing into a bad situation.", "I got Jewish vibes as well and felt the brother was particularly out of line.

It can be an absolute disaster if it only falls apart after kids are in the picture, too, so yes I would wholeheartedly discourage that and openly frown on people converting just for a relationship.\n\nHowever people can make massive commitments to major lifestyle changes because they're in love with someone and that person is worth the change.

Your mental health matters and this is a very reasonable boundary. Other peoples' curiosity isn't a reason to cause yourself issue.", "The continued existence of a religion is NOT more important then the actual people who subscribe to that religion.\n\nWould you *really* say to a Jew (Muslim, Christian, Pagan, Buddhist, Atheist) who is love with someone of a different creed that they should stay in their lane to propagate their faith by breeding with someone else they don't love?\n\nI wouldn't.
