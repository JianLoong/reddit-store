Is he this kind and welcoming with other things?", "You are NTA but your brother certainly is. He is more interested in keeping up appearances and forcing his views on everyone else than in seeing you find love and happiness. And this is despite the fact that your gf is prepared to convert.", "NTA. My dad converted to Judaism to marry my mom. It's much harder to convert to Judaism than most religions, but he attended classes, learned Hebrew, even got the old snippety doo. He is now a proud Jewish man, they have been married for 40 years and have three kids who love them. Just because it wouldn't have happened without my mom, his original reason doesn't make his conversion any less sincere,", "NTA- your brother sounds jealous. \nIt's up to your GF to follow her spiritual journey.", "NTA... If she is making this choice on her own then it's totally up to her. \n\nRegardless of her reasons.", "If love ain\u2019t a good reason to be religious there are none.", "NTA. As you say, it's up to your girlfriend and her teacher to determine the appropriateness of her conversion. It should be her decision to convert for her own reasons. And you should tell her this. I wouldn't either encourage or discourage her from converting to a different faith.", "NTA. I converted for similar reasons for your girlfriend (to the same religion, I think) and it was not an easy journey. This is not the cheat code your brother seems to think it is. \n\nYou're not breaking the rules. If anything, your brother is doing that by trying to vet her sincerity.", "NTA I also wonder what religion would prevent people from converting to get married but regardless. Your gf genuinely wants to practice your faith, she clearly respects as well as loves you and if and when you marry she will practice the religion. I\u2019ve known many couples in which one has converted and they\u2019ve raised a wonderful family that practices their faith. I think your family may be judging prematurely.", "Your brother doesn't get to gatekeep your relationships or who gets to join your religion.\n\nNTA", "People convert all the time. \nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou obviously know her better than your brother does, you have a much better perspective on how genuine her conversion is. \n\nI'm sure you and your brother also know people born into the religion that just aren't devout. Idk, I'm not religions, but I think finding a religion and converting is a really beautiful thing, and the most genuinely faithful person I know is my Muslim aunt that was raised Catholic.", "NTA. Ludging other people's faith is not your brother's job. He should be worried about his own.", "I converted to Latvian Orthodox for a woman, but then she moved to Latvia for a year. \n\n(NTA)", "Sounds like she wants to convert to Judaism? A rabbi is supposed to turn away a person three times before agreeing to work with them to be sure it\u2019s what they want and they are converting for themselves and not someone else. That\u2019s their job, and not your brother\u2019s.", "NTA\n\nYou and your girlfriend are the only opinions that matter here.", "YTA.Any relationship founded on the basis of conversion is awful.Changing your beliefs\u2014sometimes an entire lifestyle\u2014just for one person never ends well.If you truly loved her,you wouldn\u2019t have her convert to your religion;instead,you\u2019d love her for who she is,not her religious beliefs.", "Can we ask what religion is this?", "info: What are your ages?", "Your brother is just being protective of you, your afterlife and your faith. Of course it would be upsetting if you didn't get his blessing but this is only really the business of you and God.\n\nIf you're meant to be then, if it is what he wishes it'll be given to you.\nIt seems she is already being called for within this faith which is a great sign.\n\nIt will be really difficult for you if she is doing this for you. Keep your feet on the ground.\nIt might be hard for you to see as you never came into your faith the way this lady will. It's a massive change in so so many ways especially so young but she will be rewarded in many many ways if it's what she still decides.\n\nYou're NTA for sure but like I said, make sure it's for her own religious reasons and protect yourself from mistakes you can't take back. \n\nYou know that if you posted this in your religions community you'd get very different answers.", "YTA\n\nYour brother is in fact correct.\n\nIf she is just going through all these motions to be with you, it is absolutely a mockery of your religion and culture.\n\nIt is not the Rabbi's job to convince people to convert.\n\nAnd clearly the reason she wants to convert is because of you, not because of any strongly held beliefs.\n\nYou are free to be with anyone you want, but are absolutely in the wrong here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You for excluding the idea of a relationship with someone who has a different belief system. Him for thinking that any of this is anything to do with him.\n\nHow can you allow your belief system override your own feelings about a person? Stop internalising other people's disapproval and live your own life.", "He isn't. He's telling the truth. You cannot convert for love. It would invalidate the marriage if not.\nYou must only convert because you believe the religion true. Which, luckily it seems like she might actually be that way inclined.", "It sounds to me like everyone in the family shares his religious view, he's just the only one who thinks GF is being insincere in her reasoning.", "Damn imagine cutting off an important part of your genitals just to marry someone, at least he consented.", "Latvian Orthodox has the best hats", "Quite literally has no effect on the argument.

Will they go to hell? \ud83d\ude22", "Well because no one should have to give up true love for their religion, I don't think there's a God that says no. It's people who say no and people who make the community around them. She wants to convert because she loves you and feels it's the only way to be with you, not because of your religion but because it's everyone around you saying that it can be the only way.", "I wondered the same thing, and not to start anything, but, because it's background, and its a lot bigger deal if she is converting to or from Christianity to Judaism/Islam, or vice versa than just across denominations.", "I'm honestly just curious what religion for the sake of learning about it. Mind just saying it?", "I myself am curious simply because I like learning about different religions.", "Only she can know whether her desire to convert is authentic, but you're both old enough to have the experience to decide this and presumably the classes and instruction with a leader in your faith will help her determine whether it's really what she wants to do. I'd say NTA", "No, it isn't.  \n\nIt is an institution designed around the collective belief in a higher power and spiritual calling.\n\nA good Rabbi would absolutely turn away a potential convert until they proved they were serious.\n\nAnd doing the right thing for the wrong reason is still wrong, which is why you can't just convert for the sake of a relationship.\n\nAll of you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about here, because none of you believe in anything other than yourselves.", "His brother is angry because op is in a relationship and follows his desires.\n\nIf she had converted already (for religious reasons) they would be married by now and there would be no issue. Or at least courting in the correct way and leading onto marriage.\n\nThe religious figure will let her know (if he discovers relationship) that what they're doing currently is forbidden. \nIt seems plutonic though so that is good for them. Better, anyway. Than if it was a full on and also physical relationship.", "Culture and tradition are only as important as the person makes them. OP has made their importance known and it's really scummy to try to pressure and force someone to comfort to your beliefs.", "This reply is nonsensical.\n\nNo one is pressuring the GF to convert.  Nor are they pressuring her not to.\n\nThe brother is correctly stating that unless she would still pursue conversion *without* the relationship being attached, then it is not sincere.\n\nThe OP is therefore being selfish and supporting the mockery of his faith.\n\nThis isn't complicated.  He is free to leave his church, or more likely be excommunicated, and marry whoever he pleases.\n\nNo one else has to go along with or support his decision.  If everyone thought as he did, there would be no church at all.", "The brother is trying to pressure op to pressure his gf.  So yes there was pressure. \n\nAnd if the church can't stand the test of people marrying for love, maybe it shouldn't exist"]}
