First of all I want to get this straight: I love my sister, I'd give her a kidney in a heartbeat if she needed it. I just don't *like* her. I don't think we'd be friends if we weren't sisters.\n\nShe and I were very close when we were young and got along really well, however we drifted apart when I grew up. I wasn't always nice to her and vice versa. I didn't like it when she tried to hang out with me and my friends and I realise that she only did it to get close to me but at the time it was  annoying.\n\nLately, I've been trying to be nicer to her and improve our relationship as I will be leaving the country for university in July but she makes it incredibly hard to stay civil. She is incredibly mean to our mother, is disrespectful and also very catty. There have been several occasions where I caught her hanging out with someone only to talk badly about them to her friends afterwards. Also, when she asks to borrow my clothes and when I say yes, she comes into my room and claims she is \"drowning\" in them.\n\nYesterday, she cried because she realised that we are the same pant size and she doesn't want to be fat like me. We are both at a healthy weight for our height so I don't get where she got the fat comment from but whatever. This makes me feel like crap to be honest because I've really been trying to get along with her and feel like my efforts are in vain.\n\nAlso during dinner, she always tries to make my achievements seem like nothing. I do the IB and recently got accepted to a very prestigious university in the field that I want to study. During dinner last night, when I shared the news with my parents, she immediately said \"Wow, they must be taking anyone since your grades are really low and your CV is garbage.\"\n\nAnyways this comment made me furious and 12 years worth of resentment poured out of me. I yelled at her that she was a horrible person and that I hope she knows she will die alone and unhappy if she doesn't change. She cried and ran to her room and my parents told me that while I was right to be angry, I had no right to yell those things at my sister.\n\nI've been getting calls and messages from family members to apologise but I don't want to. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Obviously the 12 years of resentment is an exaggeration, we haven't been getting along since she was 13.\n\nCONTEXT: I have a history of struggling with food and am currently recovering from a restrictive ED. I have gained a healthy amount of weight which is why we are both at the same pant size.

Your sister was going for the jugular with those comments. Your parents should have stepped in and defended you.", "NTA tbh. She needed the wake up call on her bitchiness. If anything, maybe you were the one who helped her realize she'd gone too far.", "I think you both can benefit from some distance.  Maybe she can be civil if she sees you at Christmas break, or something.\n\nCongratulations on your college acceptance! You are off to a great start, your sister shouldn\u2019t have shit on it.\n\nAnd, yes, she will be alone and unhappy if she doesn\u2019t get a grip. (I think she is jealous of you. With you away, she might straighten up a little).  But-whatever. Sucks for her. NTA", "I do not think you are the AH at all here. When I was younger, maybe 8-14 yo my siblings would always tell me how difficult I was and that I was never going to find anyone and be alone. Siblings say things out of anger, pain, and frustration but they never really mean it. \n\nIf your sister truly made those comments about your weight and education - she is the supreme AH of the day. A lot of siblings go through fluctuations of being close and being distant. \n\nI think your sister may have some mental health concerns to address before becoming a better version of herself. Don\u2019t take it personal and just ride the wave to college. One day she will learn that you need to lead with kindness and until that day, life will be difficult for her.", "Clearly your sister isn't in your school's IB program. That curriculum is so hard that graduating with top grades from it gets you into the most prestigious universities in the world, *and* you walk in with most/all of your freshman year done. Some US universities even give you enough credits from IB to cover your sophomore year as well... with 'so-so' grades. Congratulations on your accomplishments!!\n\nBut maybe I'm being generous and your sister is perfectly aware of your academic achievements and just has a deep seated need to put you down. Which is worse.\n\nBut, you don't just have a sister problem, you have a parent problem. Your parents aren't helping her by saying that you need to use kinder words. Her behavior *is* going to isolate her as an adult, and it's their job to correct that behavior and/or figure out why she's just an inherently mean person. But they're protecting and enabling her, which allows her to hurt you and others.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she expected you not to clap back. Put her in her place.", "ESH.\n\nSo when you were your sister age you \"drifted apart\" from her, and now you're more mature and want to reconcile you're shocked your sister is behaving more or less like you did at her age ?\n\nThat's a funny.", "NAH. \nYour sister sounds jealous and insecure. You may have been too rejecting, harsh and critical when she tried to hang out with you and your friends. Not blaming, merely pointing out that you might take a look at why she's so critical of you or why you've grown so far apart.\n\n\nYou're at a turning point now, and can begin to fix it. Sit down with your sister and your parents and CALMLY explain  her comments hurt you, that you feel like your interactions have become predominantly negative, and that you'd like to rebuild friendship with her for the few months you have left in the house. \n\n\nTake time to listen to her but commit to CALMLY pointing it out if/when she criticizes you in future (\"Sis, that's the kind of thing that I think is hurtful\"), and then CALMLY disengaging. \n\n\nPracticing this will help you in any upcoming roommate situations and to be a mature advocate of your boundaries. I wish you all the very best.", "ESH. I went through similar years with one of my sisters. We loved each other but we struggled hard to get along for more than a few minutes at a time. We were both teenage girls and focused on our own drama while trying to navigate the difficult teen years. She said some terrible things to me, I said some terrible things to her.\n\nAs the younger child I will tell you that your sister's crummy attitude is likely at least in part due to jealousy. You're older, doing well, moving ahead with your life and she probably feels left behind a bit, especially if you were close up until a few years ago.\n\nI know it stinks to be the one to feel like you always have to take the high road, but try to remember that in another few years you'll both be adults and your relationship will change again, hopefully for the better. My sister and I are good friends now, but it didn't start to happen until we were in our mid twenties.", "A very gentle ESH. She's 15. Do you think you were a perfect angel at 15? Heck, do you think you're perfect now?\n\nTeen years come with a lot of growing pains and a lot of words spoken in anger/jealousy/the heat of the moment that you'll (both) likely cringe about in your adulthood. It's part of the experience. Try to be more patient with your sister. Try to be more patient with yourself. Congratulations on your college acceptance :)", "ESH she\u2019s 15 and your both doing and saying horrible things. You both need to grow up", "ESH. You\u2019re only 17, are you any closer to not dying alone and unhappy? You\u2019re both acting your age, there\u2019s nothing more to it. Your feelings are valid, and quite justifiable by your description, but your actions are not. \n\nYour sister is 15. I\u2019m sure in some way, her (unjustifiable) actions of attempting to diminish your accomplishments, may even be out of a place of not wanting you to go. And that\u2019s one possibility, it\u2019s a twisted one, but perhaps there\u2019s a real lack of understanding here on both parts \u2014 because of a lack of proper communication. \n\nYou could just tell her how you feel about the things she says. You could tell her your intention is to be close before you go. Etc. But yelling at her, saying catty things back, is not going to accomplish anything but the opposite.", "Congrats on your success, that\u2019s awesome!\n\nYour sister sounds like she\u2019s hurting, to be treating you like this\n\nIt\u2019s normal for teens to rebel, and they say very hurtful things, so add that to you having this success and leaving her behind, that\u2019s huge for her. Your parents are probably very proud of you, which may make her feel a bit less-than too\n\nInstead of fighting, who not try just calling her out on any future mean comments - just say \u201cthat\u2019s hurtful\u201d and let it go - realize she\u2019s saying it to hurt you, probably because she feels bad about herself, or angry at you for leaving, or worried she\u2019s growing up too but won\u2019t be able to succeed like you, or scared she won\u2019t see you again when you\u2019re away. \n\nOlder siblings are heros to the younger ones, and in your excitement for this new direction in your life, is it possible you\u2019ve missed noticing how profoundly it\u2019s bothering her that you\u2019ll be gone? \n\nBe the bigger sibling, let it pass, and let her talk if she needs to about things, just keep in mind it will take a while to rebuild the trust\n\nAs far as what you said, if it was me who had lashed out like that, I would apologize for it. No buts, no reasons why or justification why you said it. Just say something like \u201cthat thing I said about you being alone, it was really mean, and I didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Full stop, just don\u2019t even talk after that so you don\u2019t add a \u201cbut\u201d or anything there\n\nShe knows she\u2019s said hurtful things to you, so maybe she\u2019ll apologize too when she\u2019s ready, or maybe that\u2019s too painful, so maybe just going forward point it out to her so she knows that you do hurt when she does that\n\nWhen you\u2019re gone you may find yourself missing her too, although you\u2019ll be busy with studies and new experiences! So just maybe find a way now to tell her you care, and that you\u2019re sad about the part that means leaving her and the family? After things have settled a bit. and maybe talk with her about ways you can still keep in touch while you\u2019re away, or make plans for when you return", "ESH\n\nsounds like shes just being a teen, lol. and i mean, maybe she has resentment toward you for being mean to her in the past. i think you worded it way too harshly and i think your sisters becoming a mean girl, which she'll, most likely, grow out of.", "ESH. Just because she says something hurtful doesn\u2019t justify responding in kind. You\u2019re teenage siblings. You don\u2019t have to win every interaction. Your relationship will continue for decades. And sure you don\u2019t deserve being put down but that doesn\u2019t give you license to say horrible things either.", "ESH. You\u2019re both still kids and acting like kids. She was mean and you were mean back.", "Neither of you sound pleasant. It sounds like you both have issues and take it out on each other. You won't get the help that you need from Reddit. You need outside help, but not from strangers on the internet. Speak to your therapist. I assume you have one because of the ED edit. If you don't, seek one out. It sounds like your sister needs one too.\n\nI won't pass a judgement, but just some advice: you cannot control others, only yourself and your reactions. Do better, you deserve it.", "All this is normal sibling rivalry, especially at the ages you two are at. 15 is hard age. She's between a child, teenager and the verge of being an adult. You yourself are just becoming an adult. You'll look back on this in a few years and sigh over how silly it was.  \n\nShe's likely lashing out. You're leaving her to go to school. She's going to miss you and doesn't want to admit it to herself or you, and she's having a hard time. \n\nYou probably are as well, and don't realize it.  \n\nApologize because you love her, and you're both hurting. It will make you both feel better.", "Not really sure you're in the right subreddit because I don't think labeling people the \"asshole\" here is appropriate. You sound like two teenagers dealing with insecurities in the emotional, reactionary, and sometimes shitty ways that teenagers deal with them. \n\nSounds like your sister needs help getting at the root of her insecurities. She probably needs therapy.", "ESH\n\nYour sister sounds awful, but I can't imagine why you would expect her to like you after the way you've treated her.

You are both children struggling to find a way to relate to each other. Her comments were not kind, but it sounds like you have been unkind to her in the past.

I\u2019m gonna say NTA but you were pretty harsh. Word of advice from someone that has the same issue but is a bit older: don\u2019t try to be close to her. Don\u2019t listen to what she says. Don\u2019t give in to her games. She might change when she\u2019s older (bc we\u2019re all assholes when we are teens lol) and then you might have a really good relationship, but for now, there\u2019s nothing to be done. She clearly just wants to bring you down with her, since she doesn\u2019t sound like a very happy person.\n\nAlso, try not to explode like that. Instead, stop keeping the small things to yourself and reply with the same energy. You will get backlash from your family, but try to explain to your parents how you feel. Ultimately, don\u2019t mind them either. They aren\u2019t bad people, but they might (much like my folks) be a little off-put by the change in your behavior. But trust me, it\u2019s for the best. You don\u2019t have to fight, just give her enough push back so that you stop bottling everything. I did that for years and it fucks with your head, it\u2019s not good for you.\n\nOne more thing: enjoy the distance when you go to uni. She might need to miss you a bit before she\u2019s ready for an actual relationship.\n\nOverall, I understand you so deeply bc I find myself in the same position to this day.
