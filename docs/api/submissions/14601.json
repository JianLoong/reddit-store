First of all I want to get this straight: I love my sister, I'd give her a kidney in a heartbeat if she needed it. I just don't *like* her. I don't think we'd be friends if we weren't sisters.\n\nShe and I were very close when we were young and got along really well, however we drifted apart when I grew up. I wasn't always nice to her and vice versa. I didn't like it when she tried to hang out with me and my friends and I realise that she only did it to get close to me but at the time it was  annoying.\n\nLately, I've been trying to be nicer to her and improve our relationship as I will be leaving the country for university in July but she makes it incredibly hard to stay civil. She is incredibly mean to our mother, is disrespectful and also very catty. There have been several occasions where I caught her hanging out with someone only to talk badly about them to her friends afterwards. Also, when she asks to borrow my clothes and when I say yes, she comes into my room and claims she is \"drowning\" in them.\n\nYesterday, she cried because she realised that we are the same pant size and she doesn't want to be fat like me. We are both at a healthy weight for our height so I don't get where she got the fat comment from but whatever. This makes me feel like crap to be honest because I've really been trying to get along with her and feel like my efforts are in vain.\n\nAlso during dinner, she always tries to make my achievements seem like nothing. I do the IB and recently got accepted to a very prestigious university in the field that I want to study. During dinner last night, when I shared the news with my parents, she immediately said \"Wow, they must be taking anyone since your grades are really low and your CV is garbage.\"\n\nAnyways this comment made me furious and 12 years worth of resentment poured out of me. I yelled at her that she was a horrible person and that I hope she knows she will die alone and unhappy if she doesn't change. She cried and ran to her room and my parents told me that while I was right to be angry, I had no right to yell those things at my sister.\n\nI've been getting calls and messages from family members to apologise but I don't want to. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Obviously the 12 years of resentment is an exaggeration, we haven't been getting along since she was 13.\n\nCONTEXT: I have a history of struggling with food and am currently recovering from a restrictive ED. I have gained a healthy amount of weight which is why we are both at the same pant size.\n\nEDIT 2: English isn't my first language so I use the term \"grown up\" to mean \"older\"", "created_utc": 1681299300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jj8kg/aita_for_disliking_my_sister_and_telling_her_that/", "score": 2220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister was going for the jugular with those comments. Your parents should have stepped in and defended you.", "NTA tbh. She needed the wake up call on her bitchiness.

Maybe she can be civil if she sees you at Christmas break, or something.\n\nCongratulations on your college acceptance! You are off to a great start, your sister shouldn\u2019t have shit on it.\n\nAnd, yes, she will be alone and unhappy if she doesn\u2019t get a grip. (I think she is jealous of you. With you away, she might straighten up a little).  But-whatever. Sucks for her. NTA", "I do not think you are the AH at all here. When I was younger, maybe 8-14 yo my siblings would always tell me how difficult I was and that I was never going to find anyone and be alone. Siblings say things out of anger, pain, and frustration but they never really mean it. \n\nIf your sister truly made those comments about your weight and education - she is the supreme AH of the day. A lot of siblings go through fluctuations of being close and being distant. \n\nI think your sister may have some mental health concerns to address before becoming a better version of herself. Don\u2019t take it personal and just ride the wave to college. One day she will learn that you need to lead with kindness and until that day, life will be difficult for her.", "Clearly your sister isn't in your school's IB program. That curriculum is so hard that graduating with top grades from it gets you into the most prestigious universities in the world, *and* you walk in with most/all of your freshman year done. Some US universities even give you enough credits from IB to cover your sophomore year as well... with 'so-so' grades. Congratulations on your accomplishments!!\n\nBut maybe I'm being generous and your sister is perfectly aware of your academic achievements and just has a deep seated need to put you down. Which is worse.\n\nBut, you don't just have a sister problem, you have a parent problem. Your parents aren't helping her by saying that you need to use kinder words. Her behavior *is* going to isolate her as an adult, and it's their job to correct that behavior and/or figure out why she's just an inherently mean person. But they're protecting and enabling her, which allows her to hurt you and others.\n\nNTA.", "NTA she expected you not to clap back.

You may have been too rejecting, harsh and critical when she tried to hang out with you and your friends. Not blaming, merely pointing out that you might take a look at why she's so critical of you or why you've grown so far apart.\n\n\nYou're at a turning point now, and can begin to fix it. Sit down with your sister and your parents and CALMLY explain  her comments hurt you, that you feel like your interactions have become predominantly negative, and that you'd like to rebuild friendship with her for the few months you have left in the house. \n\n\nTake time to listen to her but commit to CALMLY pointing it out if/when she criticizes you in future (\"Sis, that's the kind of thing that I think is hurtful\"), and then CALMLY disengaging. \n\n\nPracticing this will help you in any upcoming roommate situations and to be a mature advocate of your boundaries. I wish you all the very best.", "ESH. I went through similar years with one of my sisters. We loved each other but we struggled hard to get along for more than a few minutes at a time. We were both teenage girls and focused on our own drama while trying to navigate the difficult teen years. She said some terrible things to me, I said some terrible things to her.\n\nAs the younger child I will tell you that your sister's crummy attitude is likely at least in part due to jealousy. You're older, doing well, moving ahead with your life and she probably feels left behind a bit, especially if you were close up until a few years ago.\n\nI know it stinks to be the one to feel like you always have to take the high road, but try to remember that in another few years you'll both be adults and your relationship will change again, hopefully for the better. My sister and I are good friends now, but it didn't start to happen until we were in our mid twenties.", "A very gentle ESH. She's 15. Do you think you were a perfect angel at 15? Heck, do you think you're perfect now?\n\nTeen years come with a lot of growing pains and a lot of words spoken in anger/jealousy/the heat of the moment that you'll (both) likely cringe about in your adulthood. It's part of the experience. Try to be more patient with your sister. Try to be more patient with yourself. Congratulations on your college acceptance :)", "ESH she\u2019s 15 and your both doing and saying horrible things. You both need to grow up", "ESH. You\u2019re only 17, are you any closer to not dying alone and unhappy? You\u2019re both acting your age, there\u2019s nothing more to it. Your feelings are valid, and quite justifiable by your description, but your actions are not. \n\nYour sister is 15. I\u2019m sure in some way, her (unjustifiable) actions of attempting to diminish your accomplishments, may even be out of a place of not wanting you to go. And that\u2019s one possibility, it\u2019s a twisted one, but perhaps there\u2019s a real lack of understanding here on both parts \u2014 because of a lack of proper communication. \n\nYou could just tell her how you feel about the things she says. You could tell her your intention is to be close before you go. Etc. But yelling at her, saying catty things back, is not going to accomplish anything but the opposite.", "Congrats on your success, that\u2019s awesome!\n\nYour sister sounds like she\u2019s hurting, to be treating you like this\n\nIt\u2019s normal for teens to rebel, and they say very hurtful things, so add that to you having this success and leaving her behind, that\u2019s huge for her. Your parents are probably very proud of you, which may make her feel a bit less-than too\n\nInstead of fighting, who not try just calling her out on any future mean comments - just say \u201cthat\u2019s hurtful\u201d and let it go - realize she\u2019s saying it to hurt you, probably because she feels bad about herself, or angry at you for leaving, or worried she\u2019s growing up too but won\u2019t be able to succeed like you, or scared she won\u2019t see you again when you\u2019re away. \n\nOlder siblings are heros to the younger ones, and in your excitement for this new direction in your life, is it possible you\u2019ve missed noticing how profoundly it\u2019s bothering her that you\u2019ll be gone? \n\nBe the bigger sibling, let it pass, and let her talk if she needs to about things, just keep in mind it will take a while to rebuild the trust\n\nAs far as what you said, if it was me who had lashed out like that, I would apologize for it. No buts, no reasons why or justification why you said it. Just say something like \u201cthat thing I said about you being alone, it was really mean, and I didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Full stop, just don\u2019t even talk after that so you don\u2019t add a \u201cbut\u201d or anything there\n\nShe knows she\u2019s said hurtful things to you, so maybe she\u2019ll apologize too when she\u2019s ready, or maybe that\u2019s too painful, so maybe just going forward point it out to her so she knows that you do hurt when she does that\n\nWhen you\u2019re gone you may find yourself missing her too, although you\u2019ll be busy with studies and new experiences! So just maybe find a way now to tell her you care, and that you\u2019re sad about the part that means leaving her and the family? After things have settled a bit. and maybe talk with her about ways you can still keep in touch while you\u2019re away, or make plans for when you return", "ESH\n\nsounds like shes just being a teen, lol. and i mean, maybe she has resentment toward you for being mean to her in the past. i think you worded it way too harshly and i think your sisters becoming a mean girl, which she'll, most likely, grow out of.", "ESH. Just because she says something hurtful doesn\u2019t justify responding in kind. You\u2019re teenage siblings. You don\u2019t have to win every interaction. Your relationship will continue for decades. And sure you don\u2019t deserve being put down but that doesn\u2019t give you license to say horrible things either.", "ESH.

If you don't, seek one out. It sounds like your sister needs one too.\n\nI won't pass a judgement, but just some advice: you cannot control others, only yourself and your reactions. Do better, you deserve it.", "All this is normal sibling rivalry, especially at the ages you two are at. 15 is hard age. She's between a child, teenager and the verge of being an adult. You yourself are just becoming an adult. You'll look back on this in a few years and sigh over how silly it was.  \n\nShe's likely lashing out. You're leaving her to go to school. She's going to miss you and doesn't want to admit it to herself or you, and she's having a hard time. \n\nYou probably are as well, and don't realize it.  \n\nApologize because you love her, and you're both hurting. It will make you both feel better.", "Not really sure you're in the right subreddit because I don't think labeling people the \"asshole\" here is appropriate.

She probably needs therapy.", "ESH\n\nYour sister sounds awful, but I can't imagine why you would expect her to like you after the way you've treated her.

You are both children struggling to find a way to relate to each other. Her comments were not kind, but it sounds like you have been unkind to her in the past.

Don\u2019t give in to her games. She might change when she\u2019s older (bc we\u2019re all assholes when we are teens lol) and then you might have a really good relationship, but for now, there\u2019s nothing to be done. She clearly just wants to bring you down with her, since she doesn\u2019t sound like a very happy person.\n\nAlso, try not to explode like that. Instead, stop keeping the small things to yourself and reply with the same energy. You will get backlash from your family, but try to explain to your parents how you feel.

It's a rough time.\n\nYou were mean to your sister when you were a bit younger. She's getting you back. In a few years none of this stuff will be important to either of you. Good on you for acting like an adult about it most of the time.\n\nIt's okay to be mad about how she is acting. It's okay to not like her right now. It's okay to be hurt by her insults. It's understandable that you lashed out when you had had enough of her nonsense. Now continue acting like an adult and apologize, like any mature adult would when they lost their cool.", "NTA.

Therapy works wonders as well, and it sounds like an intervention might be necessary here.", "NTA I had the same thing with my sister. We are 5 years apart.

I was entering high school at the time and she is 5 years older than me.\n\nI went through a period where my entitlement was something else and I was insufferable (come to find out due to my anxiety and just plain being a teenager). It's hard to hear but it's needed sometimes.\n\nI hope your relationship ends with time and you become close. I'm very close to my sister now. Also congrats on all your achievements and being able to go abroad to study!", "NTA. \n\nYou know the old saying, \u201cyou can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make them drink?\u201d.\n\nWell, you did your part. You met her halfway and made an effort and you were met with disdain, abuse and hostility. \n\nShe showed you exactly who she is, so believe her.\n\n\nETA congratulations on your prestigious acceptance! That\u2019s such a big accomplishmentment!!", "NTA. Your sister is clearly angry and jealous of you and lashing out to try to hurt you. It's fucked up that your parents are allowing her to talk to you like this in front of them without intervening, especially with regard to the weight comments knowing you're in recovery. Congratulations on both your recovery progress and your college acceptance. Hopefully your little sister grows out of this behavior.", "NTA\n\nWhy are your parents not parenting? There is no way I'd stand for those insulting and ignorant comments from my child. \n\nThere are clearly deep rooted issues here that your sister has, perhaps around her self-esteem. Is it that she hates herself? Or is depressed? Your parents should get her help as she seems have have mental health issues.", "NTA. She tried to ruin your joy and got told off.

She\u2019s a mean person, and even though your outburst was really bad, it justifies everything you\u2019ve been through. \n\nI just want to say, you\u2019re a level-headed, smart beautiful person, and I love that you know that. Here\u2019s some extra love from a stranger on the internet. I also have a sister two years younger than I am. We were friendly growing up, drifted apart during college, but are super close now.

She needs to change.", "NTA \nIf your sister knows about your history with an restrictive ED her trying to make you feel big by making these comments about your size and clothes is so SO VILE. \nIn general it sounds to me like your sister has a chip on her shoulder and feels inferior, therefor she tries to make you feel inferior to make herself feel better. \nHer jabs at your grades seems like she is upset that she doesn't have the same opportunity to study abroad so she tries to take that out on you. \nShe sounds like she need to do a LOT of interspection and work on herself to become a better person. \nI would not blame you at all for going NC with her. The comments she makes, especially about your body are just not healthy to be around.", "NTA- it\u2019s a really classic younger sibling tactic to deliberately antagonise someone and then strategically cry about it the moment they fire back. Parents are generally mugs who fall for it 95% of the time.", "God no NTA", "NTA. Honestly, I feel like I could have written this about me and my sister  from the types of arguments, putting down accomplishes, fat comments while struggling with an ED, etc. We are older now (30 and 26) and after some distance, life experience, and what not I can confidently say we are best friends. It just took time, maturity, and growth for us to both realize we didn't want to fight anymore, hashed things out, learned more about who the other person was as an adult and how we've changed from when we were kids, and forgave each other for everything that happened. I hope you guys can get to this point in the future too!", "NTA, but I would also mention: you are 17 and your sister is 15, neither of you are grown yet. Your sister sounds like a pretty typical insecure teenager, but her comments were unnecessarily mean and you responded in a way that was appropriate for a hurry teenager. You yourself mention that you were pretty cruel and exclusionary to your sister when you were her age. You weren't wrong for what you said, but give her a little bit of grace, and remember that when you were her age you were putting her through much of the same.", "NTA: your sister is a jealous git, and you are right, her future is bleak with an attitude like that.  Best to just move on like you want to do.  The one that owes the apology is your sister.", "NTA - she got put in her place.  She reacted like that because she dished more than she could take.  She clearly has some insecurities and needs to deal with them in a better way.  She may also be dealing with some mental health challenges as she goes through her teen years.  It\u2019s not your job to be her punching bag and just \u201cfeel angry\u201d without protecting yourself.\n\nI\u2019m surprised this didn\u2019t happen earlier.  My older sister and I had some pretty dramatic fights growing up.  Things mellowed out completely when she went to college and I got older.  \n\nYour sister owes you an apology.  It sounds like your parents coddle her when they should be addressing her behavioral and emotional issues.\n\nYou do not owe her an apology - full stop.  She is a bully, she crossed a line, and she got what the real world is going to give her if she doesn\u2019t shape up.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re leaving the country for school.  Distance is probably going to be good for everyone.", "NTA I don't see how what you said is any worse than what she said. Relationships are reciprocal and both parties set the tone.", "NTA and as an older sister myself, I really didn't like my younger sister when she was a teenager. A lot of changes can happen in the next few years. So go enjoy college. Your sister will probably grow out of this.", "NTA. So, she learned? Sometimes people clap back. Your words were harsh, certainly. But, how much of her crud are you supposed to just shrug off and pretend isn't a problem? \n\nWhy apologize when you don't feel remorseful?

Is that apology working for you because I'm good with it.\"", "NTA.   \n\n\nSpeaking as the little sister (who was bullied by my older siblings) these relationships (especially among same sex siblings) often get volatile around this age.

It's a think that happens as we get older.", "NTA. And honestly you don\u2019t even need to preface this with \u201cI love my sister\u201d. If somebody treats you like literal shit, like your sister, you\u2019re not obligated to love them. Also, your parents should have defended you, they should see through your sister\u2019s manipulations- is she always the victim? Why do your parents put up with her disrespect of everyone?

I would have stifled her. She needs therapy. Tell your parents you will not come back to visit till they get her under control. I find it disgusting that they had the nerve to tell you that you shouldn't talk to your sister like that but it was OK for her to say what she did.", ">CONTEXT: I have a history of struggling with food and am currently recovering from a restrictive ED. I have gained a healthy amount of weight which is why we are both at the same pant size.\n\nI don't understand. So you wore a smaller size than your sister before? Why was she commenting that she's \"drowning\" in them and that she doesn't want \"to be fat\" if you were smaller and her weight didn't change?", "Op NTA\n\n Parents and sister are.  The parents were enabling her and never told her to stop and his sister for well everything else", "NTA\n\nBut, have you ever actually apologized to your sister for pushing her away when you were younger? This is the first step to repairing your relationship. (It's also likely the hardest because, frankly, she may not be willing to accept your apology. You have to accept either response and move forward as if she accepted in your behavior toward her.)\n\nFor your mental health, I would stop letting her borrow your clothes. If your sister teased you about having green hair (assuming you don't dye it green) would that upset you or would you just wonder WTF is going on in her head? You likely wouldn't get upset because you know it's not true. When she, or anyone else for that matter, says something about you, rather than reacting, stop and think about it. Is it false? If so, who cares. You know it's not true. Is it true? If so, why does it bother you? Is it because it's a habit you need to change or is it something you cannot change? Or, is it something that doesn't bother you and isn't harming you?

The turn of phrase \"2 wrongs don't make a right\" exists for a reason. To me, this reads like typical *teenage* siblings. Sibling rivalry/sibling jealousy mixed with teenage hormones and trying to figure out who you are. Feeding it never helps. Don't escalate things, and just keep trying after you move, the distance may change things a lot. \n\nSide to add: your parents are TA here. They aren't parenting.

And what could have been done to stop it.", "I completely agree. I think there are two parts to this. One part of this is that at this age her sister is starting to want to pull away from their family and becoming more friend/found-family focused, so there's a bit of natural biology they're both fighting against.\n\nBut I think you hit the second part spot on, I also think that younger sister is subconsciously trying to push the older sister away on purpose in preparation for her leaving. That younger sister feels hurt and abandoned by older sister and so she's punishing her so that when she (OP) leaves she (little sis) will hurt less (\"*She didn't leave me, I pushed her away.*\") It's a very immature way of thinking which honestly matches the age range.\n\nI agree with you about sitting down and explaining how her comments hurt her (OP) but also specifically talking about how just because she's leaving doesn't mean that she doesn't love her or won't miss her too (little sis), and that she would really like you said spend as much of their remaining time together hanging out and talk about how they can keep in touch once she has moved away. *\"I don't know what I did to hurt you or make you feel this way. I wish I knew so I could apologize appropriately.

Its pretty easy to not be a bitch. Being emotional is one thing, being mean is completely different.", "Yup. It's not that uncommon to grow apart while you're in different stages of life then come back together when you've both matured a bit. Little sister suffered while the older one went through it, now older one is getting the same while younger one goes through that phase. Hopefully some distance and more maturity will bring them back together in another few years.", "One is doing a sustained campaign of meanness against someone who just recovered from a long term illness, the other one fired back a total of once after getting defended by nobody. Definitely equivalent! /s", "Agreed. People are really going for the jugular when this girl is FIFTEEN.

That doesn't mean this girl is going to grow up to be a monster of a person.", "I had a similar issue with my brother growing up. He was younger and wanted to hang out with me and my friends. I didn\u2019t want him there. When I became an adult I felt like shit for how I treated him and apologized. He was very hateful to me for a long time and said some things that made me cry.

The older sibling not only had all the attention when she was unwell,  she also dismissed her younger sister wanting to be friends for a long time. The older sister needs to understand her younger sister has been pushed to the corner in the family dynamics for a long time and her behaviour is the result of this. Wanting to be friends cause you're leaving home is a lame excuse to wanting to become close & the younger sister has seen through this. \nThe OP needs to make sure she contacts her younger sister at least every week, to let her know she cares for her. Why bother create further division & permanent conflict with LC or NC? \nEventually the younger sister will realise the OP cares about her. Obviously the younger sister needs help grappling with her anger at how she's been treated within the family dynamics all these years. She's lashing out her hurt so she needs some form of therapy. Not to be dumped aside by those who've caused the problems (through no fault of their own).", "What lesson do you teach the child who defends themselves if they never see their bully reprimanded but are reprimanded for reacting negatively to their bully?\n\nThis is happening at the family dinner table, where OP should have every expectation of being able to eat in a safe and supportive environment.

Again, part of the experience. Between all the 'fun' things happening socially, the pressures at school and home, and, of course, the havoc being wrought on your body by hormones, I think lashing out every now and then is to be expected. It's not *okay*. If appropriate parenting is implemented, it can be an excellent springboard for personal growth and development.
