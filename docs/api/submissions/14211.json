He is quite reserved. He doesn't hide the fact that he's gay but doesn't go around telling everyone either. I live in a different city as my sister's family. \n\nMy BIL (32M) had to come here for work purposes, and asked if he could stay at our apartment for 5 days. I discussed this with austin and he said he had no issue with it, and that my bil could stay in the spare room. Everything was fine for the first two days, no issues.\n\n On the third day, we were all having dinner together. Everything was going fine. Austin and BIL were joking around with each other, mostly teasing and he decides to comment on his dressing style, and says how he dresses like a 'fag'. \n\nObviously, Austin was offended and asked my BIL what he means by that. My BIL probably thought he was offended at the fact that my bil \"accused him\" of being gay, so he laughs and says 'no offense, you are cool. I did not mean to insult you. You just dress like a slut\". \n\nAt this point, i was starting to get irritated and before Austin could reply, i intervened and said that he cannot talk like that to Austin. He got super defensive and was explaining how 'its a joke' and asked something along the lines of \"why am i getting super defensive? is he actually gay or something?\" and laughed right after, like it was a joke. \n\nI got super mad and was about to shout at him, when Austin confirmed yes, he was gay. My BIL was shocked and replied with ofcourse you dress like a f*g, you are one. This was the final straw, i screamed at him. \n\nIt quickly escalated to the point that we all were just screaming. I put an end to it by saying that if he feels like he can disrespect my roommate and continue disrespecting him, he can't fucking live here and he has to get out. now. he tried protesting but this wasn't up for debate, and he soon left. \n\nI apologized to Austin a million times for my BIL's behaviour, cause quite frankly, he didn't deserve it. Thankfully, Austin forgave me.\n\n Later, my sister calls me and screams at me, and calls me an AH for kicking my BIL out. I tried explaining to her that it's his fault and she sides with him and says 'it was a joke, get over it.\" She also says how i shouldn't ruin my relationship with my BIL because of a person I've known for 2 years. She says some bs about how blood is thicker than water blah blah. She also says she would cut contact with me, if i don't apologize to him. I get frustrated, refuse to do so and hang up. \n\nI, quite honestly, can't believe this. I always thought my BIL was cool and i liked him, and even thought that my sister found a great guy. We were close, and i enjoyed his company. I never thought it would turn out like this. Most of my family says i should just apologize for the sake of family and if i don't, i'm being an AH for tearing the family apart over some boy.

Yes, this is a shitty thing to have to do, but it prevents these kinds of situations. \n\nFor example, I have a very close friend without a body part. I have noticed that it is very awkward for him to be stared at. It is shitty to have to do this. I KNOW. But if I introduce my friend to a new group I usually say something to the effect that my friend is different in some way, he should be respected, and not stared at. This avoids all confrontation and my friend doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable either. In this case most people were just curious or shocked when they noticed, but I could tell it really bothered my friend and that made me feel bad for him. I don\u2019t want him to be upset. \n\nI\u2019m not saying being gay is the same, but if you had any previous information about your brother in law being homophobic, maybe you could have mentioned that your roommate is gay and you will not tolerate disrespect to him since it is his house as well. That would have been a great thing to do beforehand. Now, it is a little too late. So what you did is totally acceptable. If you didn\u2019t stand up for your roommate that would have made you a jerk as well.", "NTA You're not 'tearing the family apart', he is. How about he apologise to Austin for making such a badly conceived 'joke' in his own home and then doubling down on it?

I am sorry to learn my family thinks his behavior is okay because now he says it was a joke.

Absolutely NTA. Shine the light on bigots.", "\"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\" is the actual saying.

I made a mistake in the og post, but it's actually my sister and not my SIL who called me, which was a shock in itself, because she was fully supportive of me when i came out as bi. I thought of both of them as great people and even role models, which makes this hurt even more.", "I believe that its OP's sister, not SIL.", "Yeah blood is thicker than water, but she will drop contact with sister because BIL got offended.\n\nAlso BIL is not same blood.\n\nYou did good.", "It\u2019s also great as they forget the full phrase: blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.", "That\u2019s not the saying.
