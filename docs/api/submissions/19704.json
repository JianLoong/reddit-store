{"id": 19704, "submission_id": "149hzus", "title": "AITA for replacing my mother's coffee beans with cocoa krispies?", "selftext": "So my (16) mom (45) drinks coffee pretty much every day, not even joking. She has several bags of coffee beans and makes them every day. Sometimes she makes coffee in advance for up coming days. I've told her that it's not good to drink coffee every day, but she insists that it's fine.\n\nThe other day I decided to play a small joke on her. She always uses one bag of coffee beans until she runs out, then she swaps it for another one. I took an empty bag and filled it with a bag of my cocoa krispies, then swapped it with the bag of coffee beans she had prepared. I didn't think she'd actually fall for it or anything, since the cereal wouldn't weigh the same as the beans. But she actually almost made coffee with it!\n\nWhen she realized that it wasn't coffee beans she got mad and asked who did this, since sometimes my brother would play a prank on her too. I told her I did, and that I put the actual bag of beans where she always stores them. I didn't think she'd get that mad, but she actually grounded me for the rest of the day.\n\nIt's now two days later and she's still mad. My dad insists that it's just the way she is and it's true because she does get mad easily, but I'm starting to feel bad because she keeps bringing it up. Am I in the wrong?\n\n\nQuick edit: So I just went up to her again to apologize again, and she apologized first. She told me that she wasn't mad at me, she had lashed out because she had an argument with my grandfather over something pretty serious, she didn't say what exactly though. Then she lashed out at me and later at my dad over something he said. She told me she thought my prank was funny and that she'd have to get me back sometime. So I guess this worked out alright in the end.", "created_utc": 1686773946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149hzus/aita_for_replacing_my_mothers_coffee_beans_with/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
