I was spending a few days on a trip in a cabin with a couple of friends. One of them I am acquainted with but don't know too well. I just know that he doesn't eat meat and he claims to be vegan. I don't care if he is vegan, people can eat how they want. I think his \"veganism\" comes from him never trying foods. He eats nothing but junk food and doesn't like meat or eggs or drinking milk because it is from an animal and the texture is gross to him. Again, not my problem, his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe eats doritos and chips constantly. Lots of ramen noodles and mac n cheese. I don't think I've seen him eat a vegetable. I've never really seen his eating habits before this trip. First night we were deciding what to eat. A friend suggested pizza and he agreed. I said(keeping him in mind) I said we should make sure they have options with vegan cheese and meatless sauce. He was like \"what? cheese is okay to eat. It's not meat.\" I told him cheese is made from milk and he looked sick. He went on his phone and searched it up and was very upset. I thought this was common knowledge. He said that he loves pizza and pretty much lives off pizza. And that he eats tons of mac n cheese. I guess we were just assuming he had the vegan thing handled and ate vegan mac or that cheap Krafts \"cheese\" is not even real cheese so it didn't matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day we were ordering food. We were telling our order to one person and they'd go out and pick it up. He was asking for a sandwich with just vegan cheese, onions, and mayo and a side of fries. I said to make sure that they have vegan mayo there(big mistake) He was upset and asked why can't he eat mayo. I said mayo is made with eggs and he got really pissed at me and said I am ruining all the good food for him. At this point I just stopped keeping him in mind. He made some other questionable orders of things with animal product and I just didn't bring it up. He says I ruined food for him because he puts cheese and mayo on most things he eats. He called me an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't care what the guy eats. I don't care if he claims to be vegan and eats steak every day. I was just keeping him in mind.

He should know all of this being \"vegan.\" You should have pointed out the rest of the questionable things he had. Just to make sure you were thorough in \"ruining\" all his food.", "NTA. Sounds like you were looking out for his diet restrictions. It's not your fault he didn't really have any idea what he was eating.", "NTA - you were being accommodating to what he said was his lifestyle choice. It\u2019s not your fault he hadn\u2019t researched what actual food is not allowed on a vegan diet.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe guy sounds really immature and uneducated about food basics.  Basically, hiding his toddler palate behind a socially acceptable excuse only to be caught with his proverbial pants down.", "NTA - \u201cSometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed.\u201d You were just the messenger of facts.", "Nta\n\nI'm not vegan but I have friends who have verious allergies and dietary requirements for various reasons.\n\n\nI don't care what they eat. But I want to make sure they *know* what they're eating", "NTA. He was very ignorant and uninformed. You were just trying to help and save him from himself. Him saying you were ruining food for him just means he'd rather go on in blissful ignorance, rather than\u00a0normal people who would appreciate you letting them know", "Nta, what is his thought process because even I know that's not vegan unless the product strictly say vegan on it or vegan friendly and I'm not vegan myself, seriously I hope he doesn't cook for other people who are vegan.", "Hahaha NTA. You meant well and were very considerate of his dietary preferences. How should you have known he was and also preferred to stay that ignorant?", "NTA. If dude actually cares about eating vegan, this should be welcome knowledge (and it\u2019s ridiculous he didn\u2019t know it already). His positioning it like you\u2019re ruining his favorite foods by telling him they aren\u2019t vegan is laughable.", "Worse news, if he's using the flavor packet in instant ramen, that's not vegan, either. NTA, you were just trying to look out for him.", "NTA; this is hilarious", "NTA. He's not vegan, he's a junkaholic.", "NTA. It's a lil weird he didn't know cheese is a dairy product, but not everyone realizes mayo is an emulsion of egg and oil. It sounds to me like you originally broached the cheese thing in a very polite and helpful way (reminding your nonvegan friends that you should make sure an actually vegan option is available) and it was also helpful to remind him to ask for vegan mayo. It's probably wise to avoid getting suckered into any more conversations about food and veganism with this guy. At this point, you've said everything that needs saying, and he's probably gotten the point that if he wants to eat vegan, he needs to do his due diligence and check that things are actually vegan. If he tries to argue with you about this again, something polite and deescalating like, \"I don't want to cause further offense, so I'd rather talk about \\[sports/the weather/somebody's new cat\\]\" might work.", "HAHAHA NTA this guy is a child you should keep correcting him on what\u2019s vegan", "NTA-\n\nThis guys is just using being Vegan as a way to pretend he eats healthy.\n\nIf he was really vegan he would know everything with animal products and he would have at least some vegetables in his diet. \n\nPlus if he claims to be Vegan but then gets mad when you are helping him to do just that... he is just kinda dumb.", "NTA - this guy isn't vegan.

Consideration for someone's dietary restrictions and habits when choosing a restaurant is generally polite, provided that they are not restrictive of others.\n\nThis reminds me, a bit about vegetarians who eat fish, not because they choose to be pescatarian, but because they are coming from traditions (e.g., Catholic, Ashkenazi Jew) where fish does not count as \"meat\" for religious purposes.  \n\nGenerally, if someone uses terms like vegetarian or vegan, I'll ask what that means for them.  It's easier than assuming they use a particular definition of those terms. \n\nBut if you asked, and he said he avoided dairy and meat, then considering those options when choosing a restaurant, and discussing them in that context, is entirely appropriate.", "What a lil dummy \ud83d\ude02 what country are you in?", "NTA dudes just a fussy confused vegetarian", "NTA\n\nBut instead of keeping him in mind I would have laughed or at least smile condescendingly and say nothing\n\nThis guy is vegan only on paper, I don't know why he even make a fuss about it", "NTA - but for his sake I hope this is an elaborate prank or else he is the most clueless person on Earth", "NTA and most Doritos also have milk in them.", "NTA.\n\nI mean the education system failed him greatly. If he wants to eat cheese and mayo, there's nothing wrong with that. He would just be a vegetarian, not a vegan. You didn't ruin it for him. He found out what most people know and chose to remain a vegan. It's not your fault reality exists.", "NTA. \nHe's gotta walk the walk if he's gonna screech and holler about his so called vegan diet. \n\nI'd be batting anything not vegan out of his hands before he can get it to his yap all weekend lol. \n\nCAN'T HAVE THAT!

What did he think the cows and the jugs of milk are for? Some sort of scenic rural backdrop for some vegetables?", "Hmm I don't think you're TA but if your guess are right about why he's vegan it might be less about ethics and such and more about textures or compulsions\n\neg my partner has OCD and if I say too much about where food comes from or the process of cooking something they often can't eat it that day anymore, even if they wanted to or want to another day\n\nIt sounds like he may have a similar issue, that the knowing makes it inedible to him and so he learns as little as possible about processed foods for that reason\n\nNo way to know if that's true in this case but if you see that friend again you should ask him if he'd prefer not to know about other foods\n\nFwiw tho I am morbidly curious what other foods he ate with animal products and I am sure others are too", "NTA I accidently did the same thing with a vegan coworker who regularly ate jello.

He could have called himself \"lacto-ovo-vegetarian\" with complete accuracy, and it would reflect his decision not to eat meat, but to eat dairy and eggs. \n\nVegetarian diets have a lot of variations, e.g., even quite strict Hindu vegetarians are likely to eat dairy of all sorts, but not eggs, fish or meat.
