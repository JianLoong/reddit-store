I don't care if he is vegan, people can eat how they want. I think his \"veganism\" comes from him never trying foods. He eats nothing but junk food and doesn't like meat or eggs or drinking milk because it is from an animal and the texture is gross to him. Again, not my problem, his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe eats doritos and chips constantly. Lots of ramen noodles and mac n cheese. I don't think I've seen him eat a vegetable. I've never really seen his eating habits before this trip. First night we were deciding what to eat. A friend suggested pizza and he agreed. I said(keeping him in mind) I said we should make sure they have options with vegan cheese and meatless sauce. He was like \"what? cheese is okay to eat. It's not meat.\" I told him cheese is made from milk and he looked sick. He went on his phone and searched it up and was very upset. I thought this was common knowledge. He said that he loves pizza and pretty much lives off pizza. And that he eats tons of mac n cheese. I guess we were just assuming he had the vegan thing handled and ate vegan mac or that cheap Krafts \"cheese\" is not even real cheese so it didn't matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day we were ordering food. We were telling our order to one person and they'd go out and pick it up. He was asking for a sandwich with just vegan cheese, onions, and mayo and a side of fries. I said to make sure that they have vegan mayo there(big mistake) He was upset and asked why can't he eat mayo. I said mayo is made with eggs and he got really pissed at me and said I am ruining all the good food for him. At this point I just stopped keeping him in mind. He made some other questionable orders of things with animal product and I just didn't bring it up. He says I ruined food for him because he puts cheese and mayo on most things he eats. He called me an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't care what the guy eats. I don't care if he claims to be vegan and eats steak every day. I was just keeping him in mind.
