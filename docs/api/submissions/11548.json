It was a MacBook pro that she had bought for around $1300, and it was starting to show it's age and having charging/ battery problems. She mentioned a couple times to me she was thinking of buying a new one. \n\nShe had a friend from class over for some drinks, and the girl ended up spilling a can of soda all over her keyboard and completely frying the whole thing. She took it to apple and they told her it was unrecoverable. My girlfriend lost pretty  much everything; schoolwork, online books, etc. The girl felt horrible and told her she would buy her a new one.\n\nI was talking to my girlfriend, and she said she felt bad about making the girl buy her one because she's super kind but not very well off financially. I told her that it's up to her but that she (gf) was the one out a laptop and all her assignments at the end of the day, and what would she do if the roles were reversed and she had wrecked this girl's laptop. My gf messaged the girl and asked her what she seemed fair, and the girl said that she would do whatever she wanted but if it was around $1000 she couldn't pay her back right away since she didn't have the money.\n\nWe were talking about laptops and my gf said she didn't want to spend too much and was looking for the best deal. We looked around a bit, saw some deals she seemed interested in and yesterday she went out to buy one. She called me at the end of the day and told me that she ended up spending $1900 on a brand new one and was going to ask the girl to pay $1500 towards it. My first response was \"woah, that's alot of money,\" and my girlfriend asked what I meant by that. I told her I thought she was going to try to find one on sale and that asking for that amount of money might affect their friendship, but she told me she wanted to buy brand new since she was going to keep it for a while and that if this girl didn't want to pay that she wasn't a friend she'd want to have, and that now she wasn't sure how much she should ask since I supported her getting it paid for before she bought it. I told her it was up to her how much she wanted to ask but she said she doesn't know what to do now.\n\nShe got upset at me for my answer and not supporting her, and has been kind of cold since. She has apparently talked to her friends and they say this girl should pay for the entire thing and that I should support her fully on it. I talked to my parents about it and they said that she seems like she's trying to get a whole new replacement for a broken down laptop and that it is alot of money to ask. I believe I may be the asshole by not supporting on her decision, but I didn't think she'd go out and spend that much.

The fact that she claims to have lost her online books because of this is just a bit funny( online books ore online....)\n\nI would say it's a red flag, as it shows that she will try to take advantage of people close to her.", "As the saying goes, when they show you who\nthey are, believe them.\n\nGF has shown you a lack of character, iffy ethics and a streak of opportunism.

If you had insurance on the laptop, they would pay to either repair or replace the laptop for one of similar value.\n\nIf your gf's laptop was 5 years old, it's not remotely reasonable to ask the girl to pay the full price of a **new** laptop.  Particularly if the girl really can't afford it.  What I would do is look up the current value of the exact laptop that was destroyed.  That is the cost the girl should pay towards the new laptop.\n\nApple laptops tend to hold their value well, so she'd still owe a good chunk towards a new one.", "NTA. Your gf is an A. She\u2019s only owed the replacement value of a 5 year old MacBook Pro. Not a new one and not an upgrade.\n\nLooks like 5 year old MacBook Pros are only worth between $450-800ish\n\nAll of her friends are As as well", "NTA\n\nIts absurd that your girlfriend and her friends think the other friend should be buying a brand new full priced MacBook because they accidentally spilled a can of soda on the keyboard. \n\nThe MacBook wasn't worth nearly $1500 at the time of the incident.", "NTA, your girlfriend is though. Hope you can see the \ud83d\udea9here. She\u2019s taking advantage of someone. That laptop was likely only worth a couple hundred, and she was looking to get a new one. Asking this girl to pay MORE than the ruined laptop was brand new is absolutely scamming her. She should be asking for no more than the value of the laptop at the time it was ruined. Figure out what that is and ask the friend to repay that amount only. Then I\u2019d run from this relationship without looking back.", "NTA your girlfriend is excessive. It sucks she lost her data, but thats really on her for not saving it in the cloud. But in no way can a 1300 dollars laptop be 1500 dollars worth 5 years later.

However it seems that she's more upset that you feel that friend shouldn't be on the hook for **more than** the purchase price of the original laptop so For that I'll say you're NTA.", "NTA your girl is out of order asking for that amount.

Your girlfriend is being unreasonable.", "NTA it's unreasonable to expect the girl to pay for the accident in the first place, let alone full value for a brand new (sounds like nicer) laptop. It definitely sounds like she's trying to get as much out of the deal as possible and that's a pretty shitty 180 to take since she's the one who pointed off the girl is not well-off financially.", "NTA\n\nThe five plus year old Mac would be using Intel CPUs which are old and won\u2019t receive OS version upgrades. That laptop was at the most worth $500 and I think it would be less especially being the CPU change. There\u2019s no way she should be asking for $1500. She probably doesn\u2019t even need a MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air would suffice.", "NTA\n\nIf I\u2019d broken a friend\u2019s laptop and caused them to lose their data, I\u2019d want to pay them back more than I legally owed them, to make up somewhat for the hassle.  Losing a working laptop and your data is way more trouble than the replacement value of a five year old laptop.\n\nThis friend seems to have felt the same way.  Politely hinting at a cap of $1000 was more than generous.  In your girlfriend\u2019s position, I\u2019d work to find a way to stay a hundred or two under that or mix in some of my own money if I wanted more.\n\nAsking for 50% more would absolutely be an asshole move.  $1000 is likely about double what she legally owes your girlfriend in the first place.", "I agree with your parents NTA", "NTA  \n\nYour girlfriend is trying to take advantage of the situation and have the friend pay for a brand new device when she should ask only for the value the old one had at the time it got destroyed.

At MOST she should ask for a few hundred dollars from her friend and put that towards any laptop she wants to buy. In no circumstance is it ok to ask for more than the original price of the laptop, and honestly she should even ask for that, it should be the current value of the broken item.

IF she were to contribute to it she would pay the depreciated value, which is likely not a whole lot. Given how it was an accident and your gf had friends over for drinks and did not put the laptop away, your gf still bares plenty of responsibility if not all, pending how the drink got spilled. \n\nYour gf also didnt seem to ask your opinion - so maybe tone down the judgment as well.\n\nEdit - everyone trying to get the person who spilled the soda to pay full price is an AH.", "NTA. Anything more than about $750-800 and she's taking advantage of her friend.", "Anyone else wondering if the GF set this whole thing up on purpose?\n\nEveryone I know is extremely cautious about keeping laptops away from drinks or anything else that could damage it. I have a REALLY hard time believing someone would be dumb enough to leave a laptop out around drinks AND drunk people.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious if she did this on purpose to have someone ruin her laptop and owe her a new one.", ">My girlfriend had her old laptop for about 5 years.

If she was already planning on a replacement for an expensive laptop, that replacement was most likely also going to be expensive. She factored that in when she was concerned about how much to ask the friend for due to her financial situation; you didn't. \n\nWhat she blames you for is influencing her not to do what she truly should have done (prioritize the friendship and ability to pay over money she didn't need) and then not understanding either the role your opinion/support for payment played or why she did what she did. \n\nShe was almost certainly looking at sales and cheaper options to make things easier for the friend but ultimately ended up going with what she would have bought herself had the friend not been involved. Like she said, it's a longterm purchase and apple products are known for planned obsolescence.\n\nThe correct solution is to look at used laptops in similar working order to the one she lost and have the friend pay based on that because it was clearly an accident.
