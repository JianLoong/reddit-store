She took it to apple and they told her it was unrecoverable. My girlfriend lost pretty  much everything; schoolwork, online books, etc. The girl felt horrible and told her she would buy her a new one.\n\nI was talking to my girlfriend, and she said she felt bad about making the girl buy her one because she's super kind but not very well off financially. I told her that it's up to her but that she (gf) was the one out a laptop and all her assignments at the end of the day, and what would she do if the roles were reversed and she had wrecked this girl's laptop. My gf messaged the girl and asked her what she seemed fair, and the girl said that she would do whatever she wanted but if it was around $1000 she couldn't pay her back right away since she didn't have the money.\n\nWe were talking about laptops and my gf said she didn't want to spend too much and was looking for the best deal. We looked around a bit, saw some deals she seemed interested in and yesterday she went out to buy one. She called me at the end of the day and told me that she ended up spending $1900 on a brand new one and was going to ask the girl to pay $1500 towards it. My first response was \"woah, that's alot of money,\" and my girlfriend asked what I meant by that. I told her I thought she was going to try to find one on sale and that asking for that amount of money might affect their friendship, but she told me she wanted to buy brand new since she was going to keep it for a while and that if this girl didn't want to pay that she wasn't a friend she'd want to have, and that now she wasn't sure how much she should ask since I supported her getting it paid for before she bought it. I told her it was up to her how much she wanted to ask but she said she doesn't know what to do now.\n\nShe got upset at me for my answer and not supporting her, and has been kind of cold since. She has apparently talked to her friends and they say this girl should pay for the entire thing and that I should support her fully on it. I talked to my parents about it and they said that she seems like she's trying to get a whole new replacement for a broken down laptop and that it is alot of money to ask.

If she was already planning on a replacement for an expensive laptop, that replacement was most likely also going to be expensive. She factored that in when she was concerned about how much to ask the friend for due to her financial situation; you didn't. \n\nWhat she blames you for is influencing her not to do what she truly should have done (prioritize the friendship and ability to pay over money she didn't need) and then not understanding either the role your opinion/support for payment played or why she did what she did. \n\nShe was almost certainly looking at sales and cheaper options to make things easier for the friend but ultimately ended up going with what she would have bought herself had the friend not been involved. Like she said, it's a longterm purchase and apple products are known for planned obsolescence.\n\nThe correct solution is to look at used laptops in similar working order to the one she lost and have the friend pay based on that because it was clearly an accident.

She can do what she wants, but she\u2019s definitely in the wrong here, and you\u2019re NTA for telling her so.", "Friend did not break a $1900 computer.  She broke a five  year old, failing computer, that probably would not sell for much, if anything.  If OP's girlfriend took the girl to court, OP's GF would only recover the worth of her old computer, not a new one.  GF's the AH here for overcharging.", "NTA but tell your gf she will soon lose a friend if she keeps that up. Her laptop isn't worth that much. She knows that but is trying to take advantage of her friend. I hope somebody is on the side of her friend and can tell her that the laptop is 5 yrs old.", "Friend doesn't owe entire cost only the depreciated value.", "I think there is just way too many people weighing in on this situation. It\u2019s between the GF and that friend. OP, the other friends, and OP\u2019s parent all need to take a back seat. The GF is beyond crazy for asking that much for a five year old laptop but that\u2019s on her.", "If someone drops your iPhone 6, they shouldn't be expected to replace it with an iPhone 12. Gf is absolutely TA for trying to get a brand new MacBook Pro to replace a 5 yo device with problems (that she already was planning to replace) on her \"friend's \" dime.", "$1500 is pretty egregious. NTA.", "Too much people weighing in? You do know this is Reddit right? Where the ONLY purpose is getting an answer?", "I had the thought of \"purpose\" too. <<*She had a friend from class over for some drinks*\\>>  \nIt is possible that she felt that Friend would be more willing to \"pay\" than other friends.  I do agree-a richer friend would be good idea.\n\nBut I only use capped drinks near computer, so I wouldn't be allowing someone an open soda by my computer.", "They should Amazon search for the broken item and the friend should pay her how much the item is currently going for used. Boom. Easy.", "If it was on or in standby mode it definitely could have broken it, and apple computers generally aren't that repairable.", "Especially considering she paid $1300 for it new. That's just being exploitative.", "No she shouldn\u2019t lol she didn\u2019t break a 1300 dollar laptop she broke a five-year-old laptop that was 1300 new.", "No, they said she didn't break a \"new laptop\" so shouldn't have to \"pay for one.\" -- \"one\" being a new laptop.", "NTA.  Your gf should, at most, get about half of the cost of her old laptop ($650).  Anything more is really taking advantage, IMO.", "NTA Your gf should look at how much someone would have paid for her old laptop if it hadn\u2019t been damaged and that is what the girl should owe her. Your gf is being ridiculous and I\u2019m a girl so I know how easy it is for us to get ridiculous lol. Good luck:)", "I have a 2017 MacBook Air and the trade in value is only $125 because they don\u2019t make them using those chips anymore. Maybe the resale value is more but that\u2019s all your gf\u2019s friend owes- the price of a 5 year old MacBook Pro. Not the cost of a new one and certainly not a $1500 MacBook Pro", "Nta but your gf is", "NTA\n\nSounds like your girlfriend started to see $$$ and ways to take advantage of her friend's guilt pretty name fast.  From 'she's not well off financially ' to 'fuck it, 1900' in thirty seconds.\n\nWhile it's between the friend and her, it should be current value on trade-in or something similar - which actually isn't much.  Mine is 7 years old and per the 'apple calculator' as I think about getting a new one, is worth 55$ in trade in- so I will probably resell for a bit more than that after getting it wiped once I cobble together money for a new one.  Her friend shouldn't be guilted into more than a hundred or so, if your girlfriend wants to keep her friend, that is.", "NTA and your GF is the one not being a very good friend because she\u2019s taking advantage of the situation. She already knew she wanted a new laptop and she is using the opportunity to get something nicer than she normally would have. The friend owes the current value of the old laptop. If the friend wants to be generous and pay her for a brand new laptop then she needs to get something of equivalent current value like an old discount model. If I crash your 5 year old Kia, you can\u2019t expect me to pay for your Mercedes as a replacement. And learn to back everything up. She could have easily spilled the drink herself.", "NTA. Even her saying she doesn't want the most expensive one and vet a good deal, wtf kind of laptop would you buy for 1900 then? And the friend broke the old laptop, that has nothing to do with the new one. Im an avid gamer, and even then, i wouldn't pay 1900 for a laptop. Not even for the best graphics and running system. Wtf.", "NTA. If your gf was to take this other girl to court they would only give her the value of what her old laptop was worth. Tell her to stop being greedy", "NTA - She had a laptop that was nearing end of life, which she would have needed to replace soon anyway.  Expecting her friend to pay for a brand new upgraded version is not reasonable.  It also matters that this would create financial hardship for her friend.  If your gf bought a more expensive version than she would have normally since she thought her friend was paying then she\u2019s an even bigger AH. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d ask the friend for max $500 which would be the approximate value of her old used one.  Maybe less given she was likely going to replace it soon anyway.", "NTA. \n\n\nit's a 5-year old laptop with battery/charging problems originally bought for less than she is demanding her friend pays. if one person wrecks another person's car, the payout will be according to the current value - which takes everything into account - age, condition before the accident, mechanical and cosmetic, etc. same should apply in this case. \n\nalso, my first thought was 'why isn't her data backed up', especially when it's a mac - i.e. less chances of having an intact hard drive in such situations (which, as far as i understand, is the case here). hopefully she understood this lesson of why it's so important to back up your data.", "NTA\n\nThe friend who had the accident should only pay what a used one of the same model damaged would be bought for.  If your GF paid $1300 5 years ago, then the same model likely can be found, used, for around $500 or so.  \n\nIt is one thing to ask her friend to cover the cost to replace the same exact model, in the same condition, but her friend doesn't owe her a BRAND NEW and UP TO DATE laptop.", "NTA. You girlfriend is taking liberties of her friend considering she was going to be getting a new laptop anyway", "Nothing depreciates faster than a computer, and a 5-year-old MacBook might as well be a dinosaur. The friend  DOES we her for the loss, but no more than the current market value of the computer. Which would be very little.\n\nFrankly, she's just trying to scam her friend out of money. Money that she does not have, obviously.\n\nNTA.\n\n\n.", "NTA. Asking full price for a five year old laptop is *steep*. Even if you include the intangible value of files (which really should've been backed up), expecting the friend to pay more than the value of the laptop is skeevy. \n\nYour girlfriend could get a decent laptop in the $500-1000 price range, or she could buy for $2000 and ask the friend to cover a reasonable portion. $1500 is too much, and it's reasonable to raise concerns about that.", "I\u2019m pissed that she would even ask for that much! I sincerely someone can tell her friend\u201d to only pay her what her old laptop was actually worth. Having been a broke college student I can only imagine what her \u201cfriend\u201d has to give up to even save up that $1,000 she initially offered ffs.\n\nYour girlfriend is an ass and not someone I would choose to be with if she\u2019s this self serving.", "NTA\n\nHopping on this to say it really shouldn\u2019t even be a debate.  Compare it to a very common car scenario.  If I crash into and total your old run down car, even if it\u2019s 100% my fault, I only owe you the value of the old run down car. If you choose to use that money towards a newer nicer car, you are free to do so, but the difference in cost is on you.  (And yes, it\u2018s my insurance making the pay out. But the law is decided on this.)", "Yeah I would've gone with the low end here.  I'd have said I was going to replace it anyways but just to pay half of my new computer.  I find that probably fair.  Or about $500 or around what I would've sold it for.", "DUDE IM PSYCHIC I LITERALLY THOUGHT WHILE READING THE POST \"damn thats alot she should only ask at most \u00a3800 as thats what a laptop with a broken battery would cost at most\" AND I WAS SPOT ON YESSSSSSSS", "I agree totally with this and completely with your parents as well. She is attempting to take major advantage of this girl in trying to get her to pay more than the original cost of her laptop 5 years of wear and tear and depreciation later. Not to mention, the girl already feels bad and isn't wealthy - so she's gouging her? Your girlfriend is not a nice or honest person.", "Exactly It sounds like an honest accident, The laptop shouldn't have been out where drinks could spill on it. If I had split a drink on a laptop I'd definitely feel guilty enough to pay towards a new one, but most people learn at an early age that if you leave expensive stuff lying around then theres a good chance it'll get broken.", "As long as it's in the same condition i.e. charger port not working properly and wear and tear.", "5 years is a lot for a laptop too, it was probably going downhill fast at that point.", "Exactly! This same thing happened to me a few years ago with an around 6-year-old laptop, and I didn\u2019t ask for anything from my friend because I knew I needed a new one soon anyway (though I know I could have, it\u2019d be fair to pitch a bit just obviously not the whole damn thing lmao)"]}
