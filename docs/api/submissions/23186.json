Due to a preexisting medical condition my pregnancy is rather hard on me. I am on early pregnancy leave so that is that but at home there is a lot that just doesn\u2019t get done. My husband does his best but his job has always been rather demanding. Due to not knowing that we are havin twins, he scheduled his own leave for the 9th month .\nMy gyno recommended I get a household helper which the insurance will cover ( we live in Germany), I told mil(59) and my mother about this, mum thought it was great but mil said I should trust others and offered herself. \nShe moved into our home on the 23rd June and it\u2019s hell.\n\nShe cooks a lot of food that I am unable to eat due to the pregnancy or allergies. She threw my bedsheets for mites allergies away(both mine and my husbands ) saying they were ugly. But they are under the decorative sheets. And the worst ? She drinks a lot of  coffee and puts cinnamon as well asand other spices in it and while my morning sickness is gone, I still think cinnamon (and vanilla ) are disgusting, the smell makes me nauseous.\nI as well as my husband have asked her multiple times to stop it but every time she just retaliates that i need to get over it. Yesterday I came home from my doctors appointment and found that not only did she make another pot of hells brew she also lit up multiple cinnamon scented candles.\n\nI yelled at her but then calmed down and just told her to pack her stuff her son will drive her home as soon as he gets here I also laid into her for not being an actual help in the past month as she barely did any housework and I often had to cook a meal for my self.\nShe cried and cried but I didn\u2019t care. Husband agreed and drove her home. I went to stay in a hotel until he cleared the apartment for the smell.\n\nMy fil and sil called today and accused me of hating mil.\n\nSo reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1690385085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a8sls/aita_for_throwing_my_mil_out_over_coffee/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really hate it when people offer to help and then do pretty much the opposite of what you've asked.\n\nAnd how dare she step foot in your house and start throwing stuff out! There is no way that can be framed as helpful. Even if she thought the sheets were ugly it's your house and you get to choose aesthetics.", "NTA.  It sure sounds like she lit those cinnamon candles just to provoke you.  MILs living under the same roof can difficult in the best of time - absolute hell when you're pregnant.  When I was pregnant with my twins my MIL came to stay and \"help\" as I was on complete bedrest.  My husband asked her to make sure I stayed hydrated.  She would take ice cubes out to our dirty garage and put them on the counter next to our cat's litter box.  Then she would smash them with a dirty hammer, scoop them in a bowl and stand there demanding I eat them while she stood there and watched.  You can only imagine how filthy and awful those ice cubes were...  Good luck to you and yours!!!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t throw her out over coffee. You threw her out for being toxic. Pregnant women have needs that sometimes can be complicated and confusing, but are legitimate, especially when it comes to sensory inputs such as smells and food.\n\nYour husband clearly has your back, so let him handle the grenades coming your way.", "NTA. I hope you find someone who actually helps you.", "NTA!\n\nWhy on earth would someone move in to \"help\" and then do the exact opposite of what the person she's supposed to be helping says?", "> My fil and sil called today and accused me of hating mil.\n\nNTA and just flip the script on them. \u201cWhy does MIL hate my unborn children so much that she wants to keep making me sick with cinnamon?\u201d", "NTA.\n\n>She moved into our home on the 23rd June and it\u2019s hell.\n\nAt any time this is awful but when you're pregnant it's unbearable.\n\n>My fil and sil called today and accused me of hating mil.\n\nThey're annoyed that she's gone back home and now they have to deal with her.", "NTA, just get the household help you need. Insurance is not exactly generous, if they think you need this, you need and deserve it.", "NTA. She sounds like a real bossyboots. \n\nDuring my first pregnancy I was super-sensitive to smells. I went off coffee and couldn't stand the smell of baking bread. It would be cruel of your MIL to inflict this on you. I don't know that she was thinking of you at all.", "NTA", "NTA. I couldn\u2019t even handle a weekend away with my MIL. You handled a month. \nGet the outside help you want/need. They are not as entitled as your MIL.", "NTA, your house, your rules. Doubly so when you're pregnant. Her refusal to accommodate a simple request from the *pregnant woman* she's supposed to be helping makes her TA.", "NTA.  Don't know what MIL's thoughts are, but let's just agree that this situation didn't work out as needed and you made the right call to pull the plug on it.  \n\nHope you now get the inhouse help you need soon and that you deliver healthy babies at the appropriate time.", "Shit I hate her just reading this. NTA and way for your hubby to have your back. I would limit the amount of time she has with your baby too. She\u2019s the kind that know better than you and may end up hurting your kid.", "You do hate her and you should! She\u2019s an a hole. You my dear are nta. She did no helping. She hurt you. She gets to go. Good for you! Hire a helper and get some sleep.", "NTA. She was a burden in the house, and wasn\u2019t there for you to perform the responsibilities that she was there to do. \n\nJust get the insurance covered helper - they would be there for a job and take it seriously. \n\nGood luck with your babies :)", "I'm an ass and would have confirmed that, yep, I do hate MIL and they can easily be added to the list. NTA. Don't let her anywhere near your baby.", "NTA Most could possibly (with a little imagination) be chalked down to misunderstandings.\n\nBut lighting multiple cinnamon scented candles. That is obviously malicious.\n\nI think she wanted to make you a little uncomfortable, and her beloved darling son a lot more comfortable. Problem is she misjudged the making you uncomfortable a little bit, and her dastardly plan backfired.\n\nAnd the real problem. Making her son super comfortable was the primary objective. Making you uncomfortable was just a bonus, and she's devastated the whole mission has gone down because she focused too much on the secondary objective.", "INFO:  How did you respond to the FIL and SIL accusations?  I kind of hope in the affirmative, because I kind of don't like your MIL after your post.  \n\nNTA at all.  I would have thrown her out after the bedsheet incident.", "NTA. Your home. Your rules. Husband needs to tell her to leave while you get the housekeeper", "Meh, sometimes we hate people and that's ok. NTA", "I would turn it back on MIL And FiL.   Why does she hate you?\n\nShe threw away your property (the bed sheets). \n\nCinnamon and vanilla mare making you nauseous and she keeps using them.  She lit up multiple cinnamon candles knowing hot make you nauseous?\n\nThis actions are hostile.  You do not need to get over it.  You needed to kick her out, which you   did.\n\nNTA", "NTA - there was nothing else to talk about.  You don't get to move into someone else's house and tell them they have to \"get over it\" about anything, much less all of the offenses you listed.  Glad your husband had your back on this one!", "NTA. Why was she there? What was in it for her? It sounds as if she just wanted time away from FIL. She threw away your stuff? Where was your husband during all this? He needs to have a talk with both of his parents.", "NTA.  She may be a decent MIL otherwise, but she's not helping you and actively making your situation worse.  You gave her multiple warnings, which she ignored, so she had to go.", "Nta, I'd hate her too! She's self-entitled and uncompromising with the person she supposed to be helping.", "NTA AT ALL!!! that is your home and the way you and your husband are agreeing on it means that she is definitely the problem. she has no care for your household or you and throwing her out is the least i would do if someone disrespected me in my and my husbands home.", "NTA, she\u2019s being a nuisance", "So\u2026are father-in-law and sister-in-law paying to replace the mattress covers then?\n\nNTA", "Nah, she's being a bitch and your husband even agrees it's making life hell. She's TA, you're NTA.", "NTA. MILs can be so awful their daughters in law, i guess there are Tons of books about this topic. It is a weird fighting-dynamic somehow.  This is toxic bullying and pushing your Limits to provoke you. She has to get that she is not in charge, and you just made that clear. It is the reaction the provoced.", "NTA.  She was completely disrespecting you & your pregnancy.  All she was doing was making things harder for you.  You are the most important person in this situation & she couldn't be bothered to help as she said she would.  And then she lit cinnamon candles after you told her the cinnamon smell bothered you & she says to get over it.  What a total AH MIL is.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds incredibly toxic.  I think you did incredibly well to only have thrown her out after a month.  I would have turfed her out after throwing out the bedding.\n\nI\u2019m sure FIL is pissed, as he thought he\u2019d gotten rid of her (and the cinnamon coffee) for at least 6 months.\n\nRelax OP and focus on your growing family", "NTA.  She had no right to move herself in and your husband shouldn't have allowed it to begin with.", "I don't know that she was thinking of you at all.", "I hope you've cut all ties and gone no contact.", "I'm also glad your husband has your back  \n\n\nRefusing to stop drinking coffee that is literally making you think sick is 100% the opposite of \"helping\"   \n\n\nNTA and glad you kicked her out; hope you can still use that insurance money to hire an actual helper! Good luck with everything", "After all this? Of course OP hates MIL and it\u2019s deserved", "NTA, She isn't helping. She is toxic and if your child has similar allergies to you. I highly doubt that she will change her ways so I would be careful with her until you know.\n\n She does not care about you. That was clear when she started cooking what you can't eat. That is intentional. \n\n If she treats you like this when you're pregnant I wonder how she will treat you after the baby. \n\nIt might help to go no contact for a while, mother-in-law needs understand that not her house, she doesn't get to do what she wants. \n\nShe wants those candles? Go home light them. Want coffee with cinnamon? Buy your coffee and keep it away from everyone else's.", "NTA \n\nI also hate your MIL.", "NTA. Tell them you so hate her because she is a liar and super rude. She did nothing to help and made a thought spot tougher. \n\nI would limit how much she gets to see the baby", "NTA", "NTA... good job", "OK yes I agree the candles a no go. But Im sure there was away around the coffee. Ie she could have put it in a mug with a lid so you could not smell it.", "Info: If this is in Germany, are you and your MIL Germans? Do you both speak the same mother language? If you are speaking to her in English and she is German, something might be getting lost in translation.", "She offered to help.  She didn't.  This is no different from firing a careworker who came from an agency.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The smells alone would get me. But I also see you said that she was making food you couldn't even eat due to food allergies or because of your pregnancy. Does she not want you to birth healthy children (her grandchildren).\n\nSo happy to see your husband is standing with you on this.  Hoping you have a safe & healthy birth.", "NTA- burning the candles that she knew would cause reaction in you when you're having nausea from morning sickness with twins?\n\nIf she didn't want to get kicked out she shouldn't have did stuff that would get her kicked out.", "Absolutely NTA, and while everyone already explainer why in fact MIL is the a*hole, I would like to add that cinnamon can be dangerous for the pregnancy, as it can induce early labour. \nSo it is not just a pain to smell, but to eat it would be of severe consequences. \nAs one cannot trust MIL, it is actually necessary to remove the MIL from the home of OP, so the apparently beloved cinnamon cannot be put \u201eaccidentally\u201c in OP\u2018s food.", "NTA\n\nShe was not only being unhelpful, she was going out of her way to do things that created more work for you and made you feel nauseous.\n\nShe sounds awful and should have been shown the door weeks ago.", "NTA I\u2019m convinced she\u2019s doing it deliberately. Good riddance!", "Go nc with his family for now.  Your MIL is toxic and useless to boot. You don't need this drama right now.  Block them. \n\nNTA", "Nta. You may find excellent advice at r/JNMIL", "NTA.  Your MIL didn't move in to help you.  She moved in to take over you.  Her agenda was focused on making that baby hers and hers alone.  I'm so happy your husband backed you up and got her out of there.", "I believe it's called hlep. It looks like help but it's really really not.", "Sometimes it's worth it to have a monetary relationship. Too cozy of a relationship and people take extra liberties. Plus, then you have to worry about drama.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Also OP has allergies hence the special sheets for dust mites. Scented candles and strong scents can cause allergies, sneezing,  runny nose, headaches.", "I don't think throwing away someone else's sheets when you're a guest in their house can be called a misunderstanding.", "Brewing coffee makes it smell. And it sounds like she was making it in their coffee maker and leaving a taste behind.", "> I **as well as my husband** have asked her multiple times to stop it\n\nMother and son certainly speak the same language.  Please stop making lame excuses for this hateful woman.", "I like this one\nCan I steal it?", "Also known as hellp as only the devil knows how.", ">My fil and sil called today and accused me of hating mil.\n\nNot to mention this - clearly mil hates OP and was being deliberately spiteful and now is trying to make her look bad."]}
