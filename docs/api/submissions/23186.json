Due to a preexisting medical condition my pregnancy is rather hard on me. I am on early pregnancy leave so that is that but at home there is a lot that just doesn\u2019t get done. My husband does his best but his job has always been rather demanding. Due to not knowing that we are havin twins, he scheduled his own leave for the 9th month .\nMy gyno recommended I get a household helper which the insurance will cover ( we live in Germany), I told mil(59) and my mother about this, mum thought it was great but mil said I should trust others and offered herself. \nShe moved into our home on the 23rd June and it\u2019s hell.\n\nShe cooks a lot of food that I am unable to eat due to the pregnancy or allergies. She threw my bedsheets for mites allergies away(both mine and my husbands ) saying they were ugly. But they are under the decorative sheets. And the worst ? She drinks a lot of  coffee and puts cinnamon as well asand other spices in it and while my morning sickness is gone, I still think cinnamon (and vanilla ) are disgusting, the smell makes me nauseous.\nI as well as my husband have asked her multiple times to stop it but every time she just retaliates that i need to get over it. Yesterday I came home from my doctors appointment and found that not only did she make another pot of hells brew she also lit up multiple cinnamon scented candles.\n\nI yelled at her but then calmed down and just told her to pack her stuff her son will drive her home as soon as he gets here I also laid into her for not being an actual help in the past month as she barely did any housework and I often had to cook a meal for my self.\nShe cried and cried but I didn\u2019t care. Husband agreed and drove her home. I went to stay in a hotel until he cleared the apartment for the smell.\n\nMy fil and sil called today and accused me of hating mil.\n\nSo reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1690385085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a8sls/aita_for_throwing_my_mil_out_over_coffee/", "score": 1597, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sure sounds like she lit those cinnamon candles just to provoke you.  MILs living under the same roof can difficult in the best of time - absolute hell when you're pregnant.  When I was pregnant with my twins my MIL came to stay and \"help\" as I was on complete bedrest.  My husband asked her to make sure I stayed hydrated.  She would take ice cubes out to our dirty garage and put them on the counter next to our cat's litter box.  Then she would smash them with a dirty hammer, scoop them in a bowl and stand there demanding I eat them while she stood there and watched.  You can only imagine how filthy and awful those ice cubes were...  Good luck to you and yours!!!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t throw her out over coffee. You threw her out for being toxic.
