So his job pays for about 3 1/2 people to live, assuming your pay covers about half of your personal expenses. That\u2019s a lot of people relying on one check. \n\nPerhaps part of that conversation could include you working full-time to help with the expenses of your household, which would allow him to cut his hours some.", "What do you do for a living?", "It sure sounds like you\u2019re the asshole. \nHe takes care of his mother and brother. \n\nYou tried to make plans on a Wednesday night for this weekend, and just made the assumption he didn\u2019t have other ideas.  Then you threaten to break up with him if he doesn\u2019t jump at the chance to visit your family with short notice. \n\nYTA\n\nNo healthy relationship is based off an ultimatum. You\u2019re childish to think you can get your way by threats. \n\nMaybe he will choose work over you. Play stupid games, get shitty prizes.", "YTA - you've known since the beginning that he's a workaholic and you still continued the relationship expecting him to change. He's young and ambitious - embrace that and support him. You're NTA for wanting to spend more time with him, just for expecting him to change when he's been like this from the beginning. Maybe start planning weekends together a little farther out so he can adjust his work commitments around them.", "You should fill your time with a full job too, so you both can save for a future you want.", "Seems like he made his choice. \n\nYou are an asshole for making plans so short notice. \nYou are an ssshole for giving him an ultimatum.\n\nYou are not an asshole for wanting to be more time with him. \nYou are not an asshole for feeling like second plance in his life.\n\nYou live together. Have you think and talked about you working a full time job to help him work less? Maybe he is concerned about supporting both of you while you only work part time. \n\nCommunication is key. You dont just make ultimatums in a relationship. They may end very badly for you. \n\nI'm gonna go with YTA. Ultimatums are a big no for me.", "Yeah YTA if he\u2019s putting more money into bills and taking care of other people as well. As much as I\u2019m sure he loves you I\u2019m sure that you aren\u2019t gonna sustain him and giving him an ultimatum bc of work is childish.", "YTA\n\nMy god I'd chuck you in a heartbeat\n.", "Yta your boyfriend is trying to build his future and you're trying to sabotage that.", "You should go date a fuckin bum with time for you. Real men bust their ass and you\u2019re lucky to have one. Yet here you are complaining on the internet.", "YTA wow. Maybe if you didnt work part time hed could work less. Getting involved with someone who is in finance and calling long hours and networking bs shows you havent show the slightest interest in his job. Worse springing weekend trip to sister a few days before. Btw a trip to sister is not quality couple time its your family time. Its not wrong to want a different type of relationship but you did this poorly.", "YTA. I get where you are coming from but as you said, he also takes care of his mom and brother. And since you only work part time are you even covering half the bills?", "\"My boyfriend is earning money and being responsible! I hate it!\" - What OP sounds like.", "YTA. 20's are the time to grind, save up and set yourself up to enjoy life more. And hes not wrong about recession. The way prices are inflating, its only a matter of time before SHTF in my opinion.\nHes earning money for BOTH of you. This is your opportunity to support him, encourage him, and remind him what he is working for, because he probably doesnt WANT to spend 12 hours a day working for someone else, yet he does it, for you. \n\nGood luck OP", "YTA.  Your 20\u2019s is precisely the time to do this and gain early career momentum.  You expect him to be at your whim, lol", "Info what work does he do and what do you do? Giving an ultimatum never works out in any one's favor. You said he also has to care for his mom and brother so he has a lot of responsibility on his shoulders. Are you helping with that?", "YTA if you have a hard working partner you need to count your blessings.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHope he breaks up with you and continues to grind and making bread! You should be glad he\u2019s working that hard,my boy just wants to retire early.", "You are 22 so you are a bit young to grasp things of the world yet. If you want someone to give you all this time and drop shit for you then I'm going to say no one is for you period cause everyone has to work and people have to do things over a weekend. Shit I'm going 11 hr days and that's normal atm for me being a nurse. \n\nRecession worries are serious and you should listen to him on that. He's right. Better to get ahead then worry with no money when shit hits the fan.\n\nJust bloody breathe and stop being selfish all about yourself. He's working hard and you should consider yourself lucky he does at all. He will make it up to you im sure\n\nYta", "YTA. people need to do a good job to, well, keep their job. and eat. and live. and he does have people that relies on him.\n\nnever go between a person and his job.", "INFO: what does your BF do?", "YTA for making this about a weekend away that you sprung on him fairly last-minute. You're resentful and 'snapped' and that's not healthy communication.\n\nIf he's not meeting your needs, and you two are just incompatible, it's reasonable for you to have that conversation, and break up if that's what you want to do. The 'ultimatum' isn't a reasonable approach, but clearly stating your needs and the consequences would be.\n\nAs difficult as it may be, you two need a time to talk about this, and you need to accept that he's going to work a lot. You say you \"hoped he would\" slow down, but did he ever promise that? It sounds like he said he's trying to work to save money (and support his mother and brother and *you*), and you heard that it wouldn't last. Don't put words in his mouth, or base your life on what you want to hear that isn't actually said (and done). Go looking for r/relationship_advice or similar; incompatibility isn't really an AH thing.", "This is my dad and it won\u2019t ever stop. There are people out there that want this arrangement, he\u2019ll find someone don\u2019t worry", "YTA - it is hard to get established nowadays and the poor man is juggling building his career and supporting those relying on him. If you want him to have more free time, maybe try getting a full-time and lifting some of that burden off his shoulders. He has 3 people that depend on him having a good job with good pay - networking while you're starting out is a crucial aspect\n\nSeparate from that, springing a weekend getaway on someone on a Wednesday without checking if they have plans then getting upset is ridiculous - that's far too short notice.", "YTA. You want someone with no ambition, go get em.", "Poor guy, overworked, need to care of his family and the person he loves not supports him and appreciate him how hard working and caring he is, but rather just bitch.", "NTA for wanting him to pay more attention to you but TA for giving him an ultimatum. I\u2019m assuming he was a workaholic before you got together. \n\nDid you ever actually talk to him during the 3 years about him slowing down with his work or did you just hope he would on his own? If you have never mentioned it before then you can\u2019t expect him to know it\u2019s been bothering you.", "NAH \n\nIt just sounds like the two of you have very different priorities in life.

Don't regret missing what him and his workaholic nature brought. The money, the stability and the safety it brings. So if you break up and you end up having it rough. Do not ask for his help. Do not get jealous if you ever hear him with another. Hear how he saved up to keep the ones he cares and loves safe and stable. That after he got enough money to keep a family happy he was able to spend time with the person he holds close.", "NTA, but what does he do? In his field, he might have a shitton of work in the first few years? \n\nAlso, he showed you he has insight and heard you. He couldnt weasel himself out of what was in front of him, but maybe things will get better now? Also he was not dismissive of your feelings.\n\nAlso, why is he a workaholic? Workaholics are often driven by mental health issues. Maybe he has some severe anxiety (after all he is going on about recession). \n\nDid you tell him beforehand and talk to him about it before the ultimatum?

You need more attention and time together to be happy with your relationship, there's nothing wrong with that, and you've explained that to him. He doesn't need that much attention, and that's not his fault either, but the real problem here is that he obviously values his own personal financial security over your happiness, and is quite happy making you wait for him to be done with all his other priorities before he makes you one.\n\nI've dated people who didn't understand that they needed to make their partner a priority, let alone how to. They don't change, and your history seems to show this.", "Leave. You have seen three years and now you think he is going to change?

Have you had a detailed conversation about this, asking him why he wants to save money as quickly, what his goal is (is it a fixed amount or is it 'more money' and basically it will never be enough/there will be no end to it)? Is he saving for a specific house, or is he planning to go back to school and wants to have $X saved up to be able to cover him taking time out from work/tuition costs etc? If you two don't share the same financial goals and him pursuing his goal is making it so you basically get nothing from the relationship, then it's fair enough to consider leaving him.", "NTA  \nI think everyone should be able to communicate what is important to them in a relationship, no matter how weird it seems to others.  \nBut it's also the partners right to not agree and leave u for it.", "NTA\n\nYou will never be his priority.", "Giving ultimatums is never healthy in a relationship. He works hard for you as a couple not just himself. If you are not happy with him end the relationship and move on. You can try to find a middle ground but ultimatums are not the way. He seems to care about you (as seen in the note he left), in todays dating market hard working people are hard to find.", "YTA.  Someone who is working 12 hours a day needs more than 2-3 days heads up to go away for a weekend.\n\nYour boyfriend is showing you who he is, and his view of work-life balance is very different than yours.  You will have to decide if you can live with that or not.", "YMBTA. Did he grow up poor? Is he the oldest son in a culture where that gives him extra filial responsibilities? Who is he supporting? I grew up super poor and I am always afraid of being impoverished again so I am really frugal and hoard money and make extra money whenever I can. I'm trying to avoid poverty more than I desire wealth.", "YTA", "YTA. Maybe if you worked full time and helped he could peel back on the hours a bit? Doesn't seem ultimatum-worthy though. It just sounds like you want your cake and eat it too.", "YTA, and do this guy a favor and actually break up with him, because someone that responsible doesn\u2019t have time for your high school romance bullshit. He worked hard enough to get y\u2019all house, and your juvenile enough to give him a end of relationship ultimatum because he\u2019s too hard working, what the fuck is wrong with you?!? Maybe get off your ass and match his energy, because I bet you the main reason why he spends so much time at work is so that he can eventually have a comfortable life with you. If my husband gave me an ultimatum like this, it would shatter my heart because it\u2019s makes all of my efforts and sacrifices meaningless. You\u2019re a terrible partner and you don\u2019t deserve his hard work.", "Plus he helps support his mom and younger brother.

Finance is also one of those careers, like many, where the lowest guy on the totem pole gets shit on to \"pay their dues\" before career advancement. Think about doctors and their residency and 24 hour calls.", "So can he. Sounds like he needs to find someone who prioritizes their career and future. A part time secretary who complains at the guy working too much is a recipe for her cheating on him because \"he's never home.\" Lady, you can go work full-time and maybe he can work less if you're putting in more money. It's like that Bill Burr bit about gold diggers waiting at the end of the race waiting for the winner rather than putting up with all the hard work and sacrifices along the way.", "If you read about why OP might be the asshole she states that he supports his mother and younger brother. In another comment she states that she works part time. I think that changes the view somewhat.", "She can work full-time so he can have more free time.

So he\u2019s probably providing for you as well, you\u2019re so incredibly selfish I hope he dumps you", "Have you considered that your lifestyle is mostly funded by the person working in finance and your part time job doesn\u2019t bring in enough income for comfortable living? \n\nDoes he have to work so much because it\u2019s not an equal financial contribution ?", "Maybe you should work full time then, maybe he wouldn't have to work extra to support his lazyass gf.", "YTA and older than him.
