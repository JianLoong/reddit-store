When he was texting everyone he told me one of his friends had a cousin over and asked would we be able to take her as well. I asked how old the cousin is and if she knows how to swim. He said ten and yes, so I said of course.\n\nWe get to the house, and I meet this cousin, and she is blind. Right away, I felt nervous. I was going to have six kids with me, and no other adults. I've always been a little neurotic about water safety. My son is a great swimmer, and so are his friends, but I've never met this girl before, and I don't know if she is a strong swimmer. I was worried that I would be constantly watching her the whole time, and that would mean I wasn't paying enough attention to the other kids. I decided to take the kids to the park instead.\n\nThe kids complained, but I said there was a problem at the pool, and they got over it. Eight year olds have short attention spans. The cousin is getting along with the boys, even though she's a couple years older. I did text all the parents to let them know where we are, for safety. The aunt of the little girl just texted me back asking me what happened to the pool plan.\n\nI texted back that I decided on the park instead. She asked why, and I said six kids at the pool is a lot, and the park is less stressful.  She asked if I didn't take them to the pool because her niece is blind. I said six kids and water with one adult is just a lot. She said I was fine with five, and it seems obvious I just didn't want to watch a blind child in water. I responded that even if that's true (which, yeah, it is, I just didn't want to admit it) would that really be so bad? If I'm not comfortable in my ability to keep the kids safe in water, I shouldn't supervise them in water.\n\nShe said if I can't keep kids safe in water I'm a bad mom and that I was being a bitch to a ten year old. I like this girl, she is so sweet, but I get anxious about water safety. Am I being a bitch? Should I take them to the pool?", "created_utc": 1667063457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygp3gl/aita_for_not_taking_a_blind_child_to_the_pool/", "score": 7543, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not comfortable taking all of them, including the girl, to the pool. That is reason enough. The aunt shouldn\u2019t be pressing you on this.

Without them, everything is just a flat mixed blur of color. I cannot judge distance or make out shapes.\n\nI say this from my own experience. As a child, I had to have close adult attention on me at the pool. I was a strong swimmer, but I couldn't locate ladders, or tell the difference between the deep and shallow end, or know where to try to get help from. I almost drowned once just because I got too close to the water slide and was knocked under with significant force. I've also hit my head on the ladders and sides of the pool at decent speeds. \n\nThere were no lifeguards, and OP was the only person who could watch the girl, and could only give her partial attention. It was an unfamiliar pool, where the girl didn't know where anything was or where to stay safe. And there would be a lot of people who didn't know about her disability and might complicate things. \n\nPlease don't call OP ableist. My own mother wouldn't have let me go with OP for these reasons. The safety of the sight impaired child is crucial, and if you're not sure you can provide that, you don't risk it.", "One adult with six kids, one of whom is blind, seems like a recipe for disaster.

And thank them even more profusely for finding an activity that still includes my kid safely. \nI commend you for still including this child in your activities today (even if it was the original plan) because you very easily could have said no to taking her at all.I wish more parents were as inclusive as you were.", "NTA\n\nIf you're not comfortable with something you shouldn't force the issue.

The idea of taking six ten year olds to the pool, and the reality of it are two completely different things no matter what their abilities are.

Six can either be calm or be rowdy, and op didn\u2019t have the parents permission only the aunts, and only another ten year olds word that she could in fact swim according to the post- her kid was texting his friend, at the time of pickup was the only time OP even talked with the aunt. At that point, I would be questioning if I was able to keep with my original plan as well - OP could have asked a bunch of questions at that point about ability, and possibly found out that the other ten year old exaggerated his cousins swimming ability or that kid is actually in training for olympics, but OP didn\u2019t, she decided that she felt more comfortable going to the park and notified everyones adults of the change in plans.", "NTA\nIf you don't feel safe taking a child you do not know to the pool that's the end of it. You aren't aware of her abilities, they didn't warn you ahead of time. The aunt could have come along to help supervise.

If something had happened (not even drowning, but a slip by the pool, in the locker room, etc) you\u2019d be the person responsible. I\u2019ll risk being thought of as rude over risking having a kid get seriously injured on my watch any day of the week.

I've always been a little neurotic about water safety. My son is a great swimmer, and so are his friends, but I've never met this girl before, and I don't know if she is a strong swimmer. I was worried that I would be constantly watching her the whole time, and that would mean I wasn't paying enough attention to the other kids. I decided to take the kids to the park instead.\n\nThe kids complained, but I said there was a problem at the pool, and they got over it. Eight year olds have short attention spans. The cousin is getting along with the boys, even though she's a couple years older. I did text all the parents to let them know where we are, for safety. The aunt of the little girl just texted me back asking me what happened to the pool plan.\n\nI texted back that I decided on the park instead. She asked why, and I said six kids at the pool is a lot, and the park is less stressful.  She asked if I didn't take them to the pool because her niece is blind. I said six kids and water with one adult is just a lot. She said I was fine with five, and it seems obvious I just didn't want to watch a blind child in water. I responded that even if that's true (which, yeah, it is, I just didn't want to admit it) would that really be so bad? If I'm not comfortable in my ability to keep the kids safe in water, I shouldn't supervise them in water.\n\nShe said if I can't keep kids safe in water I'm a bad mom and that I was being a bitch to a ten year old. I like this girl, she is so sweet, but I get anxious about water safety. Am I being a bitch? Should I take them to the pool?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not saying for sure but a conversation with the aunt about your feelings could have given either you ease about taking her or allow yourself decide if your still have concerns and would prefer either a different activity or her not attending. She may have still been upset if you had insisted option 2 but again no one is entitled to be extremely uncomfortable especially when it comes to children. People who are blind for the most part can and should be able to do anything anyone else can of course but there is some very specific times where they cannot unfortunately.

You didn't know how to handle the situation, it caused you stress, and six kids at a pool is a lot of responsibility! You don't need added concern when you already have your hands full. It also should've been something they made you aware of just so that you were prepared. I think the park was a completely okay and valid thing to do in that circumstance. Not offensive, and still included the little girl.\n\nQuite honestly I think the aunt is just overly protective of her niece. My parents did this to me sometimes as well. They'd be offended on my behalf because they were trying to be protective. She likely just didn't want her niece to be upset or feel singled out.

I\u2019ve been both a life guard and a daycare worker and let me tell you there is a *reason* there are legal limits on how many children an individual worker can be responsible for and tbh they are too high.

We had swim lessons for groups of up to ten kids at a time and whenever we had a special needs child, we always had an aide assigned to that child one-on-one.

With any situation involving children and water, the best thing to do is overestimate the dangers, underestimate your own ability to see everything all the time, and take nothing for granted. (I.e. don't trust that a child can swim just because they or their parents tell you they can; being able to swim means different things to different people.)\n\nRealistically, if OP took that group to the pool, she would be spending more time watching the child who can't see potential hazards.

I was the disabled kid who never got to do stuff because none of my friends parents would just ask me, or my parents, or the aunt and uncle taking care of me what I'm capable of. I walked on crutches on and off as a kid (and still do sometimes). My legs never worked right, but I was a tough, active kid who played sports and climbed trees and wanted to be included. I got left behind when kids went to the pool or went horseback riding all the time, despite being fully capable of swimming and riding. Because other kids parents decided because I was different that I couldn't participate. They refused to accept my capabilities, and limited my opportunities because of it. They're super quick to decide you have all these limitations though, even without asking you. Fun fact: it doesn't stop when you grow up. People still decide I can't do things without asking me. So they just go bowling or to mini putt without me.", "100% agreed. She fully evaluated the situation and decided it wasn't worth the risk.

It\u2019s common courtesy or should be to make sure the adult knows what the child does or doesn\u2019t need in terms of assistance.
