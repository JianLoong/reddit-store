Even if you told him, he wouldn't enjoy coming over to see his daughter.", "NTA, love that you are a safe space for your niece with everything she's going through with her father. Your brother just needs to realize and own up to his part in having a bad relationship with his daughter and stop blaming others.", "NTA. Sounds like she's better of without him. She would stop visiting you anyway if you did inform your brother. It's good she has you to visit.", "Clarification: He does not have custody of her (shared or otherwise) and never has.", "Absolutely NTA. At 15 yrs old, your niece is old enough to know toxicity when she sees it. Thank goodness she has a supportive and protective family like you.", "NTA. First of all, good for you for providing a loving, safe place for your niece to go to and relationships where she feels secure. Also, your brother is not her primary caregiver, and it sounds like he doesn\u2019t have any sort of custody, so you are not obligated to tell him when she comes over, any more than one of her friend\u2019s parents would be if she went to one of their homes. \n\nYou had the perfect response to him when he asked about if your kids went over to his place without your knowledge. \n\nYour brother seems determined to blame everyone for what is wrong with his life except for himself. Don\u2019t let him make you feel bad - you are doing an incredibly good thing for your niece, something that will provide her with a point of stability and love in her life. Never apologize for that.", "NTA your brother is responsible for his own actions. It's great that your niece has somewhere she wants to be", "NTA, he's not in any place to decide things for his daughter in the state he's in. He also has no bearing on your relationship with your niece. She is old enough to pick for herself and has done so", "NTA - Your brother is obviously not the custodial parent and your niece is 15. So there is no reason, legal or otherwise, to let him know where his daughter is. \n\nMake sure to remind your niece that she is welcome at your house whenever and that you don't blame her for her dad's reaction.

Your niece is going to be 1000x better off because she has you and your family as a supportive, loving, and stable presence in her life.

You aren't obligated to invite him.", "NTA.  In fact, I'll go a step further and say you should NOT invite him or inform him when she's visiting you.  She's 15, not 5, and probably would not feel so comfortable visiting you if you included her dad and the drama he brings.  I suspect your home is a safe haven to her and this should not be compromised.\n\nAs you suggested to him, HE needs to work on his relationship with her, not blame others for his failings and missteps.  If he really cares about this young lady, he can begin by making sure he supports her financially as she needs and deserves.  That's what good fathers do.", "NTA! Your niece needs stability and good influences in her life, and her dad is clearly more interested in creating drama than fixing his relationship with his daughter. Daughter sees you as a safe space and place. That's great that she's that well-adjusted at 15.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say he doesn't have primary custody and mom's in charge.  You're protecting her autonomy and creating a safe space for her to rely on, which is important for kids. It takes a village especially when they have a chaotic parent.", "Lol if he wants a relationship with his kid, unblocking her is a good start. NTA. At some point, it\u2019s a bit impossible to imagine that everyone is scheming alongside the \u201cevil\u201d ex - but that requires retrospection that he\u2019s probably not capable of.", "NTA... I wonder why everyone is against him /s", "NTA\nIt would be weird to report the whereabouts of every relative that visits your home to anyone. Especially relatives who are old enough to travel and communicate independently. OP nailed it. If the dad is unhappy about something his daughter did/is doing, he should discuss that with his daughter.\n\nIt sounds like he'd spoil the visits if he did get his way. Parenthood carries responsibility. It does not create obligations in other people.", "I am gonna say NTA regardless bc you have your nieces best interests in mind when doing what you're doing, but\n\nINFO: does he have custody of her at the times she's going to your home? Or is she in the legal care of her mother at these times?\n\nBc thats the only area I might tell you just to be careful on, for your own sake and your nieces. If he currently has legal custody of her (even if it's just \"his day\" but otherwise doesn't have primary custody, whatever their custody agreement is) he probably does have a legal right to know where his child is since she's his legal responsibility. (And again, I only say that as a warning bc thats something he might theoretically use against you.)\n\nHowever if it's mom's custody time, then as long as she knows where her child is it should be fine. Daughter isn't in legal care of your brother at that point in time, so he doesn't inherently have to know where she is at all times.\n\nBut I'm NAL so take that with a grain of salt, I just know a little bit of secondhand (and possibly dated) knowledge of that stuff from my dad who is a lawyer and did custody cases back in the 90's. Just something to consider.", "NtAH - I lived with various family members because my egg donor was abusive, and I specifically asked that my family respect my wishes to not associate with her.  They have all learned to do as I asked.  He did this to himself.  You need to focus on her - not him.  If you give in to him - he will not his behavior but become embolden because he will see you doing what he wants as proof that is in the right.  People like him, they don't understand boundaries.  They believe it is very much you against them if you are not with them.  A lot of the time - even when you are with them - they see you as against them.  Nothing is going to change that.  So, protect what you got and leave him to his own misery.", "NTA - you do not need to get into the drama by folding your niece into the issues you have with your brother.
