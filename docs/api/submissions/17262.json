He is the golden child, in our culture the first born son is always put on a pedestal. As a result he grew up spoiled while I was treated like a second-class citizen (allowed out with friends in elementary/high school, I was not. Parents made excuses for piss poor grades, I was asked why I got A- instead of A+, etc). We grew up in the same house but had very different childhoods. I have gone to plenty of therapy and am pretty much no contact with my brother, and was low-contact with my mom for years. \n\nAnyways, for mothers day I offered to take my mom out for dinner, make her favourite food or order in. Whatever she wanted really.\n\nI got to her house and brought flowers, card, all the clich\u00e9 normal mother's day gifts and she was happy. After asking again what she wanted for dinner I see her slip away into the basement to ask my brother what he wanted for dinner (which was pizza). \n\nAfter hearing that I reminded her no, I was paying for HER dinner, not his, and if he wanted to pitch he can. It turned into this huge fight where she blew up saying if I couldn't order food for everyone and pay, or take money from her to pay for his portion, then not to bother. I decided to cancel dinner because I'm not going to take money from her, nor am I going to enable my brother to continue to be a freeloader. I told her when she would like to go out to dinner with just the two of us to let me know, because the day is about her and not about enabling him out of whatever guilt she may feel. She yelled at me saying that's \"not my business\" (she usually does when I comment on it) and I responded with I'm allowed to express my opinion when it's something that so clearly affects aspect of her life. He apparently didn't have $20 to spare to pitch for getting her dinner and told me to fuck off when I asked if paying me back later instead could be an option. \n\nShe later ended up ordering pizza for herself and him, I declined and went home. \n\nMy brother works full time and doesn't pay rent (he's never actually held down a position longer than 6 months before calling in sick after going on too many benders). He's entitled, rude, has a gambling addiction, contributes nothing to her home and she constantly cleans up after him (dishes/garbage). If he asks for money she will give it no questions, and pays for all groceries. The only thing he does on his own is his laundry (doesn't mow the grass or even take out garbage) and it's honestly pathetic. My mom and I have had several conversations about this topic and she agrees with me, but when it comes to dealing with him face to face she completely folds. She refuses therapy. \n\nI feel slightly bad, it probably wasn't a good day to choose to die on that hill. But I refuse to enable my adult brother and contribute to the ongoing reason he lacks so much independence. \n\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684112930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ht4fi/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_brother_on/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she want to go out for dinner with you fine, but not a penny to your brother.  Great boundry.", "NTA. You told her you were treating her to dinner and set the boundary. The least he could have done was help you pay for it instead of telling you to F off.\n\nContinue low contact if she refuses to get him help.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to decide that your Mother\u2019s Day gift to her includes paying for him.\n\nThey sound exhausting.

They should be enjoying their golden years stress free, but they haven't had a relaxing moment from the time that they were \"blessed\" with this boy.

If your Mom doesn't take any action, the next 26 years will arrive in the blink of an eye without any changes.

You're going to have to anyway because eventually she's going to come crying to you she needs help and the brother can't because wahhhhh and then what. \n\nJust stop. Stop going over there\nStop making an effort. Stop upsetting yourself. She's not going to change. He's always going to be her Golden Boy. ESH because at this point you go over to pick fights. I understand and I think you're right and I get why you're mad but you're making yourself and her miserable. Maybe she deserves that but you don't. \n\nYes, it's unfair. Yes, you can be angry. You have to stop. Make it clear you will never take the brother and then walk out of this.", "NTA but learn to stay in the  lane your mom put you in..I\u2019m not going to say cut her off because you obviously love her no matter what but stop putting yourself out there for her if she\u2019s going to keep hurting you emotionally.. check on her get her roses and cards and that\u2019s it ..anything that brother can in anyway be involved with (freeloading off of) stop the interaction before it gets to that point.. you will be so much happier knowing when to say when.. it worked for me I\u2019m sure it will work for you", "ESH.  You seem more focused on confronting your brother than celebrating your mother.  It\u2019s her day so what she wants.  You know that she is going to cater to her boy about dinner especially if you\u2019re eating at home.  She does this everyday!  They live together.  It\u2019s a pizza did you honestly think she wouldn\u2019t offer him some.  Did you really expect him to give some cash? It sounds like you wanted a confrontation with him and was hoping for your mom to stand up to your brother.    \nlet\u2019s be clear you are within your right to be no contact with your brother.  But you know your mom created this monster/situation.  Where\u2019s your anger at her?  Why put this all on him?  Maybe it\u2019s best for you to just stay away from both of them.", "Sort of iffy.  I get your point, but if it would make her happier to have him included and she was willing to pay for his food, that sort of falls into an \"it's her day and she should be able to do as she wants\" camp.\n\n\nBut with that said, if it would ruin it for you to have to sit with him, that's a valid point also.\n\n\nThe part that makes it iffy is that your attitude toward your brother probably affected your actions.  Trust me, I have enough similar emotional baggage to understand exactly where you are coming from.  But it sounds like everything spiraled out of control.\n\n\nSo for this year you had a misunderstanding/misstep/whatever.  Hopefully you apologized for upsetting her.  Going forward, figure out a plan that will avoid all the problems you faced this year, even if it's choosing to eliminate the buying her lunch part of honoring her because it ends up being so contentious.", "ESH. I don't know why you cut off your brother instead of your mother. She's the one treating you unfairly, he didn't ask to be born second.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
