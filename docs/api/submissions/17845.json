Your concern is more about how sitting alone makes you look, not your friend's feelings or anything.\n\nHow does one person lack so much self-awareness??", "Aww, honey, you weren't \"stood up.\" You were stormed out on, which is infinitely more embarrassing. \n\nYTA", "100+% yta", "YTA \n\nIf you all can\u2019t accommodate her schedule then don\u2019t.", "Girl please. You went to Facebook to cry about this and you're saying she's the immature one? Just admit you're jealous she's happier with her life than you and move on. Oh and learn how to sit somewhere alone because that's nothing to be embarrassed about. YTA", "YTA\n\nAre you fucking serious? She runs her own business and gets to make her own hours. You do not get to force your own very narrow idea of what an adult is on someone else. You're the one who needs to grow up and you will be lucky if she even allows you to apologize.", "YTA. You need to spend time adjusting your attitude & drafting a sincere apology. You aren\u2019t going to receive one from her as she has nothing to apologize for.  You need to grow up.", "YTA\nDoubly so for saying the father of your kids is babysitting them instead of parenting.", "YTA. How does your brain work?You sound jealous of her lifestyle. I know I am. Or are you just filled with regret because the life you chose makes you so miserable that you\u2019d think you can bully an adult to live your life?", "YTA. Who are you to police when other people wake up? And did you ever think maybe she doesn\u2019t want to find a husband and is happy with her life? Sounds like jealousy to me. Also, parents aren\u2019t \u201cbabysitters\u201d, it\u2019s called parenting your child.", "YTA. You don\u2019t think she has a good enough reason to sleep in even though she works until late. Do you feel the same about people who work night shift?? This is ridiculous and you are a judgemental AH.", "YTA, and Id swear you posted this story before with minor differing details. Could be a massive coincidence, but it was determined that OP was the AH too. People work different schedules and there is nothing wrong with that. People work 2nd and 3rd shift while\u2026gasp\u2026 being in relationships. Shocker, I know. Kind of sounds like your jealous and projecting your own issues on your friends.", "Omg is this post for real? If it is , madam, calm down. Her sleep schedule is really none of your business. My cousin  functions like this, and Guess what, so does her husband. If changes need to occur she'll make them on her own. I don't understand you.", "l can't even \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 lady, you don't like that your friend runs her own business and can do what she likes? She is an ADULT. She can work late until 4am if she likes. A lot of us neurodivergent people work best late at night. It's when we thrive.\n\nYTA 100% in this situation, she is not your 13 year old daughter and you have no place trying to tell her how to live her life. You are trying to shame her and tell her that no man will want her??? That is not a good friend, and I'm not surprised that she reacted how she did.\n\nYou should apologize to this friend and accept the fact that people don't need to fit a cookie cutter mold to feel happy. If she doesn't accept your apology then that is ok. What you said is pretty bad and TBH I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who felt that way about me.", "YTA", "You sound jealous she has a life that she lives how she wants", "YTA plain and simple. How this woman chooses to live her life is none of your business. Period. You asked her out for a meal she told you the time that works for her and you accepted. If you had a problem with it you could have declined plain and simple. I wish I could operate under her sleep schedule but the corporate world doesn't operate that way so here I am pissy at 5:30am Monday through Friday but best believe I'm taking a weekend day and sleeping until my body says it's rested. My husband and son are the same way. Get over yourself and perhaps take your own advice.", "YTA. My husband works remotely for a company based in a different time zone and he basically has the same sleep schedule as your friend. He did that intentionally because he functions better that way. Honestly, it's fine. Being a morning person doesn't make you a better person than someone else.", "YTA. When I had little ones I was a early riser. The perfect time for me to go out for breakfast and coffee was 6 in the morning. Would you be up for that?  Could I tell you, you need to get your life together. \n\nIf she is working till 4 in the morning and if she doesn\u2019t get up until after noon that sounds about right. \n\nWhy does it concern you?", "Fake as false nails. \nYTA if there is even a trace amount of truth to this blaberous post.", "In what world do you think you\u2019re not the AH here. How she lived is her choice and you have no say in it. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll never hear from her again.", "YTA, and you're clearly jealous of your friend\n\nShe doesn't \"sleep in til midday.\" she works until early hours and gets an average amount of sleep for an adult. She has her own business, so can make her own hours, and why the hell shouldn't she do what works for her in her life? \n\nIf she worked shifts (eg a nurse) would you bitch her out then?  Or are you just one of those parents who expects non parents to bend you your will because you had kids?", "Assuming this is even real because it sounds so absurd - YTA. It\u2019s none of your business what time she goes to bed and wakes up.\n\n>not all of us are lucky enough to be able to sleep in whenever we want\n\nSo you're jealous because she can sleep in and you can't.\n\n>which is frankly ridiculous\n\nIt's not ridiculous and it's also none of your business. You don't get to make rules and pass judgement on someone else's schedule.\n\n>it\u2019s time to grow up and stop acting like a teenager. I said that she\u2019s in her 30s and it\u2019s long overdue she learned how to wake up early.\n\nAgain, none of your business. \n\n>I called bullshit and said she had to stop making excuses for her bad habits.\n\nAre you listening to yourself? \n\n>I was furious and made a Facebook post\n\n...?\n\nYou're basically trying to tell your friend what time to go to bed and what time to get up, and when she tells you to drop it you just keep going. Because you just won't stop she walks out and because *you* can't let it go you post on Facebook?\n\nYou've overstepped friendship boundaries by a mile and if she's prepared to accept your apology I suggest you practice minding your own business in future.", "Yta 100% for sure. First, its none of your business at all and the only person acting like a chikd here is you, sticking your nose in someone elses life where it doesnt belong to the extent of their sleep schedule. Shes getting 8 hours of sleep, not sleeping 18 hours a day. Shes not being a bum, shes just working a schedule different from yours. Plenty of functional adults work night shifts. Hopefully she realizes what you are and steers clear from here on out. Its boggling the entitlement you seem to feel thinking you can tell another adult how and when to sleep and to insult them over it", "YTA you complain about her needing to grow up but your first reaction was post it onto Facebook, grow up.", "You just sound jealous dude. You need to grow up. YTA", "Yta sounds like someone is a little jealous lol typical mombie martyr nonsense. Grow up and realize not everyone has to have the same schedule you do. Sounds like your friend made the right move ditching you", "OP you mentioned she's going to sleep at 3/4 and waking up at 11/12... that's 7-8 hours of sleep a night. That's the minimum amount of sleep a human needs. Are you saying she needs to grow up and... sleep like a teenager who pulls all nighters and wakes up early for school the next morning on 3-4 hours of sleep? YTA. \nShe's on a healthy sleep schedule with excellent time management and a career. Why don't you grow up instead?\n\nEdit because I forgot to add that you're being sexist by implying your friend is living her life for some hypothetical future man she may or may not want. And if she DOES want a man, she doesnt have to settle from some picky sexist AH who doesnt support her lifestyle or career.", "So this whole post comes across as nothing but jealous. \n\nYou sound jealous of the fact that she can wake up whenever the hell she wants. As an adult, she can make the freaking choice for herself. \n\nYou sound like her mom, not her best friend. \n\nYou're the one that needs to grow up. Stop acting like someone else's life needs to look like yours. Or like it's your job to correct another adult's life choices. \n\nYTA\n\nI hope she reconsiders your \"friendship.\"  No one should be friends with someone that drips disdain for them.", "YTA\n\nThis post is so obvious that you're the asshole that it has to be fake.  How does her schedule impact your life? You can't meet her anytime other than 9am? Them don't meet her. Easy. Grow up.", "YTA.\n\nYou wanted what's best for her but with your standards in mind, not hers. It sounds like she's doing well for herself, running her own business from home, and it appears she's making ends meet? How is that not being grown up and responsible?\n\nAnd not all people do well on a 'normal' sleep schedule. Some people need more sleep, some less, and some people are more inclined to be productive at night, some during the morning, some midday, it's just how their body is meant to function for that individual person.  This was told to me by my SLEEP SPECIALIST.\n\nYou need to apologize if you value your friendship with her.", "Hi, I\u2019m in a similar position as your friend and i also very rarely do early morning things. I\u2019ve never been a morning person and am never at my best in the mornings and it throws my sleep schedule off so I\u2019ve structured my life in a way where i can actually cater to my needs. What is wrong with that? Nothing! You sound awful. YTA through and through.", "YTA!!! Omg!! Who on earth do you think you are?! Are you stuck in the 1950s?! Not everyone wants kids and marriage or has to be in bed by 9pm to rise at 6am. You sound bitter and jealous. Go home to your husband and kids; you are obviously incapable of socialising with anyone that deviates from your idea of the perfect life. YTA!!!!", "Wake up times are not a mark of adulthood or maturity. Like, i'm 40 yrs old, worked several jobs, both daytime and nighttime, and two or more at a time. But i start functioning best anywhere after 4 or 5 pm. Sure i'll be up at the crack of dawn, because kids... What else can i do. But i'll be half a zombie/ in slow mode. At 4 pm, i'll get that burst of energy kickin in like, 'Yea let's fkn gooo' , and that has kept me up nights. It has taken me the better part of 15 yrs to turn that somewhat around, and i'm still not all there in the early morning.   \n\n\nAlso, we are not all that uncommon. Part of society just has a different biological clock when it comes to productivity.   \nYTA. You are the one in need of growing up, or atleast learning that not all people function like you do.", "YTA why do you care when she wakes up?  Her life is different than yours. That\u2019s OK! Not everyone else to be just like you and do things the way that you do.  Why couldn\u2019t you look at it as meeting her for lunch?\nAlso immediately rushing to post about her on Facebook  (eyeroll)  is AH behavior, as is calling your husband doing his child care duties \u201cbabysitting\u201d.", "Oh my OP, YTA and bougie and petty (and not in the good way) and frankly pea green with envy! Your jealousy is rolling off your post like the stink from a 3 week old decomposing body.", "YTA. Her sleep schedule comes to her naturally and she lives a life that allows her to not have to fight her body. That has nothing to do with maturity level. Actually, it does, she is mature enough to figure out how to arrange her life to best prioritize her wellbeing, without simply refusing to work. That's awesome for her!", "YTA . Sounds like the one who needs to grow up is you . You can\u2019t always have it your way . She\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf right . She can wake up when she wants to .", "YTA\n\nJealousy sure looks ugly on you.", "YTA.  If I were her, I would never be your friend again.  You need to apologize.   I hope you have history of truly being there as a supportive friend to her, otherwise this would have been the straw that broke the camels back.   Best friends don\u2019t talk to their best friends this way.", "YTA and sound a little bitter. If she works until 4 am she will ofc not meet with you at 9 am. Do you resent her the freedom she has?", "YTA. Your friend\u2019s life sounds awesome. You sound insane, invasive, and jealous. If she ever wants to see you again, and I doubt it, accept that this is a lunch friend not a breakfast friend and plan accordingly.\n\nAlso your husband doesn\u2019t \u201cbabysit\u201d his own kids\u2026 that\u2019s called \u201cparenting.\u201d Ugh.", "INFO: I\u2019m unclear about why her schedule is ridiculous. Is it because it\u2019s not yours?", "YTA. Her sleep schedule is none of your business. The only one acting immature here is you. You're also flat out wrong- not everyone is built to wake up early. She's running her own business and doing just fine, it's not like you even had the pretense of worrying her sleep was funky bc she's depressed or sick. You sound super jealous that she's living how she wants and you're beholden to husband/kids/traditional office hours. Who tf meets up in the mornings as adults anyway? Most people do lunch or dinner in my experience, they either have work at 9 or want to take advantage of their only days to sleep in.", "YTA - you should find a healthy way to work through your jealousy and bitterness, which are very much a you problem.", "YTA. I have the same-ish schedule, though I have meeting for my business which require me to wake earlier a few days a week. \nGood man has accepted it fine. Have a kid and kid also has similar schedule\nI'm much older than your friend and don't think I'll change anytime soon. \nNewsflash: not everyone needs to live the way you do.", "YTA. She is entitled to live her life the way she wants, she didn't ask for your advice and doesn't need your judgement. You have choices, if you don't want to meet her in the afternoons, don't.\n\nYou are doubly TA because you told her to grow up, yet you are the one using Facebook to air your grievances like some disgruntled 15 year old.", "Oh, YTA... Im going to presume that YOU hate getting up so early or are just naturally an early bird. One of my best friends had this same schedule because it was nothing for her to be up painting or doodling at 3 a.m., when I was getting up to pee in the middle of the night. It's not not being an adult. It's her natural circadian rhythm... some people are naturally better to function at later hours. I'd venture a guess she's probably one of the more productive people you know. \n\nWhere you went wrong in all of this is not acknowledging their preferences in meeting up because it's inconvenient for YOU. \n\nIf you value your friendship, you should consider that your friend is happy to make time for you and spend time with them. Should you travel with them? No... that would be a nightmare for both of you. Can you adjust your schedule a bit to spend time with your friend on occasion? Yes. You can. \n\nI say all this knowing my night owl friend joked that I'd turn into a pumpkin by 9 PM when she's just getting ready to go out, and I'm awake with the sunrise. We still made it work.", "I agree. It\u2019s not unbelievable by any means (I\u2019m a childless woman and have had people make very similar comments to me) but I feel like I\u2019ve seen this exact scenario multiple times on this sub, down to the working from home bit.", "Are you surprised? She needed her husband to babysit \u2026 \ud83d\ude44\n\nOP YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re the one who needs to grow up.", "I am a night owl who has worked second or third shift my entire life. I get SO MANY people acting like this is somehow a personal failing rn use being a morning person is \u201cbetter\u201d. \n\nThe rest is sexism and jealousy.", "I agree that it is dubious. It reads like a badly-written checklist of trigger points for the average AITA sub-user. Judgment is TROLL.", "Ding ding ding! Classic \u201cwhy isn\u2019t her life dictated by kids and a husband\u201d jealousy. \n\nI\u2019m glad the friend left OP.", "My husband doesn't care if I sleep until 10 or 11 am. I can get up early if needed, but unless I have to I would prefer staying up later and sleeping in. Worked night shift for years.", "Exactly!!!!!!!", "This.", "Yep, OP is definitely the YTA- to be fair though, does sound like they could probably do with a sleep\u2026", "I totally agree. OP is not a good friend and doesn't seem to understand that it is actually more mature for her friend to tailor-make her life to suit her instead of becoming unhappy by following what everyone else does. \n\nAlso, the husband line is obviously just not correct. I am sure if a man is like OP then he wouldn't be interested, but there are many men with similar work schedules or who wouldn't even care because they would be in work themselves when their wife is working :S it's so bizarre to think that *that* would be a deal-breaker for most men when, let's be honest, that is a minor issue at best considering what types of people there are in the world.", "I could visualize OP stomping her foot in a little tantrum while I was reading it.", "Yes, I guess all those people working at night are acting like teenagers.", "AND SHE SAID SHE\u2019S GOTTEN NO APOLOGIES \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\"She runs her business from home\"...seems pretty \"grown up\" to me...No?? \ud83d\udcaf YTA", "Totally agree. People make comments like this wayyyy too often. I am married with 6 kids. I work night shift. People are always saying crap like, \u201cwhat about the kids? Who gets them ready for school? Who makes dinner? Who feeds the baby at night?\u201d As if there\u2019s no possible way I could have a competent husband who can manage things when I am working or sleeping during the day. \n\nThe friend should be allowed to live her life however works best. Advice like OP was giving only should be given if someone is asking for help making a change because they want to change.", "It fits the pattern right down to waiting for an apology.", "\"I think my friend is immature for doing WFH/running a small business from home\" definitely seems like a recurring troll here", "I am baffled by the whole getting \"stood up\". OP's friend showed up, was insulted and left. That's not being stood up. That's leaving a coffee get together after you've been treated poorly by your alleged friend.", "OP is like a Venn diagram for assholes, in both the \u201csuccessful people get up at dawn\u201d crowd and the \u201cwhen you find a husband you\u2019ll see\u201d crowd. Probably in the \u201cwait until you have a baby!\u201d crowd too.", "Not a morning person either. I dragged myself out of bed for years but now that I consult from home, my day starts no earlier than 8:30 am.", "I've done both - I mostly worked early starts for years, and then I finally had employment that suited my body in regards to sleep schedules etc and I was 10x more focused and productive and happy.", "Meanwhile, I\u2019m just impressed by people who can be productive at that time. I\u2019m a night owl but NOT competent enough to do actual work at that time. Second/third shift should be more highly respected, not less.", "I\u2019m a night owl who would always specifically look for 2-3 shift because I cannot wake up in the morning. My body clock has always gotten it\u2019s deepest, most restful sleep between 8-11am. If I don\u2019t get that I\u2019m basically drunk and cannot function at all.", "Yep! 100%! Sounds like OP is jealous that her ex friend only has to worry about herself and not whether she has a husband to babysit for her to me."]}
