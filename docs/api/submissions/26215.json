Arthur and I have been dating since the 5th grade, we got pregnant with our daughter, Violet (13f) when we were 15. After Violet was born, we decided we wanted to wait before making any big decisions about our lives.\r  \n\r  \nLast year, Arthur and I decided it was finally time for us to get married. He went out and bought a ring and shortly after we started making wedding plans.\r  \n\r  \nOur daughter Violet is everything to us and we wanted to make sure that she was a part of helping out with the wedding. Violet had her own stuff going on with school, but she was helping us decide how she would be a part of our wedding throughout. \r  \n\r  \nDuring this process, as I said, she had her own stuff going on. Violet is autistic and has never been very social, she hasn\u2019t been bullied but also didn\u2019t have many friends. This is why we were surprised when she told us a boy, Brighton, asked her to be her valentine this year. She then told us how he would always invite her to play with his team and he\u2019d teach her the skills for the games and they\u2019d win because him and his friends were athletic boys, on the baseball team and she thought he was out of her league.\r  \n\r  \nIn the past 6-7 months, he and Violet have been dating and Violet has become much more social. Violet was also never a hugger or kisser, even refusing them from me and Arthur, but with Brighton, she is normally the one asking for hugs and kisses. Brighton was invited to the wedding and Violet helped him find a matching suit with her dress and he\u2019s been amazing during this process. We helped his baseball team\u2019s fundraiser by buying magnets for them and putting them in the goodie bags. \r  \n\r  \nDuring the wedding last week, Brighton and Violet shared a slow dance and in Violet\u2019s speech, she mentioned how she hoped her and Brighton would end up like us one day. Violet was with him almost the entire time.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue with this was how my mother (57f) and my sister (26f) reacted. Both of them kept asking me what Violet was so attached to Brighton, especially when she wouldn\u2019t even hug or kiss them or Arthur and me. I told them to let it go, but they kept insisting to me it was disrespectful. Our dad tried intervening, telling them to lay off but they wouldn\u2019t. I then asked to speak to dad privately and asked him if he could move this convo to the car and try to get to them. He did that, and after about 20 minutes they finally came back.\r  \n\r  \nShortly after the wedding was over, both mom and my sister were texting me saying it was rude of me to put my issues onto him and insisted I should talk to my daughter about how family is just as important as Brighton.

Your daughter is a teenager who has her first boyfriend, of course he is going to be the center of her world. They are total AHs for feeling the need to address this at the wedding and it was very gracious of your father to spend 20 minutes of his time calming them down. \n\nI could have a little more respect for you Mom and sister if they are worried that Brighton will break Violet's heart one day. Maybe he will, and you, her mother, will help her deal with that if occurs. They don't need to but in where they aren't needed.", "Not relevant, but if your daughter's name really is Violet - that is such a lovely name.\n\nNTA.  Children should not be forced to hug relatives if they don't want to.  It's sends a very poor message about body autonomy.  I'm glad Violet has such great parents.", "NTA, your mom and sister are clueless and interjecting themselves in a teenager's first love. WTF is wrong with them?", "NTA, not at all. The bride or groom should never have to \"manage\" guests who are being inappropriate. And they WERE being inappropriate, because they should have waited for another time to talk to you about what was bothering them.", "NTA. Violet is your daughter. Your mother and sister should not be interfering with how you and your partner is raising her or allowing her to act around her boyfriend.\n\nIt was also entirely reasonable to ask your father to take your mother and sister aside/elsewhere to have this talk. It was *your* wedding, and they were either making a scene or were about to. You deserved to enjoy your wedding without the two of them acting up or forcing you to deal with it on your happy day. Your father did the right thing by stepping in to allow you to enjoy the wedding.\n\nAnd your mother and sister are just being petty, being jealous of the attention your daughter gives to her first love.", "Nta they need to back off your daughter, she has the right to her own bodily autonomy.", "NTA, they were out of line. You sound like an awesome mom, I'm so happy for your daughter, my youngest brother is autistic and I'd do anything to find something for him that would make him as happy as you describe your daughter.

Don't let them around Violet until this is resolved.", "It didn't occur to you that your mother/sister were concerned about all the PDA because *you* got pregnant at 14? Violet saying in her speech she \"wanted to end up like you\" probably came across as similarly concerning even though I doubt it was meant that way.\n\nNTA for asking them to table the discussion, but I'm not sure they needed to be exiled to the car for the reprimand.", "Nta, they are being weird and controlling. Violets physical affection is not for them to control. Maybe she just sees physical affection in a romantic way.", "NTA. I\u2019m similar to your daughter & so is my oldest. \nWe do not like being touched we both on spectrum also. Unless we say we ok with it we will shun away from touch family, friends, partners even each other at times as mum/daughter. Your daughter is 100% comfortably with her partner. She can open up to him in ways we do not with anyone else. She is relaxed & is her self fully. It\u2019s not disrespectful to others. It\u2019s just who we are while others try to force contact on us as they assume it\u2019s ok to force it as to them human contact is normal like us not wanting to be touched is normal. Its also a sensory thing in ways attached to our emotions\n\nAs parents we also teach our kids to not allow anyone to touch them in any form even hug unless they ok with it. We need to make sure while teaching that we respect their wishes to their bodies just like anyone else. \n\nIn time your daughter might give hugs as she gets older, I do at times now I\u2019m older but still depends who, when & why.. your mum & sister need to back off as it will just push your daughter away from them if they tell her she is being disrespectful & hurtful for not giving them what they want while disrespecting her wants/needs/body.", "Your wedding day is not some \"explanation needed immediately\" day.\n\nIdiots are everywhere.\n\nNTA.", "Nta - but do make sure you are touching base with your daughter about not hyperfixating on the approval of her boyfriend - not cuz she's autistic, but because she's a 13yo girl. Especially as she thought he'd never like her. She's also *very* young to be in that long of a relationship. \n\nNot saying its a problem, they were still AHs, but don't lose sight of a potential issue just because someone took it to an unreasonable extreme, you know?", "NTAH.

My autistic son cannot stand someone whispering in his ear so a hug is stressful if he thinks they may talk while hugging.  He can\u2019t stand chewing sounds so if someone is chewing gum then forget it.  Some are sensitive to loud noises, scents, certain fabrics.  There is a whole lot going on with a simple hug.

I honestly thought this was going to be a big issue in finding a partner, but when I met my husband I found that not only do I not mind him touching me, I actually seek it out. Still hate it when others touch me, but for some reason he\u2019s okay. I really don\u2019t get why people insist on hugs.
