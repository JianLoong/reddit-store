This is similar to choosing a destination wedding and then turning the whole family against someone for not being able to make it. I think it\u2019s unreasonable to demand your son leave his pregnant wife at home and prioritize a birthday dinner but I apparently seem to be in the minority with that one.

The neighbor thought she'd say McDonalds or something, because in their minds, that wasn't even in the options they were considering. Should they have honored it? Maybe, but also, my sister understood when they said \"how about something else\". A lil' kindergartner, acting less dramatic than the mom here. Idk man, maybe I'm trippin'. But I sure as hell ain't offering to take any of y'all to a birthday dinner after this, lol.", "In some of the MIL stories OP is unlikable, in others they are not.", "Actually taking a birthday person to the restaurant of their choice on their birthday isn\u2019t enabling them.

Even the smells of the produce department make me feel queasy when I was pregnant. Nothing smells quite like seafood restaurant! The mom is trying to make her son choose between her and wife. So he did.", "Chef here. Cross-contamination is DEFINITELY an issue, because not every cook is sanitary to specs. Then there's the rising amount of fish with higher mercury levels.

There's many reasons why a pregnant woman should not eat there. NTA.", "Oooooh if I could not eat eggs I would be devastated. That would be hell for me.", "Your analogy makes sense but you missed the last part.\n\nIf your vegan friends want to pay for your birthday party but you are really feeling like BBQ that day, you aren't an AH for declining their offer.\n\nThe vegan friends become AHs when they proceed to get annoyed at you for being unwilling to eat vegan on your birthday and start pressuring you to change your mind.\n\nIts your birthday and you should be allowed to have whatever dinner you want. Vegan friends trying to do a nice gesture don't get to shackle you down just because they offered.", "Question: did you ask your wife if it would be ok for you to go the Birthday dinner without her? Or did you just decide that she wouldn't like it and didn't talk to her about it at all?", "Mil troll.", "YTA and your wife is loony-tunes.", "Oh God is this that troll that loves to post weird DIL/MIL drama stories?"]}
