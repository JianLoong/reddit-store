He looked like he was about to cry, but said it really hurts that we won't except his wife and he feels like everyone just saw him as a paycheck and a person to fix their problems and no one cared if he was happy. I replied that it wasn't his kids job to make him happy and cheating still isn't ok. I said I couldn't let go of the hurt of what he said and I don't get how he could even say that, drunk or not, joking or not, and I no longer feel comfortable with him walking me down the aisle.\n\nHe was clearly upset but said there wasn't much he could do. He also threw his stepson and my friend out of his house which upset me, but he is still willing to pay for the wedding so I feel like it is ok to let him pay, but my sister called me a gold digger and my future MIL said he should cut me off.

I understand that everything you\u2019ve gone through at the hands of what he has said or done (or lack thereof) probably hurts like hell. But if you don\u2019t want him in your life, you don\u2019t get his money either.

The dude just said he said that because he feels like his kids treat him as a paycheck.... which is exactly what you're proposing to do. Seriously?", "YTA\n\nDad: I feel like my kids just use me for money it would be nice if y\u2019all showed you actually cared about me \n\n\nOp: oh dad of course I\u2019m gonna use you for your money but not treat you with respect \ud83e\udd2a", "YTA. Firstly, do you ever say things you don't mean when drunk or ranting or a drunken rant. Christ I have a 4 year old girl, she's my absolute world, she's just my everything, but there are days when I've worked all day, am exhausted and she is misbehaving and pushing me that I question to myself why I had kids. People say stuff they don't mean and I think you are old enough to know that. I think you are using this as an excuse to downgrade him and punish him for his adultery and leaving your mum. Do you know the full ins and outs of the relationship? It's failing etc? Do you know how he has felt over the years? No you've just had one side of everything and the fact you cannot see by the fact he said he just felt like a piggy bank, or words to that effect, that he has felt unloved and unappreciated proves everything. How can you accept his money to pay for so much while thinking so little of him and treating him so poorly. Yeah YTA.", "YTA for still using him as a paycheck to fund your wedding.. you are literally proving his point right there", "Yep YTA. If you're going to shun him, give the man his money back. You can't have it both ways.", "If you let him pay YES YTA! Your hang ups fine. You want to be mad at him for his life choice\u2026fine. If you want to disassociate from your father you can\u2019t do it half ass. Infidelity is horrible and should NEVER be done.

It's like he is really living for the first time, but I just can't forgive the adultery or what he did to my mom.\n\nI'm not sure what cultural issues you are talking about but I come from a background where you can't get divorced recognized unless one of the parties commits adultery. \n\nSo what did he do to your mom? Did he cheat, lie to her? Try to gaslight her into thinking he wasn't cheating? Did he leave her broke and struggling? Did he abuse her? \n\nWas your mother completely blind sided by him leaving or did she know there relationship was functionally over and they were just roommates at that point? \n\nWe are often in the dark about the intricacies of our parents relationship. Especially if they handle it appropriately and keep the stress away from us as kids.\nTBH it's not our business. Parents have a responsibility to raise and care for us. They don't have to live their lives for us, especially once we are adults. \n\nObviously if he is a different person now and \"really living for the first time\", the marriage was toxic on some level. \n\nHas your mom moved on as well? Or is she bitter over what happened? Has she asked you to choose a side? \n\nCheating sucks. But no matter what, your dad didn't cheat on you. He is still trying to prioritize his relationship with you. \n\n\n>She is the only one who attended their wedding or will spend holidays with him. Well apparently he was drunk the other weekend and said something to his wife about how being a parent his so thankless and sometimes he regrets it \"or at least regrets the other ones.

Is he your dad or an ATM? \n\nYou are treating your father poorly, he has noticed and vented to his wife about it. \n\nWhat is wrong with that? \n\nYou got the information second hand by someone who overheard a conversation with his wife. And it hurt you. \n\nBut instead of recognizing why your dad might feel that way. You proceeded to act exactly as he was complaining about. Take his money but cut him out. \n\nHow are you possibly not an AH? \n\nUnless you have alot more information about your parents actual relationship that paints your dad as a monster, yeah YTA. \n\nYou don't mention anything he has done wrong as a parent. And his relationship with your mother is not his relationship with you.", "Your dad said something honest, and it hurt you because you know it is true. You clearly feel entitled to his money (as some sort of retribution for him having left your mom) without feeling the need to maintain the emotional attachment to him as a father. You are proving him right, so you really have no right to feel insulted by his comment. YWBTA if you took the money", "YWBTA. You want to treat him and the woman he loves like dog doo doo AND you want to take his money while downgrading his role at your wedding. YTA big time for even considering taking the money.", "You are 1000%. So is your friend for intruding on personal family matters. He didn't cheat on YOU. And you said he feels no one CARES about his happiness not asking you to provide. Did he fulfill his responsibilities to you, or was he picking up kids at the at the icecream shop and bringing them home to share the thing he provided for you as a father. This reaction is proof that its a thankless job he hurt mommys feeling so you hate daddy? Grow TF up.", "YTA. You'll never know what really happened between your parents. You're making decisions based on things you didn't witness or things other people told you about. Sounds like these gossips are causing you more drama than necessary. Your dad is right about being happy. He is still paying for your wedding so you'll be happy even though you don't want him walking you down the aisle. He is taking your decision better than others would. Your action will ALWAYS be remembered when your wedding comes up. People won't say it but they'll be thinking and gossiping to others about how/why you didn't let him walk you down the aisle.", "Yta. So he's not good enough to fulfill a father role in your wedding but he's good enough to be the paycheque...exactly as he told you he feels he is treated. Your father perhaps shouldn't have said what he did but he is a human being who feels pain too. The fact that you cant have any empathy sympathy for him and just treat him like a piggybank is disgusting. If you don't want to be a grownup make an effort to have a real relationship with your father then you need to stop USING him when it financially benefits you.", "He needs to cut your ass off. And leave you high and dry for your wedding.", "YTA\n\nYou're doing exactly the thing that pains your dad the most. He's just an ATM for you. You want his money, but you don't want to spend time with him or accept the woman at his side. His happiness means shit to you. All that matters is the dollars coming in. That's despicable!", "YTA\n\nYou are confirming that you see him exactly as he said. As a source of money, but not a person with feelings.", "YWBTA - if you are trying to posture yourself as being on moral high ground then you actually have to be on the moral high ground. You have a problem with his adultery but apparently not when it\u2019s an inconvenience for you. That makes you a hypocrite.", "YTA\n\nPay for your own wedding and quit using people for money you leech", "I hope he wises up and yanks the funding.  YTA", "My parents got divorced when I was 14. Reason behind it is because my mom cheated on my dad for years. Me & my siblings saw how destructive their relationship was. Despite everything negative I thought or been through or witnessed with my parents marriage, at the end of the day, I always respected both my parents. They're both happily married to other people now. \n\nYes, cheating is not okay and you feel as if it isn't his kids job to make him happy, but just remember that you don't know how much longer he has to live, or how to console him with the pain he's been feeling. \n\nYou should love & respect your dad, no matter your differences because I can't tell you how many times I've witnessed my own father almost unalive himself because he felt like none of his kids loved him or even cared the slightest bit about him.\n\nESH - your dad said something that hurt you and did say how that he feels as of he's just a paycheck to everyone & with you still thinking it's okay for him to pay for the wedding and just be a guest is kinda proving his point. But you're also putting your feelings above anyone else & sometimes you either have to be selfish or selfless when making certain decisions.", "Your parents had their problems. Should he have cheated? No.. But thats between them and there's probably alot more to it than you know about. I wouldn't like my parents saying they regret having me as a joke or while drunk,, it's just not a thing you say. But you can't just write him off but let him pay for your whole wedding. You either want him in your life or you don't. You can't have his money but not him. YTA", "ESH here. Him for saying that but seems like yall ARE treating him like that. He's okay to pay for whatever we want but we not gonna be there for him, etc. If you let him pay but downgrade him yeah you'd be a jerk and cement how he feels about being used as a bank I'd think.", "YTA Well you just proved him correct about your family simply regarding him as a paycheck, and yes you are a gold digger if you do this.", "ESH.\nYou shouldn\u2019t take his money if you don\u2019t want a relationship.\nHe has no right to be down on you and your siblings for not accepting his wife. If you want your kids to accept a new partner, don\u2019t have an affair with them behind their other parent\u2019s back. That\u2019s pretty simple. I really hate the whole \u201cadultery is ok because - HaPpInEsS\u201d mindset. An adult who thinks that way needs to grow up!", "INFO: did he cheat on your mom?", "Hm... letting him pay if he wants to isn't inherently assholish but it also gives the person paying sort of an upper hand or bargain.\n\nIf you feel like your dad's comment broke your relationship completely then you need to make the cut clean and not accept him paying in my opinion. That will take his and and everyone elses ability to question you away. Esp. since he's already wallowing in self pity about how he's just a walking wallet. Do you really want him to use your wedding as an example of this in the future? If he is just a guest, he can make a gift like everyone else. \n\nBut looking at the facts he did indeed act like a propper AH. It's okay to feel bitter about the way his relationships towards his kids developed but that wasn't just bitterness speaking. He devalued the very existence of his children in front of others and then has the gall to punish those people for telling on him. It's that last point that makes my decision.\n\nThat being said I know it's hard to cut a parent out of your life. I'm not gonna say that you absolutely need to cut him out. But neither should you let him pay or walk you down the isle for some artificial show of respect. Do what you feel is right.", "The responses here are amazing  daughter proving her fathers point and acting exactly as he described is being told how she is the victim. The disloyal people who are living free in his home back reporting on everything he says at home (where he has a reasonable expectation of privacy and not being grassed on) are the victims for biting the hand that feeds them. He is the trash because he is sad about his treatment and the hypocrisy of his children he is allowed to be sad or angry at this situation! The fact you siblings (and mil)who are not happy with your dad think you are wrong is important. He is still being a parent regardless of how terribly you react proves his love for you! It is a shame you are so petty and judgemental you can\u2019t act outside of your own self interest. At least after this his financial responsibility is complete good luck with the consequences of you choice!", "NTA, but you may wish to take a step back if you plan to have a relationship with your father in the future.  It took me years to forgive my father for cheating on my mother and blowing up our family.  Of course divorce is different for each person who experiences it, and I'm sorry for the pain you all have experienced.\n\nMy stepmother is now a valued person in my life though she was the \"other woman.\" The more I learn about my parents the more I learn that while my father shouldn't have cheated, I understand his motivations differently.  Lying to your family is not okay, but people make mistakes.  Sometimes huge mistakes that hurt others.  \n\nYou're NTA but you may want to rethink your response to him feeling like he's only a paycheck for his kids.  There's a lot of layers to both of your feelings and it may help to try to understand each other better.  Your father sounds like he can be an asshole and I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
