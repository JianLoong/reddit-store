She's a very kind girl and I had not had a bad experience with her until yesterday. I hadn't had my hair done in about 6 months so I was quite overdue for cut/color. Keep in mind that Lindsey does specialty haircuts and her rates are not cheap.\n\nSo, I walk in for my appointment yesterday and I noticed that Lindsey had her 3 month old with her. She apologized and explained that her babysitter canceled last minute and she was in a bind. She gave me the option of rescheduling but to be honest I didn't think much at the time as the baby was sleeping, plus I really needed my hair done. So I went ahead with the appointment as planned.\n\nThe problem started once her baby woke up and was fussy and cried throughout the session, making it hard for me to relax. Furthermore, she had to step out a few times, once to calm the baby down and another to change a diaper, she even left me sitting alone in the chair for about 20 minutes so that she could go feed her daughter. She wasn't nearly as focused as she usually is.\n\nBy the end of the appointment I was feeling irritated by all of the disruptions and extra noises that happened that even though I was happy with how my hair turned out I left a small tip. Mind you, the tip is on top of her usual (expensive) rate. When I gave her the tip, she asked if something was wrong and I explained that I felt like the baby was a distraction and that even though I didn't have to pay for the extra time (roughly an hour) I was unhappy with how long it took. She said that she was disappointed because she gave me the option to reschedule. I apologized and left.\n\nNot being a parent myself, I don't want to be dismissive or unsympathetic to Lindsey's situation, however, I really felt like I didn't get the experience with her that I usually pay for.

But. \n\nBeing that you\u2019re not a parent, you ARE being unsympathetic. You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to try to rush around LAST minute trying to fix a non sitter issue. Which is most likely why she didn\u2019t call you in advance to reschedule. She can only give the courtesy she\u2019s afforded by the sitter. Last minute for her means last minute for you. \n\nHow long did you wait to get this appt with her? Are you a last minute appt person or do you schedule your next appt and she\u2019s just booked 6 months out? Is she usually squeezing you in to accommodate your lack of rescheduling after your appts? Are you someone who constantly cancels and reschedules?\n\nI\u2019m asking bc those types of things should be taken in to consideration. If you are the multiple cancels and rescheduler, then you would be TA for the small tip, bc she\u2019s inconvenienced you once, where you consistently inconvenienced and taken/wasted her time. If you\u2019re not that person then I stand by NAH. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d maybe start looking for a new hairdresser. While I get why you tipped how you did, being that this is NOT usual for her and she was already having a rough & chaotic day, I do feel you could\u2019ve showed her some compassion and been more understanding. Being that you don\u2019t like children, you should\u2019ve just rescheduled and I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve comped something on that reschedule as an apology.", "YTA. She gave you the option to reschedule and you said no. Unfortunately, things happen, but you **are** being unsympathetic. I'm sure Lindsey wasn't expecting to have to care for her child during her working hours, seeing as her childcare had something come up, and in that situation, of course it would feel chaotic and unorganized. \n\nEchoing what other commenters have said, don't be surprised if her schedule is full when you go to schedule your next appointment.", "INFO: Did Lindsay reach out to you before you arrived at the salon?", "YTA. You have known her years and she gave you the opportunity to reschedule. You assumed the baby would sleep throughout the whole appointment?", "NTA. If someone is self employed and sets their own prices tipping them is absolute BS.", "As a gay male who does not have any children, nor really like them or have much interaction with them ever...I still sympathize with a hairstylist who has to bring her 3-month-old to work. Nobody wants to do that. The alternative would have been to cancel your (and all her other clients') appointments. And she probably didn't want to do that since she needs the money. So, maybe she is not living as high on the hog as you think.", "NTA. She didn't offer you the option to reschedule until you were already there. She could have called or texted as soon as she realized she'd have the kid. She was in a tough position, but she handled that badly. She wanted to get paid. It took an hour longer than normal. Tipping less than usual was reasonable.", "YTA. But you just told your hairdresser exactly who you are and how much you value her service. She's been caring for your hair for years. She explained the situation and gave you the option of dealing with it or rescheduling. You declined to reschedule AND couldn't deal with it. How dare she have a life! And especially how dare that life have any impact on your precious day. You must have had the vapors.  Did you have to lie on your fainting couch with a cold compress and a mint julip? Or maybe a week at your spa to recover.  Such a dainty little flower.\n\nShe was a perfect professional.  You're an entitled ass. Don't be surprised when she just can't fit you in when you call again. If you want your relationship to continue, send a card with double your normal tip and an appropriate gift card.", "NAH. Tips are for good service. You got poor service.", "NTA. I feel for Lindsay, but it wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and your tip reflected that. The opportunity to reschedule is pretty null when you\u2019re already there, it took an extra hour and had tons of (justified) disruptions. You still chose to tip, just less than usual which makes sense to me. Had you known in advance the baby would be there, then chose to go anyways and been irritated about it I\u2019d have a different opinion.", "That\u2019s on you. It was obviously not planned & she gave you the option. She\u2019s your long time stylist & you were \u201chappy with how my hair turned out\u201d. So what\u2019s the issue?\n\nLindsey is a Mom before she\u2019s your hairdresser. She went above & beyond to do her best to accommodate you. Do you think it was a great experience for her or her baby? Also, you don\u2019t pay for the experience. You pay for a hair cut & color.\n\nHowever you\u2019re NTA ... tipping is not required. It was just a stupid reason to not tip if that\u2019s your norm.\n\nEdit", "YTA she offered to let you reschedule and told u it was an emergency. its a baby they act like that you cant control them. like you had to understand the risks of going forward when the baby was there.", "NTA \n\nShe doesn\u2019t deserve a tip it\u2019s exactly that a TIP to her normal rate and you got unsatisfactory service.", "YTA \nIt sucks that the baby cried and disrupted your appointment, but she gave you the option to reschedule. \nShe could have cancelled your appointment altogether because she couldn\u2019t find child care. \nIf she\u2019s not hurting for clients I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you suddenly find her \u201cbooked up\u201d the next time you try and make an appointment.", "NTA. I'd be annoyed that it took longer,  I'd also be stressing even more since it was color so it could have turned out bad had it sat too long. \n\nI don't know what you mean by tipping less though,  like was it a really low tip or just less than usual? Even so I don't think you're TA. I'm a mom myself so I'm sympathetic to your stylist but she has to realize that that's not the level of service people are expecting. I do think you may end up having a harder time scheduling with her but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I also think she should have called her clients that were scheduled that day immediately upon realizing she didn't have childcare,,  before they came to the salon, as opposed to after they made the drive in.", "NTA- a tip should not be expected. If she wanted a bigger tip, she should\u2019ve focused more on your appointment", "YTA", "YTA. You should have rescheduled. Plus, she did a great job on your hair, it just took longer for her to finish the job. Even still, you could have had someone else at the hair salon do your hair.", "YTA. She gave you the option of rescheduling. You made the choice not to knowing full well her baby was there with her. \n\nThis is on you.", "I won't comment on if you are an AH, but I do think you were being short sighted. \n\n You've gone to a stylist for years, and you like her work. If her prices are as high as you say, she is likely skilled and in high demand.\n\nShe's absolutely going to remember that despite a years long relationship, the second she was in a tight spot you held it against her and punished her for it.", "Yta.", "YTA. You declined the option to reschedule. Are you so obtuse that you didn\u2019t think Lindsey would need to tend the baby while you were there? Find some compassion along with a new hairdresser because I\u2019m betting dollars to donuts Lindsey just won\u2019t be able to work you in anymore, nor should she. You are insufferable.", "She should have called you before the appointment and gave you the option to reschedule. It was really rude of her to wait for you to show up and notice the baby before she said oh do you want to reschedule? You wasted your time going to where she was... What were you supposed to do at that point? You are NTA", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine being like this to someone who has been doing a good job for years.", "YTA,  you're allowed to tip what you want, but she did give you the option to reschedule.\nHave you not been around babies? They rarely sleep through multiple hours appointments, and they would need to be fed or changed. The baby did normal baby things, which would be expected.", "YTA, she explained the problem (that was not her fault) and offered you the option of rescheduling.  You made your choice.", "YTA. She offered to reschedule, and you declined. So you accepted the possibility of inconvenience", "ESH if I were the stylist , I would\u2019ve explained the OP could keep the appointment they would probably be some interruptions to feed the baby at Cetera. I don\u2019t know that I would know how disruptive a three month old baby would be", "NTA. Lindsay still got paid with a small tip, just not as large as usual. You paid her for the haircut and the tip reflects the quality of service she provided. It\u2019s business. I understand life happens but she wasted your time and gas just having you drive to the salon if you rescheduled No matter what, a baby in a hair salon is unprofessional.\n\nLindsey should have let you know as soon as she knew she didn\u2019t have a sitter not when you got there. So you wouldn\u2019t be wasting your time and gas to get there. You should have had the option to reschedule before you got there.\n\nLindsey might not schedule you in the future, but there are other stylists out there.", "YTA and good luck finding another great stylist because I\u2019m sure she will fire you as a client \n\nShe explained the situation and offered to reschedule you", "ESH. The stylist should have rescheduled your appointment, period. When she didn't, but gave you the option, you should have  rescheduled. The fact that you didn't meant that you accepted the divided attention, so her tip shouldn't have been lesser.", "Yeah, YTA a little bit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I for sure get that it wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and rescheduling would have been a pain. All of that is valid. But this isn\u2019t some random hairdresser, right? This is someone you see regularly, and you even mentioned that you\u2019re always really satisfied with the experience. This time was a bit different, sure, but it was the ONE time in the YEARS of her working with you that something came up, and it was a situation out of Lindsay\u2019s control. The quality of the hair service itself was exactly the same, it was just that the environment was a bit hectic and unorganized. You weren\u2019t obligated to give her the same tip, or even tip at all, but personally I feel like you could have been a little more understanding of Lindsay\u2019s position since this is the first time something like this has ever happened. So, just slightly TA.", "No one is entitled to a tip but your reasons for giving her a lesser tip than you usually do has nothing to do with how well she did your hair. You still loves your hair even though it took a little bit longer. \n\nYou waited 6 months to get your hair done you should have rescheduled when she told you that her baby would be there. You can wait a little bit longer. \n\nShe probably should have called you ahead of time to give you a heads up but shit happens. \n\nYou agreed to stay even though she had her baby and you naively thought a 3 month old would sleep the entire time. That's on you. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nJust being a human being means that sometimes things come up. Shit happens! You DID have the option to reschedule and your hair still came out fine by your own admission. I understand this is a service you are paying for, but having some patience and understanding for a worker in a bind was the kinder thing to do. ESPECIALLY since you are a regular client of hers.", "YTA. I can tell you she probably felt 100x worse about it then you. A little kindness goes a long way, even if you had to deal with a few disruptions and noise. \n\nShe has a new baby and is working. Since you don\u2019t have kids, you don\u2019t understand how hard and stressful it can be. She offered to reschedule, you said no. What did you expect?!", "NTA, tipping is something you do and it\u2019s as you please. That said parents can feel some kind of way when you aren\u2019t happy about their kids being around so you should start looking for someone else to do you hair. Also, I hope you didn\u2019t take too much off, these things happen and you could have rescheduled.", "Exactly what I was gonna say! OP probably just cost herself a decent hair dresser", "My hairdresser recently decided she only wanted to work part time and has been firing clients.", "Also, OP states she was overdue for cut/color. That\u2019s probably why she didn\u2019t reschedule; it\u2019s possible OP couldn\u2019t get back in until a much later date.   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be too happy either if I were OP. It\u2019s not good service, having the appointment last over an hour longer than usual (what if OP had other plans or appointments that day? I\u2019d still be as patient as possible since the hairdresser is so good (it\u2019s hard to replace a good one!).", "Yeah, I don't understand this. OP still paid for the service. OP also still tipped. OP just didn't tip as much as she usually would have... because the service she received was less than she'd usually have gotten.\n\nOP could have rescheduled... which would have made this even more inconvenient for her and yet according to these comments she would still be expected to tip like normal.\n\nEDIT: Not to mention, I don't see how rescheduling would have been better for the hairstylist. Unless she gets tons of walk-ins, she'd have been making no money at all during that time if OP had rescheduled.", "She gave her the option to reschedule after she was already at the salon though. Op had already made room in her schedule for the appointment and driven there,  it would have ended up consuming more of her time to reschedule than to just keep her current appointment and have it take longer. Plus she would have had to wait for the stylists next opening.", "I'm sure she was huffing and puffing and making her displeasure quite clear as she sat there. I feel bad for Lindsey, she was put in a tough spot and did her best to accommodate her client all while trying to take care of her baby. I can only imagine how stressed and frazzled she felt. It is really hard to do hair or other contact services on someone who is upset with you and visibly annoyed. \n\nIt was inappropriate of her to ask about the tip, but OP just sounds so unkind and difficult. Life happens and we should try to give each other grace. Especially when you have a relationship with someone! If it starts happening all the time, that's a different situation, but one time? Just choose to be kind. Be the person who made a stressful moment for someone LESS difficult.", "She paid for the service and still left a tip. Honestly, the stylist probably still came out miles ahead. Childcare is expensive, consider \"no childcare payment\" a part of the tip.", "Idk, I kind of feel like a perfect professional would have notified her client as soon as she knew that her sitter canceled and offered a reschedule rather than waiting for the client to show up and dropping it on her then.\n\nAlso, the stylist should have informed her client that since the child is still nursing, should they wake up from their nap she may have to stop service to feed/soothe the baby. Setting expectations is what a professional would do so that their client could make an informed decision. Unfortunately, they stylist fell flat. OP doesn't have kids so she's not privy to the ins and outs of kids. If OP still gave a low tip with ALL the info, then I'd be more inclined to say she's an a-hole.\n\nBut in this specific situation, she's just not.", "OP paid the full fee and tipped! She just didn't tip as much as usual! And she only told the hairdresser why when pressed! \n\nSure, OP could have rescheduled, but she was already at the salon after clearing her schedule. This was basically a bait and switch on behalf of the hairdresser.\n\nAnd, again, OP still tipped.", "A perfect professional would have called and given the option to reschedule in advance.", "Isnt it crazy how different people think? In my brain you are totally wrong and OP is totally right. I can\u2019t even envision a scenario where I would feel otherwise except if the hair dresser was a close friend or family member.", "Rescheduling last minute is inconvenient. I as a customer could even be charged a fee for it in most cases because time is money. And depending on her hair type/what she wanted done there\u2019s a chance no one else in the store even could do her hair.\n\nEta: still she didn\u2019t handle it well and I think it\u2019s just communication issues on both sides. So ESH", "She still paid though like nobody is owed a tip lmfao.", "I wonder if up to that point she was trying to find a replacement sitter.", "I have had the same hair dresser for 15+ years .... she is actually my friend & I adore her kids. That\u2019s just my perspective of what happened with OP. Totally get that not everyone has the same experience.", "I doubt very much that the stylist would have charged a rescheduling/last minute cancellation fee in this case, and if the stylist did she would be an AH. Source: I was a stylist for 15 years", "She\u2019d already waited 6 months. Obviously getting her hair done was not a priority. It won\u2019t be an issue going forward as I bet Lindsey just won\u2019t be able to fit her in, so OP will get what she deserves. Good luck on finding another stylist she\u2019s happy with.", "Fair point", "I don't think they were saying that the stylist would charge a fee here. I think they were just pointing out that if the situation was reversed and it was the client who had an emergency and rescheduled there would likely be a fee--understandably so.\n\nAnd yet a lot of these commenters are saying \"you could have just rescheduled\" as though last minute rescheduling is not an inconvenience.", "That makes sense. And I agree that rescheduling is an inconvenience, especially last minute. This was a one-time emergency with a stylist OP has a longstanding relationship with, so I think her level of annoyance and lack of compassion comes across pretty unsympathetic and that's where the \"you could have just rescheduled\" attitudes are coming from. She made a choice and then got super crabby about it."]}
