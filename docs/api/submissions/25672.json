Keep in mind that Lindsey does specialty haircuts and her rates are not cheap.\n\nSo, I walk in for my appointment yesterday and I noticed that Lindsey had her 3 month old with her. She apologized and explained that her babysitter canceled last minute and she was in a bind. She gave me the option of rescheduling but to be honest I didn't think much at the time as the baby was sleeping, plus I really needed my hair done. So I went ahead with the appointment as planned.\n\nThe problem started once her baby woke up and was fussy and cried throughout the session, making it hard for me to relax. Furthermore, she had to step out a few times, once to calm the baby down and another to change a diaper, she even left me sitting alone in the chair for about 20 minutes so that she could go feed her daughter. She wasn't nearly as focused as she usually is.\n\nBy the end of the appointment I was feeling irritated by all of the disruptions and extra noises that happened that even though I was happy with how my hair turned out I left a small tip. Mind you, the tip is on top of her usual (expensive) rate. When I gave her the tip, she asked if something was wrong and I explained that I felt like the baby was a distraction and that even though I didn't have to pay for the extra time (roughly an hour) I was unhappy with how long it took. She said that she was disappointed because she gave me the option to reschedule. I apologized and left.\n\nNot being a parent myself, I don't want to be dismissive or unsympathetic to Lindsey's situation, however, I really felt like I didn't get the experience with her that I usually pay for.

But. \n\nBeing that you\u2019re not a parent, you ARE being unsympathetic. You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to try to rush around LAST minute trying to fix a non sitter issue. Which is most likely why she didn\u2019t call you in advance to reschedule. She can only give the courtesy she\u2019s afforded by the sitter. Last minute for her means last minute for you. \n\nHow long did you wait to get this appt with her? Are you a last minute appt person or do you schedule your next appt and she\u2019s just booked 6 months out? Is she usually squeezing you in to accommodate your lack of rescheduling after your appts? Are you someone who constantly cancels and reschedules?\n\nI\u2019m asking bc those types of things should be taken in to consideration. If you are the multiple cancels and rescheduler, then you would be TA for the small tip, bc she\u2019s inconvenienced you once, where you consistently inconvenienced and taken/wasted her time. If you\u2019re not that person then I stand by NAH. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d maybe start looking for a new hairdresser. While I get why you tipped how you did, being that this is NOT usual for her and she was already having a rough & chaotic day, I do feel you could\u2019ve showed her some compassion and been more understanding. Being that you don\u2019t like children, you should\u2019ve just rescheduled and I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve comped something on that reschedule as an apology.", "YTA. She gave you the option to reschedule and you said no. Unfortunately, things happen, but you **are** being unsympathetic. I'm sure Lindsey wasn't expecting to have to care for her child during her working hours, seeing as her childcare had something come up, and in that situation, of course it would feel chaotic and unorganized. \n\nEchoing what other commenters have said, don't be surprised if her schedule is full when you go to schedule your next appointment.", "INFO: Did Lindsay reach out to you before you arrived at the salon?", "YTA. You have known her years and she gave you the opportunity to reschedule. You assumed the baby would sleep throughout the whole appointment?", "NTA. If someone is self employed and sets their own prices tipping them is absolute BS.", "As a gay male who does not have any children, nor really like them or have much interaction with them ever...I still sympathize with a hairstylist who has to bring her 3-month-old to work. Nobody wants to do that. The alternative would have been to cancel your (and all her other clients') appointments. And she probably didn't want to do that since she needs the money. So, maybe she is not living as high on the hog as you think.", "NTA. She didn't offer you the option to reschedule until you were already there. She could have called or texted as soon as she realized she'd have the kid. She was in a tough position, but she handled that badly. She wanted to get paid. It took an hour longer than normal. Tipping less than usual was reasonable.", "YTA. But you just told your hairdresser exactly who you are and how much you value her service. She's been caring for your hair for years. She explained the situation and gave you the option of dealing with it or rescheduling. You declined to reschedule AND couldn't deal with it. How dare she have a life! And especially how dare that life have any impact on your precious day. You must have had the vapors.  Did you have to lie on your fainting couch with a cold compress and a mint julip? Or maybe a week at your spa to recover.  Such a dainty little flower.\n\nShe was a perfect professional.  You're an entitled ass. Don't be surprised when she just can't fit you in when you call again. If you want your relationship to continue, send a card with double your normal tip and an appropriate gift card.", "NAH. Tips are for good service. You got poor service.", "NTA. I feel for Lindsay, but it wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and your tip reflected that. The opportunity to reschedule is pretty null when you\u2019re already there, it took an extra hour and had tons of (justified) disruptions. You still chose to tip, just less than usual which makes sense to me. Had you known in advance the baby would be there, then chose to go anyways and been irritated about it I\u2019d have a different opinion.", "That\u2019s on you. It was obviously not planned & she gave you the option. She\u2019s your long time stylist & you were \u201chappy with how my hair turned out\u201d. So what\u2019s the issue?\n\nLindsey is a Mom before she\u2019s your hairdresser. She went above & beyond to do her best to accommodate you. Do you think it was a great experience for her or her baby? Also, you don\u2019t pay for the experience. You pay for a hair cut & color.\n\nHowever you\u2019re NTA ... tipping is not required. It was just a stupid reason to not tip if that\u2019s your norm.\n\nEdit", "YTA she offered to let you reschedule and told u it was an emergency. its a baby they act like that you cant control them. like you had to understand the risks of going forward when the baby was there.", "NTA \n\nShe doesn\u2019t deserve a tip it\u2019s exactly that a TIP to her normal rate and you got unsatisfactory service.", "YTA \nIt sucks that the baby cried and disrupted your appointment, but she gave you the option to reschedule. \nShe could have cancelled your appointment altogether because she couldn\u2019t find child care. \nIf she\u2019s not hurting for clients I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you suddenly find her \u201cbooked up\u201d the next time you try and make an appointment.", "NTA. I'd be annoyed that it took longer,  I'd also be stressing even more since it was color so it could have turned out bad had it sat too long. \n\nI don't know what you mean by tipping less though,  like was it a really low tip or just less than usual? Even so I don't think you're TA. I'm a mom myself so I'm sympathetic to your stylist but she has to realize that that's not the level of service people are expecting. I do think you may end up having a harder time scheduling with her but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I also think she should have called her clients that were scheduled that day immediately upon realizing she didn't have childcare,,  before they came to the salon, as opposed to after they made the drive in.", "NTA- a tip should not be expected. If she wanted a bigger tip, she should\u2019ve focused more on your appointment", "YTA", "YTA. You should have rescheduled. Plus, she did a great job on your hair, it just took longer for her to finish the job. Even still, you could have had someone else at the hair salon do your hair.", "YTA. She gave you the option of rescheduling. You made the choice not to knowing full well her baby was there with her. \n\nThis is on you.", "I won't comment on if you are an AH, but I do think you were being short sighted. \n\n You've gone to a stylist for years, and you like her work. If her prices are as high as you say, she is likely skilled and in high demand.\n\nShe's absolutely going to remember that despite a years long relationship, the second she was in a tight spot you held it against her and punished her for it.", "Yta.", "YTA. You declined the option to reschedule. Are you so obtuse that you didn\u2019t think Lindsey would need to tend the baby while you were there? Find some compassion along with a new hairdresser because I\u2019m betting dollars to donuts Lindsey just won\u2019t be able to work you in anymore, nor should she. You are insufferable.", "She should have called you before the appointment and gave you the option to reschedule. It was really rude of her to wait for you to show up and notice the baby before she said oh do you want to reschedule? You wasted your time going to where she was... What were you supposed to do at that point? You are NTA", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine being like this to someone who has been doing a good job for years.", "YTA,  you're allowed to tip what you want, but she did give you the option to reschedule.\nHave you not been around babies? They rarely sleep through multiple hours appointments, and they would need to be fed or changed. The baby did normal baby things, which would be expected.", "YTA, she explained the problem (that was not her fault) and offered you the option of rescheduling.  You made your choice.", "YTA. She offered to reschedule, and you declined. So you accepted the possibility of inconvenience", "ESH if I were the stylist , I would\u2019ve explained the OP could keep the appointment they would probably be some interruptions to feed the baby at Cetera. I don\u2019t know that I would know how disruptive a three month old baby would be", "NTA. Lindsay still got paid with a small tip, just not as large as usual. You paid her for the haircut and the tip reflects the quality of service she provided. It\u2019s business. I understand life happens but she wasted your time and gas just having you drive to the salon if you rescheduled No matter what, a baby in a hair salon is unprofessional.\n\nLindsey should have let you know as soon as she knew she didn\u2019t have a sitter not when you got there. So you wouldn\u2019t be wasting your time and gas to get there. You should have had the option to reschedule before you got there.\n\nLindsey might not schedule you in the future, but there are other stylists out there.", "YTA and good luck finding another great stylist because I\u2019m sure she will fire you as a client \n\nShe explained the situation and offered to reschedule you", "ESH. The stylist should have rescheduled your appointment, period. When she didn't, but gave you the option, you should have  rescheduled. The fact that you didn't meant that you accepted the divided attention, so her tip shouldn't have been lesser.", "Yeah, YTA a little bit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I for sure get that it wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience and rescheduling would have been a pain. All of that is valid. But this isn\u2019t some random hairdresser, right? This is someone you see regularly, and you even mentioned that you\u2019re always really satisfied with the experience. This time was a bit different, sure, but it was the ONE time in the YEARS of her working with you that something came up, and it was a situation out of Lindsay\u2019s control. The quality of the hair service itself was exactly the same, it was just that the environment was a bit hectic and unorganized. You weren\u2019t obligated to give her the same tip, or even tip at all, but personally I feel like you could have been a little more understanding of Lindsay\u2019s position since this is the first time something like this has ever happened. So, just slightly TA.", "No one is entitled to a tip but your reasons for giving her a lesser tip than you usually do has nothing to do with how well she did your hair. You still loves your hair even though it took a little bit longer. \n\nYou waited 6 months to get your hair done you should have rescheduled when she told you that her baby would be there. You can wait a little bit longer. \n\nShe probably should have called you ahead of time to give you a heads up but shit happens. \n\nYou agreed to stay even though she had her baby and you naively thought a 3 month old would sleep the entire time. That's on you. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nJust being a human being means that sometimes things come up. Shit happens! You DID have the option to reschedule and your hair still came out fine by your own admission. I understand this is a service you are paying for, but having some patience and understanding for a worker in a bind was the kinder thing to do. ESPECIALLY since you are a regular client of hers.", "YTA. I can tell you she probably felt 100x worse about it then you. A little kindness goes a long way, even if you had to deal with a few disruptions and noise. \n\nShe has a new baby and is working. Since you don\u2019t have kids, you don\u2019t understand how hard and stressful it can be. She offered to reschedule, you said no. What did you expect?!", "NTA, tipping is something you do and it\u2019s as you please. That said parents can feel some kind of way when you aren\u2019t happy about their kids being around so you should start looking for someone else to do you hair. Also, I hope you didn\u2019t take too much off, these things happen and you could have rescheduled.", "Exactly what I was gonna say! OP probably just cost herself a decent hair dresser", "My hairdresser recently decided she only wanted to work part time and has been firing clients.", "Also, OP states she was overdue for cut/color. That\u2019s probably why she didn\u2019t reschedule; it\u2019s possible OP couldn\u2019t get back in until a much later date.   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be too happy either if I were OP. It\u2019s not good service, having the appointment last over an hour longer than usual (what if OP had other plans or appointments that day? I\u2019d still be as patient as possible since the hairdresser is so good (it\u2019s hard to replace a good one!).", "Yeah, I don't understand this. OP still paid for the service. OP also still tipped. OP just didn't tip as much as she usually would have... because the service she received was less than she'd usually have gotten.\n\nOP could have rescheduled... which would have made this even more inconvenient for her and yet according to these comments she would still be expected to tip like normal.\n\nEDIT: Not to mention, I don't see how rescheduling would have been better for the hairstylist. Unless she gets tons of walk-ins, she'd have been making no money at all during that time if OP had rescheduled.", "She gave her the option to reschedule after she was already at the salon though. Op had already made room in her schedule for the appointment and driven there,  it would have ended up consuming more of her time to reschedule than to just keep her current appointment and have it take longer. Plus she would have had to wait for the stylists next opening.", "I'm sure she was huffing and puffing and making her displeasure quite clear as she sat there. I feel bad for Lindsey, she was put in a tough spot and did her best to accommodate her client all while trying to take care of her baby. I can only imagine how stressed and frazzled she felt. It is really hard to do hair or other contact services on someone who is upset with you and visibly annoyed. \n\nIt was inappropriate of her to ask about the tip, but OP just sounds so unkind and difficult. Life happens and we should try to give each other grace. Especially when you have a relationship with someone! If it starts happening all the time, that's a different situation, but one time? Just choose to be kind. Be the person who made a stressful moment for someone LESS difficult.", "She paid for the service and still left a tip. Honestly, the stylist probably still came out miles ahead. Childcare is expensive, consider \"no childcare payment\" a part of the tip.", "Idk, I kind of feel like a perfect professional would have notified her client as soon as she knew that her sitter canceled and offered a reschedule rather than waiting for the client to show up and dropping it on her then.\n\nAlso, the stylist should have informed her client that since the child is still nursing, should they wake up from their nap she may have to stop service to feed/soothe the baby. Setting expectations is what a professional would do so that their client could make an informed decision. Unfortunately, they stylist fell flat. OP doesn't have kids so she's not privy to the ins and outs of kids. If OP still gave a low tip with ALL the info, then I'd be more inclined to say she's an a-hole.\n\nBut in this specific situation, she's just not.", "OP paid the full fee and tipped! She just didn't tip as much as usual! And she only told the hairdresser why when pressed! \n\nSure, OP could have rescheduled, but she was already at the salon after clearing her schedule. This was basically a bait and switch on behalf of the hairdresser.\n\nAnd, again, OP still tipped.", "A perfect professional would have called and given the option to reschedule in advance.", "Isnt it crazy how different people think? In my brain you are totally wrong and OP is totally right. I can\u2019t even envision a scenario where I would feel otherwise except if the hair dresser was a close friend or family member.", "Rescheduling last minute is inconvenient. I as a customer could even be charged a fee for it in most cases because time is money. And depending on her hair type/what she wanted done there\u2019s a chance no one else in the store even could do her hair.\n\nEta: still she didn\u2019t handle it well and I think it\u2019s just communication issues on both sides. So ESH", "She still paid though like nobody is owed a tip lmfao.", "I wonder if up to that point she was trying to find a replacement sitter.", "I have had the same hair dresser for 15+ years .... she is actually my friend & I adore her kids. That\u2019s just my perspective of what happened with OP. Totally get that not everyone has the same experience.", "I doubt very much that the stylist would have charged a rescheduling/last minute cancellation fee in this case, and if the stylist did she would be an AH. Source: I was a stylist for 15 years", "She\u2019d already waited 6 months. Obviously getting her hair done was not a priority. It won\u2019t be an issue going forward as I bet Lindsey just won\u2019t be able to fit her in, so OP will get what she deserves. Good luck on finding another stylist she\u2019s happy with.", "Fair point", "I don't think they were saying that the stylist would charge a fee here. I think they were just pointing out that if the situation was reversed and it was the client who had an emergency and rescheduled there would likely be a fee--understandably so.\n\nAnd yet a lot of these commenters are saying \"you could have just rescheduled\" as though last minute rescheduling is not an inconvenience.", "That makes sense. And I agree that rescheduling is an inconvenience, especially last minute. This was a one-time emergency with a stylist OP has a longstanding relationship with, so I think her level of annoyance and lack of compassion comes across pretty unsympathetic and that's where the \"you could have just rescheduled\" attitudes are coming from. She made a choice and then got super crabby about it.", "Nice job ruining your relationship with a good stylist. She def hates you now. There\u2019s no going back.", "You lost your hair dresser dude.", "NAH but this probably was a mistake if you want a good relationship with her. She will never prioritize you over other clients now", "I am normally on the side of the childfree in most situations\u2026 you\u2019re not an a-hole, but you could have understood that your hairdresser was in a bind. \n\nYou said it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s done this\u2026 I would have understood the situation and just chalked it up to \u201cthat\u2019s life.\u201d", "YTA YTA YTA. it was a one time thing that was unavoidable. Screw your relaxation tbh, she still did her job and gave you a good cut\u2026. Very shocked at other responses here. The relaxation is nice but the end product is what matters. Would you tip less if there was a noisy or obnoxious client in the booth next to you? You had the chance to reschedule\u2026.", "You may not be an AH but you seem to need HER far more than she \u2018needs\u2019 you (what with the high demand and all).\nShe didn\u2019t cancel outright; she very well could have. *YOU* are the one who declined her alternative.", "YTA\n\nShe told you her baby would be there and offered to reschedule you.  You said it was ok.  You were happy with the haircut.  It took you longer than expected, but the final result was what you wanted.  When you said you were ok with her baby being there you accepted that there may be some distractions and it would take longer.  A 30 year old human being should understand that.  \n\nFrom her perspective she spent an hour longer than she usually would, to help another person out who had waited 6 MONTHS to get her hair cut.  She probably thought she was doing you a favor and then you gave a tiny tip.", "YTA. She does a good job. One time, she couldn't do well & you clearly punish her for it. For me, I will still tip knowing she normally does a very good job. Just a lesson for me to reschedule next time.", "YTA\n\nI'm not into kids, but I would have cut her some slack. I've been in a bind before and I appreciated those who helped. You were happy with the end result, so I don't see the problem.", "YTA for calling a grown ass career woman with a kid a *girl*.", "YTA, you\u2019re not telling us what your attitude was like during the service. i\u2019d bet my life that you were being frosty and that\u2019s what prompted her to ask, especially if you previously had a good relationship with her. you also had the chance to reschedule, which would\u2019ve sucked but then you wouldn\u2019t have had to deal with the dreaded evil baby. sounds like she was up shit creek without a paddle and you couldn\u2019t extend a little bit of compassion.", "Let\u2019s see, you come in OVERDUE by at least 3 months for a specialty cut and color\u2026.. so you were going to run over anyway than if you came in for your in between visit. \n\nSo your stylist has a bigger job than normal\u2026. \n\nShe did give you the option to reschedule. \n\nThe extra time was part her part you.  So there were baby noises.  There could have been a super loud customer.  \n\nCutting her tip that low was too far.   \n\nChildcare is a nightmare these days.  If she uses customers as childcare every cut, that\u2019s one thing. \n\nBut a one off, that\u2019s time for some grace.  Maybe a $5 less tip.  \n\nIn 6 months you will have your answer if you can\u2019t book her any more, or if you do and it\u2019s not as good of job.", "This was beyond her control. Rather than cancelling her appointment with you she came in and managed to do a good job on your hair while taking care of your child.

You didn\u2019t say what percentage you tipped - I could see knocking it down for the extra time\u2026but I\u2019d also extend some grace.  Having a 3 month old is stressful.

I\u2019m sure she was aware her baby caused a bit of disruption so the fact that she couldn\u2019t connect the two and two (your lower than normal tip) is embarrassing that she called you out on it.", "NTA. That appointment sounds like hell. Screaming baby, hour long delay, multiple interruptions that you have to sit through, 20 minutes where you\u2019re just sitting there while she goes to feed it? That\u2019s insane. I would never go back. \n\nI get it, she was in a bind, it\u2019s not her fault her babysitter canceled, but it sure as hell isn\u2019t your fault either and you\u2019re not expected to overcompensate her for that when she delivered an inferior service in the first place. The fact that you even tipped her at all is gracious of you.", "NTA. Why is she disappointed to have received a smaller tip after subpar service? I'd like for her to explain.", "Kinda. She did give you the option to reschedule. I know you really needed your hair done, but you should have rescheduled. What did you think was going to happen when the baby woke up? I don't know if she rents her booth or if the owner sets the rates, but I do know that it cost a lot to rent. You have to buy all of your own products (dyes, moose, gel, hairspray etc) plus your equipment (blowdryer and curling irons, etc). Granted, she should have called you before your appointment to let you know she had her baby.", "lmao", "plus she still tipped? just not as big as normal? i honestly think the hairdresser is t a for asking about the tip in the first place. they shouldn\u2019t be expected. op is NTA", "We don't really know when the babysitter canceled in relation to the appointment either though. For all we know, OP was the first or second appointment of the day and the babysitter canceled last minute enough that the hairdresser didn't have time to call. \n\nAnd anyone with kids knows that it's impossible to get childcare for a 3 month old- if you find someone and they bail, you're screwed.", "This exactly. NTA OP: she backed you both into a corner instead of giving you the option to reschedule by notifying you when her childcare fell through. That\u2019s unprofessional (on top of her unprofessional behaviour during the appointment), and a smaller tip is still a tip, plus you paid her high rate as well.", "Who knows how much notice there even was. If OP was the first visit of the day, there might not have been time to contact. \n\nI think the hairstylist deserves a bigger tip for not cancelling on all her appointments, which would make the OP would\u2019ve been a few weeks longer waiting to get it done", "\n\n>in order to truly have that option, the client should\u2019ve been notified in advance,\n\nyou do understand what 'last minute' means right? the stylist is not an asshole here. she did the best she could with circumstances beyond her control.", "Came here for this comment. She\u2019s being going to the hairdresser for years. She\u2019s a new mom and ONE time this happens and she gives her no slack. Zero compassion here. We\u2019re living in a time where everything has become transactional. No sense of community anymore. Honestly OP is the asshole.", "Yeah, if this happened repeatedly it would be one thing, but it's a one off.", "This.\n\nIn this situation I probably would have tipped the same (or very close to the same) but let the stylist know that in if this happens again in the future I want as much notice as possible so i can reschedule before taking the time to travel to the appointment, or reschedule my day afterwards to account for the extra time the appointment was going to take.", "100%! We all need grace and understanding sometimes.", "This exactly.", "Honestly this! Does she own the studio? How much of that fee goes to either keeping the lights on or for paying to rent the space? \n\nI\u2019m annoyed by everyone here complaining about tipping. Sorry! It\u2019s the culture we live in because nobody wants to pay a living wage!", "This. I went through multiple stylists to find my current one, and she has worked with me when I needed it, and visa versa. Heck, she let me bring in my brother\u2019s anxious dog because I asked. If she needed to bring a baby in, I would tip her just as well as usual and tolerate any baby screeching.", "OP is paying the stylist for the work done. Even if she has 10 children, she\u2019s not entitled to a tip particularly when there\u2019s a bad experience for the client.", "It's not weird at all. She probably got the same tip every appointment up to that point. Anyone would notice the sudden drop in the tip. It makes sense to ask why so you know if there is something you can improve.", "Is there a reason people tip hairdressers? I cut my own hair so I don't know the protocol but it seems greedy when they already charge so much. Aren't they setting their own rates? Shouldn't they be setting their rates to not need a tip?", "[deleted]", "The hair was done just as well as before.", "It was last minute cancellation according to OP. The best the stylist could have done was a message in the morning MAYBE, depending on what kind of notice her sitter gave her; by then your schedule has already been blocked out\u2026.", "The answer is no, based on the story OP gives.\n\n> So, I walk in for my appointment yesterday and I noticed that Lindsey had her 3 month old with her. She apologized and explained that her babysitter canceled last minute and she was in a bind.\n\nSo I don't know why you're asking this question when it's already answered.", "INFO this is a great question", "Then why is she fussy if she's got so many other clients who will tip her well. She's being greedy.", "I'm sure she wouldn't have comped anything if she's being so stingy over a LOWER tip. She's very inconsiderate to not even notify op before she got there. How did op waste her time, she got paid what she's owed in the end.", "She needs a new stylist bc I doubt that stylist will take OP again. She\u2019s probably busy enough that she can cut clients.", "She already drove there, put away time for this appointment. Why would she cancel? And waste even more of her time? And then OP says she's a high demand stylist so why would she reschedule when that could be weeks or months from now? Especially when OP said her hair was already overdue.", "The hairstylist knew she gave a subpar experience though, and she should\u2019ve offered OP a discount. At that point she could\u2019ve expected a normal tip, but she shouldn\u2019t expect to earn the same amount she would for a top notch experience when she knows that isn\u2019t what the client received.", "It was insanely unprofessional to not give a heads up about the situation before she drove all the way over there and got put in an awkward position to decide. I would be pissed if this happened to me as i take pto hours for my hair appointments. Id be so mad id someone decided to waste my pto instead of just sending a text before hand", "Hairstylist. Not a surgeon. There's plenty of them. I would absolutely not go back after this experience.", "This is exactly my opinion. You have supposedly had great experiences with his person for years - accept that this was one-time bad luck and tip her anyway in recognition of that", "That really depends on the time of the appointment. If OP was Lindsey's first appointment of the day, there might not have been time to call, especially if she was having to scramble around to try and find last minute childcare.", "The offer of rescheduling AFTER someone actually turns up is BS. It's catching them by surprise and taking advantage of sunk cost. \n\nIt's why bait and switch advertising is against the law. \n\nBecause people already spent time and money to turn up, they are under pressure to proceed and it is thus considered extremely unethical and often illegal.", "That's what I was thinking. I would never be dumb enough to ruin a relationship with an in demand stylist over something so trivial.", "And she didn\u2019t give a good service\u2026 she should be apologizing for it and she still got a tip\u2026 i work in the beauty industry\u2026 i would have even given her a discount rate", "That\u2019s what I was thinking\u2026every 6 months? Shit.", "I'm struggling to understand why a self-employed stylist would prefer a cancelation over a fully-paid service plus a non-exorbitant tip.\n\nShe would prefer to make zero money for the time?\n\nNTA.", "The hairstylist knew she gave a subpar experience though, and she should\u2019ve offered OP a discount.

That\u2019s easier said than done. Maybe she doesn\u2019t have any family around. Maybe all her friends work the same hours as her. Maybe she doesn\u2019t have anyone to be a backup. We moved to a new city right before my husband deployed. I literally had no one there. Not to mention - her baby is 3 months old. I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t just leave a baby that young with just anyone (ie: acquaintance). I\u2019ve known people whose babies have died due to positional asphyxiation while in childcare.\n\nSo kudos to you, but don\u2019t judge others for their situation.", "oh yeah, when I reduced my hours after I had a baby there were the clients I kept and the ones I was not sorry to have to let go. The ones who were difficult, demanding, chronic cancelers, bye Felicias.", "Mine stopped the whole \u201ctip\u201d thing and only charges hourly. It\u2019s kinda cool not to have to worry about it anymore hahaha.", "I know with my hairdresser if it\u2019s been a certain amount of time since your last appointment she charges the full rate as if you were getting it done for the first time, and not just the touch ups for the roots.  Adds about $120 to the cost.", "She asked about the tip because it was noticeable it was a lot lower and she wanted to know what was wrong.", "Even if it was 5 minutes beforehand, at a minimum, the hair stylist should not have expected the same level of tipping.", "Exactly, and the stylist could have completely cancelled on her.", "Agree with this take. Good stylists are hard to come by and being a new parent is temporary and takes a while to figure out. \n\nSeems foolish for OP to burn a bridge over this.", "Paying someone for a service is a literal transaction.

In most places that I've been that do specialty services, the stylist is free to set their own rate at whatever they feel is appropriate to cover their time, expenses, and expertise. \n\nIf you're at Great Clips or whatever, then sure. Tip your stylist. If you're at a salon where the person doing your hair is setting their own prices, then tips are optional on top of whatever they are charging.", "Was OP happy with her hair? That\u2019s what I\u2019m tipping for. I don\u2019t tip (or not) based on my interaction.", "if you're happy with the results, its hardly a 'bad experience'. op is just lacking in empathy. shit happens. a one time issue is not worth getting so upset over.", "Please, it was hardly a bad experience.  Maybe not the best appointment but she could have been more empathetic towards the stylist.", "I mean\u2026 it also shows the hair dresser lacks any level of introspection because I would immediately know that the tip was lower because of the exorbitantly longer session and having to deal stupid fucking kid during what many people view as a luxury /relaxing service. \n\nLike this would be like having a fussy baby that your masseurs have to stop frequently and pay attention to. The hair dresser honestly should have comped the entire appointment after she ruined it with her inability to think critically and not have a child there. \n\nAnd i say this as someone who has been going to the same hair dresser for years and she works in her kitchen and her 3 girls one of whom has a learning disability that makes her needy are always there and talking to us and stuff. I don\u2019t mind because I know that\u2019s the deal and it always has been, but if I went to someone that didn\u2019t have that set up and wasn\u2019t working out of their house I would be so pissed off. \n\nCan\u2019t stand parents who make the rest of the world deal with their decisions to reproduce and inability to get childcare after  and then get offended when people aren\u2019tTHRILLED to deal with their kids (edit to add: for the record I love kids, they don\u2019t know better and it\u2019s hard out here so I give kids lots of leeway, parents though are the most selfish and self centered group of people I\u2019ve ever encountered.)\n\n(This is the most hilariously volatile post in terms of up and down votes\u2026 +5 to -3 to +6 to - 2 \ud83d\ude02 y\u2019all are opinionated)", "Except the stylist knows DAMN WELL why the experience was subpar this time. Obviously.", "She didn't do the same job though. She took longer, and there were multiple interruptions. She should have just canceled.

I can\u2019t help but wonder if Lindsay wasn\u2019t trying to put OP on the spot by waiting until she arrived.", "Yeah, me neither. The stylist knows she gave a bad service and should have been even apologizing.", "There\u2019s also tons of surgeons lol", "Even a 15 minute heads up would have been better than waiting till you walk in the door. She had to know at least 15 minutes ahead of time because she had to drive to the salon and everything.", "Absolutely!!\n\nEspecially since OP goes so infrequently. She could\u2019ve just let it go.", "Why so many downvotes? \nAs an independent stylist that bends over backwards for my clients, who absolutely adore\u2026 I feel for Lindsey. Plus, I\u2019m also expecting my first child\u2026 I hope this situation doesn\u2019t ever happen, but I\u2019m sure things will come up! Grace from individuals goes a long way, especially from people who sit in my chair and have been with me for years. The people who spill their heart out, laugh, cry, and have full trust in me-it never goes unnoticed or unappreciated. \nI\u2019d be truly devastated loosing a client// not taking back a client who couldn\u2019t give me grace at a time where life roles change. Being your Own boss + a MOM(obv this fills #1spot), yeah, I\u2019m sure it takes time to balance\u2026. That be a hard but firm goodbye to that client", "Regardless of right or wrong, it\u2019ll come back to bite her in the ass. Hair styles are in demand, and not being kind on this unusual situation means she likely won\u2019t be afforded consideration when she needs to reschedule, or cancel, or whatever. I tip and I tip well everywhere, and have a smile for everyone serving me. You know who knows my name, knows my orders, and goes above and beyond every single time for me? The people I treat with *more* respect than is strictly necessary. It\u2019s like a tiny touch of karma in my every day life.", "See I think different then you bc I\u2019m in a form of service. \n\nPeople are paying for the knowledge of speciality cuts and color, that\u2019s why they\u2019re so expensive. The level of training and education that has been put into it. If someone doesn\u2019t like that (bc OP repeatedly mention its expensive), then they can go to hair cuttery and get a novice right out of school and pray they get what they want. It\u2019s Not expensive bc of the actual experience. The experience is just to make it better.\n\nAlso, this is a one off for her hairstylist. Being last minute, with a 3 month old, she most likely was trying to remember and pack everything. Calling clients to warn them would be a last thought. It would be different if babysitter cancelled the night before. In my opinion. \n\nAlso is OP a multiple offender of canceling and rescheduling. Bc that would need to be taken into account too. Being that she said she was \u201coverdue\u201d leads me to believe she\u2019s either a sometimer who books last minute or she\u2019s a canceler and rescheduled. Let\u2019s say hypothetically she is. Which at that point she is TA for low tipping. A lot of time she takes away from another client being in the hairdressers book bc of canceling and yet can\u2019t make an exception for a one off of the child being there? \n\nThere\u2019s so many factors and at the end of the day, while tipping is not required, it was a one off and I feel OP should\u2019ve just rescheduled knowing she doesn\u2019t like children.", "When a standard service takes 2-4 hours and you are unexpectedly delayed by an hour, that constitutes poor service. \n\nIf the delay was 5-10 minutes, then whatever, but an hour delay for a haircut and styling is not within the realm of good service.", "She told me it was easy to figure out which ones to let go and doesn\u2019t regret it", "That makes sense when you\u2019re self-employed and set your own rates and hours. I used to have a hair dresser come to my home and she straight up told me no tips.", "$120 extra?  I pay that for a full head of foils, wow.", "Wouldn\u2019t the reason have been obvious though?", "obviously? i\u2019m saying she shouldn\u2019t have.", "Exactly! How do you have a crying baby at the appointment and then \u201cpikachu face\u201d when the tip isn\u2019t the same?!", "I feel that the hair dresser should have been the one to offer her a small discount for the inconvenience and taking up an extra hour of her time!", "Yeah I feel like most of the NTAs are people who go to Supercuts.  I've been with my stylist for 12 years.  Life happens and he is human.  It's just hair, and we work it out.\n\nAnd I say that as someone who maintains specific hair for my job", "Yeah, a good stylist is difficult to find, and sometimes you just need to give people some slack as life happens to the best of us. OP is an unsympathetic AH.", "If the bridge is burned it's not her fault. She STILL tipped the stylist, even though she was being inconvenienced. Yet somehow she's in the wrong... right.", "Your take is exactly why I withheld my judgement. Because you're right, it was a subpar experience that earned a subpar tip.\n\nBut people aren't machines, and I think her choice is ultimately just shooting herself in the foot.", "Exactly. It's a two way street. Tips for a service are for that service and that service only. It should not be expected for the case of poor service. \n\nIf your pizza delivery guy's car breaks down and it arrives 2 hours late, he's gonna get zero tip, which OP didn't even do. She still tipped. \n\nDoes he complain? Nope. He rolls with it because he knows he fucked up. Sure it's out of his control but it still resulted in poor service. \n\nSo why should the stylist be treated differently?", "Just depends on who needs the relationship more. From the fact that OP had to wait 6 months, I\u2019m guessing the hair stylist is more in demand. She can probably drop a few clients and still be booked solid. OP probably lost a good stylist and the only person suffering will be OP. They stylist will be fine with kinder clients.", "I doubt she's going to get another appointment", "The hairstylist knew she gave a subpar experience though, and she should\u2019ve offered OP a discount. At that point she could\u2019ve expected a normal tip, but she shouldn\u2019t expect to earn the same amount she would for a top notch experience when she knows that isn\u2019t what the client received.", "I think the voting makes it clear that that's not true for many people, myself included.  The experience is definitely a part of what I'm paying for (examples: they're on the phone the whole time, taking much longer to complete the appointment, unpleasant situation if it's in their home). In fact, if I get a good cut and color but the person is unpleasant or on the phone the whole time or something, I'm much less likely to tip as well as I do for an attentive stylist who creates a good atmosphere.\n\nI'm not paying to be your bff.  OP is being understanding as OP kept the appointment and seems to be considering coming back.  It's asking a lot more than understanding to think you're entitled to the same level of tip.", "Not a bad experience ?  In what world ?", "I don't even know how to respond to this. I mean... just... wow. Wow.", "Tell me you don't have kids wo telling me you don't have kids. Or have been around a child. Your lack of empathy is gross.", "That all hangs on what kind of notice the sitter gave her, which is info we simply do not have", "I fully agree, a warning would have been nice. I'm just wondering if getting one was possible. I am not a hairstylist, so I don't know how the booking system/contacting clients usually works--do stylists normally have clients phone numbers/permission to contact them outside of working hours?", "Right? This sub can be wild. Say \"Be kind\" and everyone flips out. lol \n\nCongratulations on your baby! You sound exactly like I was with my clients. If it helps, the vast majority of my clients were wonderful and so supportive and kind with advice and even gifts when I had my boys. You will be an amazing mom and I hope the transition is as easy as possible!\\]", "Sure but she could have said in a message \"Hey just a heads up, I'm gonna work with my baby, do you wanna reschedule?\" \n\nShe never told her, Op showed up and got a surprise, its unprofessional of her to not say anything before hand, don't defend incompetence. She already wasted resources for it to be rescheduled and since the stylist is so \"high demand\" god knows how long it would take for Op to go again. Op's time and money is just as valuable as the stylist.", "Agree 100%. I know I\u2019m in the minority, but I would have given her a larger tip than normal. Do people seriously think she wanted to deal with having a 3 month old around while working?? The poor woman was probably frazzled as hell and still managed to produce a great haircut/style in spite of it. I give her credit for that.", "But OP did pay for the knowledge of specialty cuts and colour and the level of training and education that was put into it.  She paid it with the fee. \n\nThe reduced tip was a reflection of the reduced service.  In addition to the haircut, people also go to the salon for self- care, to relax and have a little care and attention given to you, maybe even have a little chat.  I feel like that is the service covered by the tip. The skill is covered by the fee.", "Maybe! But in situations where I've not had childcare, I'm still letting whatever appointments/plans know what's going on especially if the alternative is going to mean I'm having to bring my child to work, where I am engaging one on one with a customer, with an infant, who is breastfed and will almost definitely need my attention for an unspecified amount of time at some point during that client servicing.", "It really is! Doing hair is really a pretty intimate relationship, especially when you have long term clients. I watched my clients' kids grow up and in many cases did their hair through school and off to college! I had clients who brought in their babies for first haircuts and I'm still connected on FB and get to see their prom and \"leaving for college\" pics. I listened as they talked about work stresses and losing parents, and planned weddings and graduation parties. It's one of the only non-medical jobs where you touch people. And when someone comes to you for a long time but treats you poorly by being unpleasant, not respecting your time, or otherwise just being a pill, you notice. I would have felt terrible for impacting my client's day like that, but I would ALSO feel pretty hurt and angry that someone I had this good relationship with for so long couldn't give me grace in an emergency. And I'm not even talking about the tip.", "I mean, people should still ask for constructive criticism. You can\u2019t know what to do better if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. That is why the stylist asked if something was wrong. The tip only came into play cause that was the only indicator that OP possibly didn\u2019t have a pleasant experience.", "I actually wouldn't come back just from having her ask about it.  Things happen, that's fine, but acting all shocked about the tip was pretty rude.", "My hair stylist retired and I looked like the Berries and Cream lad for ages until I was able to find someone to replace her. \n\nI would not risk losing a quality trades person because they're struggling a bit as a new parent. That 0-6 month stage is rough.", "They tipped less than usual. They didn't do anything extreme, they don't need to cut the hairdresser any additional slack. OP didn't even complain until asked from what I can tell.", "Sure, it might not be her\"fault\" but she still has to deal with the very real possibility of her stylist prioritizing other clients in future.  \n\nGood stylists that work well with your hair can be hard to come by.", "The tip isn't even the issue for me, it's her attitude.", "Yeah, if I were treated like the OP, where the stylist expects full price plus tip for a stressful and overlong experience I wouldn\u2019t have tipped at all. I would pay full price plus usual high tip **if** I were offered a discount or something else to make up for it (IOW I don\u2019t need to *actually* receive the thing, just the offer) but the stylist\u2019s conduct here was frankly disrespectful.", "Because she has build a relationship with this stylist over years and every other appointment has been great. She\u2019s a new mom and this was a last minute error. OP said she was happy with the hair. Ya\u2019ll are savage.", "Really short sighted. Good stylists are typically solidly booked. The stylist can fire OP and have plenty of clients. OP is going to have a hard time finding someone else that does her hair the way she likes. So technically you are right, but the only person who loses is OP.", "she walked away happy with the results of her appointment.", "Yeah I don\u2019t have empathy for people making poor choices and then forcing all of us to deal with it.", "I don\u2019t disagree with you on that. But OP does as she kept going on about the cut/color itself being expensive. \n\nAs far as the experience, I don\u2019t feel bad for her. She was given the chance to reschedule, she chose not to, KNOWING she doesn\u2019t like kids. She was already going in with a bad taste in her mouth. Some people who don\u2019t like kids are very unsympathetic to people who do have them. \n\n(I say that as a person who does not have children.

I feel badly for Lindsey that OP didn't reschedule or have empathy with someone who she had such a long relationship who is also a new mother and needed a little grace that day. Yikes. Like service people are people too.", "She did nothing wrong so she's not the foolish one. If the stylist wants to fire OP as a client because she didn't tip as much even though the stylist knows the experience wasnt worthy of that tip, then I'm sure OP can find better.", "What attitude? She didn't complain until the hairdresser specifically asked her about it.", "She asked if she was the asshole for not tipping well. And what's wrong with her attitude? She feels like her time was wasted which is was.", "Exactly how I am. If I have an issue with an experience I don\u2019t want to get out of paying or anything like that. I want to feel heard and acknowledged and respected. I want them to understand that my time is also valuable. If every they have insisted on a discount or comped meal (be it from a wait or they got the order wrong) we have always just tipped way way higher because we felt valued and that kind of service is what we care about.", "Actually, paying for a service and giving a tip that\u2019s just not as generous as usual is about the least savage thing you could possibly do. You know how many people would be demanding a discount for service that took an additional hour?", "And she's tipped well for every other appointment. \n\nHappy with the hair = pay for haircut. \n\nHappy with the service = pay for tip. \n\nIf the food is good but your waiter service is crap, do you tip the waiter well?", "I mean, this wasn\u2019t a poor choice. She had childcare and they canceled last minute. There literally wasn\u2019t anything else she could do.

If you provide subpar service, you get tipped less. It's really no different with restaurants. If you have a waitress who vanishes after taking your order and never refills your drink, you're not going to tip as much as you would for excellent service, irrespective of how good the food was. You're paying for the food, but tipping for the service.

The fact that the stylist did not immediately do so constitutes a distinct lack of professionalism.", "She tipped for poor service. How is that a low thing to do?

That doesn't warrant a top-notch tip.", "She's tipping for the service she received, and not tipping the stylist for being a mother.

It was really sad, I went to hair school with her so I\u2019ve known her personally for a decade and she was always fantastic. When she returned to work it was like she just didn\u2019t care anymore and no matter how I described what I wanted or what pictures I showed her, she just kept giving me the same style and using the same technique that I no longer wanted. I had two appointments in two months and spent about a grand, which I\u2019ve never had to do with her ever, and my hair still looked nowhere near what I asked for. She basically refused to admit that there was any issue, and I refused to have hair that I don\u2019t like, so I went to another girl that I knew and she gave me what I wanted in one appointment and actually scheduled enough time to accomplish it. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, I really miss seeing her and catching up. Maybe she was trying to get rid of me in order to thin out her book, I don\u2019t know, but we never had any issues until then and I really tried to be understanding.", "You Americans and tipping are out of control!", "Decent or not I doubt anyone would want to relive that experience. There\u2019s many expensive decent hairdressers", "No, if anything the hairdresser cost herself a customer.", "She deserves it.", "She'll find another one. The hairdresser lost a client and would lose many more if she always has to bring in her kid. We go to hairdresser to relax, not to listen to some brat crying...", "Wasn\u2019t she informed upon arriving while having already scheduled an appointment? \n\nI don\u2019t think this situation is equivalent to your example.

Tipping a hair stylist at all is already pushing the limit of reason - they aren\u2019t waitstaff that are paid criminally low wages without tips. 20% on a service that already cost well over $100 when the person performing the service is already receiving a sizable portion of that base cost is insane. But we feel pressured to do it. The fact that this woman called OP out to shame her is gross.", "A hairdresser relationship is more personal than most business transactions.  Maybe even the closest.  Some people refuse to change hairdressers or barbers for years.\n\nAnd the stylist might not have wanted to cancel since that could disappoint op a lot.  In the end, she gave a choice, and the finished product was great.\n\nThe kind of personal level of service/relationship you have with your stylist should be worth one awkward appointment. \n\nThat said, I don't think I'd call op an asshole, as \"less tip for a job that wasn't as enjoyable\" is fair enough, but I do think it was a stupid move.", "OP also says they weren't charged for any extra time.

The sitter did not drop the baby off at the salon for crying out loud", "She knew when she came in with baby in tow that day that she was going to have the baby with her. Telling the client AT the appointment isn't giving them the option. Telling them before they drive over, park and walk in is giving advanced notification.", "No, the best she could do with the circumstances is offer her a discount. She doesn't *have* to do that, but the bare minimum is to disregard what the tip amount is because she should *know* the service was sub-par for the money paid.\n\nThe stylist is the asshole here. Having a child doesn't invalidate any wrong you do.", "\u201cIf\u201d and \u201c might\u201d is what you are basing your comment on. There is a lot of gray area there\n\nMy comment was based on the fact of truly having the \u201coption\u201c of rescheduling, some notice needs to have been given. Whether or not that notice was absolutely available is another argument. To me showing up and giving the \u201coption\u201c is really no option at all. At that point, it is a time suck and a losing situation", "It's interesting how different people from the US see tips compared to a lot of the world. Like for me a tip is for exceptional service, the base rate (which OP said is already high) should be enough reward for the job. And there simply was no exceptional service this time. She still paid the regular fee AND a small tip, even though you could say that the 'product' wasn't worth the high base rate this time.\n\nYou're saying everything became transactional and there's no sense of community, I don't disagree with that but this could have come from both sides right? Since it was clearly a bother to have the baby there, the stylist could also have reduced her fee a little bit, instead of acting entitled about not getting the usual good tip.", "Clearly I\u2019m going against the grain\u2026 maybe they\u2019ve built a relationship while chatting/doing hair, but they still have a professional relationship. It sounds like OP isn\u2019t getting any discounts like a friend would and they met because the stylist started doing her hair. \n\nShe\u2019s still a full paying customer and probably following salon/stylist rules about canceling\u2026 she is a customer and at any other job this would be considered unprofessional. \n\nI think it\u2019s weird and unprofessional to even ask about the tip. What if op didn\u2019t have enough money this time around to tip generously? How is that okay to ask? \n\nOP still paid her\u2026 Didn\u2019t get upset or give the stylist any issue during the appointment.

The service at the time:", "Agreed 100%. OP was a major YTA. Can\u2019t believe all the NTA votes. This is somebody she has an established working relationship ship with for YEARS. The stylist explained the situation and gave her the option to reschedule. OP said she was just as happy as always with the result of her hair. Everything has become so transactional like you said. The you don\u2019t owe another person anything attitude. My friends and I talk a lot about this shift and how somehow America is becoming even more individualistic than it\u2019s always been. No compassion, no slack for anyone or anything.", "If you ever tip X amount of money for good service, tipping less than X is a \"punishment\". Wow.\n\nPeople acting like tips for a fancy hairdresser with high rates are as essential as tips for servers who would make minimum wage without them.", "Yep, so many people commenting things like, \u201cWhy do you have to tip? If she needs more money, why doesn\u2019t she just charge more?\u201d\n\nBecause tipping is the norm in our culture! Professionals who charge a 20% higher base price than everyone else in their area are going to be booked way less often.", "She also charged OP her full rate. If I was OP, I'd probably tip a bit less, but I wouldn't have changed my tip so significantly if I hadn't been charged the full rate for the stylist's issue.\n\nAt the spas I've worked at, both as a provider and front desk, if something happened that was the beauty therapist's fault, they might offer an additional service (free hand scrub, aromatherapy, a sample of a product they love, an extra 10 min if there was time, etc: something small, but nice) or a discount or something to make up for whatever happened.... At least, the providers that I respected would do that.\n\nWe've had people bring in their kids, but usually they're older and will sit quietly. It's a non-issue. Bringing in your baby who  begins howling and you have to go nurse during the client's time? That's an issue. It seems like the provider should have canceled her day instead of offering the client to reschedule if she didn't want to offer anything to make up for the baby crying. We also had someone who was consistently calling out due to not having a baby-sitter for her baby. That was becoming an issue, my boss was very, very gracious towards her, and there was even one time where she brought in the baby and my boss (who has brilliant kids of her own) offered to watch the baby while she was in session, because this client had been canceled on one or two times already. If it's consistent, that's a problem. If the stylist has a one-off day and doesn't call off all the time? There should be no issue rescheduling all her clients as soon as she realizes she can't get a new sitter.", "We tip EVERYTHING nowadays. I paid for a massage at a place that\u2019s also a place for medical massages and they asked about a tip. Lol", "Hair stylists pay the salon for the chair and pay for the products. So the fee is part using the chair, part product and part their time/expertise. They do get a chunk of the fee the client pays but then the tip is all for them.\n\nI couldn't tell you any kind of exact numbers or percentages but that's the general breakdown I'm aware of from stylist friends.", "Lots of places charge rent for a hairdressers chair and they also have to pay for supplies. It's not guaranteed big money. I don't know about hairstylists but almost every esthetician I've had do my eyebrows quits because they barely make enough money to cover their rent. I always tip them 100%.", "I'm a barber, and personally I keep my rates low because a lot of my clients are on Social Security/seniors with a fixed income or just want a basic haircut that takes 15-20 minutes. I don't expect a tip but tipping does make up a good chunk of my income I can make anywhere from an extra $2-$10 a haircut if not more. If I had to charge more for my time a lot of my clients wouldn't be able to come in and take care of themselves. Even with my prices so low it's still a stretch for them. \n\nTo me the only time I'm insulted when someone doesn't tip is if they come in asking for a 45-minute haircut that a different shop/barber would charge them $45-60 for. Only because it puts me behind for my other clients and they don't appricate the work I put in. I started to charge more for these cuts now just because most of the people who want longer cuts like that don't tip at all and demand so much. To me it's still frustrating when people want something more complex and then don't appricate a good price when we both know someone will charge them 2 or 3 times the amount somewhere else.\n\nI'm never going to get mad at an old man who comes in and only tips me $2 or $3 though because I know they are on a fixed income.\n\nOn the flip side I have a lot of clients who come in from areas with a higher cost of living hand me the normal amount they would pay there (with tip) and leave. I personally love these clients because they give me double what I'm charging in a tip out of their own personal principle.", "Because it\u2019s a service, tipping is customary. I\u2019ve heard that if a stylist owns their own salon then they may say \u201cno tips,\u201d but usually they work in a salon with many others and the rate is set by the owner, who also gets a cut (no pun intended).", "Exactly. Poor girl is a new mom and OP would deserve it if the girl decides to stop seeing her. She has no compassion or sympathy for a new mom still trying to get her footing.", "Nowhere does it say she was \u201cstingy\u201d about the tip. It sounds like she inquired about the tip to suss out whether there was something wrong with the cut and color, which seems like a normal interaction if there was a noticeable difference in the tipped amount.", "You\u2019re not sure bc you don\u2019t know how the business works. MOST people in the business will try to find a way to compensate a client. \n\nAlso, she\u2019s a NEW mom. She most likely was more worried about making sure she had everything for her child. I realize this is super hard for some people to understand, but even people in the service industry are HUMAN and sometimes, there are other priorities (like making sure there\u2019s enough diapers for a whole day) than the client.\n\nEspecially when clients consistently cancel/no show and waste service industry people\u2019s time that could\u2019ve been filled with someone who would show.

It is so obvious to anyone what the issue is. \n\nIt's not like she *didn't* tip either (Which already sounds insane to me since I come from Australia, why are things so bad that hairdressers are asking for tips too???), she just gave a smaller tip. \n\nShe also sprung the whole baby thing on her when she walked in, at the last minute. That is after she's already taken time out of her day to drive there, keep the time slot open and just in general having to deal with the fact that a part of her day is taken up by this. That's besides the fact that it's already been a long time and she's due for her next session. Rescheduling is likely to push it even further behind. That is a lot of opportunity cost taken that is now completely wasted if she has to drive back and then figure out what to do now.\n\nIf the babysitter cancelled last minute, the bare minimum the hairdresser should've done is offer a discount for the trouble. Or just don't ask about the tip! You're already getting an amount above the service you've rendered.", "This woman should have put two and two together. And, she should have just rescheduled the appointment, honestly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my child care fell through, here\u2019s a partial credit toward your next appointment, let\u2019s find a good date\u201d etc. \n\nHaving her baby there ended up making doing her job professionally impossible. And that should have been damn obvious and she should not have bothered OP about the tip amount. But it\u2019s entirely possible she knew OP would feel guilty about it and maybe leave extra cash or tip extra next time.", "I totally get what you\u2019re saying; however, I don\u2019t feel that her offering to reschedule really counts after OP already blocked a chunk of time out of her day, used up gas to drive there, etc. just to be offered to reschedule when she\u2019s already at the salon? I\u2019m sure some clients have childcare they arranged just so they can make it to their appointment. So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to reschedule at that point. I feel for the hairdresser completely, life happens. But she should have graciously accepted the tip that was given to her without asking for further elaboration. \n\nTime is money, and when she kept her client an extra hour I still think she should have offered a little something to acknowledge that she inconvenienced op. Again - what if OP had kids to get home to and had to pay the baby sitter for an extra hour? It was just inconsiderate and tacky to ask about the tip.", "I once canceled on my hair dresser last minute, because my cat decided to blow his asshole out right as I was about to leave. I paid the cancellation fee because she has a business to run and my cat\u2019s bowel movements aren\u2019t her problem lol", "She could have given her no tip at all and she still wouldn\u2019t be wrong, get off your high horse.", "Goodness. That high horse you\u2019re on is a little ridiculous. They paid full price and gave a *slightly lowered* tip. OP wasn\u2019t proselytizing a childfree lifestyle while insisting on a lowered rate.", "Hairstylists can be so professionally immature. It\u2019s probably the most frustrating group of professionals I have to interact with professionally and personally. Navigating their world of entitlement and petty grievances is exhausting. It\u2019s why I learned how to my own hair.", "It\u2019s VERY unlikely OP would have been charged extra for the time for her actual hair growth; 6 months is not two years, it\u2019s not that much more work.  \u201cwell, I disappeared for like an hour but you had an extra quarter inch of roots that took me an extra five minutes maybe to deal with so that\u2019s equal\u201d", "Couldn't the stylist also have thought \"here is a customer I've built a relationship with over years \" and maybe given an at least token discount just to acknowledge the inconvenience OP had to face? Her appointment went on a full hour longer than scheduled. What if she had had a date or an important meeting to do to?", "And that company he works for would probably refund you and send a free pizza.", "He doesn't expect a tip though, which is the issue here. \n\nThe stylist expects it.", "If she keeps treating people like that she ain't gonna have to worry about having plenty of clients, that's for sure. \n\nThink about it, it's not one mistake.\n\nIt's:\n\n1. Not informing OP beforehand about the problem until she turned up, having spent time and money\n\n2. The \"offer\" of rescheduling AFTER she showed\n\n3. No real understanding of the clients time, making her wait. \n\n4. Then guilt tripping re the refused crappy offer of \"rescheduling\"\n\n5. Getting offended she didn't get a full tip for a service that took a whole hour more than expected. \n \nMost people would be beyond pissed and leave ZERO tip if they experienced just half of this.", "She's happy with the cut, not the service. So she paid full price for the cut, and left a smaller tip for the poor service. \n\nIf I'm a waiter and toss your plate of Michelin star food onto your table and bang the cutlery down, would you give me a full tip just because the food was good?", "OP SELF IDENTIFIED as FEMALE in her post.\n\n\"(30f)\"\n\nWhat do you think the f stands for? \n\nFwomen? Silent F? \n\nPlease do not keep trying to correct me.", "Understanding cuts both ways. \n\nBarber should have offered a discount if she wanted to preserve the relationship. \n\nIt's not just up to OP to be understanding here, when she is the one who let OP down with poor service.", "YES!", "Exactly. An option to reschedule or any relevant information about the appointment should be provided well in advance, not when the client is already there.", "Sounds like it didn\u2019t make her job impossible though as op says her hair looked just as good as it always does. That doesn\u2019t sound like an impossible job to me", "OP loved their result, yet decided on a punitive action which was lowering the tip, the only part of the transaction that she could control. What's understood doesn't necessarily need to be said out loud. The stylist knows why she got a lower tip.", "If she\u2019s as good of a stylist as OP makes her out to be, it\u2019s OP\u2019s loss, not hers. She\u2019ll have no trouble finding clients with more empathy, but OP will probably struggle to find one that does as good of a job. Good stylists are hard to find. Clients are everywhere if you\u2019re halfway decent.", "It is possible to be gracious even when offered the opportunity to air your grievances. The OP knew her stylist had a baby with her under what were obviously extraordinary circumstances. \n\nOP could just have been\u2026 nice? Maybe tried to make her stylist\u2019s complicated day a little better? Why choose the alternative?", "It's usually considered a color correction if you go that long between coloring.", "Extra 1/4 inch of roots? Lol.\n\nA normal touchup is every 6-8 weeks. 6 months is at least 3 times the coverage as a normal touchup job, and she's getting a specialty job done, so you can bet your ass she would normally be charged more for 3 times the product and the extra time it takes to colour it.", "Ding ding ding. This is exactly what most people would do. And it's still understandable. If I schedule an hour for a haircut and it takes two I'm gonna be PISSED. \n\nRanked from least asshole to most asshole: Small tip > no tip > refusing to pay full price for the cut. \n\nOP picked the least arsehole option there is.", "I mean\u2026 I wait 6 months for appointments for my stylist. It\u2019s really hard to find someone good. OP says she\u2019s really expensive and very good. Just from experience, good stylists are really hard to get appointments with and have a lot of clients. Ymmv.", "Offering to reschedule when OP already arrived is like OP showing up to her appointment and asking if she can reschedule. It\u2019s not professional. Clients usually have to give 24-48 hour notice, or are charged a fee for cancelling last minute. So, in this situation, she should have offered to reschedule or offered a slightly lower rate, equivalent to a cancellation fee.", "I can read, thanks.\n\nYou specifically said \u201ca female\u201d and \u201creferred to another female\u201d [stop referring to women as females](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-should-you-stop-referring-women-females-sacha-de-klerk)\n\n[Since you need it explained to you why calling women \u201cgirls\u201d is bad](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2021/08/09/why-calling-women-girls-is-a-bigger-deal-than-you-may-think/?sh=7e8b1e782fda)\n\nGoogle is free [[.]](https://www.insidehook.com/article/advice/why-you-shouldnt-refer-adult-women-girls/amp) [[.]](https://medium.com/illuminations-mirror/men-why-you-should-call-us-women-not-females-or-girls-8148918b7b80)", "Yeah the haircut was possible, but it was impossible to be professional.", "OP loved the result and disliked the *experience.* The baby was crying, stylist not as attentive, and it took an hour too long. All of those things go into a calculation of tip amount.", "For hairdressers, especially ones that charge their worth, a tip is truly a gratuity for a job well done. Even if the cut is good, leaving OP alone for long stretches and taking up an extra hour of time is poor service, so it\u2019s not a job well done. \n\nThe stylist needs to suck that up this one time. OP has historically been a good tipper for good service. OP didn\u2019t not tip and didn\u2019t try to negotiate a discount; she\u2019s fine and the stylist should have handled it all more professionally.", "To me, the stylist\u2019s attitude was far more egregious. To put OP through that and then dare to be like \u201comg what happened to my usual tip\u201d?? \n\nThe stylist earns a lot already and still got tipped. If OP didn\u2019t want to pay the usual extra due to the appointment being subpar, that\u2019s something a stylist should expect. The first time the stylist had to abandon OP, she should have immediately offered a break in price for the inconvenience. That\u2019s what a professional would do if they were unable to provide professional service. I would be MORTIFIED if I had to keep leaving my client and would have been grateful to even have gotten a tip. Maybe the tip would have been normal or even extra if the stylist hadn\u2019t just been like \u201cwelp brb again \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d", "I keep thinking about the fact that her baby is only three months old. That is not an easy time to be a mom, and it sounds like she did all she could. I kind of consider my stylist a friend, at least I feel loyal to her. If the cut was great and OP wasn\u2019t late for something else I don\u2019t see why she didn\u2019t just tip her normal. That said - I do understand making a decision about tipping that you question later, and maybe that happened here. She did apologize so probable felt kind of bad. I think NAH and I hope they can be good for the next appointment.", "Imagine the goodwill the stylist could have earned by acknowledging taking an extra hour and giving OP a discount for the inconvenience that the stylist caused. Wow.", "In my experience, people who are willing to pay for really expensive things are willing to pay because of the service rather than the product. \n\nThat's why fancy hotels and restaurants bend over backwards for their clients. They know it's not the product that differentiates them, but the service. \n\nRich people would be incredibly offended by the complete lack of respect shown for their time, not tip at all and never return. \n\nThe stylist got off easy with a smaller tip IMO.", "So you linked an article that discusses why people shouldn't call certain specific persons under a self identified category (save myself a lot of trouble and further angry responses) as \"girls\". It all boils down to feelings within the article and the perceived nature of the word.\n\nBut in this context, the hairdresser is probably (unlikely) to see this specific post and as a result get upset over being referred to as girl. It has happened in previous Reddit posts where people referred to have stumbled across the post randomly but we're picking at extremes here. \n\nSince it all boils down to feelings, why does it matter on the internet where everyone is anonymous and peoples genders are revealed through their own cognitive decisions and and are generally not revealed by anyone else? In that same instance, you can refer to me as a woman, a female, a girl, a boy, a lad, a man, a pensioner, a grandma, I wouldn't care. That's the beauty of being anonymous online.That's my own personal view. \n\nIn that same context. If an anonymous poster makes an anonymous post about a situation that could well and truly be made up. Then in that same post, the word \"girl\" was used to refer to another person under a self-identified category. Do you really think it's that big of a deal to kick up a fuss about it? I can't see the seediness behind it in this context. I wouldn't care if a male poster had referred to another guy as \"lad\", it's not something I generally get upset over.", "Tipping entitlement has gotten fucking out of control.\n\nImagine having a job where you set the prices and how much you make per transaction, and still have the gall to confront a paying customer over a tip not being big enough. You're not a waitress making 2.13 an hour. If you think your time is worth more the CHARGE MORE.\n\nEnough with this emotional blackmail", "> and it sounds like she did all she could.\n\nWhy no discount for the trouble? Why no offers/incentives for the trouble? A lot of services offer these when something on their end inconveniences the customer.", "Exactly. But instead of doing that she expected even more money. Somehow OP is the one with the bad attitude tho", "What do you mean by \u201can extra hour?\u201d Sometimes my haircut takes 25 minutes. Other times it takes 45. This happens for a variety of reasons. Should I be demanding a discount for my inconvenience every time it\u2019s not completed in the minimum time possible? \n\nSome of you just need to be honest that you\u2019re cheapskates who are always looking for a reason to demand something of someone, even if it requires damaging relationship with someone trusted.

In this case, you have absolutely zero right to decide what is a \u201cbig deal\u201d in terms of how women are treated or spoken about.

Correct?\n\nIf it holds the same amount of weight then whoever wants to DISCUSS it can do so. Why are you asking if I am a man?"]}
