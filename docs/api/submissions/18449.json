Hailey pre-gamed for it by pounding High Noons before the car ride over.\n\nWe were all doing our fair share of drinking before the dinner and during the dinner.\n\nMy mom at one point, looks at Hailey( who'd probably had 5 glasses of wine by this point) & I and asks how we're doing.

Frankly, that's not something many parents would be happy about.  Your mom was trying to be polite and civil, and your wife went off the deep end.  That girl had some balls to tell your mom \"fuck you\" at her own dinner table in her own house.  If I were you mom, the wife would not be welcome in my house for a looooooong as time and after a very sincere apology.\n\nYou sat there like a bump on a log and let your wife disrespect your mom.  Would you have acted the same if your mom disrespected your wife?  I'm betting not.\n\nMaybe your mother and wife did need to address the situation.  But it didn't need to happen when it did, where it did, or when your wife was half in the bag on alcohol.", "YTA.

This didn't need to happen. What needed to happen was a sober, open conversation. No one needed to cuss at your mother, especially when she was at least trying to be nice.

Don't be surprised if they ask you to stay away from them. Your wife is the problem here.", "YTA and so is Hailey. What did your mother did that was inappropriate? She asked how you guys were doing.

Nobody talks to my mother that way. Not drunk, sober, mad, whatever. Completely unprovoked none the less. If it bothers you that your mother doesn\u2019t approve of your marriage, then stop going over there, but you don\u2019t get to have it both ways.

You guys went for dinner, there was NO need for pre-gaming, and you know it. The fact that you didn\u2019t stand up for your fam brings you into AH territory. Imagine if your sister was dating a guy like Hailey. (Oof)\n\nIf the roles were reversed, would Hailey be okay with you pre-gaming and going to her parents\u2019 house for dinner, drunk? AND cussing them out? Congrats you married an AH, and are turning into one.", "I gotta go with YTA as well as your wife is TA. Yeah your family might not approve if your marriage (you\u2019re young and got married fast). But they still have you over and your mom seemed to ask such an innocuous question. Even with disapproval normally from her, she may be trying to come around to the situation. It took my in laws years to come around but they did.

With all the drinking you said you guys did I hope you or your wife was actually sober enough to drive home.", "YTA and your wife.\n\nSeems like she was spoiling for a fight before she even got there.

You two clearly aren\u2019t mature enough to be married and if I was your mom I wouldn\u2019t have been thrilled about the marriage either.", "So you got married in less than a year and got drunk before, and continued to get drunk at a family dinner. Your wife says fuck you to your mother, while you sit there twiddling your thumbs? Then you drive home intoxicated?\n\nWhat in the actual hell, man. You and your wife are the biggest assholes.", "YTA. Your family didn't want you to get married at your age because people in their early 20s are (generally) hot messes as demonstrated by this story. If your family has beef with your wife or marriage, it's up to YOU, as a husband, to intervene and mediate. And don't drive after drinking!", "ESH \n\nYou should buy communication books and study. You know very little about the basics of healthy communication. \n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t drink that much either. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get alcohol poisoning and throw up. There is something wrong if you are drinking that much.", "ESH - that is, you and Hailey. You suck for sitting back and claiming 'this needs to happen', when drunken blowups never 'need' to happen; she sucks for getting so completely hammered for a family gathering. Both of you need to grow up and learn how to communicate like adults.", "ESH except your family.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are definitely not mature enough to be married if she has to pound drinks in the car (illegal) to deal with a family gathering and you said nothing. She also sucks for being immediately standoffish and aggressive and continuing to drink heavily and you said nothing. Your wife has a drinking problem and you have no spine. I don't blame your family for not loving your marriage.", "YTA and your wife is out of line, it sounds like your mum was right.", "YTA big time. Your wife was rude and immature. There was no need for that. If I was you OP, I\u2019m letting you know now she\u2019s trying to isolate you from your whole family and you was only dating her for five months that\u2019s a red flag. If I was you, I would get a divorce and work on rebuilding my relationship with my family.", "ESH (aka you and wife) except your mother and sister. Yes except your mother, she did nothing wrong in the dinner and got attacked by your wife out of nowhere. Well you picked sides and you picked the wrong one in this case. Let that woman isolate you from everyone because apparently that's her plan. You will end up isolated from your whole family.\nAlso, I want to add that your mother is right to not want this insolent and no manners woman in the family.", "What the hell is this?  ESH y'all belong on Jerry Springer.", "You and your wife are the AH here. There was no need to get so defensive towards a simple question. Makes you an even bigger AH is that you drove home after all that drinking", "If my husband ever uttered such disrespect to my mom\u2026.it would be on! YTA so is your drunk wife", "YTA and your wife is a even bigger asshole. your mother's doubts about you two getting married at 21 with just 5 months of dating is totally understandable and you just demonstrated that you are not responsible and functional adults.\nYour wife reaction is totally out of line, if she can't behave in a perfectly normal social situation she should seek professional help; I highly doubt that your mother views will change after such a disrespectful answer.\nMoreover: being so drunk without a reason is outright ridiculous.", "YTA. So if your wife. I was kinda on your side at first but your mom is actually right about this marriage. Your wife is acting like a child. Your mom actually did make an effort to ask how it\u2019s going. That would have been an opportunity to make progress and be civil.", "YTA, you and your wife. Not just for your behavior with your mum (her mil) but also for the drunk driving.", "YTA: Who pregames to meet their in- laws?    Yes the at is immature like hell.  Hailey need to learn normal healthy communication, how to behave in social  situations and also not drink so much.  \n\nWould you be ok if your child  partner  had the same   attitude as Hailey????  \n\n\nI hope you Uber home and didnt do drunk driving, because that is horrible.  Have you any idea how it is to lose friend  due to  drunk driving?  I do.", "YTA, but your wife is even worse. She has also given your family another reason to dislike her; she's a nasty drunk.", "ESH. Hailey drinks too much, your mom and the rest of your family are behaving terribly about your marriage, and you actively encouraged a drunken family fight.\n\nAll of you need to grow up.", "YTA. \n\nYou guys are the AH for pregaming for a family dinner, just leave early if you don\u2019t enjoy spending time with your family. Or just be an adult and say you don\u2019t want to go. Also the AH for letting your drunk wife attack your family in their home, there\u2019s no need for any argument. You all need to sit down, establish boundaries and be clear as adults what your feelings are. \n\nBUT in the same thought your family is the AH as well imo. Only for being so disapproving of your relationship for so long. Sure the first few months of being married but holding on for this long? They definitely need to get over it and accept that you\u2019re an adult and this was your choice to make. \n\nI would really recommend not attending family events for awhile, until you and your wife can mature up and realize drinking & starting fights is NOT the proper way to deal with your differences. If your family can\u2019t accept your marriage, then move on and limit contact because this was your decision to marry young.", "ESH.", "Why the rush to get married? Everyone I knew at 21 was still in college and having fun. Who the fuck wants in-laws at this stage of life? Haha", "YTA for making your wife deal with these people in the first place. If the situation is so bad that she has to get drunk before she even gets there, she should never have been forced in to it. It seems like your mom probably deserves it, but it was messed up to put your wife in that position in the first place. \n\nYour wife is now your priority. You tell your mother, in no uncertain terms, that you are married and your wife is now your first concern. If your mother cannot respect the both of you and your decisions, then she will no longer get to see or speak to you. Then you follow through. You don't visit or accept any non-emergency calls until she gets the stick out of her ass. If you talk to her and she starts in, you immediately tell her you are hanging up and then hang up. You are a grown ass man, your mommy doesn't get to control you anymore and if she cannot respect that, cut her off. Or don't,  and end up divorced. Your choice.", "Nta I think its built up from how everyone has treated her constantly.", "NTA sometimes Dutch courage is needed but YOU needed to have told you family that your wife is who you chose either support you both or back off!", "NTA\n\nYour mom definitely is.

Everyone was intoxicated and that\u2019s how you wife responded to your mother\u2019s question? Yeah, a conversation needs to be had, however I think you and your wife need to grow tf up first. Who the hell *pregames* family dinner with alcohol seltzers? Who just sit back and lets their wife talk to their mom like a rando in a bar? Are you kidding me?

I was 20, my husband was 24, it was a year from dating to engaged to married. We\u2019ve been together a decade now. I\u2019m not going to shit on you for that but\u2014your wife seems too immature to be in a serious relationship let alone a marriage. *OF COURSE* no parent is going to be thrilled with their kids getting married in such a short time frame! I don\u2019t know how our parents held it together when my husband and I did and and that was a year! Y\u2019all both need to get your heads out of your asses and realize that your parents have waaaayyyyy more experience being married than you do and if they\u2019re not jumping for joy it\u2019s because they realize there are very real trials that await you and they\u2019re worried about what you\u2019ll go through when they come. Every parent wants to protect their child. You\u2019re old enough to be married so your wood enough to understand where your parents are coming from. They already know where you\u2019re coming from, they\u2019ve been in the infatuated stage too.\n\nYour wife owes your mom a huge freaking apology and you do too.

Your wife had more than recommended in a whole week for one quiet family dinner.  Then your wife was wasted and verbally abused your mother at her own table.

This outburst is going to be used as an excuse to justify the mothers non-supportive behaviour prior instead of acknowledging that her non-supportive behaviour triggered the response. If someone keeps poking at you you\u2019re one day going to get annoyed.

And vice versa, what are your wife grievances about your mother? Are any of those legitimate one way or the other?\nBecause the way I see it you are painting it like a you problem, it seems you have a mother used to get her own way to whom you didn't develop healthy boundaries and was used to trample over you. And then you suddenly married a person with too little time knowing each other to establish healthy boundaries and tramples over you too.\nWhat kind of relationship do you want with people? Because the mistake began when you decided it was a good idea to drive your half drunk wife because she wouldn't stand the idea of seeing your family sober. Think for yourself! Grow a spine! Are you willing to tolerate shitshow family event after shitshow family event?\nDo you plan on having kids? Are you comfortable with your wife badmouthing your mother in front of them and vice Versa? Ask yourself all the difficult questions. Go see a therapist if you need to but you better unravel your shit fast because your wife and your mother won't get along, and if you want some semblance of civility I'm sorry to tell you but you'll have to put on your big boy pants \ud83d\udc56 and start putting boundaries by yourself.\nYTA - this event is just the tip of the iceberg", "It needed to happen? What does that mean?", "YTA. You both are. One, that kind of drinking is dangerous.

You said everyone had a substantial amount of wine. One of you drove home, presumably. Don't drive drunk again. You are lucky nobody got hurt and it would've been 100% on you if it had.\n2. Any parent in their right mind would have concerns about their 21 year old marrying another 21 year old after a 5 month courtship.\n3. Your mom seems to have a point about your maturity levels. It's not your fault, your brains aren't done cooking yet and you're just acting your age.

YTA.", "INFO - By whirlwind did you mean blackout drunk all the time?", "\"Needs to happen\"? WTF? No, drunken attacks on your mom don't \"need to happen.\" If your mom really is that bad, you don't go there.

I mean JFC. Eh, I think leaving was probably the best thing to do (by Uber maybe though). I mean, this specific situation only but doesn\u2019t seem there was a reason to pick a fight. Are you the asshole for not stepping in? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really go in for the whole husband should stop wives behavior thing or whatever and you seemed to support her doing it.

On one hand there's moral obligations, setting boundaries, on the other - I'm convinced it's not your fault and you are being played.\n\nYou are essentially wearing two masks at once. Which both makes you TA and not TA and it keeps on shifting the more I think about it.\n\nHow is your relationship with your wife outside of this situation? Have you noticed anything unusual about her on a behavioral level? Are any of these observations confirmed by what your mother said?\n\nYour wife did start the conversation with open agression. That's the point you should have acted, as bringing her into the family made keeping peace your responsibility. She then proceeded to escalate, I assume because she was met with the opinion of a person who was not entrained by her. This cold shower broke through her entitled persona, and the child underneath ended up making her leave - dragging you with her.\n\nI'm mostly concerned about the whirlwind, lovebombing romance - with fast marriage and all at a young age. Your wife's lack of respect for your mother is also concerning, as it could be a sign of badly developed boundaries. Your wife appears to have literally not seen (re-specio) your mom, but some other object in her place, prompting her reaction. The substance abuse also lines up with my line of thinking, especially as it led to the development of a contumatious self-state.\n\nI just want to state that this isn't a diagnosis or anything - so if you find what I'm saying interesting, speak to a professional. I don't think your wife's behaviour here was normal. You don't have to agree with your mother or follow anything she says - but you could at least say you are sorry and acknowledge the facts. It will help her see clearly too.

It's like she wants to prove your mom right.  You honestly should have called an Uber to remove her from the situation. \n\nDriving home was the cherry on top.

And they weren\u2019t all newlyweds: it just recorded age when married for all the couples.", "u/silverfairy5 \\-  sorry  everyone  is  jumping  on  you  for  your  generalization.  I  got  married  to  my  husband  at  24.  We've  been  together  almost  21  years,  married  for  14,  love  eachother  fiercely,  and  I  will  unequivocally say  24  is  too  young  to  get  married  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  We  are  vastly  different  people  than  we  were  at  24,  and  find  ourselves  incredibly  lucky  to  have  grown  together  rather  than  apart  because  of  how  different  we  are  now  vs  when  we  were  younger.  Some  people  get  lucky,  like  us,  but  the  numbers  (and  research)  don\u2019t  lie  on  how  unsuccessful  young  marriages  like  ours  are.  Despite  every  informal  fallacy  (ie  personal  experience  like  mine  and  others  below),  compelling  evidence  shows  these  marriages  are  statistically more  likely  to  end  in  divorce.", "My parents got married when they were 19 and 21 after only three weeks of dating and have been married for 55 years so. \ud83e\udd37 So really age and how long they have known each other is really not the issue.", "I was a lot older, with 3 kids, when I met and married my 2nd husband after 6 months of dating. We're coming up on 15 years soon. \n\nI also met his kids before we dated, they were in same grades at school. Even knew his ex and her parents. So I often tell him I married him because I liked his kids \ud83d\ude06 \n\nI've an amazing husband, even though we have our moments, he's always front and center when I really, really need him.", "Where do you live? In the US it\u2019s used often in college-life/young adulthood. I went to high school, college, and grad school in three different areas of the country and they all used the term pregame", "I\u2019m really surprised you\u2019ve never heard of this phrase before. I first heard it in film or tv. Easy to pregame before going out so you\u2019re not wasting so much money on drinks to wherever you\u2019re actually going or before whatever event/gathering. It\u2019s not like you have to drink heavy before said outing but I use it sometimes to loosen up if I\u2019m possibly going around people I don\u2019t know really or to save money lol. My friends and I will usually take some bottles and leave them in the car outside of the bar so we can pregame inbetween bar hopping or leave out to take some shots while there.", "Based on his post he said he was drinking.", "Pre-gaming was popular on the jersey shore. \"Cabs are here!\" was a popular thing for people to say. We all did take cabs out. You don't pre-game and then drive. It's the only show I can think of at the moment that shows people pre-gaming. It was popular to do in college because we were all poor students.", "In the U.K. it\u2019s called pre-drinking which makes it very self explanatory \ud83e\udd23", "In movies and TV shows with alcohol, there are house parties with free alcohol (also unrealistic at a young age where party attenders are usually expected to bring some alcohol to contribute to the party stash since it can be hard to acquire alcohol underage, and is expensive if you're 21-25).\n\nIt's kind of like how you never really see actors brushing their teeth, working out, etc.. These are things people do, but they just don't show up in media sometimes.", "I\u2019m honestly shocked you haven\u2019t heard about it. I\u2019ve been hearing that term for the past 15 years", "I'm guessing his mother doesn't approve because Hailey is the sort of person who arrives at family dinner drunk off her ass and then gets even drunker, and responds to polite conversation by being unbelievably rude. \n\nShe's basically feral. I don't know anyone who wants their kid marrying that.", "Please know that based on OP's own comments, OP's mom did nothing wrong. Hailey's just mad that she doesn't vocally approve of the marriage. That's it. She got drunk off her ass and started a fight to prove her MIL right I guess.", "Of course it depends on the people involved, but like I mentioned majority people shouldn\u2019t marry that young. Making it work at that age in today\u2019s times is more an exception than rule.", "Nice, we just celebrated 22yrs.. We were junior high sweethearts.. I've never even kissed another man as we were 12 years old when we started dating..", "I was 20 and my wife was 18 when we got married after dating for 2 years. We'll be celebrating our 39th this year.  Some people are more mature than others. All my siblings who were older when they got married have been divorced at least once.", "Ehh, there's a difference between marrying at 21 after dating 5 years and doing so after dating 5 months. It's not so much the age at the marriage as it is the age of the relationship that matters.", "My aunt and uncle got married after 2 weeks of knowing each other. They were married for over 50 years before he passed away.", "Congratulations!!!", "It probably worked out because you guys sound super mature! It\u2019s something to be admired and something I wish for myself! Congratulations :)", "So my point is that the maturity your parents had at that age vs the maturity the most people have today at the same age is different. Again I realise this is a generalised statement and I apologise if it\u2019s coming off as judgemental, this has just been my experience. It doesn\u2019t have to be true for everyone", "TIL booze hasn't always been 21 in the US", "In the UK we say pre drinking, pre drinks, or more rarely \"prinks\"", "Nah, I've been pre-gaming since y'all were kids.  Even then we took the name from tail-gaters who were drinking before they went into sports stadiums where the drinks got expensive.", "Weird, where are you from?  I was a 90s kid and pregamed for years and years through late high school and college and into my first few years of work for sure.  It was always in context of \"drinks will be too expensive so drink the cheap vodka at home and get a buzz so you don't need to buy a much there\".  I'm canadian though and alcohol prevalence was high in the Civil engineering programs at university.", "I learned it from my first college roommate, which would have been 1995.", "I was a college student in the late 80s/ early 90s, and we used \"pre-party\" and \"pre- gaming\" all the time.", "The first time I heard it was in the late 90\u2019s from a friend on the east coast. Def wasn\u2019t really in use at my college on the west coast. So, it might have been regional for a while.", "I think I first heard around when elaborate cocktails got more popular and drinks got really expensive.  So you\u2019d drink some at home first. Like 2010 ish.", "I agree. I was 22 and my husband had just turned 24 when we got married in 1992 after having dated for a year (mostly long distance). We'll be married 31 years in July. \n\nStill....those were different times. People seemed to grow up a bit faster, possibly because we were out in the real world more than young people are today. IDK...maybe it was just my group of friends, but every one of my friends in college either had worked during high school or were working their way through college. Most had been given quite a lot of responsibility at young ages. And, of course, we didn't have the distraction and poor influence of social media. (Don't get me wrong....I was not immune to doing stupid things at that age. I had far too much fun in college, for sure. However, I knew where certain boundaries were and never would have shown up drunk to a family event and proceeded to purposely start an argument or cause a scene.)\n\nAnyway, as happy as we have been, marriage is hard....harder when you're so very young and immature (like the OP and his wife). Whenever I'm asked about getting married, I advise young people to wait and enjoy their 20s. It's a great time of life to explore yourself and the world, to grow up and know who you really are before committing to someone else. There's no reason to rush into marriage. I really hope the OP and his wife don't have children right away....I cannot see this relationship lasting.", "It's also not a federal law. What the federal law is that states that have it at 21 or higher receive federal funding for highway maintenance. But, you know, it's 100% up to each state", "There was a time when it was 99+.", "It was 19 in my state when my mom was young.", "It was 18 when I was that age. The reasoning being - we were drafting men of that age, and sending them to Vietnam. They  could vote, why not drink?", "Never heard \"prinks\"", "Yup! I know it from people tailgating at stadiums", "In England we were doing this in the 1970s, it just didnt have a name.  We would down a bottle of wine before we went to clubs because it was too expensive to buy drinks inside.  Once inside, we stuck to soft (cheaper) drinks lol", "We used it in the late 80s in the Midwest. A lot, lol.", "Louisiana was the last holdout.", "Isn\u2019t a federal act a law though?", "My mom was 20 when Michigan switched over to 21. Two years of legal drinking taken away lol", "I think there'd be riots in the UK if they tried raising it from 18 lol", "Yeah I hate the term, it makes me cringe", "Back before the internet when we had to wait for a cousin to visit to learn the slang from somewhere else. \ud83e\udd23", "Why does this not surprise me in the least", "Yes, but what I'm saying is that *technically* it's not a federal law that the minimum drinking age has to be 21. Realistically it is, but not *technically*. And stuff like this is why people hate politicians and lawyers.", "The point is that the actual federal law doesn\u2019t set the drinking age, it sets a highway funds distribution limit. Based on how states set their drinking age. \n\nWhich I suppose that money loss could be part of an alcohol tax to offset it. But no state currently does that. \n\nSo it\u2019s \u201ctechnically\u201d a choice. If you want to be the pothole and drunk teens governor.", "Love a glass of poo at prinks!!"]}
