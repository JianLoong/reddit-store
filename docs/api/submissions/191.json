She knew him because I introduced them to each other on discord about a year ago, they barely know anything about each other but sometimes say hey. \n\nIssak messaged her saying that his boyfriend had a tumor and needed surgery, and said he would be offline for a while. She responded with \"I'll be praying for him.\" \nA day later, he broke the news that his boyfriend died during surgery, and he was taking a break off discord for even longer than he first intended. \n\nFast forward about a week later, and I get a message from a friend of mine, Ly. \nShe says that Bri had asked how issak was feeling, a fairly normal question that I had no issue with answering. I told her that issak was doing better, that he wasn't crying anymore, and was starting to come back to his normal happy self. Ly then tells me all the things that Bri asks. She started asking for very personal details about the boyfriend's death. (When, how, what did his parents say, what did his family think, ect) I answered all except the last one, since I didn't know myself.\n\nAnother week goes by, and Ly says that Bri asked again, how issak was feeling. I answer her, but then feel rage in my blood. I start ranting to Ly that Bri shouldn't have asked about the boyfriend's death, considering her and the boyfriend had never spoken, and the boyfriend didn't even know Bri existed. \nThe only connection they had, was Issak and sometimes me. \nI sent a message to bri's number, stating that what she asked was none of her business ect. \n\nAm I the asshole here for telling her this?

There is nothing wrong with asking.  But basic answers will suffice.  \"He's doing as best as can be expected\" is short and sweet.  No details need to be given.  Or \"I'm not comfortable talking about it right now\" will shut them down.  People who are grieving a loss need to have their privacy protected.  It's really no one else's business to know anything more.", "YTA, for the way you went about it.

I just got angry at how many details she wanted. She had no connection to anyone else in my family and didn't have a connection to me, at least not anymore. The previous argument was simple and I got over that quickly.", "Yeah, they had no connection to the boyfriend who died, and asked for VERY specific details, even things I didn't have answers to. She was always nosey from the whole year we used to be friends, but this was just a bit much to me. \n\nAlso, we're all in middle school, she really had no right to ask for the details.", "I know she was concerned, but she shouldn't ask for so many personal details about someones death that she didn't even know.", "But you never told her you didn't feel comfortable, so how do you know it wouldn't have?", "Based on what you have said you never told Bri you were uncomfortable.", "Just reference any other YTA judgements, I agree with them all.\n\nAlso, as a bonus you are an asshole for breaking the rules.

That's one of the reasons we're not friends anymore, she doesn't respect boundaries.", "Dude did you even read it? \n\n\"She started asking for details about the boyfriend's death. (When, how, what did his parents say ect) \"", "What do you mean dictate others feelings?? She literally knew NOTHING about my cousin's boyfriend, never spoken to him, only knew him by name and that he was my cousin's boyfriend, she didn't even know what he looked like, and overall, NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER. how am I dictating others feelings by telling her not to ask about personal details about his death?!", "Alright quick lesson in setting boundaries. If someone asks an invasive question, you can just not answer that. If they continue asking, you can say \"that's not your business. If you keep asking, I will block you.\" And then block them. If they ask in person, you can say, \"I've told you I'm not answering that\" and walk away. It may feel mean to you, but it's not. It's being firm in the face of rudeness.", "I missed that part, but even so, Y(still)TA, especially with some of your responses on these comments."]}
