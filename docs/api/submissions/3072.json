If they were in a last minute pinch, I would obviously be okay to help them, but I don\u2019t really want to be childcare. \n\nI have horses, a dog, and parrots that I spend a lot of time looking after, and I asked her how she\u2019d feel if I expected her to clean up after them and feed them for me.

For an aunt without kids of her own and no particular interest in them I'd pin that at after they're solidly toilet trained, not before they support the weight of their own head.

I wonder how all of your lives will be when you're old, with no human contact or anyone to care about you?

How \u2018bout time she grew out of being entitled?", "NTA, good for you for not pussyfooting around and thus getting more and more babysitting requests. You told them where you stand and rightfully so. Sideline auntie sounds fine!", "Obviously you are NTA.  What an entitled SIL.", "You are the one being rude and selfish? Is not you the one trying to pawn their responsibility to other people! The audacity of your brother and SIL is astounding.\n\nNTA, but you're gonna need firmer boundaries, I'm afraid.", "NTA\n\nPSH. What she was excited for is free babysitting.", "NTA maybe you should change your reply to \u201cI could but I can\u2019t guarantee you will get back your baby in one piece!\u201d Or \u201cI have politely told you no, why do you keep pushing this?\u201d\n\nTalk or write to your brother, tell him the whole conversation, tell him you will still spoil your nephew on his birthday & holidays.... but you will never watch him! Remind your brother that you love your nephew despite not babysitting him! \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fsome women hate kids but love their child..... still if you don\u2019t want kids; don\u2019t have kids. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">said that she can\u2019t wait for me to start fulfilling my \u201cauntie\u201d roles.\n\nNTA. They can't decide what your obligations or \"roles\" are just because **they** decided to become parents, you're your own person with your own life.\n\nI made it clear as soon as my sister said I \"was going to be an uncle\" that I would not be a present one, I never signed up for anything like that.", "NTA. One of the joys of having niblings is that you get to decide how involved you'll be. I have a teenage niece who I love to take out a few times a year, and two toddler nephews who I won't take until they're potty trained. I see them at family gatherings throughout the year, but that's it (and I only live 45 minutes from them). My partner and I are the fun relatives, but that's because we can be because we are childless and know our limits for being around kids.", "NTA, you can\u2019t force a relationship your not interested in. Kids aren\u2019t for everyone", "NTA. I\u2019m cynical enough to think that Kelly\u2019s primary goal was to get you to agree to watch the baby so that she\u2019ll have guaranteed breaks.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: She is judging you and is refusing to recognize you as an adult because you won\u2019t commit to a life path with kids.\n\nHowever, if she were primarily focused on being judgmental and sexist toward you, she wouldn\u2019t have led with taking her kid out. She\u2019s annoyed because she was banking on the baby meaning that she could shift childcare responsibilities onto you. Your refusal to adhere to her expectation of an aunt means that she can\u2019t hoist the baby onto you whenever she wants a break from parenting.", "NTA the only one being selfish is your SIL", "NTA. You stated your point politely, and you were pushed into stating them more vehemently. What do you know, feelings got hurt, because she didn't listen the first time.", "\u201cInvolved\u201d what does that actually mean?\nFree babysitting?\nAnd if you do not want to look after a baby- you should not have to. It is very hard to look after babies\u2026it\u2019s not a breeze. They must be realising that now\u2026 \nAnd selfish? Maybe she\u2019s selfish. She birthed a child, unless someone asks her if she wants help with the child, she had absolutely no right to force people to do her job. So entitled.", "NTA you weren\u2019t rude you were honest about how you feel. It may not be what she wanted or expected to hear but now they know not to expect babysitting from you", "Nope. NTA. Why do people not understand there are lots of people, including women, who do not want kids? Trying to push them on us isn't going to change our minds.\n\nI suggest be nice to the kid. Remember birthdays and holiday, but no, you're not obligated to baby sit. You may find that you may relate to the kid better as he or she gets older, but I'm with you. Not everyone wants to be around kids.", "NTA. Can people please stop acting as if having babies is the number one priority for women? I don\u2019t want kids either. I love them but we\u2019ll I love to hand them back to their parents as well. If you don\u2019t want that should be reason enough.", "NTA\nI\u2019m happily childfree with my dogs and husband. You explained perfectly and reasonably why you will not care for theirs to fulfill the role of \u201cauntie.\u201d \n\nDid you have to explain yourself as you did? No. And the SIL should have accepted that. Not everyone or every situation deserves more than a simple \u201cNo thanks.\u201d", "NTA - Definitely need to set a clear boundary very early that you are not a free and on demand baby sitting service and you don't just grow out of not wanting children. \nYes, SOME people change. Not everyone does and your choice, privacy and free time should be respected.", ">If they were in a last minute pinch, I would obviously be okay to help them\n\nNo! Please don't do this. If you do, you'll be the one they hit up for last-minute unpaid babysitting duties every single time. Just say no to everything from the start. Them having a child does not mean that you are now obliged to help out. That was entirely on them, and had nothing to do with you.\n\nNTA.", "ESH :  Comparing her human child to your pets is never a good move.   That said you have no obligation at all to sit in maintenance of her spawn.", "As someone who has been pressured for years to have kids (I can't due to medical issues.  I'm not infertile though). I look people in the eye and tell people \"actually I'm infertile so no.  I'll never \"grow out of it\".  But thanks for thinking of me!!  \n\nThat shuts them up.  They usually turn white as a ghost too lol", "Also the way she goes about it is so annoying. Not \u201cWould you be able to?\u201d \u201cWould you like to take the baby for the day and regularly be on call for babysitting\u201d as if she (SIL) is doing the favour instead of asking for one", "Exactly this", "Yeah she was not excited to involve OP, sounded more like pawning off responsibility", "Who said older people can't have friends and their own lives? Also, there are a ton of people in nursing homes whose families never come to visit, so being old and alone isn't a reason.", "It's reluctant and free which is better than paying.", "I like how you think. I am childless and my sisters  had kids. I told my sisters once the the kids were house boken and could talk, I'd be there to spoil them rotten, when I felt like it and send them home dirty and over stimulated with noise toys and sticky stuff. It worked. I was true emergency only child care.\n\nBecause of that I got to play the cool Auntie who gave slightly inappropriate gifts. You know the ones kids love, but parents hate. Consider this as an option. I recommend starting this kind of gift giving early, it sets the right tone. \n\nI loved going to their parties, gaduations, weddings and such. Having fun, not worring about paying for or cleaning up afterward.  My niece and nephew are wonderful people and still call me and I never changed a diaper or lost a night of sleep.", "Also don\u2019t forget to ask SIL if the baby is toilet trained to poop outside cause your dog figured that out ages ago :)", "Yes lots of glitter,  the herpes of the craft world, it never go's away.  Just when you think you've seen the last of it, there it is BACK  Usually stuck on your face at an inappropriate time.", "I chose children & you, cool auntie, are more important to me & the children than free childcare any day!"]}
