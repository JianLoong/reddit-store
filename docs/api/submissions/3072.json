Obviously, I\u2019m still really happy for them, it\u2019s something they were very excited for and I\u2019m glad both mom and baby are healthy. \n\nI\u2019ve visited them a few times since they had their child, and on the last visit, my brother\u2019s gf (Kelly) said that she can\u2019t wait for me to start fulfilling my \u201cauntie\u201d roles. I laughed and said that I was okay to be a sideline auntie. She pushed the topic, asking me if I wanted to take the baby for days out and so on. I said no, I\u2019m too busy and I don\u2019t want to look after the baby. She said that it was time I grew out of my dislike for children, that it\u2019ll be good practice for when I have my own one day, and that she wants me to be involved. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m very against the concept that women must have babies to be fulfilled, I think mothers are strong and wonderful, but I\u2019ve always hated people telling me that my aversion to children will change and that I\u2019ll be unhappy if I don\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m very happy to not have children, and I don\u2019t particularly want to spend time caring for anyone else\u2019s. I told her this, and she got quite upset, and said that I was being selfish. It\u2019s worth noting that both our parents live very close by and are happy to take on childcare roles, they are financially stable, and Kelly doesn\u2019t work, so they don\u2019t need me as childcare, which would be different. If they were in a last minute pinch, I would obviously be okay to help them, but I don\u2019t really want to be childcare. \n\nI have horses, a dog, and parrots that I spend a lot of time looking after, and I asked her how she\u2019d feel if I expected her to clean up after them and feed them for me. She said that it was different because babies are special and a part of the family, to which I told her that my pets are part of the family as well. Whenever her and my brother come to visit, they\u2019ll say hi to the animals, but I\u2019ve never once asked them to do any care, and I said that it should be the same principle. \n\nAfter I left, my brother called me and said that I was being rude and selfish, and Kelly was just excited for me to be involved. I repeated that I\u2019m happy for them, but I won\u2019t be looking after their child at any point. \n\nLooking back, I feel like this could have been rude, but I also wholeheartedly believe what I said.

For an aunt without kids of her own and no particular interest in them I'd pin that at after they're solidly toilet trained, not before they support the weight of their own head.

This may feel very personal to parents, and very disrespectful. We love our pets, but baby is a whole human being, you can't just equate. Level of responsibility, level of bond, are just not the same. To give you a very extreme example, if one of your pets die, it's very, very sad. If a baby dies, it's an ultimate, unsurpassed human tragedy that will change fates of everyone involved.\n\nBabies are also smarter and more complicated than any pet. People who didn't spend a prolonged time with them underestimate how fascinating they are. They start to show their personality from day one, and by the age of 3-4 months they are very distinct, very special and show the traits they will carry through their whole life. As such, bringing them up is an impossible responsibility as anything you do will affect them and everyone around them for decades to come.\n\nIn short - do not, in any context, make this comparison. There are other ways to express the same - if anything, just by saying you don't feel comfortable being alone with the baby.\n\nOn a side note, I think it's fine you don't want to babysit. However, just as an unsolicited advice, try to find a way to bond with the baby nevertheless. For one, it's a person who will be in your life for a longest time, and it might be good for both of you to know each other better and have relationships. On the other hand, you might find that babies are more interesting than you think and are worth a small bit of your time.\n\nI was like you and I couldn't understand why people spend time with tiny kids.

It's possible she's solely doing this to try and somehow force OP into wanting/adoring children, of course. People like that are unfortunately common, and there's TONS of old wives tales about the various alleged magic properties of holding a baby.\n\n\nBut a woman who's newborn is only one month old, essentially begging for someone to take the baby away repeatedly for a whole day or for overnight? Raises at least a little red flag for possible post partum issues, surely? It just seems VERY early to want that much separation.", "Cooking meals for new parents is HUGELY helpful. It's honestly one of the best things you can do. Your brother and SIL should be grateful that you're helping in a way you can and that you're good at, and not pushing you to do something you're reluctant to do.", "I have stage four endometriosis, which has rendered me irrevocably infertile. I can technically get pregnant, although the chance is vanishingly slim, but in addition to that I cannot remain pregnant. I cannot have bodily children and that is simple fact, despite everyone and their Nan feeling the need to regale me with false hope and stories about people who COULD have a living child. \n\n\nThe pain and adhesions of my severity of endometriosis, the cysts and infections, plus the heavy medication to manage it all, have caused me to be on disability and not permitted to work for a decade. I've lost most of my sigmoid colon already to a bowel resection made necessary by scar tissue.\n\n\nThe only thing even approaching a cure is to remove one's ovaries et al. Even that won't fix the issue completely, but nonetheless it means I'm literally a perfect candidate for a full hysterectomy (inc. tubes and cervix). Even apart from the incredible relief and quality-of-life boost it will give me, it will also enable me to FINALLY become a fully-functioning member of society once more.\n\n\nAnd yet even with all that? I must first meet with a psychiatrist for a session, in which I must convince him that I do in fact know what I am asking for and that it is indeed in my best interests. I need a psychiatric's yes and their signature, before I am  *allowed* to receive the only actual treatment for my well-documented and disabling physical ailment.", "Exactly. I was born in 1988, when my mum was 33. Bio-father was her senior by two years, IIRC. And my parents were *always* the oldest out of my friends' parents.", "> I would rather have someone who doesn't want kids not have kids then have them caving and having kids.\n\nI have no kids. A dear, dear, friend of mine once said to me that I shouldn't let my fear of being a bad mother stop me from having kids. I gave him a funny look and walked away. I honestly had nothing I could say to that.\n\n(I'm glad I have no kids. It is probably the only good decision I've ever made. I do think other peoples' kids are pretty neat, but I have no instincts for it.)\n\nOP is NTA, btw.", "I totally agree with you; every child deserves a parent that actually wants them, and more so will be able to take care of them. Even though I don't like kids or never want to have them, I really hope that the people who actually really want them will be able to have them. \n\nI think not having kids can be seen from both point of views; as selfish and selfless, but both in a positive way.\n\nWhen I was younger more people were, well, a bit appalled that I don't want to have kids or saying \"you'll change your mind when you are older\". Now that I'm a bit older I think people understand this more, and I don't get comments like that.", "I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve heard of that before. I\u2019ll definitely check it out later!"]}
