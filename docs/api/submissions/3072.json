{"id": 3072, "submission_id": "z316i5", "title": "AITA for not wanting to look after my brother\u2019s new baby?", "selftext": "My brother (24m) and his girlfriend (26f) have just had their first child about a month ago. I (22f) really don\u2019t like kids, I don\u2019t want kids and I never interact with them in my life. Obviously, I\u2019m still really happy for them, it\u2019s something they were very excited for and I\u2019m glad both mom and baby are healthy. \n\nI\u2019ve visited them a few times since they had their child, and on the last visit, my brother\u2019s gf (Kelly) said that she can\u2019t wait for me to start fulfilling my \u201cauntie\u201d roles. I laughed and said that I was okay to be a sideline auntie. She pushed the topic, asking me if I wanted to take the baby for days out and so on. I said no, I\u2019m too busy and I don\u2019t want to look after the baby. She said that it was time I grew out of my dislike for children, that it\u2019ll be good practice for when I have my own one day, and that she wants me to be involved. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m very against the concept that women must have babies to be fulfilled, I think mothers are strong and wonderful, but I\u2019ve always hated people telling me that my aversion to children will change and that I\u2019ll be unhappy if I don\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m very happy to not have children, and I don\u2019t particularly want to spend time caring for anyone else\u2019s. I told her this, and she got quite upset, and said that I was being selfish. It\u2019s worth noting that both our parents live very close by and are happy to take on childcare roles, they are financially stable, and Kelly doesn\u2019t work, so they don\u2019t need me as childcare, which would be different. If they were in a last minute pinch, I would obviously be okay to help them, but I don\u2019t really want to be childcare. \n\nI have horses, a dog, and parrots that I spend a lot of time looking after, and I asked her how she\u2019d feel if I expected her to clean up after them and feed them for me. She said that it was different because babies are special and a part of the family, to which I told her that my pets are part of the family as well. Whenever her and my brother come to visit, they\u2019ll say hi to the animals, but I\u2019ve never once asked them to do any care, and I said that it should be the same principle. \n\nAfter I left, my brother called me and said that I was being rude and selfish, and Kelly was just excited for me to be involved. I repeated that I\u2019m happy for them, but I won\u2019t be looking after their child at any point. \n\nLooking back, I feel like this could have been rude, but I also wholeheartedly believe what I said.

Enjoy being the sideline auntie and maintaining the lifestyle you want. You don\u2019t owe anyone childcare or a relationship. \n\nAlso- if your brother and his gf continue to acted entitled to your time, stock up on musical toys and gift them to the baby when they are old enough.

Demanding is when you ask, someone says \"no\" and then you refuse to take \"no\" for an answer and respond with insults. Making demands is rude and selfish.

Animals take up a lot of time when it comes to their care & they are just as important as babies (which I\u2019m aware you obviously already know how special animals are!) kinda concerning that Kelly is more focused on pushing a sexist narrative than the safety of her child. (Not trying to imply you\u2019d purposefully harm the kid!) if you are uncomfortable with children you should be the last person she wants taking care of her kid.

Just because you choose not to have kids doesn't mean you don't have a life and job and obligations you must fulfil. Not having kids doesn't automatically sign you up as the go to babysitter for relatives ESPECIALLY when they have other options with people who WANT to do it (parents).\n\nstand your ground and reiterate that you will not babysit outside of legit emergencies. THEIR kid is THEIR responsibility not yours\n\nyou can totally be involved without babysitting, go to those bday parties and holiday get togethers, go to family bbq's, you can totally be a part of the kids life without being forced to do stuff you don't want to do. that is exactly what me/hubby do...we don't have kids either and will not babysit unless its an emergency", "NTA. Your choices should be respected and you don't have obligations to do aunty things. You're not a babysitter or fill in caregiver. \n\nIt's worth taking the time to get to know the little one (in a \"I'm giving the child back now\" way) and you'll have some obligations about involving them a bit because that's what the family looks like now (ie don't actively ignore them at Christmas) but it sounds like your brother and sister in law are out of line.\n\nEdit: is this soet of behaviour normal for your brother and sister in law? If it's not, it's worth remembering that they're probably stressed as hell, exhausted and probably not thinking at their best. I know I wasn't. If you can, keep the conversation as rational as you can - but *don't compromise on your boundaries*", "NTA, ask them why they would want someone who has no interest in looking after they child to be taking care of them.

They need more people available so they can have breaks and go out. They assume because you are young and a woman that you want to be around children and will change your mind.

Don't let them push you into becoming a free babysitter. She is the selfish one for trying to make you get involved with a child she decided to make, as is your brother.

I've never liked babies.  I just don't get it.  But when kids get to be 5 or 6, you can start having a conversation with them.  Then it starts to be fun.  It's possible that as your niece grows up, you'll be more into her.\n\nI think you should tell your brother that you think you and SIL were having two different conversations.  Explain that you have every intention of being in the kid's life.  But you are not comfortable being solely responsible for the safety of a baby.

I thought you explained it to her well with your example of your animals. Babies are a lot of responsibility, and she shouldn't be willing to leave her baby with someone who doesn't want to care for them. That's just irresponsible on her part.

He hated screaming babies when he was a screaming baby. While he's looking forward to being the cool uncle, I know that doesn't include taking care of a baby. I expect he'll be more involved when the kids are a bit older and, hopefully, screaming less.

I didn't word it very well. Breaking it down:\n1. She doesn't have obligations about caring for the child etc and her brother and sister in law are way out of line.\n\n2. She has an obligation not to be an arsehole to the child (edit: the standard \"don't be an arsehole\" obligation) and if she wants nothing at all to do with them, she needs to be prepared that it will most likely have justifiable consequences from family. ie the family choosing the child over the OP. But I don't think this is what OP is talking about.\n\n3. Engaging with kids as an aunt/uncle can be awesome and there might be things she enjoys about the relationship - in a \"I'm giving the child back now\" sort of way. \n\nSo obligation is to not be an arsehole, she should stand her ground on boundaries and over time there might be some things she enjoys.", "Don\u2019t worry I think I get you, and yeah, I don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll drop kick the child across the front lawn! I\u2019m happy to see/interact with the kid, hence I\u2019ve visited them a few times, mostly to bring food because I like cooking and I thought they\u2019re probably too busy to be making fancy meals. \n\nMy SIL loves children, was training to be a primary school teacher, and has talked about babies from when we met. She\u2019s always been adamant that I will want kids and I will love her kids when she has them, which I\u2019ve never appreciated, but I\u2019ve never reacted to it because I just think we have different mindsets. The reason I am more adamant about it now is because it\u2019s become a real situation. \n\nI included the bit about my animals only because  it\u2019s the same to me, if my family comes to my house I\u2019d expect them to respect that I have pets, they don\u2019t even have to pet or play with my dog if they don\u2019t want to, and I\u2019d never ask any of them to feed him or clean up after him.", "Probably for the best they just cut contact. That way everyone wins", "Yeah it sounds like we're on the same page. It seems that your SIL is pulling some stupid \"motherhood means more woman cred than you\" shit. Stick to your boundaries and be the more reasonable person in the room - so everyone knows you're not the problem.\n\nAlso delivering cooked meals is awesome. That can beca real help when there's a newborn."]}
