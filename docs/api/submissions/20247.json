Afterward, a friend/bridesmaid (22F), let's call her Evelyn, suggested going dress shopping when 2 other friends would be in town visiting from CA. The out of town friends asked to make the appt on Thursday at 3pm since they were WFH. My work is flexible & Evelyn also agreed.\n\nDays before the appt, Evelyn sends a text that she won't be able to make it anymore. This bridal salon, & most others, closed by 5 or 6 on weekdays. The four of us were traveling on Friday, so Thursday was the only time that worked for the girls visiting from out of town. Evelyn had also attended my first wedding dress appt a few weeks prior.\n\nAt the appt., I of course wasn't looking at my phone since it was in the dressing room while trying on dresses. Eventually, I find a dress that I really love. At some point, Evelyn texted in a group text asking for an update. The friend who is a bridesmaid, let's call her Nina, sent a photo & said \"We may have found the dress.\" Evelyn's response was \"Interesting!\".\n\nI end up buying the dress. The four of us, including Evelyn, had plans 3 hours later to all hang out. I was excited to show her my dress when she got there and tell her that I did buy it.\n\nWhen she got to my house, the first thing she said was, \"Did you buy a dress?\" and I excitedly told her yes. She didn't get excited & just stared at me for like 5-10 secs. I half-jokingly said \"What? Are you mad I bought a dress when you weren't there?\" And she said \"Ya I am. Hope you guys have fun tonight\" and left my house.\n\nWithin 10 mins, she texts me saying things like \"I'm so fucking pissed at you\" \"If you thought I wouldn't be upset about this, you're out of your damn mind\" \"there are other peoples feelings that count\" \"get a fucking grip bridezilla.\" She came back over, and she cried and yelled at me and continued to tell me that I was selfish bc I wasn't thinking about her while trying on my wedding dress. That I was selfish for not thinking about my other bridesmaids, my sisters, my mom, etc.\n\nShe started to \"rank\" my friends, and created a hierarchy of my bridesmaids, and told me that it's fucked up that I bought a wedding dress with Nina and a friend who isn't a bridesmaid. She also told me that the wedding dress was the one thing she really cared about, and she couldn\u2019t care less about any other thing about my wedding.\n\nFor rest of the weekend, we put aside our differences and we were able to get along. But now that the weekend is over, I can't stop thinking of all of this. She's still putting blame on me for what happened last week, and I'm seriously considering getting rid of her as a bridesmaid, but I also know that that would end the friendship we have. She hasn't acted like this before & I know that part of the reason she acted this way is because she's insecure about how close I am with Nina & feels threatened.\n\nAITA for not thinking about her (or anyone other than myself and my fianc\u00e9) when buying a wedding dress?", "created_utc": 1687363026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fbip0/aita_for_not_thinking_of_my_bridesmaids_feelings/", "score": 480, "replies": ["[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nThis bridemaidzilla has main character syndrome. \n\nThis is your wedding and your dress!

The bridal party is an honor, and a job.\n\nIs she jealous you\u2019re getting married and she\u2019s not?

That overreaction was out of line and you'll never forget it.", "NTA\n\nI get it, shes upset she wasnt a part of the process involving her friend.  BUT, it sounds more like its a good thing she wasnt there.

I flat out tell her to get over herself now or to forget my number.", "NTA - It appears you have a bridesmaidzilla in your bridal party. Crazy!", "Just like others said, she unhinged and you might need to cut this person out of your life. She\u2019s immature, disrespectful, and has a very nasty attitude. Nothing you did warranted anything even close to that reaction, especially when she\u2019s the one who cancelled last minute even though she agreed on the earlier time and day.", "NTA. Evelyn is being silly, making this all about herself. Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe she's jealous, maybe other stuff. But it's definitely not about what you did, which is totally normal. You should talk to her about it and specifically mention the stuff she said/texted that you keep thinking about. It sounds like she said some things that are close to falling into the \"saying stuff you can't take back\" category... but that doesn't mean she can't apologize for saying them. I'm the type of person who can let stuff go pretty easily once it's acknowledged and apologized for, but if I never get an apology I hold that grudge forever (not a great way to be!); if you're similar, it does no good to try to ignore it. Talk to your friend! Lastly, I'd encourage you to be ready to forgive her if you can. Weddings make people weirdly emotional, even when they're barely involved. Definitely not worth losing friends over. Good luck!", ">She also told me that the wedding dress was the one thing she really cared about, and she didn\u2019t couldn\u2019t care less about any other thing about my wedding.\n\nNTA and if she cares more about the dress than the fact that you're, yknow, starting a marriage which is the whole reason for the wedding and the dress in the first place, then she really shouldn't be a bridesmaid at all. Honestly, probably shouldn't be invited to the wedding.", "NTA, this person sounds unhinged. She was invited, dropped out on her own and expects you to wait for her to choose YOUR dress. I would def drop her as a bridesmaid.", "NTA. You will be if you don\u2019t remove her as a Bridesmaid, though. Girl needs some time away.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t being selfish because it is your dress that you\u2019re going to wear on your wedding. It also seems like Evelyn was emotionally triggered stemming from some unresolved issue, and that\u2019s not on you. I hope all works out!", "Lol she's got mental problems. NTA. I hope no one is crazy enough to date that thing. Uninvite it from the wedding.", "SHE suggested to shop for dresses. Also, prior you had already shopped for dresses with HER. \n\nSHE cancelled.\n\nNow SHE calls you a bridezilla because she wasn't there when you bought the dress?\n\nShe couldn't just be happy and excited for you?\n\nQUESTION: Why do you call this woman your friend?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut, woooooooooooooo\n\nYour \"friend\" either has *issues* or is simply an unpleasant person.\n\nWhy do you want her even close to your wedding after this rather bizarre temper tantrum?", "NTA, at all. The only feelings that matters when you are buying YOUR wedding dress are YOURS! This is about you an no about her at all.\n\nI think the best is to ask her not to be a bridesmaid any more. I am sure this wont be the last time she does something like this, like, what will happened when she doesn't like the centerpiece you chose or when your chose the menu without her or if your honeymoon destination is not a place she likes?\n\nAnd be prepare she is gonna force her boyfriend to propose on your wedding. I can already see it. *\"She's told me she's given her bf a deadline to propose by, and it happens to be our wedding day\"* I think that was her way to let you know that is goin to happen. \n\nIf she doesn't have the maturity to understand your wedding is about you and not her (and let not talk about the immaturity to be jealous of you other friend) juts tell her she can not be part anymore.

I assume she's now an ***ex***\\-bridesmaid?", "NTA - sounds like you may need some distance from that \"friend\".", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the dress.  This is her wanting to feel like her opinions matter and that you need her approval.

Because she sure seems to be under the impression that\u2019s she\u2019s the main character here.\n\nNTA. And id be disinviting her from the wedding if I were you.

With all due respect to your dress which I am sure is lovely, the dress is not the most important thing about a wedding. Two people being happy, and being joined forever, is the most important thing about a wedding. She's lost the plot. You say that she's not normally like this, so it's possible that there's a stressor to discuss and diffuse. But to be clear, 100% NTA. \n\nShe is not the person who is getting married. If she hasn't emphatically acknowledged that after you attempt to speak calmly about her outburst, then I do think that unfortunately it's time to remove her from the wedding party. Doing that will probably end that relationship and probably divide your friend circle, so I do think it's worthwhile to give her a chance to cool down and reflect. But if she can't get a grip on what the actual priority is and who the actual main character is, that's her sad little problem to deal with somewhere other than at your wedding. Too much damage could be done.", "Nta but you need to nip this in the bud now, these things only ever get crazier in their entitlement.

She's still young (only 22) and has only been with her current bf for like a year and a half. I've been with my now-fianc\u00e9 for over 7 years, which is longer than I've even known her, so I don't know if it's a fear about losing me to him. But there is *def* some insecurity and fear about \"losing me\" to another friend. Thankfully the two friends who were visiting from out of town were in the house and voluntarily gave us privacy for the whole conversation while Evelyn and I talked in my back yard. They were so insanely understanding about the situation, and I felt so badly that this all went down while they were visiting. \n\nI do definitely think there is a bit of jealousy about the fact that I'm getting married though. She's told me she's given her bf a deadline to propose by, and it happens to be our wedding day.

Besides an ultimatum? Who does that?", "I had to boot a bridesmaid out of my wedding party/cease the friendship for similar reasons. She did admit she was jealous of my \u201cperfect life\u201d and it was definitely showing.  Friends are supposed to be cheering you on, not tearing you down, hoping you fail or sabotaging your successes. Finding your wedding dress is a success, and she tarnished that day for you. \n\nHer choosing your wedding date as a deadline for a proposal is a countdown for trouble. That\u2019s the kind of warning she might MAKE her boyfriend propose literally at your wedding. \n\nIf you don\u2019t boot her, make sure the dj /band has a song ready and lights queued to drown out any distractions like that.

She will try to take the focus off of you.  Cut the cord now before this gets worse.  Remove her from being in your wedding party.

Or how will she hijack your wedding reception if he does?\n\nIt would be kinder to everyone to tell her that the whole dress experience has showed that you two may have differing expectations on how your bridal party is there for you, and that you'd love to invite her to be free of your expectations and just enjoy herself as a guest. \n\nYou're NTA.", "What the ever loving fuck? \n\nWhy are you friends with Evelyn?

The purpose of a bridal party is to support the bride in the wedding and the marriage, and the purpose of guests is to witness and support the married couple in their future.\n\nIf you find yourself being upset that it is not all about you, if you are finding yourself wondering what you are getting out of it, if you find yourself privately or vocally judging and comparing the decoration or food choices, if you find yourself upset at where you are sitting or whether or not you got a plus one or get to bring your kid, if you are sizing up other people who are also there to collectively support the bride or groom, and especially if you are *actively making things more difficult for either or both of the people getting married,* then you have completely lost sight of your role and you should step down or not attend, for everyone\u2019s sake. \n\nIf I were OP, I would meet up with this woman, tell them how their behaviour made you feel, remind them of their role as described above, and ask if she thinks she can realistically fulfill it without prioritizing herself or comparing herself to others.

If she continues the antics, inform her that you are disappointed to have to remove her from the wedding party.\n\nYour friendship you can sort out, and maybe you can hear each other out about where you feel you are in your friendship at this point, but that needs to be completely separate from the wedding events.", ">bridesmaidzilla  lmao\n\n100% Her attitude is unhinged.
