After, a friend/bridesmaid (22F), let's call her Evelyn, suggested going dress shopping when 2 other friends who would be in town visiting from CA. The out of town friends asked to make the appt on Thursday at 3pm since they were WFH. My work is flexible & Evelyn also agreed.\n\nDays before the appt, Evelyn sends a text that she won't be able to make it anymore. This bridal salon, & most others, closed by 5 or 6 on weekdays. The four of us were traveling on Friday, so Thursday was the only time that worked for the girls visiting from out of town. Evelyn had also attended my first wedding dress appt a few weeks prior.\n\nAt the appt., I of course wasn't looking at my phone since it was in the dressing room while trying on dresses. Eventually, I find a dress that I really love. At some point, Evelyn texted in a group text asking for an update. The friend who is a bridesmaid, let's call her Nina, sent a photo & said \"We may have found the dress.\" Evelyn's response was \"Interesting\".\n\nI end up buying the dress. The four of us, including Evelyn, had plans 3 hours later to all hang out. I was excited to show her my dress when she got there and tell her that I did buy it.\n\nWhen she got to my house, the first thing she said was, \"Did you buy a dress?\" and I excitedly told her yes. She didn't get excited & just stared at me for like 5-10 secs. I half-jokingly said \"What? Are you mad I bought a dress when you weren't there?\" And she said \"Ya I am. Hope you guys have fun tonight\" and left my house.\n\nWithin 10 mins, she texts me saying things like \"I'm so fucking pissed at you\" \"If you thought I wouldn't be upset about this, you're out of your damn mind\" \"there are other peoples feelings that count\" \"get a fucking grip bridezilla.\" She came back over, and she cried and yelled at me and continued to tell me that I was selfish bc I wasn't thinking about her while trying on my wedding dress. That I was selfish for not thinking about my other bridesmaids, my sisters, my mom, etc.\n\nShe started to \"rank\" my friends, and created a hierarchy of my bridesmaids, and told me that it's fucked up that I bought a wedding dress with Nina and a friend who isn't a bridesmaid. She also told me that the wedding dress was the one thing she really cared about, and she didn\u2019t couldn\u2019t care less about any other thing about my wedding.\n\nFor rest of the weekend, we put aside our differences and we were able to get along. But now that the weekend is over, I can't stop thinking of all of this. She's still putting blame on me for what happened last week, and I'm seriously considering getting rid of her as a bridesmaid, but I also know that that would end the friendship we have. She hasn't acted like this before & I know that part of the reason she acted this way is because she's insecure about how close I am with Nina & feels threatened.\n\nAITA for not thinking about her (or anyone other than myself and my fianc\u00e9) when buying a wedding dress?", "created_utc": 1687363026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fbip0/aita_for_not_thinking_of_my_bridesmaids_feelings/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to grow up.  The ONLY person who needs to be there when you buy the dress is YOU. The only person who needs to love the dress is YOU.   This is all about you and your fiance!", "NTA \n\nThis bridemaidzilla has main character syndrome. \n\nThis is your wedding and your dress! She can be disappointed to miss out on the \u2018yes to the dress\u2019 moment but to be honest sounds unhinged. Unless she can reflect and apologise I would drop her from the wedding, who knows what she\u2019ll do if she feels slighted then!?", "Your \"friend\" got a big (and may I say disgusting) case of main-character-syndrome. Way to make another person's choosing and buying a weddingdress about her and her feelings all alone. Of course you are NTA! I'd throw that person off of the weddingparty all together, who knows what else she might try to make your wedding about her.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding and finding a dress you love!\n\nYour friend is making YOUR wedding about HER feelings. That\u2019s highly inappropriate, and unbelievably selfish of her. A wedding is one day, marriage is expected to be a long term (ideally forever) commitment.   If she couldn\u2019t care less about anything else about your wedding- then she might not be a good mutual match for the job of being in your wedding.  The bridal party is an honor, and a job.\n\nIs she jealous you\u2019re getting married and she\u2019s not? Is there fear on her part she\u2019ll lose you as her friend competing with your husband (aside from the Nina rivalry)? Was all this friendship hierarchy outburst in front of the other friends, or privately at your house?", "NTA. Evelyn is CRAZY! I hope you update us\u2026I cannot wait to hear the stories from your wedding. She is going to cause so much drama. \n\nBridesmaidzilla!", "I'm sorry, when did your wedding become about a bridesmaid? They're there to support  you on *your* big day. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKick her out of your wedding. You dont need the drama.", "NTA she sounds unhinged", "Bridesmaid-zilla ? Is that a term? If not, it is now!\n\nNTA", "I guess she might be jealous of you somehow, and wants to live vicariously through you and your wedding dress shopping? \n\nAnyway, as she \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less about any other thing about [your] wedding\u201d, I guess she won\u2019t care if you kick her out of the bridal party anyhow, so go ahead! NTA", "NTA. You should literally think about no one other than yourself when buying a wedding dress. It's your wedding and you are gonna be the one wearing it so your opinion is of the highest order and trumps anyone else's.\n\nIts not like you excluded her on purpose. It just so happened she couldn't make it. Not the end of the world. I could understand if she was a little bit upset but her reaction was so over the top she was basically bridesmaidzilla.", "NTA. She was invited. She canceled. What were you meant to do?", "NTA kick her from the bridal party and your life. That overreaction was out of line and you'll never forget it.", "NTA\n\nI get it, shes upset she wasnt a part of the process involving her friend.  BUT, it sounds more like its a good thing she wasnt there.  I get the feeling if she was the process would have been about her and not you.\n\nYou nailed it with her feeling threatened and acting out but it is not an excuse with regards to how she acted out against pretty much everyone.", "You should remove her from the wedding party and tell her she\u2019s at the bottom of the damn pecking order. Her behavior is atrocious and delusional. I would cut that person out of my life full stop.", "NTA I don't know if something else is going on in her life but that's not normal. If she was just disappointed that she couldn't make it that would be fine but she wouldn't even need to mention that to you.", "NTA - she's nucking futs, and thinks your wedding is about her.", "NTA. I flat out tell her to get over herself now or to forget my number.", "NTA - It appears you have a bridesmaidzilla in your bridal party. Crazy!", "Just like others said, she unhinged and you might need to cut this person out of your life. She\u2019s immature, disrespectful, and has a very nasty attitude. Nothing you did warranted anything even close to that reaction, especially when she\u2019s the one who cancelled last minute even though she agreed on the earlier time and day.", "NTA. Evelyn is being silly, making this all about herself. Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe she's jealous, maybe other stuff. But it's definitely not about what you did, which is totally normal. You should talk to her about it and specifically mention the stuff she said/texted that you keep thinking about. It sounds like she said some things that are close to falling into the \"saying stuff you can't take back\" category... but that doesn't mean she can't apologize for saying them. I'm the type of person who can let stuff go pretty easily once it's acknowledged and apologized for, but if I never get an apology I hold that grudge forever (not a great way to be!); if you're similar, it does no good to try to ignore it. Talk to your friend! Lastly, I'd encourage you to be ready to forgive her if you can. Weddings make people weirdly emotional, even when they're barely involved. Definitely not worth losing friends over. Good luck!", ">She also told me that the wedding dress was the one thing she really cared about, and she didn\u2019t couldn\u2019t care less about any other thing about my wedding.\n\nNTA and if she cares more about the dress than the fact that you're, yknow, starting a marriage which is the whole reason for the wedding and the dress in the first place, then she really shouldn't be a bridesmaid at all. Honestly, probably shouldn't be invited to the wedding.", "NTA, this person sounds unhinged. She was invited, dropped out on her own and expects you to wait for her to choose YOUR dress. I would def drop her as a bridesmaid.", "NTA. You will be if you don\u2019t remove her as a Bridesmaid, though. Girl needs some time away.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t being selfish because it is your dress that you\u2019re going to wear on your wedding. It also seems like Evelyn was emotionally triggered stemming from some unresolved issue, and that\u2019s not on you. I hope all works out!", "Lol she's got mental problems. NTA. I hope no one is crazy enough to date that thing. Uninvite it from the wedding.", "SHE suggested to shop for dresses. Also, prior you had already shopped for dresses with HER. \n\nSHE cancelled.\n\nNow SHE calls you a bridezilla because she wasn't there when you bought the dress?\n\nShe couldn't just be happy and excited for you?\n\nQUESTION: Why do you call this woman your friend?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut, woooooooooooooo\n\nYour \"friend\" either has *issues* or is simply an unpleasant person.\n\nWhy do you want her even close to your wedding after this rather bizarre temper tantrum?", "NTA, at all. The only feelings that matters when you are buying YOUR wedding dress are YOURS! This is about you an no about her at all.\n\nI think the best is to ask her not to be a bridesmaid any more. I am sure this wont be the last time she does something like this, like, what will happened when she doesn't like the centerpiece you chose or when your chose the menu without her or if your honeymoon destination is not a place she likes?\n\nAnd be prepare she is gonna force her boyfriend to propose on your wedding. I can already see it. *\"She's told me she's given her bf a deadline to propose by, and it happens to be our wedding day\"* I think that was her way to let you know that is goin to happen. \n\nIf she doesn't have the maturity to understand your wedding is about you and not her (and let not talk about the immaturity to be jealous of you other friend) juts tell her she can not be part anymore. And deal with he drama she is gonna create because of that now and no closer to the wedding.", "NTA. When you find your dress, you just know it. Since it's YOUR wedding, YOU get to make these decisions. Don't question yourself, after all,  it is about you and your fiancee.", "NTA perhaps now is the time to remove her as a bridesmaid.", "*Evelyn sends a text that she won't be able to make it anymore.*\n\nShe said she couldn't make it, and now is pissed off that the world continued revolving without her.  She's making this all about her.  The way she acted out is horrible.  I assume she's now an ***ex***\\-bridesmaid?", "NTA - sounds like you may need some distance from that \"friend\".", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the dress.  This is her wanting to feel like her opinions matter and that you need her approval.  The further you go into your wedding planning the more likely she\u2019ll expect you to involve her to \u201cmake up\u201d for finding a wedding dress without her.", "NTA.. get rid of the toxic mess", "NtA. Ditch her. It\u2019s your wedding you can do whatever you want. She\u2019s not even paying for the dress. She\u2019s not a friend. She\u2019s looney.", "Honestly, I would have kicked her out of my house *and* wedding after she went off, so you must have the patience of a saint, but if you choose to keep her in (0/10 do not recommend) be fully prepared for her to goad her boyfriend into proposing at your wedding.", "Is she aware this is your wedding and not hers?\n\nNTA", "Unless you are marrying your friend\u2026 she has NOTHING to do with your dress or dress shopping or any other choices or events around your wedding - especially if she couldn\u2019t make it. \n\nYes it\u2019s nice to include bridesmaids and friends in different events but it\u2019s not a necessity. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your friend sounds absolutely crazy. I wouldn't even know how to respond to someone like that. Maybe she shouldn't be in the bridal party since she has expectations that are completely out of the realm of \"normal.\"", "NTA it\u2019s your dress and your wedding", "Question: is Evelyn aware that she is Not the one getting married?  Because she sure seems to be under the impression that\u2019s she\u2019s the main character here.\n\nNTA. And id be disinviting her from the wedding if I were you. She will 100% pull some kind of attention grabbing stunt, and I would Not put it past her to show up in a wedding dress or at least white dress.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With all due respect to your dress which I am sure is lovely, the dress is not the most important thing about a wedding. Two people being happy, and being joined forever, is the most important thing about a wedding. She's lost the plot. You say that she's not normally like this, so it's possible that there's a stressor to discuss and diffuse. But to be clear, 100% NTA. \n\nShe is not the person who is getting married. If she hasn't emphatically acknowledged that after you attempt to speak calmly about her outburst, then I do think that unfortunately it's time to remove her from the wedding party. Doing that will probably end that relationship and probably divide your friend circle, so I do think it's worthwhile to give her a chance to cool down and reflect. But if she can't get a grip on what the actual priority is and who the actual main character is, that's her sad little problem to deal with somewhere other than at your wedding. Too much damage could be done.", "Nta but you need to nip this in the bud now, these things only ever get crazier in their entitlement. Next it'll be demands for on the day because you owe her after the dress. To be clear you owe her nothing.", "Dump her as a friend and don't invite her to your wedding at all. What a weird flex.

She doesn't have any sway over who or when you go shopping for your wedding dress.  She knew, and agreed, to the dress appointment and then backed out.  She is cuckoo for CocoPuffs if she thought that meant that you would not move forward without her.\n\nIt may be time to let her go, both as a bridesmaid and as a friend.", "Thanks so much, that's very sweet!\n\nI'm not sure about all of this. She's still young (only 22) and has only been with her current bf for like a year and a half. I've been with my now-fianc\u00e9 for over 7 years, which is longer than I've even known her, so I don't know if it's a fear about losing me to him. But there is *def* some insecurity and fear about \"losing me\" to another friend. Thankfully the two friends who were visiting from out of town were in the house and voluntarily gave us privacy for the whole conversation while Evelyn and I talked in my back yard. They were so insanely understanding about the situation, and I felt so badly that this all went down while they were visiting. \n\nI do definitely think there is a bit of jealousy about the fact that I'm getting married though.

Which feels weird, but I'm not even gonna comment on that one.", "I mean, I've seen enough AITA threads where a bridesmaid/groomsman-zilla is the true AH that it should be.

Besides an ultimatum? Who does that?", "I had to boot a bridesmaid out of my wedding party/cease the friendship for similar reasons. She did admit she was jealous of my \u201cperfect life\u201d and it was definitely showing.  Friends are supposed to be cheering you on, not tearing you down, hoping you fail or sabotaging your successes. Finding your wedding dress is a success, and she tarnished that day for you. \n\nHer choosing your wedding date as a deadline for a proposal is a countdown for trouble. That\u2019s the kind of warning she might MAKE her boyfriend propose literally at your wedding. \n\nIf you don\u2019t boot her, make sure the dj /band has a song ready and lights queued to drown out any distractions like that.

She will try to take the focus off of you.  Cut the cord now before this gets worse.  Remove her from being in your wedding party.  Also make sure guests know that it will not be tolerated to make any personal announcements at your wedding,  ex. Proposals or pregnancy announcements.  They will immediately be shut down and escorted off of the property", "NTA\n\nAnd to be honest I will uninvite her, she is going to create problems during all the process and during YOUR day (and the one of your fianc\u00e9)", ">She's told me she's given her bf a deadline to propose by, and it happens to be our wedding day.\n\noh no.\n\nIt's okay to be friends with this person, but she centered your entire dress-buying experience around *her* schedule and *her* feelings, and resorted to name-calling when you failed to placate her fast enough.\n\nWhat is she capable of doing on your wedding day if her boyfriend doesn't meet her ultimatum? Or how will she hijack your wedding reception if he does?\n\nIt would be kinder to everyone to tell her that the whole dress experience has showed that you two may have differing expectations on how your bridal party is there for you, and that you'd love to invite her to be free of your expectations and just enjoy herself as a guest. \n\nYou're NTA."]}
