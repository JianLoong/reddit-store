As with all entitled people, she couldn\u2019t accept she was wrong so I ended up blocking her.", ">she's still your mom, and if you don't need her then you don't need me,\" \n\nThat's just wrong, just because she's your mum doesn't mean you MUST have her in your life. \n\n>Now my wife has been trying to do the same as my brother.\n\nSorry but I'd be telling your wife to BACK OFF and that you're willing to die on this hill and under no circumstances is she to share information with the kids to her. \n\nAs for your dad ask him would he let another human treat him the way he did? Would he allow himself to be used and abused I'm certain the answer is no\n\nNta", "NTA.  I'm surprised you haven't cut her (and all the other people enabling her) off already.  But well done on getting there finally (I know its not always that easy when it is \"family\").", "The thought is they want the kids to have the choice of a relationship with her, and we'd protect them from the bad parts.\nI view her whole existence as something to protect them from.", "That's how an abuser isolates you. The best thing to do is to wait it out and remember that they are also being abused behind the scenes. They'll come to it on their own, and you'll be there to support each other when it all goes down. Abusers end up outing themselves. It doesn't matter if people don't believe you right now. Don't distance yourself from the only family/friends you have because you think you're alone- you already aren't.", "It's *so worth it.*", "My thoughts exactly. She sounds awful", "I was going to say that too, she should go to Aussie instead.", "My sister. Only took about 40 years to give up and cut her off.", "Fun Story, I had actually walked away from the church about a decade ago. But when my grandma called me crying and telling me the verses my mom had used, I actually got to use \"Satan can quote the Bible too, grandmommy, it doesn't mean he understands it\" (yes, Im a grown man that calls my grandma grandmommy) that I found on Reddit lol", "Perfectly said.", "It's actually really hard not to. I think I'm relating their current support of her unconsciously as approval of her past abuses even though I know it's not true. \n\nThey're just concerned she'll screw up again or die before I let go of the anger and reconcile, and the kids will never have the choice to have a relationship with her or not.", "You can\u2019t protect them from the bad parts if *she is* the bad parts. NTA.", "You are a wise dude my guy. Your mom should be in jail.", "Who the hell does your wife think she is? She's endangering your children. Tell her to get in line or pack her bags. Only you know your mother.", "\"How? No really, *how*? Even if we only let her have supervised visits, we're only human, and it doesn't take her *that* long to do something that could be traumatizing; ask me how I know. There is literally *no feasible way* to protect them from *all* the \"bad parts\" unless we dump the whole box as a set of rejects\".", "You have endured things no child should ever have to. Reading all the things she's done during your adulthood, part of my brain screams \"why didn't this guy tell her to eat shit years ago?!\" I know it's nowhere near that simple in reality though. \n\nEvery child craves the love, and approval, of their parent(s). Abuse magnifies that, and the desire only becomes stronger the longer it is denied. Sparse morsels of affection are just enough to keep that hope from dying of starvation. Adulthood doesn't erase that, and our inner child continues to hope against hope.\n\nYou needed someone to protect you from your mom when you were a child. You needed someone to save you; to shield you from the abuse she inflicted. You need to be that person now, for your own children. You need to do for them what no one did for you. \n\nYou can't protect them from the bad parts of your mom, because those qualities are an intrinsic part of her. She's never going to change without *a lot* of work to better herself. With the way her toxicity has always been a part of your life, there's a lot you probably don't even recognize as bad. My husband went through a mere fraction of what you did, and he was still discovering how wrong some of his family's actions were 5+ years later. It's hard to see it when you're still trapped in the storm.\n\nThis is a hill worth dying on. Please, speak with a therapist. The outside perspective of a professional can help reinforce what you already know, and help you stand firm in your decision to cut your mom from your lives. They can also help process everything you've been through, and help you heal the wounds that have been open for far too long.", "I cut ties with my abusive parents and lost most of my family too. The reality is the abuse rubs off, almost everyone has it, and unless they're willing to seriously work on themselves it's gonna stay that way. Very few are willing.", "That's how an abusers manipulates other people into *also* abusing you- just because someone is also a victim doesn't mean you need to put up with that behavior. Being \"isolated\" is worth it if means cutting off the toxic behavior of others and I do know from experience. My sister eventually stopped the behavior that made me cut her off (despite her continuing to have a messed up relationship with our father) because she knew I wouldn't put up with that shit.", ">The best thing to do is to wait it\n\nI'd be waiting since 20 years then so no, screw that. If I had to wait it out I'd probably end up waiting my entire life. You have a lot of wishful thinking there, but often enough this isn't how it works sadly.", "Well your mom is only 59. It's not like she's on her deathbed. Even if she was, you still don't have to reconcile. It's your choice. And your decision if you want to have your kids know YOUR mom. It's your mom, not your wife's mom, and you know her better.", "Does your wife have loving parents?  Sometimes it\u2019s difficult for people who have had that to completely grasp just how horrendous some parents were/are.  Especially if they improve a bit over time.  There\u2019s also pressure today to fix relationships before a person passes so that the survivor has no guilt.  Does your dad have guilt that some of his actions may have caused your mom to behave as she did so this is his way of trying to make amends?  Just trying to figure out where they are coming from OP.  You have my empathy.  My brothers and I were so lucky we had the parents we had.  It\u2019s amazing that you made it through as a decent and loving individual to your wife, kids, and friends.  NTA by any stretch.", ">It's actually really hard not to. I think I'm relating their current support of her unconsciously as approval of her past abuses even though I know it's not true. \n\nI think couples counseling would be a good idea.  Deal with/work through this before damage is done that cannot be repaired. Maybe a neutral party can get your wife's head out of her butt. Have you told her you will divorce her to protect the children from your mother? If not, you should. \n\n>They're just concerned she'll screw up again or die before I let go of the anger and reconcile, and the kids will never have the choice to have a relationship with her or not.\n\nI...fail to see why this would be bad.\n\nOh, and NTA.", ">They're just concerned she'll screw up again or die before I let go of the anger and reconcile, and the kids will never have the choice to have a relationship with her or not.\n\nKids that have been neglected and abused by their parents typically have a deep longing for the love and affection from their parents since they never really got that when they were children. But your children have you, your wife and maybe some other important persons in their life and do not need to have a relationship with an abuser (as children; if she lives when they are grown up you can tell them your full story and let them decide themselves).\n\nThink about it this way: You are protecting your children against abuse. That is one of the most important tasks for parents and you are doing the right thing.", "Please do some research into the term 'reactive abuse' and try to have some compassion for them. If they're not good for you, rightfully stay away. But humanize them from a distance. It'll help you heal too.\n\nEdit: 'them' being the family subjected to the abuse, not the abusers.", "Take what resonates. Ignore the rest. Simple as that.

My wife's mom is a bit selfish, and her dad drinks too much, but otherwise normal ish folks.\n\nMy dad is in complete denial still of some of the stuff my mom has done. He acknowledges the stuff she did to him, but if my brother and I talk about stuff from when we were kids, it's always \"that doesn't sound like her, you must be making it up\"", "I'm quite familiar with abuse, both from educational and experience points of view.\n\nYou have no idea whether or not I have compassion or need healing.", "Get bent!!", "Stop telling people how to handle their own abuse recovery.

Wtf are these comments?", "I think you should look up what kindness means, I don't think you've quite got it.", "Dude shut up, whole families can be abusive. If they want to stay with that abuser, then this person doesn\u2019t need to feel empathy. This person was abused. Period.
