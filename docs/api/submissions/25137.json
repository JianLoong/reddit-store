I did not. We talked about it for years before finally getting one 3 years ago. Before getting one we talked about all the rules we would have and how we would train the dog. 1 was the dog wouldn't be allowed on the couch unless specifically invited. 2 was the dog would not be allowed in our bed. Ever. Those were two very important boundaries of mine. I made it super clear how I felt about it. He agreed that he would follow those rules.\n\nFlash forward 3 years later. I literally cannot ever cuddle or snuggle with my husband on our couch because this dog is constantly in his lap and it's not a pomeranian... it's a 75lb weimaraner. Even on the rare occasion we do start to get close and snuggle... here comes the dog just right up on top of us, no hesitation, no permission needed. Because my husband caved to that rule immediately and says stupid shit like \"awe he just wants to be a part of the family.\" And I'm like \"we literally bought a $180 orthopedic dog bed that's 3ft away for him to have somewhere equally comfy.\" \n\nNow the worst part. My bed. Just like the couch every time I left for work or left the room my husband invites the dog into bed. It's gone on so long the dog thinks our bed is his bed and I'm so repulsed by it that I cannot even put it into words how much it disgusts me. \n\nI'm drawing the line. If he wants to sleep with the dog they can share the guest room.\n\nMy husband says I'm over reacting.\n\nAITA?\n\n[Edit for context]  for all those saying I should have said something sooner or I shouldn't have waited so long to put a stop to it... I have not been silent. I have stated time and time again how much it bothers me. I've even left the couch and left the room myself. I am currently sleeping in the basement while the dog takes my side of the bed. Probably never going back up there.

That\u2019s not okay.", "NTA. You've established clear boundaries with your husband, and he chooses to constantly blur those lines.. that's very disrespectful to you.

And I wash all of the bedding regularly.", "NTA for setting initial boundaries but YTA for trying to enforce them years later. The dog has learned where it is allowed and it's going to go there.

Except it wasn\u2019t explicitly said prescriptively before getting the dog. I lvoe  my dog - and i absolutely love sleeping with my dog on the bed. It\u2019s the sense of calm I need and honestly it\u2019s hard to sleep without her now. \n\nin your case NTA though. It was prescriptive in advance. It sounds like you\u2019ve given up the couch but the bed is a sticking point. \n\nI might suggest that, since this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, you find a way to cope with a middle ground. After multiple years of fighting we now put an extra blanket/sheet on the foot of the bed and have taught the dog that that\u2019s her place. She stays on her blanket (99% of the time) and the top blanket/ sheet is swapped out twice a week. Then washed separately because my dog sheds. It gives us both a middle ground to survive. We also got a king bed so the dog is on my side 100% of the time and doesn\u2019t disturb my partner.", "NTA\nAlthough I grew up with dogs & my own kids grew up with them, no dog was ever allowed in the bed. That rule is reasonable, especially for a large dog who is not well trained. \n\nThe biggest concern is a spouse who cares so little about violating your boundaries & is ok with you sleeping in another part of the house.

So we have a rule that dogs are only in the bed when he is not there or if he decides he\u2019s okay with it- like during fireworks or thunderstorms\u2026 he\u2019s not a monster. And we have a bed cover that is for the dogs so they don\u2019t mess up sheets and our comforter. Wouldnt that work for you? \n\nAlternatively (and this is sneaky) you can say sure they can be in bed. Initiated sexy time and insist they are in bed. \n\nMy big dog tried to join in during a blow job\u2026. That was enough for me so that\u2019s when I realized a compromise was necessary.", "Well there's more context we live in a desert and the 3rd level the master is on has been 75-80 degrees at night so I really moved down there because 68 is optimal sleeping temp for me. Then just decided to stay because it solves my dog problem. And I'm sleeping way better with the temp. So to me it's a win win for right now. \n\nAnd I just want to add I love your last line, very well written. That is exactly how it feels, never thought of it like that, so thank you for that input.", "Oh I haven't been silent this whole time, it's a constant argument from the very beginning of him going back on the rules.

My dog is welcome in bed, on the couch, wherever. I\u2019m fine with it. He was my wife\u2019s dog before we got together and if I weren\u2019t okay with it we would never have stayed together.", "Totally agree.", "It is not \"repulsive\" to have a dog sleep on your bed.  OP does not bother to explain what is \"repulsing her.\"  Is she repulsed that her HUSBAND disrespected her rules?  The Dog can't help that.    Why did she wait THREE YEARS to complain?      \n\nDogs  belong wherever their presence is permitted.  However, it should be a shared decision and it sounds like OP set out her parameters beforehand.  interestingly tho, seems like the dog is not on the bed when OP is there.  Rather, when she goes to work.  So this part is confusing.  If the dog is on the bed when she's a work, what is the real issue?  Does the bedding need to be washed?  How does she even know when the dog is on the bed.  Another brilliantly written complaint on Reddit.", "That's not why she's NTA lmao. \n\nPeople who like to have their dog on the bed are free to choose that and they're not wrong to like it.\n\nShe's NTA because she vocalised that boundary before they got the dog, reiterated it after they got the dog and has made it clear that it's not something that she's willing to accept and the husband is continuing to violate that boundary.", "LOL.

What do you mean \"how do I know the dog was in the bed?\" There's dog hair obviously. Yeah the bedding has to be washed constantly because of it because it's disgusting and guess who that falls to? Me! The only one of the 3 of us that sees it as a problem. And hahahaha I did not wait 3 years to complain I've been protesting this since the beginning. It's a constant argument.
