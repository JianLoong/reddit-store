I did not. We talked about it for years before finally getting one 3 years ago. Before getting one we talked about all the rules we would have and how we would train the dog. 1 was the dog wouldn't be allowed on the couch unless specifically invited. 2 was the dog would not be allowed in our bed. Ever. Those were two very important boundaries of mine. I made it super clear how I felt about it. He agreed that he would follow those rules.\n\nFlash forward 3 years later. I literally cannot ever cuddle or snuggle with my husband on our couch because this dog is constantly in his lap and it's not a pomeranian... it's a 75lb weimaraner. Even on the rare occasion we do start to get close and snuggle... here comes the dog just right up on top of us, no hesitation, no permission needed. Because my husband caved to that rule immediately and says stupid shit like \"awe he just wants to be a part of the family.\" And I'm like \"we literally bought a $180 orthopedic dog bed that's 3ft away for him to have somewhere equally comfy.\" \n\nNow the worst part. My bed. Just like the couch every time I left for work or left the room my husband invites the dog into bed. It's gone on so long the dog thinks our bed is his bed and I'm so repulsed by it that I cannot even put it into words how much it disgusts me. \n\nI'm drawing the line. If he wants to sleep with the dog they can share the guest room.\n\nMy husband says I'm over reacting.\n\nAITA?\n\n[Edit for context]  for all those saying I should have said something sooner or I shouldn't have waited so long to put a stop to it... I have not been silent. I have stated time and time again how much it bothers me. I've even left the couch and left the room myself. I am currently sleeping in the basement while the dog takes my side of the bed. Probably never going back up there.

It\u2019s the sense of calm I need and honestly it\u2019s hard to sleep without her now. \n\nin your case NTA though. It was prescriptive in advance. It sounds like you\u2019ve given up the couch but the bed is a sticking point. \n\nI might suggest that, since this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, you find a way to cope with a middle ground. After multiple years of fighting we now put an extra blanket/sheet on the foot of the bed and have taught the dog that that\u2019s her place. She stays on her blanket (99% of the time) and the top blanket/ sheet is swapped out twice a week. Then washed separately because my dog sheds. It gives us both a middle ground to survive.

And we have a bed cover that is for the dogs so they don\u2019t mess up sheets and our comforter. Wouldnt that work for you? \n\nAlternatively (and this is sneaky) you can say sure they can be in bed.

However, it should be a shared decision and it sounds like OP set out her parameters beforehand.  interestingly tho, seems like the dog is not on the bed when OP is there.

I have a dog and so does my boyfriend. When it\u2019s just me and my dog here, she can sleep on my bed. But she knows \u201cgo to your bed\u201d and will go sleep on her own bed, So when he\u2019s here, no dogs sleep on the bed. Same with his dog. \n\nAnd sofa time, his dog can get snappy if you wake him up from his sleep so he\u2019s not really allowed on the couch in the evening just cause it sets up a bad scenario - he has a cozy dog bed. My dog is allowed up if she\u2019s invited up. Usually he invites her up half the time anyway cause she\u2019s cuddly and his dog isn\u2019t! \n\nBut - she knows \u201coff\u201d. Both people need to agree about dogs on or off the furniture. With that, it\u2019s good that dogs are trained \u201coff\u201d and will get off the furniture when asked. We don\u2019t care about the dogs up on the couch if we\u2019re just playing video games or something but if we\u2019re cuddling and watching a movie sometimes we don\u2019t want any dogs on the couch. \n\nAnd two adults sleeping with a 75 pound dog on the bed sounds pretty miserable unless you have a massive king bed and the dog curls up small.

But you\u2019ve got other things to think about.  I would also not agree to having a dog sleep in my bed (or cat).

Maybe that\u2019s weird to some people, but I\u2019m not going to make myself miserable to look good to people who love having their animals take over the house.

Dog lover who also cannot cuddle without leaving room for the doggy, I wouldn\u2019t want it another way, but that was mutually decided.

She can sleep with them in one of the guest rooms or sit with them on the couch in her home office.\n\nBut not mine.

Your husband broke his agreement with you. That makes him the asshole. He needs to retrain the dog to follow your agreement, and not give in to the dog\u2019s demanding, whining, or wistful puppy eyes.\n\nThat being said, you are not endearing yourself by calling animals gross, when sleeping with pets in bed is a highly normalized practice across the world. It doesn\u2019t have to be *your* practice. But calling it disgusting is losing sight of the value animals have for other people and the role they occupy in wider western culture, and it may be making it hard for you to understand the value the dog has to your husband. \n\nAnd if we can see how much you despise and are repulsed by the dog, your husband probably can too, and it probably impacts his feelings for you and makes him feel you\u2019re unfairly hateful toward what he considers to be a beloved family member. I know that if my spouse spoke that way about my pet, it would be over. When you\u2019re the type of person who sees and treats a pet as a family member (as your husband does), it is very hard to respect someone who finds them disgusting.\n\nYou are morally in the right for wanting your husband to uphold your agreement and respect your needs.

In a more caring relationship, you'd have thought you're fine with him getting one if it's what he really wants, he'd have said no because you don't and you just wouldn't get one. \n\nBut you've missed something out here. The fact that you got a dog in the first place after you specifically said no taught him that you saying no to something doesn't mean anything because you might just cave anyway. \n\nYou said no to the dog, then said yes with boundaries. He breaks those boundaries, you say sleep in the guest room, he says you're overreacting.\n\nNext he'll bring the dog back in then when you say that's it it's final he'll say it's fine you'll calm down in a minute (and drop the entire thing and let him have what he wants)\n\nHe basically learned that he can have anything with you even if you say no so long as he waits, or you say your stipulations and if he says he agrees, he can calm you down before doing what he wants anyway.\n\nSit down and tell him the truth, the whole thing. You didn't want a dog, you compromised for him, and he didn't compromise for you by deciding not to get one or agreeing to your terms. He didn't think about your feelings. \n\nHe's selfish and only caring about himself with the dog and not listening when you said you didn't want one and not listening when you say your terms. \n\nYou could teach him what it's like.
