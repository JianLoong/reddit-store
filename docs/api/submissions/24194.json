We both have kids from previous relationships.  I have a daughter who just turned 18 a couple weeks ago and my husband has 2 sons (12 & 10).  I have sole custody of my daughter, her dad isn't involved in her life anymore.  My husband has split custody of his sons, but they primarily live with their mother during the school year.  They are currently staying with us for 2 months before school starts again.  \n\nMy daughter is going to be a senior in high school this fall. This past weekend, she went to a party with some friends.  I give her a fair amount of freedom regarding curfew, especially now that she's 18 and technically an adult.  So, I don't wait up for her to get home. We do however have a doorbell camera.  \n\nThe morning after the party, my husband had a notification on his phone from the door cam from when my daughter got home.  He told me I need to see it and showed me a video of my daughter stumbling up to the door, obviously intoxicated in some way.  Obviously, I don't condone teenage drinking or drug use, but I'm not stupid to think it doesn't happen.  I've talked to my daughter about it before and have always told her to call me if she ever feels unsafe or can't drive.  She did not drive that particular night, I know a friend drove.  \n\nI told my husband that I would talk to her about it when she wakes up.  But he wanted to wake her up and search her room because he was convinced she wasn't just drunk.  He said he needs to know if she has drugs or anything else in the house because he doesn't want his sons to find anything.  I told him I will not allow him to search my daughter's room and that I will talk to her.  I told him she's an 18-year-old young woman and we need to respect her privacy.  I told him he needs to let me handle this.  \n\nHe was not pleased with my approach and told me that he knows teenagers aren't complete idiots and that my daughter will probably just lie if she does have anything else in the house and the only way to know for sure is to search her room and car.  He said he knows she's technically an adult, but she's still living under our roof and there are young kids in the house and he doesn't want them getting into something bad.  I told him that there's no reason for his sons to be in my daughter's room or car anyway, so even if she does have something hidden, his sons shouldn't be rummaging through her room anyway.   \n\nHe did end up letting me talk to my daughter and she admitted to drinking, but denied doing anything else.  She said her friend was a sober driver and that she didn't have anything hidden in her room that her stepbrothers could possibly find.  We had a long talk about making good choices and the consequences of bad choices.  I also punished her by taking away her car for 2 weeks except for going to work.  \n\nMy husband is still upset that I didn't let him search her room, he thinks she just told me what I want to hear.

There were still consequences for her actions, and it sounds like she may be able to be open with you in the event something goes wrong or she needs help. Your husbands approach is the way to get people to lie, however.", "NTA and I think you should make him take a step back here. She is now 18 and did drink, but his strong reaction is overdramatic. And I have a suspicion that he will check her room as soon as he has the house for himself.", "NTA. You handled the situation pretty well. It's your daughter's turf and privacy we're talking about, and you showed her respect by having a conversation instead of going all FBI on her room.\r  \n\r  \nYour husband's concern about his sons finding stuff is valid, but trust goes both ways. If your daughter says she's got things under control, giving her that trust can actually help her keep things in check.\r  \n\r  \nBottom line, you did the responsible parent thing by talking it out and setting up some consequences. Your husband might need a bit more convincing that trust is a two-way street, but you're on the right track.", "Nealy everywhere else on the planet your daughter would be able to have a drink except in the US, which is where I am assuming you are.

He's definitely invading on her privacy. Good on you for not allowing that. NTA", "NTA, searching a kids room should be when something is seriously off, not a drunk 18 year old Also he could teach the boys to not go in other people\u2019s space", "NAH - you both had different takes on a situation, talked it out and good parenting was the result. It sounds like there\u2019s another conversation that needs to happen to get both of you on the same page and to address any lingering disagreements or hurt feelings but nothing major.", "NTA, she is your adult daughter. Get her a lock for her door that only you and she has a copy of. Keep your copy in your purse or on your person so your husband can't get a hold of it.

If he wanted her room searched he would have said you do it then when you pushed back/said no to him doing it. \n\nConsider that...

They wanted to ground me. No way. I moved out and I've never regretted it.", "NTA. Way to stick to your guns, mom.", "NTA for the searching thing, but grounding her for drinking at 18 is a pretty asshole move tbh.", ">  I also punished her by taking away her car for 2 weeks except for going to work. \n\nINFO: What did you punish her for?! It makes no sense. You spent your whole post explaining how and why you comprehend that her behavior (at 18) is entirely normal and quite in-character. Also confirming that she didn't have drugs nor did she drive under the influence...\n\nSo, what's the punishment for?", "NTA. I'm willing to bet that he would definitely be in the same position had the roles been reversed. His kids are young now. Give them a few years and he'll see that they're no different.

Thank you for sticking up for your daughter and her privacy. She will really thank you for that one day.", "You are right he is wrong.", "NTA.  Husband is acting...strangely here.  Beyond normal concern for the younger children.  Curious if he's always hard on the daughter or eager to dive into her stuff.  That and his search isn't likely to have the impact he thinks it will.", "NTA \n\nIf anyone was going to search her room, it should not be her step father, but her own mother.", "NTA If she's generally a good kid and you have a good relationship where you can openly communicate, there's no reason to search her room. It sounds like you explained the consequences of her getting caught or of bringing things into the home, and that's enough for now. \n\nIt's concerning that your husband is so fixated on wanting to violate her privacy.  Does he do that to his own kids or just her?", "NTA. But please get her a door knob with a keyed lock. She gets a key and you keep a key (but don't tell hubby that you also have a key.) Because 1) she deserves privacy, 2) the boys should not have access to her room without her approval, and 3) you don't want to deal with the fallout of hubby searching her room.", "NTA.  Unless you've seen other signs of drug use he is reaching.  It sounds like he just doesn't like her and wants her gone.

NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur partner is an AH.", "NTA you did everything right for the right reasons.  You're a good mum \n\nHis logic is authoritarian and flawed. If she did drugs, he thinks only HE can prove it by searching her room!?!  Why would she keep evidence in her room? Does he think she's a dealer? If she had 1  - 2 spare pills, to find it he'd have to search everything intimately eg you can hide those in the lining of your bra. He's sounding creepy.\n\ninvading her privacy and not trusting her could cause rebellion. With trust she'd possibly even tell you if she tried drugs. You should protect your daughter and keep her trust.. She's developing judgement . Well done!I Id put him on notice if he doesn't back down. If I was your daughter I'd hide a tiny camera in my room", "Goodness, the drama.  An 18 year old comes home drunk!  Hold on while I clutch my pearls!\n\nYour husband doesn't have the experience you have.  He's freaking out a little bit.  Kind of over nothing.  Although I doubt he would allow himself to be convinced of this.\n\nNTA.  Your daughter is fine.  Do not let your husband get into an adversarial relationship with your daughter.", "NTA. First of all, unless your daughter has a history of lying to you, where does your husband get off saying that she is definitely going to lie now? And, also unless she had been getting into drugs, why would she be bringing them into the house now when it looked like she was just drunk? He was jumping to a lot of conclusions. \n\nI think you handled things just fine, and you kept your husband from flying off the handle and turning a molehill into a mountain. Honestly, it sounded like he just wanted to throw around some masculine authority.", "Sounds to me  like he didn\u2019t wanna search her room for her own good. He was after that sweet sweet Chiba!", "Your 18 year old daughter made a bad choice. you talked to her and got the issue settled.\n\nI'm curious as to why your husband thinks that his 12 and 10 year old sons either don't know about or haven't tried drugs/alcohol. The elder son is right at the age where teens begin to experiment with smoking and alcohol. Is he willing to search their rooms as well?", "Your husband needs to learn about boundaries and how not to stomp on them. \n\nYou said you would handle it and his response should have been \"Ok, I trust you honey\".\n\nIf he doesn't trust your decision making then that is a different problem, and has nothing to do with your daughter. \n\nIt sounds like you need to have a discussion about parenting in blended families. This isn't something that should be left unsaid but discussed thoroughly. \n\nRegardless, NTA. Him and his boys need to stay out of her room.", "Even better idea!", "NTA. This right here is good parenting.", "NTA. You protected your daughters privacy from being invaded by someone who\u2019s only been in your life for a few years. She\u2019s an adult as well. He\u2019s heavy handed and is in for a shock when his boys start stretching themselves as teens and into adulthood as well", "I\u2019m hoping this is in the US cos in the UK the legal drinking age is 18 & I wouldn\u2019t \u201cground\u201d my son for drinking. Tbh he got drunk a week before his 18th & I had to pick him up. Didn\u2019t ground him. I just made sure he was okay & got him food once he\u2019d stopped hurling. He works damn hard mom-Fri 6am-3pm so I\u2019m certainly not going to punish him for having a drink (now he\u2019s legal I definitely wouldn\u2019t)", "NTA\n\nSearching her room isn't going to accomplish anything (even if you find drugs or something, it's easily replaceable) other than drive a wedge between her and you (and your husband), make her not trust you anymore/lie/keep more secrets and push her right out the door as soon as she can find somewhere else to go.  The approach you are taking is going to get you better results in the long run by showing some mutual respect for her.", ">I also punished her by taking away her car for 2 weeks except for going to work.\n\nHow do you justify this? She is an adult. Your parenting days, where you can take her things away as punishment, are gone.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband definitely is. If you want to stay close to your daughter and to be a good influence in her life, you must stop your husband. If he pushes her away or makes her want to move out (she can probably find a boy to let her move in if she has no other choice), then you will have lost a daughter because of him.", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty wild to assume an 18yo is doing hard drugs because she came home drunk from a party one time. I'd be talking with your husband about where that concern is coming from.", "Your husband needs to back off his control freak tendencies. This is your daughter and you will handle it.", "Bruh if my mom caught me doing this she would not only search my room but take away any and everything that I care about for a month. You can be a little strict sometimes especially if she\u2019s still in high-school. After school it\u2019s a bit different i guess.", "NTA. Your husband isn\u2019t her parent, so he can go sit and sulk all he wants but it\u2019s your decision on how to handle things.", "NTA - Why is he so comfortable invading someone's privacy? Husband needs to calm down; why scorch the earth? Communication is always the best route.  \n\nI'm concerned how he will react as your daughter continues to explore life and his kids get older. He mirrors an authoritarian parenting style; good luck (serious). Best to you!", "NTA. I'd be a bit concerned about his eagerness to flex his perceived authority over your daughter.", "NTA, you where spot on with the \u201cyour sons shouldn\u2019t be rummaging around her room looking for things anyways\u201d it sounds like he wants to exert control, good on you for protecting her privacy.", "NTA. His oldest is one year away from a dreaded teenager. Will he be checking his eldest son's backpack and bags when he comes over? Will he be going to his ex-wife's house and demand to flip his room? He's making an awful lot of accusations on very little evidence. Yes, the doorbell camera showed that she was intoxicated; that doesn't automatically mean that she's doing drugs. \n\nAs far as his sons finding something, why would they be in her room or snooping through her possessions in the first place? Does he not believe in boundaries?\n\nYou're playing this right. You've had an open and ongoing dialog about drug and alcohol use. You've also discussed the consequences and issued a fair punishment. You have also shown your daughter that you are trustworthy person to open up to. Your husband has shown he is none of that and I feel sorry for his sons.", "NTA .. only America has these crazy 21 year old drinking rules, the rest of the world seem to handle drinking earlier just fine. Also just because she was stumbling in, does not equals drugs. Why would there be a need to search her room? Sounds like nothing on camera warrants that.", "NTA. So let\u2019s search the room and then what? Find something neither of you approves of and then give her an ultimatum to shape up or ship out? The motivating factor is more of an \u2018aha!\u2019 we got you and not one of genuine concern because regardless of what she has in her room, it really doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s practically an adult and while she is still living under your roof, she\u2019s no less entitled to the privacy you and your husband each expect in your own bedroom. \n\nAnd if he\u2019s concerned about his son\u2019s stumbling upon something they shouldn\u2019t, we\u2019ll\u2026.that\u2019s probably because they learned to snoop from him! She has a right to privacy just like the rest of you and is learning that consequences are a part of decision making. Perhaps hubby needs to be reminded of that part of life too.", "NTA. The reason he's convinced his kids would lie and hide everything from him is that he's so harsh with the punishments and distrust of his kids that they have no choice but to lie. Liars aren't born, they're made. Underage drinking is not a huge deal, especially when she's a legal adult, you handled it correctly by punishing her lightly for the drinking. The fact that she immediately fessed up sounds like she would have been honest if it was anything else. And your husband sounds so distrustful of your daughter that I don't think he was going to search her room out of concern. I think he wanted to do it as a punishment. And then if he didn't find anything, he would yell at her for hiding what he was sure was there so well. That's not concern, it's punishment. You only violate a teenager's privacy as a last resort. Light underage drinking and then coming home with a sober driver isn't even remotely close to where that line should be.", "NTA While she may indeed just be telling you what you want to hear, invading her privacy is far more likely to make her start hiding things from you in the future (regardless of whether she's a teenager or technically an adult).

The dad came home and caught them smoking in the backyard.  I talked with my daughter about it and she said she doesn't like the way weed makes her feel and that she didn't want to do it again.  My husband thinks this is just another example of my daughter telling me what I want to hear.", "Kids get arrested for underage drinking all the time here. What? \n\nhttps://letmegooglethat.com/?q=kids+arrested+for+underage+drinking", ">Again, it sounds like your husband has a case of \u201cI\u2019m the MAN of the house!\u201d And felt the need to beat his chest.\n\nMaybe a little of this, but he thinks I'm being hypocritical because I told him that I caught my ex cheating by looking through his phone.  He told me that I justified that invasion of privacy based on what I found.  He doesn't see how this is any different.", "Could she be telling you what you want to hear? Maybe. I didn\u2019t like how cannabis made me feel, so I smoked it twice and beyond a couple edibles after that, I haven\u2019t touched it since. Cannabis isn\u2019t like cocaine or heroin in how it\u2019s addictive.", "Hope he remembers to act this way when his sons come home drunk/high.", "I don't think you have anything to worry about. Most kids that are sufficiently social are going to try substances that aren't hard and scary, and a lot of the times they're just not going to like them. I wasn't super into alcohol or weed either, even though I could have easily gotten into something at every party. The kids that did hit the drugs hard usually had a reason, like a bad home life or they were dating someone, usually older, that got them hooked. Most of the time, any sufficiently busy kid isn't going to want to partake that much anyway because it's seriously a hassle to get that stuff underage, hide it from your parents, and then sufficiently sober up and get your clothes to stop smelling before you show up for work or school. If she's around you for hours every day or has a job, she's not going to have time to hide it unless she's sufficiently motivated to be an addict. Most kids aren't."]}
