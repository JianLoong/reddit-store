We both have kids from previous relationships.  I have a daughter who just turned 18 a couple weeks ago and my husband has 2 sons (12 & 10).  I have sole custody of my daughter, her dad isn't involved in her life anymore.  My husband has split custody of his sons, but they primarily live with their mother during the school year.  They are currently staying with us for 2 months before school starts again.  \n\nMy daughter is going to be a senior in high school this fall. This past weekend, she went to a party with some friends.  I give her a fair amount of freedom regarding curfew, especially now that she's 18 and technically an adult.  So, I don't wait up for her to get home. We do however have a doorbell camera.  \n\nThe morning after the party, my husband had a notification on his phone from the door cam from when my daughter got home.  He told me I need to see it and showed me a video of my daughter stumbling up to the door, obviously intoxicated in some way.  Obviously, I don't condone teenage drinking or drug use, but I'm not stupid to think it doesn't happen.  I've talked to my daughter about it before and have always told her to call me if she ever feels unsafe or can't drive.  She did not drive that particular night, I know a friend drove.  \n\nI told my husband that I would talk to her about it when she wakes up.  But he wanted to wake her up and search her room because he was convinced she wasn't just drunk.  He said he needs to know if she has drugs or anything else in the house because he doesn't want his sons to find anything.  I told him I will not allow him to search my daughter's room and that I will talk to her.  I told him she's an 18-year-old young woman and we need to respect her privacy.  I told him he needs to let me handle this.  \n\nHe was not pleased with my approach and told me that he knows teenagers aren't complete idiots and that my daughter will probably just lie if she does have anything else in the house and the only way to know for sure is to search her room and car.  He said he knows she's technically an adult, but she's still living under our roof and there are young kids in the house and he doesn't want them getting into something bad.  I told him that there's no reason for his sons to be in my daughter's room or car anyway, so even if she does have something hidden, his sons shouldn't be rummaging through her room anyway.   \n\nHe did end up letting me talk to my daughter and she admitted to drinking, but denied doing anything else.  She said her friend was a sober driver and that she didn't have anything hidden in her room that her stepbrothers could possibly find.  We had a long talk about making good choices and the consequences of bad choices.  I also punished her by taking away her car for 2 weeks except for going to work.  \n\nMy husband is still upset that I didn't let him search her room, he thinks she just told me what I want to hear.

There were still consequences for her actions, and it sounds like she may be able to be open with you in the event something goes wrong or she needs help. Your husbands approach is the way to get people to lie, however.", "NTA and I think you should make him take a step back here. She is now 18 and did drink, but his strong reaction is overdramatic. And I have a suspicion that he will check her room as soon as he has the house for himself.", "NTA. You handled the situation pretty well. It's your daughter's turf and privacy we're talking about, and you showed her respect by having a conversation instead of going all FBI on her room.\r  \n\r  \nYour husband's concern about his sons finding stuff is valid, but trust goes both ways. If your daughter says she's got things under control, giving her that trust can actually help her keep things in check.\r  \n\r  \nBottom line, you did the responsible parent thing by talking it out and setting up some consequences. Your husband might need a bit more convincing that trust is a two-way street, but you're on the right track.", "Nealy everywhere else on the planet your daughter would be able to have a drink except in the US, which is where I am assuming you are.

He's definitely invading on her privacy. Good on you for not allowing that. NTA", "NTA, searching a kids room should be when something is seriously off, not a drunk 18 year old Also he could teach the boys to not go in other people\u2019s space", "NAH - you both had different takes on a situation, talked it out and good parenting was the result. It sounds like there\u2019s another conversation that needs to happen to get both of you on the same page and to address any lingering disagreements or hurt feelings but nothing major.", "NTA, she is your adult daughter. Get her a lock for her door that only you and she has a copy of. Keep your copy in your purse or on your person so your husband can't get a hold of it.

If he wanted her room searched he would have said you do it then when you pushed back/said no to him doing it. \n\nConsider that...

They wanted to ground me. No way. I moved out and I've never regretted it.", "NTA. Way to stick to your guns, mom.", "NTA for the searching thing, but grounding her for drinking at 18 is a pretty asshole move tbh.", ">  I also punished her by taking away her car for 2 weeks except for going to work. \n\nINFO: What did you punish her for?! It makes no sense. You spent your whole post explaining how and why you comprehend that her behavior (at 18) is entirely normal and quite in-character. Also confirming that she didn't have drugs nor did she drive under the influence...\n\nSo, what's the punishment for?", "NTA. I'm willing to bet that he would definitely be in the same position had the roles been reversed. His kids are young now. Give them a few years and he'll see that they're no different.

Thank you for sticking up for your daughter and her privacy. She will really thank you for that one day.", "You are right he is wrong.", "NTA.  Husband is acting...strangely here.  Beyond normal concern for the younger children.  Curious if he's always hard on the daughter or eager to dive into her stuff.  That and his search isn't likely to have the impact he thinks it will.", "NTA \n\nIf anyone was going to search her room, it should not be her step father, but her own mother.", "NTA If she's generally a good kid and you have a good relationship where you can openly communicate, there's no reason to search her room. It sounds like you explained the consequences of her getting caught or of bringing things into the home, and that's enough for now. \n\nIt's concerning that your husband is so fixated on wanting to violate her privacy.  Does he do that to his own kids or just her?", "NTA. But please get her a door knob with a keyed lock. She gets a key and you keep a key (but don't tell hubby that you also have a key.) Because 1) she deserves privacy, 2) the boys should not have access to her room without her approval, and 3) you don't want to deal with the fallout of hubby searching her room.", "NTA.  Unless you've seen other signs of drug use he is reaching.  It sounds like he just doesn't like her and wants her gone.

NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur partner is an AH.", "NTA you did everything right for the right reasons.  You're a good mum \n\nHis logic is authoritarian and flawed. If she did drugs, he thinks only HE can prove it by searching her room!?!  Why would she keep evidence in her room? Does he think she's a dealer? If she had 1  - 2 spare pills, to find it he'd have to search everything intimately eg you can hide those in the lining of your bra. He's sounding creepy.\n\ninvading her privacy and not trusting her could cause rebellion. With trust she'd possibly even tell you if she tried drugs. You should protect your daughter and keep her trust.. She's developing judgement . Well done!I Id put him on notice if he doesn't back down. If I was your daughter I'd hide a tiny camera in my room", "Goodness, the drama.  An 18 year old comes home drunk!  Hold on while I clutch my pearls!\n\nYour husband doesn't have the experience you have.  He's freaking out a little bit.  Kind of over nothing.  Although I doubt he would allow himself to be convinced of this.\n\nNTA.  Your daughter is fine.  Do not let your husband get into an adversarial relationship with your daughter.", "NTA. First of all, unless your daughter has a history of lying to you, where does your husband get off saying that she is definitely going to lie now? And, also unless she had been getting into drugs, why would she be bringing them into the house now when it looked like she was just drunk? He was jumping to a lot of conclusions. \n\nI think you handled things just fine, and you kept your husband from flying off the handle and turning a molehill into a mountain. Honestly, it sounded like he just wanted to throw around some masculine authority.", "Sounds to me  like he didn\u2019t wanna search her room for her own good. He was after that sweet sweet Chiba!", "Your 18 year old daughter made a bad choice. you talked to her and got the issue settled.\n\nI'm curious as to why your husband thinks that his 12 and 10 year old sons either don't know about or haven't tried drugs/alcohol. The elder son is right at the age where teens begin to experiment with smoking and alcohol. Is he willing to search their rooms as well?", "Your husband needs to learn about boundaries and how not to stomp on them. \n\nYou said you would handle it and his response should have been \"Ok, I trust you honey\".\n\nIf he doesn't trust your decision making then that is a different problem, and has nothing to do with your daughter. \n\nIt sounds like you need to have a discussion about parenting in blended families. This isn't something that should be left unsaid but discussed thoroughly. \n\nRegardless, NTA. Him and his boys need to stay out of her room.", "Even better idea!", "NTA. This right here is good parenting.", "NTA. You protected your daughters privacy from being invaded by someone who\u2019s only been in your life for a few years. She\u2019s an adult as well. He\u2019s heavy handed and is in for a shock when his boys start stretching themselves as teens and into adulthood as well", "I\u2019m hoping this is in the US cos in the UK the legal drinking age is 18 & I wouldn\u2019t \u201cground\u201d my son for drinking. Tbh he got drunk a week before his 18th & I had to pick him up. Didn\u2019t ground him. I just made sure he was okay & got him food once he\u2019d stopped hurling. He works damn hard mom-Fri 6am-3pm so I\u2019m certainly not going to punish him for having a drink (now he\u2019s legal I definitely wouldn\u2019t)", "NTA\n\nSearching her room isn't going to accomplish anything (even if you find drugs or something, it's easily replaceable) other than drive a wedge between her and you (and your husband), make her not trust you anymore/lie/keep more secrets and push her right out the door as soon as she can find somewhere else to go.  The approach you are taking is going to get you better results in the long run by showing some mutual respect for her.", ">I also punished her by taking away her car for 2 weeks except for going to work.\n\nHow do you justify this? She is an adult. Your parenting days, where you can take her things away as punishment, are gone.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband definitely is. If you want to stay close to your daughter and to be a good influence in her life, you must stop your husband. If he pushes her away or makes her want to move out (she can probably find a boy to let her move in if she has no other choice), then you will have lost a daughter because of him.", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty wild to assume an 18yo is doing hard drugs because she came home drunk from a party one time. I'd be talking with your husband about where that concern is coming from.", "Your husband needs to back off his control freak tendencies. This is your daughter and you will handle it.", "Bruh if my mom caught me doing this she would not only search my room but take away any and everything that I care about for a month. You can be a little strict sometimes especially if she\u2019s still in high-school. After school it\u2019s a bit different i guess.", "NTA. Your husband isn\u2019t her parent, so he can go sit and sulk all he wants but it\u2019s your decision on how to handle things.", "NTA - Why is he so comfortable invading someone's privacy? Husband needs to calm down; why scorch the earth? Communication is always the best route.  \n\nI'm concerned how he will react as your daughter continues to explore life and his kids get older. He mirrors an authoritarian parenting style; good luck (serious). Best to you!", "NTA. I'd be a bit concerned about his eagerness to flex his perceived authority over your daughter.", "NTA, you where spot on with the \u201cyour sons shouldn\u2019t be rummaging around her room looking for things anyways\u201d it sounds like he wants to exert control, good on you for protecting her privacy.", "NTA. His oldest is one year away from a dreaded teenager. Will he be checking his eldest son's backpack and bags when he comes over? Will he be going to his ex-wife's house and demand to flip his room? He's making an awful lot of accusations on very little evidence. Yes, the doorbell camera showed that she was intoxicated; that doesn't automatically mean that she's doing drugs. \n\nAs far as his sons finding something, why would they be in her room or snooping through her possessions in the first place? Does he not believe in boundaries?\n\nYou're playing this right. You've had an open and ongoing dialog about drug and alcohol use. You've also discussed the consequences and issued a fair punishment. You have also shown your daughter that you are trustworthy person to open up to. Your husband has shown he is none of that and I feel sorry for his sons.", "NTA .. only America has these crazy 21 year old drinking rules, the rest of the world seem to handle drinking earlier just fine. Also just because she was stumbling in, does not equals drugs. Why would there be a need to search her room? Sounds like nothing on camera warrants that.", "NTA. So let\u2019s search the room and then what? Find something neither of you approves of and then give her an ultimatum to shape up or ship out? The motivating factor is more of an \u2018aha!\u2019 we got you and not one of genuine concern because regardless of what she has in her room, it really doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s practically an adult and while she is still living under your roof, she\u2019s no less entitled to the privacy you and your husband each expect in your own bedroom. \n\nAnd if he\u2019s concerned about his son\u2019s stumbling upon something they shouldn\u2019t, we\u2019ll\u2026.that\u2019s probably because they learned to snoop from him! She has a right to privacy just like the rest of you and is learning that consequences are a part of decision making. Perhaps hubby needs to be reminded of that part of life too.", "NTA. The reason he's convinced his kids would lie and hide everything from him is that he's so harsh with the punishments and distrust of his kids that they have no choice but to lie. Liars aren't born, they're made. Underage drinking is not a huge deal, especially when she's a legal adult, you handled it correctly by punishing her lightly for the drinking. The fact that she immediately fessed up sounds like she would have been honest if it was anything else. And your husband sounds so distrustful of your daughter that I don't think he was going to search her room out of concern. I think he wanted to do it as a punishment. And then if he didn't find anything, he would yell at her for hiding what he was sure was there so well. That's not concern, it's punishment. You only violate a teenager's privacy as a last resort. Light underage drinking and then coming home with a sober driver isn't even remotely close to where that line should be.", "NTA While she may indeed just be telling you what you want to hear, invading her privacy is far more likely to make her start hiding things from you in the future (regardless of whether she's a teenager or technically an adult).

Thats why teengers do dumb shit all the time.The whole idea that the younger kids shouldn't be in the room so it's not a problem is also pretty naive. Kids are kids, they do things they know they shouldn't. If they did get a hold of drugs your daughter was hiding it's kind of irrelevant if you have the moral high ground because they shouldn't have been in there. I think it's a difficult situation and talking to your daughter would be the best way forward. You need to set some clear boundaries about having drugs in the house and properly explain why it's so important.

I would say searching your daughters room may be for the best, but if you do it may be important to lay some ground rules and notify your daughter right before. Maybe explain the situation in full to your daughter and tell her you and your husband have found it necessary to search her dresser drawers, under her bed, and closet (isolating a few typical hiding spaces may be enough for your husband to feel at ease without completing violating your daughter\u2019s privacy).

Because if she has a drug history, it is very possible that she would just lie to you about not possessing or using drugs feeling like it was none of anybody's business and not think ahead that this may cost your husband custody of his children. Teenagers don't think like that and apparently you don't either.\n\nHate to say this but it is very accurate that teenagers sometimes tell you what you want to hear to keep doing what they want to do. They also don't always think ahead very well or realize the consequences of their actions.

What has she ever done aside from drink to make him think this? \n\nTo the point he would be going through her underwear to see if she has drugs. Again, why didn't he ask YOU to look through the room then once you said no to him? \n\nWhy has he suddenly lost all trust and respect for your daughter, that he would treat her this way and that he would let his paranoia extend to wanting to violate her safe space? \n\nI understand he has worries and the ex is a psycho, but why is your daughter being outright punished for the potential actions of your husband's ex? Why is she being punished for your husband's exs instability?", "It sounds like he\u2019s reactive and basing his behavior on fear. Fear of losing custody of his sons. But the rest of you can\u2019t live reacting to his fears. \n\nI think the best thing you can do is to \nA. Have a conversation with your daughter and explain why husband might be concerned \nB. Get her a lock for her door. This way the boys have no way to get into her room when she\u2019s not there.", "So protect you daughter from their BS. Get her a lock for her door and don\u2019t leave it to chance. She shouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u201ccurious\u201d boys and a controlling man going through her stuff because of a crazy lady who doesn\u2019t even live there.", "Taking away your ADULT daughters autonomy and personal space is ridiculous. He needs to take a step back. going through her room is absolutely unacceptable.", "His kids also deserve privacy.", "Oh good, so he's just as overbearing and shitty to his own kids too... \ud83d\ude44", "You\u2019re incredibly naive, your daughter is definitely doing drugs and not telling you, considering those other facts you left out. You\u2019re risking your husband\u2019s custody on believing your teenage drug-using daughter\u2019s word. Stop being stupid and search her room or at least drug test her.", "Where's the coke info? I've only seen OP mention weed so far.", "He's married to the mother, it's his house now he has a right to know what's going on in it", "If your good buddy is a coke dealer at 18 would you be surprised if your parents were concerned?", "Our kid is exactly the same about it and we talk quite openly about stuff. Not everyone enjoys the feeling of being high. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f She\u2019s talking to you freely about what she has done and sounds pretty sensible, I\u2019d explain to her about the custody issues with his ex so she knows to be extra cautious and tell him his paranoia does not mean he can invade her privacy. Offer to get her a lock on her door so the younger kids can\u2019t get in.\n\nETA: also the kids are old enough now that any family court will take their preferences into consideration re: custody. His ex\u2019s opportunities to cause trouble are shrinking by the second in that regard.", "I didn\u2019t like weed in high school either, it\u2019s totally possible.

We\u2019re talking about an actual adult drinking one night with no other indications of substance abuse. I\u2019m from a dry county and this seems kind of fantastic even by those standards. \n\nHonest question: do you or your husband ever drink?", "You shouldn\u2019t have invaded your ex\u2019s privacy either. That you made a mistake or a bad decision doesn\u2019t mean you have to repeat it.", "Yeah, kids do. Not entire families. I had $150 citation for it at 18, too. My point is if the stepdad was concerned about being legally liable for his stepdaughter drinking at a freinds house, that would be a stupid concern.", "Read the actual context of the conversation. No shit kids get in trouble for drinking while minors. That's not being refuted lol.", "Then it's his house hope she changes cuz my dad kicked my older brother out when he started drinking and he didn't like it .", "The problem is that while she is legally an adult, she is also a child attending high school.\n\nAnd I did not say \"no sex\", I suggest \"no locked door with company\".\n\nOP's daughter could still potentially have sex.  And I didn't say the door cannot be closed.\n\nNext time you read what someone writes, don't put words in their mouth.", "Except daughter got busted smoking weed last year. One of her close friends just got done for dealing Cocaine. And the husband has a contentious Ex who would love to have full custody of his sons.  The husbands fears are quite a lot more founded than OP has painted them in her original post. All that context is in her comments. This is much messier than first presented.", ">She\u2019s your daughter your call but I find it unfair you grounded her for having a good and safe time.\n\nThis.  She is a fucking ADULT.", "She took the car away, which OP possibly pays for? That's not exactly grounded.", "She's 18. That's legal drinking age where I am. I agree grounding is silly, but talking might be a good idea.\nETA to add NTA.", "Op admits to her daughter getting busted with hard drugs when she was 16/17 and her best friend is a drug dealer. So that leap isnt wild at all. And his concern is extremely valid. Why OP didnt put this info in the post is mindblowing.", "> Again, why didn't he ask YOU to look through the room then once you said no to him?\n\nHe did, I refused to do it or even ask my daughter.", "Yup. this man has no boundaries.", "it's just as much the daughter's house and she has the right to privacy and respect and her own space in her own house. Following your logic, can she also go through his things?", "OP\u2019s husband went through custody issues with his Ex. An Ex whom Op agrees is batshit crazy.\n\nOP\u2019s husband does not want any possibility of something happening that could lead to custody issues. I think OP\u2019s husband is perfectly reasonable in his worry (only his worry) especially since OP clarified her child\u2019s friend was recently busted for cocaine and weed dealing. \n\nSo much ragging on OP\u2019s husband and it\u2019s like nobody read the circumstances. OP should consider a lock on daughters door and was right for refusing the search.

Their idea of drinking is half a hard cider. My dad hates how weed affects him, says he slept through too many good parties in college after only a hit or two. My mom, kid, wife, and I all partake, and he\u2019s just happy it works for us.", "Yeah, I would say stressing about wether your 18 yo child touches alcohol or drugs is basically pointless. \n\nIf you have happy, healthy kid, chances are it will only be a curiosity or a party enhancer for them. If your kid has stuff going on (home-wise, socially, medically, ect.) that makes escaping into drugs appealing, you should focus on those.\n\nAnd at that age, whether or not they do is out of your hands anyway. You can make it harder for them to do it, but you can't stop them without preventing them from leading a normal life (at which point they can just move out).\n\nIs she doing ok in school? Is she doing ok at work? Friend circle? No noticeable negative change in moods or behavior at home? She's most likely fine, regardless of whether or not she's abstaining.", "My husband doesn't drink.  He's been sober since his younger brother was killed by a drunk driver 12 years ago.  I, however, do like to drink.  My husband has never once stopped me from drinking though, he just abstains himself.", "Regardless of invasion of privacy is bad from anyone and I agree with your other part", "If they supplied the alcohol they do. But that's not what you said. You said kids have NEVER gotten arrested for underage drinking, and that's just patently false.", "The stepdad is specifically concerned that his ex might try to make a mountain out of a molehill if the daughter were to get anything like a citation. So the legal trouble isn\u2019t directly a result of the underage drinking.", "It\u2019s so wild to me that the US is like this. Pretty much everywhere else in the world you can drink at 18, in the US you can get a gun, enter into 6 figures worth of debt but god forbid you have a few beers. Most people in the UK are drinking in parks with dodgy adults from 14 and no one bats an eyelid but getting punished for being 18, having a few drinks with friends and having a safe lift home arranged with a trusted friend? I can\u2019t even begin to comprehend the thought process behind it.", "The drinking age in the US is 21 and she is a high school student. In many states parents can face jail time for providing alcohol or condoning underage drinking. I thin the mom is giving her a lot of respect and freedom, but she has a year of high school left where she will be living in Mom\u2019s home, so it makes sense there will be more active parenting than if she was away at college.", "Pretty sure the sound of my head hitting the desk could be heard from space.", "> I think OP\u2019s husband is perfectly reasonable in his worry\n\nyeah but his parental rights/responsibility does have limits. If OP doesn't want to allow him to snoop around, he can either respect that.. or he can remove himself and his children from that risk.", "He has no right to search her room but he has every reason to be worried. \n\n1. He fought a difficult custody battle and his ex would use any ammo she gets to restart the custody battle. \n\n\n2. Op's daughter was busted doing drugs last year \n\n\n3. The daughter's close friend was a dealer and was arrested last month with drugs.\n\n\nOp should have put these in her post.\n\n Any sane person in his position would doubt the daughter.

That's understandable, but also unfair to your daughter.", "Ah. Yes, I was getting that feeling. My sister died of liver failure. So I get it. \n\nFunny how being in a dry county didn\u2019t prevent her becoming an alcoholic. Which furthers the point though - not everybody that drinks has a problem. Drinking sporadically at 18 is not, in itself, an indication of a bigger problem. \n\nHere the problem. You know that and so does your husband. So what gives?", "No, I did not say that. Maybe re-read the thread. We're talking about legal issues \"for the family she lives with\" whilst the teenager comes home after drinking elsewhere. I'm not sure what you're going on about.", "When I was a teenager, my dad was always the dad who said \"I don't give a shit what you drink or have taken, if no one is sober, call me and I'll drive you and all your mates home no questions asked\". \n\nI don't want to be a parent but let me tell you, every group of teens needs that parent and even decades later I'm still glad my dad was that parent for us. \n\nI can't imagine being an 18-year-old adult and someone thinking they could violate my privacy because *I had a few too many drinks*. That's so ridiculous.", "Don't forget they can sign up for the Army or other armed forces at 18 too.  Some places are trying to raise the gun age to 21, but I agree, it's pretty ridiculous to trust 18-year-olds for EVERYTHING except alcohol.", "USA is flipping bonkers and in denial, imagine trying to punish a 18 year old over drinking at a party in the UK? You\u2019d get glassed", "It's funny how different countries are, I'm in Scotland, to drunk in a bar is 18, to drink beer online with a meal is 16 and your parents can allow you to have alcohol from the age of 5 in their own home", "She was busted smoking weed as a 17 year old I assume in her friends backyard, not smoking crack in a trap house.", "Always good advice not to get high on your own supply.", "Sounds like he\u2019s concerned about drugs in the household. The daughter can move too btw.", "Exactly, that makes it even worse. To be honest, I think a lot of reckless behaviour comes from alcohol not being legal until a certain age. When I was at school, we had various club nights/prom etc that you were allowed to drink at if over 18 but not if you were under 18. Which is fair enough, that\u2019s the law. Obviously. But those kind of events were always AWFUL for people turning up absolutely shitfaced because they weren\u2019t allowed to drink at the event so they would pregame HARD as to not sober up. The result was always around a dozen teenagers who arrived and were already clutching the toilet in no fit state to be there at all. On the flip side, house parties where people were underage but just drinking and pacing themselves and generally being a lot more chill were fine. Occasionally someone would drink too much but for the most part people would have a few drinks and go home tipsy but safe. Arguing against that is just going to encourage unsafe drinking behaviour imo.", "Right\u2026and the UK, particularly Scotland, is well above OECD averages as far as both alcohol consumed and proportion of problem drinkers. There are massive government initiatives all over the UK to try and curb the national trend of alcoholism.  No personal insult intended to you, but Scotland is not a great example of a country with a sane and healthy attitude about alcohol."]}
