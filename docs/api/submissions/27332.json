{"id": 27332, "submission_id": "16oih31", "title": "AITA for saying my dad failed me by moving too fast after my mom died?", "selftext": "I was 8 when I lost my mom to cancer. She knew her time was coming and I was told about it by my parents. It was a pretty traumatic time and some memories stuck while others faded. But I will always remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing my mom ask my dad to take time after she died to move on. She said she knew I would need that and he needed to be there for me and to put me first. She also admitted she was scared that he was going to forget about her because he wouldn't want to deal with his pain. She said she didn't want to be forgotten or replaced. I don't even remember if my dad said anything. But I knew my mom was crying while she was talking and I was crying too. She wasn't wrong. I had already started falling apart when I knew she wouldn't be there anymore.\n\nMy dad dated almost as soon as my mom was in the ground and 6 months later he introduced me to the woman who would be his second wife. There was no support for me during that time. He focused on doing everything mom feared he would. His second wife from the get go was like \"I'm going to marry your dad and I'll be his wife and your new mom\". The next few years were awful and I hated my dad for moving on so fast, too fast for me, and for doing his best to make mom the past and replace her with his second wife.\n\nIt was only 2 years ago when things got better. My grandparents intervened on my behalf after being ignored for years. It helped so much to have them step up and do what needed to be done for me. I was lost. Barely making it through school and my friendships were almost non-existent because I was so depressed. I actually ended up diagnosed with depression.\n\nMy dad's wife thought that would be when I would start coming around to her and letting her in. But I still have no interest in a second mom or pretending she's anything more than some woman my dad is married to. He doesn't really care either but he'll do whatever she wants so we all started therapy together a year ago and after four months the therapist wanted her to leave and for it to be just dad and me. It really hasn't been going anywhere. But then last week his wife was determined to join us again and the therapist was like, you know what, speak up (to me) and say everything you have said in our 1:1 sessions. So I did. I told my dad he failed me by moving on too fast. I said he betrayed mom by making sure her biggest fear came through and by not doing the right thing by me, the child she gave him, his only child. I said he was hardly a dad to me since mom got sick. I told him he hadn't realized I was depressed, he didn't seem to care either, and he pretty much spat on my mom's grave with his actions.\n\nThe therapist told him that he should care way more than he does and told his wife she unrealistic with her expectations and needed to let them go. It was afterward they both got mad and told me I had been cruel and not honest.\n\nI'm now at my grandparents house but they still text to say I'm wrong.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1695309179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oih31/aita_for_saying_my_dad_failed_me_by_moving_too/", "score": 1726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stories like this make me sad. I know marriage is til death do us part, but to see some people move on quicker following the death of a spouse than I do after a relationship puts into question how much love they truly had for their partner.

The erasure of their existence in a matter of a year or even less is truly heartbreaking.", "NTA,\n\nFirst off, I want to say no matter what, you cannot be in the wrong. Your father is an ADULT, you are his child. No matter what you do or did as a child, those actions reflect on HIM as a parent. \n\nInstead of letting you process your feelings, he let you down because he could not process his own. He should have been the example for you to be able to process, move on, and honor the life your mother had. \n\nYour step mother also should not have tried to take the place of your mother so soon, or even at all. That is your choice to make, and her spot to EARN if you feel she is fit for that position. Your mother cannot be replaced, and her trying to do that to you especially as a small child was just unfair. Your father thought that since he filled the woman shaped hole in his life, he could force you to do the same. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that he ignored you for so long,  it is not your fault and never will be. It is cowardice to say the least that he could not gain the strength to be there for himself let alone his child. He had a responsibility to make sure you were not alone. \n\nGood on you for taking your time to process like your mother wanted, she knew what was best for you.

People are allowed to grieve however they need to, and if that means he moves on quickly, then so be it. His obligation is until death, and he's fulfilled that. There's also a possibility he had been grieving for some time even though his late wife was still alive. When your the primary care giver, you see the decline in health firsthand, and you can kinda accept the inevitable and start grieving, even before they're actually passed. So you need to accept that your dad is/has grieved in his own way and he is allowed to be happy with someone else. \n\nThat being said though, he did fail you as a parent. You were old enough to decide what kind of relationship you wanted with your step mom, and he didn't come to bat for you when she trampled your boundaries. He didn't consider at all how you were grieving or even your well being. It sounds like he is only considering what his current wife wants, and she wants to play happy family. They probably wanted to do family therapy with the expectation that it would get you to acquiesce to her wishes, but now it's backfiring on them, and now they're pissed.", "NTA because the fact of the matter is your father neglected to do right by you.\n\n\nhowever, I think it's unrealistic to expect another person to refrain from \"moving on too soon.\"\n\nyou don't know what's going on in his head\n\n\nyou don't know what's going on with his heart\n\n\nif companionship is what helps him then he shouldn't feel like he's doing anything wrong for that, nor should others put the expectation on him to refrain.\n\n\nwhile that doesn't give him a free pass to fail to support you, I don't see how he can't, on principle, do one *or* the other", "NTA. \n\nWhen it comes to being upset about how your mom would feel, you need to let it go.

That woman pushed her being a replacement for your mom on you, and your dad didn\u2019t step in or do anything. Your father did fail you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that he didn\u2019t consider your feelings. You deserved time and space to grieve instead of being bombarded with the idea of a replacement. \n\nYour father could have found happiness with someone else without pushing that happiness onto a young kid who just lost their mother. He didn\u2019t have to move that fast, and he should have at least *thought* about how it would impact you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you at all if you distanced yourself from him and eventually went low contact or no contact.

How long would have been sufficient in your eyes?\n\nI always find it disturbing when people try to judge what is an appropriate length of time before someone moves on with a new partner.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, let me shine a different light on your dad's emotions/behaviour. I don't think your dad intended to spit on your mum's grave directly, that was never his intention to make her a figure of the past - your dad freaked out the moment the reality hit he was losing his wife, he shut down, and probably has a lot of internal pain, anxiety, depression and grief to this day over your mum.\n\nHe did the \"man thing\" that your mum warned him not to do which is, he got up and carried on whilst ignoring his pain, grief, and all the emotions that came with losing his wife, the love of his life, and the mother of his child. Instead of going to therapy and allowing himself to heal his wounds, heartache, and pain, he shut himself off from his emotions and very much kept himself in the headspace of, \"got to keep going.\" Almost like being on a hamster wheel, and knowing that the moment you slow down, you'll get tripped up and floor it. Perhaps this is what your father has been doing? Keeping on going so that he never slows down enough for the momentum of emotions that are just crashing all up inside of him to actually catch up with him. It even sounds like your SM could just be a distraction, but obviously I don't know shit. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that if you heard your mum warn your father to not do what he's doing, I think she would only say it not because your father is heartless but because she knows that your father is emotionally detached from himself and his emotions. Which, if you have ever dealt with a man as such, trust me you know how their detached emotional sides can be their biggest weakness, hindrance etc. Wouldn't be surprised if your mum was probably your dad's biggest crutch and support emotionally and all.\n\nNow, this is all speculation because I don't know your father, but if it does resonate I hope it just shines a light on your father's behaviour after your mum passed. Like I said, I don't want to assume he's not being an asshole because he is, but grief is performed in different ways and avoidance is one. I also don't want you to feel like a throwaway child, when it could just be because your dad is an emotional avoidant dweeb lol.\n\nBut yeah, for now, stay with your Grandparents and work on yourself.  Otherwise, well done for your healing journey, well done for being outspoken about your emotions and I wish you all the best in life.\n\nEdit: grammar and that", "NAH.\n\nYou've got how you feel and how you grieve, but people aren't the same.  Your dad deals with it differently, and while you may not like it, it doesn't sound like you were abused, neglected, or anything, just disappointed and depressed (which losing a parent young will do).  He doesn't have to change the speed or process of how he moves on for you, just ensure you're housed, fed, etc. and being cared for which is seems like he has.  Frankly you have no idea what's been going on in his head this whole time, so you really can't be judging him.\n\nYou were honest in how you feel, and that's a good thing.

She knew her time was coming and I was told about it by my parents. It was a pretty traumatic time and some memories stuck while others faded. But I will always remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing my mom ask my dad to take time after she died to move on. She said she knew I would need that and he needed to be there for me and to put me first. She also admitted she was scared that he was going to forget about her because he wouldn't want to deal with his pain. She said she didn't want to be forgotten or replaced. I don't even remember if my dad said anything. But I knew my mom was crying while she was talking and I was crying too. She wasn't wrong. I had already started falling apart when I knew she wouldn't be there anymore.\n\nMy dad dated almost as soon as my mom was in the ground and 6 months later he introduced me to the woman who would be his second wife. There was no support for me during that time. He focused on doing everything mom feared he would. His second wife from the get go was like \"I'm going to marry your dad and I'll be his wife and your new mom\". The next few years were awful and I hated my dad for moving on so fast, too fast for me, and for doing his best to make mom the past and replace her with his second wife.\n\nIt was only 2 years ago when things got better. My grandparents intervened on my behalf after being ignored for years. It helped so much to have them step up and do what needed to be done for me. I was lost. Barely making it through school and my friendships were almost non-existent because I was so depressed. I actually ended up diagnosed with depression.\n\nMy dad's wife thought that would be when I would start coming around to her and letting her in. But I still have no interest in a second mom or pretending she's anything more than some woman my dad is married to. He doesn't really care either but he'll do whatever she wants so we all started therapy together a year ago and after four months the therapist wanted her to leave and for it to be just dad and me. It really hasn't been going anywhere. But then last week his wife was determined to join us again and the therapist was like, you know what, speak up (to me) and say everything you have said in our 1:1 sessions. So I did. I told my dad he failed me by moving on too fast. I said he betrayed mom by making sure her biggest fear came through and by not doing the right thing by me, the child she gave him, his only child. I said he was hardly a dad to me since mom got sick. I told him he hadn't realized I was depressed, he didn't seem to care either, and he pretty much spat on my mom's grave with his actions.\n\nThe therapist told him that he should care way more than he does and told his wife she unrealistic with her expectations and needed to let them go. It was afterward they both got mad and told me I had been cruel and not honest.\n\nI'm now at my grandparents house but they still text to say I'm wrong.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They\u2019re going to have to hear and internalize some uncomfortable truths. They need to accept that it would be a long process to regain your trust, and one that might be a lot of two steps forward, one step back.

If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.\" -- they should have acted better; the next best time to act better is today.", "> I don't think it's fair for your mom/his late wife to put that on him. People are allowed to grieve however they need to, and if that means he moves on quickly, then so be it.\n\nI'm sorry, but you know men move on more quickly than women. Women are more loyal and have more empathy in this way. It's a really depressing reality that makes marriage scary for tons of women out there. I know I'm not the only one who read this post and thought \"damn, I don't want to get married if my husband would end up doing this.\"\n\nIt's okay to wish that you had married someone who loved you deeply and didn't immediately replace you upon death. She clearly sensed that she was more attached to him than the reverse, or she wouldn't have been worried at all. She brought it up because she correctly pegged him as lacking empathy, and being eager to replace her.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm just going to call bs on this one. It's completely okay to not marry someone (and to feel desperate pain upon realizing you have) who will move on quickly after you die. Imo the bar is below ground if we are going to start telling women that they need to accept relationships where their literal death won't even have an impact on their husbands.\n\nIt's much healthier for women to date men who care about them deeply... instead of whatever this is. Men who will stick with them in sickness and actually properly grieve her instead of moving on at a lightning pace. After all, it's what most women give. :/\n\nI really don't care if this is unpopular. I'd rather die alone than marry someone that moves on 6 months later. I don't mind someone moving on eventually. But damn. If I'm not worth more than half a year of grief -- and more likely it was LESS than that, since he would have had to date around for a while before finding the woman that would be his second wife, and 6 months is when she showed up, not when she started dating -- what's the point?\n\nShe clearly was feeling unloved, to have that conversation. This stuff doesn't exist in a vacuum. If he were a perfect amazing loving partner, the conversation wouldn't have even come up. She was clearly feeling neglected and maybe feeling distance between them, something. She was correct, after all. She predicted it all correctly. She knew what was up, which means there were signs beforehand. Painful signs that she didn't deserve to have to deal with during her cancer diagnosis...", "Dude didn\u2019t just move on, he was basically dating no sooner than the woman was put in the ground and left his eight year old without any support. He didn\u2019t try to get her help, he didn\u2019t try to help her in her grief, and he still hasn\u2019t", "I'm not judging him for moving on, but he's certainly 100% the asshole for completely disregarding the needs of his traumatized 8 year old cause he was too busy going out on dates.", "> although I suspect your mother wasn't demanding from your father but venting.\n\nI think it's way more likely that he was showing lack of empathy or love towards her beforehand. She correctly pegged him as the type to move on quickly, which worried her. I don't think she pulled it out of thin air.\n\nGive the woman some credit. She damn near predicted the future. I doubt that was *venting* -- there were most likely signs. Signs that he wasn't very attached, didn't care much, and wasn't going to be affected all that much by her death.\n\nThat must have been an extremely painful and heart-wrenching realization for this woman to have, while she was dying. I wouldn't wish anyone to realize that their partner doesn't love them all that much on their deathbed. She is definitely NTA for noticing these signs ahead of time, and being afraid and worried about them. Poor woman was probably feeling like she wasted her life with this guy, who she knew was going to move on extremely quickly after she was gone. \n\nHe even brought in a new woman and supported her as his child's \"new mom.\" That is not a thoughtful man who deserves consideration, that's damn near a monster walking around posing as a person.\n\nI'm sorry, I just think it's really messed up to call a woman an asshole for correctly fearing that her husband was apathetic towards her and her child.\n\nAnd it's just wrong to call OP an asshole, for being a victim of two people putting unfair expectations on OP. Yes, you should shut out people whose love is toxic. \n\nOP is probably also worried that if something happened to them, their dad would immediately replace them with a new baby and forget all about them. And they would have good reason to fear that.\n\nIt's also extremely fucked up to say \"your mother would have wanted this\" about a dead woman you don't know. Man, the more I read your comment the worse and worse it gets. Cut that shit out. Don't tell OP what their mother would want. What we KNOW about their mother, is that their mother wanted her husband to have more empathy for his family than he did. And he failed at that.\n\nSo I really, really fucking doubt that OP's mother would have wanted OP to feel pressured, slightest, like their mother was irrelevant and being replaced, and like they should have a \"new mom\" forced upon them in the first place.", "Dads paying for therapy and the therapist sure didn't look after him lol.

I disagree that moving on is his \"choice alone\", he should have considered his child, it is definitely a lot to ask but it's what is required of you when you have children.

I don't like speaking ill of a dead/dying person who was obviously not in a good place, but I think the father was in his rights to ignore that and move on as he saw fit, at least as long as he kept the relationship separate from the one with his child until his child was actually ready. We don't even really know what the state of their marriage was and whether he was happy in it before she got ill; if he moved on so quickly that seems like a sign that he may have already been grieving the relationship in other ways, but who knows.\n\nI think overall I'd say NTA, but leaning a bit towards ESH. I think OP's feelings are completely valid and understandable, and I can't fault them for feeling this way when their father definitely rushed things too much (for them), and allowed his new wife to bulldoze in a way that was grossly inappropriate.

He had a right to explore his own life on his own terms to the extent that he didn't rope his child into it.

I think being insecure and asking for reassurance that they won't move on quickly is kind of normal.\n\nI just don't think she would have ever made that request if he was there for her, emotionally. Considering he is showing an extreme lack of emotional intelligence to his child, he was likely also cruel and thoughtless to his wife as well. It's not like people are known for treating their children like shit while treating their spouses amazingly.\n\nYou're right, I probably wouldn't care if I know I was loved. But if I was being mistreated and in a less than stellar relationship when I got sick... the realization that you've married the wrong person and that your husband doesn't truly love you is a really fucking harsh one to endure shortly before death.\n\nThere is also a gender gap here. If you're a guy, you don't *have* to worry as much. Women are more likely to be left during sickness and men are more likely to move on quickly after death.

(Not your fault if they can't use their ears or eyes or heart, and their brains are in the wrong gear.)\n2. You seem to be pulling (or have pulled) yourself out of your depression.\n3. You are turning your schoolwork around and setting yourself up to build a good future for yourself.\n\nYou do NOT have to figure out what you want to do in advance. I was a good student. I'll share my path with you. Had thought I'd like to be a fashion designer, then maybe a fashion illustrator. In high school I studied commercial art. Also happened to study French and Russian and thought I'd like to be a diplomat. In college I studied business (finance) and French. Thought I'd like to be an international lawyer, then an international banker. As it happened, the banking industry tanked just as I graduated. A friend mentioned consulting. I thought it might round out my background (mostly it dealt with programming large systems). That was my first job out of college. After two years, I went to grad school and studied management and public policy. Spent a decade or so consulting to government entities until I had kids. Then I moved into writing and editing; it was great to do from home while my kids were growing up. As you can tell, I didn't have that whole path figured out in advance. I studied what I had an interest in and thought I would like to do. I never stopped learning and adjusting my career to suit my needs. (and was pretty happy with my career).\n\nThese days, I know the schools do tend to push you to figure it all out. Think and get informed. Make the decision that you feel is right for you. You are already a person who takes the time to think. I think you will choose well and will be able to adjust as you need and see fit. Really good wishes to you.\n\nP.S. You've got a good resource in your counselor. Talk over this stuff with them, too. Good luck!", "Our society wants us to quickly decide on a path and tells us we would be punished if we change our mind. But you live your life by making mistakes and by making your own decisions. If you\u2019re still exploring, that\u2019s what it is. If you\u2019re unsure, anything you choose out of fear will crumble later in your life. You need a lot of time to discover who you are, know that it\u2019s ok that you don\u2019t know what you want yet.", "Oh honey, I went to college as a dance major and came our with a psychology degree.  I went on to become a client service rep/data analyst and just got my first Project Manager job a couple of years ago at the age of 50. \n\nDon't listen to anyone who says you have to have it all figured out at your age. Or at any age, really. Just live your best life.\n\nAlso, you are NTA, but your dad and stepmom suck rocks.", "Yeah I remember that pressure as well. But it's honestly all BS. You won't know for sure what you want till you're doing it and it clicks. It's totally fine to take a bunch of classes to see what works for you.", "You know, the best advice I heard about how to answer people who disrespect boundaries, especially about career - say you want to be an accountant. The next best option is consultant. Nobody knows what a consultant does (I have acquaintances who\u2019ve been consultants for years, making 6 figures and still find it hard to explain what they really do) and accounting is too boring to actually care about unless you\u2019re an accountant in which case you\u2019ll find the technicals mildly mind numbing enough for your functioning brain to barely comprehend what\u2019s going on. Get them off your backs and focus on only, and only yourself.", "My bad. Fixed", "WTF?  If I told your the Henderson's family therapist in western Washington state did indeed take sides, is that what you are looking for?\n\nI know for a fact that my mother shopped around for a sympathetic (to her ) therapist to serve as my therapist when I was a teenager.  It still didn't completely work, because he pressured her to tell me some basic facts about the divorce (including why my stepsister remembered us playing together well before the divorce).  She chickened out, so the shrink laid out for me what she had told him.\n\nDid those examples help you *in any way?*", "He went to a support group of people in a similar situation after his wife died and got married two years later. That's a happy ending that you're twisting into something else.", "Well that's pretty fucked up.", "I agree - moving on \"quickly\" by whoever's standards doesn't make him TA, never acknowledging that that sucked for OP makes him TA", "Yeah. That's really where the father and stepmom are the TAs. The way they treated OP was definitely not okay, and they should not have expected OP to ever warm to the stepmom to that extent. But I think OP is (understandably) a bit too hung up on their mother's wishes. As tragic as it is, I don't think the mother gets a say in how her husband grieves her death and on what timeline. And since OP was only 8 years old they can't possibly know what the actual state of their relationship was and whether either of them in fact wanted out well before that. I think OP's feelings that their father \"betrayed\" the mother, while completely understandable, are ultimately unfair. The father owed certain things to OP, but not the mom. Everyone grieves differently and if part of his process was putting himself back out there on that timeline, so be it as long it didn't hurt any other living person.", "How could we possibly know that?  Could it be he was so broken by it that he can't look at her without feeling pain and guilt because she reminds him of his wife?  Could it be that he brought someone in to help where he can't?  Or maybe he was and still is simply unable to process it and it's causing him pain and to miss things?  We have no idea, but he managed to keep a roof over her head, give her food and clothes, get her to school, etc. and while that may be the bare minimum, it's not abuse.  I don't think either of them is to blame for their grief, but when it comes down to it she doesn't get a say in his dating even if we all think it was too soon for comfort.", "So what you're saying is that he's not allowed to have grief?  He's not allowed to deal with it poorly too, to miss things, to be consumed by it?  I'm not saying he was perfect, far from it, but maybe this was the best he could do under the conditions?  I simply don't think ***either*** of them are to blame here for not handling grief \"perfectly\".", "What\u2019s the problem with him dating? Would you prefer if he became a shut in?", "I changed careers in my late 30s! Expecting people to decide when they\u2019re teenagers what they want to do until they\u2019re in their 60s is super unreasonable. People grow and change, and that\u2019s a good thing!", "No. I\u2019m looking for examples of the blanket statement made by the other poster. Need more help?  You seem angry- maybe  go back to therapy to work on your mommy issues.", "Getting married two years later means he dated extremely quickly. He didn't wait 2 years to date. It's only a happy ending if you view replacing women as quickly as possible as a happy, positive thing.\n\nHow is it also a happy ending when he tormented his child with someone who kept insisting they were their \"new mom\" either? This isn't two lovely people falling in love. This is two apathetic, soulless people getting married and trampling all over a woman's memory and her living child's feelings...", "I think you are correct on the OP\u2019s view on mom\u2019s wishes, understandable as it is from the child POV. Dad had the right to begin a relationship but marrying her so soon and attempting to force the relationship between SM and OP was where is and she are TA. I\u2019m going to edit my judgment for that reason. Thanks for your insights.", "Yet again you're being far too generous. Seems like his dying wife knew he would do this though..", "I laugh at an eight-year-old didn\u2019t handle this perfectly. He\u2019s the fucking adult, so no an eight-year-old up to whatever age she is now which I\u2019m assuming is probably in her teens wasn\u2019t required to handle this perfectly. Especially if she didn\u2019t have the help to handle it. The therapy is not to deal with the fact that he remarried the therapy is to deal with the fact that he never tried to help her and then remarried you guys are all just thinking oh, he remarried, and she hated that he remarried he remarried six months after her mother died and never tried to help her in that six months, and hasn\u2019t tried to help her at all since then, the marriage isn\u2019t aside from that if he had never married and still never tried to help her or handle her grief, it would still be the same problem he actively try to replace her mother he\u2019s made sure that there are no traces of her mother", "If he was dating and taking care of the emotional needs of his daughter, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem and no one is saying he shouldn\u2019t date. You probably shouldn\u2019t date the same week you bury your wife and hope that your daughter is going to be OK with it. But the man is displaying profound since a selfishness, his needs above his daughters his needs above everyone. He probably didn\u2019t even let himself grieve if he cared about his late wife at all and it doesn\u2019t sound like he did.", "I didn\u2019t change career, but I kind of agree with you, the problem is \u201cwasting time\u201d, almost everybody I know thinks that finishing school late is precisely that (not me, I think you need to be ready to make big changes in life), I think sometimes you\u2019re not mature enough or have other issues (like op in this case), is fine to back down and reassess what you want and the path you\u2019re following", "I agree. I have had so many jobs/careers and have learned so much from each of them. You don't always have to have a big career, as long as you make a comfortable living and a happy life.\n\nBTW, so many people I know are working in a different career than their degree. Going to higher learning shows that you have aptitude and discipline, so don't sweat it and use the time to learn about yourself.", "[Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oih31/aita_for_saying_my_dad_failed_me_by_moving_too/k1kqisz/)", "[Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oih31/aita_for_saying_my_dad_failed_me_by_moving_too/k1kqisz/)", "[Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oih31/aita_for_saying_my_dad_failed_me_by_moving_too/k1l7mbb/)", "[Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oih31/aita_for_saying_my_dad_failed_me_by_moving_too/k1lj408/)", "Why would it be any of your business whether it took 2 years or 10 years? Daughter is an adult in her 20s and needs to recognize it's not her romantic life that was destroyed. The only apathetic soulless people in this story are those who think he needs to grieve indefinitely.", "Perhaps because she knew it would break him?  I'm not saying he deserves a Father of the Year award or anything, but the undiluted hatred he seems to be getting is out of line.  Sure it sounds like the failed in multiple ways, but it doesn't seem as though any of it was malicious or meant to be an AH, just that he failed.  He could have abandoned her, put her up for adoption/foster care, etc. but he at least stuck around and got the minimum done.  I don't think he deserves an AH rating for that.", "You're missing the point.  If this is legitimately the only way he could deal with it, which seems to be the case, how is he being an AH?  You can't take care of someone else if you're not taking care of yourself.  Him being too broken by it and not being able to give her everything she wanted or even needed from it is a failing, but not an AH move.  I'm not saying he did a good job, but it sure could have been worse.  The fact he managed the basics in such a situation is an achievement, if only a participation trophy variety.", "What needs does she have exactly? She didn\u2019t say anything but that he has a new wife & she doesn\u2019t like it. Her only stated problem is that she doesn\u2019t like that he has a wife. It\u2019s years later & she is still upset that he has a new wife. \n\nWhy should he care about if he daughter would be ok if he dated? She clearly would prefer for him to stay single till death based off the fact that it\u2019s been YEARS & she\u2019s still behaving as if it\u2019s lifelong trauma.", "I zapped them - thanks for digging them out.", "He doesn't deserve hatred, maybe he thought a new wife would be best for his daughter as well as himself but he's obviously palmed off all care of OP onto his new wife and is completely disinterested in his child. Deliberate neglect or abuse would have been too much effort for him. \n\nI'm just disappointed in the man. A last request was completely disregarded for his own comfort.", "So once he found a new wife and remember it was within 6 mos of the old one dying and his needs were being met why did he STILL NOT GET HER HELP? Its been years and he hasn\u2019t helped her at all", "Again, she probably would\u2019ve cared less about him having a new wife if he actually had cared that she was struggling and in grief and maybe had gotten her help. they didn\u2019t start doing therapy until now. The girl has been diagnosed with a major depression. Someone else had to step in and help her out. Her grandparents had to take custody of her because he\u2019s been neglecting her since her mother died, and according to her since before her mother died. she wants him to give a shit about her which obviously doesn\u2019t and again anyone who starts dating within a week or a month of their kids mother dying and doesn\u2019t seek to help that child through that process is an asshole. Sounds like you are one too.", "If your kids mother dies and you DON'T take them into consideration as you start dating days after she's buried, you're one of the worst excuses of a \"parent\" that I've ever read about. Good god why even have a kid if you are going to treat them like that.", "Clearly this man, as with most men, just should not have reproduced .  He does not possess the needed emotions to raise children.  I don't think he feels at all at least not with his heart.", "No problem, it doesn't take very long to go 'That doesn't make sense' and Ctrl+F the comment", "Finding a new wife doesn't remotely mean all his needs are met, or that he's done grieving.  People are complex, maybe he got some of his needs met, but that doesn't mean he's OK either.  The only things we know are that he managed the minimum but not much more, and that in some ways failed, but we don't know that he ever acted with malice or ill intent towards OP.", "The therapy is centered around her father having a new wife. Do you think she would be in therapy if he remained single. \n\nWhat exactly is he, a therapist, or anybody else supposed to do for her? Her mother is dead. At this point her flesh has rotted & she id now just bones in a wooden box under the ground. It sucks. But it\u2019s the truth. NOBODY,  can help her but herself. She can go to a million therapy sessions & her mother will never draw another breathe. She can pray to anybody 3x a day & her mother will still never draw another breathe. \n\nTHERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO FOR HER.", "Treat them like what? What did he treat her like. She hasn\u2019t said anything about his behavior other than the fact that he remarried. What did he do to her?", "Isn\u2019t this entire thing about the OP having a problem with him feeling with his heart? Are men only allowed to feel what you deem they should?", "Absolutely true. It's lovely when someone says it's a bot, though, and I know in advance I don't have to work too hard to confirm it. xD\n\nEdit: I mean, the ones where you go \"That doesn't make sense\" and have to dig into the comment history can be time-consuming.", "What\u2019s the saying..,the road to hell. it doesn\u2019t matter what his intent was, the result is a badly neglected depressed child. He\u2019s an AH no matter what you say to try to excuse and justify neglect, neglect is neglect. If he was going to do the bare minimum he shouldn\u2019t have bothered and sent her to people who could love and protect her", "Are you capable of genuine emotion?  Like are you even capable of caring for another living thing?", "I think it all starts with what you said. He didn't take her into consideration as he started dating minutes after her mom died, he then tried to push some random stranger into her life and had the balls to expect her to be welcomed as a \"new mother\", he ignored the consequences of his selfish actions even as his childs grades crumbled and she slipped into severe depression, all the way until her own grandparents had to step in since dad had his head too far uo his new wife's ass to take care of his daughter."]}
