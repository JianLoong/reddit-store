She knew her time was coming and I was told about it by my parents. It was a pretty traumatic time and some memories stuck while others faded. But I will always remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing my mom ask my dad to take time after she died to move on. She said she knew I would need that and he needed to be there for me and to put me first. She also admitted she was scared that he was going to forget about her because he wouldn't want to deal with his pain. She said she didn't want to be forgotten or replaced. I don't even remember if my dad said anything. But I knew my mom was crying while she was talking and I was crying too. She wasn't wrong. I had already started falling apart when I knew she wouldn't be there anymore.\n\nMy dad dated almost as soon as my mom was in the ground and 6 months later he introduced me to the woman who would be his second wife. There was no support for me during that time. He focused on doing everything mom feared he would. His second wife from the get go was like \"I'm going to marry your dad and I'll be his wife and your new mom\". The next few years were awful and I hated my dad for moving on so fast, too fast for me, and for doing his best to make mom the past and replace her with his second wife.\n\nIt was only 2 years ago when things got better. My grandparents intervened on my behalf after being ignored for years. It helped so much to have them step up and do what needed to be done for me. I was lost. Barely making it through school and my friendships were almost non-existent because I was so depressed. I actually ended up diagnosed with depression.\n\nMy dad's wife thought that would be when I would start coming around to her and letting her in. But I still have no interest in a second mom or pretending she's anything more than some woman my dad is married to. He doesn't really care either but he'll do whatever she wants so we all started therapy together a year ago and after four months the therapist wanted her to leave and for it to be just dad and me. It really hasn't been going anywhere. But then last week his wife was determined to join us again and the therapist was like, you know what, speak up (to me) and say everything you have said in our 1:1 sessions. So I did. I told my dad he failed me by moving on too fast. I said he betrayed mom by making sure her biggest fear came through and by not doing the right thing by me, the child she gave him, his only child. I said he was hardly a dad to me since mom got sick. I told him he hadn't realized I was depressed, he didn't seem to care either, and he pretty much spat on my mom's grave with his actions.\n\nThe therapist told him that he should care way more than he does and told his wife she unrealistic with her expectations and needed to let them go. It was afterward they both got mad and told me I had been cruel and not honest.\n\nI'm now at my grandparents house but they still text to say I'm wrong.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1695309179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oih31/aita_for_saying_my_dad_failed_me_by_moving_too/", "score": 707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stories like this make me sad. I know marriage is til death do us part, but to see some people move on quicker following the death of a spouse than I do after a relationship puts into question how much love they truly had for their partner.

The erasure of their existence in a matter of a year or even less is truly heartbreaking.", "NTA,\n\nFirst off, I want to say no matter what, you cannot be in the wrong. Your father is an ADULT, you are his child. No matter what you do or did as a child, those actions reflect on HIM as a parent. \n\nInstead of letting you process your feelings, he let you down because he could not process his own. He should have been the example for you to be able to process, move on, and honor the life your mother had. \n\nYour step mother also should not have tried to take the place of your mother so soon, or even at all. That is your choice to make, and her spot to EARN if you feel she is fit for that position. Your mother cannot be replaced, and her trying to do that to you especially as a small child was just unfair. Your father thought that since he filled the woman shaped hole in his life, he could force you to do the same. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that he ignored you for so long,  it is not your fault and never will be. It is cowardice to say the least that he could not gain the strength to be there for himself let alone his child. He had a responsibility to make sure you were not alone. \n\nGood on you for taking your time to process like your mother wanted, she knew what was best for you.

People are allowed to grieve however they need to, and if that means he moves on quickly, then so be it. His obligation is until death, and he's fulfilled that. There's also a possibility he had been grieving for some time even though his late wife was still alive. When your the primary care giver, you see the decline in health firsthand, and you can kinda accept the inevitable and start grieving, even before they're actually passed. So you need to accept that your dad is/has grieved in his own way and he is allowed to be happy with someone else. \n\nThat being said though, he did fail you as a parent. You were old enough to decide what kind of relationship you wanted with your step mom, and he didn't come to bat for you when she trampled your boundaries. He didn't consider at all how you were grieving or even your well being. It sounds like he is only considering what his current wife wants, and she wants to play happy family. They probably wanted to do family therapy with the expectation that it would get you to acquiesce to her wishes, but now it's backfiring on them, and now they're pissed.", "NTA because the fact of the matter is your father neglected to do right by you.\n\n\nhowever, I think it's unrealistic to expect another person to refrain from \"moving on too soon.\"\n\nyou don't know what's going on in his head\n\n\nyou don't know what's going on with his heart\n\n\nif companionship is what helps him then he shouldn't feel like he's doing anything wrong for that, nor should others put the expectation on him to refrain.\n\n\nwhile that doesn't give him a free pass to fail to support you, I don't see how he can't, on principle, do one *or* the other", "NTA. \n\nWhen it comes to being upset about how your mom would feel, you need to let it go.

That woman pushed her being a replacement for your mom on you, and your dad didn\u2019t step in or do anything. Your father did fail you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that he didn\u2019t consider your feelings. You deserved time and space to grieve instead of being bombarded with the idea of a replacement. \n\nYour father could have found happiness with someone else without pushing that happiness onto a young kid who just lost their mother. He didn\u2019t have to move that fast, and he should have at least *thought* about how it would impact you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you at all if you distanced yourself from him and eventually went low contact or no contact.

How long would have been sufficient in your eyes?\n\nI always find it disturbing when people try to judge what is an appropriate length of time before someone moves on with a new partner.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, let me shine a different light on your dad's emotions/behaviour. I don't think your dad intended to spit on your mum's grave directly, that was never his intention to make her a figure of the past - your dad freaked out the moment the reality hit he was losing his wife, he shut down, and probably has a lot of internal pain, anxiety, depression and grief to this day over your mum.\n\nHe did the \"man thing\" that your mum warned him not to do which is, he got up and carried on whilst ignoring his pain, grief, and all the emotions that came with losing his wife, the love of his life, and the mother of his child. Instead of going to therapy and allowing himself to heal his wounds, heartache, and pain, he shut himself off from his emotions and very much kept himself in the headspace of, \"got to keep going.\" Almost like being on a hamster wheel, and knowing that the moment you slow down, you'll get tripped up and floor it. Perhaps this is what your father has been doing? Keeping on going so that he never slows down enough for the momentum of emotions that are just crashing all up inside of him to actually catch up with him. It even sounds like your SM could just be a distraction, but obviously I don't know shit. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that if you heard your mum warn your father to not do what he's doing, I think she would only say it not because your father is heartless but because she knows that your father is emotionally detached from himself and his emotions. Which, if you have ever dealt with a man as such, trust me you know how their detached emotional sides can be their biggest weakness, hindrance etc. Wouldn't be surprised if your mum was probably your dad's biggest crutch and support emotionally and all.\n\nNow, this is all speculation because I don't know your father, but if it does resonate I hope it just shines a light on your father's behaviour after your mum passed. Like I said, I don't want to assume he's not being an asshole because he is, but grief is performed in different ways and avoidance is one. I also don't want you to feel like a throwaway child, when it could just be because your dad is an emotional avoidant dweeb lol.\n\nBut yeah, for now, stay with your Grandparents and work on yourself.  Otherwise, well done for your healing journey, well done for being outspoken about your emotions and I wish you all the best in life.\n\nEdit: grammar and that", "NAH.\n\nYou've got how you feel and how you grieve, but people aren't the same.  Your dad deals with it differently, and while you may not like it, it doesn't sound like you were abused, neglected, or anything, just disappointed and depressed (which losing a parent young will do).  He doesn't have to change the speed or process of how he moves on for you, just ensure you're housed, fed, etc. and being cared for which is seems like he has.  Frankly you have no idea what's been going on in his head this whole time, so you really can't be judging him.\n\nYou were honest in how you feel, and that's a good thing.

She knew her time was coming and I was told about it by my parents. It was a pretty traumatic time and some memories stuck while others faded. But I will always remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing my mom ask my dad to take time after she died to move on. She said she knew I would need that and he needed to be there for me and to put me first. She also admitted she was scared that he was going to forget about her because he wouldn't want to deal with his pain. She said she didn't want to be forgotten or replaced. I don't even remember if my dad said anything. But I knew my mom was crying while she was talking and I was crying too. She wasn't wrong. I had already started falling apart when I knew she wouldn't be there anymore.\n\nMy dad dated almost as soon as my mom was in the ground and 6 months later he introduced me to the woman who would be his second wife. There was no support for me during that time. He focused on doing everything mom feared he would. His second wife from the get go was like \"I'm going to marry your dad and I'll be his wife and your new mom\". The next few years were awful and I hated my dad for moving on so fast, too fast for me, and for doing his best to make mom the past and replace her with his second wife.\n\nIt was only 2 years ago when things got better. My grandparents intervened on my behalf after being ignored for years. It helped so much to have them step up and do what needed to be done for me. I was lost. Barely making it through school and my friendships were almost non-existent because I was so depressed. I actually ended up diagnosed with depression.\n\nMy dad's wife thought that would be when I would start coming around to her and letting her in. But I still have no interest in a second mom or pretending she's anything more than some woman my dad is married to. He doesn't really care either but he'll do whatever she wants so we all started therapy together a year ago and after four months the therapist wanted her to leave and for it to be just dad and me. It really hasn't been going anywhere. But then last week his wife was determined to join us again and the therapist was like, you know what, speak up (to me) and say everything you have said in our 1:1 sessions. So I did. I told my dad he failed me by moving on too fast. I said he betrayed mom by making sure her biggest fear came through and by not doing the right thing by me, the child she gave him, his only child. I said he was hardly a dad to me since mom got sick. I told him he hadn't realized I was depressed, he didn't seem to care either, and he pretty much spat on my mom's grave with his actions.\n\nThe therapist told him that he should care way more than he does and told his wife she unrealistic with her expectations and needed to let them go. It was afterward they both got mad and told me I had been cruel and not honest.\n\nI'm now at my grandparents house but they still text to say I'm wrong.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now if they want to have a relationship with you, especially one where you see his wife as even a step mom, they\u2019re going to have to do it the hard way. They\u2019re going to have to hear and internalize some uncomfortable truths. They need to accept that it would be a long process to regain your trust, and one that might be a lot of two steps forward, one step back.

Eventually you\u2019ll get somewhere.  These people mean well but they aren\u2019t helping.  Just keep sculpting.", "I'm turning 40 this year and I still don't know what I want to do. Just do your best, enjoy life as much as you can, be good to people, and you'll be ok. Life has ups and downs and you're allowed to change your mind later. And I'm saying this as someone who has plenty of regrets and is at a particularly low spot right now, but I know it will get better too, and I appreciate that my life has made me the awesome person I am today (even if sometimes I'm broken and lost, I'm still pretty awesome).", "You're definitely not alone in that. And sometimes what you think will be the right fit *isn't*. I went into college expecting to major in one subject (English/Lit) and fell in love with another subject entirely (Poli Sci) during my freshman year. Some people don't declare until after that, too, and that's normal, too!", "Not only are you not alone here, in fact, most people don't know at your age. My kid will be in college next fall and has no idea where she wants to end up. I started the career I now love when I was 25 or so.", "It's ok to not know what you want to do. I always felt like its just cultural thing for people who work in education to believe that you HAVE to go to college. I think also colleges have benefitted immensely by encouraging people to go who don't really know what they want just so the school can get paid. If you aren't sure what you want to do with your life then you don't have to go to college yet. Just start looking for things/jobs that interest you and give them a try with the idea you can leave if you don't enjoy them! Bonus points if you stick it out to line up another job before you leave that one.", "I thought I knew what I wanted, studied it all the way through college, applied to graduate school and didn\u2019t get in. Had to find a new dream and it was definitely a better path for me. Don\u2019t worry if you are undecided.", "Take your time with this! If you're in high school see if you can do some dual enrollment with a local community college. Just take a couple of fun classes in something that might interest you. It's a low risk way to see if higher education is something you want. You have plenty of time to figure it out! The most important piece is just making sure that you feel love and safety from your grandparents and that you are working on moving forward.", "NTA. buddy I'm 34 and I still don't know what I want to do. It doesn't mean I haven't had a good life or career though. Don't worry, you'll be alright mate.", " I understand your dad probably saw your mom gone before she passed away.", "I never knew what I wanted. I fell into something I was good at, but I still  haven't figured it out and I'm 40.", " You were a young child who needed to be put first by your remaining parent.", "Your father did fail you. He continues to fail you. I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. You deserve better.", "\nI ended up dropping out of college due to illness.", " I want to do. Just do your best, enjoy life as much as you can, be good to people, and you'll be ok.", "I\u2019m so sorry for all your trauma. They\u2019re in denial. They\u2019re too up in their own world, they never considered you and your feelings.", "They\u2019re in denial. They\u2019re too up in their own world, they never considered you and your feelings."]}
