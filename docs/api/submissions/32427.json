No HOA, no sidewalks, etc. We keep to ourselves in our space and we both travel for work. \n\n\r  \nA year ago, our acquaintance neighbor started dating somebody new and moved them into their home. None of our business.\n\n\r  \nWe were polite, yet kept them at a distance. As they started engaging with us more, we offered them a beverage one evening. The men were outside chatting and I went inside to make the drinks. \"I just drink for the way it makes me feel, I don't care what it tastes like\" the neighbor's new partner (NP) mentioned... NP then followed me inside my embarrassingly messy home so I was already a little on edge. We picked our elixir of choice and NP mentions \"I love seeing other peoples homes\" (yellow flag 1) before her bracelet fell off her wrist and she picked it up quickly saying \"Its mine! it's mine! I promise I'm not stealin'\". I knew the bracelet wasn't mine... so now red flag. I hurried us back outside and thought that was the end of it.\n\n\r  \nFF to NP walking over to our property, knocking on the side door in the middle of my workday (I WFH), and asking if she can come in. I request that she uses the front door and meet her there. She steps in the house and starts walking around the living room. I ask what she needs and she again says she loves to see other people's stuff \"but I'm not casing the place\" (red flag 2) before asking for more alcohol. I hand her a half empty/old bottle of liquor from our bar cart and she goes home.\n\n\r  \nRecently we're trying to stay away from her. Conversation has been weird and uncomfortable. Even our friends are uncomfortable around her. She's wandered up onto our front porch and rang the doorbell and then walked off (carrying a flashlight in the middle of the day). And when asked what she needed (we have a camera doorbell) she asked for one of the items off our front porch. We NP borrow it and she has not returned it. She mentioned a few weeks ago that she had a cough/cold that wouldn't go away and the only thing that could fix it is Vodka. H suggested tea, honey and moonshine and offered that to her. She accepted along with some throat coat tea, and went back home.\n\n\r  \nWe don't know the situation next door, NP's boyfriend travels for work (early morning to late evening) and she is there at the house alone. They had 2 vehicles and every excuse for why she can't/won't drive. NP has now asked us multiple times if we're going out, to let her know and buy her alcohol. We believe they are in their late 40s early 50s and have since responded that we are not comfortable purchasing alcohol for her. Today's communication asked what time \"Husband's Bar\" opens....
