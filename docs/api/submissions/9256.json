And just because you VIEW Alexis as a co-worker, to your wife that sounds like you're interested in Alexis. And since your friend is with you at work and your wife isn't, she really has no clue as to how YOU and Alexis interact with each other.\nAnd according to your coworker, you guys have something going on.\n\nNow you're playing it off as not important, When really you're pissing off your wife and at the same time emotionally hurting her feelings, invalidating her feelings as if they're ridiculous, and essentially telling her- she doesn't matter to you.
