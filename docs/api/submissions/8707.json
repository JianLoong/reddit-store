I tried calling the realtor multiple times as well as emailing them but nothing ever happened over it. I take that back. They evicted the girl not on the lease next door because they never reported she lived there. If they had reported her, nothing would have changed in terms of price. Her name would have just been required to be put on the lease. Which is something written into the lease that they bold and highlight and make certain that you understand so I had no way of knowing they hadn\u2019t reported her being there.
