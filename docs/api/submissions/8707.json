It sounds like this person has double-parked more than once before you actually approached management with the issue. You were not responsible for HOW management decided to remedy the issue. That was out of your hands.   \n\n\nAlso, if people don't like it, then maybe they shouldn't park like turds. haha. Then they won't get towed. Problem solved. There's no other reason for them to be upset: if they parked normal, there would be no reason for them to worry about getting towed. Their actions, their problem. Not yours.", "NTA...Everyone knows double parking is wrong. You have every right to say something. Those who follow the rules need not worry about being towed.", "NTA\n\nIt is hard to not be outraged at jerks who think that their fancy car is so special that they need to protect it by taking multiple spaces.\n\nLet the guy take two spaces far away from the building.  Otherwise, have him towed with pleasure.", "NTA. I think you found your double parker. Don't take two spaces, don't get towed.", "NTA, double parkers should have a special double space in hell.", "NTA double parkers and other parking abusers are a fucking nightmare.

You're not the hero they want, you're the hero they need.", "NTA\n\nBut that\u2019s not what double parking is. Actual [double parking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_parking) is much worse than parking in 2 spaces.", "NTA. I'm not sure why you're surprised that reporting parking violations meant they might actually start enforcing those rules, but you reported a violation and they are doing what they have to do to enforce the rules and make sure it doesn't happen again. You did nothing wrong--just follow the rules and don't get towed yourself!", "NTA.\n\nYou did your part in telling the property management and it's not your responsibility how they choose to handle the situation. I feel that the only people that have to worry or would be upset about the situation are those that violate basic parking principles. Double parking is the worst for everyone but the double parker.", "NTA and only a major AH would take up two spaces for their car.  Only the guilty entitled people will complain.  Don't worry about it", "\" was I valid to complain?\"\n\nNTA\n\nThey were parking rudely and taking up too much space.  This is becoming a common thing.

The reason is probably the same, they're parking more than their share of cars in the lot.  Ignore them, you pay to have a set amount of space for your car in the lot.  Problem solved better than you expected.  Hopefully this frees up more than 1 space from the AHs complaining.", "NTA they should park properly. It is nobody's fault but their own if they get towed.", "NTA. This person is *intentionally* taking up 2 spaces so no one accidently scrapes or scuffs their precious lexus. Would've done the same. Im sure you pay to park, why should you have to walk to a separate floor so this person car doesn't get **potentially** scratched.", "Just park really close to the driver side door so it's impossible to open. You can atleast inconvenience him alot", "NTA.\n\nIt isn't hard to park in one space. Sorry, the picture posted on Reddit itselt got cut off \ud83d\ude05. Yeah, no if this is a common occurence from this person then you were in the right to report.\n\nThis person is being selfish and inconsiderate. Honestly, anyone who double parks (intentionally of course) are inconsiderate", "NTA-it was not a big fuss.  Chances are good that the person that is calling it a big fuss, is the person that is parked like a jerk!", "I'd bet money that whoever posted that comment on the group's FB page was the double-parker, AND that they reworded what MGMT actually said. \n\n\"Making a big fuss\" shows they are trying to make double-parking complaints sound petty, whereas double-parking in actuality shows the perpetrators have no regard for other resident.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally, if someone (like this person) is incapable of parking in a single spot, then they're not capable of being a licensed driver, either.", "You are NTA. Sucks that towing is enforced, visitors are probably more of a hassle now but it isn\u2019t your fault, mister double-parker is the kid in class that ruins it for the bunch", "I... don't get why people are kicking off. Just don't double park if you don't want to get towed. Seems pretty open and shut.", "NTA Double parking is rude and the person doing it only cares about themself. This should definitely be reported. Almost as bad as parking in a handicap spot without being handicap. I hope they get towed eventually and learn a lesson from it.", "Double parkers: Arrogant, entitled, antisocial members of society. Not sure it's worth the gas pollution to tote that big ego around.", "Exactly management would have everyone\u2019s car info on record so they could keep track on what cars are supposed to be parked their. My money says they contacted the resident warning him not to double park and is now complaining he can\u2019t take two spots.", "yep we do, it's a gated parking garage in the city.", "I can imagine the Lexus guy calling MGMT about that and making a fuss.", "Are you serious?  It's clearly parked over the space line.  Basically runs down the middle of the car.", "yeah, they're clearly way over the line. I imagine it's tight spaces but that's life.", "I thought so. Doesn't change my jugement since you were already NTA in my eyes but the fact that you pay for a service and can't use it because of TA makes you even more legit. Those kinds of parking spots aren't cheap...", "I goofed.

Where I am double parking means stopping in a discs you shouldn\u2019t be for a short term, often with someone sitting in the car, not taking up two parking spaces.  Is it possible there is a misunderstanding with some of the residents?", "and don't forget to use a black sharpie to add that missing letter \"s\" at the end of the state name", "NTA - they shouldn't get 2 spots, it's crazy how entitled some people are", "Nta. There will be no problem if people park correctly.", "BAHAHAHAHAHAHA. \nNTA. \nI may have once had a very small car, and a very egotistical colleague who would double park his lower end sports car in a very full parking garage. I started pulling in the half space next to him every night have  day.  He may have ended up moving floor by floor, and I may have followed his double parking self right along.  It took 2 weeks,but he never double parked after that.", "NTA. Anyone who\u2019s complaining would be keying cars if they had to deal with this shit.", "NTA, and the others wouldn't be so up in arms if they were following the rules. The threat of towing is upsetting only if you are in violating the rules yourself.", "NTA someone does this at my work regularly and it drives me up the fucking wall. Just park your shitty car properly.", "NTA. There is literally no reason to be concerned over towing being enforced in a parking lot unless you're parking like an asshole.\n\nAll the people complaining are also more than likely assholes and are angry because they may have consequences for parking like one.", "OP I'm in this exact situation. I got a ticket for parking illegally on the street because the only spot that was available was actually taken up by a car double parking. My only other option is to park illegally in the fire lane and stay awake until people start to leave for work  IT SUCKS . Call them out! NTA", "NTA\n\nBut what did you think was going to happen? They were just going to send a nice little love letter to the Lexus owner asking them to please stop doing it? The Lexus owner knows what they are doing is wrong, and now if they continue, they will pay the price, literally! Anyone else who is upset about it, must be concerned that they are violating the rules also. Those who do not violate the rules have nothing to worry about!", "Not only are you NTA, but you're the hero for taking the initiative to address an uncomfortable situation.  Huzzah for your bravery!", "NTA and the person who posted is probably the person who drives the Lexus, probably had a go at the property manager when they told them if they did it again they\u2019d get towed and the property manager probably just made up that people were making a fuss to try to deflect the wrath of the Lexus owner away from them as they\u2019re just over the drama.", "I usually don\u2019t condone this behavior, but it\u2019s a brand new Lexus IS and they sure are not cheap.", "Yes, this person is a greedy parker.", "I like RIF Is Fun more than the official app, FWIW."]}
