{"id": 14875, "submission_id": "12mzh2u", "title": "AITA for being annoyed that my gf decided to clean her house when I was over?", "selftext": "I (22F) have been dating my gf (21F) for over a year now. We're both uni students who live roughly 30-50 minutes away from each other, depending on the traffic. When we first started dating, we'd see each other several times a week. These days, we see each other only a few days a month due to travel time, her working on top of uni, and me suffering from long covid. So, when we do get a chance to see each other we usually like to focus on us time.\n\nYesterday, I drove to my gf's house to see her for the first time in about 2 weeks. I arrived in the late afternoon. I would have gone over sooner as she was home all day, but I had my own things to get done before I could head over. \n\nWe'd decided that we'd chill in bed and watch some movies we've been planning on watching for a while. However, when I went and sat in bed, she started busying herself with vacuuming her floors, organising laundry, just basic household chores. I offered to help her with the cleaning so she'd be done sooner, but she declined and said she would be done very soon. So I got comfy and waited, despite feeling a bit upset that it seemed she didn't value our time together. I knew she had been home all day so I didn't quite get why she couldn't have done it earlier so we could spend that time together.\n\nFast forward to an hour later, she was finally finished with cleaning and came to join me in bed. By this time it was kinda late and we didn't have enough time to watch any movies before I was to head home. I was quite exhausted at that point (the long covid has really impacted my energy levels, and I'd used a lot of my energy that morning) so I wasn't up to expressing my feelings to her last night, and soon went home to rest. \n\nSo AITA for being annoyed that she cleaned when we were meant to be spending time together?\n\nEDIT: it seems that a lot of people are assuming I'm a man? We're both women, and we both have pretty low sex drives so we weren't planning on having sex.\n\nEDIT 2: some more info: we were planning this a week in advance and were both very excited. We both had the day off and early in our planning we'd briefly mentioned getting our chores and stuff done early in the day and spending the evening together, so I assumed she would have it done before I got there (which I see now I probably shouldn't have assumed).", "created_utc": 1681558746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mzh2u/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_gf_decided_to/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure if you're the A H but you're definitely immature.\n\nSooo idk", "NAH, Another thought could be that OP's girlfriend is comfortable with OP over allowing them to tackle the chordes they've been dreading. Motivation is low when you're burnt out, but for some people, having your SO there motivates and energizes you to do chores. Communicating feelings will help both parties on what happened last night.", "It was meant to be several hours and we were going to just see how many movies we got through before I got too exhausted.

I didn't have the energy to last night, and this morning I was unsure whether I was just overreacting or not.", "I also don't understand why OP couldn't just chill or chat with her while she did her chores.

If they were, I could understand saying \u201cSorry, I have to pop this laundry into the machine or I\u2019ll have nothing clean for tomorrow\u201d but to invite someone over and then ignore them for an hour is kinda jerky.

Also, we weren't planning on having sex.", "Thank you. I can see how hard it might be for some to understand what its like living with an illness that takes so much energy.", "But that still doesn\u2019t make the GF  T A. The GF still has things to do.

Did she realize you were only planning to stay for two hours? Could you have napped while she was cleaning?", "I mean if only waiting for an hour had you two exhausted to watch a movie you probably weren't going to finish the movie anyways so?", "One more info, what exactly was she doing before you came over that day?", "That\u2019s probably why she didn\u2019t accept your offer to help then. You berate her because you think helping her with her chores would be mean she was done sooner, but she would\u2019ve been aware that accepting your help would probably have exhausted you even faster. I mean, if you were too tired after lying in bed waiting for an hour how much energy would you have left after 30-45mins of of cleaning.", "Letting it fester is more draining than just expressing yourself, which you probably can see now in hindsight", "The timeline makes no sense either. They say the plan was to watch \u2018some\u2019 movies so minimum 3-4 hours if we assume 2 films, but 1 hour cleaning meant OP had to leave?", "But I feel like if you make plans with someone - anyone! - for them to come over to watch movies with you, it\u2019s weird and slightly jerky for you to then do something else solo for an hour once they arrive. Unless it\u2019s something like a work thing that pops up and you NEED to attend to it, in which case you\u2019d explain that and apologize. Is OP\u2019s gf the worst person ever? Certainly not. But yeah, that\u2019s mildly rude. NTA, OP.", "Maybe she hadn't done it early because she had other stuff to do? He said she's in school and she works.", "Why should she? It was only an hour. Why should she put off her workload for someone who could have come earlier but didn't want to put off his?", "This is the key point. An agreement was made.", "This is the problem right here...\"it was implied.\"    Communicate.  She isn't a mind reader. It doesn't sound like anything was actually said before or during her little cleaning spree. You aren't an AH, but if you just use your words, this is an easily avoidable problem.", "I quickly learned in relationships that implying, or assuming our partners should have the sense to know XYZ, is a major and preventable problem. 10+years in, I don't assume anything is implied anymore. In my early 20s I'd act \"visibly\" tired or upset and see how they respond, but no more. Spelling things out solves many issues.", "Why didn't you spend the night?", "OP is a she. Also who gives a shit?  She is not the center of the universe.  The girlfriend apparently had more to do that day than the OP.  She's JUST as entitled to handle her shit, as the OP.   Life is not a constant amusement park. It's chores, and illness and bad times too. If OP isn't equipped to handle that, OP shouldn't be in a relationship.", "Ok so with that information, NTA. I think something may still be up.  Eventually every relationship evolves into that comfort zone where you can fold laundry while hanging out and maybe she is oblivious but her effort this week seemed like someone avoiding spending time with you for the few hours you were there.  If you want this relationship to survive long distance, you both need to put more effort in than a few hours on a weekend (why not stay over the night before or the night after, hitting the road early to get to class?). There's an expression for married couples, if you're don't date your wife, someone else will.  You guys are at the dating stage and don't appear to be dating.", "Yes, I've lived with this for over a decade and I think even my close friends/partners don't fully understand what it's like and how limited my activities are. And how much I have to plan and then replan everything so carefully in order to pace and not crash. \n\nI feel like usually only other people with ME (or something similar, like long covid) really understand. \n\nThe people saying you should have brought it up immediately with her - in an ideal world that would be great, but I can very much see how that just might not have been a realistic option for you at the time. Emotional conversations can be *so very* exhausting, and if you needed to get home then you needed to reserve enough energy to do so safely.\n\nI see you've said that she's very understanding of how long covid affects you (which is great). Hopefully she'll be receptive to why you were upset, if you do want to bring it up.\n\nSolidarity \ud83d\udc95", "Oh no I walked into the trap of heteronormative assumption (enough to cloud my vision of the very clear tags you put there), and IM a gay man; well fuck I wish I could downvote myself, very sorry...", "it's a metaphor. you give off big dick energy in your post....", "makes even less sense after the edit. off you go", "I don't really know. She sent me a few Facebook reels in the morning so she'd been watching those for a bit but otherwise I'm not sure.", "Yeah, hindsight is pretty darn clear.", "*she said", "You guys are both filling in big missing chunks of info with assumptions, OP needs to fill us in on what gf was doing in the morning", "Because from the sounds of things, that was the plan they made together - to reserve that specific time for the two of them.\n\n\"Only an hour\" is a very different thing when you're chronically ill.", "Exactly right. It wasn't implied that you'd be there at a specific time, that was explicit. You came late because you had other things to do. Was it ever \"implied\" that missing time with her during the day, contrary to prior plans, would be ok?", "I dunno, if I\u2019m not the center of their universe and they mine, to the point where vacuuming is more fun than watching a movie with me, I\u2019d just dip out forever. Why bother dating someone who isn\u2019t excited to see me?", "Thank you for the insight, it's definitely something for me (and my gf) to think over.", "One thing I've found helpful for getting people to better understand energy-limiting chronic illness is the spoon theory.
