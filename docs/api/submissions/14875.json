We're both uni students who live roughly 30-50 minutes away from each other, depending on the traffic. When we first started dating, we'd see each other several times a week. These days, we see each other only a few days a month due to travel time, her working on top of uni, and me suffering from long covid. So, when we do get a chance to see each other we usually like to focus on us time.\n\nYesterday, I drove to my gf's house to see her for the first time in about 2 weeks. I arrived in the late afternoon. I would have gone over sooner as she was home all day, but I had my own things to get done before I could head over. \n\nWe'd decided that we'd chill in bed and watch some movies we've been planning on watching for a while. However, when I went and sat in bed, she started busying herself with vacuuming her floors, organising laundry, just basic household chores. I offered to help her with the cleaning so she'd be done sooner, but she declined and said she would be done very soon. So I got comfy and waited, despite feeling a bit upset that it seemed she didn't value our time together. I knew she had been home all day so I didn't quite get why she couldn't have done it earlier so we could spend that time together.\n\nFast forward to an hour later, she was finally finished with cleaning and came to join me in bed. By this time it was kinda late and we didn't have enough time to watch any movies before I was to head home. I was quite exhausted at that point (the long covid has really impacted my energy levels, and I'd used a lot of my energy that morning) so I wasn't up to expressing my feelings to her last night, and soon went home to rest. \n\nSo AITA for being annoyed that she cleaned when we were meant to be spending time together?\n\nEDIT: it seems that a lot of people are assuming I'm a man? We're both women, and we both have pretty low sex drives so we weren't planning on having sex.\n\nEDIT 2: some more info: we were planning this a week in advance and were both very excited. We both had the day off and early in our planning we'd briefly mentioned getting our chores and stuff done early in the day and spending the evening together, so I assumed she would have it done before I got there (which I see now I probably shouldn't have assumed).", "created_utc": 1681558746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mzh2u/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_gf_decided_to/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You berate her because you think helping her with her chores would be mean she was done sooner, but she would\u2019ve been aware that accepting your help would probably have exhausted you even faster.

Also who gives a shit?  She is not the center of the universe.  The girlfriend apparently had more to do that day than the OP.  She's JUST as entitled to handle her shit, as the OP.   Life is not a constant amusement park. It's chores, and illness and bad times too. If OP isn't equipped to handle that, OP shouldn't be in a relationship.", "Ok so with that information, NTA. I think something may still be up.  Eventually every relationship evolves into that comfort zone where you can fold laundry while hanging out and maybe she is oblivious but her effort this week seemed like someone avoiding spending time with you for the few hours you were there.  If you want this relationship to survive long distance, you both need to put more effort in than a few hours on a weekend (why not stay over the night before or the night after, hitting the road early to get to class?).

Emotional conversations can be *so very* exhausting, and if you needed to get home then you needed to reserve enough energy to do so safely.\n\nI see you've said that she's very understanding of how long covid affects you (which is great).

I did read your edits, and they just confirm that this whole visit was based on assumptions and implications that were never voiced. You said in a few comments that you and her intended to spend the whole day together, but then you came later in the afternoon. Did you inform her that you would be coming over later than originally discussed? You also said in comments that it was \"implied\" that BOTH of you were going to get things done earlier in the day. Again, was this actually ever voiced or discussed? I agree with others about the hypocrisy you are exhibiting, that it's ok to push back plans because YOU have things to do, but it's not okay when she does it. From what I can gather from the info present, it sounds like she didn't know when you were actually coming over and she either 1) waited the whole time, expecting you to arrive at any moment, and therefore didn't do any chores, or 2) she got other things done that were slightly more important than cleaning, still not knowing when you were coming. \nThere's also the issue of the timeline. She cleaned for an hour, and then it was time for you to go? Did you tell her how long you planned to stay? Did she know you were only intending to stay an hour? I feel if she knew that info, cleaning would not have been so pertinent to her and she would have postponed it, or at least cut it short. And what exactly were you planning on doing for just an hour? You said sex wasn't planned, and I wasn't referring to that. I'm just genuinely asking what you possibly had planned to do for a short hour? Why didn't you just stay over? Did she expect you to stay over? Maybe she thought she had more time with you, and that's why cleaning happened?\nThere's a lot of blanks that could easily be filled in by talking to her. And, after a year, you really should know this by now. You being so young is not an excuse. If the both of you want this to actually last and work out, you both need to do better and communicate.

This is the kind of bumps in the road you experience in relationships, and it's all about how you handle it. I understand why you were a bit hurt and frustrated that she spent an hour cleaning.

You think she has to drop everything to pay attention to you?", "You\u2019re definitely not in the wrong for your feelings. The cleaning could have waited, or they could have done it prior to your coming. Given the fact that time spent is limited, it seems there is something else going on with them, IMO.", "I think I need more info to decide\u2026 you are both students\u2026 how limited is her time? Does she work? How many hours does she need to study? Does she have adhd or ocd? Is it possible she was embarrassed by her place not being clean? Did you call to head over first?", ">I would have gone over sooner as she was home all day, but I had my own things to get done before I could head over.  \n>  \n>I knew she had been home all day so I didn't quite get why she couldn't have done it earlier so we could spend that time together.\n\nso your stuff is more important than her stuff, noted.\n\nYTA, other people have lives and stuff to do, not only you.", ">We'd decided that we'd chill in bed and watch some movies\n\n>Fast forward to an hour later, she was finally finished with cleaning and came to join me in bed. By this time it was kinda late and we didn't have enough time to watch any movies before I was to head home\n\n... The timeline makes no sense. You planned to chill in bed and watch \"some movies\", implying that you planned on watching more than just one movie. Even if you watched the shortest movies possible, that would still take at least 3 hours.\n\nSo why is it you had no time to watch any movies after your girlfriend spent an hour cleaning?\n\nDid you seriously drive to hang out with your girlfriend for like an hour? That seems pretty weird to me.\n\nUnless you have more info to clarify, ESH and it seems like you were both being kind of unnecessarily difficult.", "NAH\n\nDealing with long covid or something similar right now too, it sucks. And when you have very limited time to get out and do things all of it seems precious.\n\nHowever, sometimes I do enjoy just vibing in the same space as my partner. Sometimes that can be ok as well. She might have thought you would be there longer and that it was ok to do this first. Sometimes you plan to watch a movie but get the urge to clean or something first, it definitely happens. Also communicating with her at the time that you really wanted to start the movie might have been a good idea.", "I mean, you chose to do other things earlier in the day instead of visiting her earlier? And then she chose to do chores instead of spending time together. Sounds pretty similar to me so ESH.", "just\u2026..communicate with her???? YTA", "ADHD person here. I tend to get more done when my SO is around. When he works from home I try to be quiet and just do meals for him. Second he's off work my brain kicks into high gear.\n\nI used to ask my friends to come over when I was in college just to help me out by being around while I clean or study.\n\nIt's weird but my SO and I have worked through it. He keeps me company while he unwinds from work. Then we spend quality time together after I tidy up or finish chores.", "chronic fatigue is going to exist no matter what you\u2019re doing besides the fact that she also did a whole day of chores an errands before hand", "You were planning at least 3 hours of movie watching (at least 2 movies) but after waiting for 1 hour you therefore couldn't watch ANY movies as you were too tired from *checks notes* sitting in bed waiting...? Last I remember, watching movies isn't a physical endurance event. Also, you could have just stayed over.", "You were too tired to watch a movie but you were awake enough to drive for 30-50min?", "You don't know what other stuff she did with that time. Why didn't OP just stay over?", "OP should know by now that she has limited energy so doing her chores before visiting was her fault still.  I think she is the AH either way.", "Should have been ESH, thanks.", "I think it depends on how you process things. I like to be more sure of how I\u2019m feeling before bringing it up with people, and as a result I\u2019ll often say things a day or two after the fact once I\u2019ve processed my emotions. For whatever reason, it just takes me a longer period of time to do that.\n\nIt has actually worked really well in my relationships because I don\u2019t overreact or say something I don\u2019t mean in the moment, and can have calm clear discussions about what is actually bothering me. People I\u2019ve dated have found it amusing but overall have said they respect my carefulness. \n\nNot saying everyone should be like me though, just that different things work for different people.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m confused about too. And if OP had to leave earlier than expected because of low energy levels, well, maybe the gf had low energy levels earlier and couldn\u2019t get the chores done then. OP sounds whiny and selfish. YTA", "Exactly! It takes a special kind of AH to start doing some intensive hour-long weekly chore when their partner is coming over for the first time in god knows how long. \n\nEven if OP did not communicate their expectations well enough, that\u2019s still a big red flag. Why invite your partner to come over if you\u2019re not gonna spend time with them?", "So you got there, and an hour later it was too late to watch a movie because you had to leave? But you said you were planning to watch several movies, so that doesn't make sense. It sounds like she was probably angry because she expected you a lot earlier, since you were so looking forward to spending time together. Instead you were there less than three hours (one hour for her to clean and not enough time afterward for a two-hour movie). YTA", "An hour is not too long or short of a time. Frankly speaking, You can make idle conversation and enjoy each other\u2019s company while one of you is doing chores. You don't need to have 100% of your partner\u2019s undecided attention. \n\nShe claims she wanted to watch some movies with her partner. With movies being plural, the duration could be anywhere from two hours or more. That's ample time to cuddle and relax. \n\nSometimes things don't go accordingly, so you adjust and make do; instead of idling your time away while she finishes up her chores, go over and enjoy her company. You can do multiple things instead of watching movies as \u201cvalued\u201d time together. \n\nIf you're annoyed or frustrated, talk about it with your partner and come to an understanding. \n\nHowever, what you wrote made no sense. After an hour later of cleaning, it was too late to watch a movie together. Do you expect people to believe that? Additionally, if your energy levels were depleted, as you've said, why not express this to your partner, and take a quick nap to recharge and continue spending quality time together?\n\nYou were upset, so you went home. Let's not beat around the bush here. I don't believe for a second that an hour of waiting exhausted you to the point you needed to go home. If that was indeed true, then why drive up there? Why complain that you wanted to watch movies together? Why say it was already late after an hour of being there?", "In my own experience: my bf is tone deaf to me saying \"no, it isn't a good time to get together because I have too much I need to get done.\" Just throwing it out there that your gf maybe needed to spend her days off catching up on her life chores, but felt bad because she hadn't seen you in awhile, and didn't want to tell you to stay home. It doesn't mean she doesn't love you--- maybe she is spread thin lately.", "NTA. Idk how people are equating someone showing up late due to chores and someone actively doing chores with a guest over. Obviously it would have been better for you both if you arrived earlier, but to me it\u2019s bizarre that your gf would not leave the chores for another day (especially if you are both looking forward to seeing each other!).", "YTA. You spent up all your energy earlier in the day doing whatever chores you had and were tired by the time she was ready to chill (one hour?). Didn\u2019t sound like you were great company.", "NTA- if i invite someone over to hang out, i don't pick that time to start cleaning!", "It only took her an hour, and that left no time for movies? Most movies are over an hour let alone watching multiple. Sounds like you didn\u2019t have much time for your plans anyways.", "yta. chronically ill and caretaker to my roommate who is chronically ill as well. it sounds more like you let your disappointment ruin the night then it sounds like your gf was rude. time spent with her cleaning is still time spent together and one hour is not enough time to make a difference in a multi-movie plan unless you changed your mind and cut things short because you were upset.", "It doesn't sound like you actually did anything and you seem to already regret being annoyed so you're unlikely to act on it in the future. \n\nShit happens. She needed to clean. NAH", "ESH, but no assholes, exactly\n\nIf you agreed to a specific time to hang out, and do a specific thing at that, your GF doing household chores while you're over is shitty. It's nothing she couldn't have done before or after your time together. \n\nPeople are giving you shit in the comments that it may have only been \"implied\" that you'd both take care of other stuff before you hang out together.....but that's what you **should** do when you make plans to spend time with someone.\n\nYou take care of things in advance or schedule them for later so that you can give your full attention to the other person.\n\nThat said, you should have objected very clearly instead of \"offering to help\" or not saying anything. You had already planned to hang out together doing a specific activity. Yeah, it would've been nice if she kept to that, but sometimes you have to get your partner back on track, and vice a versa. It happens sometimes.\n\nNot feeling well isn't an excuse for not speaking up for yourself in a romantic relationship. It's an excuse for resolving an extended conflict later, but not for having a short conversation.", "NTA.\n\nShe should have either accepted your help or done her chores before you got there - this was supposed to be a planned evening of relaxation between the two of you.\n\nWhile not relationship ending, if this behaviour becomes more frequent it might be.\n\nSo ask her why she decided to do those while you were there, why she wasted your time together like that. (And use the term wasted - as that was what it was)", "YTA. You were late, so she started working on things. Do you really expect her to just sit and do nothing while waiting for you? You admit you are both very busy. So it's not like she has another full day to do all the cleaning, she likely was just finally in a mental and physical place to get it done. Also, you were running on knowing what you implied and assumed. She has no clue what assumptions you made. Communication is necessary and it must be clear, not implied.", "on reddit you're a middle aged white man until proven otherwise", "NTA - but be careful how you approach the conversation. Assuming you've told us everything you know, it's absolutely fair for you to be annoyed, but there could be some reason she wasn't able to get things done before you got there. You're not an AH for having feelings, but that doesn't automatically make her the AH instead. Seems like something you guys could work through with a serious conversation", " NAH. Communicate with your gf.", "NTA You can\u2019t be an AH for your feelings. Especially if you are not treating your partner adversely as a result. If you communicate better with you partner it will go a long way next time.", "After edit 2 I vote NTA. You literally talked about this. Plus, your partner must understand the long covid and its impacts on your energy. To me, she should've either done it before you came over or after you left, especially because of the time in between your visits.", "We need more info: if they asked or expected you to drive over then they double booked then...nta\n\nMoreover, were your obligations unavoidable? How critical was their laundry, cleaning, etc ...how long did u sit by yourself after driving over?\n\n Id be pissed if my partner i hadnt seen in two weeks told me come over for a few hours on a work day then decided they needed to do their chores during that time...", "OP was late cause she had chores. So it's okay that OP put off her girl for chores, but her girl can't have OP wait while she finishes inish the chores she were doing?", ">And if your implying what I think you are by the low energy and expressing your feelings part,\n\nwhat does this mean", "When you get limited time together because you only see your partner a few times a month (or a year, in the case of LDRs), yes you **do** get to expect that you give each other your full attention when you spend time together.\n\nIt doesn't need to be a more-serious get-dressed-up date, but household chores can absolutely be pushed off to any of the other 18-20 hours in the day. Or one of the other 6 days in the week.", "It's entirely rude of the GF. And if anything, you **should** be treating your SO with more respect than other guests. OP's GF should have pushed the basic house chores to any other time of the day than the 2-4 hours they'd already agreed to spend together.\n\nEveryone in the comments saying OP should just put up with it is immature, has bad time management skills, or is unwilling to set boundaries in their own relationships due to a lack of self-respect.", "They agreed on the time but the gf decided to do chores so yes she shouldn't", "What other people have said more eloquently above - the world doesn't stop because OP is there. I think OP should give her more grace - maybe she was busy and just didn't have time to do that stuff before, maybe she didn't expect to be too tired for the movie marathon. Maybe she changed her mind and didn't feel like a movie marathon in the moment. Those things happen in any serious relationship and aren't a big deal imo.\n\nI feel like a more mature reaction would be for OP to be grateful to spend time with his gf even if she wasn't in top date form, not to be disappointed because she didn't cater to him.\n\nI could see it becoming a problem if it became a pattern and the gf never wanted to do anything fun, but there's no indication that that's the case.", "This is a very good point.", "obv the movie in question was the extended edition of the fellowship of the ring", "Then why tell your partner u havnt seen in 2weeks to drive over then not hang lol? Info is missing here imho...", "Hers. They are both women", "And OP was late for the agreed time too.", "(can anyone explain to me why this is getting downvoted so much? i feel like im missing something)", "I mean sometimes I like my significant other around even when I'm just doing everyday mundane chores because having them with me is just nice. I don't know if that's what's going on in this situation, I do agree there could be other things that need to be taken into account but I'm just going off my experience.", "because it's still better than not seeing them at all?", "My apologies. Doesn't change my opinion though.", "But she got there and the gf did chores so... That's rude you have a guest (your partner in this case) you don't do that.", "Welcome to the sub.\n\nAny explanation when top comments are Y T A, is almost always downvoted. Even if it\u2019s just to provide info that a commenter asked for", "OP got there late. OP says she would have gone over earlier, but had chores that delayed her. Was GF just to sit there and twiddle her thumbs waiting for OP to get done with chores and finally make it?  GF finished what she was working on while waiting for OP.", " NAH.", "YTA. I feel like you're slightly overreacting. \n\nYou had things you did in the morning, which you admit drained your energy. She only spent 1 hour doing her thing cleaning. If you couldn't be there for more than a couple hours, I'm not sure why you went exactly. Is there a reason you couldn't spend the night? \n\nEither way, it only took her an hour. Maybe she spent the morning relaxing because she was tired? She sounds incredibly busy. It's okay for her to relax sometimes too. \n\nI'm not sure, but I don't feel like an hour is really something to be upset over. If she ignored you all night or something? Sure. And please keep in mind that she probably didn't let you help clean because of your energy levels.", "NTA , if you were dating a man all of the Y TA judgments would be screaming\n\n>OH MUH GERD WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE!!!!", "She was home all day? Yup. Could have cleaned before you came, OP. NTA.", "Yes, you are.", "I have chronic fatigue.  It can suck at times but that doesn't mean that I get to dump all that on my significant other.\n\nOP had thing she needed to do before she went to the GFs place.  OP openly admitted she didn't know what her GF did all day.  Maybe the GF was running behind with her own errands. \n\nFor the GF to be an ass she would have had to do something egregious and she didn't.  She straightened up her place where she lives.  It's not like she did a deep clean that took her 8 hours.  \n\nOP is overreacting.  Sometimes life gets in the way of being with your partner and if you are willing to accept that as part of a partnership than a partnership should not be formed.\n\nHaving low energy doesn't mean that chilling in bed while watching a movie is going to be taxing.  And if you knew you where already getting tired from your errands maybe reschedule.\n\nI'm not saying anyone is an asshole.  You asked if you were overreacting, the answer is a yes for me.  You didn't ask if you where an asshole.  So I will not infer that was what you wanted to know.\n\nYou just have to remember humans are not carbon copies of one another.  We all have our own emotions, thought processes, etc.  We just have to be able to weave in and out, make compromises, and sometimes even with all that plans don't always go as planned.  And that is okay.  And sometimes overreacting can happen.  But you didn't yell, scream, or throw a fit.  However, if that was what you did and you omitted it that yea that is an asahole mood.
