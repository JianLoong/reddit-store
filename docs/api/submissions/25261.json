Sterilizing a person who has 10+ kids already is sane population control. \n\nPersonally my number would be far lower, but most people could get behind a limit of 10 aside the quiverful freaks and serial deadbeat baby daddies.", "It is because they're breeding their superior line and killing people usually lands you in jail these days.", "Less horrifying when ypu think of all the pregnancies the women will have to suffer since they outlawed abortions. Seems like fair trade to me", "I agree Cannibis cat slave", "Most \"self made\" rich people are just trust fund babies with a chip on their shoulder about it.", "It is in no way less horrifying, wtf are you on? The fact that one of those has happened and needs to be stopped doesnt make either less horrific.", "Uh, no, it's still incredibly horrifying.  We need to work on fixing atrocities, not making more of them.", "I thought it was OPs daughter getting married? So wouldn\u2019t it be father of the bride?", "Old enough to be her grandfather.", "Ah, so this is Succession. I thought that was only on streaming. Congrats on your Emmy!", "NTA- You told him the truth. Whether he accepts it or not is up to him.", "YTA. For a father you claim you are not involved with and whom you don't need, you seem awfully invested in what he does with his life and why he does it.\n\nIf you have no financial dependence on your father, absentee or not, then let him get on with his own life. It's none of your business. \n\nWe all die alone. You may have thought you were saying something cutting, but you merely stated a fact. You may think he's an asshole for how he chooses to live his life, but it's HIS LIFE. You don't get say, you don't get a vote.  At age 76, this man is doing exactly what he wants, and how he wants. If he can get a 26 year old girlfriend, more power to him. MYOB.", "NTA -  His life style is his choice but it reflects badly on him to be so uncaring about all his children and wives and women and whatnot.  It just seems sad to me. He's probably looking for love and doesn't really know what it is so he never feels loved . . . I'm guessing. I almost feel sorry for him like I do other narcissists . . and then I catch myself. I suppose nobody will miss him when he is gone but probably will be relieved  . . .  If it weren't for the money he would probably have nobody.", "NTA we can't choose our parents.", "NTA but your sperm donor (and that's the nicest possible thing he can be considered) absolutely is.", "NTA.", "He did not father children alone. \"Some men are no better than tomcats??\"  some women were there, too.  Evaluate your partner before pregnancy.", "18 kids and 11 baby mommas? That\u2019s going to be one hell of a will reading. \n\nNTA.", "My ex\u2019s dad was the redneck equivalent of OP\u2019s dad, lmao.", "I paid for my daughter's wedding. He gave her a gift.", "It\u2019s his kid\u2019s wedding, not his own. It wasn\u2019t his choice to accept the money or not.", "Right? I would had been done with that sperm donor a looong time ago", "OP didn't say anything about him pay for a lavish wedding.  They said he gave a lavish gift.  Two very different things.", "Agreed. Just stay out of it. YTA.", "I have not received any money from him in thirty years.", "Which response do you object to?", "Strangely enough I did not invite him since it wasn't my wedding.", "Yeah, it used to be only the faithful Catholic families that had that many children! Lol!\n.Wow! 63 years! That's a lot! Lol, \"only 36 years\"!", "It won't even be his legacy, those kids won't remember him as dad and the moms will have already moved on/replaced him, hopefully with a nice man who will want to be a good husband and father. It's not blood that matters, but memories. Those kids will likely have 0 of him.", "I bet he has a Henry VIII complex", "Yeah, fair enough. That's why I don't get when these A. Tate worshippers say that men can father children until their parts don't work even with Viagra. I mean, sure, you can have dozens of kids and throw money at their moms to raise them, but that doesn't mean you SHOULD. A healthy masculine role model for young boys and girls is worth all the jewels in the world and I wish that more people would realize that.", "I have not taken a cent from him in thirty years.", "It does when ypu put the 2 together. So long as one is in effect so should the other. Deadbeat dad's don't deserve to keep reproducing. It needs to stop. If ypu can't take care of the kid ypu have then ypu don't have the right to keep making more", "[removed]", "Sounds sketch. I can't fault this girl at all, because... I don't trust the relationship.", "I'm not worried about deadbeat dads.  I'm worried about giving a government that is already woefully ignorant over issues of biology the ability to legally perform unwanted surgery upon its own populace.", "IT ALREADY DOES. You just care that it's suggested for men. Women have been subject to this for the entire lifetime of the country.", "NTA but you\u2019re also fooling yourself that you don\u2019t need his money. You took his money. Shoot, I would have to! But at least recognize that you got a start because of his seed money. It\u2019d be better to say you don\u2019t care about getting any more money from him. :)", "Dude has a child who is young enough to be another child's *grandchild*. \n\nHe makes our not-blended-family with 7 kids spanning 26 years look reasonable.\n\nAlso, NTA.  There's an episode series of iyanla fix my life that has a dude similar to your father. Eesh.", "ESH why say all that to him on your kid\u2019s wedding day? Save the drama for another day.", "Sounds like you gladly take his money just like everyone else does. Used his money to buy a home which set you up for financial success at a young age, plus whatever other gifts he\u2019s given you and your family that you didn\u2019t mention. You invited him and he brought his WIFE, no matter how young she is. Then you tell her not to talk about her marriage concerns but think it\u2019s appropriate to try to call your dad out on his lifestyle at the wedding? YTA", "So \n\n>She asked me if my dad was cheating on her. I said I didn't know that much about my father's life but she needed to not talk about that shit at my kids wedding.\n\nBut you\n\n>I talked with my dad and asked him if he was already bored of this girl and he said \"no of course not\" which means yes. \n\nApplying your standard for what's appropriate conversation at a wedding.\n\nYTA", "YTA and so is your father. You could have just shut up at your daughter's wedding.", "Lol it sounds like you did need his money.\n\nHis money allowed you to buy that house and create a nestegg.  Your dad is not physically there for you, but his money is.\n\nYou may not suck up but you definitely accept his money.  I'm sorry that ur not a self-made person thanks to daddy.  You are ambitious for sure", "Is your dad Dog the Bounty Hunter?", "So you don't need or want his money now but were perfectly happy to take it all those years ago to buy your house (and launch yourself into adulthood)? And his current wife can't ask if he's cheating on her at your kid's wedding, but you're more than happy to tell your father that he's going to die alone at her wedding? I guess I just find that aspect kind of odd but NTA, only you know your relationship with your father and he sounds like a worse version of Nick Cannon", "YTA. Your father is not going to die alone. He knows exactly what he is doing, and he is fine with it. He was not a good father to you and you are angry about it, but you weren\u2019t angry enough to refuse the four years of college that he paid for or to refuse the money he paid for your daughters wedding. You\u2019re a hypocrite.", "I feel like we are reading this in the future in the POV of one of Nick Cannons kids\u2026 NTA", "So far\u2026", "How did he bring drama to the wedding??? Sounds like you\u2019re filled with resentment and went searching for it", "The dudes layed about more than Jagger.\n\nWhat's funny is that I thought in my head \"this guy must be loaded\" before I read it.\n\nNTA - People like that often live life not giving a shit about anyone but themselves and only give token gifts to appease their conscience. \n\nWhat's sad is that he may never have to face the music, he could very well go to grave living in delusion while goldiggers line up with shovels.", "maybe it was OPs dad\ud83d\ude02", "You sound like you\u2019ve gained a lot/gotten to where you are now because of the check he wrote you though. Most college aged kids can\u2019t buy a home with a check and then gain income by renting it out to other students. \n\nIf you claim you want nothing to do then go no contact with him?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t invite them then shut the baby mamas comment down and move on. I understand being upset because he doesn\u2019t give any love or attention but it sounds as if he\u2019ll never change.. I mean he\u2019s had 11 chances?? It\u2019s shitty but move on. Don\u2019t blow up at him at your daughters wedding. \n\nESH.", "OP's father sounds quite Muskian", "What do you mean that many children? Julio Sr only had 4 kids. Julio Iglesias born in 1943, Carlos, probably born in the 40s, Jamie in 2004 and Ruth in 2006. 4 kids is not a big family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Julio Jr has 8 kids, that's more the big family you're talking about."]}
