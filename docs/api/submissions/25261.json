He didn't marry all of them and I don't think he sees all of his children. The oldest is my half sister Sara 56, the youngest is my half brother David 5. I'm 48. \n\nMy father came to my daughter's wedding last weekend. He brought David's mother. She is younger than my daughter. \n\nMy father is rich so most people suck up to him. He gave me a check to cover all four years of university when I got in. I used it to buy a house since he was so uninvolved in my life he didn't even know I had a full scholarship. \n\nI'm not on his level but I'm well off. The house I bought 30 years ago has increased astronomically in value. Renting rooms to my classmates during my university tenure have me a nice nest egg to start my business and my family. I still rent it out to university students. \n\nSorry for the digression but I felt the need to explain why I do not suck up. I am not waiting for an inheritance or anything from him. I don't need or want his money. \n\nHe gave my daughter a very lavish wedding gift and made sure everyone knew it. Whatever. I spoke to his latest \"wife\" she seems nice enough but I can tell she is already looking for the exit. She asked me if my dad was cheating on her. I said I didn't know that much about my father's life but she needed to not talk about that shit at my kids wedding.  \n\nI talked with my dad and asked him if he was already bored of this girl and he said \"no of course not\" which means yes. \n\nI told him he was going to die alone and the only people that were going to miss him were going to be his tailor and his vintner. I told him he needs to actually be a father to his youngest kids and a grandfather and a great grandfather. I told him to settle down with this girl and behave himself. \n\nHe said I'm an asshole for judging him and how he chooses to live his life. I think he is an asshole for how he chooses to live his life.", "created_utc": 1692717840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y909l/aita_for_telling_my_father_he_will_probably_die/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
