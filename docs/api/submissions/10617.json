When you meet friends who don\u2019t speak your mother tongue, the common ground is to speak English. I recently moved in with my roommate and one of my bestfriends, Leslie (26F) whom I speak English with. \n\nOn Saturday, we were going to a concert together and we were looking forward to it for weeks. We were supposed to meet two of her friends at the concert venue that I never met before and who speak Leslie\u2019s mother tongue. I am not shy but I am an introvert and I have anxiety. I usually have the fear of feeling left out in a group I don\u2019t know. Thus, while driving to the concert venue, I asked Leslie if we could speak in English with her friends since I don\u2019t speak their mother tongue. She immediately reassured me saying \u00ab\u00a0of course, was planning on it, don\u2019t worry!\u00a0\u00bb (as her friends also speak English). \n\nWhen arriving at the concert venue, I greeted her friends and everything seemed to be good for a couple of minutes til they started speaking in their mother tongue. At first, I was asking Leslie what they were saying to participate but then, I stopped doing it because I felt like I was intruding. I waited for a while thinking they were just happy to see each other but then 30 minutes passed and nothing changed. I was sitting at the end of the row so I felt even more left out. I started to feel really pissed because I wanted to meet her friends and enjoy the concert but at this point, I was just feeling alone. \n\nJust before the concert started, I suddenly told Leslie \u00ab\u00a0you are aware I don\u2019t speak your mother tongue, right ?\u00a0\u00bb. She seemed taken aback by my remark, as if she remembered I was there and then, tried to summarize what was just said but I responded \u00ab no, don\u2019t bother\u00a0\u00bb. I know it was probably petty of me but I was feeling very anxious and disappointed by my friend\u2019s behavior. The concert then started and I tried to enjoy it as best as I could but I could see Leslie glancing towards me several times during the songs. She seemed kinda uneasy. She tried to do small talk but I was more interested at the songs. \n\nAfter the concert, they resumed talking in their mother tongue. We eventually left and I didn\u2019t talk to Leslie at all on the way home. I was tired and honestly thought she would initiate the conversation. \n\nThe day after, we didn\u2019t talk either. I started feeling guilty because I wondered if I ruined her concert experience by making my remark. Her friends probably think I am annoying too. I decided to send her a text expressing my feelings and she apologized, saying she feels guilty about what happened. It seemed kinda forced and since then, we still haven\u2019t talked normally and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nMy friends are backing me up saying they understand my frustration, esp since I asked her before the concert if we could speak English but I can\u2019t help but wonder if I am the asshole.", "created_utc": 1677056429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118tedq/aita_for_ruining_my_friends_concert_experience/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That would upset me, too. You\u2019re not the asshole here, she is. \nI know sometimes it\u2019s a relief to speak another language you haven\u2019t spoken in a long time, and you let them have some time to do that, which was kind of you, but they should have stopped speaking it when you were asking for a translation if they all spoke English. \nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that, OP.", "NTA you ruined nothing\n\nThey were incredibly rude!", "She may have been meeting up with the others, but she went to the concert with YOU.

If Leslie doesn\u2019t approach you then you should consider starting the conversation to mend the issue.", "You're gaslighting yourself into feeling guilty for behavior that you and your friend both know was wrong and that she apologized for. Don't do that to yourself.\n\nNTA.", "I am multilingual, and my friends are also multilingual. But when I am with them, it's natural for me to speak my mother tongue with them. Speaking other languages just doesn't feel natural to us.\n\nWhen I lived abroad in a country I barely knew the language, I would go to parties and hangouts with friends I made there and I would be the only one who didn't speak their language. Although everyone spoke English, they would speak English to me but in their mother tongue to each other. It's natural for them to do this.\n\nYour friend can't be at fault for the fact that you don't speak her mother tongue. And while she tried to speak in English in the beginning, the conversation naturally gravitated towards her mother tongue. She is not at fault for this.\n\nYou need to accept that sometimes, you will feel like the third wheel in situations like this. Use experiences like this to come out of your shell a bit more and control the conversation - as I did when I lived abroad in a country I didn't speak the language. Next time, for example, try sitting between them so they have no other option than to interact with you.\n\nYou complained about her not sticking to your agreement during the concert, and she tried to redeem herself by talking to you but you were mad by then and didn't interact with her. Later, you complained through text, and she apologized. Accept the apology and extend an olive branch to her. You're NTA and neither is she.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m sure you guys will be fine - just go hang out. But passive aggressiveness is never a good look \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be the odd one out and sometimes it\u2019s really uncomfortable, but that\u2019s just how it is sometimes", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin their concert experience they ruined yours. If the feiends also speak english I don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t speak it to include you", "Nta. I live in a multilingual region and we make sure to include people. It wasn't nice to exclude you if they can speak the same language or if not, your friend should have helped. Especially since you asked on the way there.", "ESH they were rude, but then you were passive aggressive. You made your point that they were excluding you, then didn't want to be included after that. Petty", "She hasn\u2019t been speaking to you because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong.  Speaking a language that not everyone knows, when there is one everyone does know, is incredibly rude. You are NTA. She and her friends were rude and ruined the night. I hope the concert part was enjoyable.", "NTA, it\u2019s a naturally awkward situation. I have anxiety too and I used to date a French man but he lived here in England. Whenever we met up with his mates (also French) they would speak in French therefore excluding me. It was hard work and very uncomfortable, but I tried to understand it was the group more than my boyfriend. I can see why your friend felt guilty, hopefully she won\u2019t do it again.", "YTA", "Or at least her friends are rude and she doesn't have the backbone to stand up to them", "You are right\u2026 Since my friend\u2019s behavior is still odd towards me, I can\u2019t help thinking I did something wrong. But I guess it just shows how she truly is when she is in the wrong", "Ah not everyone is the same mate. In your perspective you may be able to deal with it. But then she had mentioned she was an introvert and she got uncomfortable and she already requested if it's okay to speak. \n\nSo the least her friend could do was include her in the conversations even if she spoke her mother tongue with her friends which she didn't. \n\nIt wasn't the language but the fact that OP felt she wasn't in the picture and the whole concert she felt alone. So i guess friend should apologise and maybe communicate to help.", "Exactly. And you're letting it play with your mind. Forget about it and let it blow over in the next couple of days. A year from now neither of you will remember what happened.", "Of course no one is the same. I recognized she was an introvert that is why I suggested she ought to approach these situations as the perfect setting to try and work on becoming more communicative, or, come out of her shell. \n\nRegarding her friend and the \"translation\", I'd like you to consider the following: translators only translate one language at a time. Sign language interpreters only interpret sign language from one person at a time. It is very hard to translate on the fly.\n\nHow did you expect OP's friend to talk to her friends, listen to these replies, reply to them, and then translate everything that was said to OP and repeat the whole process all over again every 10 seconds? It's impossible! As someone who has tried to do this is the past, let me tell you: it's tiresome, stressful, annoying and breaks the flow of the conversation. Again, it's not OP's friend's fault OP can't speak her friend's native tongue. I'd go further and say, if OP comes from a multilingual nation where most people speak 2-3 languages, why does OP's friend speak multiples languages while OP only speaks the one language? Shouldn't we be asking OP what she was doing in language class while everyone else was paying attention?\n\nOP's friend made a \"promise\" and didn't keep it, thats true. But the friend's friends didn't make such promise. They had no obligation to speak the one language most convenient to one single person in the whole group.", "Yeah what you said initially is true. She needs to work on communication and stuff but that's on her. \n\nI wasn't talking about translating each sentence though. I was telling to include her by switching the language up to English and telling about her and or making them ask questions etc some way or the other so that she doesn't feel left out. \n\nAnd i think it's not the OPs fault for not knowing the language which her friends speak. I don't think OP said she speaks only one language... She just said she doesn't speak the language that her roommate speaks.", "I agree. It's not her fault she doesn't speak the language, but it's not everyone else's fault either. Since OP said the common language is English but many people speak 2/3 languages, I assume she could be from India, Ireland or an African country. Regardless, the same standard applies. \n\nI've been in many multilingual/multicultural environments and no one has ever complained when people speak a language they don't understand. The common courtesy is to await your turn and get in the conversation when you can. \n\nIt's not nice to be in this situation. I've been in it many times. But you can't force people to do something just because it's more convenient to you.\n\nI don't OP is an AH for being mad about this, but neither is her friend. That's just how it is. Since OP is from a multilingual nation, I would expect her to know this.", "Yeah fair enough i understand your perspective. And yeah you never said the OP was an AH... You said both weren't in the end.", "YTA. Why would a whole group make an effort to speak English just because of YOU? Talk about entitlement.\n\nI've been in a similar situation as you, but just accepted that a big group of friends who wants to relax and have fun would not need to cater for my shortcomings.\n\nYour friend may have promised you, but if the entire group was not in the same boat, there was little she could do..", "NTA, that was rude as hell of them.", "Because we live in a multilingual country and the common ground is English ? When I hang out with my friends and Leslie is there, we all make an effort to speak English even tho my friends are way more comfortable in our mother language. Some of them don\u2019t even speak good English but they still try. It\u2019s not entitlement, it\u2019s just being inclusive.", "I understand it in a restaurant or office, but a concert? They just wanted to relax, let it go, speak their native language which is more comfortable and natural for them. You were the odd one out for a while, but that's to be expected In a multilingual country.", "Agreed. And play translator WHILE in a concert is super stressful AND unnecessary. She was there for the music or for the chat?", "ESH\n\nLook I get it, she should have realised the issue and changed the langauge to English, especially after you pre-empted it. But sometimes people get lost in the moment. Not once did you remind her or ask the group about changing language. You just chipped in a bit (which gave the impression that you weren't bothered) and then made a snippy comment. After that Leslie tried to engage you but you just ignored her. And then expected her to speak to you on the way home, after you were obviously annoyed? You were just passive aggressive tbh and it wasn't necessary. People make mistakes, so communicate it and move on. If you'd have reminded her, things could have been fine and then you wouldn't have stayed mad and she wouldn't have felt bad either. It's just a classic case of chopping your nose off to spite your face and is just a waste of time.\n\nShe sucks a bit for not being more aware. But honestly, people aren't infallible.", "NTA. If she feels guilty, it\u2019s because she should - she realized that she was being extremely rude to you, and you aren\u2019t required to relieve her guilt for her.", "NTA- I\u2019m absolutely all for people being able to talk whatever language they want, whenever, and where ever they want, but if you agreed to speak in a language everyone that understands, to include everyone, then that\u2019s what you should do, instead of making someone feel left out and basically ignoring them and blocking them from being apart of your conversations the entire time.", "I would've been extra petty and said , \"well since you guys ignored me , spoke in your mother tongue after I asked if we could all speak English so I can get to know you guys better and possibly form a friendship , you guys can continue on catching up as you take Leslie home I'm out \u270c\ud83c\udffd\"", "NTA. \n\nshe's not really your friend \n\nwhen you asked her something basic and she went ahead and completely ignored you, so she could talk to her friends. She chose to inconvenience you and exclude you because it was easier than to make everyone else talk in English. \n\nShe's not your friend.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you worried you ruined your friend's concert experience? She had a wonderful time at the concert with her friends.\n\nIt's you who was the afterthought. She should worry about ruining the concert experience for you...", "Well maybe you do that but it's not everyone. When there is someone with my group of friends who doesn't speak out mother tongue but understands English we all will speak English. In really big groups where not everyone is engaged in the same conversation people are speaking their mother tongue with each other when the one who doesn't speak it is not part of the sub group right now. And frankly: talking to people you know well in another language than your \"usual\" does only feel weird in the beginning but if you've done it a few times you won't even think about it. And I don't live in a multilingual country where that would be even more common.", "You have to explain why."]}
