Your niece gets a bed. She can't just sleep on the floor every time she needs to leave the bedroom to use the bathroom or talk to her mom.\n\nYou and sister need to find a compromise.

You're probably getting some NTA votes because reddit has empathy problems and lacks nuance, I think you are most definitely TA. \n\nIt is okay for a kid to make some temporary sacrifices for her homeless cousin. People adjust to new noises at night. I shared a room with my sister for the first 12 years of our lives and neither of us lost any sleep over it because it was normal. I'm sure that you've been in situations where new noises kept you up for a bit, but you adjusted and began to sleep through them. Could you daughter wear ear plugs?\n\nNo, your sister can't be doing the bedtime routine more than once a night unless she keeps the kid with her. But I think you should also consider why your niece might be asking for that. She's 7 years old, afraid of the dark, she's been displaced, she knows she's not welcome. This is probably incredibly stressful and scary for her. Wanting to kick them out over this really betrays an appalling level of selfishness on your part, OP. God forbid you should ever find your family needing a place to stay. You would be shocked by how quickly a life can implode these days. Even upper middle class families are at risk of losing everything under the right conditions. \n\nI understand that you live in a small space and this is hard on you, but I notice some callousness in how you've handled things with your niece. I can't imagine you'd be perfectly okay with someone locking your child out of the room she's meant to sleep in. I think that if you and your child were in the position your sis is in, you would expect your kid to be treated with more compassion than you are extending to your niece.\n\nMaybe instead of sending your sister and her small child to fend for themselves on the street or in a shelter, you could get an air mattress for the living room that your sister or niece could sleep on so your daughter doesn't have to share her room. They can deflate it and store it during the day.\n\nDo you have other relatives who might be better suited to host your sister and your niece? If so, could you talk to your sister and reach out to them together? Could you and your partner help your sister come up with a plan and a timeline for getting back on her feet?\n\nFinally, while you certainly have the right to kick your sister out, you should be prepared for your relationship to be permanently damaged and possibly destroyed if you do. If your sister didn't have a child in the picture, there would almost certainly be room for repair, but kicking a mother with a 7 year old out is not something many relationships could recover from.

Teach her patience and empathy for her cousin (who is going through an emotionally traumatic time as it is, which is much more of a hardship than a rough nights sleep) so that she doesn\u2019t get so frustrated if/when she is woken up. \n\nRight now you\u2019re teaching your daughter that if someone who is traumatized and homeless is having a hard time settling then she should punish that person further instead of helping them feel comforted and safe which would likely help her settle faster. This transition will take time for everyone to adjust to but your handling of the situation is likely making it worse.
