It\u2019s been about 5 months now and we decided to meet face to face. He lives across the country from me but said he would visit me. We talked about him visiting but not the details of it.\n\nA couple weeks ago I found a date that works for my wife and I for him to visit.

I was getting the feeling he may think that he was going to stay at my house when visiting but when talking my we decided we were uncomfortable letting him stay at our house. We have a two year old , he was wanting to stay a whole week, and I\u2019d like to have my own space without having him constantly around me while meeting him for the first time.\n\nWhen I called him he was really excited but once I said he couldn\u2019t stay at my place he got really upset. Started saying things like, \u201cdo you actually want to see me?\u201d But generally just expressing how upset he was and disappointed because he couldn\u2019t afford a hotel.

I\u2019m a 32 year man with a wife and kid though who was raised by another man I call dad. It\u2019s odd to me that this stranger comes into my life to now, expects me to sum up 32 years of being raised to bestow on him. The whole thing just feels entitled to me.\n\nOverall I\u2019m sick of it and don\u2019t have time to play high school games.

You only know him through calls and texts. There are 1001 ways it could potentially go bad. You don't \"know\" him... not really. You let him stay, and things go south, you're stuck. You also have a young child. I'm sure you won't let another stranger around your kid. The same should go for the stranger whose only connection is DNA.", "NTA, he is expecting too much by staying with you.

Just because he\u2019s back doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept.  You have your own family to think of.  Move on.", "NTA, you are more than correct in being uncomfortable and him staying in your home and being as you\u2019re just getting to know him, it\u2019s  perfectly fine to set boundaries.", "NTA caution is wise. Is your Mum still around? Can she give any insight into his behaviour? His mental state? What is the reason he\u2019s been gone from your life for this long? Did he want to have contact with you before now? What was preventing him being in contact?", "The only reason he suddenly turns up in your life is: HE NEEDS A PLACE TO LIVE.\n\nHe doesn't want to \"stay\" with you for a visit. He wants to move in. And once he is through the front door, he is never leaving.\n\nWhat is your interest in him, anyway? He's nothing to you but DNA. You don't know anything about him personally.\n\nAnd if you're a people-pleaser, you should read this sub-Reddit and learn what happens to the other people-pleasers in these stories.", "He sounds manipulative and is sulking till you give in. If he's asking if you \"even want to meet him\" because he is to stay in a hotel, one could ask if he even wants to meet you if he's not prepared to understand your concerns and pay for a cheap hotel. NTA", "I get it's complicated. But pretending there's no backstory and it's just a friend we're talking about: if he's paying to fly over it seems reasonable to host him for a few days.\n\nAnyway NTA because there *is* backstory and you aren't comfortable treating him like family/friend yet. For you this is a genuinely \"meeting him.\" And if he genuinely wants to build a relationship with you he needs to accept that you want to take it slow.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
