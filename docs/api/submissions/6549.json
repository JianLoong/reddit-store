Not sure I\u2019d want to die on this hill", "As long as it\u2019s a private setting outside, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s disgusting about it?", "YTA\n\nYou are just jealous that you can't just take out the willy and do a pee while a nice breeze hit your genitals.", "INFO:  How is his aim when he pees in the toilet?", "YTA to yourself if you stay with a man who wants to pee all over his backyard, just because you guys had a kid.", "YTA It's his body, you can't have that much control over it. Also peeing outside is a really liberating feeling, for some people it helps connect with nature. You could consider trying it sometime then you might know how he feels.", "Info: Why is he so focused on this? Does he have a history of peeing outside? Why does he care so much about it?", "In most suburbs in the US, whipping out your business to pee in public is considered Public Indecency and can get you a nice fine and some time in lock up while the nice police officer processes your paperwork.

He asked for a designated pee spot?  He gets points for that. \n\nDo not do a designated pee spot in the grass - it\u2019ll kill it. \n\nWhat a crack up.", "**You should research this** on the website of your Town Hall  within their Municipal Ordinances in reference thereto because most will say that when it comes to public urination alone, the violation is not a disorderly persons offense but an ordinance violation with a civil penalty, a high fine, and potentially community service and jail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IMHO this is both disrespectful and uncouth!**", "INFO: where did you find a talking dog?", "NTA but has he said *why* he wants to pee outside so badly?", "If this was me I'd be looking into the possibility of buying some of that super hydrophobic paint they used in Hamburg that shoots the pee back at the miscreant.", "NTA.

My kids (both boys), went through a stage where they just HAD to pee outside, no idea why, I just told them to use the compost pile so the compost got the benefit of all the nitrogen, and moved on in life.  They outgrew it, and use the toilet now.  Kinda a weird argument to be having with an adult male, imo.  You'd think a grown man would be smart enough to know when it's not appropriate, but maybe I'm being overly optimistic there.", "Someone like this?? \n\nSo, peeing outside directly equates to he has to be a shitty partner??", "This is absolute BULLSHIT. \n\nA disturbed person with sexual interest in exposing himself???

Urine is 95% water, and if you're properly hydrated, there should be little to no smell.  Unless he's eating a ton of asparagus or other high sulfur food?  Strong urine smells are also associated with diabetes and UTI's.  I mean, this doesn't solve your issue with him wanting to pee outside, but if you're concerned because he has smelly urine, you might mention to him to increase his water intake or check in with his doctor.", "Most horse owners I know pee in horse stalls when there's not a bathroom available or the porta potty available is disgusting.

Woman in my parents old neighborhood got in trouble because she moved in next to a 2 story house and kept sunbathing buck naked in her back yard in clear view of their window. \nIm not necessarily saying I agree with it, just that I know people are nosey and that if it\u2019s a topic that comes up enough for OP to be worried about it, someone is eventually going to see man\u2019s shwanging his junk around outdoors when he should just use his big boy pants and go to a toilet.", "Public urination is absolutely a crime in the US"]}
