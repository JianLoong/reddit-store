Is that a realistic situation?\n\nYou might think it's gross, but it's not harming anything. Grow up, and stop making a big deal out of nothing.", "LOL, OK seriously NTA, but I have a funny story. My late father used to teach my nephews to do this. There were 3 of them and when they would visit my parents they would go off the back driveway. Now, they lived in a remote area with no neighbors watching, but still. Thankfully they've turned into normal adults who use bathrooms now.", "YTA sorta.  I get it, but it's really not a big deal if he does it once in a while.  Pro tip: install a urinal in the garage.  He'll be so tickled he'll pee there instead.", "YTA\n\nAs long as he isn't out on the front lawn shaking his dick at the neighbors, there's nothing wrong with taking a piss outside on your property. That's where piss traditionally goes, outside.", "First pee of the day outside in the brisk morning air is wonderful! But I gave it up when living in the city. Really depends on how small the yard is, but don't underestimate the joy he's being denied having to pee in the house.\n\nMaybe let him pee outside when it's raining?\n\nNAH", "I can't see the big deal here. I live in the suburbs, and my husband does this all the time. Also, it qaa always a common thing at parties for men to skip the bathroom line and leave it clean for the girls. Maybe that is a 'country' attitude, but my main complaint is that it isn't fair! I want to be able to go pee behind a tree!", "That\u2019s hilarious!!!", "I just laughed out loud.", "It's completely normal to do that though. It's something that happens at maybe 90% of outdoor parties I've ever been to", "Totally with you babe!", "In the country where you can get away from the house it\u2019s different. My stepdad is 79. He lives in the country, but he\u2019s too old to walk very far from the house just to pee, so there\u2019s a gross spot not that far from the house. He refuses to use the toilet except in the middle of the night. He just doesn\u2019t understand how gross that spot is. He\u2019s used it so often all the grass died in that spot.", "Do you have a funnel? My wife likes it because she can stand. Useful for backpacking and hiking", "Depends on the state, your allowed to walk around in the public park naked in my state", "Wait what do you mean record it? Do you mean in a log book or journal or like video tape it and upload that to the internet, because that would actually be a crime.", "lol, right? the last dude I lived with, I would have banished him from ever peeing indoors if that was an option.", "If he wants to connect to nature then he can go to the woods not ruin the yard", "I think you could ask any guy if they've ever peed in a backyard before and almost every single one of them would say they had. The only exceptions I can think of are people who grew up and lived in cities their whole lives and I'm sure all of them have pissed in an alley or something roughly equivalent before.", "Did they name her Nina Tucker?", "Several of my friend, who have pools, have designated pee spaces outside that can be used to avoid tracking water through the house while swimming.  But, it would never occur to me to use the space when I was dry and could walk through the house without creating a wet mess.", "I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve never peed outside. But not in my backyard and not in the middle of a party", "Interesting. I\u2019ve hosted and attended probably 100 outdoor events and never had anyone pee outside - unless it\u2019s in the woods. Whatever works", "Ew, Just because it's normalized doesn't mean it's okay. What is it about having a dick that makes guys think that spraying their bio-hazardous bodily fluid where ever they want should be allowed. We invented toilets for a reason. Use them.", "The reason is i have to pee and i am not inside, i am outside. I have a spetic with a leech field, so that pee literally ends up in the same place if i pee inside.", "Okay, a lived hypothetical for you. I lived in the suburbs, I'm in my backyard gardening. I have a fence and privet hedges, hell, I even had an outdoor shower. Let's say I'm gardening, or better yet I'm just walking around barefoot in my backyard enjoying the sunshine and nice grass. I have to pee, am I going to track dirt and grass through my house to go to the bathroom inside or am I just going to pee on a tree in the back of my yard? Nearly 100% of the time I'm peeing on that tree.", "Do you have a compost pile? If so, that could be a good compromise (urine is good for compost, and would be away from your daughter).", "I mean unless he's peeing in the middle of the yard, I don't see how your daughter is going to get into it. \n\nThis probably shouldn't be as big of a point of contention as it is, but I will say it would be nice to be able to take a quick leak outside if I'm doing yardwork or something, won't track in all the grass and dirt.", "Depends on how long you use the bathroom", "I hate to be the one to blow your mind but animals are coming through your yard pissing and shitting all over it constantly. Like what do you think dirt is made of?\n\nThe contribution of your guy pissing on a tree in the corner making your yard gross is quite literally like pissing into the ocean.", "In the summer, my husband goes off the side of the deck if we are outside.  We are in the country, so no neighbors to see.  No smell from him and we have 3 dogs using the yard for their business.", "good thing his yard is private", "You're not in public though you're peeing into a bush or something in your back yard.", "That may be true, but no-one who did not grow up on a farm would essentially demand a spot to pee outside.", "Surely it's less disgusting than pissing inside of your own house. I've never had to clean pee splatter off a tree before.", "I don't think this is happening in front of a brownstone in manhattan. I think it's more likely that this guy wants to pee into a bush in his back yard based off OP's hypothetical.\n\nYou can legally piss in your backyard everywhere in the US so long as you're privates aren't visible from the vantage of public property or so long as your neighbors can't reasonably be expected to see you do it. Basically you're allowed to be naked on your own property as long as you're not interfering with anything (conversely if you're mooning people through your street facing living room window you can get in trouble despite being inside).\n\nAlso the ground is made of dirt it's already disgusting", "Not even close to the same thing and you know it lol", "We do not bring that trauma in here!", ";-;", "E..d...war..d...", "Well that is just gross because you know that no one is hitting up the bathroom to wash their hands after pissing on the lemon tree.", "I came to the comments to say it's only okay if you have a lemon tree that has a nitrogen deficiency, lol.", "Do you by chance hold any royal titles?\n\nI grew up in a pretty ritzy area and it was still extremely common", "In this case kind of it does mean it's okay. You rather have 50 drunk partygoers spraying piss all over the rim of a toilet seat over the span of a night? I certainly do not. Let them piss where all the animals are already pissing and shitting every single day.", "Outside is where all the animals go. I grew up in the south and going outside was considered pretty normal.", "My suburb has no fences. Just houses and yards. If one of my neighbors was peeing outside, at least a dozen people would easily be able to see him.", "Yeah, fermenting human piss has a pretty distinct smell and one who knows what it is can sniff it out from a mile away, even outdoors.", "Peeing constantly in one spot not only builds up an odor but kills the grass in that spot. If it\u2019s once ir twice a week probably not, but on the regular basis this guy wants to will definitely create a gross m, smelly patch of dead grass.", "That really depends on where you live.  \n\n\nThe nearest major municipality to me (western US) allows full nudity in a privately owned yard even in full view of the public unless it can be specifically proved that the nude individual is exposing themselves specifically in order to bother other people.", "I think there legitimately might not be a single example of this happening even one time for pissing in your own back yard lol", ">If he is caught peeing outside he could be charged for a number of crimes, many of which qualify for the sex offender category\n\nOn his own property? Not likely.", "I don't get the fuss about the kid playing in the yard.

Public urination is a crime which automatically comes with the second crime of indecent exposure. If convicted,  you become a sex offender. I know it's enforced in New Orleans. Not sure about anywhere else.", "My husband's uncle lives in IA and is a registered sex offender for pissing outside too many times LMAO. He'd get drunk and piss in his yard. His NOSEY AF neighbor is constantly looking out her window and calls. Everytime we'd stop by she'd come out yelling the kids are too loud in the pool or I should wear a cover for my bathing suit cause my boobs are too big\ud83d\ude44. She was getting groceries out and yelled at my husband and uncle for not volunteering to help her. Halloween she puts her light on then just stares out her window at the people knocking.", "If it's visible to public view or neighbors they can still get you for indecent exposure and urinating in public.  My friend got busted because a cop was driving by and saw him but thankfully only gave him a warning and told him what could happen with the registration laws", "True.

I will check the family tree though. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve never peed outside. I haven\u2019t done it in my backyard during parties. And I\u2019m pretty sure plenty of people don\u2019t pull their dicks out and piss in the backyard when they have a party and guests are there. Not saying it doesn\u2019t happen - but shockingly enough my friends include everyone from teachers to Gi\u2019s to bartenders and retail workers. None of us host an event at our homes and yards and and then pull out our dicks and piss in a bush. So not royalty, but not pissing in front of guests at parties!", "... Yes? Piss on a toilet seat can be cleaned and disinfected. Piss on the ground in my backyard is going to stink and unless you've got a big rain coming in, it lingers. Not to mention it'll kill your grass/plants. I would 100% want 50 drunk party goers to at least attempt toilet use rather than turn my yard into their personal toilet. \n\nAnimals may already piss and shit outside, but they're not all aggregating in my yard to do it. There's a difference between one animal occasionally peeing an animals worth of piss in the gravel vs 50+ full grown humans emptying their alcohol filled bladders(multiple times each most likely) in your yard in one night. \n\nIf there's a toilet you can use, then there's no excuse to not use it.", "This is such a ridiculous line of logic.  So by your twisted worldview having shower that has a window in it is sus or changing in your bedroom with windows also public nudity.", "Full Ray, yes. Litter, no!! Haha! Love this comment! Living in a place now that the foundation radiates pee smell. Too many outdoor cats decided the front of this unit is their litter box. Warm days, my place smells like piss. Gotta move!", "This may be controversial to say, but cops often cite bullshit to scare people. California Penal Code Section 647a is Lewd conduct in public and does not mention urination. 314 is public urination, and it is a misdemeanor at best, requiring that \u201cthere are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby\u201d and that the offense must be done \u201cwillfully and lewdly.\u201d", "Weird. I can\u2019t find the statute that says that. Louisiana State statute 220b Article 120b section C says that exposing of the genitals as a sex offense MUST be done intentionally in an indecent manner. Statute 542 covers the people eligible to be on the sex offender registry and a simple public urination is not eligible by the statute.\n\nNew Orleans code Article V section 54-254 does state that public urination is a lewd act, BUT the possible penalties are a fine of minimum $100 and minimum 30 hours of trash cleanup.
