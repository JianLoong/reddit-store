Well played; fits this situation to a tee.\n\nOP, Bravo for eating a whole cake, that's an accomplishment in itself.  I'm very envious.  To be honest, I don't think your husband deserves neither a cake nor a present.  I'm sorry to say this but he does not seem at all supportive of you in the least.  When I was married, in the good years, I wanted to celebrate my birthday with no one more than my husband.  I didn't care if that meant getting burgers or a pizza and seeing a movie or going to a 5 star restaurant; it was all the same to me. The only important ingredient was him.  \n\nUnfortunately,  that doesn't seem to be the case with him; his priority was to spend it with his family.  The family who had blamed you for a miscarriage only months before and had not apologized.  And your husband didn't call them out on it.  Why? Why didn't he stand up for you and defend you? That is what you should be considering,  not whether you were right to eat a cake bought for him.  I think you are both misdirecting your anger onto a cake. The cake is not the issue here. The real issue is why he didn't support you with the miscarriage bashing, why he has chosen them over you to spend his birthday with?? And I wonder if he's picking the cake as a way to alienate himself even more from you? I can tell you had this happened to a man who was really in love with his wife, he would have apologized profusely for have not been home earlier to celebrate together and promised to make it right, going out for dinner tomorrow or something to make up for it.  I don't say this lightly but I would NOT get pregnant right now. You need to sit down with him and ask if he still wants to be married to you. If the answer is yes then tell him he needs to make you the priority and stand up for you.  If the answer is no then it's best to know now, pre-children and before you waste anymore of your time.
