If she wants to focus more on school, great, then she needs to find other means to support herself. You\u2019re not obligated to put your life on hold for anybody else. If she keeps arguing with you about it, it might be time to take a break and focus more on your schooling and yourself. I wish you the best of luck!", "You are not married. Also, she did not have the courtesy to discuss her change of focus and what quitting her job would mean for the both of you.\n\nNot only should you kick her out of the apartment, you should dump her immediately. Her poor communication skills and breathtakingly arrogant assumption of your economic support - to the detriment of your own education - demonstrates that she is not good girlfriend material, let alone a potential wife.\n\nNTA", "NTA: You should not sacrifice your future for someone else.  You are not married and do not owe her anything other than emotional support.", "Your her bf not her daddy.. how entitled.", "NTA. \n\nShe sounds selfish. I can see a scenario where you quit school, get two jobs to support her, she graduates and gets the dream job and leaves you in the dust. Either convince her to keep her current  schedule or make her move out, but DO NOT quit school for her. Do what\u2019s right for you and protect yourself.", "She's clearly telegraphing to you that she wants to start her slide into being financially supported by a man rather than working.\n\nShe's fully entitled to do whatever she wants.  You are not obligated to support her.  she has parents for that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell her you need support as well, and your current schedule is all you can handle. When she complains, just tell her she isn\u2019t being supportive. \n\nAnyway, just let her go. She is not thinking about you at all.", "NTA. She is selfcentered. If she want to focus on school and not work, she can move back to parents. There is absolutely no reason to support her just because she feels like it.", "NTA. Get a proper roommate.", "Info, because I\u2019m curious: what are your ages? \n\nRegardless, you\u2019re NTA. The absolute *audacity* of your GF to make a significant financial decision unilaterally that benefits her and burdens you\u2026 no, just no. I suspect telling her to move out will likely result in a breakup, but personally I would do it anyways. She sounds selfish and entitled, and you don\u2019t want to be with anyone who thinks it\u2019s okay to treat you like this.", "NTA. Dump her. She will be an albatross around your neck always!", "NTA\n\nGF needs a reality check. You work while going to school and make it work, right? There is no reason for her to not do so either.\n\nA friend of mine was in med school abroad and still worked to afford his life instead of leaching.\n\nI worked full time while studying AI, which is literally the toughest subject in my country.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for her to not work and her basically telling you to man up an work so she can go smooth sailing doesn\u2019t sit right with me. \n\nI would personally try to talk to her about it again and argue that it\u2019s absolutely unfair and not an option for you to shoulder everything and depending on the outcome of that conversation I would decide on whether or not to break up. This should be an absolute deal breaker to anyone.", "Run, run fast, run far!!!  She is using you to support her and you will be thrown away once she is done with school.  Have her move out and see how long the relationship lasts.  NTA", "NTA. Why should you get a second job because she wants to quit hers, why does she think it's ok to expect you to support her financially?\n\nShe would be getting at easy ride at your expense, which would lead to your school work suffering.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to pay for everything. She could go to school part time and work. She could take out loans (yeah it would suck but sometimes it\u2019s necessary).", "It's not right.  I'm stunned by how many of these posts are about people expecting other people so financially support them because of decisions they make, especialy whey they are perfectily capable of working themselves.  KICK HER OUT and find someone who treats you as an equal and not a potential wallet.", "NTA \n\nTell her to go live off of someone else. So YOU are supposed to work more and harder for HER future?!? Fuck that. She\u2019s using you and if she needs support tell her to call her parents!", "It\u2019s her right to not have to work while she goes to school so long as her bills get paid. She doesn\u2019t want to work? Ok. She can get student loans to pay the rent. \n\nDon\u2019t let her use you to pay her bills.", "NTA. One partner supporting the other while in school is definitely a thing. But it's also a *mutual* decision, not something in partner springs on the oher because it's expected. It also comes with risks, not to mention often not being a fun arrangement (but with the goal for future payoff). It's reasonable to not be okay with the arrangement in general or not okay with it in this particular life circumstance (young age, young relationship, unmarried, etc). Don't be guilted into taking on extra responsibilities that you're not fully on board with. You're under no obligation to be the sole provider for the household.", "NTA. The audacity.", "NTA. She may be confusing you with her parents. She may be telling you she wants to be a sugar baby. Either way she is entitled AF. Tell her goodbye.", "NTA; she may be you \u201cgirlfriend\u201d but she\u2019s not someone who cares about your well-being.  Let her go so she can become someone else\u2019s parasite.  Take care of yourself first and foremost.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t married so why is there an expectation that you support her. Hold old is she? Can she stay with parents or dorm?", "NTA\n\nYou're being used. Plain and simple.\n\nSo she decided, without even interacting with you, to quit her job and focus on school. When confronted about this she guilt trips you on the basis of \"sensitivity\" whilst she's ignoring the fact that you go to school as well, and she has the gall to tell you to get a second job? Why should you? You're clearly living within your own means, but she isn't. She's using you as a cash cow to float her lifestyle.", "NTA- she seems like the kinda girl to NOT stick around when things get tough financially. If she\u2019s just EXPECTING you to do all that. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d dump her, she is not a lifetime partner\u2026", "NTA. Not a chance.", "NTA\n\nShe obviously thinks that she has you hooked now & can make you do anything she wants.  She is telling you to get a second job so she can have it easy?  She is only interested in you for resources.  This is not a good relationship for you.", "why dont you get 3 jobs NTA", "nta - its not right she founda way to use you so she can get ahead.  ask her to move out and find another way to support herself.  your not married so there should be no expectation that you support her life", "NTA. \n\nIf she was living in her own, she'd have to figure out a way to make it work anyway. However, the fact that she thinks this is okay is a huge red flag.\nShe is prioritizing her own life over yours, and that's just not a healthy relationship. You are way too young to even consider staying with her.", "NTA. Gf is selfish as f*ck to expect you to get another job to totally support her so she can just focus on school. Just. No. It would mean you giving up your studies. Is there a guarantee that she will stay with you after she graduates, leaving you with no degree? She\u2019s a leech and you would be a fool to do as she says.", "Oooh the entitlement is high with this one! Run OP, RUN.
