NTA", "Lowkey sounds like shes on almost opposite of incel tiktok with girls that preach how women are worthy of everything and men need to serve them", "I'm married and briefly considered going back to school for a master's degree in a different field. My husband works for the university, so tuition would be cheaper for me. But it would probably mean working part time, and we discussed that it wasn't enough of a guarantee of getting a better job to have a lower income for that long. We'd also owe taxes on the discounted tuition, and that makes it not worth it. But the thing is that we're married and discussed it. Your GF sounds like someone who isn't ready to grow up.", "I think it's very disrespectful that she didn't even talk to you about any of this beforehand..... Can you imagine if you did this to her. Of course you can't men doing that today girlfriends is a guaranteed way to get dumped", "U don't really understand how is that right bcuz it's NOT right!! Okey\nThis relationship doesn't relove around her i'am girls girl but for real what is this?\nTaking a second job and droping out of school is not supporting her it's breaking urself for her to be a pillow princess to focus in her studies\nI'am a law student and i work at the same and the idea to ask my man to fill up his life with work and work and more work  for my sake never crossed my mind", "Oh so all that matters is her goals and you are to bend over backwards to support her. Sounds like she\u2019s got some serious princess syndrome.", "To the curb with her!\nKick it!", "Did you ask her to move out already or you want to ask? That pretty much a declaration of breaking up. Can\u2019t see how you can be together after that.", "Dump her quickly.  Dependauponus rex", "I wouldn\u2019t just ask her to move out, I\u2019d break up with her. NTA.", "NTA run, run fast and far she is not a Partner", "NTA. She is selfish and entitled.  There is better women out there", "This is a clear message to you: you do not matter as much as she does. \n\nYour girlfriend is selfish. Kick her out.\n\nNTA", "I hear stories like this all the time.  Sometimes about men, sometimes about women.  What the hell these people think they are bringing to the table to expect someone else to work two jobs do they can \"focus\" on some shit.", "NTA - if she is expecting you to support her financially, that significantly impacts you. You get a say in this. It\u2019s arrogant for her to assume.", "Why is everyone on Reddit so quick to say break up with them? They've been together for 3 years. Is the gf the AH? Yes. But does that mean OP should forgo any hope of salvaging the relationship? Of course not. The gf could have communicated better, yes. But OP could still take the opportunity to discuss a plan with her instead of just breaking up with her. If this is how you treat all of your relationships, where one fight means you cut all contact with them, then you must be one incredibly sad person.", "That's what I thought too. He will bankroll her education and she will leave him when she finds a nice job and doesn't need him anymore.", "This actually happens a lot. My husband expressed concerns about this when I went back to school for my Masters degree (part time; I was still working full time).\n\nThought had never crossed my mind. And of course I did NOT leave him when I graduated 4 years ago. Though I did my best not to be dismissive about his concerns and reassure him.", "Dude, the girl told OP to get a second job so that she doesn\u2019t have to work anymore. No discussion really from the sound of it. She just \u201creally needs the support right now\u201d so he should just work more and pay all the rent so she can focus on school. Who cares about his classes. \n\nThat\u2019s not a relationship. That\u2019s one person using another person and treating them like a meal ticket. He should break up with her ASAP.", "Yeah no. Some single disagreements merit a break up. This is one of them.", "You break up not break up doesn't matter but you are completely NTA and please don't sacrifice your education for anyone. It's about your long term life OP. Please don't change your plans who for sure isn't showing consideration for you.", "Exactly. This is an incredibly unfair ask.", "\u201cShe's clearly telegraphing to you that she wants to start her slide into being financially supported by a man rather than working.\u201d\n\nDing ding ding! We have a winner!", "> I mean you don't have to work if you have assets to fund your life.\n\nThat\u2019s what the comment you misread just said.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA: You should not sacrifice your future for someone else. You are not married and do not owe her anything other than emotional support.", "NTA, she clearly is only concerned for herself. Move on.", "Exactly. This is an incredibly unfair ask.", "nta", "Or, and hear me out, he can sit her down, discuss why he didn't like her idea, and try to communicate some sort of compromise. If they can't reach one and the gf is dead set on this, then by all means, break up. But don't just jump the gun and say break up. A lot of the posts on here could be solved with just healthy communication instead of just making assumptions.", "Yes, while there are instances of where a single argument could lead to a break up, this isn't one of them. Let me be clear, OP is NTA in this case. However, that doesn't mean that the default is to break up. You talk things out and go see a couple's therapist if you feel like you can't communicate on your own. The way I see it, unless that argument completely alters the way you look at them, to the point they seem like a completely different person, someone you *don't* want to spend the rest of your life with, then just take a minute and calm down. Once you're in a much better head space and no longer in the heat of the moment, reevaluate if you truly want to leave the relationship or if you were just angry.", "What the AF?! OP's gf had taken the Reddit cake for today!", "That\u2019s been common in most places with a decent welfare state, and it\u2019s a basic right that anyone should have anywhere. It\u2019s barbaric to restrict people\u2019s access to education on the basis of wealth.", "Run, run fast, run far!!! She is using you to support her and you will be thrown away once she is done with school. Have her move out and see how long the relationship lasts. NTA", "Faster."]}
