Not only do you not know his roommates from Shannon down the hall, but we don't all always get to do everything we want to do. I want to spend a year traveling, but I can't afford it so I go to work every day instead. If your son cannot afford the lifestyle he wants to live then he needs to choose a different lifestyle. It's not your responsibility to provide it to him.", "NTA . If he wants to be independent he also has to be responsible for himself. You offered to help in the best way possible if he wants something different he needs to figure it out another way.", "NTA, maybe if it was just him and you had good reasons to expect him to not actually need help with payments. I get the position he is in, my parents signed as guaranteer for me after uni and if you don\u2019t have a good salary or rental history a lot of places require it.\n\nBut there are two other roommates involved, I wouldn\u2019t touch that", "NTA for not being the guarantor.

You both have good reasons for your actions. I'm not sure how he'll get any housing without income or a co-signer. I'm not sure why staying in-state was so important to you if you have the means to help him where he is. Wouldn't he have needed housing anywhere other than your town, anyway? Not that you're obligated to help!\n\nCan't your wife co-sign for him herself?", "NTA. You could compromise by becoming guarantor for your sons portion of the rent, only. I know it's possible because a friend's daughter has a roommate and my friend is guarantor only for her daughter's portion of the rent. \n\nIf your son's friends don't have anyone to act as guarantor then he needs to find other roommates.", "NTA - post grads should be smart enough to work out how to fund thir desires themselvrs. His lack of work and presumptions do not constitute an obligation for you to keep forking out money for an independent adult - let alone be potentially on the hook for the other 3 if they fail to pay their share.", "ESH. Did you educate him about financial literacy? Did you prepare him for living independently?

He can figure it out by living somewhere affordable and working alongside to pay rent, apply to scholarships and bursaries, or he can live at home and study locally. \n\nHe needs to figure it out.

Where are their parents in this?  How is your son going to pay his portion of rent?  Is your son renting a room, and has his own lease, or will one of the others defaulting affect all three?   \n    \nBut no way are you an AH for not being a guarantor for all three people.", "NTA. Your son wants to be an independent adult, he might as well start now by living within his means and not relying on other people to provide a safety net. Don't be a guarantor for three people, that's a huge risk and not worth taking.", "NTA. Independence costs", "NTA that would have been a poor decision. Your wife is probably looking at it from an emotional, this is our child perspective rather than the real risk that you would be on the hook for the money if and when things don\u2019t go well. You were willing to help him with reasonable boundaries and he turned it down. Never co-sign for anything, for anyone. It\u2019s just not a good idea.", "NTA. And that's coming from someone who needed a parent to be her guarantor in order to find housing during graduate school. I knew it was a big ask and I am SO grateful my mom did me that huge favor. It never ended up costing her a dime, but I know she had no obligation to take on that risk for me (and two roommates who were basically strangers even to me at the time). I don't know where I would have lived if she'd said no, but I sure wouldn't have been MAD at her.", "Gosh, NTA. But do remember, he\u2019s probably learned your lesson about karma, and he\u2019s probably going to choose your nursing home. Good luck with that.", "This is also my opinion too. NTA\nYour son must not understand the risk he is asking you to take. That is just too big a liability for strangers you don't know. I would give him the chance to have a calm adult conversation about the risks involved and his personal choices and what the consequences of them might be. Keep yourself easy going in the conversation. He might be in college but he is still just a baby adult.\n\nBest advice? He needs to watch a whole season of Judge Judy and then come back to you! \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No doubt about that. He thinks that his life has many options that I am obligated to fund", "The management will not allow me to guarantee only his portion of the rent.", "The rent is more than the in state tuition. He also came up with the plan without consulting me or his mom regarding the financial details.", "While it may sometimes be possible, most leases have joint and several liability, which means all the tenants are individually and collectively responsible for the full amount of the rent, in which case OP being a guarantor for his son only wouldn\u2019t fly.", "Actually I really like Judge Brown more.", "A very common opinion among youth these days.", "Then you are out.  That is a bad situation for a student to get into anyway, most college towns have plenty of lease by the room options, that is what your son should look to.", "These are useful details for your post. Suggest editing it. \n\nIf you were gonna help with in state tuition why not help as much as you would have and he has to meet the rest?", "He applied to a school and got accepted without you being involved with FAFSA forms and such?", "Wonder where youth get that impression?", "I\u2019m reading it as the grad school is out of state", "NTA he'll understand one of these days...", "NTA\n\nDon't do it.\n\nHe knows his options.", "He's paying tuition for grad school?   Then for most majors, he's an idiot.\n\nAt many schools, you can get most of the tuition waived by being a research or teaching assistant.   I only paid $200/semester not that long ago.  Many programs also offer living stipends.   It wasn't great money.  But I could rent a shitty apartment and feed myself, if I behaved sensibly\n\nNta", "YTA for trying to exert control on your son\u2019s life choices by dangling your financial support over his head. Sure, you shouldn\u2019t be the guarantor for his roommates, but why can you *only* financially support him if he goes to a state school? It sounds like you\u2019re resentful of him for moving far away from home and you wish he was closer so you could have more influence and control over him. If you\u2019re appreciative of his ambitions, show it to him by offering the financial support you\u2019re capable of providing.", "NtA.  You have to knock em out of the nest or they won't fly.  Occasionally helping w rent is ok but no font do it if you don't want to.", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. It's one thing to maybe co-sign for your son only on an apartment he already knows he can budget for. Signing for 3 people, 2 of whom seem to be strangers to you while your son doesn't even have a job is literally signing up for disaster.", "Edit: NTA, OPs son is asking to guarantee 42,000 in rent. The son can find cheaper housing that doesn't need a guarantor or they are wasting their time and money getting a masters degree in NYC. \n\nOriginal Comment:\nI N F O: What state are you in and where is he planning on attending school and what is the program? This would help to characterize the reasonability of his actions because it could be anything from he traveled from Massachusetts to Mississippi to study museum studies to him going from Idaho to California to study chemical engineering.\n\nI'm leaning towards N A H though as your refusal to guarantee a rental for 3 people is very reasonable but he may be justifiably annoyed as he might not be able to find good housing without a guarantor.", "NTA  He wants to experience life he can figure it out on his own seeing that he is all GROWED up", "NTA. I bet if you ask about the other roommates, their parents wouldnt do it either!", "NTA well your son is experiencing life. I could see you giving him something towards the rent but guarantee in the whole thing puts you on the hook for the room mates too and there's no reason to do that.", "Man, I lived at home and worked 30 hours a week to pay for my college. The only help my parents gave me was signing onto a couple of those Pell grants. I'll never understand when kids have the audacity to question whatever assistance their parents offer, let alone for graduate school. You're nta. It's time for your kid to spread his own wings.", "NTA.  I\u2019m not sure that I would do if for my own kid, but I definitely would not do it for anyone else.", "Why should you be the guarantor for his roommates, two strangers?\n\nWhy don't those room mates ask their parents to be the guarantor?\n\nNTA", "NTA that's an unreasonable ask", "NTA for sure.  We just signed on as guarantor on my college aged daughter's apartment last month.  But we are only guarantors on HERS.  I don't know those other kids and how responsible they may or may not be.  Sorry, buddy, but I'm not risking my financial wellbeing on them.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost parents love their kids and do it.

Not a chance. No way.", ">\" He can get a job and everyone can pay their own rent! NTA.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes not work that way ... He needs it NOT because he can not pay, but because he has no payment history.", "If his wife does this it will likely impact him financially as well.  That's not a great option.", "It's more complicated than that. I have offered to help if he rents a room within someone's house, but he wants the amenities of a corporate apartment where he must have roommates.", "Luckily for me, I have enough saved where I won't be needing his input for my nursing home", "I would prefer not to state the specific info as the wife is on Reddit. Put it this way, the three bedroom apartment will cost $3500 a month. Crazy!", "That was my experience too. I never would have dared to even think of asking my parents for such help. Of course my wife thinks otherwise because we are now in a better financial situation in comparison to my parents.", "I predict you will be lonely there, even with your millions.", "That means NYC. If it isn't, your son can find cheaper housing. The next highest cost of living cities, SF and Boston, you can find 3 bedrooms for less than $2500.", "Remember that college costs have ballooned since you went to college. I had professors complain that students at my college kept whining about tuition instead of getting a summer job. I'd like to see the summer job that pays $50,000+ in tuition plus living expenses for a year!\n\nI don't understand why he's in this position in graduate school, though. Surely there are apartments somewhere in the area that will accept loans in substitute for income without a cosigner?", "I offered to help with in state public school tuition if he lives at home, but he wants private school in addition to helping him out with his rent in an expensive metro area.", "Even in NYC, son doesn't NEED to live in Manhattan.", "Correct. West Coast to east coast.", "Yea, but even if it's 4x the price, it sounds like \"you're not taking my advice, so I won't help at all\"  \n\n\nI misread and thought it was undergrad, though. Grad school is different. \n\n\nI wonder if OP spent undergrad living at home and really just wants to get out. \n\n\nDefinitely shouldn't be a guarantor. I just think OP should give his son however much he would have been willing to pay for in state."]}
