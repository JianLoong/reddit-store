We talked about masters degree and I said, he would have to pay for that on his own nickel and he would be wiser to get experience first and get his company to pay for his masters.  At one point while he was in college, he talked about law school.

He will never become self sufficient if dad keeps bailing him out.  He is an adult now, and he needs a financial plan.
