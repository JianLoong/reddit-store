NTA.", "NTA to the extreme. \n\nHe\u2019s chasing postgrad degrees, unemployed, and obviously looking for the Bank of Dad to fund his life.", "NTA\n\nBeing guarantor for three people is insane!", "NTA. Not only do you not know his roommates from Shannon down the hall, but we don't all always get to do everything we want to do. I want to spend a year traveling, but I can't afford it so I go to work every day instead. If your son cannot afford the lifestyle he wants to live then he needs to choose a different lifestyle. It's not your responsibility to provide it to him.", "NTA . If he wants to be independent he also has to be responsible for himself. You offered to help in the best way possible if he wants something different he needs to figure it out another way.", "NTA, maybe if it was just him and you had good reasons to expect him to not actually need help with payments. I get the position he is in, my parents signed as guaranteer for me after uni and if you don\u2019t have a good salary or rental history a lot of places require it.\n\nBut there are two other roommates involved, I wouldn\u2019t touch that", "NTA for not being the guarantor. But you sound like you're not helping him financially otherwise just to spite him. Can you pay the amount of money you would have paid if he had stayed in state?", "NAH. You both have good reasons for your actions. I'm not sure how he'll get any housing without income or a co-signer. I'm not sure why staying in-state was so important to you if you have the means to help him where he is. Wouldn't he have needed housing anywhere other than your town, anyway? Not that you're obligated to help!\n\nCan't your wife co-sign for him herself?", "NTA. You could compromise by becoming guarantor for your sons portion of the rent, only. I know it's possible because a friend's daughter has a roommate and my friend is guarantor only for her daughter's portion of the rent. \n\nIf your son's friends don't have anyone to act as guarantor then he needs to find other roommates.", "NTA - post grads should be smart enough to work out how to fund thir desires themselvrs. His lack of work and presumptions do not constitute an obligation for you to keep forking out money for an independent adult - let alone be potentially on the hook for the other 3 if they fail to pay their share.", "ESH. Did you educate him about financial literacy? Did you prepare him for living independently? Did you make your terms of support clear up front (it sounds like you have him advice but you didn\u2019t say you told him you wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t help him other than in kind.)\n\nHe has pursued his education. He has graduated. He can figure it out by living somewhere affordable and working alongside to pay rent, apply to scholarships and bursaries, or he can live at home and study locally. \n\nHe needs to figure it out. This is sort of being grown and deciding between education and work options. It is (unfortunately) a privilege to attend graduate school.", "NTA.  Your son wants you to be on the hook for 3 people.  If one of them dips out you're responsible for paying their rent too.  I'd rather not get my credit score hit hard because of that.\n\nAlso do these roommates even exist?  Is your son just trying to force you to pay for a nice roomy apartment?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Where are their parents in this?  How is your son going to pay his portion of rent?  Is your son renting a room, and has his own lease, or will one of the others defaulting affect all three?   \n    \nBut no way are you an AH for not being a guarantor for all three people.", "NTA. Your son wants to be an independent adult, he might as well start now by living within his means and not relying on other people to provide a safety net. Don't be a guarantor for three people, that's a huge risk and not worth taking.", "NTA. Independence costs", "NTA that would have been a poor decision. Your wife is probably looking at it from an emotional, this is our child perspective rather than the real risk that you would be on the hook for the money if and when things don\u2019t go well. You were willing to help him with reasonable boundaries and he turned it down. Never co-sign for anything, for anyone. It\u2019s just not a good idea.", "NTA. And that's coming from someone who needed a parent to be her guarantor in order to find housing during graduate school. I knew it was a big ask and I am SO grateful my mom did me that huge favor. It never ended up costing her a dime, but I know she had no obligation to take on that risk for me (and two roommates who were basically strangers even to me at the time). I don't know where I would have lived if she'd said no, but I sure wouldn't have been MAD at her.", "Gosh, NTA. But do remember, he\u2019s probably learned your lesson about karma, and he\u2019s probably going to choose your nursing home. Good luck with that.", "This is also my opinion too. NTA\nYour son must not understand the risk he is asking you to take. That is just too big a liability for strangers you don't know. I would give him the chance to have a calm adult conversation about the risks involved and his personal choices and what the consequences of them might be. Keep yourself easy going in the conversation. He might be in college but he is still just a baby adult.\n\nBest advice? He needs to watch a whole season of Judge Judy and then come back to you! \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No doubt about that. He thinks that his life has many options that I am obligated to fund", "The management will not allow me to guarantee only his portion of the rent.", "The rent is more than the in state tuition. He also came up with the plan without consulting me or his mom regarding the financial details.", "While it may sometimes be possible, most leases have joint and several liability, which means all the tenants are individually and collectively responsible for the full amount of the rent, in which case OP being a guarantor for his son only wouldn\u2019t fly.", "Actually I really like Judge Brown more.", "A very common opinion among youth these days.", "Then you are out.  That is a bad situation for a student to get into anyway, most college towns have plenty of lease by the room options, that is what your son should look to.", "These are useful details for your post. Suggest editing it. \n\nIf you were gonna help with in state tuition why not help as much as you would have and he has to meet the rest?", "He applied to a school and got accepted without you being involved with FAFSA forms and such?", "Wonder where youth get that impression?", "I\u2019m reading it as the grad school is out of state"]}
