We are currently 16 weeks pregnant with our first (and probably last) baby. Our miracle baby. Her hormones have been off the charts, as to be expected, as this pregnancy has been difficult for her. \n\nTo cut to the issue: since my wife has become pregnant my dog has become a whine ass, to put it bluntly. The vet states it's just the dogs way of expressing concern for my wife and that she now has anxiety; more than likely caused by my wife's difficulty and emotions. Recently I started referring to my dog has \"pupperino\" whenever she starts whining. Ex: \"what's wrong pupperino\". The first few times I said this, my wife just went quiet and removed herself from the room. But recently, when I called my wife the nickname I had given her 12 years ago, she told me to never call her that again (Baberino). When I asked why, she said I tainted the nickname for her and she never wants to be called something that is that closely similar to what I've been calling my dog. I admittedly don't see what the issue is but with that said, my buddy is on my wife's side and said that since I knew my wife's hormones and depression was in full spike, calling my dog a nickname that was so closely similar to that of which I've been calling my wife for years is basically disrespectful. AITA?\n\nETA: my wife absolutely loved her nickname but now it truly bothers her when I call her baberino because I now call the dog pupperino. She is admittedly completely fed up with my dogs behaviors (the whining and anxiety, which causes her to be underfoot 24/7 now) so I can see why it would bother her but I admittedly still don't see the issue.", "created_utc": 1680272258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127mwrw/aita_for_giving_my_wife_and_dog_similar_nicknames/", "score": 414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter whether you agree with her reasoning--that Baberino sounds too much like Pupperino--but it does matter that you respect her and not continue using a name she dislikes. Also, there's always the chance that after the baby has been delivered and the dog has settled, your wife might return to liking the nickname. But until/if that time ever comes, don't use Baberino.", "YTA\n\nI mean, you were not necessarily an asshole for giving the dog the nickname in the first place. You didn't know it would upset your wife. But now that you know that it does, why the heck are you *arguing* about it?", "As long as you stop calling her something she doesnt wanna be called everything should be fine, right??", "NAH.  You didn't do anything intentionally, but she doesn't like the association, so she made her thoughts known.  If you're smart, you won't use either in the future.", "YTA - not because you innocently chose that as the dog\u2019s nickname, but because your wife is hormonal, stressed, and you\u2019re pooh-poohing her request that you stop. The message she\u2019s sending to you (that you don\u2019t seem to be receiving) is that you\u2019re hurting her - why would you want to keep doing that? Please just honour her request, and hopefully, when things settle down, you\u2019ll be able to resume using the name. Don\u2019t push her to a place where she starts hating you and the dog.", "You don't need to understand to cooperate. It's not a big ask to stop using the nickname. YTA if you don't cut it out.", "Umm... I've been pregnant and exceptionally hormonal. My thought process made no logical sense and I couldn't control it. I'm going to go with a soft YTA. \n\nIn the end it doesn't really matter if it makes sense to you because it does to your wife. I would suggest coming up with a different nickname for your wife that is cute and has nothing to do with her pregnancy. Definitely stop calling your dog pupperino. Come up with a different one for the dog too in order to remove the association completely from future conversations.", "NAH\n\nYou've only started calling your dog this since he started annoying you. I suspect your wife is wondering if you feel the same way about her. I realise that's a bit of a reach, but she is pregnant and probably a bit sensitive.\n\nIts not a big ask to not use a nickname so I could respect her wishes if I were you.", "YTA, gently. I believe the reason why you\u2019re wife is bothered by this is that you only started calling the dog by that nickname after it became a nuisance to you. The message she might be receiving is that you associate \u201cerino\u201d with something annoying and hard to deal with - which in this case started with her. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s logical, but I can see that being her line of thought. \u201cWhy is he referring to something that is bothering us with a nickname so close to mine? Is it because he believes I\u2019m also bothersome?\u201d. \n\nShe\u2019s also pregnant and requested something simple out of you. Doesn\u2019t cost much to abide.", "NTA - But maybe stop adding erino to the end of words and using that nickname for the duration of the pregnancy, if you really wish to revisit the topic after baby is born go for it carefully. No matter how unreasonable the request may be, anything you can do for your wife right now you should do, this damn sure isn't a hill worth dying on Redditorrino.", "I\u2019m giving you a very gentle YTA. It seems like you didn\u2019t mean any harm. But, given the circumstances, you should just listen to your wife and stop calling her and the dog by your nicknames. This can be revisited in a year when she isn\u2019t pregnant and her hormones aren\u2019t all over the place.", "Why would you WANT to use any pet name that your partner doesn't like? That defeats the whole point of the pet name. It's supposed to be endearing and make them feel loved.\n\nThe whole dog thing has nothing to do with it. She told you she doesn't like it, so knock it off. That's all there is to it.", "NTA for calling your dog pupperino.  However, you will be TA if you disregard your wife's wishes on this.  Unfortunately, you need to at least temporarily shelve her nickname.  In the future you may be able to dust it off, you may not.", "YTA.  First of all, listen to your buddy.  He\u2019s spot on.  Second of all, your wife is fed up with the dogs and now every time you call her by that nickname she is reminded of them.  Apologize and come up with a new, better nickname for your wife.", "Are you Italian by any chance??? Just asking!\n\nNAH... NTA", "NTA but its a super minor thing. Your wife is clearly going through it, and dogs can be a lot, I imagine it's only worse now that she's pregnant. \n\nCan you get the dog out of the house for a bit? Have a family member come walk the dog for you a few times a day, or someone come for a few hours a week and just take them to a park or something? It seems like everybody here is feeling the pressure of pregnancy, human and dog lol.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think you meant any disrespect to your wife by calling your dog pupperino.  It\u2019s just an affectionate nickname, that\u2019s similar to a nickname you have for someone that you also love and care for.  But I do think you should stop if this is bothering your wife this much, not really a hill you should die on especially when she is pregnant and her hormones are going to be crazy", "NAH - it's a harmless nickname and your wife is going through a lot. Neither of you are AH's but just let it go, she's going to feel a lot and project a lot onto random things over the next year.", "NTA, but your wife is pregnant and struggling. Just say \"yes, dear\" and adjust your behavior. If it's a real issue for you talk about it after the baby's born, or maybe after the child starts school, or maybe when they're off to college, or after their wedding, or after the grandchild is born, or maybe never. \n\nMy dad almost never gave advice, but just before my wedding, he said, \"whenever you feel like saying something, think twice, then shut up.\" It was a tongue  in cheek comment, but it's been helpful more than I thought it would be", "YTA for continuing to use the nickname after she told you she doesn\u2019t like it anymore now. If you had stopped once she told you to it would have been fine, but continuing makes you an AH.", "NAH-  Shes going through a lot right now and has every right to ask you not to call her something, and you had no way of knowing this would upset her because it hasnt in the past. Neither of you are wrong or bad or unreasonable for it. Just take her wishes into account and move forward", "NTA, just incredibly uncreative.", "YTA. Stop calling the dog that. Give him a new nickname. And shift back to your wife\u2019s nickname if she still likes it.", "NTA - She'll get over it. She's hormonal because she's pregnant. My sister once got emotional over a Fiji water bottle she left at my apartment that I threw out, but I saved it for her because she called me before I took out my trash. It was asinine, but it meant something to her. Just you know, be a little more aware of her hormones. She's not in a normal state of mind.", "NTA\n\nSo she's not mad at your name, she doesn't like the dog. I talk to her about that part.", "Yta for blaming how she feels on hormones", "NTA for now, but you will be if you continue calling her that nickname.\n\nEven if you don't understand it, she obviously feels hurt by that, so much so that she expressly told you so, and that should be enough. You don't need to understand her reasoning, you just need to understand that it makes her feel bad, and as I presume you care about that, that should be sufficient.", "NAH I guess\n\nIt's a silly complaint in my eyes, and I can't fathom how the dog getting a pretty common nickname for a dog (seriously, I've heard \"pupperino\" so many times) somehow taints or degrades your wife's previously established nickname. But whatever, she's allowed to feel that way (especially while in pain and hormonal). So just stop calling her that now if that's her preference, and you're both in the green.", "Lmao. NTA I call my cat everything I call my fiance.. I love them both so much and they are just cute nick names", "NTA, I love adding \"erino\" at the end of words too I think it's hilarious. I really don't get what the issue is", "NTA.\n\nThat might be the most irrational thing I've ever heard.\n\nYou should go around referring to everyone as an -ino. \n\nTalking to your boss - \"Hey there, how's it going bosserino?\"\n\nTalking to your grandfather - \"Oh hey, what's going on Gramperino?\"", "NTA It's just a suffix, I have literally dozens of friends whose nicknames are just \"random thing  with \"ey\"\" on the end", "NTA.  Both are cute, and your wife needs to take a deep breath.  The names are very similar, but they aren't identical.  Pregnancy isn't an excuse to lose your mind over every little thing.", "YTA. Also, you need to get that dog more exercise before it drives your wife crazy and stresses your marriage. I used to need to do about a half hour of fetch twice a day, minimum, with my dog, or he was a needy nightmare. Find a way to help the dog run off energy a couple times a day. And stop calling it Pupperino, your wife is going to wince every time she hears it", "YTA dude!", "NTA.  The baby can be baberino going forward.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All the people saying \u201cy t a for continuing to use it after she asked/y t a for being confused by this request\u201d need to get real. Your wife is in fact being a little hormonal and sensitive, as is her right while creating life. In your situation I\u2019d also have a bit of an eyebrow raise over this, doesn\u2019t make you an ah.

I mean if you continued to call her that during her pregnancy when she asked you not to, that would be a dick move, but you\u2019re definitely not an asshole simply for calling your dog \u201cpupperino\u201d. You couldn\u2019t have predicted that she would react negatively to that. If my bf called our dog a nickname similar to a nickname he calls me, I would just think it\u2019s cute.", "INfO: are you still calling the dog Puperino?", "You've had the dog for two years, but didnt start calling it pupperino untill it became a whine ass with anxiety, and you refer to it by that nickname when its whining and being annoying.\n\nI dont think you did it intentionally, but giving the dog a nickname close to the one you have for your wife only when the dog became a whiny little menace might be giving her some pause as well.\n\nInfo: Are you still using the nickname now knowing she doesnt like it?", "NTA as long as you stop calling her that for the time being as it\u2019s obviously triggering her a bit. Reality is that given time, a birth and some hormones settling down she might laugh about it and will love the nickname again and she will tell the story of how the dog was so involved in her pregnancy it wouldn\u2019t leave her side etc. even if she doesn\u2019t like it ever again (pregnancy does change you) then that\u2019s fine too. She is asking you to stop calling her something that is upsetting her, it doesn\u2019t have to make any sense to you but you should respect her enough not to do it. I had things that triggered me due to abuse when I was young and I don\u2019t tell many people about it but a small example is there is a certain way of having my hand held that I automatically pull away from as a base reaction. When I met my husband and before I told him I why I simply asked him not to do that because I don\u2019t like it and showed him how it felt comfortable for me to hold his hand. He didn\u2019t push as to why or say it was weird and if he did it accidentally (it\u2019s was a pretty innocuous movement) he would feel me tense and apologise and correct it. Later on I explained my history to him and it all made perfect sense but the point is I didn\u2019t have to give him a reason. Technically you didn\u2019t do anything wrong which is why I\u2019m going NTA but you have to realise that this period of time is all about your partner. She is going through something that most male brains cannot begin to comprehend. She is on edge and that puts the dog on edge and puts you on edge and everything seems huge right now. \nWhile I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong (unless you keep calling her it) even the fact that you are on here asking for validation shows how little you understand what she is going through, this is not an insult by the way, it\u2019s pretty normal in many men. Your mantra for the next few years is basically her body and mind need to become your priority because right now her body and mind belong to someone else, the baby. You need to work to replace the piece of her that is being taken by the life she is creating as best you can. That is the best way you can support her and it means giving up a small part of yourself as a priority the same way that her body and brain are doing full time.\nThis is not even a big problem. Go buy her a pregnancy spa overnight stay and tell her you want her to have some time away from the dog and some special time and remind her you love her and avoid any kind of \u2018ino\u2019 endings when reverting to her and things will be fine.", "OP, YTA for taking issue with your wife's upset. Just drop her nickname for now until she settles down.", "My dog went through the exact same thing when I was pregnant- she whined and kept me up and night and pawed at me and I knew it was because of the baby, and honestly I didn't like her at all during that time - it might have been that she became a brat at it might have been pregnancy pet aversion (Which I did not know was a real thing at the time).  I didn't want to tell anyone I didn't like my dog because I didn't want to sound like a monster - but I didn't like her.  If my husband started calling her by an offshoot of a beloved pet name I probably wouldn't have been thrilled.  \n\nYour wife probably doesn't like the dog much right now - the dog is stressing her out and she doesn't need the stress and sometimes watching someone be sweet or nice to whatever or whoever is annoying you just grates.  Not the OP's fault - but something he should keep in mind.  Not a bad idea to read up on pregnancy pet aversion. \n\nThe OP should see about coming up with a new sweet nickname for his wife - she probably needs some extra love and affection right now.", "So wait, you judge y-t-a and then your first complete sentence is to say NTA is actually the right judgement for the question he asked.

No, that reason is silly.", "YTA \n\nThe issue is that your wife hates it. \n\nThat's all you need to know to stop assy behavior.\n\nI was gonna go NAH until you got to the part where your wife has to justify her feelings to you.\n\nThat is asshole behavior whether she is hormonal or not. Seriously. \n\nYou should take several steps back and examine that shit.", "Do you not see how amazing she is!? She is in the process of bestowing the gift of life on your miracle baby! Cut her a break and just do whatever will make her feel better. Seriously, SHE\u2019S GROWING A PERSON INSIDE OF HER!!

If SHE doesn\u2019t like being called baberino anymore then don\u2019t call her that. If she doesn\u2019t like you calling the dog pupperino because it\u2019s too close to her beloved nickname then stop. It\u2019s very simple: even if you think she\u2019s wrong, even if she is wrong, just go with it and apologize for upsetting her because you love her and her happiness matters more than this.

Dont make her feel guilty. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t like her reason. Just apologize to your pregnant wife and adjust your actions accordingly.

How were you to know that an innocent nickname would bother your wife so much? A lot of people in the comments are saying things like \"you know it bothered her, so you're the AH for continuing to call her that\", but I have read your post a couple of times, and I'm not seeing that happening. You WOULD be the AH if she told you that she didn't like it and you kept doing it. But simply not understanding why she's upset doesn't make you an AH.

You can only apologise and say it didn't occur to you and you won't do it again.", "Absolutely NAH. \n\nIf you purposely continue it in order to antagonise, then sure. But sounds like you just used what you thought to be a playful nickname and your wife took issue likely because of hormones.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s not her fault. Just take onboard her dislike of the usage and don\u2019t use it anymore.", "I think it\u2019s really cute and would love that but if she doesn\u2019t and she\u2019s hormonal and emotional make some good eye contact and let her know you love her so much it just came out when you were being lovey to the dog.", "Doesn't matter if you don't see it, don't do it", "Pick a different hill to die on, my friend.

Let it go. When a woman\u2019s pregnant especially with the first, just let it go. Getting a win will do nothing for you but letting your wife have her way will reduce her stress and help her overall health.  It\u2019s really not worth it to argue over something as silly as a nickname.", "YTA. Reading the first sentence of your situation, I realized immediately your dog comes first.\n\nThen, you gave your dog nearly the same name as your love! Waaaa!\n\nSo, you would hardly hardly have to even differentiate between the two.

I mean pupperino is fucking cute and whiney stressed out dogs deserve extra love and nicknames. \n\nI call my dog and human baby all the same nicknames. \n\nBut pregnant wives deserve as close to literally whatever they want as possible so I say hands up beg for forgiveness and figure out something adorable yet totally different to call the dog.", "You don't need to see the issue, you just need to respect your wife's feelings.

She'll probably feel silly about it later.

Cat?  Caterino. Kid?  Kiderino.

Baberino is a no go. Respect that. YTA.", "Well, like myself I imagine he simply cannot believe that she's upset about something that probably wouldn't hit the radar for a sane adult human. He probably is as genuinely confused as I am reading this.  OP is about to have 2 babies in the house.", "I\u2019m sorry, I think I might have missed something but OP still wants to call his wife Baberino?\n\nI thought he was only asking if he was an AH because he called her before he knew it bothered her and now had stopped.", "I get why the wife is upset. Now the INO is associated with being upset and whiny.

Does he think \\*I'm\\* needy and annoying?\" \n\nThat's not to say those were OP's intentions, but it's not a flattering comparison", ">We are currently 16 weeks pregnant\n\nYeah, I caught that.

You would feel empathy. I\u2019ve been through that myself. Having to talk to my older child and explain that mummy and daddy will always love her no matter how many brothers or sisters she had. She\u2019s our little girl and we will always love her and make time for her. \n\nBut a dog doesn\u2019t get that treatment. And shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a dog, you can\u2019t reason with it or explain that it\u2019s behaviour is wrong. The only option is to punish it when it acts out to teach it to stop. Possibly by removing it from the room, sending it to its bed or whatever else. \n\nAnd that isn\u2019t something people who treat their pets like children want to do."]}
