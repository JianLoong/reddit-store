{"id": 22731, "submission_id": "154q89l", "title": "AITA For not wanting to split my jackpot win with my husbands friend?", "selftext": "\n\nI (F30) played the lottery for the first time last year when everyone was talking about the Powerball jackpot.  Since then I\u2019ve played casually, only spending a few dollars a week. I occasionally won a few bucks and never really expected to win anything big but it was nice to dream as I had a ton of  debt and have been struggling a lot.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago (won\u2019t say the month for privacy) I checked the winning numbers one night against my ticket and it matched with my numbers perfectly. Initially I didn\u2019t believe it and thought there had to be a mistake so I told my husband(M35) and we checked it like a dozen times and I was right, we won. It\u2019s Life changing, multi generational, fuck you money. \n\nWe instantly agreed to keep the news to ourselves and wait a few months before we did anything. The past few months have been an incredible high, filled with disbelief and though it\u2019s been difficult, we have managed not to make any large purchases or change our lifestyle. We fantasized about what to do with our money but the time to claim is drawing near so we have begun having more practical discussions about how to claim it and what to do with it. \n\nWhile discussing, my husband \u201cAdam\u201d brought up that he thinks it\u2019ll be a good idea to split the money with his best friend/ business partner \u201cTim\u201d. Tim and Adam have been friends since they were in middle school and have done everything together ever since. Together they\u2019ve started businesses, work together, invested money, moved to the same town and have often dreamed about our families making it big together. Since we have take risks together and are so close, Adam feels it\u2019s fair to give them 1/3 of the cash prize so that 1) we are not going on this journey to a new life alone 2) it\u2019s suspicious to make all this money suddenly and more easily explained if Tim \u201cmakes\u201dmoney as well since we do everything together. \n\nI however feel it\u2019s risky to share that we have come into this money with them because Tim\u2019s family tends to be more flashy and like showing off and I don\u2019t fully trust that they will keep it quiet or modest enough to not raise suspicion. This is important because I\u2019ve seen community members harass and attack people with far less money just because they feel entitled. This could jeopardize our safety so I want to avoid it if at all possible. Also I\u2019m not really comfortable with his plan to add Tim and his wife as members of our LLC to claim the prize (because I think it could have them feel entitled to a bigger chunk or take the money?)\n\nAdam thinks I\u2019m being selfish and he wont enjoy our new found wealth if his friend isn\u2019t living the same lifestyle but I think we could find a way to later give them some money after figuring out a way to explain how we came into money without telling them we won lottery (no idea how to do that yet). \n\nAnyway, AITA for not wanting to tell them we won the lottery and split the money? Am I selfish?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your input. I think a few things are clear now to me. 1) absolutely a horrible idea to put Tim on the ticket. 2) Claim the money with only me as the beneficiary for now and change based on advice of lawyer. 3) Find a way to help Tim\u2019s family without blowing our cover. \nThanks again for all your input.", "created_utc": 1689857888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154q89l/aita_for_not_wanting_to_split_my_jackpot_win_with/", "score": 6864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since then I\u2019ve played casually, only spending a few dollars a week. I occasionally won a few bucks and never really expected to win anything big but it was nice to dream as I had a ton of  debt and have been struggling a lot.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago (won\u2019t say the month for privacy) I checked the winning numbers one night against my ticket and it matched with my numbers perfectly. Initially I didn\u2019t believe it and thought there had to be a mistake so I told my husband(M35) and we checked it like a dozen times and I was right, we won. It\u2019s Life changing, multi generational, fuck you money. \n\nWe instantly agreed to keep the news to ourselves and wait a few months before we did anything. The past few months have been an incredible high, filled with disbelief and though it\u2019s been difficult, we have managed not to make any large purchases or change our lifestyle. We fantasized about what to do with our money but the time to claim is drawing near so we have begun having more practical discussions about how to claim it and what to do with it. \n\nWhile discussing, my husband \u201cAdam\u201d brought up that he thinks it\u2019ll be a good idea to split the money with his best friend/ business partner \u201cTim\u201d. Tim and Adam have been friends since they were in middle school and have done everything together ever since. Together they\u2019ve started businesses, work together, invested money, moved to the same town and have often dreamed about our families making it big together. Since we have take risks together and are so close, Adam feels it\u2019s fair to give them 1/3 of the cash prize so that 1) we are not going on this journey to a new life alone 2) it\u2019s suspicious to make all this money suddenly and more easily explained if Tim \u201cmakes\u201dmoney as well since we do everything together. \n\nI however feel it\u2019s risky to share that we have come into this money with them because Tim\u2019s family tends to be more flashy and like showing off and I don\u2019t fully trust that they will keep it quiet or modest enough to not raise suspicion. This is important because I\u2019ve seen community members harass and attack people with far less money just because they feel entitled. This could jeopardize our safety so I want to avoid it if at all possible. Also I\u2019m not really comfortable with his plan to add Tim and his wife as members of our LLC to claim the prize (because I think it could have them feel entitled to a bigger chunk or take the money?)\n\nAdam thinks I\u2019m being selfish and he wont enjoy our new found wealth if his friend isn\u2019t living the same lifestyle but I think we could find a way to later give them some money after figuring out a way to explain how we came into money without telling them we won lottery (no idea how to do that yet). \n\nAnyway, AITA for not wanting to tell them we won the lottery and split the money? Am I selfish?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.

You may think it won\u2019t happen to you but neither did they.", "NTA. \n\nFirst thing - say nothing to anyone (especially this friend) until you have everything all done.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's your money. Personally, in my situation I'd say something like \"We can take care of him, and give him a gift, a substantial life changing one, but this is ours and ours alone to handle.\" \n\nIf this is a nine figure number, I have some concerns you might not fully be aware of the level of your needs now. I'm concerned you said LLC rather than trust, so I'm going to give you a few action items to read over. \n\nFirst, if you haven't already **DO NOT SIGN THE TICKET**\n\nOk - Go to a top tier BigLaw firm (I'm talking something on the level of Cravath, Sullivan & Cromwell, Davis Polk - the kind of firms that represent the upper 1% - which you are now a part of.) - ask to speak to a partner in their Trust and Estate Practice. These lawyers handle numbers this large, and plenty larger, and it is worth spending the money to make sure everything is done right. They'll handle the structuring of trusts, and LLCs to structure, and keep you protected. They can also create gift and charitable trusts, which you can use to gift your friend. \n\nSame thing for tracking the money and the taxes - go to a reputable accounting firm. Ask to speak to someone in Private Client Services. You don't need Big Four (I'd actually recommend against using them for something like this - they're generally more focused on Corporate, and you'd be shunted down to a low level associate). A mid tier firm (Top 50) should have the experienced staff there to help on the tax and money management side. They'll also be able to recommend reputable financial advisors. I can recommend some firms for you if you'd like to DM.\n\nAny financial advisor you hire - make sure they are a fiduciary, and bonded. They'll be bound to act in your best interests, and not to sell you things that are in theirs.\n\nAlso, personal security. First, you both need to change your phone numbers, email addresses, and delete your social media accounts. You are going to have all sorts of friends and family start coming out of nowhere, people you've never met, people you haven't spoken to in years, even people you know. Money does funny things to people. Any good lawyer should be able to point you in the right direction on what to do.\n\nFinally - do not start living large just because you have the money. There are far too many stories about people who win these huge jackpots ending up in bankruptcy. Money like this can sustain an outstanding lifestyle, but can be lost due to mismanagement, bad investments, overgenerosity, etc.  You may think you will never have to *work* again, but really managing this money is a full time job. You need to be aware of what is being done with it, you need to be vigilant with your expenses, and you need to harden yourself a bit.\n\nEdit - one last thing and do this **TODAY** Find a local bank branch (maybe one a few towns away where you are less likely to run into someone you know), that still offers safety deposit boxes, open one up, and bring it over there and lock it up until you find a lawyer that will then give you next steps.", "NTA but you better become one really fast before you end up a broke statistic.

If you live in a community property state your husband is entitled to 1/2 the winnings. If he wants to give him 1/2 of his money that\u2019s great but he shouldn\u2019t expect you to pay for everything you guys had planned from your half.", "OP, giving any money away to anyone right now is a very bad idea.  Once you see a financial planner, you will realize there huge tax implications.  Also you need a full understanding of the time value of money, investments, compound interest and creating generational wealth.\n\nThere are a number of ways to set up trusts that allow Tim and selected family/friends to enjoy some income from the money/investments without giving it away outright.  As discussed, more often than not, lottery winners and their families come to grief because of poor financial decisions.  \n\nPlease consult with several financial planners and attorneys familiar with lottery or other significant windfalls.  Select the ones who explain things best.  They can help you make the best decisions with this money to create generational wealth and meet your goals of family/friends assistance and charitable goals.\n\nFinally, it might be worthwhile to get some psychological counseling about this - winning this money creates such a seismic life change for you and husband, it can be hard on a marriage.  I\u2019m sure you are aware of the statistics for lottery winners.  Transitioning to a lifestyle of wealth when you are unfamiliar with it has many potential problems, that a counselor can help you navigate to build on your marriage and grow together so 10-20 years from now and beyond, you are living a fulfilled and worthwhile life doing activities together that you have grown to love.", "NTA.

Speak to financial advisors and get that money locked away doing its thing for your family to enjoy forever. Obviously treat yourself too but if it's the amount that I've seen some USA stories about, you're not exactly going to be able to spend it all in a month are you.\n\nGiving away \u00a310,000,000 to a best friend so they can enjoy the lifestyle too is fucking stupid. I understand his concern that if he starts buying expensive cars or holidays or pokemon cards or PC's or whatever he's planning that his friend can't keep up and won't want to play with him anymore.

Will he get more? What if his friend invests it badly in the latest dumbcoin and tries to drag your husband in to it with him?

We weren't big lottery players, we'd buy the occasional tickets.  We never won anything, but we had  an agreement that of course we'd share any huge amounts that either of us would win.\n\nSo here was the other part of the agreement:  If we ever won an ungodly amount of money, we could tell MY family - but we agreed not to tell HIS family.  His family would want a huge cut of the money, they'd piss away every cent we would give them, and then they'd come back for more - rinse, lather, repeat.\n\nOur plan, since neither of us is very flashy or spendy, was to simply just not tell his family if we won.  How would we keep this from them?  Just quietly pay off our respective mortgages, and quietly quit our jobs without telling them.  If they asked how work was going?  Fine, we'd answer, nothing exciting going on.\n\nIt never came to fruition, of course.

If two closeted women stay single and are very affectionate BFFs, people usually assume they couldn't get husbands, while with men they are more likely to be suspicious, so closeted women have less incentive to marry as a cover, so you hear less often of married women who turned out to be closeted lesbians, so people are less suspicious etc.", "Because he\u2019s insisting he be part of this as though he was a marital partner.

Taxes will take a large chunk of the money so you need to prepare for it.    You may want may want to divide the winnings (after taxes) between yourself and your spouse so if you do divorce, he has a different spending style, you don\u2019t have to divide the portion you saved.   It makes more sense to me to put money in a trust for children/future children than it does to give to his friend.   You will find a lot of relatives and hear a lot of hard times stories if news of your winnings get out.   If you are afraid of your safety (we all have reasons to be cautious), you may want to quietly move to another area where you are less of a target.   Be careful and invest wisely.    There are a lot of people that win huge lotteries and are broke 2-5 years later.

It sounds like op has not had experience or knowledge of any type of financial abuse or betrayal. They\u2019ve not had friends or family that have been backstabbing since diapers. And they haven\u2019t experienced it in a relationship either. \n\nAnd IF that\u2019s the case, I truly feel so happy for them bc that\u2019s unnecessary heartbreak. \n\nBut the lottery is different. Even Donald Trump wealth is different. And just bc Tim hasn\u2019t been a business embezzler, and husband hasn\u2019t made astronomical purchases without asking first, or op hasn\u2019t experienced something equal to a spouse having an affair and cleaning out the accounts behind her back doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. \n\nBut I also think that both have been sheltered financially. How did it not occur to them to do research, plan, and seek out help or knowledge before the damn deadline?! It\u2019s like she hadn\u2019t even thought about taxes, and fines and investments etc. \n\nThey sat daydreaming. Can\u2019t find a lawyer/advisor!! No freaking way.

In fact, if you look at the data, most of the people who win and figure out a way to manage their winnings responsibly are much happier.  They just don't make the news so we never hear about it.  What we do hear about are the people who win big and then their life implodes in some spectacular, newsworthy fashion.", "It's not a BFF he's in a bowling league with. He's a BFF and *business partner*. He & his friend have sunk time and money into their business, ostensibly with the understanding that they'd both benefit when and if it takes off.

It could be that he wants to bail on the business, knows it'll fail without him, and wants to make sure his friend lands on his feet or isn't resentful.\n\nIt doesn't mean they're fucking. \n\nThat said, OP should *absolutely NOT* agree to giving him \u2153.

The best advice in this thread is to call a large firm in your nearest big city and get an estate attorney. They will help you set up trust for whatever you want to cover, to protect your money both from people asking for handouts and in case your marriage goes south. The lottery does terrible things to marriages, don't believe it couldn't happen to you.\n\nOnce the bulk of your money is protected you can set aside however much you want as gifts to certain people.
