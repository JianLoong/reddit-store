{"id": 22731, "submission_id": "154q89l", "title": "AITA For not wanting to split my jackpot win with my husbands friend?", "selftext": "\n\nI (F30) played the lottery for the first time last year when everyone was talking about the Powerball jackpot.  Since then I\u2019ve played casually, only spending a few dollars a week. I occasionally won a few bucks and never really expected to win anything big but it was nice to dream as I had a ton of  debt and have been struggling a lot.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago (won\u2019t say the month for privacy) I checked the winning numbers one night against my ticket and it matched with my numbers perfectly. Initially I didn\u2019t believe it and thought there had to be a mistake so I told my husband(M35) and we checked it like a dozen times and I was right, we won. It\u2019s Life changing, multi generational, fuck you money. \n\nWe instantly agreed to keep the news to ourselves and wait a few months before we did anything. The past few months have been an incredible high, filled with disbelief and though it\u2019s been difficult, we have managed not to make any large purchases or change our lifestyle. We fantasized about what to do with our money but the time to claim is drawing near so we have begun having more practical discussions about how to claim it and what to do with it. \n\nWhile discussing, my husband \u201cAdam\u201d brought up that he thinks it\u2019ll be a good idea to split the money with his best friend/ business partner \u201cTim\u201d. Tim and Adam have been friends since they were in middle school and have done everything together ever since. Together they\u2019ve started businesses, work together, invested money, moved to the same town and have often dreamed about our families making it big together. Since we have take risks together and are so close, Adam feels it\u2019s fair to give them 1/3 of the cash prize so that 1) we are not going on this journey to a new life alone 2) it\u2019s suspicious to make all this money suddenly and more easily explained if Tim \u201cmakes\u201dmoney as well since we do everything together. \n\nI however feel it\u2019s risky to share that we have come into this money with them because Tim\u2019s family tends to be more flashy and like showing off and I don\u2019t fully trust that they will keep it quiet or modest enough to not raise suspicion. This is important because I\u2019ve seen community members harass and attack people with far less money just because they feel entitled. This could jeopardize our safety so I want to avoid it if at all possible. Also I\u2019m not really comfortable with his plan to add Tim and his wife as members of our LLC to claim the prize (because I think it could have them feel entitled to a bigger chunk or take the money?)\n\nAdam thinks I\u2019m being selfish and he wont enjoy our new found wealth if his friend isn\u2019t living the same lifestyle but I think we could find a way to later give them some money after figuring out a way to explain how we came into money without telling them we won lottery (no idea how to do that yet). \n\nAnyway, AITA for not wanting to tell them we won the lottery and split the money? Am I selfish?", "created_utc": 1689857888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154q89l/aita_for_not_wanting_to_split_my_jackpot_win_with/", "score": 841, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since then I\u2019ve played casually, only spending a few dollars a week. I occasionally won a few bucks and never really expected to win anything big but it was nice to dream as I had a ton of  debt and have been struggling a lot.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago (won\u2019t say the month for privacy) I checked the winning numbers one night against my ticket and it matched with my numbers perfectly. Initially I didn\u2019t believe it and thought there had to be a mistake so I told my husband(M35) and we checked it like a dozen times and I was right, we won. It\u2019s Life changing, multi generational, fuck you money. \n\nWe instantly agreed to keep the news to ourselves and wait a few months before we did anything. The past few months have been an incredible high, filled with disbelief and though it\u2019s been difficult, we have managed not to make any large purchases or change our lifestyle. We fantasized about what to do with our money but the time to claim is drawing near so we have begun having more practical discussions about how to claim it and what to do with it. \n\nWhile discussing, my husband \u201cAdam\u201d brought up that he thinks it\u2019ll be a good idea to split the money with his best friend/ business partner \u201cTim\u201d. Tim and Adam have been friends since they were in middle school and have done everything together ever since. Together they\u2019ve started businesses, work together, invested money, moved to the same town and have often dreamed about our families making it big together. Since we have take risks together and are so close, Adam feels it\u2019s fair to give them 1/3 of the cash prize so that 1) we are not going on this journey to a new life alone 2) it\u2019s suspicious to make all this money suddenly and more easily explained if Tim \u201cmakes\u201dmoney as well since we do everything together. \n\nI however feel it\u2019s risky to share that we have come into this money with them because Tim\u2019s family tends to be more flashy and like showing off and I don\u2019t fully trust that they will keep it quiet or modest enough to not raise suspicion. This is important because I\u2019ve seen community members harass and attack people with far less money just because they feel entitled. This could jeopardize our safety so I want to avoid it if at all possible. Also I\u2019m not really comfortable with his plan to add Tim and his wife as members of our LLC to claim the prize (because I think it could have them feel entitled to a bigger chunk or take the money?)\n\nAdam thinks I\u2019m being selfish and he wont enjoy our new found wealth if his friend isn\u2019t living the same lifestyle but I think we could find a way to later give them some money after figuring out a way to explain how we came into money without telling them we won lottery (no idea how to do that yet). \n\nAnyway, AITA for not wanting to tell them we won the lottery and split the money? Am I selfish?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.
