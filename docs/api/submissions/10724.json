It\u2019s just a situation that sucks . \nIdeally you shouldn\u2019t be with someone kids you can\u2019t accept as your own but in reality very few do .", "She wants a college fund NTA", "Your are NTA for politely setting clear boundaries. It is best to avoid misunderstanding from the beginning.", "NTA. Go NC.", "Hmmm Sarah has never indicated she was trying to get anything out of you before. I honestly think she thinks of you as an important person in her life and wanted to give you a title that honors and reflects the kind of relationship she hopes you\u2019ll have with her child. She\u2019s trying to indicate to her children that you\u2019re family to her and to them.\n\nI think you should talk to her about it. Tell her you were caught off guard because you didn\u2019t realize how much of an impact you had on her. Tell her that you\u2019re honored she thinks of you as family, but you got caught up in the concern that you won\u2019t be present in her child\u2019s life the exact same way as your other grandkids. Make it about the relationship, not money. Insinuating she was after money when she has not indicated that at all will add insult to injury. You spend a lot of time with your grandkids, and you work hard to make sure they see that you love and support and spend time with them all equally. You got caught up worrying how your other grandkids might perceive another \u201cgrandchild\u201d that doesn\u2019t get the same benefits of holidays and sleepovers and special grandpa days. And at the same time, your child would have 3 grandpas, but \u201cgrandpa joe\u201d doesn\u2019t invite them over for Christmas or play a consistent role you think a grandpa should. You\u2019re thrilled to play some part in her child\u2019s life, you\u2019re thrilled she considers your family, but maybe grandpa isn\u2019t the right term to honestly encompass the type of relationship you\u2019re prepared to have. And it makes you feel strangely because you didn\u2019t know she saw you as her child\u2019s grandpa, and you\u2019re still getting used to it. Suggest something else. Something that indicates you are family, but gives you the space to be emotionally comfortable with it: Pop-pop Joe. Grandad Joe. Uncle Joe (short for great uncle!) \n\nI had two of the world\u2019s most loving, doting grandmas. But we developed a really close relationship with the little old lady across the street who had no family of her own and was so grateful my friends and I wanted to play in her garden (and help her shovel her walkways and water her plants while she was away, etc.) She adopted the neighborhood kids as her honorary grandkids and dropped us off Christmas gifts every year, so we started inviting her along with my actual grandparents to attend opening night of my musicals, or see my brother play lacrosse in the championship, etc. sometimes she got invited out to birthday dinners or to watch the Super Bowl or dropped off baked goods for her, just like we did grandma. I love half the country away but I write her letters now and she mails me cards with newspaper clippings or pressed flowers or little trinkets from her many adventures in Europe as a young woman. Which is completely different than my actual grandparents relationship. I didn\u2019t compare them to each other, I knew she wasn\u2019t actually my grandma, just like I knew my mom\u2019s best friend wasn\u2019t my \u201caunt Susan\u201d. I don\u2019t expect anything from her in her will. She has nieces and nephews and grand-nieces and nephews. But it has given us both many years of lovely companionship. And she has been an influential person in my life and memories! Don\u2019t let that pass you by!", "NTA", "This was my first thought, as well, that Sarah had a stronger emotional connection to OP than he did with her, which in and of itself is a lot to unpack.", "It breaks my heart but if he feels that way. I had a partner when my children was young 6 yo and 5months and we had a 8 years relationship. One day we had an argument over the phone and he blocked me and my oldest child on WhatsApp. He was the dad figure they knew, they used called him by his name but all the love and promises was there\n Sad you don't feel that way with it vut you cannot force you to like them. My children still remember him and it hurts, maybe foe you they was only importa bc of the relationship..YTA", "Wow you described my situation. I had 8 years relationship, my son was 5months old and daughter bit over 6. He turned his back and blocked all of us the same day we broke up. For them, he was their father and they had to go under therapy to understand how they had lost they dad twice. Unfortunately it might happen a lot. Because of man like this, I quite daring and don't want anything to do with it. Heartless is little to mention", "Asshole", "You must be my ex partner that this do to my children ae lived 8 years together. You make me feel sick. You should know what's goes around come around...", "I think the same. As single mother I had a guy like that in my life, he was my children father untill we broke up. Them he just turn his back to them.\nThey are hurt twice, maybe this is the case here. Pity he doesn't feel lobe for them so cannot force. Clearly OP just wanted their mother. Sad Asshole", "I call my step dad by his first name and it's been 20 years. I love him to the ends of the earth but it just never organically happened. As someone who didn't have a lot of strong male figures in her life I'm sure there is a desire to keep the man in her life thinking he at least loved her, and she valued their time. I think it sounds like just a misfortune situation for the daughter tbh.", "Nope. He just wanted their mother. Sad", "They\u2019re asking if OPs grandchildren call his ex grandma.", "Thank you!\n\nI have never heard the term \"grandpa\" or \"grandma\" used as a term of endearment. So many people are saying that in this thread and I don't get it!", "I\u2019ve definitely heard it done. Many cultures do it. But OP has stated that his doesn\u2019t, so I don\u2019t understand why this is such a sticking point for folks.", "Exactly. We all know this thing exists. But not in OP's culture, so why is everyone trying to hammer it home?"]}
