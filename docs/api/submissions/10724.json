On the one hand you made it about money. You could have kept that to yourself. On the other, your ex partner's daughter is presuming to elevate a relationship that wasn't at that level--I assume she didn't call you \"Dad\" when you were in the same household?", "INFO: what is her bio dad's involvement in her life? How old was she when you started a relationship with her mother?", "NAH\n\nInfo: It was the first time that you saw her husband?\n\nNAH\nI think it's better to make it clear now, as long as the Baby doesn't understand it. And I can understand that you don't want to be a Grandpa with different rules and also don't want to make a investment for Sarah's Baby.", "NTA, but this is a very delicate issue. Your ex-stepdaughter was probably trying to honor you with the title, but you sort of  slapped it in her face by rejecting it. However, you are under no obligation to accept being called Grandpa by her kids. Just kindly explain that you don't feel comfortable with the title as you are no longer in a relationship with her mother (your Ex) and you don't want her kids wondering why Grandpa doesn't visit or behave like their other grandparents as you won't be able to be that person in their lives. Do NOT use the reason that it is because you already have kids and grandkids though and that hers didn't make the cut. That would just be too cruel if your relationship with your Ex-stepdaughter meant a lot to her.", "INFO\n\nDoes Sarah come from a culture where children do not address adults by their first name?\n\nIf that's the case, to this kid, you could be, for instance, \"Mr. Joe\", \"Uncle Joe\", or \"Grandpa Joe\", but not just \"Joe\"\n\nGiven those choices, I could see why Sarah would pick \"Grandpa Joe\" as most fitting.", "NAH- you have every right to set your own rules in that relationship if it means that much to you however, I am sure she meant it in a nice way but there's no obligation there on you. You don't need to make it about money though but I do get that feeling  like you don't want to treat your biological grandchildren differently to each other and would feel bad about not treating Sarah's child equally if they see you as a grandad figure", "NTA, I would say NAH but they have no right to get mad at you for setting your boundaries. You didn\u2019t marry their mom. While you dated their mom for 10 year, you commented that y\u2019all only live together for 4 years. There was no parental feelings . All in all, you have the right to be wanting to be called however you wanted.", "Did she ever call you dad? Tell you she thought of you as a dad?", "NAH\n\nHowever it could be considered rude that you threw those terms of endearment/respect back in her face.", "INFO: do you have any idea what Sarah might expect out of you if you're called \"Grandpa\"?  \n\nI'm torn because it sounds like you think Sarah would assume to be treated the same as your kids and her baby the same as your grandkids. I don't know if that's true, but also- I could see hurt feelings in the future if/when Sarah and her brother realize they don't hold the same place in your life as your kids and grandkids.", "NTA\n\nThey don't get to decide what you're called. You don't want to be called grandpa Joe by their kids, just Joe. They need to respect that. They're being assholes by not doing so and trying to make it your problem.\n\nThese kids probably do look up to you as a father figure, tho, if you were a stable masculine presence in their life when they were growing up. But they still should respect your comfort levels.", "NTA.", "Maybe you could try one of those \"southern-sounding\" names, like Joe-Bob, Joe-Don \\[whatever your middle name is . . \\].  You're unique, but not Grandfather.", "She\u2019s not your daughter and her kid is NOT your grandchild. I have a feeling they want to get the financial rewards for their kid (like the other grand kids) and using the \u201cgramps\u201d card as a Segway into guilting you into including their kid. I say- do not include her kid into the mix with the other grandkids. That\u2019s for them to figure out. Their child is not your responsibility!

Sarah\u2019s kids have grandparents\u2026her actual parents and her husband\u2019s parents. If you\u2019re grandpa than that takes away from the real grandparents. If your grandpa than it takes away from your actual grandkids. \nGrandparent is not a loose term. \nSarah is old enough to know better regardless of you being in her home life for four years during high school. I think it\u2019s odd she would push this. It\u2019s odd she\u2019d think or feel equal to your children. \nYou do not meet the exception. The exception being..if you raised Sarah and consider her your child and you her father. Not the case here. \nSarah is putting you, and everyone else, in a very awkward situation. It\u2019s odd Sarah\u2019s mother hasn\u2019t stepped in to tell Sarah that\u2019s she inappropriate.", "What years of their childhood were those 10 years. I'm inclined to say YTA a bit, too. They obviously still feel a connection to you and keep in contact.", "You raised this woman for 10 years of her childhood and you are unhappy she considers you a father figure and grandfather figure to her child? What a devastating slap in the face that must have been to Sarah. My heart breaks for her. YTA", "NAH. \n\nThere are many people that use the term grandma and grandpa (and uncle and aunt) for kids of neighbours, friends and coworkers, and there's nothing wrong with that. The parents indicate to their children (and to the older people) that they trust that person with their child in some way, shape or form. It's pretty much a different word for 'friend' with a one or 2 generation gap. \n\nThen there's people like you, that consider your grandchildren only the ones that are related to you, who will eventually inherit from you, and whose future you want to invest in, and make commitments to. \n\nNeither is wrong, and while I get how you feel uncomfortable, the conclusion that your stepdaughter wants to use her kids as a way to secure a college fund or part of the inheritance is only in your mind. (There might be other reasons you'd think that, but they're not in your post). \n\nDid she call you 'dad', or refer to you as 'father' when you lived together? If so, she is surely not TA.\n\nDoes Sarah still have her actual father (in her life)?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
