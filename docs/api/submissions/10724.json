I honestly think she thinks of you as an important person in her life and wanted to give you a title that honors and reflects the kind of relationship she hopes you\u2019ll have with her child. She\u2019s trying to indicate to her children that you\u2019re family to her and to them.\n\nI think you should talk to her about it. Tell her you were caught off guard because you didn\u2019t realize how much of an impact you had on her. Tell her that you\u2019re honored she thinks of you as family, but you got caught up in the concern that you won\u2019t be present in her child\u2019s life the exact same way as your other grandkids. Make it about the relationship, not money. Insinuating she was after money when she has not indicated that at all will add insult to injury. You spend a lot of time with your grandkids, and you work hard to make sure they see that you love and support and spend time with them all equally. You got caught up worrying how your other grandkids might perceive another \u201cgrandchild\u201d that doesn\u2019t get the same benefits of holidays and sleepovers and special grandpa days. And at the same time, your child would have 3 grandpas, but \u201cgrandpa joe\u201d doesn\u2019t invite them over for Christmas or play a consistent role you think a grandpa should. You\u2019re thrilled to play some part in her child\u2019s life, you\u2019re thrilled she considers your family, but maybe grandpa isn\u2019t the right term to honestly encompass the type of relationship you\u2019re prepared to have. And it makes you feel strangely because you didn\u2019t know she saw you as her child\u2019s grandpa, and you\u2019re still getting used to it. Suggest something else. Something that indicates you are family, but gives you the space to be emotionally comfortable with it: Pop-pop Joe. Grandad Joe. Uncle Joe (short for great uncle!) \n\nI had two of the world\u2019s most loving, doting grandmas. But we developed a really close relationship with the little old lady across the street who had no family of her own and was so grateful my friends and I wanted to play in her garden (and help her shovel her walkways and water her plants while she was away, etc.) She adopted the neighborhood kids as her honorary grandkids and dropped us off Christmas gifts every year, so we started inviting her along with my actual grandparents to attend opening night of my musicals, or see my brother play lacrosse in the championship, etc. sometimes she got invited out to birthday dinners or to watch the Super Bowl or dropped off baked goods for her, just like we did grandma. I love half the country away but I write her letters now and she mails me cards with newspaper clippings or pressed flowers or little trinkets from her many adventures in Europe as a young woman. Which is completely different than my actual grandparents relationship. I didn\u2019t compare them to each other, I knew she wasn\u2019t actually my grandma, just like I knew my mom\u2019s best friend wasn\u2019t my \u201caunt Susan\u201d. I don\u2019t expect anything from her in her will. She has nieces and nephews and grand-nieces and nephews. But it has given us both many years of lovely companionship.

I had a partner when my children was young 6 yo and 5months and we had a 8 years relationship. One day we had an argument over the phone and he blocked me and my oldest child on WhatsApp. He was the dad figure they knew, they used called him by his name but all the love and promises was there\n Sad you don't feel that way with it vut you cannot force you to like them. My children still remember him and it hurts, maybe foe you they was only importa bc of the relationship..YTA", "Wow you described my situation. I had 8 years relationship, my son was 5months old and daughter bit over 6. He turned his back and blocked all of us the same day we broke up. For them, he was their father and they had to go under therapy to understand how they had lost they dad twice. Unfortunately it might happen a lot. Because of man like this, I quite daring and don't want anything to do with it. Heartless is little to mention", "Asshole", "You must be my ex partner that this do to my children ae lived 8 years together. You make me feel sick. You should know what's goes around come around...", "I think the same. As single mother I had a guy like that in my life, he was my children father untill we broke up. Them he just turn his back to them.\nThey are hurt twice, maybe this is the case here. Pity he doesn't feel lobe for them so cannot force. Clearly OP just wanted their mother. Sad Asshole", "I call my step dad by his first name and it's been 20 years. I love him to the ends of the earth but it just never organically happened. As someone who didn't have a lot of strong male figures in her life I'm sure there is a desire to keep the man in her life thinking he at least loved her, and she valued their time. I think it sounds like just a misfortune situation for the daughter tbh.", "Nope. He just wanted their mother. Sad", "They\u2019re asking if OPs grandchildren call his ex grandma.", "Thank you!\n\nI have never heard the term \"grandpa\" or \"grandma\" used as a term of endearment. So many people are saying that in this thread and I don't get it!", "I\u2019ve definitely heard it done. Many cultures do it. But OP has stated that his doesn\u2019t, so I don\u2019t understand why this is such a sticking point for folks.", "Exactly. We all know this thing exists. But not in OP's culture, so why is everyone trying to hammer it home?", "For the most part NTA. You are TA depending on how you look at the situation.\n\nIt's fine to not want to be the baby grandparent (so NTA to him) He doesn't know you yet nor have formed any bond.\n\nThe problem is Sarah has formed a bond with you. She sees you as a father figure and wants you for her child. You hurt her feelings and your explination to the brother was kind of....shitty. by rejecting the role of grandpa you basically rejected the role as father or father figure to Sarah and her brother. \n\nProbably should have done it more gently. Saying something like I care for you but I'd rather he thinks of me as a family friend rather than his grandparent. Simply asking to reference to as just Joe comes off as cold.", "NTA but I think you\u2019re still kind of a jerk", "YTA - obviously an unpopular opinion here, but hear me out. Sarah clearly loves and respects you so much that she thinks of you as a father figure and a grandfatherly figure for her child. Your rejection of the grandpa label was probably like a slap in the face. IMO, it would have been better for you to approach her about this privately at another time, not right in that moment. It\u2019s a privilege to be considered someone\u2019s grandparent wether or not you\u2019re genetically related- especially in a family where there is divorce and breakups. TBH, Sarah and her kid deserve better.", "Did she ever call you dad? How frequently do you talk to them and see them?", "NTA. I don\u2019t know more about their situation. However, it sounds like the step kids see you as a father figure. You may be the only one they relate to as dad. That said, you don\u2019t have to be grandpa to their children. Perhaps you could come up with another term like papa Joe that they could use instead. That would indicate the step kids relationship to you rather than their children\u2019s relationship to you. I have friends of my children that still call me mom. It is a term of endearment and respect. They have no expectations of an inheritance just affection.", "NAH. You were in their lives during  a formative time and their affection for you apparently exceeds your affection for them. What stung for Sarah and her brother is that you rejected the relationship they thought they had with you. Being rejected by someone you looked up to like a parent is a rejection like few others.\n\nThat said, you\u2019re not obligated to be the kid\u2019s grandfather. You\u2019re not still with Sarah\u2019s mom.", "Your telling her that you are generous with your children and grandchildren and don\u2019t want a two tier system was the moment she realized her relationship with you wasn\u2019t family like. She may be after money for her kids or she may have simply wanted the connection she felt in high school for her child.  Could be either.  You probably don\u2019t know how the actual bio parents/grandparents relate to her, her husband, and the baby.", "YTA", "If you\u2019re comfortable, why don\u2019t you reach out to Sarah to talk about it. Tell her that the \u201cgrandpa\u201d title was unexpected and you weren\u2019t sure how to react. Maybe her kid(s) could call you something else that is special,  but doesn\u2019t have a familial connotation. Like a play on your name (using your example Joe-Joe G-joe, GI joe, Joe-man.) Botg my father and my FIL have passed so our kids don\u2019t have a living grandfather. We do have family friends/neighbors in that age category that our kids have unique names for. The kids totally understand that they are not blood related- but are still special. There are no \u201cgrandfather\u201d expectations, although the relationships are cute and special. Or if you prefer not, that\u2019s ok too. You are perfectly allowed to not want to be a grandfather figure to her kids. But if you really think it\u2019s not a ploy to gain financial support- then let her down easy. She prob thought she was honoring/complimenting you.", "Since you feel guilty, have you thought of another name you would like to be called that isn't grandpa?  Something less formal?", "By bringing up the money and college funds, you gave the impression that Sarah was doing this for mercenary reasons and now a bunch of Redditors have decided this woman is a cold-hearted gold digger when she was trying to express that you are part of her family.", "It sounds to me like Sarah was broken-hearted over this. She probably has warm feelings for OP and thought to honor him with the title of grandpa. OP bringing up money and college funds also gave Redditors the impression this was a mercenary money grab.", "This comment made me double take because I literally had a grandma whose partner was named Paul. We all called him just Paul.", "We have never called friends of the family aunt or uncle. They were called by their names. But when my stepkids\u2019 grandmother died, my parents said they could call them grandma and grandpa if they wanted to. I have been divorced from their father for almost 20 years, they are in their 30s and still consider my father their grandfather. (My mother passed away recently.) But my parents made that choice. All the stepkids and adopted kids consider my parents/father their grandparents. It\u2019s really very sweet and my parents were heavily involved while they were all growing up. Even my niece\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s little boy calls my father granddad. If OP isn\u2019t really involved in Sara\u2019s life anymore it\u2019s certainly understandable that he\u2019s uncomfortable being called grandpa.", "NTA, it seems smart to keep a separation between them, regardless of their awareness of your college funds for your own grandkids. Of course that doesn't preclude a relationship with the baby but it does make expectations clear.", "NAH\n\nSome people like calling close friends or people who hold a special place for them with familial titles. Others are more reserved about it. Is there a nickname you would be okay with them calling you? That might help heal the wound and show that you do care about her and her child, but view the relationship as something unique from your grandchildren. It can still be special without being grandpa.", "NAH. I can understand feeling a stronger connection to your own biological children, especially given the longer duration of those relationships.  \n\nI can also understand your stepdaughter\u2019s perspective. You were likely the closest thing she\u2019s. had in her life as a father-like figure. When you haven\u2019t had something, getting a taste of it can really make you want more. So I can understand why she was hoping to extend that same experience to her own daughter. I can understand why she felt upset. I also agree with some other comments that the way you expressed your feelings to her was delivery was somewhat harsh. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you about my own experience of being the step-grandchild. My dad\u2019s dad (Grandpa A) died from cancer when he was really young, leaving my grandma a widow with several children. She eventually remarried my grandpa, technically step-grandpa (Grandpa B).  By this time, the children were 11-19 years old. \n\nMany men don\u2019t want to raise another man\u2019s kids so to speak, so it\u2019s become special to me realizing that he chose to become part of our family.  Though this only happened when my dad was a teenager, he had a massive impact. With the second income added (my grandma continued to teach even after marrying Grandpa A), a number of things became easier, such as my dad and his siblings being able to go to college / university with no debt vs. worrying about scholarships or loans. He also helped my grandma with the money needed to get her own university / college degree.  My dad also got to experience having a dad again. \n\nGrandpa A was quite the guy and I know my dad appreciates the family research I\u2019ve done as he knows a lot more about him now. My grandma took A\u2019s death hard and didn\u2019t really talk about him, though I know she loved him until the day she died. I also feel a bit more complete knowing about what he was like as genetically he\u2019s a part of me. I\u2019m also told him and me were quite similar in a number of ways and it helps me feel like I fit into this family of mine. \n\nGrandpa B treated us like his own grandkids and I am so thankful for that. My other grandpa died when I was young, so this is probably why I feel so strongly about the relationship we had. He was there when I scraped up my knees multiple times. Shared milestones. He was also the one to visit me and my mom in the hospital after I was born.", "I\u2019m a step-parent, and I can\u2019t imagine how you were with them for 10 years and never saw it as \u201cparently\u201d, unless they were teenagers when you first met them. That must feel so hurtful for those two to know that you were around for those 10 years and don\u2019t see them as your kids in any way.", "I totally agree. How cold of a person can you be to have children in your life for that long and not feel attached to them.", "Maybe?  I have a good friend who's mom got married to his stepdad when we were in HS.  He calls the guy by his first name, but his kids call them grandpa so it's definitely possible.", "My parents would be extremely hurt if my kids started calling them by their first names, their chosen grandparent titles are indeed considered terms of endearment, honour and respect by many people including everyone I know. I\u2019ve never even heard of this not being the case.", "More than if I consider someone a grandkid to myself, I would feel wrong applying separate rules.", "I know. I apologize for using a stereotype but when i hear auntie i think of indian soap operas (i watched a few and they called everyone auntie). But op said that this wasn't part of his culture, so not the same thing.", "Nta does your exstepdaughter know how generous you are with your actual grandkids. If that\u2019s the case maybe she\u2019s expecting the same treatment and trying to push the grandfather role on you. I would set some clear boundaries and letting her know that you are not the grandfather you could be a family friend and so on but she needs to understand that you\u2019re not the grandfather And she needs to accept that and respect that if she wants to be a part of your life. Honestly you guys seem more like acquaintances in my opinion she\u2019s never called you dad never had a father really relationship with you and all of a sudden she\u2019s trying to push her child on you I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s expecting a college fun and I would make it very clear that\u2019s not gonna happen don\u2019t let her take advantage of you. You owe her nothing", "Nta. Nobody is owed a relationship. You aren\u2019t her father. You don\u2019t want to be her kids\u2019 grandpa. You have your own family.

She could instantly see from their reaction that this was THE WRONG THING. The story went on, and the BF broke up with her, basically because of it.\n\nIt's not a casual thing to do---unlike, for instance the many times kids are encouraged to call all their parents' friends Aunt and Uncle.", "I\u2019m wondering this too. If I saw a basically stepparent as a father figure, and then this happened, I would be pretty sad and have to reevaluate our whole relationship.  OP said he doesn\u2019t believe her motives were financial so she has no idea why he rejected her or that he didn\u2019t feel close to her. That hurts. He\u2019s NTA but I can see why she was upset.", "why are you so cynical why would money be a part of this", "you're def too cynical why on earth would you think that", "I don\u2019t call my stepmother Mom and never will/would, but my kids are her step-grandkids and call her by the same thing my step-siblings\u2019 kids do. And my wife has never called her father\u2019s wife Mom, but her son calls her Grandma (Name). And I called both of my step-great-grandfathers Pop Pop, just like their other grandchildren and great-grands. That kind of thing is common in blended families, at least where I\u2019m from. (Kind of like calling one\u2019s godparents Aunt & Uncle even when they\u2019re not bio relatives.)", "In my family, it absolutely is a term of endearment, and that is true for all of my friends\u2019 families as well. I would never call my grandparents by their first name. Ever. That\u2019s a very unfair assumption to make. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a regional thing, or cultural thing, or maybe because I grew up with Christian families but it\u2019s not fair to assume it\u2019s not an honorific. It is, just like aunt or uncle.  Since we can\u2019t ask her, don\u2019t assume.", "OP told us, so we dont have to assume.", "His explanation is a bit dismissive though. Because she views him as a father figure, it\u2019s not as though she\u2019s assigning some random title. She assigned it because of that relationship she has with him.
