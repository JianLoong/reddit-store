You should not be the sole carrier of the responsibility of your special needs sister, and if she is high functioning and PURPOSELY urinating/defecating just for YOU, that is unacceptable.\n\nMy advice: Run when you can and don\u2019t look back.

My advice would be to do everything you can to get into college, sort out your life in the way it's best for you, and maintain low contact with your family once you leave. They could also be setting the ground for you to assume responsibility for your sister in the future once they can no longer take care of her, and you need to plan out your life now so that you're in a good position to say \"no\" to that later on.\n\nYour sister is absolutely TA for targeting you this way, despite her condition, and your mother/parents are TA for neglecting you.", "NTA you can\u2019t be an AH for not liking a sibling, even if they\u2019re special needs. \n\nI can\u2019t tell from the info if it\u2019s the disability or if she has capacity and is taking advantage of her \u201cinnocence\u201d you can\u2019t really blame your sister either. \n\nIf anyone is the AH here it is your mum for not understanding. \n\nYou\u2019re in a tough spot.", "NTA. I don't know what is going in with your sister but you shouldn't have to deal with this. Your mother is being totally unreasonable. I wonder if she too finds your sister, shall we say, challenging to deal with. She puts it all on you and then gets angry when you complain. It's easier for her to get angry at you than at your sister. That is most unfair.\n\nDo you have other relatives or friends you can spend time with? You need some respite from this. In time you can leave home and your mother will have to cope on her own.", "NTA\n\nI mean... Your feelings are valid. You are in a stressful situation, you are trying to be a good sister. Not liking the situation doesn't mean that you don't love your sister. Your parents should be asking you how you feel about all of this. They aren't validating your feelings. I'm sure that your parents are under some level of stress and are doing the best they can. However, you need your own attention, and just because your sister has needs doesn't mean that you don't. You can't just ignore your needs. Being 16 is its own stressful thing in any situation.\n\nYour mom is telling you to watch your sibling. Yes, 16 year olds aren't little kids and you can babysit and have responsibilities, but you also aren't a parent. This is a huge responsibility that you didn't sign up for. Obviously, this isn't to say be a brat and never help out, but like I said... this is a big responsibility.\n\nI will tell you this: You aren't judging her or her situation. You are reacting normally to a stressful environment.\n\nI feel like your parents didn't ask it, so I'll ask this:\n\nHow does all this make you feel?\n\nDo you feel like you are under extra stress?\n\nIf so, is this stress affecting you negatively?\n\nDo you feel as though you are able to talk to your parents about your stress or how this makes you feel?\n\nI would first recommend talking with your school counselor. They are trained to help with conflict and stress. This way you can have a regular place to talk about stress and things that anger you. You should also talk to your parents. Tell them how this is making you feel. I realize this will be an intimidating conversation, so maybe even practice role-playing the conversation with your school counselor before you have this conversation.", "NTA - It sounds like your parents see your sister as their golden child, likely because of her condition, and see you as a scapegoat and her default caregiver. This is the dynamic your parents have fostered, so while your younger sister does need to have some accountability, she\u2019s not the main one at fault here. She was taught that this kind of behavior is okay or acceptable to do to you. It\u2019s not.\n\nYou deserve to have a life outside of your family, including your sister. You both deserve parents who care, in your case that\u2019s parents who don\u2019t make you shoulder their responsibilities, in her case that\u2019s parents who work with her to teach her proper boundaries.\n\nYour feelings are jumbled and complex because you\u2019re in a jumbled and complex situation. It\u2019s unfair to you. Once you\u2019re 18, it might be healthy to put as much distance between yourself and your family as possible. Give yourself the space and time to process all of this on your own, and decide for yourself how you wish to pursue or maintain your relationship with your sister, if at all. It sounds like every interaction with your sister was out of your control, because you were made to feel like it was your obligation, so you haven\u2019t been able to properly form a personal bond with her on your own.", "I predict today on the 26.8.23 at 5pm that there will come a time in the near future when you pop. You will explode. You will verbally tear down those close to you because you can't take it anymore. You love your sister but eventually  but the resentment of her behaviour and lopsided expectations of you in regards to her will out weigh your love. People will call you a monster and cruel and not understand ' where on earth this could have come from?' But at this point you will not care anymore what their opinion is. \nLink this post and let them know that Internet people called it.\nCan it be avoided? Yes. But u requires you to be assertive and say what you need. No to sister now but maybe yes tomorrow? No to cleaning fecal matter till parents understand how often it is and a lock is on your door, but yes to looking after her once in a while. However, this also requires that the parents listen. Be a broken record. Calm and on repeat", "NTA. I so feel for you. My younger sister is severely disabled and I had to watch her a lot when I was a kid. I also went through a period as a teenager where I didn't like her. \n\nThere are a multitude of reasons why she behaves poorly for you and it unfortunately is not uncommon from my experience. My younger sister went through a period for 2 years where she was aggressive to our mom and only our mom. If my mom had the nerve to merely stand in her vicinity, she would pinch, bite, head butt, etc. until my mom left. If I remember correctly, it's not atypical for those with delays to show aggression or otherwise behave poorly for specific people. Going on antidepressants actually helped curb the aggression and my mom was \n\nIt might be time to sit down with your parents and ask that they consult with a professional on this. It's not cool that they're downplaying what is happening.

They HATED each other all through growing up and through school. K was jealous of S because she got so much attention. S was jealous of K because she was pretty and smart and had lots of friends. As a parent this broke my heart because, well, we have visions of how we want our family to be. \n\nFast forward to K going to college. Her and S started handwriting and mailing letters to each other. I have no idea who wrote the first one but it changed everything. They are so close now, resentments are gone and S is even in K's upcoming wedding. You have every right to be angry and hurt. your sister is doing this TO YOU. I hope something at some point will change.", "NTA for feeling the way you do and being frustrated.  While it sounds like your sister does intentionally target you, I think a lot of this stems from your parents too.  It sounds like they've enabled her to act the way she does.  I'm not saying don't be mad at your sister, cause you have every right to be, but understand your parents are also to blame for her acting this way.  They've taught her it's ok to treat you the way she does.  If they'd corrected her, this situation probably wouldn't exist.  \n\nGood luck OP.

I know some cats do that when their upset with their owners\u2026. I would suggest that if your mother makes you watch her again do so in the living room and shut your bedroom door so she doesn\u2019t do it in there.
