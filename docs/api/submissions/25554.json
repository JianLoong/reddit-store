A bit context of what's going on. My little sister is a high-functioning special needs girl. She understands cues and she's really smart, but her behavior holds her back. \n\nI have to watch her if my mom runs out. If I go somewhere with friends, she often follows right along, and if I even breathe a word about wanting to be alone for once, or having our older brother watch her, I get yelled at and called ungrateful and judging of her conditions. \n\nWhenever I watch her, she will shit and piss on my fucking floor as a retaliation for me having to watch her. She'll get it everywhere, and once last year, I got my room redone for my birthday, but I came back to piss on my new carpet and floor. \n\nThis is frustrating ONLY BECAUSE she doesn't do it to anybody else. She's the perfect little angel to everyone else but when she gets with me, she makes my life a living hell, and based on the way my mom thinks, it's my fault for \"not watching her close enough\" or I'm \"just being overdramatic because it's just pee/poop.\" She doesn't do this with ANYBODY else, besides me, so it's like my mother has NO SAY in telling me it's \"just poop.\" \n\nCut to yesterday-today. My sister is sick, with what my mother thinks is either a fever or food poisoning. Now, I'm a big germaphobe, and hate sickness no matter who it is, but as I explained to my mother why I didn't want to give her a KISS. She said it was just because I don't like my sister and starts yelling and screaming at me because I don't like her, then she storms out of the house and starts crying, and I'm left here feeling like shit. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my sister, because she's my sister, but i just dont like her. It makes sense in my head but I'm really stressed on what to do. I'm tired of my room smelling like feces and urine. I'm tired of my mother not hearing me out. My other family sees the unfairness of the situation and allow me to stay with them for a little bit to get a break, but I have to come back eventually. \n\nAnybody have any tips on what to do? I genuinely want to have a good relationship with my sister, but I everytime I try (I take her out once in a while) it comes back to bite me in the butt. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nThank you all so much on your quick responses, they really mean a lot and have put me at rest a bit. I'll try to answer a few questions I saw. \n\n1. My sister can comprehend things, just as you and I can, but doesn't know how to CONVEY those emotions she's feeling. \n\n2. If I can physically keep her from pooping or peeing herself, she'll make herself throw up, and I'll get yelled at x10 for that. \n\n3. My brother, infact- ALL of my brothers moved out, just to get out of watching her.  I have three older brothers, one is T(25), the other is K(23) and the last one is N(20)\nT and N moved over due to the military a while ago and K is living with us right now, but is quickly trying to move out to avoid taking care of my sisters. And even when they visit, they'll play with her, but refuse to watch her whenever I need a break, or call me down ALL THE WAY FROM MY ROOM just to change her. They said it was because they were guys and didn't want to see their sisters vag, but I don't want to see that either??? But nobody cares. \n\n4. My mother will KILLLLL me if I lock my door. Closing my door is fine, but locking it makes her feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't. (So no privacy whatsoever, got it.)\n\n5. My outer family try to talk to my mother, but she never wants to hear it. Don't get me wrong, I love and ADOREEE my mama from the bottom of my heart, but she says she just needs a break and I'm there. I'm a people pleaser and I hate letting people down, but this is a lot for me, ESPECIALLY since I'm in my junior year AND I'm graduating early, so I'm taking EXTRA classes.", "created_utc": 1693064713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161ymac/aita_for_not_liking_my_special_needs_little_sister/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My advice would be to do everything you can to get into college, sort out your life in the way it's best for you, and maintain low contact with your family once you leave. They could also be setting the ground for you to assume responsibility for your sister in the future once they can no longer take care of her, and you need to plan out your life now so that you're in a good position to say \"no\" to that later on.\n\nYour sister is absolutely TA for targeting you this way, despite her condition, and your mother/parents are TA for neglecting you.", "NTA you can\u2019t be an AH for not liking a sibling, even if they\u2019re special needs. \n\nI can\u2019t tell from the info if it\u2019s the disability or if she has capacity and is taking advantage of her \u201cinnocence\u201d you can\u2019t really blame your sister either. \n\nIf anyone is the AH here it is your mum for not understanding. \n\nYou\u2019re in a tough spot.", "NTA. I don't know what is going in with your sister but you shouldn't have to deal with this. Your mother is being totally unreasonable. I wonder if she too finds your sister, shall we say, challenging to deal with. She puts it all on you and then gets angry when you complain. It's easier for her to get angry at you than at your sister. That is most unfair.\n\nDo you have other relatives or friends you can spend time with? You need some respite from this. In time you can leave home and your mother will have to cope on her own.", "NTA\n\nI mean... Your feelings are valid. You are in a stressful situation, you are trying to be a good sister. Not liking the situation doesn't mean that you don't love your sister. Your parents should be asking you how you feel about all of this. They aren't validating your feelings. I'm sure that your parents are under some level of stress and are doing the best they can. However, you need your own attention, and just because your sister has needs doesn't mean that you don't. You can't just ignore your needs. Being 16 is its own stressful thing in any situation.\n\nYour mom is telling you to watch your sibling. Yes, 16 year olds aren't little kids and you can babysit and have responsibilities, but you also aren't a parent. This is a huge responsibility that you didn't sign up for. Obviously, this isn't to say be a brat and never help out, but like I said... this is a big responsibility.\n\nI will tell you this: You aren't judging her or her situation. You are reacting normally to a stressful environment.\n\nI feel like your parents didn't ask it, so I'll ask this:\n\nHow does all this make you feel?\n\nDo you feel like you are under extra stress?\n\nIf so, is this stress affecting you negatively?\n\nDo you feel as though you are able to talk to your parents about your stress or how this makes you feel?\n\nI would first recommend talking with your school counselor. They are trained to help with conflict and stress. This way you can have a regular place to talk about stress and things that anger you. You should also talk to your parents. Tell them how this is making you feel. I realize this will be an intimidating conversation, so maybe even practice role-playing the conversation with your school counselor before you have this conversation.", "NTA - It sounds like your parents see your sister as their golden child, likely because of her condition, and see you as a scapegoat and her default caregiver. This is the dynamic your parents have fostered, so while your younger sister does need to have some accountability, she\u2019s not the main one at fault here. She was taught that this kind of behavior is okay or acceptable to do to you. It\u2019s not.\n\nYou deserve to have a life outside of your family, including your sister. You both deserve parents who care, in your case that\u2019s parents who don\u2019t make you shoulder their responsibilities, in her case that\u2019s parents who work with her to teach her proper boundaries.\n\nYour feelings are jumbled and complex because you\u2019re in a jumbled and complex situation. It\u2019s unfair to you. Once you\u2019re 18, it might be healthy to put as much distance between yourself and your family as possible. Give yourself the space and time to process all of this on your own, and decide for yourself how you wish to pursue or maintain your relationship with your sister, if at all. It sounds like every interaction with your sister was out of your control, because you were made to feel like it was your obligation, so you haven\u2019t been able to properly form a personal bond with her on your own.", "I predict today on the 26.8.23 at 5pm that there will come a time in the near future when you pop. You will explode. You will verbally tear down those close to you because you can't take it anymore. You love your sister but eventually  but the resentment of her behaviour and lopsided expectations of you in regards to her will out weigh your love. People will call you a monster and cruel and not understand ' where on earth this could have come from?' But at this point you will not care anymore what their opinion is. \nLink this post and let them know that Internet people called it.\nCan it be avoided? Yes. But u requires you to be assertive and say what you need. No to sister now but maybe yes tomorrow? No to cleaning fecal matter till parents understand how often it is and a lock is on your door, but yes to looking after her once in a while. However, this also requires that the parents listen. Be a broken record. Calm and on repeat", "NTA. I so feel for you. My younger sister is severely disabled and I had to watch her a lot when I was a kid. I also went through a period as a teenager where I didn't like her. \n\nThere are a multitude of reasons why she behaves poorly for you and it unfortunately is not uncommon from my experience. My younger sister went through a period for 2 years where she was aggressive to our mom and only our mom. If my mom had the nerve to merely stand in her vicinity, she would pinch, bite, head butt, etc. until my mom left. If I remember correctly, it's not atypical for those with delays to show aggression or otherwise behave poorly for specific people. Going on antidepressants actually helped curb the aggression and my mom was actually able to care for her daughter again. \n\nIt might be time to sit down with your parents and ask that they consult with a professional on this. It's not cool that they're downplaying what is happening. I assume your sister has a doctor who is aware of her history and could offer some advice on how to deal with these behaviors.", "NTA.", "Omg NTA.  I would try to live somewhere else.

Your mother has some issues she needs to address, but she's the adult here, not you.

And not a relative as your mom ignores them. Is there a trusted teacher you could talk to?  A carer or doctor or therapist of your sister's who knows what she's like? Someone needs to talk some sense into your mom. It's true, your mom does need breaks, but what she needs is respite care, NOT forcing you into caring for your disabled sibling when it's causing you extreme anxiety and affecting your studies. I don't have a problem with kids helping out in the home, with babysitting siblings sometimes, it teaches them empathy and how to take care of others. But that's not what you're doing.

Now your parents have realised you're the last chance to place parental responsibilities on one of their kids, so they're pushing it even harder. \n\nStand your ground more. Spend as little time as possible at home. Do things like go straight to the library after school to get your homework done. Arrange as much time with friends and extended family as you can. Make sure the time with friends is for things your sister can't attend as much as possible. Agree to babysit every now and then, say a couple hours on the weekend, to give your parents a break, but don;t agree to more than that. Keep the time spent with your sister outside of your bedroom. If you can buy a lock for your bedroom door and install it, do so, and then refuse to remove it. Better yet, by a few easily installable locks so that if/when your parents remove the lock you can just put a new one on. Make it a rule that your sister isn't allowed in your room. If she gets in anyway and does her usual, move your things out of the bedroom and into the living room, make up a bed for yourself and say 'this is now my bedroom until you clean up your daughter's mess in what is supposed to be my room'. Since they think it's nothing, they should have zero issue with cleaning up after her.\n\nMake strict rules you're not willing to break when it comes to your private space and any time you spend with your sister. Get your extended family and another adult from the school to back you up.
