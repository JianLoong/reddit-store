Are you best man chosen for your looks or for a different reason.", "NAH.  You do have a right to your haircut but she also has a right to have her wedding the way she wants it.  You do need to be up front and tell the groom that you don\u2019t plan on cutting it and understand if that means you can\u2019t be in the wedding.  If you don\u2019t do that then you are the asshole.", "NTA if you want an ugly hair cut no one is stopping you - but be prepared to be dropped as best man.  You can demand how people present at a wedding - particularly when those people are in the wedding party - you expect that as the bride you are the only one in a white dress.  You expect people to dress up and not roll up in shorts and flip flops (unless that is the theme of the wedding). Bridesmaids wear what the bride picked out, groomsmen wear the suit they are asked to - it\u2019s all part of the theatre.  \n\nMullets scream \u201clow rent\u201d.  I wouldn\u2019t want that in my photos either.", "Usually in situations like this I\u2019m on the hair side, but a mullet?? Literally nobody on earth looks good with a mullet. The bride is right. Everyone will be looking at your stupid hair and not at her. NAH, just cut it normal before the wedding or wear a wig.", "NAH. It's your right to do what you like with your hair, but as part of the wedding party, you will be in the photos. It isn't unreasonable for her to not want you sporting a mullet for her wedding photos.", "Yta it's not about you.", "Wig or a nice hat dude, compromise without having to cut it off.", "Several thousand miles away and you're expected to change your personal appearance? No thanks. NTA", "NTA, But let her know you won't be cutting hair, a best man is alot different then a normal guest, I think someone should be chosen not based on looks or anything but friendship, but others are different, this might be a deal breaker to them wanting you as best man.", "NTA you could have the worst hair cut ever and still nobody can tell you to change it. unless you buzz slurs into the side of your head i guess. \n\nalso sorry everyone\u2019s hating on ur mullet lol , my mother just got one and it looks beautiful ! don\u2019t let that bother you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
