They\u2019ve been together for around 9 ish months. They\u2019re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I\u2019ve only met John a handful of times.

We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.\n\nI invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal.

She's not married to your brother but still making demands?  Wowza, lol! That's entitlement on a new level.\n\nThe only reason her son was crying over this is because she told him *alllll* about it.  This is her fault. I hope your brother realizes what kind of person she is in time.\n\nNTA.  Hope you and your nephew (and ex-SIL) have a really wonderful time!", "NTA.\n\nThis is all about the fact she\u2019s not going and ex wifey is and she\u2019s weaponizing the kid.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have put you on the spot infront of family nor should she have taken it to FB!  Just because \u201cyou have the means\u201d does not mean you have to share it. It\u2019s a beautifully generous thing you\u2019re doing for your nephew and friend. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business to tell you what to do with your hard earned money. Had this new gf and son been around years upon years I would have perhaps said it would have been nice to atleast ask.", "NTA. You can do nice things for your nephew without having to pay for the kids of whoever your brother is dating at that time.", "NTA. No one should assume someone else is going to pay for their child to go anywhere, much less an overnight trip. If he loves Disney, she can take him. If his feelings are hurt he\u2019s not going to Disney, that\u2019s on her, especially since she apparently chose to share information on the trip with her toddler.", "NTA.     \n\n\nIf she had come to you like a reasonable person and asked nicely - that would be a different situation.  But coming at you, guns hot, making demands of what you should be doing?   From someone you barely know?   OH HELL NO.    She screwed herself out of the possibility of this trip and any others.   \n\n\nI hope your brother wakes up and smells the bitchiness.", "NTA. Good for you for putting an immediate stop to her entitled behavior.", "NTA. You don't need to be responsible for a kid even your brother has known for less than a year. Most parents of 5 year olds wouldn't want to send them off for a week with their boyfriend's ex and boyfriend's sister that they barely know or have known for less than a year.", "Your brother\u2019s gf has some audacity! You family that are siding with her need to fork over their own cash if they think her behavior is acceptable. You are not their ATM. NTA.", "NTA. New gf has brass ones though; nine months into dating someone and she thinks her bf's sister should treat her child to a trip to Disney. I hope your brother notices this red flag of entitlement she's waving in her face.", "<<I told her I didn\u2019t like the entitled mentality and to make it a point I would make sure to exclude her from all future family gatherings.>> I mean, this was completely OTT, but other than that ... NTA. \n\nI'd like to add, the only way John spent the whole night crying about missing out on Disney is if someone sat down, told him about the Disney trip, and explained that he wasn't invited.", "NTA\n\n Wth is it with people asking their fuck buddy's family to pay for their kids?? She's not married to your brother, and even if she were, you don't have to pay for him to go to disney. If she wants her son (who at 5, i doubt he understands all this or that he cried all night) at disney, she and/or the kid's dad and their famillies can take him.", "NTA \n\nGirl needs to stay in her lane \n\nThey haven\u2019t been dating long", "NTA. Wow, what an entitled brat your brothers GF is. It's your money, do whatever you want with it. Don't make yourself uncomfortable for them. You're totally in the right to tell her how it is - she's not family, you barely know her and her son, and she's not welcome to just invite herself and her son to family holidays, ESPECIALLY if she's not paying. Good lord, when did people become so damn entitled that they think other people deserve them whatever they want. \n\nI hope your family comes around to the fact that they're being dumb idiots and your boyfriend's girl is acting like a spoiled brat. And, most importantly, as others have stated, she's weaponizing her kid against you because she's mad the ex gets to go but not her. Seriously, screw her.", "NTA if the kid found out and was crying who told him. My money is on the gf.", "NTA.  I don't think you went far enough!  Who the hell does this?  She's a relatively new GF and it's a major red flag that she already thinks her son is not being treated as part of the family.  He's NOT part of the family!  You are most certainly not excluding or isolating her child!  I'd distance my self her ASAP.", "NTA. You don't have to pay to bring anyone on a vacation. \n\nYou can certainly take your nephew and your best friend on a trip. Leave Entitled Ethel at home.", "NTA\n\nThe entitlement is truly shocking. \n\nShe really expects you to gift her $2K? \n\nYou maybe took it too far with saying you would deliberately exclude her but to have the nerve to demand it of you to begin with is completely outrageous.", "ESH - I think the only part where you were the AH is where you made it a point to tell her that you'll exclude her and her kids from future family gatherings.   Why do you get to do that?  You get to decide for the whole family if she's accepted or not?  Did you ask the others for permission to run their relationships?    You were very cruel.    \n\nYou could have told her the trip was planned before you ever met her or just told her she was out of line for the entitled mentality (which I agree was a super AH move on her part) or some other lesser dickish way of brushing her off.\n\nKindness to new additions to the family is free.", "NTA. They are just one step up from random strangers to you at this point. You can't invite the whole world and his grandmother (or nephew) to Disney. Talk about being entitled!", "Wow, I'm guessing she carries those gigantic balls of hers in a separate bag!  Sure, bitch to your boyfriend's sister, whom you don't really know very well, about her not getting your child a $2k gift trip.  The entitlement is monumental!", "NTA.", "NTA", "Changing my verdict to ESH.  I missed the part about you excluding them from all future gatherings.  You could have made you point using civility but instead you lost your temper.  Not a good look for you.\n\nN t a for not including your brother's current girlfriend's kid.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of mothers around here complaining that their kids aren't being treated as a bio relative of their boyfriend's family.  Like wtf?\n\nEven if these women treated their boyfriend's parents like their MIL and FIL (which I suspect they don't), no one is at all obligated to treat these women's kid equal to their own grandchildren or nephew.\n\nIt's hella jealousy.\n\nNow I think you didn't have to blow up at her - you could have just said it never occurred to you to invite her son because he isn't close to you.  Followed by, you have no intention of inviting him.", "ESH. There's no problem with only taking your nephew. Your money, your choice. It might be different if they were around long enough or married such that you were needing my the dynamics of a blended family, but that's not what is happening here.  Also your family shouldn't tell you what to do with your money. I do think you went too far in blowing up and planning to exclude this kid from all family gatherings in the future. Kind of feels like you were spoiling for a fight.", "ESH. \n\nIf you hadn't blown up at her the way you did, it would've been NTA.\n\nYou were def NTA for not inviting the GF's son. If you were inviting your brother too, and not the GF and son, I can understand the complaints. But you were only inviting the brother's ex and son \u2014 your best friend and son. Why should you include the other son?\n\nBut by saying you would \"exclude the GF from all future family gatherings\" was going way way too far. If she's regularly seeing yr brother, she's going to become more and more a part of family gatherings. Yes, maybe the relationship will not last. But maybe it will. I think your threat to exclude her from family gatherings was the wrong way to approach it.\n\nNow there's all this fallout...not sure how to resolve. You could apologize for going too far, but explain this is a trip for you and your best friend; so why should someone else's kid be included?", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It isn\u2019t like you excluded them from a family dinner. This is a week long expensive trip for you to enjoy with your nephew and best friend. You have no reason to invite or pay for anyone else. Your finances aren\u2019t an invitation to anyone and every one. This child at this point is no one to you.  I\u2019d never include her in anything from this point forward. She\u2019s a new girlfriend and that child isn\u2019t family to you. She needs to learn her place.", "NTA you are taking your bf & her son (who happens to be your nephew) to Disney. This has nothing to do with your brother. Why in hell would he think his ex would want to spend time with his gf\u2019s child?  The entitlement here is off the charts ridiculous!", "NTA - It's a very nice gesture to go to Disney with your best friend and nephew and pay their way.  I don't understand why the gf would think her son should be included. I would not offer to take the gf's son even if someone else pays his way.  You and this boy are virtually strangers to each other.  So many things could go wrong in that scenario.  Since it has blown up on facebook, I would start by talking to your brother.  You can apologize for the comment about excluding her from all other gatherings.  But, make it clear that you had planned this trip to spend time with your friend and nephew and had budgeted for a certain amount of money.  You can also express your discomfort with taking a child that you do not know well on a trip.  You can suggest an outing or get together in the future with the whole family to make amends and apologize to gf too for losing your temper. I also would pull back on paying for the family trips at least on your side of the family.  There is a sense of entitlement and a case of \"no good deed goes unpunished.\"", "NTA she can by-proxy gold dig on someone else", "She\u2019s asking for wife privileges", "ESH except the kids. She's being entitled and demanding, but you are pusposely excluding a child who had nothing to do with it, and have promised to continue doing so in the future. That's fucked up, and tbh it sounds like you also have a weird grudge against her bc your bestie isn't your sil anymore", "ESH she was wrong to bring it up like that when I suspect it would have been less harshly received/rejected if she had privately asked you if her son could be invited. That said, your reaction was so over the top and unnecessary. She messed up and now you are banning her from all family events? Really?", "You're NTA, you don't owe her child anything. \nBut maybe you were a little emotional and at one point kind of mean. In your rant, you excluded the kid from any future monetary gifts and or activities you will invite your nephew too, a kid who, as you said yourself, you don't know yet, who likely will be part of your family one day and might have grown close to you over time - who knows. Telling the mom off for her entitlement is what she deserved, but including her child - a 5 year old kid!!! - in your lecture was unnecessary and kind of cruel.", "Exactly. Also, I was thinking that the next step would be for her to demand that OP uninvite their best friend (Ex SIL) because GF's son is so young and needs his mother and it would be uncomfortable for her to have to deal with the Ex.", "Don't you hate parents do that?", "I think that\u2019s why I was so shocked. Had she approached me differently i wouldn\u2019t mind trying to accommodate or include them if they wanted to pay & go. I think more of what made me mad is that \u201csomeone\u201d told the kid and he\u2019s been crying. My nephew hasn\u2019t even been told we\u2019re going yet so he didn\u2019t.", "\ud83d\ude02 I will admit I do have some anger issues. It was just the first thing that came to mind. I do feel bad as I never want to make a child sad or feel not welcome BUT I don\u2019t want to be around the mom. This honestly has made me view her different & I lost any respect I had for her. To this moment I\u2019ve not had any issues with her\u2026 thought she was nice enough!", "I agree, that remark was going too far.\n\nBut she had no reason to invite the GF's son. The trip is for the OP and her best friend (and the friend's son).", "Well, Mickey Mouse isn't cheap and neither is your brother's GF's son.", "Yes I think maybe I did go too far. By excluding her not the kid but I know they go hand in hand. I just couldn\u2019t see myself wanting to do or be around her at least in the foreseeable future.", "Not excluding him just not comfortable taking a child I don\u2019t know for a week to a far off place. That\u2019s why I\u2019m taking my BF/ ex SIL because I don\u2019t want to watch a small child alone for a long period. Children that young get homesick easily as well. So inviting him means I\u2019d have to also pay& invite The new GF.", "OP isn't excluding anyone purposefully. She is taking family (nephew) and best friend on vacation. Shes not required to invite anyone. Brothers gf and her child are not her family (she barely knows them) and are demanding a free vacation. Brother should have nipped this in the bud when gf got wind of it...he just doesn't want to be the 'bad guy'...", "She's excluding her BFs new girlfriend and her son...who she doesn't know. That completely fair and reasonable. ESPECIALLY SINCE SHES SHAMING HER INTO BUYING A TICKET TO DISNEY FOR HER SON. This has nothing to do with that - GF is pissed that his ex gets to go and she can't. It's OPs money to do what she wants and she wants to be with her childhood friend and nephew. She's NTA here.", "If he's crying, it's because someone promised him something that wasn't theirs to promise.   That's not on you.   She's weaponizing her kid against you.", "This is why I say ESH.", "Wait, she wanted you to just take her kid by himself? Heck no. That's nuts.\n\nNTA", "She didn\u2019t say but I\u2019m not taking some random child on a week vacation so therefor she would have to go.
