They\u2019ve been together for around 9 ish months. They\u2019re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I\u2019ve only met John a handful of times.

We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.\n\nI invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal.

Just because \u201cyou have the means\u201d does not mean you have to share it. It\u2019s a beautifully generous thing you\u2019re doing for your nephew and friend.

Had this new gf and son been around years upon years I would have perhaps said it would have been nice to atleast ask.", "NTA. You can do nice things for your nephew without having to pay for the kids of whoever your brother is dating at that time.", "NTA. No one should assume someone else is going to pay for their child to go anywhere, much less an overnight trip. If he loves Disney, she can take him.

But coming at you, guns hot, making demands of what you should be doing?   From someone you barely know?   OH HELL NO.

Good for you for putting an immediate stop to her entitled behavior.", "NTA. You don't need to be responsible for a kid even your brother has known for less than a year.

She's not married to your brother, and even if she were, you don't have to pay for him to go to disney.

Wow, what an entitled brat your brothers GF is. It's your money, do whatever you want with it. Don't make yourself uncomfortable for them. You're totally in the right to tell her how it is - she's not family, you barely know her and her son, and she's not welcome to just invite herself and her son to family holidays, ESPECIALLY if she's not paying. Good lord, when did people become so damn entitled that they think other people deserve them whatever they want. \n\nI hope your family comes around to the fact that they're being dumb idiots and your boyfriend's girl is acting like a spoiled brat.

You are most certainly not excluding or isolating her child!  I'd distance my self her ASAP.", "NTA.

Leave Entitled Ethel at home.", "NTA\n\nThe entitlement is truly shocking. \n\nShe really expects you to gift her $2K? \n\nYou maybe took it too far with saying you would deliberately exclude her but to have the nerve to demand it of you to begin with is completely outrageous.", "ESH - I think the only part where you were the AH is where you made it a point to tell her that you'll exclude her and her kids from future family gatherings.   Why do you get to do that?  You get to decide for the whole family if she's accepted or not?  Did you ask the others for permission to run their relationships?    You were very cruel.    \n\nYou could have told her the trip was planned before you ever met her or just told her she was out of line for the entitled mentality (which I agree was a super AH move on her part) or some other lesser dickish way of brushing her off.\n\nKindness to new additions to the family is free.", "NTA. They are just one step up from random strangers to you at this point. You can't invite the whole world and his grandmother (or nephew) to Disney. Talk about being entitled!", "Wow, I'm guessing she carries those gigantic balls of hers in a separate bag!  Sure, bitch to your boyfriend's sister, whom you don't really know very well, about her not getting your child a $2k gift trip.  The entitlement is monumental!", "NTA.", "NTA", "Changing my verdict to ESH.  I missed the part about you excluding them from all future gatherings.  You could have made you point using civility but instead you lost your temper.  Not a good look for you.\n\nN t a for not including your brother's current girlfriend's kid.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of mothers around here complaining that their kids aren't being treated as a bio relative of their boyfriend's family.  Like wtf?\n\nEven if these women treated their boyfriend's parents like their MIL and FIL (which I suspect they don't), no one is at all obligated to treat these women's kid equal to their own grandchildren or nephew.\n\nIt's hella jealousy.\n\nNow I think you didn't have to blow up at her - you could have just said it never occurred to you to invite her son because he isn't close to you.  Followed by, you have no intention of inviting him.", "ESH. There's no problem with only taking your nephew. Your money, your choice. It might be different if they were around long enough or married such that you were needing my the dynamics of a blended family, but that's not what is happening here.  Also your family shouldn't tell you what to do with your money. I do think you went too far in blowing up and planning to exclude this kid from all family gatherings in the future. Kind of feels like you were spoiling for a fight.", "ESH. \n\nIf you hadn't blown up at her the way you did, it would've been NTA.\n\nYou were def NTA for not inviting the GF's son. If you were inviting your brother too, and not the GF and son, I can understand the complaints. But you were only inviting the brother's ex and son \u2014 your best friend and son. Why should you include the other son?\n\nBut by saying you would \"exclude the GF from all future family gatherings\" was going way way too far. If she's regularly seeing yr brother, she's going to become more and more a part of family gatherings. Yes, maybe the relationship will not last. But maybe it will. I think your threat to exclude her from family gatherings was the wrong way to approach it.\n\nNow there's all this fallout...not sure how to resolve. You could apologize for going too far, but explain this is a trip for you and your best friend; so why should someone else's kid be included?", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't understand why the gf would think her son should be included. I would not offer to take the gf's son even if someone else pays his way.  You and this boy are virtually strangers to each other.  So many things could go wrong in that scenario.  Since it has blown up on facebook, I would start by talking to your brother.  You can apologize for the comment about excluding her from all other gatherings.  But, make it clear that you had planned this trip to spend time with your friend and nephew and had budgeted for a certain amount of money.  You can also express your discomfort with taking a child that you do not know well on a trip.  You can suggest an outing or get together in the future with the whole family to make amends and apologize to gf too for losing your temper.

Where does she even have the nerve to come off? This is unreal this can\u2019t be real. Are there people really like this?", "Nta.....they've not been dating long, you don't really know her or the kid. Maybe if they were married it would be different but at this point just no. I don't get these entitled people. I'd feel so weird if someone I didn't know that well offered to pay for such an expensive vacation for me and my kid.", "Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s not even like brother was invited only ex SIL and nephew so why would she or her kid go?  Maybe if her actual boyfriend was going but otherwise why would she tag along with her boyfriend ex wife and kid?  Very weird and I honestly do not understand everyone else\u2019s responses from that bizarre-land family and their friends.", "Yes posted yesterday I think.", "I guess I\u2019ll take everyone\u2019s kids lol. I think she wanted her son for sure. I\u2019m not sure if she thought it out but how she worded it was more based on how he \u201cfelt\u201d. Though I wouldn\u2019t take a strangers child on a week vacation so she would have to go. She is in not the best financial space atm so that would mean I would have to cover her as well. \nShe asked my mom for gas money so that\u2019s how I know she isn\u2019t doing too hot /:", "I\u2019m assuming since she knew them two were going that it would just be fair for us to also include her child in the mix. Though myself, my husband,& ex SIL would not be watching John. Sooooo if it played out she would have to attend. Total mind fuck. I think she just thought we were so well off that adding 2 additional people wouldn\u2019t hurt. Clearly wasn\u2019t aware of how much it actually cost to go\u2026 \nI\u2019ve always included her child anytime I was around both my nephew & him though not a lot. But we did go get frozen yogurt one day to the park which I took them both and paid with the mom.", "Is your brother even going on the trip? Or is it just you and your best friend with her son who also happens to be your nephew? Because that's even crazier if she thinks you are supposed to take her with her boyfriend's ex-wife!", "No he\u2019s not. We\u2019re going when my friend has him. On her week", "the balls of everyone thinking they have a say in how you choose to spend your money\n\nNTA", "WOW! So did she expect for you to take her on vacation with her boyfriend's ex-wife? I don't even know this girl and I know that's a bad idea! Or did she expect you to just take the kid? Maybe she's trying to get a week off? Either way that's just too entitled! You don't owe her a thing! NTA"]}
