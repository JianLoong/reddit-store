{"id": 4259, "submission_id": "zg2gxc", "title": "AITA for pulling out of decorating a wedding a week before it?", "selftext": "Hired in July by the bride and her mom. The bride mentioned her future MIL is wanting to do a dessert table which the bride didn't want but obliged. I sent her a quote but she didn't have the funds to pay the $800 deposit at the time so I broke payments up into smaller ones. She missed her final payment due date. Instead of backing out of the wedding as my contract states I can, I adjusted the decor services to fit into what she'd paid which was half of the total cost ($1600 for 200 guest wedding). We (the coordinator/bride/myself) thought the MIL was just providing desserts. However, she had planned to also decorate the table. My contract states that any decor aside from what's contracted through me needs to be approved by me. The MIL didn't know and said she was just doing what her son and the bride asked although the bride told me in a recorded meeting that she really didn't want it. The theme is XMas/Winter with navy tablecloths but the table the MIL is doing is gold on gold/gaudy. The bride didn't like the table and wanted everything to flow but is too scared to tell the groom or MIL. We had a call with the MIL and she reluctantly agreed for me to review the decor she had and figure what could be used that flows the rest of the decor. The groom (not on any contract nor paid any funds based on what the bride said) goes off saying that I was only hired a month ago (which it's been 5 months) and that his mother's table would not be touched. I explained that I was contracted by the bride and her mother to do a job and was willing to compromise with his mom to ensure a seamless theme. He replied it's his mom's table as is or he would get another decorator. I reminded him that the funds paid are nonrefundable and it's in his best interest for us to try and compromise since it's so close to the wedding. We settled on leaving it as is but the coordinator and I would be relocating it on the room so it doesn't take away from the main cake table. Afterwards he sends a screenshot of where he wants the table to be next to the cake and stated it wasn't negotiable and to let him know if another decorator was needed. The bride hasn't spoken up for what she wants and what she and I agreed to do. He has tried to fire the coordinator before and stated that either the bride fire her or there wouldn't be a wedding. The bride's mother intervened and said no one that she and her daughter paid for would be fired. But after the recent convo, I just can't take the drama he and his mom bring. I'm 5 weeks pregnant and it's too much. I don't want to leave the bride high and dry. The coordinator is also wanting to back out because of the same reason...stress caused by the groom's antics and disrespect. I'm willing to rent them the decor from the same $800 so there's no complete waste of money but i think I'd be putting myself in a stressful situation by being on site and around the groom.", "created_utc": 1670514076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg2gxc/aita_for_pulling_out_of_decorating_a_wedding_a/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have tried to compromise and work with them, but they have not been cooperative. Your health and well-being, as well as that of your unborn child, should be your top priority. It is not worth it to put yourself in a stressful situation for a job, especially when the clients are not respecting your boundaries. You are justified in backing out of the wedding and offering to rent the decor to the bride so that she can still have the decorations she wants.", "I think you know you're NTA and the groom and his mother are.\n\nIt sucks for the bride but all you can do is protect your own interests.

Let everyone know that in this time frame that clarity requires that all communication go through one channel, whether that is MOB or the coordinator, is up to you. But one communication channel is critical to a succesful wedding.\n\nBlock the groom, don't read his communications, limit your contact to the contracted party.

That\u2019s like bringing your own food to a restaurant and then acting like the restaurant served it to you. That decor directly represents you as a vendor.", "NTA aside from the fact that contractually you have a perfect right to back out, staying away from messy family dramas and not letting yourself get drawn into them because you feel bad for the bride is absolutely the sensible thing to do, especially seeing as you're pregnant and probably not feeling your best to begin with. That said, if you have anywhere on, say, your website where clients can leave reviews, I would close submissions for a little while if you're able to. The groom/his family sound like they could be the type to try and blame the whole situation on you and attempt to tank your professional reputation", "NTA if you really feel bad you can always hang around on standby for them to come begging back last minute but you really should not bother. If you\u2019re concerned that they\u2019re not getting enough warning, send one final message to the bride and **brides mom especially** explaining the terms in brief, give a tight but reasonable timeline for them to give you their final answer, and be clear that ANY PUSHBACK AT ALL from groom or MIL means you\u2019re gone, right then and there, all decorating responsibilities on them. \n\nBut really, just back out.

Its their wedding too, and you don't need to involve yourself in that discussion. YTA for that part.

Talk to the people whose name is on the contract. Tell them that being flexible with their event has caused hours of extra work for you, not to mention stress. So you are holding them to the original terms of the contract. They either need to pay the final payments or accept that by not doing so, the contract is terminated and they forfeit all previous payments. \n\nThat\u2019s it.
