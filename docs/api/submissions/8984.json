I do it, as i always have. \n\nBut im struggling to keep up with everything now that my youngest is bigger. I asked him to please pick up after himself, take his trash away, pick up his clothes off the floor in the morning, not leave every single thing he uses scattered all over the houe. He basically said thats my job, he works i do everything else and if i cant do my job he will find someone who will. \n\nSo i admit i was feeling brave and decided to just bag up everyhing he left around the house and hide it and tell him that i dumped it all. It didnt go as planned, his laptop was left by the kitchen sink, with kids, not a good place to leave it, so i hid it in the bag with everything else. \n\nHe went crazy screaming at me what the hell have i done with it, when i told him i dumped it because even though i begged him to plese help me by not leaving his things everywhere and he refused. He laughed at me, calling me a stupid daft woman and sked me when am i going to just accept tht this is my job.\n\n I was hoping when he seen how full the bag of stuff i had at the end of the day, that he would realise how much mess he is leaving for me and maybe change.

You don\u2019t get that. You\u2019re marriage is a partnership and is failing ON HIS PART. He works from home, 35hrs a week?? That\u2019s not very much work. He absolutely has time to help you with the housework of the place you BOTH live in. It is his home as well, he can damn well do his bit. You already have your hands full.\n\nI have these rules in place in my house: if the clothes aren\u2019t in the basket, they don\u2019t get washed, if his rubbish isn\u2019t in the bin, it doesn\u2019t binned by me, If you don\u2019t say please or thank you, it doesn\u2019t get done (this goes both ways for us). \n\nMy husband has adhd, so sometimes he genuinely forgets to do these things, but he understands that if house is messy and he doesn\u2019t have clean clothes, it\u2019s his own fault. \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t respect you, he doesn\u2019t want to understand or try. He\u2019s boxed you in this life and trapped you, because with 3 kids, and one being disabled, he has made you all dependant on him, and made it harder for you to leave. That\u2019s why he acts like this, because he believes there is no way out for you. You didn\u2019t throw his stuff away, you faked a situation to get him to realise the impact of his neglect, it backfired a bit, but clearly he has no interest in talking things out or taking you seriously. If he cared about his shit, he wouldn\u2019t leave it everywhere like trash to be thrown out. \n\nNTA.\n\nAlso, please consider trying to find a friend or family member to stay with.

If you continue to push back, mark my words, this man will hit you\u2026\u2026 well\u2026. He might bump into you at first, or shove you, but it will get there. \nLet me ask you something, when you had these babies, how much did he help? Be honest with yourself here\u2026.", "I'm a breadwinner parent who works from home and my husband is the keeper of the home. He brings me food and takes away my dishes and gets me tea when I ask him to. He does all the cooking and most of the cleaning and childcare, because that is his job in the household. And I am admittedly a distractible slob who leaves my stuff everywhere.\n\nHowever, at the end of my workday I'm a parent too. I do things with my kiddo and make sure he gets a break. I have some chores that I do (and monitor the kiddo doing her chores) because everyone in a household should contribute. I don't expect him to pick up my messes, though I'm grateful when he helps me. And all the little things he does like pop in mid-afternoon sometimes with a little snack I didn't realise I needed, I am grateful. I am fully aware that he indulges me, and when he's too busy to do it, I fend for myself.\n\nI make sure he has his own spending money and his own time for hobbies and vacations because keeping a home even with one half grown kiddo is real work. I can't imagine how you have time to recharge with three little ones and disabilities in the mix too. You need some time to call your own. You are in a hard time of life and neither of you get to be so lazy.\n\nOP you deserve better. Your kids deserve a primary caregiver who is not worn to the bone and constantly frustrated. You need your husband to understand that his behaviour isn't sustainable. And you need to start setting aside money for a lawyer and for your own self care and preservation. You can't quit the job of mother, but you can quit being a wife. You need to be sure you can financially survive a divorce because that is where his behaviour is taking you. Sooner or later you will snap under the pressure or he will leave because he doesn't truly value you.\n\nOnce you have a plan for how to navigate a divorce, you can try couples counseling. But don't start by working on your marriage. Start by working on your independence, because only by being secure will you have the power in the relationship to demand change. The passive aggressive way you tried to communicate about this just shows how little power you feel you have in this marriage. He needs you more than you need him. Find your power.", "He might not be physically abusive, but he is verbally and mentally abusing you. There's a chance it may escalate to physical abuse. He doesn't see you as a partner, he is using you as a bangmaid. He doesn't even work full time and has no commute. Chores should be split 50/50 and he needs to take his share of child care. Stop doing anything for him. Stop picking up after him, stop cleaning his dishes, stop feeding him at all. He'll eventually get hungry enough to make himself a sandwich or get his own takeout. \n\nPlease open your eyes and stop being so naive. This is not a good man.", "Dear OP, please take the time to look into what emotional abuse is, and what financial abuse is. All abusers escalate, even if some don\u2019t ever get to the point of hitting their target, most do eventually. They use the \u2018honeymoon cycle\u2019 where they will act kindly for a bit between bouts of abuse to mentally trap their victims. Do you want your children to think getting screamed is normal? Do you want your daughter to think she will have to grow up cleaning up after a grown man like he is a child, and have him call her names? \n\nAbusers are very kind at first, but ramp up the abuse the more enmeshed the victim is in their life. Moving in, engagement, marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, loss of financial independence, social isolation are all times the abuser will escalate. It is common for abusers to sabotage birth control in order to trap their victims. If they think the victim is at risk of leaving, they will slather love and attention on them until they feel secure again.\n\nPlease consider getting out, I don\u2019t think you are safe there", "Please... he may not hit you, he may never hit you but he's STILL absolutely abusive.
