He brings me food and takes away my dishes and gets me tea when I ask him to. He does all the cooking and most of the cleaning and childcare, because that is his job in the household. And I am admittedly a distractible slob who leaves my stuff everywhere.\n\nHowever, at the end of my workday I'm a parent too. I do things with my kiddo and make sure he gets a break. I have some chores that I do (and monitor the kiddo doing her chores) because everyone in a household should contribute. I don't expect him to pick up my messes, though I'm grateful when he helps me. And all the little things he does like pop in mid-afternoon sometimes with a little snack I didn't realise I needed, I am grateful. I am fully aware that he indulges me, and when he's too busy to do it, I fend for myself.\n\nI make sure he has his own spending money and his own time for hobbies and vacations because keeping a home even with one half grown kiddo is real work. I can't imagine how you have time to recharge with three little ones and disabilities in the mix too. You need some time to call your own. You are in a hard time of life and neither of you get to be so lazy.\n\nOP you deserve better. Your kids deserve a primary caregiver who is not worn to the bone and constantly frustrated. You need your husband to understand that his behaviour isn't sustainable. And you need to start setting aside money for a lawyer and for your own self care and preservation. You can't quit the job of mother, but you can quit being a wife. You need to be sure you can financially survive a divorce because that is where his behaviour is taking you. Sooner or later you will snap under the pressure or he will leave because he doesn't truly value you.\n\nOnce you have a plan for how to navigate a divorce, you can try couples counseling. But don't start by working on your marriage. Start by working on your independence, because only by being secure will you have the power in the relationship to demand change.

Find your power.", "He might not be physically abusive, but he is verbally and mentally abusing you. There's a chance it may escalate to physical abuse. He doesn't see you as a partner, he is using you as a bangmaid. He doesn't even work full time and has no commute. Chores should be split 50/50 and he needs to take his share of child care. Stop doing anything for him. Stop picking up after him, stop cleaning his dishes, stop feeding him at all. He'll eventually get hungry enough to make himself a sandwich or get his own takeout. \n\nPlease open your eyes and stop being so naive. This is not a good man.", "Dear OP, please take the time to look into what emotional abuse is, and what financial abuse is. All abusers escalate, even if some don\u2019t ever get to the point of hitting their target, most do eventually. They use the \u2018honeymoon cycle\u2019 where they will act kindly for a bit between bouts of abuse to mentally trap their victims. Do you want your children to think getting screamed is normal? Do you want your daughter to think she will have to grow up cleaning up after a grown man like he is a child, and have him call her names? \n\nAbusers are very kind at first, but ramp up the abuse the more enmeshed the victim is in their life. Moving in, engagement, marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, loss of financial independence, social isolation are all times the abuser will escalate. It is common for abusers to sabotage birth control in order to trap their victims.

If i, a clumsy idiot in my 20s who cut myself on broken glass just yesterday while washing up, can do it, then so can your 40yo husband.\n\nMaybe our jobs could be different (i work in software) but i highly doubt he doesn\u2019t have a few minutes here and there to, I don\u2019t know, help out his struggling wife? It seems like he\u2019s not doing anything because he\u2019s sexist and he wants to duck the responsibility because \u201cit\u2019s a woman\u2019s thing and I work\u201d\n\nIf I\u2019ve heard one thing about marriage, it\u2019s that it should be both of you vs the world. He wants you to contribute an unfair amount of time to your kids while he works less than full time and, presumably, does nothing, leaving his struggling wife to deal with everything. He insults you when you stand up for yourself and threatens to leave you, the implication here being that you\u2019re meaningless to him.\n\nOP, is this what you want for the rest of your life? Putting so much love and care into your children, you must be exhausted :(\n\nLooking from the outside in, maybe the offer of him finding someone else doesn\u2019t sound so bad after all\n\nTake care OP", "So you're treated as a sl*ve and you're essentially a single mom of 4...\n\nHave you considered how much easier it would be on you to just be a single mother of 3 and lose some real useless weight?  Because even if you don't see it \n now, you will eventually realize this.\n\nI realized it in my case and releasing useless weight was the best decision i ever made.\n\nThat whole \"you're my wife so i own you and you have to do everything for me because im lazy and the man of the house\" is 1950s dellusional.\nThis is why women demanded the right to vote and the right to equality. Does he realize its illegal? Do you?", "In the UK 35 (and possibly other places) hours a week is a full time job. 7 hours a day with an hour for lunch in the middle. And 4-6 weeks holiday.\n\nBut OPs husband is a lazy asshole.", "Do what's best for yourself and you're children. When you got married it's supposed to be a partnership. 50/50 split. He has manipulated and controlled you for to long. I would get a lawyer and get all you're ducks in a row, then sit him down and tell him what you need from him for this marriage to continue.", "**Financial abuse**\n\n**Emotional abuse**\n\n**Verbal abuse**\n\n**Psychological abuse**\n\nThose are just four types of non-physical abuse that I read loud and clear from your post.\n\nOP - you are in an abusive relationship, one your son's will learn and emulate if you don't get out NOW.\n\nNTA and it's not your job to raise him where his mom did wrong.", "Jesus christ she's been with this man since she was 19. No wonder she doesn't realize how abusive he is. He's been grooming her for this \"job\" since she was a teenager.", "Sixth: the Silent Treatment is a manipulation technique used by abusers"]}
