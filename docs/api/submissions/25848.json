My dad always hated his mom, my ex-grandma. She ignored him when he was little, and that caused Dad to have big mommy issues. It's important to note that ex-grandma and Dad had avoided each other like the freaking plague for all of their lives until June of 2022.\n\nIt started when Mom and Dad, who used to go out together, began distancing themselves from each other. My brother (16M) and I (17F) brushed off the feeling that something was wrong until the 20th of October, the night before my bday. We were chatting about my bday trip to Universal Studios, which I had been excited about until my brother asked why the family had so much tension. Dad decided it was the PERFECT time to announce his infidelity to us just minutes before my bday, causing my mom to become angry at his excellent timing. I always had a hint he was cheating. That's when we discovered Mom had known for months and tried to protect the family by not telling us. My bday sucked, even though Mom made my bday as good as possible with what she could, and I couldn't be more grateful for her. Dad didn't care. I tried not to cry, but the second my head hit the pillow at night, I let the waterworks begin. It finally made sense why Dad came home late, turned off his location on all devices, and spent less time with us.\n\nIt turned out that he cheated on my mom because my ex-grandma persuaded him to leave us. Mom always respected ex-grandma, which is why it was an odd betrayal. I'm assuming she may have a personality disorder. Ex-grandma stupidly defended her previous treatment of Dad, saying it was difficult for her to raise him and other crap like that. Dad accepted this and they reconciled, and she made him believe he was no longer in need of his wife now that he had the mom he always dreamed of.\n\nMom and Dad eventually settled on divorce. That shattered me. They filed a month ago, and Dad moved out fast. Apparently, he got an apartment without telling us, only providing us with the info that he would be gone ASAP. I haven't spoken to him since he left. He asked to hang out, but I didn't want to. I refuse to talk with or see him because I have no idea how he can be so unashamed and not embarrassed by what he'd done. He has permanently broken our bond and hasn't even apologized.\n\nThis is where I may be the AH. I'm starting to let go of him and only have him as a memory now that I've established that I could live happily without him. It sucks knowing I won't get proper fatherly love unless I want to be manipulated to think that my mom was in the wrong, which he had done before, but I don't think about him often. It makes me feel guilty, the fact that I don't care to talk to him because I've known him all my life. I don't plan on seeing him any time soon, or maybe ever again.\n\nSo, AITA for letting him go so quickly?", "created_utc": 1693387254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1659qdq/aita_for_letting_go_of_my_cheating_dad_and/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think it was quickly. You have probably doing that unconsciously for years now. Your father didn't just turn an asshole overnight. I'm sure he always been an ass just hiding it for convenience. Good riddance. Sorry for having such a bad experience. But you are not obligated to have a relationship with him if you don't want to. Don't feel bad about it. It wasn't your fault in any way he did what he did. You don't have to endorse his behaviour in any way or shape.", "NTA.  You have not let go of him - he has let go of you and your family.  He is obviously easily manipulated and it is no doubt a skill he will be using on you.  You are right to keep him out of your life.", "NTA\n\nHe cheated on his wife, lied to all of you, ruined you bday and he doesn\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t want to hang out with him?

You can be separated and still be a good father/mother. It seems you have reacted strongly to your parents divorcing. Which is also normal at your age.\n\nIt might have been handled differently at your birthday , but if your father is supporting you and wishing to retain contact with his kids- I think he should get a chance to do that. It is never easy to announce that you want to separate.\n\nEdit: Also- your grandmother does not become \u201eex\u201c grandma just because your parents are not married any more. In addition, if you think that your grandma is the reason your dad cheated on your mom, you are just too naive.", "Thank you, I appreciate this :)"]}
