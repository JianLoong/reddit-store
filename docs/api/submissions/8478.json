Being bright isn't about qualifications.  He excelled in every role and, because he enjoyed it,  worked super hard.  He leaped up the ladder with ease,  and speed, because he's bright.  The same will be true in any field of work.  If your daughter is bright and enjoys her choices,  she'll naturally work hard.  She isn't other people. Others may drop out but she could soar. \n\nOf course because there for her,  and worry about her choices,  but,  support her.", "NTA its understandable to wish she had higher goals and would pursue them at a time when it's going to be the most opportune time for them to do so (going through this with my little brother who wants to go straight into working rather than do college despite having straight up scholarships lined up for him).\n\n Ultimately you're only TA if you talk down to her for her decision.

I think it's normal to have this concern. Also, she's 17? She still has time. Worst case scenario she tries it out for a couple years and has/wants to switch paths. Also normal. \n\nIf it helps put your mind at ease, hairdressers, nail techs, makeup artists also make tips on top of their wages, and most people tip fairly well in this field.

You cannot find it for her no matter what, and she will never thank you for being disappointed in her. \n\nHaving the concern is normal, telling your daughter you're disappointed in her new dream waltzes straight into AH territory.
