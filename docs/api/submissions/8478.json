Being bright isn't about qualifications.  He excelled in every role and, because he enjoyed it,  worked super hard.  He leaped up the ladder with ease,  and speed, because he's bright.  The same will be true in any field of work.  If your daughter is bright and enjoys her choices,  she'll naturally work hard.  She isn't other people. Others may drop out but she could soar. \n\nOf course because there for her,  and worry about her choices,  but,  support her.", "NTA its understandable to wish she had higher goals and would pursue them at a time when it's going to be the most opportune time for them to do so (going through this with my little brother who wants to go straight into working rather than do college despite having straight up scholarships lined up for him).\n\n Ultimately you're only TA if you talk down to her for her decision.

Also normal. \n\nIf it helps put your mind at ease, hairdressers, nail techs, makeup artists also make tips on top of their wages, and most people tip fairly well in this field.

If she can develop a good client base, she can make decent money.\n\nTraveling makeup artists (particularly for weddings) easily charge $100 for bridesmaids and $200 for the bride, so in a manner of 4-5 hours she can make $500.", "People are downvoting this, I think it seems you are taking in the info as it comes. If you believe in your daughter she can thrive in whatever career she chooses. If she chooses a happiness career and doesn't make as much, that's ok too. Also, like you said, she's young. 17 is not the age to set your career in stone, whether she loves it or wants to change further down the line, that's part of growing up. But you should not be disappointed no matter what she chooses.", "Sir my esthetician just opened her own business and hired 3 new employees. The idea its only a minimum wage gig is so close minded.  How about suggesting she minor in business or consider an MBA once she's 30 instead of being disappointed she's not doing what you want.", "I go to an esthetician once a month and pay her about $80 for less than an hour of work. She's making a hell of a lot more per hour than me with my college degree, lol. My esthetician started out renting a room in a building for her stuff, now six years later she uses an entire building with her logo on it and has 2-3 employees. She is booked solid like a month in advance. It can be a really great way to make a living if that's where your passion is.", "Think about it this way, even if she doesn't stick with it, she'll still have a skill that she can use to save herself money. She could save potentially hundreds of dollars a month on services she could give herself.  Hell, my friend is a massage therapist and she trades for other services (massages for herself, haircuts, cupping, etc), saving tons of money due to her training.", "^^^\ud83d\ude4f", "Right? Like my monthly facial is $100 and I tip $25. Plus she does it from her house and makes her own hours. I'm kind of jealous."]}
