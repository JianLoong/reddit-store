He didn\u2019t seem to understand and kept insisting that I should explore \u201calternatives\u201d and he is \u201cnot insecure but jealous\u201d and that \u201cother man are pervs\u201d. This issue keeps coming back and although I always wear a bra to work or in case of a cleavage, he insists I wear one at all times even if I\u2019m in hoodie walking my dog at 7am. I keep explaining that it\u2019s not comfortable with a bra and I don\u2019t care that anyone sees something. \n\nNow here is where I might be the asshole - when my explanations don\u2019t seem to be good enough for him I tend to give up and just say \u201cok\u201d for the conversation to be over.

Besides what I\u2019ve listed above my wife and I agree on the following. \n\n1). Communication. Good communication between two people, both listening and talking is extremely important \n\n2). Compromise. Everything you do, say, or act upon affects your relationship.  The same applies to your partner. Sometimes  compromise is necessary.\n\n3). Concessions  if something is important to you and  also very important to your partner or vise versa, then sometimes concession is necessary. Is wining this argument worth loosing your relationship? \n\n4). Compassion You will need to look at a situation through your partners eyes to understand why they are acting, saying or behaving the way they are. \n\n5). Trust is a wonderful, beautiful and very special feeling second only to love.  Trust is not automatically given. It is earned and is a constant work in progress. You can enjoy having someone\u2019s trust for years, even for eternity.  You can loose all that trust you\u2019ve been enjoying in a split second by making a poor choice.  You will work for years and years to try to re-earn the trust you threw away but that trust you regain will never be same as it was\n\nWe have been married over 40 years, together for 43.

Women are topless all the time and there isn\u2019t a problem.  You can\u2019t have it both ways.

But these are the sort of things that can turn into resentment and kill a relationship.\n\nWhen it's a consideration of personal comfort vs. placating someone's jealousy, it's not about choosing a hill to die on. It's about making sure the relationship is healthy, having a jealous party in a relationship isn't healthy.\n\nIt's hardly something OP can just agree to and forget about if it's causing her pain and discomfort in her day to day life. Nobody should have to experience that because their partner is jealous.", "Ah, you\u2019re a boomer. Makes sense. \n\nTelling your wife she cannot wear something is controlling, get with it. Vice versa. You can give you opinion on the style or whatever but you don\u2019t get to dictate what someone wears and not be labelled as controlling. Get with the times.", "Men have run businesses exploiting women's bodies for centuries and you're going to fault the woman for making it work in a capitalistic society? Real original.  \ud83d\ude44 \n\nAlso, women are allowed to wear whatever they want. You as a male human being do not get to dictate it. You don't get to have an opinion, you're not the one with the boobs. If someone else is sexualizing OP and that makes the BF uncomfortable, he can take that up with the person inappropriately sexualizing OP. Their inability to respect her is not HER problem to fix. \n\nFinally, assuming you mean a stripclub, if y'all want to waste money paying to see something you're never going to touch, go ahead. Pole dancing is a great workout, and can be a ton of fun, why shouldn't a girl capitalize on that? Its not like society has made it easy for us to capitalize elsewhere (hello lack of women in leadership positions,  wage gap, etc). Exploiting people that aim to exploit women's bodies is *chefs kiss* perfection. \n\nAnd those European countries you've named that don't have that problem-- it's not because the women are more modest, it's because the culture has more respect for people than American culture does.", "What would the ramifications be if you chose to divorce him?  Just remember that the grass may look greener on the other side but it usually isn\u2019t", "Ahh more buzz words. Can you have a conversation without using them. You said that I as a man don\u2019t have any right. . .  If I was a woman would it be ok?  Kind of misandrist (Like that?) isn\u2019t it? BTW how long have you been in a committed relationship with the same person? And how\u2019s that working out for you?", "Well, if you look at France where it is illegal for a man to obtain a DNA test to prove or disprove paternity. It jail time and a fine.  Also, you claim that women aren\u2019t in leadership positions but I\u2019ll ask you, how many women are brick layers, how many woman pour asphalt in 100 degree weather?  How about plumbers, electricians who make between 92-150 per hour?  Why aren\u2019t you demanding equality there?  How about teachers?  Should female teachers be laid off and affirmative action be implemented to hire more male teachers?  California tried to dictate via law that corporations licensed to do business in California must have a specific amount of females on the boards in control but it failed miserably and subsequently was ruled unconstitutional.  \n\nWhen you demand equality, then everything needs to be equal.  Wether it be people who work diligently maintaining the sewers, laying asphalt in 100 degree weather, laying bricks, teaching our children or being a CEO if a major corporation.  Equal\n\nAlso, you blame men for the sexualization of breasts but comment women who sexualize themselves on only friends, strip clubs etc as capitalizing to make money.  But if women stopped displaying themselves in a sexualized way, stopped accepting drinks at clubs, stop accepting perks that are only available to women then the demand would diminish but we both know women won\u2019t stop. Women control the sexual aspect of life.  Accept it.", "We are not married - just dating. No ramifications, I\u2019m fully independent and doing well for myself", "Sorry that using big kid words is intimidating to you lmao. The fact that you think \u201ccontrolling \u201c is a buzz word is hilarious, do you not understand what that means?\n\nIt is wrong on both ends.

I hope OP is able to make a decision that in a few years she will not look back and feel like she made the wrong decision", "I have to agree with you. I think it's pretty pathetic there's nobody else agreeing. I completely understand it is her body and she has the ultimate right over it, but your significant others opinion should mean alot to you. You're especially free to do whatever in your own home, but if you know someone is coming over, you should have the decency to cover up better (if exposed). That applies both ways, of course. However, this really seems like an issue that they should've figured out already. It doesn't seem they're willing to compromise anywhere either, thus, they're not going to be compatible. \n\nIn my own personal opinion, I don't care if a woman goes braless as long as it's not clear as day. I also don't want to see a guy's dick buldging through their shorts just because they decided to go commando. If you're blessed and can't help it even when covered up, then there's just not much you can do about that. \n\nOn a different note (side rant), I also think it's a pretty stupid argument that people over sexualize boobs. They are sexual. Do you touch and grope your partners boobs during sex, why? Why do some women prefer their nipples to be played with if it isn't sexual? Why do women show off their own boobs to please others, even if it's for money? (if they truly didn't find them to be sexual then they wouldn't advertise them or they're just hypocrites and not helping anyone). Most guys will say let women go topless, but only because those guys love seeing women's boobs. It isn't about equality for them.", "NTA.
