I think it's funny that she said she can't drive because it's dangerous but it's not dangerous when you drive her everywhere.

Or she needs to consider ubers and public transpo.", "You aren\u2019t your friends personal driver. A professional gets *paid*. \n\nShe can drive her car or call a taxi or uber or move to town where there is  public transport or *call somebody else* to haul her around. NTA for feeling taken advantage of. It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d.", "NTA, Uber, bus, etc. Why would you not charge her for gas when you are the driver, don't let her make you late, you leave so you can be on time, she will either be in the car or she won't.", "NTA\n\nShe needed to hear that. She needs to get over it or accept she'll just stay home.\n\nIf it's dangerous for her to drive it's also dangerous for her to be driven.\n\nShe's not entitled to being driven around.", "Why don\u2019t you just stop driving her? Help her download Uber instead of enabling her", "She's using you, if she has an irrational fear of driving she can call Ubers, nta", "NTA. If she is *that* scared to drive-how did she pass the test to get a drivers license? \nWhy doesn\u2019t she give you gas money?\nIf you are the one driving her around-why is she sometimes late? She\u2019s taking advantage of you.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t drive, that\u2019s not your problem. She can Uber, Lyft, take a cab - whatever. She shouldn\u2019t be dependent on you for rides places.", "You are her taxi service, not her friend.  NTA to stop driving her anywhere.  Let her get an Uber or taxi and start meeting you places.  She'll get tired of the expense and be forced to drive herself.", "NTA. You are not her personal chauffeur.", "NTA\n\nSounds like it was overdue and she needs a reality check. If she wants you to drive everywhere, she needs to be paying gas at a minimum.", "NTA - it sounds like she is not only not dealing with her anxiety at all, but is also disrespectful and maybe not such a 'friend'. If someone is coming to pick me up as a favour, the least I do is ensure I'm ready when they arrive and pitch $ for gas. I would reccomend therapy to work through her fears as they seem irrational. She needs a slap of reality to come to terms with figuring out other means of transportation if not. I wouldn't fret that she hasn't spoken with you, if she has strictly been using you for rides and you've cut her off, sounds par for the course from how you've described her.", "Mild YTA for the way you said it and for calling her pathetic.  You can\u2019t force people to do things if they don\u2019t want to.  You can\u2019t force her to drive and she can\u2019t force you to drive her either. \n\nBut NTA when it comes to not wanting to be in charge of driving someone all the time plus being stuck with the cost of gas.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say yes to driving her everywhere. You can also limit the times you drive her or not drive her at all.  Once her personal chauffeur is not around and she needs to go places, she might get in her car and drive.\n\nAlso, a solution when going out is to get an Uber.  Tell her you would like to have a drink or two and share the cost of the uber.  \n\nSome people will never be able to drive though.  My aunt has been using her family as chauffeurs or riding the bus for over 20 years.  She\u2019d rather work with a bus schedule (one bus every 2 hours) than drive independently.", "NAH\n\nI think you could have been kinder toward her; this fear of driving seems like something she should be discussing with a therapist. There\u2019s being apprehensive about going on the road and then there\u2019s avoiding it entirely.\n\nBut I understand the strain it puts on you and you\u2019re not at all required to continue being her chauffeur.", "NTA. I was going to say you were the AH until you said she\u2019s complaining about not going anywhere. Thats literally like shooting yourself in the foot and being like \u201cwhy do bad things always happen to me??\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 she needs to grow up and get over herself. Maybe get a therapist if thats what it would take.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. She won\u2019t get anywhere in life relying on everyone around her if you had simply refused she would become someone else\u2019s problem. She needs to get tf over its Shes a grown adult.", "NTA\nShe's expecting you to take her places now and she's completely taking advantage of you", "NTA - they\u2019re so many options with Uber and Lyft these days, it\u2019s easy to get anywhere.  I imagine a few ride shares monthly would be less or equal to the cost of a car payment, gas, insurance, brakes, new tires, etc.  She just needs to budget for these rides, like she\u2019d have to budget for the above", "NTA\n\nShe has a license AND she has a car.\n\nShe's anxious, I get that, but the only way to get over it is by practicing.\n\nMaybe she just needs to drive around the block a few times every day and expand when she's ok with that.\n\nBut she has to do *something!* Can't just rely on her friends to drive her everywhere.", "NTA but you could've worded it a bit better imo. Also this sounds like this has been brewing on you for a while, so instead of blowing up , you should have at least have had this conversations long ago. Especially with the gas splitting, and being late! So yeah nta for being mad that you are being taken advantage over, but slight a h for blowing up instead of talking it out.", "NTA. My fianc\u00e9e does not drive, and I love her dearly but it does get annoying at times. It sucks that we don\u2019t have great public transport here in the USA, but needing to drive is a fact of life and if your friend can\u2019t get over that then she needs to make other arrangements to get around. You are not her taxi, and at the very least she should pay you for gas.", "So you're a free driver for someone with their own car and licence.  NTA for saying something,  soft AH for how you broached the subject. \nYou're not being paid, and she is taking advantage of your friendship. The lateness, the always being DD and the comment about not going anywhere, smack of entitlement especially when no gas is being paid to you and no gratitude. If she's not going to use the car use get her to put you on her car insurance and use her car at the very least so she pays for gas.\nShe may well be too anxious to drive, but that's no reason not to appreciate all the favours OP is doing for her.", "NTA. She has the capacity and resources to drive. While I agree that no one wants a scared or nervous driver on the road, it also is not your responsibility to be her chauffeur. She needs to sort out her anxieties so that she can provide for herself without being a hassle to others. Rather than just leave her to her own devices, though, maybe offer to give her driving lessons or practice to help her overcome her fear. Calling her pathetic was not a kind thing to say to a friend.", "If it's so dangerous, isn't being a passenger JUST as dangerous? If it's so dangerous, isn't she a bad friend for forcing you to take such a risk for her convenience?\n\nNTA. While I think you went too far calling her pathetic, you aren't an AH for telling her to get over it. She's not taking an equitable position for all of the traveling you do together (paying for gas, offering to pay an uber for a night out, etc.) and she needs to stop taking advantage", "NTA. It\u2019s just as dangerous to ride in a car as it is to drive. The only way she\u2019ll drive is if everyone stops being her chauffeur. She just needs to practice. Tell her to start by taking a short trip.  Drive around the block. Then drive up to a close shop like a convenience store. Keep going s little bit further until she\u2019s used to it. Offer to ride with her if she needs support.", "NTA and that is coming from a 28 year old in the USA who also can\u2019t drive.\n\nI have a lot of general anxiety around driving, but also a panic disorder that I believe would genuinely make me an unsafe person to be driving.\n\nThe difference is I don\u2019t make that other people\u2019s problem. Many friends are happy to pick me up for things a lot of the time and I\u2019m very grateful and make that extremely clear. I ALWAYS offer gas money (in advance if I ask them to drive me, on the ride if they offered on their own without me saying anything), I never complain if they say they can\u2019t drive me, and I expect that this means I may not be invited to some things or may need to often pay the price of Ubers and such. It is my problem to deal with, not theirs just because they can drive and I can\u2019t.\n\nYour friend is acting very entitled and unfairly using you.", "NTA. \n\nI get that people think OP was a bit harsh, but it sounds like this was long overdue. The friend either needs to pay OP back for all the gas and complications, put on the big kid pants and work through their own issues, or sell their car, and use that money to invest in Ubers and public transit.", "NTA. I have this exact fear. Though I got my permit two years ago, I'm just now making strides in successfully learning how to drive and I'm about to get my license right before my permit expires. But I would never want someone making sacrifices to accommodate me like you do for her. Maybe recommend she take a driving improvement course?", "NTA, she's an adult and needed to hear that. She needs to figure out how to get places or overcome her fears. If it's so dangerous, why is she willing to make you her sacrificial lamb? She should at the very least be paying for gas. Or having you drive her car. Theres walking, bikes, electric bikes for sure, Uber, lyft. Perhaps you could've been nicer, but she's been taking advantage of you.", "Ugh, NTA.\n\nI'm in my 30s, and have a friend who has never driven and states she will never drive. We've been friends a long, long time. If there is ever a group get-together, we have to coordinate who will pick her up and take her home. Even to dinners and nights out that SO's aren't really invited, we invite her wife so none of us have to drive her. \n\nI love her, but I've been driving her around since I was 16 and am frankly tired of it. The whole group is. Your friend is an adult, and needs to sort out her own transportation.", "EDIT: okay geez, changing to ESH. She is an AH for making you late, not contributing to gas and overall not seeming grateful, but you also crossed a line by calling her pathetic for her fear. \n\nI mean, you\u2019re partially right, but you were a real dick about it. If she\u2019s terrified of driving *then she should not be behind the wheel because she will put herself and others at risk*. You absolutely don\u2019t have to drive her everywhere but you have no right to insult her.\n\nI would apologize but stand but explain how it affects you being her cab. Either she contributes to gas or she needs to find an alternative method of transportation", "NTA\n\nHer not driving is whatever. She also is a lousy inconsiderate passenger. If she isn't pitching in for gas or at the very least helping navigate, what's the point in her being in your car?", "YTA - you can refuse to be her chaueffeur without being an asshole about it.\n\nThere\u2019s public transportation, Lyft, Uber, etc. Tell her to find another option", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or, if you're going to a movie or club, she can pay the entry fee for you. If you want to drink, why not both of you take a cab/uber and split the cost?

Not because of not wanting to drive her places, that's entirely your prerogative. But you don't need to call her pathetic. Many people can't drive for a wide variety of medical reasons.

I live in walking distance of most things including my work and I take public transit a ton. I budget out rideshares like Ubers for bigger trips on the weekend. I coordinate carpools in advance and make sure not to rely on certain people too often.

You\u2019re paying for the license, the car, the insurance, the gas and the car to be maintained for nothing.\n\nNot driving is perfectly ok as long as you\u2019re independent and not depending on anyone else to take you where ever you want to go.", "Your friend doesn't drive.

Otherwise you wouldn't have passed a test. You have a phobia now, but there are therapies for that.

I always talked about being too distracted and not being able to respond fast enough, but the struggle to take everything in and respond is something that I never thought of. \n\nI took my driving licence 22 years ago. After getting it I tried with an old car my dad was very sure that was safe but I wasn't feeling it. I didn't want a new car, I just wanted a different used car that didn't feel like a tin can and whose stick wasn't at my breast height, and we could've afforded it. So I gave up and never drove again.\n\nWhen last year I was diagnosed with adhd many things started to make sense to me and with meds and neurofeedback I was able to buy a moped that I'm now dependent on. It was an easier step cause I already rode bycicles and I know it's weird cause 2 wheels are less safe than 4, but, if it makes any sense to other people, with the moped I know how much space I fill around my body, while with the car I don't.  \n\n\nAnyway, to go back to OP question: you are **NTA**, when I didn't have a way of getting to places I didn't harrass my friends, if they offered I would have them drive me, otherwise I either wouldn't go to the place we were supposed to go, or just get there with a taxi (the former more than the latter). I almost never begged them to leave early if they didn't feel like it and in general we are not big drinkers so no problem there.  \nIt was my problem if I couldn't drive, not theirs.
