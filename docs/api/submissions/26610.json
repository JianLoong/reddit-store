This can be a big responsibility if you don't have the financial flexibility to take on the full payment.''\n\nThe risk you would be taking on at 19 is way too high. Also im unsure if any bank would even let you be a co-signer as they would surely want some guarantee they can get their money back if your parents were to stop paying for whatever reason.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Don't do this! **Never** co-sign anything for anyone unless you are 100% comfortable with **you** being on the hook for **all** of the payments and **none** of the benefits.\n\nIt's *beyond* unreasonable for mid-40s parents to expect their teenage son to cosign a mortgage. *Them* cosigning for *your* mortgage would be reasonable (but still unwise) but the other way around is insane.\n\nAnd why on earth can't they buy a house with $120K saved up? That's enough to make a down payment on a $600,000 house: typically, in the US at least, you don't need more than 20% down, and there are programs for first-time home buyers (e.g. FHA loans) that enable much lower down payments, as low as 3.5% depending on their credit score.\n\nFinally, it's odd that -- at age 40-something -- they think they can't get a mortgage loan, but *you* -- at age 19 -- *could*.\n\nDon't do this!", "Nta do not do not sign anything. \n\nI'm a bit surprised that $120k isn't enough for a down payment?

This is crazy", "NTA, if they've really saved that much then they don't need a cosigner. If their credit is really bad then they need to take that $120k and pay off debt first. Don't ever cosign especially for a mortgage, there's too much risk and you'll never be able to get one yourself until this would be paid off.", "What credit could a 19 year old have that would be an acceptable cosignee of a mortgage? Definitely NTA. I think the parents have other motives here. \nDon\u2019t sign , get ready to be on your own.", "No you are definitely not the asshole my friend what do they expect of you. You are just a youngster it sounds like they planned on using you. Get as far away as possible.", "NTA.

Don't let them destroy your credit and future finances.

They WILL count that mortgage payment as your debt when you try to buy a car, get a student loan, rent a place to live, and try to buy a home. In order to not count it you would be required to show 12 months as agreed payments (no lates) and proof your parents had made those without your help. Based on your description of your parents behavior, do you honestly trust them to provide 12 months of bank statements showing they're making the payments? Or do you think maybe they would use that debt to control you?", "NTA, don't do it! It will go on your credit if they don't pay. They're adults. This is incredibly out of line. Make sure they don't forge your signature either.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThe rule is:  You never cosign on a loan for something you do not own, unless you can afford to throw all of the loan amount down a storm drain and never see it again.\n\nDoesn't matter if the people who want you to do it are nice or jerks or family or friends or anybody.  Don't do it.  This is the kind of thing that destroys good relationships and unendurably prolongs bad ones.\n\nETA:  Special scowl for \"What have we been raising you for?\" because I am older than your parents and I can tell you that nobody I know would dream of asking their 19-year-old (19!) to take on such an enormous obligation, in this economy, at the very start of their working life, when they may still be looking at going to school in order to make more money, *and two years after having bought a new car!*\n\nWhat have they been raising you for?  A piggy bank, apparently.  And they are silly enough to think that they can patch the holes in their financial planning with a piggy bank and use that to buy a house!

If they can\u2019t get a mortgage without a co-signer, it\u2019s because their income and down payment are insufficient to get approved for a mortgage. A co-signer would be subjected to the same financial scrutiny as them. So if the bank analyzed your parents finances and determined that they were unlikely to repay, where is the logic in adding you? Forgive my assumption, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re independently wealthy. Before your name gets printed below a signature line, they\u2019re going to scrutinize your bank statements, paystubs, and debt load to determine whether or not you\u2019d be able to pay the mortgage if your parents stop.

With a mortgage, that\u2019s typically 30 years. No matter how hardworking and well-meaning people are, an accident or illness can make it impossible for them to make payments, so the lender comes after the co-signer. And, it uses your debt-to-income ratio up, which makes  renting apartments and financing cars more expensive, if you can do it at all.\n\nThe only time it\u2019s okay to co-sign is when it\u2019s an amount you could easily and gladly pay for a person just getting started who needs a little help building credit. And even then, you need to be careful, because if that person falls behind on debt and doesn\u2019t tell you, late payments on the co-signed loan will mess up your credit.\n\nDo Not Co-Sign.", "OP, check your credit report asap.
