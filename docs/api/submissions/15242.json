Don't feel terrible for saying no. You have zero obligation to give up your space. Sounds like your neighbor might have the 'give an inch, take a mile' attitude. It'll start with 1 car and if that's ok then it'll be 2 and then 3 cars.

Not my problem, I don\u2019t want to be involved. There are other neighbors, other alternatives", "NTA on top of all the valid reasons you've already listed, if you make it easy for them to park a single vehicle there now - it'll turn into 2 when someone visits or they add another car, or need a to make parking a little easier on the other 3 vehicles. Then at holiday's if you have guests you'll potentially have to go ask for a vehicle to be moved. Or if they have guests they'll come ask you for another temporary slot. If they need to do an oil change or work on a car, well your driveway would be the most convenient for that also. I guess what I'm saying is, if this was a short term problem then that'd be one thing - but by the sounds of it this would wind up being a more or less permanent arrangement.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, it's highly unlikely that city police are doing immigration checks. That is typically something the border patrol/immigration would handle. Same reason beat cops aren't doing drug stings.", "NTA: you have no obligation to share your driveway with them. It is their own dumb fault for not buying a home with more parking, or near to public parking. I totally understand and agree with your thinking concerning liabilities and inconveniences.", "NTA.\n\nYour kids play there. That\u2019s reason enough.", "NTA. Your neighbor would not be one either until he refused to accept your answer.\n\nIt sounds like the neighbors and especially the police are assholes - what does it matter if a car is parked in the grass?

If you are concerned about liability, see a lawyer and have them draw up an agreement that says the neighbor can't hold you legally responsible for any damage to their cars because they parked in your driveway.

Add in that the agreement can be cancelled by you at any time for any reason.\n\nThen your neighbor will have a choice, sign the agreement or not.", "YTA. Of course you have the right to say no but yeah I think you\u2019re an asshole for it. The cops coming around regularly, especially in an immigrant family, is traumatizing.

Is it an HOA?", "NTA and you are absolutely correct.", "NTA This whole story just makes me sad for America", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR driveway, not their overflow parking lot. It\u2019s almost guaranteed that if you say yes to one car, more cars will soon show up and they\u2019ll be asking you to accommodate those cars too, or even worse, just helping themselves to more of your driveway space without even asking. It\u2019s a slippery slope you don\u2019t want to get on. They need to solve this situation themselves and your driveway is not the answer.", "NTA", "NTA one of them needs to give up their car. Sorry but they just don\u2019t have the space available and their long term solution should be to other others driveways", "If they have enough space to park a car on the grass, they can get some bags of gravel to turn that into additional parking on their property. I suggest gravel because it is less expensive and more diy friendly as well as more easily removable to regain lawn if kids move out. They just need to check town regulations about how close to the property line they can place the gravel parking spaces. Or they can go to the town and check if it's really illegal to park on their own grass, where I live, there are no laws against that.", "It\u2019s simple they need to expand there drive way ntah", "NTA this really isn\u2019t your problem to solve. They need to get rid of a car or two or buy a house with a bigger drive way.", "NTA. This is their problem, not yours. If they try to park without permission, one warning, then tow. Hell, even put up a sign to that effect - private property, warning that trespassing/parked cars will be towed.", "NTA.  You can offer to rent a parking space to them and draw up a contract.  I certainly wouldn't let them park for free", "NTA. Give an inch they'll take the whole driveway.", "Nta. They need a bigger driveway.

I'm sure he would be even more pleasant when negotiating the second, third and fourth cars he'd eventually want to park in your driveway too. /s\n\nSeriously, though, very smart choice, NTA.", "Concrete pad is great. Our neighbor put a big garage door on the back of his garage, and a pad behind for more parking space.", "Or even just gravel where they park. It's cheaper, and it still works.", "Good point.

Lots of assholes and nosy people.", "Actually motorcycles and motorized bicycles are smaller \u2026 not a crazy idea.", "Someone's entitled. The real asshole is the household with 3 Generation under one roof and expecting others to put up and deal with their lack of planning. I have the same situation as OP, EXCEPT I purposely park in the street so they can't use the spot in front of my house, so they don't leave nasty oil stains in front of my house and to prevent them from scratching the sidewalk leaving permanent marks. \n\nBTW are you even a house owner? Do you not understand what op means when she says she doesnt want that type of liability?", "You expect him to pay to get a contract that's enforceable drawn up?", "These people have 5 cars and a home large enough for multiple cars. It's safe to assume that in a suburb like this, they also likely have a large garage that could fit multiple cars. These aren't people who recently immigrated to the country, *there are 3 generations already living in it.* I don't believe for a second that it was a \"massive trauma\" to the kids who have grown up there, it sounds more like they just don't want to pay money to expand their driveway.\n\nAs others have already pointed out, the other family parking their cars in OPs driveway leaves them open to liabilities for car damage if one of their kids hits a car with a bike or something. This is 100% NTA. They own 5 cars, either park it in the grass like before and tell the cops to stop the harassment or shell out the money for a bigger driveway. No way have 3 generations lived in that house in constant fear of the police and immigration stuff.", "Contracts don\u2019t always hold up in court when someone gets hurt and she would probably have to fight it in court to come to a decision in a case so she would still be put money no matter what. Also if her kids play on the drive way she would have to be trusting that the other family is always paying attention. Realistically the family should have to give up a car or perhaps move to a place that can accommodate them. This also sounds long term, op shouldn\u2019t be forced into a situation that has risks and could potentially end her up in a negative situation when the other family has other solutions that might inconvenience them but are still practical."]}
