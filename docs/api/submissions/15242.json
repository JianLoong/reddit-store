This was in Texas too The police isnt here to check immigration status, i call bs on the neighbor using that to make OP cave. Sure the police can ask if they want but who go to people\u2019s house and ask for their green cards? A lot of Americans dont even know what green card is", "he owns five cars ??", "Multiple generations with their own cars living in one home. I\u2019m sure they can afford to upgrade.", "That's simply not true. Go to literally any urban residential street. That's the excuse they teach you to keep you supporting policies that keep out the poors. Where I grew up houses were 3 feet apart. Tons of passing space on the street without ever blocking a driveway.", "Ok but that's Germany dude.", "Damn that sucks, not much anyone could do I guess, you're not the asshole btw, they could park in the back yard they would have to open up their fence, but that's an easy solution if they're unwilling to sell one of the vehicles", "Yeah I have a neighbor thats a classic car mechanic. He has adult children living there too. They paved thier front grass and use ever inch to park vehicles, and then at night, block thier own driveway. Nice thing is, nobody on our block seems to care? It's a nicer neighborhood too, but he's always out with his garage open, saying high to everybody and explaining his work so I guess ppl just let it go as they should.", "Ehh depending on where they're located (assuming the US, since they refer to it as a green card), it's not an unrealistic situation. I don't know if it was upheld in court, but iirc Arizona has/had a policy that police could ask for proof of citizenship/legal residency during a stop or call based on the officer's own suspicions. Depending on when this happened and/or how brown the neighbors are, it's entirely believable that the police may have done a green card check on an entire family.", "Yup, same for us. My light rail monthly ticket costs less than car maintenance and gas for a month.", "Just shows how you have to make rules and set limits because no one will treat anyone fairly unless they have to! People suck sometimes.", "What\u2019s the difference between a redneck and a hillbilly?  A redneck throws his empties out the window on his way home. A hillbilly waits until he parks on his front lawn.", "So speak to the person about it, don\u2019t just go straight to calling the cops.", "The eyesore thing is weird to me. Like it's not your house mind your own business.", ">Right\u2026I understand money might be an issue, but they could pave another spot into their lawn\n\n That could depends on country and city rules.  I was going to do this myself and found out I couldn't.", "Oh it's not on the sidewalk at all.   \n\n\nI'm trying to figure how to describe it - it's a normal arrangement here.  There's my driveway. Then there's the sidewalk with a dropped kerb. Then there's the parking bay: the sidewalk and parking bay cross along the bottom of the drive. (It's the same arrangement elsewhere in the street.)  \n\n\nMy vehicles are not parked on the sidewalk at any time.", "But you didn't say it would be *nice* if OP did. You said \"a nice person\" would help them, which seems to say that if they aren't helped you cannot be *nice*. You can be a nice, decent person and not allow unfettered use of your driveway to your neighbors that don't have the space for all the cars they own. They aren't mutually exclusive. \n\nIf - to be *nice* - you had to say yes to every request asked of you, no one would be considered *nice*. Or the only people considered *nice*  would those that allow others to take advantage of them at every single turn.", "Good question. I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of new people (my area has experienced a lot of growth over the last decade but particularly in the last couple of years during since the start of Covid) are not quick to change their tags. When I\u2019ve inquired about this in conversations with folks in local fb groups, I\u2019ve gotten some obnoxious replies about how it\u2019s expensive to register a new vehicle in my state ($40 registration/plate fee + $15 title fee + $250 infrastructure maintenance fee if a new resident, + personal property tax on the vehicle, which is an annual tax) and their old registration is still valid in that state so why change it before they have to? \n\nWhich is of course annoying because they are suppsed to register their vehicle within 45 days of moving and those fees/taxes pay for services, including schools and parks and stuff. Which are now crowded due to the influx of new residents and poor planning on the part of local and state government. \n\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t blame people for wanting to move to a place they think will be a better place to live or raise their kids. I wasn\u2019t born here either. But when you move to a new place thinking it\u2019s going to be so much cheaper than where you came from (despite it being a popular coastal area) while driving up the COL for the people currently there, and then you complain about the schools because you didn\u2019t do your research before moving, and then you brag about not changing your plates over and paying those fees in a timely fashion- don\u2019t be surprised if people think that\u2019s a dick move. \n\nNeedless to say I was kicked out of an FB group for telling people i though that was lousy. And warning people about the school overcrowding. I guess the real estate agents moderating the group didn\u2019t care for that \ud83d\ude02", "Good point! That's a concern, for sure. I think in my area, it's more about aesthetics. But either way, that might be why someone else reported it.", "How, by putting signs up?  No enforcement means no enforcement.  The Volunteer Fire Department was using all the street parking before our development went in.  While it was being built, they put up \u201cNo Parking except for Department personnel\u201d signs on this wood fence.  So I checked the work orders for the county and there weren\u2019t any for that road.  So I looked at the signs more carefully and they looked different from what the County uses.  Different font, colors off.  And each sign had a tacky area near the corner, like a sticker was there.  I put some dirt on it and sure enough there used to be a sticker.  A little googling for custom street signs and I found an Etsy that looked promising.  And behold, they showed their recent productions, including our VFD.  They seemed quite annoyed those signs disappeared, that they complained about it at a community meeting.  They weren\u2019t expecting the backlash response about them illegally installing signs, lol.", "Where I live you can get free mulch from the city, and a lot of people use it to create extra parking spaces", ">No, I would write up a contract for limited use of the driveway, for a price\n\nAnd deal with the problems turning your home into a commercial business can cause?\n\nWould you pay for the attorney needed to make sure the contract is legally valid and doesn't end up causing more problems for you than it solves?", "Not changing their plates to avoid fees and property taxes is tax evasion. Every county in my state has a snitching hotline and website to report them.  If they catch them, they owe back taxes and a huge penalty.", "I based my comments on experience with very bad neighbours in the past. With their numerous cars they took over the street. **This attitude was reflected in pretty much everything they did.** \n\nLikewise, OP's neighbour feels entitled to use his property. And once you start swearing at me you lose any sympathy I might have for you. \n\nFor the record, I generally have a lot of sympathy for immigrants, legal or otherwise, who have come to my country looking for a better life for their families. In particular, I have a special fondness for Hispanics. In my travels I found them to be some of the most hospitable people in the world. \n\nThere are good people and not so nice people in every corner of the world. \n\nBTW, if I wanted something from the neighbours, I would try to win them over by turning on the charm. I just don't get people who yell and swear at you, then expect you to give them what they want.", "Fair enough, it's only normal in allowed areas here.", "Having grown up around these exact situations, garunfuckintee they clear out when and if the landlord is planning to drop by because they have 4 people max on their lease."]}
