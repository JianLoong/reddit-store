So her wedding dress size reflects that. She passed away two years ago so she will can not attend our daughters wedding that will be in 2025.\n\nNow my daughter wants to wear the dress and I told her it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea since she won\u2019t be able to squeeze into it. She told me she can just up the size of it and I told her I would think about it. I looked into it and they basically cut the dress up to size it up.\n\nI informed her no she can\u2019t wear the dress since they would be cutting it up. This resulted in a huge argument about me gatekeeping my wife\u2019s things. I told her no again, and that she can wear some of her jewelry. She hung up.\n\nShe clearly thinks I am a jerk and my sons are now on me to give up the dress. \n\nAITA\n\nSince it was asked twice, my wife always wanted to go dress shopping with our daughters. She loved her wedding dress and I don\u2019t think she would be okay with it being cut up \n\nI also have a younger daughter since that was asked\n\nAlso I am confused why a lot of the comments mention my youngest is super skinny like my wife? I never said that, she won\u2019t fit into the dress either.

Is it a piece of your wife you\u2019re not ready to let go of yet? Does cutting it up feel like you\u2019re cutting up a memory or a keepsake?\n\nThis is obviously not about the dress itself or how your wife \u201cwould\u201d have felt about it, but about YOU feel about it. Which is OK, but don\u2019t forget, you have some time to process this. You may find yourself okay with it after more time has passed. Or not. It\u2019s okay to be honest about your reasons for declining but leave the door open to your stance changing later.\n\nINFO2: how much bigger would the dress need to be sized? Like will the dress still look more or less the same after, or will it be cut up into a whole new dress?\n\nEdit NAH", "A year ago I probably would have said you were an A H. Your wife doesn\u2019t need the dress and won\u2019t be able to go shopping so why not. But in the last year I lost my mom after taking care of her in my home for 9 years. (Yes I know it\u2019s different to lose a spouse; my daughter lost her husband.)\n\nMy point is that I now realize that people grieve differently and we cannot dictate to someone else what they should or should not do. \n\nYou are not ready to give up your late wife\u2019s dress to be cut up and remade. It\u2019s that simple\u2014**you\u2019re not ready**.  End of discussion. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt kinda depends on how much bigger your daughter is. If she\u2019s 125 lbs I say you\u2019re in the wrong. If she\u2019s 200lbs then she\u2019s in the wrong.  There\u2019s not much extra fabric in a formal dress!\n\nI\u2019m stuck at ____ without that info and your late wife\u2019s wishes.  \n\nI think the BORROWED jewelry is a great idea!\n\n\nEdited to change my vote!", "NTA. Not sure why people are not getting that this is a personal treasure of OP's, the dress his late wife married him in.", "NAH\n\nNeither of you are AH, but I would offer something to think about:\n\nThe best memory your wife had in that dress was marrying you. \n\nDo you really think she intended for it to hang in the closet for the next 70 years, after you both have passed, until it eventually fell a part and was eaten by moths? \n\nOr would she have wanted her daughter to wear it and create her own special memories?\n\nWhat is going to happen to it when you pass? You are going to give it to one of your daughters and they will, most likely hang it in a closet for forget about it.\n\nFor reference, I am currently sitting a room with a closet full of my father and father-in-laws clothes and jackets that could not be thrown away after they both passed. They are going to sit in that closet until we get tired of moving them, and then they are going to get donated. We do not take them out to look at them, we don't wear them, they literally just sit in the closet.\n\nYour wife's passing is still raw and something you will never get over. It is the same for her daughters. I am sure you have heard it a hundred times, \"you can get another wife, they cannot get another mother.\" We often glance over the pain of losing the spouse and focus on the children who lost their mother. \n\nIf it is your pain preventing you from letting it go, then be honest with your daughter and let her know that you cannot bear to part with it. \n\nBut please don't deny your daughter a gift that would bring her so much joy and happiness if the only reason is because you \"think\" your wife \"might\" not have wanted it to be altered.\n\nShe wants to feel close to her mother on her wedding day and the dress she wants is just sitting in a closet, never to be seen or used again. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss, and hers too. I hope you both can reach a solution that leaves you happy.", "NTA, she's not entitled to the dress, but ... do you have another daughter? If not, who is going to wear this dress in the future? It seems to me that the dress might be better used as part of your daughter's wedding dress to honor her mother rather than sitting in the closet. But it's your choice.", "NAH.\n\nIt\u2019s your wife\u2019s dress so of course it\u2019s yours to decide what to do with. I\u2019m sure it holds a lot of sentimentality for you.\n\nBut I can\u2019t fault your daughter. Her mom\u2019s death is still relatively fresh for her too and she\u2019s trying to plan a wedding without her, which is not something she ever would have wanted. So she\u2019s most likely trying to feel like her mom is still there.", "INFO: What were your wife's wishes regarding the dress?", "NTA, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be the minority unfortunately but most people are unable to fathom how devastating the loss of a spouse is. At the 2 year mark you are still in early grief. My husband died unexpectedly, I gave his daughters some things right off the bat, but others I\u2019m having a difficult time parting with and it activates the \u201cfight or flight\u201d centers of my traumatized brain. Make no mistake, our brains are traumatized, our decisions may not seem rational to others but they don\u2019t know what this kind of grief will do to you. \nBefore anyone says \u201cSHE LOST HER MOTHER!\u201d I get that, I honestly do, my son was 5 when my husband died and it kills me knowing he will grow up without his dad.\nAlso, while I vote NTA, I think you should let her wear the dress. \nI\u2019m not in your position but I can imagine that thinking about someone cutting the dress apart might feel like you are losing another part of her when you have already lost so much. You\u2019re not losing her again by letting your daughter wear the dress and feel like a part of her mom is with her on her special day. I also imagine it could be extra emotional for you to see her in the dress your wife wore on your happy day together. Perhaps that\u2019s driving some of your reluctance to let her wear the dress or maybe I\u2019m totally off the mark.\nIf you don\u2019t already work with a therapist/grief counselor I would encourage it, and encourage you to explore your feelings beyond \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t want it cut up\u201d. \nI always find there are deeper emotions under those hard decisions for me, maybe you\u2019re just not able to put your finger on it beyond thinking the dress will be ruined. The dress will be fine, but you\u2019re risking ruining your relationship instead.\nSalvage this relationship with your daughter, we are alone enough as it is, you need each other.", "Would you be okay having a seamstress carefully remove some lace or fabric from the dress? Maybe it could be a compromise for your daughter. My grandmother gave me a piece of lace from her wedding dress to use as a wrap around the stems in my bouquet. It was my 'something old'.\n\nOr, if your wife had a veil, perhaps your daughter could wear that? There are lots of ways to compromise without allowing the wedding dress to be significantly altered. I understand it holds sentimental value to you but it also hold sentimental value to your daughters. \n\nA cute idea would be gifting your daughter a piece of lace from the dress with a locket or charm with her mother's picture in it. They can be incorporated into the bouquet and your late wife can still walk down the aisle with your daughter and be present in a way for her wedding. I had a charm of my dad on my bouquet as he passed when I was a child. It was super emotional and sentimental knowing he was still there to walk with me down the aisle at my wedding.\n\nEdit: forgot to pass judgement - NAH. Your loss is recent and your hesitation to allow your daughter to use her mother's dress is understandable. YWBTA though if you don't find some way to compromise with her though as having a piece of her mother with her on her wedding day, especially when she lost her mother so recently, is clearly important to your daughter.", "NTA\n\nThe alterations sound significant and it also means she's unlikely to return the dress to storage to you; she'd  make it her own in a way she's overwriting the fact it was your wife's dress, both visually and in terms of its history and context. \n\nYou're perfectly within your rights to not be okay with that. It doesn't matter you won't wear the dress, you're the primary person for whom it has the most sentimental value and it's literally in your possession so.", "NTA\n\nNot every person who saves their wedding dress intends to pass it down or give it to a relative to wear later on. Your wife intended to go dress shopping with her daughters had she not passed. You\u2019re allowed to keep the dress the way your wife intended or let your daughter use it. It sounds like if it wouldn\u2019t be cut up, and returned to you after it was worn, you\u2019d be fine with her using it. But since it\u2019d be completely taken a part you aren\u2019t ok with it. Look into getting a replica made in your daughter\u2019s size if it\u2019s not possible to find another one online or at a vintage wedding shop. Also, you have two daughters. The dress shouldn\u2019t be cut up and then kept by one daughter in the event the other daughter also wants to use it. I think giving her the wedding jewelry is a great compromise.", "I can understand you both. You don't want to \"destroy\" your wifes dress that obviously means a lot to you. But the dress also means a lot to your daughter.\nA compromise might be to find a Taylor and copy the design. Your daughter could wear a copy and her mothers veil (if she had one) and her mother jewelery.", "NTA.\n\nSizing up never works anyway\u2026 and it will cost as much or more than a new one to alter this so significantly. And you have more than one daughter\u2026 why does one get to destroy the dress, what about the other/s?\n\nYour daughter can wear some of the jewellery. Maybe the veil? Anything from a hair piece survive? She can buy a dress that fits her beautifully.", "NTA- My mom is 5 ft and was 95 pounds when she married. There is no way I would ever fit her dress. Am I sad? Yes, but the genetic lottery said I would be 5\u20196 and 180. Did my sister who is 5\u20193 wear it? Yup she did. Am I salty? A little in the way of being salty that I can\u2019t go into a clothing store and expect they have my size. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to gift it knowing it would be significantly altered.", "INFO:  Did you actually use the phrase \"squeeze into it?\"", "I highly doubt either daughter would wear the dress as-is. Fashions change all the time, even in bridal, and what was in style at the time of your wedding is almost certain to be \u201cugly\u201d at the time your daughters get married. \n\nTheir mother died, and they want a piece of her on their wedding day. Why not have the dress deconstructed, and let each daughter have some fabric to use in their own wedding? It could be incorporated into their dresses, used as the sash tied around a bouquet, etc. \n\nThis way both daughters get access to the dress.", "This might be a weird question but would you be okay with it if she did fit? Like giving it away to her and her keeping it forever? Is it the giving away part that bothers you or the altering?\n\nNTA, but remember that it means a lot to you, but it also means a lot to your daughter. If you decide not to let her have it I would absolutely not let the younger daughter have it either.", "NTA. I was already leaning towards NTA but based on your edit, it solidifies it. \n\nMaybe I'm just a selfish person, but I completely see why you want to keep your wife's dress the way it is. \n\nYou're grieving and clearly not ready to let go. \n\nThat dress was worn by her on the one of the biggest days of both of your lives, your wedding day and is probably very sentimental to you and holds a lot of memories. Once it's cut up, no matter how similar, it will not be the same dress. It will also be your daughter's to do whatever she wants with from that point forward. \n\nIt's a beautiful gesture that your daughter wants to honour her mother by wearing it, but, it is not her automatic right. \n\nIf your wife had left the dress to her in her will, then there wouldn't be too much you could do, but technically, it is your dress. It also wouldn't be fair to your younger daughter.\n\n I think jewelry is a great compromise since it doesn't need to be altered, I hope she can come around.", "First of all, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to keep your late wife\u2019s wedding dress intact as a keepsake for you. Like you said, you only have pictures from your wedding day, but this is something a bit more tangible. I think if it brings you comfort or joy, you are allowed to keep the dress as is. \n\nHowever, if you say no to one daughter, you will have to say no to both. \n\nI think jewelry or using the veil if you have it would be a fantastic alternate. \n\nI hope in time the rest of your family understands.", "INFO: OP, have you discussed using the dress with both of your daughters? You lost your wife and they lost their mom. She won't be there to help plan either of their weddings, won't be there to go dress shopping, none of the things that they'd have looked forward to doing with her. So ask both girls what they think as it feels like your older daughter wants to honour her mother's memory.\n\nAlso-altering a dress is a bit different to 'cutting it up'. A good seamstress can let out seams and make unnoticeable alterations. And the re-alter it again if your younger daughter wants to wear it too. It feels like you're not emotionally ready to let go of your wife's things, but this is a topic where I think you'll regret it if you don't reconsider.", "NTA\nshe wants to cut or size up or wtv the dress the love of your life wore on arguably the most important day of your lives? and considering she passed away and they\u2019re forcing you to give it up is disrespectful. \n\nwhy is everyone saying this man is wrong? he even offered to let her wear the jewelry but she didn\u2019t want to hear it. it\u2019s not the end of the world if the daughter doesn\u2019t wear what her mother wore. this man is grieving his life partner so he\u2019s allowed to keep the dress.", "NAH\n\nBut as a woman, if I died, I would want my daughter to cut up my dress and incorporate it into hers however she liked. \n\nThe problem is you have a younger daughter who might also want it or part of it. \n\nIt's hard. Lots of feelings are involved here. Hope you work it out.\n\nEdit: vote change", "I understand you have more than one daughter. Here\u2019s the thing, if you let the other daughter use the dress (if she wants it) you\u2019re going to hurt the one wanting it now deeply. So if one doesn\u2019t get it, none should.  \n\nAlso, everyone is grieving including the kids. NTA and if there is a veil maybe that would be a good offer to your daughter. She just might not want to do the dress shopping because her mom won\u2019t be with her.", "You would only be the AH if, in the future, you allow your other daughter to wear the dress. This one has asked first and is getting married first, so she should have that option if wanted.  But you need to really reflect on why this has caused you to potentially destroy the relationship you have with your daughter. Ultimately, that's where this is leading. Especially if the second daughter is given the option later to wear the dress.", "So many people on here seem to overlook that OP was widowed only two years ago so naturally is still grieving. It's understandable that he doesn't want the dress either used or cut up so end of discussion. OP can keep it stored for decades if HE chooses.", "Info: If your youngest daughter can fit into the dress if/when she's getting married, would you allow her to wear it?", "NTA. I  understand that you are both still deep in grief as it only been 2 years. Next month is the 2nd anniversary of my  partner's passing so I  am  there with you in spirit . You and your daughters may want to consider sitting down together and talking about this. Is there a way that you could find someone to make a replica? Maybe with a small piece of the dress lining, or an embellishment? I hope you find a solution that brings joy to  you all.", "NTA. I sew. You can not \"size up \" a dress. It's not just the waist. It's not just adding 2 panels to the sides. It's shoulders and arms and the fall over the butt. The entire dress would be taken apart and resewn into a new dress. I would suggest having it made into christening gowns instead. One for each daughter. And they would become family heirlooms. My great grandmother's dress was made into a christening gown, and we embroider each child who wears it onto the slip. Over 30 so far... It's wonderful to go through all the names each time it's taken out...", "NTA. \n\nI understand your daughter\u2019s sentimentality, and wanting something of her mother\u2019s on her wedding day. But that dress also represents YOUR wedding with your wife. Since your wife is gone, it\u2019s reasonable to want to keep that representation in tact.", "NTA\n\nYou can't just \"size up\" an existing dress. That's just not how any of this works\n\nIF there is extra fabric at the seams you could in theory let it out a bit but not enough to change the sizing dramatically", "To all the commenters saying, \u201cYour wife isn\u2019t coming back\u201d or \u201cYour wife is dead so she won\u2019t be wearing it\u201d are all AH. That is so unnecessary and cruel. Clearly none of you have lost someone so incredibly close to you to not understand how hard it can be to give up sentimental items, even to your children whom also lost that person, and don\u2019t understand how sentimental a wedding dress can be. It doesn\u2019t make him and AH for being concerned about a dress he watched the love of his life marry him in be ruined. I do however agree he should have been more tactful in his response and hopefully a compromise can be made. But seriously, those saying all those mean things about his wife are awful and I hope you all have the day you deserve.", "NAH.  I\u2019m a seamstress.  Unless your daughter is just a few inches bigger than your wife, you can\u2019t \u201cup the size\u201d on the dress.  It would have to be taken apart and essentially rebuilt, which wouldn\u2019t really be the same dress (and depending on if the same fabric was available/beading on it/length might not even be possible).  However, perhaps you could suggest that she has a replica of the dress made in her size?", "NAH, but if you let your second -  I'm guessing smaller - daughter wear it, you would be the asshole", "I will say that it is the norm to save your wedding dress in case on if your daughters wants to wear it one day. And maybe that\u2019s why the wife was holding onto hers. I could be wrong in this instance as everyone has their reasons, but generally, that\u2019s why you keep the dress.", "NAH.  As a daughter that lost her father and who still grieves, I can understand you both.  I remember when my mom donated all my dad\u2019s shirts and jackets and shorts, etc\u2026 and how much I hated that act.  But the truth is that I hate that my dad is gone and not coming back.  He isn\u2019t here to wear or appreciate that clothing, and someone else can benefit from the donation.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s OK that you aren\u2019t ready to let go, and it\u2019s OK that your daughter wants a piece of significance that makes her feel that mom is with her on her wedding day.\n\n\nBut please don\u2019t rely on \u201cthe dress would have to be altered\u201d as an excuse, because that\u2019s not the reason.  The dress hold tremendous emotional value to you, and it\u2019s something you\u2019re not willing to part with, at least not yet.\n\n\nYou\u2019re both experiencing grief, and it\u2019s okay to own that.", "Not providing a veredict but things to keep in mind:\n\n\\- If you dont allow this daughter to wear the dress, do not allow it to the other one either, despite the size. It will make your daughter miserable. You might be right, but she will suffer, a lot, thinking you have a favorite.\n\n\\- Did your wife wear a veil or accessories other than jewelry? those dont change for size, they could use that.\n\n\\- Do not hold too hard onto material things. Your wife can't care about the dress, sadly. In 150years that dress will be.... who knows where/what.\n\nMy mom made my bedroom curtains with her veil. I keep them to this day. Sure, it's no longer a veil, but I get to enjoy them every day and a bit of her stays with me in my daily life. Things shouldnt stay locked away gathering dust.", "NTA. It's a sentimental item and you clearly don't want it damaged or altered. The offer of jewellery was a good one.", "Well, how much bigger is your daughter than the dress? I do alterations, and my specialty is wedding dresses. It's not ideal to make a small dress bigger, but adding a corset is always an option, provided your daughter isn't 3+ sizes bigger, and it's something that could be done that could be reversed too if your younger daughter ever wants to wear the dress. Some wedding dresses have ample seam allowance to let out. If you go to a reputable tailor, and the dress isn't awful, it will be better than \"cutting it up\". Cut us some slack lmao.\n\nAre there any components of the dress that could be removed and added to your daughter's dress if she buys one? Like applique? I've had brides who cut out fabric from their late dad's shirt or mom's wedding dress and sew it into their dress, usually against their heart.\n\nI'm going to say NAH because I see both sides, and everybody is emotionally charged. However, I feel like if you say no to one daughter, you say no to both. It would be so heartbreaking to your older daughter if her younger sister was allowed to wear the dress she was rejected to wear.", "NTA but you will be if you let one daughter use it and not another because I can guarantee the anger and pain it would cause absolutely wouldn\u2019t be what your late wife wanted. This is either something they can agree on a way to be able both use it or no family members uses it under any circumstances at all, no if buts or maybes.", "NTA. You say your wife wanted to go dress shopping with her daughters. Why don\u2019t you do that? You can advise on what your wife wore at your wedding, her veil, shoes, what the decorations were like, etc.", "NTA, it's a very sentimental item, that once cut up, can't be restored. It's okay for you to say that you don't want that. You also offered a compromise. It's not okay for you to voice your feelings and then deal with guilt-tripping, tantrums and attempts at manipulation and pressure.", "NAH\n\nYou both want to hold onto your wife\u2019s memory, you are just approaching it in different way.\n\nUltimately, it is up to you. But I would encourage you to think about why keeping a dress preserved in a box in a closet feels more like honoring your wife then repurposing it so she can be there in spirit on your daughters day. You\u2019re definitely not an asshole. You are trying to do right by your wife and keep a memory yourself. This is a hard choice.\n\nI will just say whatever rule you make for one daughter must apply to the other, even if your younger daughter can fit in the dress", "NTA, but perhaps there is a section of the dress that can be reasonably cut off near a hem or if there is a train to incorporate into her own wedding dress?", "NTA it was your wife\u2019s dress and you can keep it that way if it is of sentimental value to you.", "This is such an emotionally charged situation. You are all grieving immensely. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nNAH, just two people grieving differently.\n\nI would drop the conversation for now and check in on how everyone is feeling closer to when she needs to buy a dress and everyone has had more time to process how they feel and why they feel that way.", "Your daughter can't fit into the dress and making it fit would essentially destroy the memento. NTA.", "I can understand both sides of it. You lost a wife, but she lost a mother too. I guess I\u2019m genuinely curious what you plan to do with it. Are you planning to leave it to one of your kids when you pass on? And what do you expect them to do with it then?", "This is not about what your wife would have wanted or what your daughter wants; it's not about the dress per se; it's about you and your grief and your memories of the woman you loved. I can't say that I completely understand your situation. I am a woman with no kids. But I am a widow, and I know that grief has its own timetable. I was able to give away some of my husband's belongings right away, some later, and some I still hold on to.\n\nYou have offered your wife's jewelry to your daughter. She should be content with that. It's understandable that she would like to have the dress, but she should respect what it means to you. NAH", "I think you have both a little bit of NAH and also ESH going on.\n\nYou have to remember that both of you are clearly still grieving. You lost your spouse. Your daughter lost her mother. That's traumatic to both of you, and everyone grieves differently and at different speeds. That means both of you are probably approaching this from an emotional angle.\n\nThere's no right answer for what to do with the dress. It sounds like no one can really know what your wife would have wanted here. So my advice is to think deep and about what's really most important to you now. Is it preserving this artifact of your wife's as is? Or about having a good shared relationship with your daughters moving forward? It can hurt to let things go, but it will also hurt later if this leads to resentment from your children.", "NTA. Did your wife have a veil or headpiece your daughter can incorporate instead?", "Adding panels to a dress to increase the size won't take any fabric away from the dress.  It won't prevent the dress from being restored to the original configuration after the wedding either.  It can be very stressful to imagine emotionally loaded items being altered, but this shouldn't destroy anything.\n\nI was a little smaller than your wife when I married.  113 lbs and 5'6\".  My wedding dress had to be cut down from a size zero to fit me.  If my kid wanted to wear it? She could cut it to ribbons.  But... The dress means something to you as well.  She was BOTH your wife and your child's mom.  You both have valid claims to her memory even if the daughters of a woman usually claim her wedding dress.\n\nNAH", "To be honest, I\u2019m with you on this one. You\u2019re still grieving and I believe that dress is precious to you in a way your daughters don\u2019t fully understand.

Maybe your daughter can buy a new dress and sew a piece of her mom's dress onto her new one.\n\nEdit: changed vote after reading your comment.

How dare you take something so special from a young lady on her wedding day. She may have been your wife but she\u2019s your daughters ONLY mother ever and the fact that her mom won\u2019t see her get married is sad enough. A dress is made of material, and is not a human. Your wife is not alive and does not have an opinion anymore BUT I suspect she would NOT agree with you. If I was dead, and my babies were getting married without me (and now I\u2019m crying) I\u2019d want them to do ANYTHING they could to help them feel braver, more beautiful, and CLOSER to me than ever. You took that from her to preserve YOUR memory, rather than let her build new ones. That is very selfish and appeases no one but yourself.

Maybe it\u2019s selecting pieces of the dress and veil to be incorporated into their own dresses, and using the rest to make a shadow box for you.  Maybe you come up with something else, but it\u2019s very important to consider that while you lost your life partner and love, the loss of their mother will be particularly keen on their wedding days.\n\nI\u2019m going to go with ESH, you should be sensitive to how this artifact is special to the daughter currently getting married, and she needs to be sensitive that she has a sister who also deserves a say.", "NTA it\u2019s only been two years and the dress will have to be altered.

I\u2019m a fashion designer and a wedding dress for a very petite person isn\u2019t able to be easily sized up after it\u2019s already been altered. A well-made wedding dress will have large seam allowances inside to allow for alterations at the time of sale. But your wife already wore the dress so it was likely altered to fit her. Whether you want to do this is relevant but it is likely an impossible request. My wedding dress had to be upped by one size after purchase and seamstresses didn\u2019t want to attempt it - thankfully my mother is a seamstress and was able to do it. I would hate if you and your daughter had a painful fight about something that is not even possible to do.", "Realistically, it\u2019s very hard to size a wedding dress up many sizes unless it\u2019s very very simple.

It\u2019s okay to not be ready to let it go yet, but I think you and your daughter need to be really honest with each other about how you each feel, and believe each other, regardless of the outcomes. It\u2019s not a tug-of-war over a dress, it\u2019s really about how your wife\u2019s memory lives on for each of you. \n\nMy suggestion, take or leave, would be to first talk about it, say you\u2019re not ready yet, but that you\u2019ll mull it over. You have over a year. Things change. I\u2019ve never lost a spouse which I know is harder to deal with, but when my dad died young and suddenly, I had a treasured keepsake of his. It was stolen and I was devastated. It was returned and I was elated. A few years on, it\u2019s sitting in my drawer and I don\u2019t really care about it anymore. The emotional attachment I felt between it and my dad dissipated. \n\nReflect on ways you might be okay with it - like just giving up the veil, or allowing alteration if the end style is the same. If you can have it back after. Or find some way to preserve the memory without keeping the item, like encasing a scrap of the fabric in framed resin. \n\nYour daughter should do the same. What if she had a dress custom made to match the style? What if she reached out to tailors and got some feedback on how much it would need to be altered to fit her size (if she\u2019s OW she\u2019s certainly many sizes bigger than your wife was at the time.)\n\nNo wrong answers here - just approach it with an open mind and open heart.", "My mum died too, to be honest I haven't taken or done anything with any of her things. Because my dad should have a say first. The only things I touch, are the things I'd steal from her anyway so cardigans and jumpers.\n\nI understand why you want the dress, and why cutting it seems like such a big issue. Because it was the dress your **wife** wore when she **married** you. For you, it's a reminder of one of the happiest days of your life. The day you got to make your commitment to eachother.\n\nIf she was alive, you'd probably still feel connected to it. But it would be different because she's alive. It's ok to feel like this, you're the only one who knows how much this is going to impact you if it is changed and modified. \n\nI think you need to sit down, and figure out why it's so difficult and what the loss of your wife and the significance of this dress means. And write it down, over the course of the week keep adding things to it. \n\nThen collect your thoughts and write it up as a letter, let your kids see it if you still feel the same as it's a way of describing your connection to this.\n\nPeople forget that a part of you does remain frozen after a huge loss like this, whilst you can and will move on and keep living. There are parts of you that cling to the pieces of your loved one you have.\n\nYour daughter and sons know the loss of a mother, but they don't know the loss of a partner. Maybe they won't understand it, but it's good for you to attempt to explain it. If they still don't understand or care, then it's your decision but it probably will impact your family moving forward. \n\nPersonally, I think your rights to the dress supercede your daughters. Because it is your wife. You even mention she wanted to go dress shopping with her daughters. So this will have added your attachment and reluctance to part with the dress and I understand it.\n\nWhat happens to the dress after you die doesn't matter, but right now it's something that connects you to your late wife.", "If it\u2019s more than two sizes difference (possibly three depending on the style of dress), it probably can\u2019t even be done. Wedding dresses usually have a fair amount of flexibility in terms of allowing for alterations, but you cannot make extra fabric appear out of nowhere and adding extra paneling will usually look terrible. You can\u2019t just \u201csize up\u201d an existing, highly structured garment which has already been tailored to fit an individual\u2019s body. \n\nHonestly, I suspect this is \u201cgirl fat\u201d ragebait. On the chance it isn\u2019t, take your daughter and the dress together to a competent seamstress who works on wedding alterations and can discuss what would have to be done to make it fit, how it would look after, and whether it\u2019s possible to preserve the structure of the dress (or put it back to how it was after). Get the expert opinion.", "NAH\n\nYou're both grieving and want to hold onto a piece of your wife/her mother. \n\nI think the biggest issue from your daughter's perspective is likely your approach.\n\nIt's completely ok and valid not to want your late wife's dress to be cut up and reconfigured into something different to fit your daughter on her wedding day.\n\nHowever, telling her she can't do it because it would require too many alterations doesn't convey what you really mean. Also, someone questioning the size of an article of clothing can be triggering for women.\n\nI think if you explained the sentimental value and memories, she would be less upset. I would tell her:\n\n>I love you and I'm sure you'd look beautiful in your mom's dress. The dress is one of my fondest memories of your mother and I'm not ready to part with it. I hope you understand. I would be happy to let you pick anything else of your mother's to wear at your wedding.\n\nNot sure if you have another wedding accessory to offer (e.g. wedding jewelry, a headpiece, wedding veils, wedding clutch purses, hand gloves) but I think that would be a great gesture.", "Op, you don't have to cut it up or give away, if you don't want to. It's YOUR WIFE'S dress. You can do what you please with it, you can keep it for memories. Many women actually do that with their own dresses. There is nothing wrong with wanting to keep this piece from your wife with you unaltered. Take care. Just explain it to your daughter so there are no bad feelings. Also, please mind HOW you say it, as for now it sounds like you're calling your daughter fat. She wouldn't like it, neither would your wife.", "What about getting a dress in the same style as it is the correct size? Would that be an acceptable compromise to your daughter?", "I was on the fence till it would have to go up several sizes. A couple is doable - bridal dresses should contain a large seam allowance because they're often altered. I had a vintage suit I got sized up and two sizes up was the absolute max. The fabric wasn't as worn and you can absolutely see that it's been altered.\n\n\nCan your daughter wear the veil, her mother's jewellery to go with a new dress? Something borrowed, and something to remember her mother and the example you set as a couple. She wants her mother with her on her special day, that makes sense. But if the dress can't be made into a larger size, hopefully the accessories were kept with it?", "I know that you\u2019re still grieving, and losing your life partner is *painful,* but so is losing your mother. You\u2019re not cutting up her memory because nobody can take that, your wife is still with you and your daughters. She\u2019s in the girls, she\u2019s everywhere in the house, she\u2019s ingrained in your mind and heart. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to give the daughters the dress then that\u2019s fine but, I think you also need to take a step back and think about your daughters for a minute. Girls dream of their weddings, they dream of their dads walking them down the isle\u2026 But they also dream about dress shopping and having their mom help them plan their perfect day. And your daughter doesn\u2019t have her mom to help her, and it seems like she wants that more than anything and\u2026 There\u2019s no fixing that feeling. \n\nIs there a way to compromise and have a small piece of the fabric taken from the original dress to be sewn into a new one? That way your other daughter can also have a piece whenever she gets married (if she isn\u2019t already). But if you\u2019re still not comfortable that\u2019s okay too, because everyone here is hurting and there\u2019s no real way to navigate through this. NAH.", "I think this is fair and you need to explain this to your daughter in that way. You are not ready to let go of it. Quit talking about the size difference. \n\nWith that said, be prepared to tell your younger daughter no if she ever asks to wear it. You may be further down the road in grieving and ready to let it go by then, but the pain you would cause your older daughter would be immense", "As a mother, as a woman, as a daughter, as an overweight person; for the love of God, please be gentle in how you address the size difference. This is a tricky minefield you have to cross, please remember she's not only a person, but your child.", "Compromise\u2026 have a new one made based on the old one but sized up?", "The general rule of thumb for tailoring most (not all, but *most*) wedding dresses is you can go 1 size up, 2 sizes down without too much impact on the style/structure of the dress itself. It varies quite a bit- my own dress was ordered in a size too large to begin with so it had to be taken in significantly, and then I lost some more weight and muscle mass after a sports injury and had to get it taken in even further. I was very lucky, but it cost almost as much as the starting price of the dress. And it was still a little roomy (but thankfully, not enough to be noticeable or matter much). Even simple wedding gowns are tricky and expensive to work with. \n\nI understand your daughter's wish and think it comes from a very heartfelt and genuine place, but if she's more than a couple sizes larger than her mother at the time she wore the dress, then it's simply unrealistic (most likely, anyway), if not entirely impossible, to alter it without ruining the integrity of the dress. The most she could hope for is to custom-create an entirely new dress from the material, but that's not entirely fair to either you or her sister, or even the mom, really. You knew her better than us internet strangers- if you feel she would not want that done to her dress, you probably are right about that (hell, I don't want that for *my* dress either. Lots of people may feel otherwise, but I don't want to pass it down, frankly, so I can understand why others might feel similarly). And the risk of error is very high. There is a reason wedding dress alterations are so expensive, and it has less to do with sentimentality. The level of skill, attention to detail, and care for dealing with such intricate and expensive garments, even vintage ones, is nothing to scoff at. I don't think you daughter has a realistic understanding of what's possible for a dress that's several sizes too small and it's going to end in disappointment and hurt feelings for everyone. \n\nIt's definitely a NAH kind of situation, though. You're both grieving and both of your feelings are valid, even if her expectations are unrealistic and in your case, I think your grief is clouding your own view somewhat. The jewelry or other accessories are a great compromise, and I've seen tons of creative bouquets and other accompaniments that work in charms, photographs, jewelry, or other accessories. Not to mention reserved seats and candle arrangements for deceased relatives.", "I think I'm going to agree with the original comment, NAH", "In that case NAH, I was your wife\u2019s weight and then gained less than 10 pounds. Yet my form-fitted clothes needed alterations. With an even bigger weight difference, the wedding gown needs a lot of work. Your daughter isn\u2019t TA either. Would you be ok going to a seamstress together and see what the options are?", "Take lots of pictures of the dress and get a seamstress to recreate it. \nThe original dress can be saved. \nHonestly it\u2019s probably not even possible to size up the dress it\u2019s probably I\u2019m guessing a size 4-6? Depending on what size your daughter is it\u2019s nearly impossible to size up a dress and have it look good if it needs to be bigger than a size or two.", "Could you take a piece of the wedding dress and have it sewn onto your daughters wedding dress. So it would be the \"something old and new\" and she would have a piece of her mom with her and the wedding dress isn't ruined by cutting it all up?", "Op you should definitely go with your daughter to a good tailor to talk about the dress. Most will refuse to do a dress if it has to go more than a couple of sizes as it destroys the dress and the end result looks bad. There is simply no more fabric to let out and adding new fabric is obvious, plus the dress\u2019 cut will not sit right as it won\u2019t lay were it should. Having a professional speak on this will help, but then you can also talk with them on what can be done. As others have said, they can help design a dress to look the same but for your daughter\u2019s size or ways to incorporate a small piece of the dress into your daughter\u2019s look. \n\nDo also talk with her about the emotional impact that the dress has with you. You both are hurting and need each other.", "YNTA. You knew your wife on the day the dress was worn, your daughter didn't, and it has more meaning for you. I think you can say that you don't want to let go of the dress because it has meaning to you left in its current state. I hope you would feel the same if your wife had been bigger and you didn't want it sized down for your daughter. \n\nWhen you talk to your daughter about the dress, don't talk about how the dress needs to be made bigger, just that it will be changed. It also needs to be off limits for your other kids, even if a bride can fit into it unaltered. \n\nKeep in mind that we can hold prejudices about beauty standards without even admitting it to ourselves, both you and your daughter. Keep it about saving the memory of your special day and not about weight.", "If it is that important to you in it\u2019s preserved state so be it. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. But as a mother, I would want nothing more than for my daughter to *want* to share her wedding day with me in this way. I\u2019d want her to shred my damn dress if it pulled me into this special day for her in a meaningful way. So base your decision on what YOU want. Not what you think your wife would want. Because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re accurately guessing what your wife would want.

You really can\u2019t say what she would want and this is likely to sound very insulting to your daughter. Even if it\u2019s what you believe, it\u2019s not what your daughter needs to hear. \n\nJust focus on what *you* want/need and don\u2019t put it off on what your wife might have wanted.", "Have you told your daughter this, that other than the photo, it\u2019s the only thing you have left of her and that day and that you are just not ready to let go of it?  Leave out what you think your wife would and wouldn\u2019t want. The reality is that she\u2019s \u2014 and I am so sorry for you and your daughter, so very sorry \u2014 not with you any more and cannot speak for herself. Even if you\u2019re correct, you\u2019re still guessing and it creates a different argument that distracts from the valid truth that you are not ready to let go of the dress, which resizing it would entail.

I still have many of his things in storage because I didn't know what to do with them.  I wish I would have gone through things earlier on, because the longer you wait, the harder it is to have conversations with people about who would appreciate items.  \n\nA wedding is obviously a time when you will be thinking about your late wife, and your daughters will be thinking about their mom.  Most women love their wedding dress and hold on to them, but usually with the intention of sharing some day.  \n\nI don't have judgement, really think there are no AH here, but I do think about what would be good for you to think about how you can honor your late wife at your daughter's upcoming wedding (and your other daughter, if/ when she weds).   \n\nYour daughter is coming across a bit entitled and we don't know why.  Can you have a conversation with both your girls about the dress/ veil/ jewelry?  Maybe get things out of storage to look at and share memories with them of your wedding day?  \n\nThe thing to remember about wedding dresses is if they aren't properly stored, they won't last forever.  They yellow, the lace can break down, sequins fall off, etc.  Is there a way to use the dress for both girls and yourself that will honor your wife and create a new keepsake for each of you?", "> Yes to all the first questions. It really feels like I am cutting up her memory and keepsake. Especially when I don\u2019t think she would want this to her dress. I am not ready to let go of this piece of my wife and only have picture of our wedding day\n\nHonestly I feel like this should form the core of your argument to your daughter.  Don't approach this as a weight issue, don't approach it as a cutting up the dress issue.\n\nSimply approach it as you not being ready to let go of that dress.  If you allow your daughter to alter the dress, it won't be the dress anymore and you're not ready to face that.\n\nIt would not matter if it needed to be upsized 1 size or 100 sizes.  Any alterations to the dress will make it not the dress and you're not ready to give that up, period.\n\nIt's not about her being bigger and the dress being too small.  That just allows them to attack you as ashamed of your daughter's weight when that's not the core of the issue.\n\nYou're not ready to let it go, period. You can be apologetic, you can be regretful, but you're just not ready and there's nothing that can change that. \n\nAlso, make sure you also don't allow your second daughter to have the dress.

You are taller and shaped more like the women in my family (if true.)

I understand you view this as losing the dress and the memories of your own wedding, but perhaps it would be more helpful to look at it as making new memories of the dress and allowing some part of your wife and her memory to be honored and participate in something she will not be able to be physically present for.

She\u2019s 5\u201d3/4 ish roughly, as of last week she\u2019s like idk 120(?)130 maybe? She isn\u2019t big or tall lol but WAY bigger then myself.\n\nIf ur just sizing is way bigger or smaller? It\u2019ll be ruined", "This dress is also likely delicate as it\u2019s old and may have things like yellow discoloration from storage, etc. Recreating it might be expensive depending on how elaborate it is, but cutting it up and resizing it might cost just as much if not more because the integrity of the fabric might make it difficult. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t want to wear a dress I had to be so careful with on my wedding day.", "Someone on this thread suggested seeing if a seamstress can design a very similar dress based on seeing the gown and photos of it \n\nI thought that was a terrific idea", "Yeah i saw a few folks suggest using the dress as a pattern for a new one, which could be a great idea. \n\nWhen it comes to resizing, though, my point is it can be done to some extent but not indefinitely. If a seam has two inches of fabric to let out, you\u2019re not going to be able to get it to expand to three inches without adding a panel of fabric, which generally looks terrible. If you need to lengthen a dress originally made for a 5\u20192 person to fit a 5\u20196 person, you can\u2019t just make that extra four inches of fabric appear from nowhere. You just can\u2019t squeeze blood (or fabric) from a stone.", "There's also another younger daughter to consider, if older sister cuts up the dress she won't be able to use it", "So you\u2019re looking at what you\u2019d want for your daughter as her mother. What you leave out of the equation is the emotional weight of your absence. She\u2019s not  just daughter anymore, she\u2019s daughter without a mother. He\u2019s not  a husband and dad, he\u2019s a widower and dad. They\u2019re all so desperate to make sure you\u2019re included in the day so they feel close to you, because you should be there. At the same time, dad especially does not want to lose any part of you and cutting up y your dress is distressing for him and exacerbates that fear that every time he loses something, you feel further away. \n\n\nThis major life event, probably the first since her passing, will be an important milestone in the grieving process for all three, and they should sit and hash out all their feelings about that together. And because everyone grieves differently, everyone will have different ways they want to memorialize mom, as well as to help feel them connected to mom. O would suggest no one do anything drastic like changing or cutting the dress or anything else that *may* later be a regret. Lots of great suggestions in these comments about ways to use the dress while keeping it in tact, etc. that they can talk about together.", "The dad offered to let her use the mom\u2019s jewelry, this daughter only wants the dress.", "Yeah honestly considering that there are two daughters it might be best to not let either of them wear it, since that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other one.", "I\u2019ve seen some people \u201cimprove\u201d beautiful but dated wedding dresses they got at a thrift store by completely chopping the dress into a million pieces and mutilating it into a mini dress or removing all the details to \u201cmodernize\u201d it. I have a feeling if OP\u2019s daughter did that, OP would be really heartbroken and upset. Daughter doesn\u2019t get to stomp on Dad\u2019s feelings just because she doesn\u2019t want to buy a dress.\n\n If she is too overweight to wear the dress, what they would do is probably completely chop it up and use the fabric to make a completely different dress. And that dress would likely not be useable for the younger daughter. \n\nThere are a lot of unskilled seamstresses advertising that this is a service they do, the dresses look amateurish and badly designed. It really takes a tremendous amount of skill to do this well, to have it done well would be extremely expensive and you are basically at the mercy of some idiosyncratic stranger that just wants to hack up a wedding dress. They put this stuff on YouTube or Tiktok as advertising for their business. Too many of these people aren\u2019t really skilled designers or seamstresses, it\u2019s a wedding dress and not a casual dress. Redoing a wedding dress or evening gown is completely different from being able to sew a day dress. There are a lot of design choices that have to be made, their design skills aren\u2019t up to it.  There\u2019s a lot of handwork and it\u2019s a lot of labor, so these people cut costs by just cutting the detail work off because they can\u2019t get matching materials and they really don\u2019t want to do the elaborate handwork or don\u2019t know how. Just because someone has an Etsy account doesn\u2019t make them a fashion designer. \n\nSome of these \u201cdesigners\u201d have horrible taste, they downgrade the detail work on the dresses because they want to turn them over quickly, but this is a trend now and daughter probably saw that. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know about sewing, you don\u2019t understand that completely remaking a dress is very difficult and realistically, all you would get is maybe some of the fabric from the skirt. Maybe the cuffs if they\u2019re fancy. And that\u2019s about it. But more likely, the designer would be somebody she heard of online who wants to completely change the dress and not try to preserve the original look at all. The lace and trims are vintage and not available any more, so the designer would remove all that because they can\u2019t get more. So you would get a dress that looks nothing like the original with many of the details gone. I\u2019ve seen some of these dresses and what they do doesn\u2019t respect the original design and it\u2019s heartbreaking, honestly. If you don\u2019t like the original, buy something else. \n\nShe would be more likely to get a pretty dress that suited her by buying a new one, and the younger sister might be able to wear the dress someday.", "Ooh I forgot about jewelry/call part by the time I got down here.

Even if younger daughter fits into it, she would likely need or want to make some pretty tangible changes or updates. Wedding dresses are usually extensively tailored to your body and are not particularly resilient to either the party itself or the years of storage. It's not guaranteed that the younger daughter (who as far as we know is not planning a wedding, so probably hasn't thought about it) would need to change the dress, but it's also not some promise that she could wear it out of the box just because she's smaller than her sister.\n\nIf he is not comfortable with either daughter wearing the dress, that makes sense.

Gowns are sized up and down all the time without compromising the integrity of the garment. Only a tailor can tell them if the dress can be sized up without damage. Yes they have to be taken apart at the seems either way. But it seems like that\u2019s an excuse, and instead of just telling his daughter he doesn\u2019t want anyone to use the dress he\u2019s saying it\u2019s about her weight. Even if she were the same dress size it\u2019s likely the dress would need alterations to fit a different person.", "I don't think op is an asshole. I said nah because the daughter lost her mom too. She's grieving as well. The dad seems to only be recognizing his grief. It would honor his wife's memory better if they could find some way to compromise. I think using some fabric for the veil could be an option.", "Excellent excellent comment", "Why should anyone else at all need to wear that dress?\n\nI didn't want to wear my mother's dress, I wanted one in my own style. My brother's wife didn't want to wear her mother's dress, or my mom's, because she also wanted something in her own style.\n\nI don't think any bride whose wedding I've been to has worn their mother's dress. And come to think of it, what happens to all those old dresses no one wants? What if a mother has only sons, or no kids at all? What am I supposed to do with *my* wedding dress? I think I still have it somewhere.", "it's not about the dress being worn again. just thinking about losing my wife makes me start crying. a wedding dress reminds him of their wedding. this isn't hard math to me.", "Yes, I'm seven inches taller than my mom.  I couldn't fit into her wedding dress when I was 12 (she thought it would be fun to try).  I couldn't have come close the year I had a stomach infection and was 15 pounds underweight.", "Yeah.  There's a really practical element here that hasn't really been discussed.\n\nRegardless of the daughter's wishes, there's a very real chance this won't work.   It really depends on the dress's construction, but a great many dresses can not be made to go up several sizes in a way that anyone would be happy with.  It's not a matter of going to the tailor and turning the size dial.\n\nThe dress could be effectively remade for the daughter, but at that point you're basically using the original dress as raw materials in the construction of a new dress.  It might not look or \"feel\" like the same dress with alterations.  I'm not saying that's the definite outcome - it could be possible to make this work.  \n\nThere's an outcome here that's not really been discussed - the daughter takes the dress to a tailor, who does their best to make it work but ends up with something nobody is happy with and the daughter ends up going with a different dress rather than look terrible at her own wedding.  \n\nI'm speaking from experience here - a family member did something similar and it did not work.  That was fine in my case because nobody had a strong attachment to the original wedding dress and the possibility of failure was understood, but in this case I think it would be a messy disaster.", "I was thinking the same! Sizing down more than 2 sizes is difficult even. Sizing up is a whole different beast!", "Likely neither of them are going to have the dress. More likely op would let them borrow the dress during their wedding if they can fit into it.", "My sister just got married, and my mom offered to loan my sister her dress. I asked her about this thread and she said it was ridiculous, lol. The dress is just sitting in the closet. Does OP still have his suit? Are his sons welcome to borrow it when they get married? OP's grief is clouding his judgment here. If his younger daughter gets married someday when he can see things more clearly and he lets her wear the dress, that's going to create a HUGE rift in the family.", "A good seamstress can't do magic.

One of the happiest and most fulfilling days of your life. The day you promised to love and cherish her forever. I do not blame you for saying no. I probably would too. \n\nAs someone else pointed out. A dress maker could replicate it in her size.

I know you said you don\u2019t think she\u2019d want the dress cut up, but that was while she was here and could have attended the event herself.

Is there a bit of lace or something that could be removed inconspicuously? Or if there\u2019s a veil, she could wear that? \n\nI grew up knowing if I ever got married I would never wear my mom\u2019s dress because she was tiny at the time and I never have been, but I think that\u2019s what I would do. \n\nBut you need to be kind and honest at the same time. Growing up larger than your mother can be a fraught feeling, since unfortunately we live in a world that assigns value to people based on their size. So having that be the reason \u2014 on top of the fact that she is grieving the fact that her mother won\u2019t be at her wedding \u2014 likely feels like an extra slap in the face.", "Some people just aren't sentimental like that. I've lost people important to me and I remember them through memories and photos. I just don't associate people with things like that. \n\n\nBut I'm not everyone and everyone has the right to deal with things like this on their own. I personally would have no problem giving up a wedding dress for someone else important to me to use and I honestly don't understand why you wouldn't want something someone loved to go to someone they loved that can use it, but I do understand that some people feel that way and that's ok as well.", "Is there an option for you to take your daughter to a dress maker and have them recreate the wedding dress in your daughter's size?\n\nI can also understand your daughter wanting to wear the original.

Most wedding dresses are very tailored items, most people who wear old dresses make alterations even if the goal is to keep the original look intact. Maybe it wouldn't appear as dramatic, but I'm guessing just knowing it's not the same dress would have the emotional impact. \n\nSo, if that's true, you can assure her it's not about her size, there's no amount of weight she could or should lose, it's simply that to make the dress her own takes a keepsake that you want to stay frozen in time away from you. \n\n(It's almost better this issue flagged early so you didn't give her the dress with an unspoken assumption it wouldn't be changed only to come to find out too late she was assuming she could modify it since that is pretty typical of dress fitting.)", "Also, alternating the wedding dress would ruin the sentimentality of wearing the mom's wedding dress, because it won't be \"the dress\" if I'm making any sense here.\n\nKinda a weird example but my mom lost both her parents young, she's had five of her father's old suit jackets since. The only things she has left of him, she brought it up once and now never again, altering one of them for my wedding one day. \n\nThere was a lot of sadness in her eyes when she said it, I never asked, but I can only guess it's hard to see something that was so clearly someone else's worn/altered to fit another person.

I have two daughters and was recently diagnosed with breast cancer; my prognosis is excellent but it really gets you thinking about your own mortality. I'd want my daughters to do whatever they needed to do to the dress if it helps them find peace and connection. If it needs to be taken apart and split between them, fine. If one wants to re-make it, then the other can do the same, even if the dress itself doesn't look like it did when I wore it anymore. To me it's about the fabric and lace etc. - they don't have to still be in the form of that dress to be special. \n\nI get that OP lost his wife... but they lost their mother.

So instead of taking the whole dress and tailoring it, maybe she had a veil the daughter could repurpose or *something* that has sentimental value while maintaining the integrity of the original dress.

A seamstress worked with my mother to take all of her favorite elements from grandma\u2019s dress, while also adding some minor tweaks that were more comfortable and appropriate for my mother (grandma had a 10+ foot long train, which my mom did not want to deal with). Both gowns were beautiful with very similar details and yet still unique to the wearer. Of course, this was the 70s and the cost of a custom dress was not quite what it would be today, but it\u2019s absolutely doable. With that being said, we can\u2019t discount the fact that the bride may very well want to wear her mother\u2019s dress because it feels like physical closeness to share the same gown, like a hug from her mom who can\u2019t be there in person.

When I read the OP, I thought, \u201cGeez. This is already going to be a somewhat bittersweet wedding. There\u2019s got to be a way to make this more sweet than bitter for everyone involved.\u201d But I probably never would have come up with that idea\u2014and THAT is the rare dopamine kick on a strong variable ratio reinforcement schedule that keeps me coming back to Reddit.", "Yep, why is it such a hard concept for people to accept that it\u2019s not for everyone. The dress doesn\u2019t require getting cut up or altering it to \u201cbring it back to life\u201d\u2014 for some people like OP, keeping the dress IS keeping it alive.", "I definitely read this in a ghost voice.", "Going up 4+ dress sizes is not *possible*. Not that\u2019s not an alteration. That\u2019s making a new dress.", "I would never, ever, ever, ever say that to anyone because I wouldn't want the kid to hear and feel any sort of pressure to use my wedding dress instead of picking her own if that's what she wanted. I'd only say anything about her using the dress if she brought up that she wanted to use it. So I don't think that argument works here, we just have no way of knowing what her feelings would be. If she'd outright said she didn't want the dress used by then, OP would've said as much, but he didn't say that, just that she assumed they'd want to shop for a dress (as is standard in my experience) and wanted to go with them for that.", "Argos: a ship bought by a merchant. One day the mast breaks, he replaces places it and throws the old one on the shore. The next season, the hull must be redone. He replaces it and throws the old pieces on the shore. In time , he has replaced every piece of his ship, and every single broken remnant is piled on the shore. Which is the Argos?", "The Argos Paradox is If an object has all its components replaced, is it the same object?\n\nSo that, but for a dress", "Ship of Theseus, same thing. \n\n\nWatch the first 5 min of John Dies at the End for a simple example. Possessed guy breaks in David kills him with an axe. Later the handle breaks, he replaces, then again later the blade is chipped too deeply, he replaces it, the possessed guy shows back up and David grabs his axe. Dead guy says \u201cThat\u2019s the axe that killed me!\u201d David stops to question, is it though?", "The Argos Paradox draw from the story/legend of Theseus, a hero of Greek mythology.\n\nIn the legend Theseus goes on a number of adventures slaying monsters and ridding the world of evil, throughout the legend, his ship The Argos, is damaged and nearly destroyed on multiple occasions, being repaired and partially rebuilt throughout the adventures.\n\nThe Argos Paradox, describes a question which asks if the Argos has been destroyed and rebuilt so many times throughout Theseus' adventure, is the Argos that arrives back in Greece at the end of the adventure the same one that departed at the start?\n\nWhat does that actually mean and represent in terms of The Argos, as well as Theseus and the crew?\n\n-----\n\nIn relation to OP's problem, the dress is an analogue to the Argos; does the dress bare the same significance and sentiment if it has been deconstructed and retailored with new parts?", "Also known as \"Trigger's Broom\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/56yN2zHtofM?si=I4LWiOUnotVAY_pL", "Yeah I\u2019ve been at it for 14 years now.

Beading is different though because you can\u2019t have beads in seams. Sizing up requires basically destroying the dress and using pieces of the original fabric to make a new dress. \n\nFor the effort and expense involved in sizing up a dress that fit a tiny person into something an average size person can wear you might as well get something new made.", "Much more commonly known as the Ship of Theseus thought experiment.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus", "Or Trigger\u2019s Broom, for any Brits out there reading this.", "If only they could have rebuilt the dog!\n\nSeriously, though, \"Argos\" just makes me immediately think of the old dog from The Odyssey."]}
