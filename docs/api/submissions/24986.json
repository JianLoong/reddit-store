You are welcome to come, but if I say no to something and you don't accept my no and ask me a second time, I will plan my future beach days to be solo.\"  If he's dug his heels in about that and still isn't receptive to change after the conversation you mention, then at least you gave it the old college try.", "It\u2019s controlling and if he makes you miserable he hopes you will stop wanting to go. He was hopeful that you would just stop talking about going and stop wanting to go without blaming him.

It\u2019s a fairly common dynamic - men generally grow up just stating what they want, and they are generally clear on what they want to do. Where women are often trained by society to be more hesitant about stating their own wants and needs, and often aren\u2019t as clear about what they are, in their own minds. \n\nIf he really wanted to do everything together, then the answer to the beach days (since they are primarily for you) would be for him to do ONLY the things that you are doing - without complaining, obviously. \n\nSo he would only be \u201callowed\u201d to go waist deep into the sea, and otherwise would only lounge & relax & enjoy the environment. \n\nIf he is not otherwise an AH and is just being annoyingly needy about the beach stuff, then this is the approach I would take. \n\nCheerfully tell him that you have thought about it, and agree that if you\u2019re doing the beach together, then you should do everything together. Then list out the activities that involves (only your stuff, with zero comprises). Remain cheerful while he expresses confusion - just keep repeating that you agree you should do everything together, but since they are your days out then it\u2019s ONLY your activities that are on the list. \n\nBe confused in return why he wants to add new stuff to that list: But that activity isn\u2019t part of \u201crelaxing beach day\u201d - if you want to create a new couples activity of \u201cactive beach day\u201d that would appeal to both of us, then by all means try to design something that we would both enjoy & we can discuss your proposal - but that would be different to my \u201crelaxing beach days\u201d. \n\nRemain cheerful & agreeable, and mildly confused  that he\u2019s not understanding all of this. \n\nWait for the penny to drop. \n\nBut obviously this will only work if he is genuinely a nice guy, not selfish most of the time, or controlling at all.

Your husband sounds exhausting. Just because you went together you have to do everything together?? Also you said you won't go to the beach with him.
