That is, he doesn't like going but he said he'd go because you like it. But then he proceeded to make the experience very unpleasant for you every time. So now you don't want to go, and he doesn't have to feel obligated to go with you. It seems like he did all this on purpose in order to avoid more beach trips in the future.", "NTA - going without him is a perfect solution he\u2019s going to behave in such a way that it you don\u2019t enjoy his company while you are there.", "NTA\n\nI've been married twice and one of the things that was most troubling was the \"we have to do all things together\" aspect of it.  I was \"forced\" into hours, days, weeks of things I didn't want to do, couldn't have a good night's sleep because moving to a room without snoring or loud AC was \"not OK cause..married\", couldn't drive separately to an event where I wanted to be for 2 hours and my husband wanted to be for 6, so we could both enjoy it - either I had to stay and be miserable or he'd throw a tantrum and say we just wouldn't go, couldn't skip a family vacation every year and choose how my one vacation a year was spent, and always accused of being bad in some way if I tried to make it so we could do things on our own so we would both be happy.\n\nYour communication seems good.  You want both of you to enjoy the things you do.  You have found a solution to a problem you are having, presented it, and if you were clear, then he's resisting it for some annoying programming he has about relationships.\n\nIf you aren't open to couples counseling (which seems to be fairly useful for things along those lines, and this seems like the perfect use for it) if you want to give one more chance you can always try a \"I'm going to the beach, I plan to do what I want with my time there.  You are welcome to come, but if I say no to something and you don't accept my no and ask me a second time, I will plan my future beach days to be solo.\"  If he's dug his heels in about that and still isn't receptive to change after the conversation you mention, then at least you gave it the old college try.", "It\u2019s controlling and if he makes you miserable he hopes you will stop wanting to go. He was hopeful that you would just stop talking about going and stop wanting to go without blaming him. Sort of trying to condition you to start finding beach trips unpleasant without being smart enough to associate negative trips with his behavior. If I am right you\u2019ll know it with an honest internal assessment of the relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s a lot. Stand by your words.

Go without him.", "NTA. For a guy who isn't a fan of the beach, he's gatekeeping the beach experience HARD.", "NTA but there\u2019s no way he is not this needy and selfish in other areas of your life together. \n\nHave a think about it - how often do you \u201chave\u201d to do whatever he wants in the moment to avoid him getting irritable?\n\nOr how often do you just go along with whatever he suggests because \u201cyou\u2019re not fussed\u201d and he states his opinion first. It\u2019s a fairly common dynamic - men generally grow up just stating what they want, and they are generally clear on what they want to do. Where women are often trained by society to be more hesitant about stating their own wants and needs, and often aren\u2019t as clear about what they are, in their own minds. \n\nIf he really wanted to do everything together, then the answer to the beach days (since they are primarily for you) would be for him to do ONLY the things that you are doing - without complaining, obviously. \n\nSo he would only be \u201callowed\u201d to go waist deep into the sea, and otherwise would only lounge & relax & enjoy the environment. \n\nIf he is not otherwise an AH and is just being annoyingly needy about the beach stuff, then this is the approach I would take. \n\nCheerfully tell him that you have thought about it, and agree that if you\u2019re doing the beach together, then you should do everything together. Then list out the activities that involves (only your stuff, with zero comprises). Remain cheerful while he expresses confusion - just keep repeating that you agree you should do everything together, but since they are your days out then it\u2019s ONLY your activities that are on the list. \n\nBe confused in return why he wants to add new stuff to that list: But that activity isn\u2019t part of \u201crelaxing beach day\u201d - if you want to create a new couples activity of \u201cactive beach day\u201d that would appeal to both of us, then by all means try to design something that we would both enjoy & we can discuss your proposal - but that would be different to my \u201crelaxing beach days\u201d. \n\nRemain cheerful & agreeable, and mildly confused  that he\u2019s not understanding all of this. \n\nWait for the penny to drop. \n\nBut obviously this will only work if he is genuinely a nice guy, not selfish most of the time, or controlling at all. Just being a bit weird on the single topic of \u201crelaxing beach days\u201d.", "NAH - you both want different things at the beach.  I'm also one that can't stand just laying on the beach and doing nothing - I need to do something to keep myself busy.\n\nMaybe find another couple to go to the beach with so you each have a friend with similar interests to hang out with and your husband can play catch or swim with someone?", "Just say 'Yes, it is my fault, so we are not going to the beach together'", "I surf my GF reads. I've tried to get her to surf, but it's not her thing. I don't understand why he won't let this go? Are there other things that he weird about? Other arguments? I definitely don't think this is the only thing.\n\nEither way NTA.", "NTA - Who cares \"who's to blame\" if you still get to go to the beach and enjoy it?  \n\nHe can stay home and mope all day.", "NTA but I don't see the problem that husband has, to be honest. If he insists you have to do everything together, that's fine. He can join you in whatever you do and just do it together with you. Why doesn't he do that? Why is he whining?", "NTA. Your husband sounds exhausting. Just because you went together you have to do everything together?? Also you said you won't go to the beach with him. How did your husband understand that both of you won't be going to the beach anymore? Why is your husband so clingy? And controlling. Introduce him to concepts of personal time and boundaries.", "NTA\n\nDude needs to let go of his expectations.  The person with the most active demands should give way to the one with the most compromises.", "Couples are not conjoint twins and can enjoy different things. NTA", "NTA\n\nalso: he really wants to watch a movie on his phone on the beach?!", "NTA. Why does he thing you have to do exactly what he is doing? He sounds immature at best and controlling at worst.", "It's sweet he wants to do things with you, but he needs to learn to let you enjoy things your way on your own. If he feels he has to be in control of every moment the two of you are together, you need to go to the beach alone. Does he want you to eat the same dish as he does every time you go out? He needs to learn to accept that it is OK to enjoy different things. \n\nHe can get a dog if he wants something to follow him everywhere, all the time. But even a dog might draw the line at deep ocean water.\n\nNTA", "Sounds like arguments I'd have with my mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 6 years old not an adult.", "NTA I\u2019ve had beach holiday like this most of us enjoyed lying on the sand just relaxing, a waist deep go in water and just chilling but one person couldn\u2019t stand \u201cdoing nothing\u201d and so itches to go super fast and wreck it for others", "NTA- Your husband's biggest brainless AH IDIOT for forcing a non swimmer goes deep into the sea that you're not comfortable with!

It's totally cool if we we each do our own thing (now that you're stuck at the beach)", "Yup, needy is the right word. And I'm sensing a compatibility issue here as well.", "Ken's a big fan of the beach though.", "Exactly, sitting around doing sod all might suit some people but spending an entire day at it over and over is bloody torture if you are fed up after 1 hour.\n\nChances are OP and her husband are on holiday together and there isn't anyone else to go and do something with and they don't get enough \"together time\" elsewhere.", "It's not much of a leap. He won't let her do what she wants and gets upset if she doesn't do what he wants. Sounds controlling to me."]}
