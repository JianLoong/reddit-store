If he can\u2019t settle down, you have no choice but to go on your own now and then, so you can get a break and relax. If he wants to do something WITH you that is a part of being together at the beach, he can massage your feet and put lotion on your back.

My husband LOVES that sandy stink pit, and I tell him to go and enjoy himself because if I go, I KNOW that I will ruin it for him.", "NTA\n\nWhat a son of a beach", "NTA but I can't help wondering if this was his plan all along. That is, he doesn't like going but he said he'd go because you like it. But then he proceeded to make the experience very unpleasant for you every time. So now you don't want to go, and he doesn't have to feel obligated to go with you. It seems like he did all this on purpose in order to avoid more beach trips in the future.", "NTA - going without him is a perfect solution he\u2019s going to behave in such a way that it you don\u2019t enjoy his company while you are there.", "NTA\n\nI've been married twice and one of the things that was most troubling was the \"we have to do all things together\" aspect of it.  I was \"forced\" into hours, days, weeks of things I didn't want to do, couldn't have a good night's sleep because moving to a room without snoring or loud AC was \"not OK cause..married\", couldn't drive separately to an event where I wanted to be for 2 hours and my husband wanted to be for 6, so we could both enjoy it - either I had to stay and be miserable or he'd throw a tantrum and say we just wouldn't go, couldn't skip a family vacation every year and choose how my one vacation a year was spent, and always accused of being bad in some way if I tried to make it so we could do things on our own so we would both be happy.\n\nYour communication seems good.  You want both of you to enjoy the things you do.  You have found a solution to a problem you are having, presented it, and if you were clear, then he's resisting it for some annoying programming he has about relationships.\n\nIf you aren't open to couples counseling (which seems to be fairly useful for things along those lines, and this seems like the perfect use for it) if you want to give one more chance you can always try a \"I'm going to the beach, I plan to do what I want with my time there.  You are welcome to come, but if I say no to something and you don't accept my no and ask me a second time, I will plan my future beach days to be solo.\"  If he's dug his heels in about that and still isn't receptive to change after the conversation you mention, then at least you gave it the old college try.", "It\u2019s controlling and if he makes you miserable he hopes you will stop wanting to go. He was hopeful that you would just stop talking about going and stop wanting to go without blaming him. Sort of trying to condition you to start finding beach trips unpleasant without being smart enough to associate negative trips with his behavior. If I am right you\u2019ll know it with an honest internal assessment of the relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s a lot. Stand by your words. Don\u2019t let his tantrum coax you into letting him come next time.", "INFO: Is your name Ken?", "NTA \n\nI would tell him, \u201cYes, if we don\u2019t go to the beach anymore it is my fault because I don\u2019t want to go with you.\u201d It takes a real asshole to ruin another adults relaxing time just because you act like a child smh he really acts like that because you won\u2019t \u201cdo what he wants\u201d!!!??", "Ummm you are blaming him\u2026. But you\u2019re NTA", "I don\u2019t think he is controlling necessarily- I think he lack empathy- he enjoys these other activities and cannot believe/imagine that she doesn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t if she tried. I shudder to think how that will work out when eg she is pregnant. NTA", "Lmao well put", "Yes he sounds very controlling", "Wild assumption tbh, but then again reddit", "He\u2019s definitely controlling of how they spend their beach days."]}
