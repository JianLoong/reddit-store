I have my daughter, Suzie, who is 3 and he has a daughter, Olivia, 16, who are both from previous marriages, and I am currently 5 months pregnant .Olivia wants to pursue a career in Baking, so she made her own cake\n\nYesterday, Olivia had hosted her own birthday celebration in the backyard with 22 of her close friends and around 13 relatives. Our backyard is relatively big, roughly 1-1/2 acres, with a pool, gazebo, and patio, so it's good for celebrations. Unfortunately, yesterday I had an appointment with Suzie that was non negotiable. I asked my husband if he could change around the time of the party, but he couldn't because Olivia's friends had to wake up early in the morning so they could go on an all day car shopping spree (Olivia didn't know this at the time). I obliged, but unfortunately I ended up being about an hour and 35 minutes late to the party. But to my surprise, when I got there the party was already wrapping up, but I got there before Olivia's new car was given to her. She was overjoyed at the new gift, and went on a test ride with her dad, with the guests telling me they had a good time. \n\nAfter the party was over and the guests had left our home, I was already pretty disappointed with the outcome but now, Suzie had began crying to me about her wanting cake. I went up to Darrel and asked him if there was any cake left for Suzie. He told me to ask Olivia. When I asked Olivia, she said \"Oh my bad, I'm pretty sure my friends took the rest of it home, but we can do something at home since you missed it?\" \n\nAt this point, I was pissed. Not only did I just miss a major event in Olivia's life, but she couldn't even save my three year old daughter a slice of cake? We began arguing and it got pretty heated. It got to the point where Olivia had told me that she was not the cake patrol, and that she had just forgot, but to me, it feels like she did this on purpose. I never see her attempt to bond with my daughter, and by now, I was fed up with her. I'm not going to argue with a 16 year old over a slice of cake. I told her to go to her room and that she was grounded, and that her shopping spree was off. Her father told me that she was crying all day today, and that we should just let her have the shopping spree. I put my feet down and told him no, but now, I feel bad and I think that maybe it was my pregnancy hormones that are affecting the way I'm perceiving things, but I also will not just stand around and let my daughter get mistreated.

She forgot and even said you could do something at the house now that you were home. It\u2019s an honest mistake. She wasn\u2019t disrespecting anyone or mistreating them. \n\nShe\u2019s 16, her interests are far different than a 3 year olds. Of course she doesn\u2019t want to spend tons of time with her! \n\nYou went evil stepmom and took away her birthday shopping gift and grounded her after screaming at her over a slice of cake.", "YTA\n\nSo you're not going to argue with a 16 year old over a slice of cake so you just grounded her for it? And still argued about it? Way to become the wicked stepmom in one fell swoop.", "YTA. It was her party and she's absolutely right; she's not on cake patrol. You're being petty, childish, and overall ridiculous!\n\nFurther, your daughter wasn't mistreated. Your stepdaughter was mistreated. By you.", "So your 16 year old stepdaughter was hosting a birthday party for herself with 35 people in attendance, but her main focus was making sure your three year old didn't get a slice of cake? And when the mistake was pointed out to her she offered to try to make it up to you and your daughter with a little party? \n\nAnd your three year old and your 16 year old stepdaughter are not best friends so she must be out to get her? So you retaliate by taking away a shopping trip?\n\nYTA. A huge one.", "YTA. She made her own cake, hosted her own party, and you missed it. It was HER birthday. And her cake. Grounding her and refusing to let her have her shopping spree as planned was way out of line and you owe her an apology, a big one. \n\nYou say you weren\u2019t going to argue with a 16 year old over a slice of cake, but that is exactly what you did. \n\nDid it ever occur to you that you could have taken your daughter out for a treat? She\u2019s 3 for goodness sakes. She would been thrilled.\n\nYou\u2019ve got some apologizing to do, YTA", "YTA. Congratulations, you ruined Olivia's Sweet 16 over a piece of fucking cake.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't even think to *ask* Olivia to save a piece of cake for you and/or Suzie but you're enraged that she didn't magically remember on her own? She's a 16 year old girl who was having fun with her friends on *her* birthday which is not about you or Suzie. Saving cake was not a priority nor should it have been.\n\nEvil stepmother is right on here.", "YTA. Evil step mom vibes strong here.", "Info: Yesterday was Friday.  Did your stepdaughter and her friends and her relatives and you and your husband all have the day off work and school to attend this birthday party on a Friday morning?\n\nIf this really happened, YTA.  Your SD didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "YTA. It\u2019s fucking cake, she offered to make something special for her stepsister to make up for it, and you\u2019re being horrible to her because a 16 year old isn\u2019t conforming to your fantasy of a perfect blended family.", "YTA You had nothing to do with helping her with the party, and you threw a toddler tantrum over a piece of cake.\n\nBy the way, you timeliness indicates you have issues with with waiting and getting your way.", "YTA.  It was your stepdaughter's day, and you ruined it.  She should not have to make her birthday party revolve around you and your daughter.  Hell, your teenage daughter acted more mature than you did.  She offered a compromise by doing something with you and your daughter since you missed the party.  That was not good enough for you.", " YTA, your step daughter offered to do something together when you all got home, that would be a perfect opportunity to bond together as a family. Instead you took the petty option and grounded her for not holding onto any leftover cake? Which is a small over site at best.", "YTA. You\u2019re not entitled to cake. If you wanted it, then you should\u2019ve booked the appointment on another day. Your entitlement is INSANE. This day was not about you.", "**YTA**\\- All I'm getting from this is that YOU don't like your stepdaughter very much. You and your husband decided to get married, not your stepdaughter or daughter. You're acting like it's HER fault that you decided to miss part of her 16th birthday. If you genuinely felt that bad that you wanted to be there you wouldn't be throwing a toddler tantrum over a slice of cake. The fact that your stepdaughter offered to do something at home for your daughter to make it up to her shows that she doesn't have a malicious intent.\n\n16 year old girls with 22 friends at her party aren't worried about making a baby cry, and the fact she gave HER cake to her friends to take home shows how selfless she is. Most people keep the cake. You are making a very selfish decision. **Did it ever occur to you that your stepdaughter doesn't bond with your daughter because you're making her feel like she's forced to?**", "INFO: what kind of appointment was this? Like a visit to the doctor or something? I\u2019m confused about why scheduling was an issue in the first place, because a party is usually planned well in advance. And if you knew you were going to miss some of the party, did you ask them to save some cake for you and your daughter? This seems like a very last minute thing - the way it\u2019s written makes it seem like you woke up and realized you had an appointment and left.", "For real? Yup, YTA stepmommy dearest", "YTA \n\nShe's a teenager that didn't remember to save cake for a 3 year old while she was hosting 35 other guests. It also sounds like she was offering to make another cake and have a family celebration that could include you and your daughter. You had the opportunity there to be an adult and make a nice family moment but you chose to act like a child instead.", "You acted like a bratty teenager because a genuine teenager\u2019s offer to make something for your daughter wasn\u2019t good enough. YTA", "Your 16 year old stepdaughter is not responsible for making your daughter happy. If you wanted to ensure there was cake left you should have appointed an adult to take care of that. If you want them to bond, talk to your husband about how to facilitate that. If they haven't bonded, that's on you and your husband for either doing a crappy job of blending families or for having unreasonable expectations of what it would look like. You've now ensured that when your stepdaughter sees or thinks about you, the first association will be you taking away her birthday celebration with friends because she didn't revolve her life around your daughter. Real wicked stepmother material. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nThis was a large party and Olivia was the birthday girl and she had to host her own party. She not only baked her own cake she is also correct that she was not on cake patrol. She was suppose to be having fun. Not only did you make her birthday about your three year old, you grounded her for not ensuring your kid had a slice of cake AFTER she offered to bake something else (again on her birthday). You could have offered to bake something and made a fun evening of it with both girls but you chose the opposite road and ruined Olivia's birthday and her shopping spree.", "Lol. So you're \"not gonna argue with a 16 year old over a slice of cake\"...but you'll ground her over one?\n\nYTA.", "Yta your daughter wasn\u2019t mistreated and it\u2019s ridiculous for you, an adult to try and reach for the claim of \u201cpregnancy hormones\u201d as an excuse but you already know this.", "YTA, what? The guests ate the cake, and you grounded her? You missed her party, and that is some how her fault and you are mad at her? Wow, lady, just wow!", "YTA and a horrible stepmom\u2026 you had an outburst because your precious little daughter didn\u2019t get a piece of birthday cake.\n\nOlivia even offered to make up for it but you had a little temper tantrum like a child\u2026 also if you knew the party was that day, why would you book an appointment for the time the party is on.. that\u2019s poor and irresponsible planning on your part.\n\nAlso your husband is an AH as well for letting you ground his daughter without discussing it with him first\u2026 he sucks just as much as you do, no way I would let any partner of mine treat my daughter like trash, especially someone that hasn\u2019t been in her life for that long as well.\n\nBloody disgusting behaviour on your part, I hope you realise you messed up badly and make it up to Olivia. You will be the reason that Olivia goes NC when she\u2019s 18 and has nothing to do with you or her dad\u2026.", "YTA. If you wanted cake saved for your daughter, you should have used your words and asked for cake to be saved. You are supposed to be the adult in this situation.", "You should feel bad, because you punished a child for no good reason. Not her fault you have a stick up your ass about your kid. It's cake and a party get over it.\n\nYTA and you owe her an apology. Don't expect her to have any respect for you after this. Her father is also TA for letting you do it.", "YTA. Sounds like the party was scheduled first. \n\nYou decided to set up a conflicting appointment. Somehow you thought should mean that the original party (which it doesn\u2019t sound like you were helping with) should be rearranged. \n\nThen you got even pissier because by the time you got back the party was over and the cake was all gone. And then, even though Olivia had offered to do something else, you decide that\u2019s not good enough, the whole situation is Olivia\u2019s fault, and you ground her for it. So much for not arguing over a slice of cake.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Now it\u2019s Olivia\u2019s fault that you missed the party, that she and your daughter haven\u2019t bonded, that everything that happened was on purpose, that she is mistreating your daughter.\n\nYes you are blowing things out of proportion. Do better.", "YTA. Olivia is 16 and preoccupied with her friends and her birthday. You didn't ask anyone to save you cake so you can't expect that Olivia or your boyfriend would save you a piece. It's cake. You can just go to the store and get Suzie a slice.", "Yta, and a major one at that.  Your stepdaughter hosted her own party, made her own cake, but didn\u2019t save your 3 year old slice of cake so you ground her.  You\u2019re not her parent and have no business punishing her. Your husband should have stepped in and stood up for his daughter.  Don\u2019t blame your attitude and behavior on your pregnancy.  You just have this sense of entitlement, like Olivia should\u2019ve saved my daughter a slice of cake instead of hosting her party and having fun.  You didn\u2019t help with anything for this party.  I wouldn\u2019t blame Olivia if she keeps her distance from you moving forth.\n\nThe only one mistreated was Olivia not your 3 year old.  Do better.", "YTA wow I hate to see what happens to her when the baby is born. \n\nGod I hope she does not live with you. You are a horrible stepmother. \n\nWhy did you not ask your husband to save your kid some cake why was that her responsibility\n\nGREAT job of ruining a 16 year old bday. SHE will remember this FOREVER. ALL because your 3 year old did not get any cake. \n\nSHAME ON YOU", "YTA \n\nYou genuinely think that saving a piece of cake was on your daughters mind at her birthday party with 22 friends and 13 relatives?\n\nThis seems petty and narcissistic.  You didn\u2019t make it on time so you\u2019re punishing her?\n\nYou own her an apology.  You just created a negative memory she\u2019ll remember about you for life over a slice of cake.", "No way this is real.", "YTA.  She had 35 people there and was celebrating her birthday.  I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t think twice about your daughter and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  It was her day.  It sounds like you didn\u2019t think about your daughter getting cake either until she mentioned it.  She then offered a solution which you blew off and grounded her instead.  It was a huge overreaction which may or may not be attributable to pregnancy hormones but you\u2019ve been pregnant before and should know to be on the lookout.  Apologize and offer to make it up to her.", "Yes, YTA. Your daughter was absolutely not being mistreated. On the contrary, you are mistreating your stepdaughter. Your scheduling issues are your problem and it seems you were already so angry that your husband wouldn\u2019t change the plans of around 35 other people to suit you that you were angling for a fight. And your daughter missed out on cake because of you, which is really not a big deal. I really hope it was pregnancy hormones that made you behave so abominably because hopefully you\u2019ll eventually be able to see how terribly you\u2019ve treated your stepdaughter and come up with an apology. YTA.", "YTA. Are you serious? \nYou realise not everything is about your kid, right?", "Oh yes YTA. And if your husband goes along with it, he is too. A kids 16th b-day is a huge day in their life, and it rightfully should be ALL ABOUT THEM. You ruined that for your stepdaughter. \" You're not going to see your daughter get mistreated\" it wasn't her birthday!!!!", "Yta, what is wrong with you? She is not mistreating your daughter. You are the one who is mistreating her you should Apologise to her", "YTA. Horrible stepmom.", "YTA\n\nShe was enjoying her party, not patrolling the cake table. You scheduled a doctor\u2019s appointment for your daughter on her birthday. If you miss the birthday party, you aren\u2019t guaranteed cake. You could\u2019ve sent your husband a text and asked him to grab a slice for you when it was cut. Does missing her party mean you aren\u2019t trying to make a connection with her? Should someone yell at you for missing her birthday? Or was it a simple oversight? Your daughter is 3. Not many 16 year olds are running to hang out with 3 years old. She offered a reasonable alternative. You just want to be mad.", "What kind of teenager is going to want to spend her birthday thinking about her 3 year old stepsister? What do you think a teenager and a toddler could possibly have in common?\n\nIt was an honest mistake, get over it. YTA", "Really curious what this \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d appointment that could only take place that day and time was", "YTA it\u2019s a piece of cake it wasn\u2019t necessary to ground her for not saving any. Plus she\u2019s 16 she\u2019s thinking about boys her friends and probably makeup not bonding with a 3 yr old. Enjoy these last few yrs with her being home once she\u2019s gone she\u2019s gone don\u2019t let the memories be tainted by a piece of cake.", "YTA\n\nThis could have been a good learning moment for your three year old. Sometimes mistakes happen, and that's okay. The 16 year old offered to do something separately to include you guys. It's not as if she maliciously planned her party around your schedule to prevent you from coming. You majorly overreacted. \n\nI expect a few years from now we'll see a post from you wondering why your stepdaughter went LC or NC with you. Apologize.", "Wow, stepmom of the year right here. \nYou had no right to do that. It was petty and nasty. You and her dad both owe her an apology.\n\nYTA", "It's unanimous, YTA. So how are you going to go about apologizing to Olivia and making it up to her?", "YTA With everything going on it would have been very easy for your daughter to not pay attention to what was happening with any leftover cake. \n\nIf you're upset with anyone, it should be your husband. He was the parent in charge and should have been overseeing everything. \n\nYou blew this completely out of proportion. If getting cake and being a part of the celebration was so important to you, you should have prioritized attending. You are really doing a disservice by not explaining what appointment you felt was so important that you couldn't have rescheduled it. \n\nYour SD could be the one arguing that you didn't think her birthday was important and aren't making enough of an effort to make her feel that she's a priority to you.", "YTA \n\nWhen looking for your next husband, I advise you to look for one without kids. I'm going to tell you that Susie will never be his. He will love Olivia and the new one differently. You mistreating/pushing away his first child will  be the reason he leaves you. \n\nYou messed up majorly. Blaming pregnancy hormones for crying over cake, grounding her and taking away her shopping spree is just sad. Also putting your feet down on a decision for a kid that's not yours is an ultimatum that I hope your husband does not abide by or he is also an AH.", "YTA. Olivia doesn't owe your daughter cake. The fact that you grounded her over something so stupid is beyond AH move. Also, she made her own damn cake! It was not your cake that you made or bought. Give your 3 year old a cookie or something, she'll be fine. You are a huge AH though! So bad, congrats you made it to AM I the Devil sub \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. It was her birthday and not yours. You should have asked your husband to save a piece of cake. You shouldn\u2019t expect a child to do it. The term Evil Stepmother comes to mind reading your post.", "YTA. \n\n16 year olds are selfish, which is developmentally normal. She\u2019s not the cake patrol. She\u2019s a 16 year old with a 3 year old step sister, and it\u2019s not really her responsibility to try to bond with her or save her cake. Would it be nice if she tried to bond? Of course. Will that happen organically as time passes? Probably. But 16 and 3, those ages are pretty different and bonding is not going to be quick or easy, simply because of the age gap. You ruined her birthday celebrations with her friends\u2026.because she didnt set aside a piece of cake for your kid. Oh, and it sounds like you left her dad out of the disciplinary action, which isn\u2019t really cool IMO.", "Move on adult", "YTA and you owe your stepdaughter a massive and sincere apology if you don't want to permanently damage that relationship. You messed up by missing her party and then took your frustrations out on her. In no world is your step daughter at fault for not saving a piece of cake for someone who missed their party. Sure, it's not your 3 year old's fault, but it also is not your step daughter's fault at all. Again, please apologize to her and make up the shopping spree.", "YTA! Another evil step mother! Olivia doesnt owe you anything. Get your shit together and apologize to her.", "YTA, what a cruel step mother you are, she baked her own cake, hosted her own party, and you missed it and then you send her to her room cause in all the excitement of getting  car she forgot to save any of her cake but says she'll make it up(likely by making a whole new cake) and you go poop on her 16th birthday and send her to her room and tell her she can't celebrate her birthday anymore and go out with her friends. You know that 16th birthday only comes once right? How are you going to make this up to her? She ain't going to be getting another 16th birthday again. Yep, i don't see her having any further bonding with your child from here on out.", "YTA  \n\n\nShe didn't sound like she was excluding her step-sister on purpose. And your punishment is extremely disproportionate. She's sixteen, and she doesn't have to put her life on hold to wait for you. It's just a cake, and it's one she made herself. For HER birthday. And you punished her for it? You took away a shopping trip over a slice of cake! Of course you're the asshole. And you think this won't make her resent you and your daughter?", "YTA! \n\nIt\u2019s not Olivia\u2019s fault you or Suzie didn\u2019t come to the party, (if this was such a \u201cmajor event in Olivia\u2019s life\u201d then why\u2019d you miss it? Lol) and you never told her you wanted her to save you guys some cake\u2026and thinking that your 3 yr old daughter is getting mistreated for not having cake is actually comical. \n\nIt seems like you show favoritism towards Suzie opposed to Olivia. I really don\u2019t feel like you should have any part in Olivia\u2019s parenting/discipline either\u2026especially if you act like this. That should be between your husband and Olivia\u2019s mother. \n\nHave you even made any effort to have a good relationship with Olivia? Also it\u2019s pretty normal for a 16 yr old to not have any interest in becoming \u201cfriends\u201d with a 3 yr old\u2026like come on. This honestly seemed like a very normal situation and you just blew it waaayyy out of proportion.", "YTA and so is your husband for allowing his cruel wife to ground his daughter over a stupid reason. If you\u2019re wanting to drive your step daughter completely out of your husband\u2019s life, this is a good first step. He\u2019s an AH if he doesn\u2019t kick you to the curb or at the very least set you straight.", "YTA you suck op your husband needs to leave your ass", "YTA. You ruined her 16th birthday with your entitled, abusive behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous of you to expect her to bond with a toddler who isn\u2019t her sibling. Your kid is nothing to Olivia but an inconvenience she has to tolerate until she leaves home. If you wanted Suzie to have step-siblings close enough in age to bond with, you should have married someone in your age bracket. \n\nIt\u2019s even more ridiculous to expect her to save a piece of cake for your kid. Why wouldn\u2019t that be your husband\u2019s responsibility? Olivia isn\u2019t the one who brought you two into their household. She doesn\u2019t owe anything to you or your kid, and was far kinder about your self-centered demands than she had any duty to be. I bet she won\u2019t make that mistake again.\n\nYour husband is an even bigger asshole for letting you mistreat his daughter. You should have zero say over whether Olivia goes on a shopping trip, or anything else having to do with Olivia for that matter. It\u2019s his job to protect her from you. Fingers crossed that Olivia can at least get away from you by going to her mom\u2019s house.", "r/amithedevil", "YTA\n\nA big one.\n\nDon\u2019t blame your pregnancy - you\u2019re just a witch", "YTA.

You had to ask reddit to get the obvious answer? Of course you're the AH. Putting aside you think she's under some obligation to bond with your kid, she's most definitely not the cake patrol. If it was anyone's job to save some cake, that job should have fallen to step-dad and you should most definitely not unilaterally grounded her without even a discussion with her FATHER and MOTHER. Do you think your adult tantrum is actually going to bring the kids closer together or be a source of resentment?\n\nYTA", "Yeah YTA. She planned her OWN bday party probably got too busy to think about saving a piece of cake for your child. Grow up. Seriously. I'm pretty sure she can't wait till she turns 18 so she can have some peace. You sound exhausting.", "YTA\n\nHow is any of this the fault of a 16 year old child instead of the adults involved?\n\nAll you had to do was send someone to the store to buy a cupcake for your kid, or I don't know, accept Olivia's offer to bake a simple one at home.\n\nInstead you chose to act out your fantasy as the wicked stepmother.\n\nOlivia deserves one hell of an apology for this crap.  Clearly you husband should not be allowing you to have any parental authority over her if you blow a gasket over a slice of cake and a 3 year old that doesn't know the difference between a professional birthday cake and a hostess Twinkie.", "YTA\n\nThis isn't about you.  You're not the main character in everyone's life.  \n\nYou missed the party.  I know, it sucks, but I'm sorry that the schedule of the birthday girl is more important than yours, but that's how parties work.  The birthday girl is the focus, not you.\n\nAnd while it sucks that the cake was gone, Olivia offered to do something special for you and her stepsister.  Instead of once again, understanding that you're not the main character here, you blow up at her because once again you think that everyone should be constantly focused on your needs.\n\nQuite frankly, it simply sounds like you're mad that the day wasn't catered to you more than anything else.\n\nAnd pregnancy hormones are not an excuse to be an absolute ghoul to a girl who OFFERED TO MAKE YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER SOMETHING SPECIAL ON HER OWN BIRTHDAY.\n\nSeriously.  Really think about that.  This girl was nice enough to offer to make something special, just for you and your daughter, on HER, not yours, HER birthday, and you decided to act like an utter ghoul to her.\n\nI hope you still have time to reconsider because not only will this destroy any relationship Olivia has with you, but also strain her relationship with her stepsister.", "YTA.\n\nIt's her birthday. She doesn't owe anybody jack shit on HER day, and she even offered to do something at home with you guys since you missed it.", "Wow YTA without a doubt. You owe Olivia an apology.", "YTA and don't be surprised when Olivia moves out in 2 years and rarely comes back.\n\nShe'll go out of her way to meet her dad outside of the home, so she can avoid you.

And lets be honest here, you could have bought a cheap cake at the store and given it whole to your 3yo. She wouldn't even notice the difference.  \n2- Your daughter is not entitled to a relationship with Olivia. With a 13 years age gap is pretty difficult to connect.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nBackground: I, (34F) am a SAHM to my husband Darrel (46M) and we have been married for over a year. I have my daughter, Suzie, who is 3 and he has a daughter, Olivia, 16, who are both from previous marriages, and I am currently 5 months pregnant .Olivia wants to pursue a career in Baking, so she made her own cake\n\nYesterday, Olivia had hosted her own birthday celebration in the backyard with 22 of her close friends and around 13 relatives. Our backyard is relatively big, roughly 1-1/2 acres, with a pool, gazebo, and patio, so it's good for celebrations. Unfortunately, yesterday I had an appointment with Suzie that was non negotiable. I asked my husband if he could change around the time of the party, but he couldn't because Olivia's friends had to wake up early in the morning so they could go on an all day car shopping spree (Olivia didn't know this at the time). I obliged, but unfortunately I ended up being about an hour and 35 minutes late to the party. But to my surprise, when I got there the party was already wrapping up, but I got there before Olivia's new car was given to her. She was overjoyed at the new gift, and went on a test ride with her dad, with the guests telling me they had a good time. \n\nAfter the party was over and the guests had left our home, I was already pretty disappointed with the outcome but now, Suzie had began crying to me about her wanting cake. I went up to Darrel and asked him if there was any cake left for Suzie. He told me to ask Olivia. When I asked Olivia, she said \"Oh my bad, I'm pretty sure my friends took the rest of it home, but we can do something at home since you missed it?\" \n\nAt this point, I was pissed. Not only did I just miss a major event in Olivia's life, but she couldn't even save my three year old daughter a slice of cake? We began arguing and it got pretty heated. It got to the point where Olivia had told me that she was not the cake patrol, and that she had just forgot, but to me, it feels like she did this on purpose. I never see her attempt to bond with my daughter, and by now, I was fed up with her. I'm not going to argue with a 16 year old over a slice of cake. I told her to go to her room and that she was grounded, and that her shopping spree was off. Her father told me that she was crying all day today, and that we should just let her have the shopping spree. I put my feet down and told him no, but now, I feel bad and I think that maybe it was my pregnancy hormones that are affecting the way I'm perceiving things, but I also will not just stand around and let my daughter get mistreated.

You canceled something she was really looking forward to because a 3 year old didn't get a piece of cake on someone's birthday.

With the amount of friends and family you noted coming to the party, I imagine most of any food provided, including cake, was long gone.

Go buy your kid a cupcake.  You were late to her party, and not by a little bit, but somehow you're surprised the party was wrapping up by the time you finally showed up?  You expected there to still be cake after 35 people had their go at it?  And hey, you missed a major event in her life but you repaid her by absolutely ruining her 16th birthday.  She'll never forget (or forgive) that.  Your daughter was not mistreated.  However you mistreated your husband's daughter.   Been married for less than two years and you pull this stunt.  Good luck with the next years, you're going to need it.  Also, she has no need to 'bond with your daughter'.

She is 16. Still a child, not an adult. She actually offered up a very reasonable solution and you got mad anyway. I'm sure pregnancy hormones are clouding your vision on this one.

No need to have a relationship with you in the future.", "I feel this is a lot of info missing. How far in advance was the party planned vs your appointment?

It sounds like your stepdaughter offered a good compromise of celebrating at home, but you acted out.", "Yta a 3 year old and A 15 year old won\u2019t bond like that. As well your hormones were intense. Relax", "YTA. I mean, seriously. \"I'm not going to argue with a 16 year old over a slice of cake.\" That would be hilarious if you weren't so mean. How about not arguing with a 3 year old? Why couldn't you hug and kiss her and tell her gently that there just was no more cake? Ah, probably pregnancy hormones. /s", "YTA \n\nYou ruined a huge milestone for your stepdaughter. For the rest of her life, she\u2019ll remember that her sweet 16 was ruined by her stepmother. And that her father didn\u2019t defend her. I can\u2019t imagine how you can salvage any kind of relationship with her now. Hopefully her father will come to his senses and make it up to her.\n\nAlso, consider that your reputation as an evil stepmother is cemented with everyone who went to that party. At least she\u2019ll have the support of her friends and family. \n\nEven though I didn\u2019t really add any new points, I wanted to add to the numbers so you can\u2019t delude yourself that you were anything but cruel and unreasonable.", "YTA. You couldn't show up to her party, got there after it ended, and grounded her for sharing her cake with her friends.

The one who missed her party.", "YTA, and really it should have been your husbands job to make sure a piece of cake was saved for the 3 y/o not the birthday girls. Also why couldn\u2019t the appt for the younger one be rescheduled? You didn\u2019t prioritize properly and that\u2019s on you not your step daughter. You owe her a huge apology, an explanation about pregnancy hormones, and a cake she doesn\u2019t have to bake herself. Unless you\u2019re going for the evil stepmom vibe.
