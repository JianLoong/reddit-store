{"id": 12765, "submission_id": "11wmp03", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she was being ridiculous over a school project?", "selftext": "   \n\n\nMy (37f) sister (34f) is married to her husband (33m) and they have 7 kids in total, 3 kids from my sister\u2019s first marriage (16f, 15f, 12m), her husband has 3 kids from his old marriage (15f, 14m and 11m) and they have one son together (5m), and are currently found out they are having another. \n\nThe 5 year old, Jackson, is in Kindergarten and recently did an All About Me type of project, the ones that kids list their favorite things.  On this sheet, they included \u201cMy Hero\u201d as well. On the sheet, he put my sister\u2019s middle stepchild, who would be Jackson\u2019s 14 year old half brother, Boston. He also mentioned Boston\u2019s friends.\n\nFor context, my sister is a stay at home mom, only her husband works, they had an agreement to not try to force relationships too hard, especially because her husband experienced that as a child. \n\nMost of the kids don\u2019t spend too much time with Jackson and never have, especially given the age gap between them. Boston however was always very excited when they announced they were having a baby, and Boston always spent a lot of time with him, Boston\u2019s friends did as well as they frequently go to each other's houses. Boston and his friends are all athletes, doing various sports at the middle school. Boston still is a teenage boy, and he clashes with his bio siblings quite frequently, he\u2019s very nice and a sweet boy but has a lot of energy and is very opinionated. \n\nJackson, like Boston has shown an interest in sports, this makes them closer as Boston is the only kid out of the 6 older ones who plays sports. Jackson has done soccer + baseball.\n\nThe issue is how my sister reacted to Jackson putting Boston + friends as his hero, I was at her house helping her bring in furniture she bought at the store for the new baby when we went to pick up Jackson. He gave her the project after we walked in the door. She started asking him about the hero part and he was talking about how Boston and his friends are cool and how he wants to be like them when he grows up.\n\nAfter Jackson went in his room, my sister was talking about how he was \u201cungrateful\u201d, she said she could understand why Boston was there but went on about his friends being there, saying stuff like \u201cdid Boston\u2019s friends ever change his diaper?\u201d, and \u201cdid they ever feed him?\u201d. She went on to say maybe she\u2019d need to have Jackson spend less time with Boston and his friends. \n\nI told her to stop being ridiculous and that Jackson is just a kid and he\u2019s allowed to put who he  wants on his project and that she should know that he loves her and her husband. She argued with me for a bit until we got back to dealing with the baby furniture and I thought everything was good. \n\nHowever, later in the day I got a call from our parents telling me that I should apologize to my sister and they said I was being an \u201casshole\u201d and a \u201cjerk\u201d for telling her she was overreacting, however when I told my husband about it he agreed with me.

Sis is definitely overreacting.", "NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous. If she feels under-appreciated by her family, she needs to discuss that with her husband and hopefully her therapist. \n\nLashing out at a little boy for admiring his big brother and his friends is absolutely ridiculous. And wanting to punish the kid by limiting the time he spends with them is a total AH move. \n\nDo not apologize.", "NTA. My kinder kid said Batman was his hero. I asked my prek kid and they said unicorns. At least her kid put a real person. Kids are gonna put some weird stuff in school work at that age.", "I fucking hate when parents call their kids \u201cungrateful\u201d. \n\nJackson didn\u2019t ask to be born. That little boy doesn\u2019t owe your sister shit! \n\nShe was, indeed, being ridiculous.", "NTA wow that\u2019s ridiculous he\u2019s a kid. I hope she knows she won\u2019t be cool until he\u2019s about 30", "NTA. You are so far from being the asshole here. Your sister is basically complaining that her 5-year old son actually likes and looks up to his older brother. And, for once, it's a great story about how the older brother's friends are also supportive of, again, a literal 5-year old. \n\nI don't know what kind of trip your sister is on, but her dragging your parents into it makes her overeaction even more extreme. I wish I had some advice for you. But, I've never known anyone IRL who was jealous of a relationship between literal children within the same family. \n\nSo, at least complete strangers approve of your message - if that's worth anything.", "NTA\n\nAlso, and this is a personal bias, it's impossible for me to assess the situation and not take into  account all those ages. She'll be a 36-year-old grandmother if the pattern holds. This makes me question everyone's emotional development and decision-making abilities.", "NTA. She was indeed ridiculous.  And it doesn't sound like you told her that to be mean, just hoping to snap her into reality.  Sadly,  it obviously didn't work.", "NTA. She's gatekeeping her kids' heroes. That sounds like helicopter mom behavior, bordering on narcissist/control issues she's having.\n\nIt sounds like there's going to be another baby after this one she's currently pregnant with if she can't stand to see her children grow up and become individuals.", "NTA: first of all it is beautiful and wonderful that he has such a close relationship with an older step ( or half?) sibling. It's good you stood up for that relationship.  Also,  with 8 kids now I'm sure that older brother is more present than his mom is able to be.  She should be grateful he is giving him the attention he needs, not petty.", "NTA Jackson loving his brother makes so much sense. Kids don't (and really shouldn't) understand what parents do for them \"behind the scenes\" until later in life. Alsi, expecting a 5 yr old to be thankful for mom doing the bare minimum is a bit insane.", "NTA. Your sister had a very odd and unreasonable reaction to her son's project. If anything, she should be overjoyed that he named his bro as his hero. He's FIVE FFS - she expects this project to be an existential show of gratitude toward her for raising him? Absolutely  not - that is not remotely reasonable and you were right for suggesting she change her attitude towards it. \n\nHard to say whether your delivery brought you into AH land, if you were a real jerk in how you spoke to her maybe, but the sentiment you had is right.", "NTA\n\nIt actually quite sweet that a five-year-old boy would say that his older brother is his hero, and his older brother and his friends seem to be really good kids who deserve this.\n\nNo five-year-old cares about who changed their diapers when they were a baby.", "NTA. As a mom of four I found this heartwarming.", "Sister is grabbing defeat from the jaws of victory.  When 2 siblings like each other, that is a parenting win!  NTA", "NTA. Pregnancy hormones. She's feeling left out cause the baby is growing up.", "NTA, your sister is though. Sounds like she could use a hobby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seriously there should be statutes honouring what women do for children in every town square on the planet.  \n\nInstead - men and boys are taught to consider football player and soldier to be heroic.
