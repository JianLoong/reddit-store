On this sheet, they included \u201cMy Hero\u201d as well. On the sheet, he put my sister\u2019s middle stepchild, who would be Jackson\u2019s 14 year old half brother, Boston. He also mentioned Boston\u2019s friends.\n\nFor context, my sister is a stay at home mom, only her husband works, they had an agreement to not try to force relationships too hard, especially because her husband experienced that as a child. \n\nMost of the kids don\u2019t spend too much time with Jackson and never have, especially given the age gap between them. Boston however was always very excited when they announced they were having a baby, and Boston always spent a lot of time with him, Boston\u2019s friends did as well as they frequently go to each other's houses. Boston and his friends are all athletes, doing various sports at the middle school. Boston still is a teenage boy, and he clashes with his bio siblings quite frequently, he\u2019s very nice and a sweet boy but has a lot of energy and is very opinionated. \n\nJackson, like Boston has shown an interest in sports, this makes them closer as Boston is the only kid out of the 6 older ones who plays sports. Jackson has done soccer + baseball.\n\nThe issue is how my sister reacted to Jackson putting Boston + friends as his hero, I was at her house helping her bring in furniture she bought at the store for the new baby when we went to pick up Jackson. He gave her the project after we walked in the door. She started asking him about the hero part and he was talking about how Boston and his friends are cool and how he wants to be like them when he grows up.\n\nAfter Jackson went in his room, my sister was talking about how he was \u201cungrateful\u201d, she said she could understand why Boston was there but went on about his friends being there, saying stuff like \u201cdid Boston\u2019s friends ever change his diaper?\u201d, and \u201cdid they ever feed him?\u201d. She went on to say maybe she\u2019d need to have Jackson spend less time with Boston and his friends. \n\nI told her to stop being ridiculous and that Jackson is just a kid and he\u2019s allowed to put who he  wants on his project and that she should know that he loves her and her husband. She argued with me for a bit until we got back to dealing with the baby furniture and I thought everything was good. \n\nHowever, later in the day I got a call from our parents telling me that I should apologize to my sister and they said I was being an \u201casshole\u201d and a \u201cjerk\u201d for telling her she was overreacting, however when I told my husband about it he agreed with me.
