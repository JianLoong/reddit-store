I live with my dad as of recently and so I came home about 5 hours ago to visit for Christmas. (Note that my dad lives in another state over 5 hours away) I stay with my grandma when I come to visit, but my moms house is a block away. When I got home I tried to call my mom to see if we were going to dinner. Instead she tells me that she\u2019s going to stay the weekend with her bf. My whole attitude changed when she said that. I started being a bitch and was being rude. I know I shouldn\u2019t have but I hadn\u2019t seen her in months.  My mom picked me up so we could hangout for a minute before she left. Also note (her bf is 57 and lives over an hour away in another state) well everything was dandy until we all were walking up on the porch when he corners me to where I can\u2019t escape and they were laughing at me. I\u2019m talking he was so close he could touch my ass. Well men make me uncomfortable. He has made all sorts on comments on my ass and tits. So I start try to move and I realized that my dogs water bowl is under me, so I kicked it and got his pants wet. He backs off and we walk into the house. My mom said \u201cwhy did you do that\u201d and I responded \u201cif your in my space and won\u2019t back off you are going to get fucked up\u201d so I go to my grandmas and an hour later when I\u2019m hanging out with my guy bsf and grandma, her bf decide to text me this \u201cYour tattoo has been cancelled on my end ,I will not Tolerate your disposition around me you have no respect for others and you're only out for yourself so until you can show me different I will not try and do anything for you\u201d. That made me made mad and for reference I\u2019m getting a memorial tattoo for my dead sister. So I texted my mom and started to tell her how I really felt. I told her basically that I was done with her bullshit and that she puts her bf before me which is 100% true and everyone knows it. I told her I was done begging for her attention like I\u2019m 5 years old and she needs to decide if she wants to be in my life or not, and I told her that she sees him every fucking weekend and that she needs to take one weekend to spend it with me because I don\u2019t see her everyday. Now I feel like an asshole and I\u2019ve been getting text from parts of my family that I was harsh and I hurt her feelings. I know I could\u2019ve been nicer and just ignored the situation but I\u2019m not sure. I feel like I was being a little harsh and I could\u2019ve said everything I wanted to say with a calmer tone.
