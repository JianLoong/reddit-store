I am very close to my 1st cousin 23F and she is one of my bridesmaids.  9Years ago her dad, my uncle, 50M got remarried to her step mom. My cousin does not like her step mom and I have only had a handful of interactions with the step mom over the past 9 years. I did meet the step brother one time years ago however, I have spoken to him only one other time since when he randomly showed up at my sisters reception uninvited. \n\nSo I decided I would only invite my uncle and his wife to the wedding and not the step son. This came up in conversation with my grandmother 70F and she demanded that I give them another invite for the step brother. She has not contributed any money to my wedding and she has made it very clear she does not like my fianc\u00e9. So I told her I will not be inviting him and if he shows up there will not be a seat or food for him (we are having a food truck and only purchased enough tickets for the people invited). \n\nShe then started to yell at me and told me I was being unreasonable and needed to get over myself and that it isn\u2019t just about me. She then tried to ask my fianc\u00e9 and he also said no. She has now been complaint about me to the rest of the family. So AITA?\n\nEdit: The step brother is 32 and does not live with the uncle and step mother. My cousin does not have a close relationship with him either. The relationship between my uncle and mom is strained because of some bad choices he made years ago that rubbed her and my dad the wrong way but that is not my story. The wedding is very small to start with and there will only be 55 people including myself and fianc\u00e9. There is a lot of other family that is not invited because I have not seen them in 10+ years and would not be comfortable inviting them. \n\nAlso, my fianc\u00e9s parents and my fianc\u00e9 and I are the only ones paying for the wedding. No money is being given from my side of the family \n\nGrandma does not like my fianc\u00e9 because he has a lot of tattoos and piercings and she is a very classic southern woman.

He\u2019s an adult who should know better than to show up places uninvited, and that he did that before doesn\u2019t warrant him getting an invite wouldn\u2019t have otherwise gotten.", "NTA, but maybe you can make room for one more guest (of your choosing) by telling grandma to stay home.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding not grandmas. She doesn\u2019t get a say.\n\nTell her that if she asks one more time, she herself will be uninvited to the wedding. That it is non-negotiable.", "Nta\n\nIt's your wedding. Do what makes you happy. If your Grandmother say she won't come tell that's OK with you.", "Uninvite nosy-@$$ grandma instead...", "\"It isn't just about you!\" to a woman about her wedding day. What? If anybody *ever* gets an occasion that is \"just about them\", it's someone on their wedding day.\n\nNTA. She doesn't get the slightest say in who you invite or don't invite. Tell her if she's that upset about it, she doesn't have to come. It's sure as hell not just about *her*!", "NTA. tell your grandmother to fuck off. maybe in politer terms, maybe not", "Omg NTA but grandma sure is an AH.", "NtA. Your wedding day is very much about you!  Is your grandmother delusional or does she not understand weddings? I would actually uninvite grandma just because", "And childbirth/child rearing as well?   I'd love to know who grandma thinks should be in the delivery room for OPs future children. She probably wants to turn that into a circus as well.\n\nOP, and everyone else, stop asking if you are t-a for people horning in on your events.  YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE - ***NTA!!***", "Right? Per Grandma he could be 8 degrees of separation and still be entitled to an invite", "I bet grandma would like the delivery room to belie that scene in Midsommar, when she\u2019s having a panic attack surrounding by women", "Sleep well champ.", "\"...it isn't just about me [OP]\"\n\nWell, actually, it IS all about you (and your fianc\u00e9), as it is YOUR freaking WEDDING!", "NTA. Since you have \"always been one to do things that she does not approve of\", what's your problem now? Just say \"No\"! \n\nI find it interesting that the complaint came from your grandmother but not from your Uncle and his wife. It seems they are fine with the situation.", "Classic southern old woman\u2026. Thinks everyone has to kneel to her demands and what not. NTA, I feel for you (grew up in the south) and I do hope the wedding goes well. It\u2019s also funny she goes \u201cit\u2019s not about you\u201d except it\u2019s your and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, not sure how that works but ok.", "NTA\n\nWe had a very small wedding (50 people including ourselves and our son). We did our invites based on who it was meaningful to invite. Blood relation didn't guarantee an invite, plus ones were only for relationships that were long term and we knew them well. No kids except ours, and nieces/nephews. \n\nIf the guy isn't important enough to share everyday events with (and I'm assuming not, based on your info), then he's not important enough to share the special ones.\n\nAlso. Yours and your fianc\u00e9's wedding, your guestlist, your decision. Ignore anyone else.\n\nHave a fantastic wedding day, and enjoy the life you build together.", "No you are not.", "NTA.  But if you want to put this back on grandma, figure out how expensive it would be to add a seat and the food truck ticket and offer to do so for however much that would be, if she'd like to pay it.", "You're NTA. Granny doesn't get to dictate your guest list. Besides, what makes her think he even wants to go, and assuming he does, who appointed her his spokesperson?", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d disinvite your grandmother as well. From your account, she doesn\u2019t like your fianc\u00e9, which would\u2019ve been an automatic no invite from me, and now she\u2019s throwing a fit about the guest list for a wedding that she\u2019s not involved in as anything other than a guest.\n\nTell Grandma she can keep your step-cousin company somewhere else during your wedding since she\u2019s so concerned for his well-being.", "Someone told you, the bride, that the wedding wasn\u2019t about you, in reference to someone other than the groom?\n\nNTA", "Your wedding, your day, your decisions rule. Block the naysayers and do what you want.", "NTA, yes, it is all about you.  The stepbrother is a grown a$$ man that has his own home.  You are not leaving a little kid at home.  Tell grandma to get over it or not to show up.", "NTA uninvite grandma too, easy", "NTA\n\nun-invite grandma too. Generally weddings are about the bride and groom. Definitely not about the brides\u2018s cousin\u2019s stepbrother", "NTA. He probably doesn\u2019t even know your name", "NTA OP.  Grandma sounds entitled, and you told her no.", ">that it isn\u2019t just about me\n\nShe's right - it's also about your fiance.\n\nNTA\n\n>Grandma does not like my fianc\u00e9 because he has a lot of tattoos and piercings and she is a very classic southern woman\n\nSo, boys like that are only good enough to f\\*ck but not to marry?", "NTA at all", "It\u2019s not about you??? Since when? NTA", "Nta imagine telling the bride that her wedding isn't about her. I'm laughing too hard at that.", "NTA. And your grandma should keep her mouth closed.", "But it IS about you\u2026it\u2019s literally YOUR (and your fianc\u00e9s) Big Day!!! Whoever doesn\u2019t like it can go kick rocks whether they contributed financially or not. Helping out with the cost of a wedding doesn\u2019t give that person the right to take over or control any part of it either!! Put your foot down and have an amazing wedding! Best of wishes to you both!!", "NTA - he is not related to you. You are inviting your uncle and his wife per etiquette, not his entire family.", "Heck my husbands family cut us off and didn\u2019t come near our wedding because we refused to invite a distant friend of MILs Mum. so Grandmothers distant friend. That MIL hadn\u2019t seen in 30 years and that was at her own wedding, not even sure if the gran had spoken to them in decades. Get this MIL complained non stop that she\u2019d been forced to invite this person to her wedding and hadn\u2019t had Any contact with them since. Then she demanded we invite them and pay for their meal since we said no she went berserk and bullied the rest of his family not to come near it either. \n\nI felt bad for him but he actually was glad and said it let him relax and enjoy the day instead of worrying what she would pull. We also got the plus side of cancelling and changing all the insane demands she had for our wedding as it had been turning into her day not ours, all on our own dime.", "Yeah honestly I\u2019d be kind of weirded out if I was him and got an invite. He would feel obligated to go to a strangers wedding and buy a gift on top of that.", "Probably why she followed up with \"he won't have a seat or food\"", "Your grandma wants you to invite her step-grandson? Am I understanding the connection right? Is she for some reason very close to him? I'm just very unable to follow any kind of logic on this one. NTA, by the way.", "NTA. I\u2019d be petty and tell grandma if she\u2019s so upset he can\u2019t come then she can stay home too.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding. Your choice. Your day. Your say.", "NTA", "NTA. This is your wedding and you get to decide.  Sorry Grandma.", "Nta. Your grandmother is, though. Even if she WERE financially contributing to your wedding, that wouldn't mean she had the right to bully you into inviting a glorified stranger to your wedding. IDK what or whom your granny thinks YOUR wedding is about... your wedding is a celebration of you and your fianc\u00e9 coming together in the creation of a new family.", "NTA - YOUR wedding YOUR guestlist. Don't be pressured into inviting ANYONE you don't want there. It's a day about your fiance and you", "NTA. Tell grandma if she wants him there so bad, she can pay for his seat and food. End of story - it\u2019s your wedding. You said no. He is not technically related to you and you have no relationship with him. You do not need to invite anyone out of obligation.", "I haven't been invited to every wedding my mom has been invited to due to the nature of the relationships. If I were the stepbrother, an invite would look like a gift grab. Why would he WANT to attend? NTA. You don't have to invite a virtual stranger to your wedding just because he's related to your stepmom.", "NTA.  It is about you; its your wedding!!!\n\nNo do not invite him. Grandma, uncle and Santa can get over themselves; they don't get to try to strong arm you into inviting a stranger to your wedding.  You have only met him once, thats it, you don't owe him anything. \n\nStop stressing yourself out, ignore grandma.  \nDon't do it.", "Wait, the grandma said OPs wedding wasn't about her?", "NTA. It's your wedding, you reserve the right, and none of the other details are particularly relevant. Anyone who disapproves of your guest list is free to also not attend.", "So why is grandma invited? Sounds like op could be better suited to give that seat to fianc\u00e9s family. its really disrespectful to her fianc\u00e9 to invite grandma imo, regardless on who\u2019s shelling the bill."]}
