I am very close to my 1st cousin 23F and she is one of my bridesmaids.  9Years ago her dad, my uncle, 50M got remarried to her step mom. My cousin does not like her step mom and I have only had a handful of interactions with the step mom over the past 9 years. I did meet the step brother one time years ago however, I have spoken to him only one other time since when he randomly showed up at my sisters reception uninvited. \n\nSo I decided I would only invite my uncle and his wife to the wedding and not the step son. This came up in conversation with my grandmother 70F and she demanded that I give them another invite for the step brother. She has not contributed any money to my wedding and she has made it very clear she does not like my fianc\u00e9. So I told her I will not be inviting him and if he shows up there will not be a seat or food for him (we are having a food truck and only purchased enough tickets for the people invited). \n\nShe then started to yell at me and told me I was being unreasonable and needed to get over myself and that it isn\u2019t just about me. She then tried to ask my fianc\u00e9 and he also said no. She has now been complaint about me to the rest of the family. So AITA?\n\nEdit: The step brother is 32 and does not live with the uncle and step mother. My cousin does not have a close relationship with him either. The relationship between my uncle and mom is strained because of some bad choices he made years ago that rubbed her and my dad the wrong way but that is not my story. The wedding is very small to start with and there will only be 55 people including myself and fianc\u00e9. There is a lot of other family that is not invited because I have not seen them in 10+ years and would not be comfortable inviting them. \n\nAlso, my fianc\u00e9s parents and my fianc\u00e9 and I are the only ones paying for the wedding. No money is being given from my side of the family \n\nGrandma does not like my fianc\u00e9 because he has a lot of tattoos and piercings and she is a very classic southern woman. My relationship with my grandmother has always been strained since I have always been one to do things that she does not approve of.", "created_utc": 1680350191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128k5ex/aita_for_not_inviting_my_cousins_step_brother_to/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have any obligation to invite distant relatives to your wedding. Even 1st degree cousins who you're not close to don't need to be invited, let alone step-cousins.

Literally every single wedding has some kind of drama and hurt feelings because someone feels left out.

The line has to be drawn somewhere, and choosing to not invite distant family that they don't know is acceptable. \n\nIf the wedding had hundreds of guests and every family member even remotely related to the wedding couple was invited, or if someone else was literally paying for the whole thing, then it might be odd to exclude this one person.  Even in those two scenarios, excluding one person is a valid choice.\n\nGrandma is already upset about the groom. Uncle and grandma can throw their own bitchfest party including this son if they feel that strongly about it.", "She's NTA\n\nWhy would she be losing a bridesmaid?   \n\nIs it a big loss if the uncle's family doesn't come?\n\nWould Grandma's absence be a big loss? \n\nHINT:  The answers are in the post.", "The cousin seems fine with the situation - OP isn't going to lose a bridesmaid.\n\nGrandma is the one kicking up a fuss. While Grandma isn't entirely wrong (who invites 3/4 of a family?) it's also not Grandma's guest list."]}
