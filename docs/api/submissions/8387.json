I apologized to keep the peace but I honestly think it\u2019s ridiculous that after so many years together he refuses to share things like this with me. These aren\u2019t special pots or anything.

Honestly, wtf? I'm baffled by this. You've been together six years, living together over a year, and that's how he reacts? I would keep an eye out for other unreasonable bouts of anger or overreaction, this is a huge red flag to me. \n\nWhat did he want you to do?? You didn't have access to your own pans, so you should spend extra for takeout??", "You're NTA. What were you supposed to do,  drive back to the old apartment and cook there? How is it that can you share living quarters and presumably a bed, but not pots and pans?", "NTA.\n\nI think your boyfriend is being a little bit too possessive over his belongings. You guys are living together, as a couple, which would generally mean you would be sharing most things and most spaces. \n\nIf you were platonic roommates or friends, I could understand having your own set of cookware, but you\u2019re in a relationship with each other, presumably one day to be married. At that point, your things become legally intertwined, so he should probably get over this hurdle of needing to keep things separate.", "NTA if u are both living together kitchen stuff is shared if he reacted that way is a very big red flag. Thinks will get worse honestly. Some people say u don't really know anyone till u live together. Which u the best.", "NTA. So he sometimes uses your dishes because you have more of them (so, because it\u2019s convenient for him), but this one time you were not allowed to use his stuff for the same reason?\n\nHow is the rest of your relationship? It\u2019s not unheard of for immature people to pick stupid little fights with the SOs because they want to break up but are too scared/immature/whatever to say so.", "NTA.   This is ridiculous. Unless he is some chef with very expensive cookware that can be ruined if not used and cleaned properly, this makes no sense.  Is he controlling in other ways?   In any event, you've been together 6 years.  This can't be the first time he's overreacted to something, or the first time you used something of his.  Or do you walk on eggshells all the time.    This doesn't sound like a way I want to live.   \n\nAnd it makes perfect sense your apology wasn't authentic.   However next time don't apologize.  Calmly state that you thought after a year and a half, and living together, you didn't need permission to use a pan from the kitchen.  Maybe ask him for a list of what is his and what is yours, so you know what you can touch and what you can take with you when you leave his ass.", "NTA\nGenerally when you live together with your partner you share your belongings. It\u2019s odd that he isn\u2019t comfortable with you using his pots and pans. You clearly have no issue with sharing or getting new items to get rid of the whole \u201cpersonal items\u201d debacle, has he given a reason as to why he isn\u2019t comfortable?", "NTA. If he acts like this over pots and pans, you need to find another place to live. A roommate might do that, not a boyfriend you live with.", "NTA if he reacts like this to pots then that's a problem", "NTA. They're pots and pans. Some people are very protective over their things but when you're in a committed relationship such as yours, it's completely normal to share normal things like cookware.\n\nThe fact that his reaction to you cooking with his cookware is to 'go off at you' isn't good though. Just speculation here but I feel like having your own cheap sets of cookware instead of one decent set to share when you two are living together feels like maybe he is scared to be fully committed to you - possibly sharing cookware could make it feel too real. That last bit is just speculation though, take it with a grain of salt but I do think there are some underlying issues here.", "NTA but it sounds like he's not really committed to this or mature enough to have you living with him. Not wanting to share personal things is one thing but unless it's professional grade cookware this should be a non issue. Honestly him not wanting to share basic living things like pots and pans or plates in any way is a huge huge red flag.", "What exactly did your boyfriend expect you to cook on? \n\nThis response is wildly disproportionate and honestly a huge red flag to me. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThis is extremely weird and frankly pretty inappropriate at this stage in your relationship. You need to sit him down and have a serious talk about the future and how you function as a partnership, because as it is he's treating you like a roommate he dislikes.\n\nMy boyfriend and I moved in together after a year and immediately put all our duplicate stuff in a box in the garage. The fact that we kept dupes at all is weird to some people, because it's admitting that we might not stay together longterm. What you're describing sounds like he's not sure you'll still be together *tomorrow,* or he has a pretty significant mental health issue going on that's causing him to be irrationally possessive.", "NTA. Don't share space with someone who shares *only* the space. Have there been other weird anti-sharing/controlling things like this?", "NTA\n\nYou're living together and those are the only pots in the house?  And his reaction is ridiculous unless his pots are kosher and you're cooking treif in them (and even then, that's over the top)", "NTA\nHe's being weird. Y'all have been living together for closer to 2 years.", "NTA. This is honestly weird after so long together. Is this a weird quirk, or is he this way with all personal possessions?", "NTA  but your BF definitely is.  \n\n\nYou need to sit down and have a conversation about what living together is.  He is treating you like a room mate and not a partner.", "NTA leave him now before you end up married to him", "NTA. My roommates and I share all cooking materials, it\u2019s a weird boundary to not share cooking materials with someone you\u2019ve been in a relationship with for 6 years.", ">The thing is, it wasnt. I apologized to keep the peace but I honestly think it\u2019s ridiculous that after so many years together he refuses to share things like this with me.\n\nNTA but why are you with this person? You share a life together and now a home. Cookware is something I think most couples share. I can see not wanting to share headphones cuz that feels inherently personal. But a pan or a pot should be community property (or shared freely).", "NTA what does he think living together means? Boy has his head in the clouds about what a functional relationship looks like if you're living together.", "You're a couple...not roommates! You pick the best set of pans and use those, get rid of the rest! If he is freaking out over you using a pan (properly I might add plus washing it when done!) then he doesn't see you as equal and you might as well find yourself a new place before you're both completely moved in. You're NTA He is!", "Do you have separate sheets too?\n\nNTA", "Toxic", "NTA \n\nhonestly though, how can you ignore those red flags.  You have a separate less quality set, and he has a fancy set that you can\u2019t use? Really? \n\nSounds like he\u2019s worried you\u2019ll dump him.  Maybe you should.  At least half your stuff is already out because he didn\u2019t help you move it.", "NTA and girl...this is weird AF. Big red flags. This is not normal behavior for a couple (his, not yours.)", "NTA: Tentatively, but I am confused a bit. Does he have a mental illness or condition, I only ask because you tried to get a better set of pots/pans together and he refused then in your edit added he's like this with other things as well. Honestly this screams there is INFO we needed to know left out OR info you need that he hasn't told you about because that reaction is way overboard for those circumstances unless he is secretly looking for a way to get out of this relationship for some reason.", "YTA to yourself for not leaving his ass", "NTA. As a man who's lived with his highschool sweetheart for almost 10 years now, i would tell you that he isnt mature enough to he living with his partner. When you live with someone you share everything with them. my girlfriend and i both share all of our belongings, we wear eachothers clothes, use eachothers phones, hair brushes, etc. If theres something we dont want the other to use we make it clear to the other person. You need to have a serious talk with him about what it means to be a couple and to live together.", " NTA. He\u2019ll share his life but not his pans? This\u2026is very weird. Like, he wanted you to just not eat?\n\nThis is super weird.", "NTA, girl, you can do better. After 6 years, it should be \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is yours and vise versa\u201d. The fact that you have two sets of pots and pans and plates is INSANE. Even regular roommates generally share that sort of thing, let alone the love of your life.\n\nSeriously, picture this as your future, is this what you want? I just really really think you can do better, but more importantly you DESERVE better.", "INFO: why would you put up with this for 6 years? Wasting 6 years of your life on a man who won\u2019t even let you borrow his pillow. Jesus.", "NTA\u2026but also this is a huge issue. He seems very immature, especially given the fact that you have been dating and living together for so long. I\u2019m not suggesting that you start sharing a tooth brush, but he needs to come to terms with the fact that you will have to start sharing most household items, and having 2 sets of pans and who knows what else is very unusual and not very practical.", "NTA\n\nI could see this with a roommate but not with a romantic partner. I think if the issue was allergies you wouldn't be confused. The pillow thing might be slightly different if he just has a favor pillow.\n\nIt's been 6 years and you guys have lived together for over a year. Will he continue things like this after you guys get married? A lot of stuff is just going to be owned by both of you.", "NTA. I probably would have done the same, given the circumstances. \n\nYou're living together, and a couple, and you can't use his stuff? Are you careless with them? Do you take really good care with and of them? \n\nI mean, I don't know how you ruin a pan making pasta, but I suppose it's possible. \n\nI don't like his reaction, either, though you did violate a boundary. Without knowing why he has these boundaries, I'm going to say ESH.", "I\u2019m gonna go NTA, however you knew his boundary about his pots and pans. That said his reaction is troubling and dysfunctional. If he tends to respond like that to disagreements, there needs to be further discussions on healthy communication.", "YTA, you\u2019re correct that you\u2019re not in the right. \nDon\u2019t use people\u2019s things without permission first, you\u2019ve been together long enough that you should know this part of his personality. \n\nHe paid for them and they\u2019re HIS, so you need to respect that, and respect his boundaries when it comes to belongings. If you\u2019re not able to, then maybe it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t get married.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should take a moment or 100 to reflect on this and other behaviors he probably has and ask yourself, how will you feel 10 or 20 years from now?

Him expecting you to be inconvenienced by driving back to your old apartment to retrieve your cookware just so you can eat is unreasonable...and strange.  It's expected that when you move in with your significant other, everything in common areas become shared because you're sharing your lives together.  (Even roommates tend to share!).

Let me tell you that there is nothing normal about his responses with you and his attachment to his belongings.\n\nYou're okay now, but throw a child into the mix and how do you think it's going to go.  It won't be pretty.  The child will not be able to touch anything of his and his anger will then be directed towards the child (or you for not keeping the child away from his things).  You will probably be paying for everything to do with the child and him nothing.\n\nIt's okay to have separate finances (works best if you both earn a similar amount) and both contribute to bills etc.  But things will change in the future.  Your partner has a history and his behaviours may have been developed from what he saw at home.\n\nSo you need to really work out whether this is the sort of life you want for yourself.\n\nThe anger is a real red flag and can turn dangerous.  I would suggest you don't consider marriage until you have worked through some significant issues and that likely needs the help of a trained professional.  What worries me is that you don't know what normal is if you've had a rough upbringing.  If you have had a happy upbringing, what did you see at home?  Did your dad separate all his things and not let your mom touch them?  Did he yell and scream a lot when things didn't go his way.  That's not normal either so you possibly don't know what you don't know.
