My (32F) ex-husband (49M) and I get along well for the most part. We co-parent our 9 year old daughter on a mostly 50/50 basis with me having her for a few extra days a month due to his fly-in/fly-out schedule for work.\n\nThe only areas we butt heads with are his lack of communication and nutrition when it comes to our daughter. (The nutrition thing is a pain to deal with but ultimately not the issue at hand here). Since we've been divorced, about 5 years now, he has consistently forgotten to communicate when he needs me to take her early for him, or on days when it would typically be his week with her. I've raised my concerns with him each time and asked him to give me more than a day or two notice when he needs me to take her, but he has failed to do so each time. Because I obviously want my daughter with me as much as possible, I always take her anyway and reschedule any plans I may have made for myself that conflict.\n\nRecently, he and I were talking on the phone and he says to me, 'you know you're taking her for 3 weeks as of tomorrow right?'\nI did not. He mentioned that he was thinking about taking holidays in September way back in April, did not say when in September and never brought it up again. \n\nI had appointments booked for my week without her and an overnight trip planned. Out of frustration with him and his pattern of disrespect for me and my time, I refused to take her. My thoughts being, if I keep doing this for him he will continue to forget and things will never change. I am a very passive person and he knows this. I decided to stand up for myself and not accept his walking all over me.\n\nHe got extremely upset with me, and has demanded that he can not count on me for anything, and that he will no longer help me out when I need him to take her. Keep in mind, he has never taken her for me on his days off or helped out in that way whatsoever for me, so this really doesn't effect me in any way at all.\nHe claims he cancelled his vacation and wasted $1000 on it now because he has no childcare for his week with her.\n\nI understand his frustration with cancelling his vacation. He on the other hand does not understand my frustrations with his lack of communication and has been cold with me since.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694899321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kifxi/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_daughter_during_my/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve put up with far too much of this bullshit already. From now on, set a strict boundary on how much notice he has to give you and do not bend on it. He\u2019s disrespecting you regularly and frankly it seems like a power play. Stop letting him get away with it.", "NTA and I'm so happy you finally stood up for yourself!!!!!", "NTA. Evhas to plan better and communicate.

What an ass. \n\nSo this: *\"..if I keep doing this for him he will continue to forget and things will never change*.\n\nHe wasted vacation money because he failed to plan, proactively ask and secure your daughter to be with you when he is scheduled to parent.  Relax and indulge in 'me' time.", "NTA. But everything needs to be in writing.

My dad used to do the same thing even though he was only an every second weekend dad. It would get close to school break and mum would call him to see what extra days he would take. Most of the time he'd say something about actually taking us less because he was going on holiday. Then he'd get back and tell us about how much fun he had with his wife's family and their kids on their kid oriented holiday.\n\nYour ex is a father. He has a commitment to his daughter. That commitment doesn't go away because he wants a holiday. It's unfair to you that he drops these things last minute, but it's even more unfair to your daughter. Watch your daughter for signs that her father is blaming her for not getting what he wants.", "Nta", "NTA Stand your ground. He's going to keep throwing a tantrum like this.

You don't even have to consider last-minute demands, because you don't owe him anything.\n\nA 3-week vacation as of tomorrow?  Wildly disrespectful.  Like, sewer rats get more respect than that.  Rabid sewer rats.  With bad breath.\n\nIt doesn't matter how frustrated he is; he fucked around and found out.", "NTA good for you!!!

Does this man not know how to use a calendar?  Does he not have his time with his daughter blocked out?  His inability to use a calendar does not constitute an emergency on your part.  And his failure to communicate does not mean that you\u2019re the one who has to lose money.", "NTA, you've been so accommodating that he takes advantage of you. His reaction to your one and only refusal puts him squarely in the asshole zone.", "Honestly, most people need at least a month's heads up if not more to rearrange a schedule for an entire week. When a vacation is potentially being booked, the scheduling changes should be approved before hitting go.\n\nI would be more lenient with business travel extending a day or two here or there, as a rule (but it's also OK to ask for a heads up as early as possible, as you may have plans - I mean, I have doctors' appointments I make a year in advance, and rescheduling can take a month or two.)\n\nI am surprised you've made it 5 years without standing firm that, \"No, your week is your week and I've made plans.\"\n\nNTA", "Sucks to be him I guess.  My X pulls this shit too.  Your household does not revolve around his plans.  His lack of planning or communication is his problem to solve,  not yours.

I've been here myself.", "NTA. Make sure you have all written communications in case you ever need them in court. \n\nIt's a courtesy to ask the other parent to babysit first, it isn't a requirement for them to accept. You aren't just a drop off childcare whenever he has other plans.", "NTA. There is nothing further I can add because the men and women of reddit totally rock and covered any advice, and encouragement I had. So just keep your chin up.", "NTa", "NTA. He will now plan ahead better if he really wants a vacation. This is really all you could to to get him to work with you better.", "NTA\n\nHe's just being cold with you to manipumate you into giving in the next time he's pulling that stunt again.\n\nShow him your shiny spine.\n\nNTA", "Ex: I can't count on you for anything.

I think you should gladly take your daughter but have a serious discussion with your ex husband about boundaries moving forward.", "OP is 32. The age gap has nothing to do with her post. None of reddit's business", "ESH I hate parents like you who\u201dlove\u201d their kids and want them with then but play hot potato with the kid, you think your kid does not know, well guess again because I will bet that she is totally aware dad and you are fighting about who takes her next week. Both of you need to do better", "NTA but remember the shoe may be on the other foot someday.\n\nAlso know that the age gap with your husband will trigger the age gap brigade and they will harp on that instead of addressing your actual question.
