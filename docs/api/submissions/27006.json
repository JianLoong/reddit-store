My (32F) ex-husband (49M) and I get along well for the most part. We co-parent our 9 year old daughter on a mostly 50/50 basis with me having her for a few extra days a month due to his fly-in/fly-out schedule for work.\n\nThe only areas we butt heads with are his lack of communication and nutrition when it comes to our daughter. (The nutrition thing is a pain to deal with but ultimately not the issue at hand here). Since we've been divorced, about 5 years now, he has consistently forgotten to communicate when he needs me to take her early for him, or on days when it would typically be his week with her. I've raised my concerns with him each time and asked him to give me more than a day or two notice when he needs me to take her, but he has failed to do so each time. Because I obviously want my daughter with me as much as possible, I always take her anyway and reschedule any plans I may have made for myself that conflict.\n\nRecently, he and I were talking on the phone and he says to me, 'you know you're taking her for 3 weeks as of tomorrow right?'\nI did not. He mentioned that he was thinking about taking holidays in September way back in April, did not say when in September and never brought it up again. \n\nI had appointments booked for my week without her and an overnight trip planned. Out of frustration with him and his pattern of disrespect for me and my time, I refused to take her. My thoughts being, if I keep doing this for him he will continue to forget and things will never change. I am a very passive person and he knows this. I decided to stand up for myself and not accept his walking all over me.\n\nHe got extremely upset with me, and has demanded that he can not count on me for anything, and that he will no longer help me out when I need him to take her. Keep in mind, he has never taken her for me on his days off or helped out in that way whatsoever for me, so this really doesn't effect me in any way at all.\nHe claims he cancelled his vacation and wasted $1000 on it now because he has no childcare for his week with her.\n\nI understand his frustration with cancelling his vacation. He on the other hand does not understand my frustrations with his lack of communication and has been cold with me since.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694899321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kifxi/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_daughter_during_my/", "score": 1328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then he'd get back and tell us about how much fun he had with his wife's family and their kids on their kid oriented holiday.\n\nYour ex is a father. He has a commitment to his daughter.

He did not make sure that appropriate care was arranged, so he doesn\u2019t get to to go on a childfree vacation. His lack of communication and planning skills are not your problem. After he has had your daughter, make sure you watch out for any signs that he badmouths you to her (parental alienation) or makes her feel like his missed vacation is her fault, though. That would necessitate some intervention from a judge to make sure he is behaving appropriately.", "NTA\n\nMaybe now he'll stop taking advantage of your good nature and hopefully (if he has any sense) the next time he plans something will consult you first. Keep standing your ground, OP", "Cold with you? So what? This is what happens when people who get their own way suddenly don't.\n\nPeople like him are happy to disregard your time and disrespect you and are unhappy when you don't allow it.\n\nSet your daughter a good example in life by not letting him walk all over you.\n\nNTA", "NTA- and WHY couldn't he plan a VACATION WITH his daughter??", "NTA. You and he need to download a parenting app (I highly recommend AppClose because it is free and I think it functions as well or better than the paid versions such as Talking Parents or Our Family Wizard). You use it for all text communication (it is in your best interest to text only on the app and not directly on the phone) and it you both will have a record of your texts that cannot be altered (good for court if needed): it shows the time the texts was sent the time the text was seen by the other parent and the time it was responded to. It also has a shared calendar where you both can add dates of travel and custody changes, doctors appointments, school functions, teacher meetings, sports practices and games. There is also a Venmo type function that allows you to transfer up to $500 per month for reimbursements and it documents when the money was sent and received.\n\nSo, not only should that hopefully help you with those mix ups, in the case it doesn\u2019t, you will have easy to introduce evidence for court if you have to file contempt against him.", "NTA. Contact your lawyer. Make notes. Make the custody agreement fair for you.", "He can still go on holiday but with his child. Is that not an option, most people don\u2019t ditch their offspring to go on holiday? At least not generally, there are exceptions but why would this not be acceptable unless he\u2019s planning to extreme sport or whatever.", "Let him be cold with you. It's not like you're married to him.\n\nHonestly, you should be having no contact with him aside from discussing your daughter.\n\nIt's long past time that you stopped letting him walk all over you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is my ex. Only twice in 10 years did he ever take extra time to help me out. Once was a day early so I could go away for a weekend, the other was a minor op where there was a chance I would be admitted overnight. He made me beg for that one and constantly used this \"favour\" against me.\n\nWell done for standing your ground and good luck. I suspect it won't actually get easier. Keep EVERYTHING documented and tracked. Make sure you have track changes on the Google doc.", "Nope NTA. You did the right thing! Congratulations! He was testing you and he shouldn't make the same mistake again.", "I guess it depends on if you would have agreed to do it had you been given more solid notice.", "I made a shared Google calendar and X still acts much like OP\u2019s. And I act like OP because I want my Son to be with me.", "This is what I thought too. He is used to telling her how high to jump and when to jump.", "This is what I saw. \n\nBet she grew into herself and divorced him. \n\nHe wants a nanny and maid and mummy!\n\nShe needs a written childcare agreement and \u201chas plans\u201d when he has the kid", "If we do the math she had to been like what 22-23 pregnant and depending how long they were together or knew each other before then\u2026..", "I wish people would stop commenting on their age gap.

So maybe the question is, why is he choosing to go on holiday and be away from his child? OP says she takes the kid whenever ex asks \"because obviously I want to spend as much time with my kid as possible\". Like OP if I already only got to spend alternate weeks with my child, I would hold onto those weeks as tight as I could, there is no way I would ever give those weeks up unless it was an emergency.", "Not exactly a 3 week vacation. Tomorrow is her regular week, it\u2019s his week of work flying out, his proposed week of vacation when he would have have the daughter, his week of work flying out.  That\u2019s how she would have had three weeks in a row,  two of those weeks were her weeks to have the daughter.", "T H I S!", "I'm very aware of the damage it could do to her if she gets wind of us arguing.

Thank goodness.", "How is this a kinda???\n\nThe dad was ment to have the child for 3 weeks, BUT he wanted the mom to take their child back a week early so he could go on a vacation\u2026\u2026 a vacation he could of scheduled for a week when he didn\u2019t have his child.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to hear the fuckary that comes out of your mouth.\n\nBecause she was within every right to say no.", "Better yet, speak to your custody lawyer, some courts dobt accept Google documents but there are co-parenting apps out there that they do accept, and they are easy to use. Better safe than sorry because if he is doing this regularly than you should be getting more child support anyway. \n\nDo everything legally and get a co-parenting app.", "Use a coparenting app so there is a record instead. You may want evidence later.\n\nETA Good on you for taking a stand. As you said, his threats are empty so you have all the power here.", "No you need to get that court app. Do all your communication through it and then if something happens they can pull the records and use it to settle disputes in court", "They have Co parenting apps for this reason, courts use them all the time.", "Co-parenting apps are the best.  A Google doc just won\u2019t cut it.", "There are co-parenting apps for this", "I believe there is an app you can use recognizes in court? You should use that so you automatically have documentation valid legally just in case. NTA", "Yeah, I agree with the coparenting apps. It\u2019s not as amicable as you think it is, and his negligence is not carelessness but I think it\u2019s calculated as a means of control. He get to say when you have freedom and he gets to have it when he wants because he knows you\u2019ll accept it. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve taken the first step, and now he hopefully turns out to be decent as a parent if not a partner and doesn\u2019t take it out on her.", "No. Do it over email or text so he can't revise.", "Isn't there an appt for ex spouses to communicate plans on. & keep a written record of what's going on.", "He emails you his needs and you alone update Google doc.

While his reaction is not your fault at all, from your post it\u2019s clear you know it\u2019s best for your daughter if you two get along. Maybe you just need a mediator for a conversation or two about communication to get on the same page. Sometimes what people need to cop on is a neutral 3rd party telling them they\u2019re being unreasonable.

He\u2019s gotten caught lying about shit through that app.", "Our Family Wizard was court order for my son's father and I and I'm so glad it was.  Everything was time stamped and in one place.  Your lawyers can also get on it if you give them permission and the court can see it.  The child(ren) gets a free account.  It's worth the expense.", "Sorry, but I am reading this string of posts and can\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t want to fucking be a parent for their kids?

It\u2019s the ex who needs to step up his side of organization.\n\nOp could stick up for herself, which she has begun to do. He chose a young girl who was easy to mould to his liking.

That's why men like him go after very young women. It's not her fault for still being naive at 20 and not seeing the red flags, and we should just be happy that she got out.", "I'm sorry but Op thinks they have a good co-parenting relationship. It's only good as long as he gets his way. Op needs to continue to reevaluate their relationship. Her ex is a predator. It sounds like he basically does whatever he wants and dismisses her when he doesn't agree.", "Is she? She's still questioning her pushing back on him when he's the one who is still trying to control her by dumping their daughter on her whenever he wants.  No one seems to mention this... his dumping their daughter into her whenever he wants means he controls her social life and vacation plan. He's getting off on being able to keep controlling her.  She means to grow up faster and recognize his bs.", "okay, I was horrified by your line of questioning until I got to this and I agree.
