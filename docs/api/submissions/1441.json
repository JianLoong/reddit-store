Did I react accordingly?\n\nNow, before I continue, let me preface/justify this by saying I don't mind being inquisitive or uneducated about how disabled people live their lives. I absolutely LOVE (therefore actively encourage) questions, it makes me feel good that people actually want to know things, so I can maybe demystify disabilities and make socialising easier. However, in my opinion there's a right and wrong way to go about it.\n\nOnto the story. My (19F) friend (lets call him Steve, 21M) messaged me tonight and asked a bit of an odd question, in an even more odd way; \"Since you're like broken, ig you can't fuck like normal people?\" For context, I came out of an almost 3-year relationship this year, and we'd been discussing moving on/new relationships. I'm not one for casual hookups cause I find them boring, so I'd want a committed relationship. I hadn't mentioned my disability during this conversation,it had no relevance.

Thats a perfectly fine way to say it in my opinion, and I'm open to answering that. But instead, I hear from my friend that he not only thinks I'm not normal, but am broken too. So I told him \"I don't appreciate being disrespected in this way. I am normal, and I am certainly not broken. Learn to have some fucking respect for disabled people before speaking to me again.\" And muted him. He's spamming me saying I overreacted, and a mutual friend of ours agrees that I did, and has justified it by saying \"he's been so busy at work\".

Not all people realize that that is a bad way to phrase it, and they can learn.  But the tone overall that he used is gross and shows his mindset.  He is thinking about you in terms of fuckability, not trying to learn if certain disabilities can prevent someone from having sex.

There\u2019s also broader issues with a lack of representation of sexual disabled people in media. Being asexual is totally valid but being disabled does not automatically mean you are ace.", "NTA\nThat guy is terrible and your other so caked friend isn't one. I'm sorry this gradients to you. You deserve better friends. You deserve real friends. \nTell both of them they can apologize or f off", "NTA at all, that guy deserved worse", "Nta", "NTA\n\nHe is boorish and lacks normal social skills. I would imagine he puts his foot in his mouth about many things and then wonders why people avoid him.\n\nEven before there was any kind of awareness around the issue, no kind person would ever ask something like that out of the blue or phrase it in the manner even if the actual subject came up in a natural manner. It is the kind of thing that parents teach their children about in terms of polite ways to interact with people.\n\nWith you it was your specific disability but I can imagine he has the same kind of rude \\*questions\\* for other things like weight or even facial features.", "Me neither. I did ask them to elaborate on why it justifies his words, and all they said was \"just apologise\".\nI'm not sure where to go from here as this mutual friend is normally quite disability aware, and wouldn't normally call me sensitive.", "Definitely! We're always either sad or wholesome characters, rarely anything sexual/flirty. That needs changing.\n\nI've had similar things happen before and I know people are inquisitive but why do they think its okay to ask such invasive questions? They don't do it to able-bodied people, so why do it to us? I've even had strangers ask questions about \"how it works\". I'm not ace, nor have I ever portrayed myself to be, I've even posted/joked about sexual things before that he's seen/heard, so god knows why he thought that was justified and okay to say?", "Do not apologize, he doesn't deserve your apology! He should be the one apologizing! Just because he's busy at work doesn't mean he can say shit like that.", "I think representation is gradually improving but there\u2019s a long way to go. There are some great content creators talking about this but often it\u2019s mostly disabled people seeking out these discussions. I appreciate you being willing to answer people\u2019s polite and genuine questions though. I try to do the same as long as I\u2019m comfortable. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting being bi and disabled. The way I\u2019m perceived is kind of a dichotomy. When people find out I\u2019m bi they often sexualise me and assume I\u2019ll have a threesome with them and their partner. When people find out I\u2019m disabled they assume I\u2019m asexual. It\u2019s odd.", "I had a surgery as a kid that actually does mean that there are certain sexual activities that many people find normal, but that I can\u2019t do.  There are ways people can ask that don\u2019t reduce a person to a toy, and for people who have libidos and wouldn\u2019t be willing to live celibate lives, knowing that this condition and that wouldn\u2019t take sex off the table could remove a barrier to a relationship.  \n\nWhen it comes to people with typical bodies, it\u2019s pretty well understood that they can do things I can\u2019t.  That\u2019s why whether or not typical-bodied people can do typical things isn\u2019t questioned.\n\nAlso, you may not realize this, but your insinuation that ace people can\u2019t pst or hoke about sexual things can be offensive.  Some of the people I know with the best senses of sexual humor are ace people.  So just posting those jokes doesn\u2019t mean you like sex.  It means nothing more than you like to joke about things."]}
