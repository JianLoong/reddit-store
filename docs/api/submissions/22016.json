Both dogs are pit bulls (not allowed in my apartments) and weigh over 50 pounds (apartment weight limit for dogs is 30).  These dogs are left unattended in her apartment from 7am-7pm monday through friday where they bark and howl constantly and aggressively attack the window and growl whenever anyone walks by.  When she finally comes home to tend to her dogs, she does not clean their messes outside and lets them dig around in our small courtyard, making the whole area look trashy.  \n\nAnyway, I heard lots of aggressive sounding barking outside today around 7:30pm and looked outside to see what was happening.  I saw my new neighbor smoking at the edge of the parking lot and watching her dog bark at a squirrel or bird or something in the tree beside our parking lot.  This wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, BUT the dog was reared up on the passenger door of my CAR that was parked under the tree, jumping around and barking and likely going to scratch and damage my paint.  I couldn\u2019t believe she was just watching her dog act this way and not correcting it.  I grabbed my keys and unlocked and locked my car, causing it to honk two times to get the owner\u2019s attention and let her know I was seeing this, please get your dog off my car.  I waited another minute and watched as the owner continued to not care about how her dog was acting, and then hit the panic alarm on my car.  This scared the dog and the owner both, and the dog jumped away from my car quickly.  \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t see was that she didn\u2019t have the dog on a leash, and it took off running into the wooded area behind the apartments.  The owner chased after it, but came knocking on my door an hour later saying her dog was missing and that it was my fault.  I think she should have had the dog on a leash and shouldn\u2019t have let it jump all over my car, especially after i gave her a warning honk.

She's probably breaking local laws by not having them on a leash.\n\nIt's her fault they ran off, by not having them on a leash.\n\nI'm a dog owner, I have 2 now, and have had several in the past (I am old).  She is a crap dog owner.", "NTA. It's her fault for not having the dog on a leash. Owners like this are a reason many people hate dogs. \n\nReport her to the landlord/building manager or whatnot for violating the lease. As well as telling that the dogs are destroying the yard, other people's property and are off-leash outside.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to sacrifice your cars paint to enable a shitty dog and owner. This is so cliche pit bull owner behavior. I have never met one of those dogs that was even remotely well behaved.", "NTA her dog should have been on a leash. She should not be allowing it to jump on cars. Why haven\u2019t you reported her for not complying with apartment regulations?", "She sounds like someone who shouldn't be a dog owner.  I would never dream of letting my dog do that to someone's car.  NTA really,  for doing that.  You just wanted them away from your vehicle. You even gave a warning honk.   It's her fault the dog was able to run away though.  It should have been on a leash.", "Those poor dogs sound miserable. I would run away too.", "NTA", "NTA. If her dog isn't well-trained enough to obey cues like \"halt\" \"stay\" \"come back\" while off-leash, it has no business being off-lead in an unfenced shared area. And she definitely should have called the dog when it first started messing with your car and redirected it. Usinh noise as a deterrent for undesirable behavior that affects YOU and is being ignored by the handler is pretty mild.\n\nBefore people come for me about \"YoU cAn'T tRaIn A dOg OfFlEaSh WiThOuT lEtTiNg It OfF lEaSh\", there are a lot of intermediate steps with varying levels of control (leash, long line, fence, e-collar, etc) and various levels of potential distraction before you jump to \"let them roam around a shared unfenced area with a ton of variables out of my control while totally ignoring them and just vaguely hope for the best\"", "NTA\n\nI have a rescue pitbull. \n\nMy boy is never allowed outside without being on a leash. He's also visibly muzzled.\n\nAll dogs can be unpredictable, so owners need to know if their dog will respond to commands.", "NTA. Shitbulls are the worst. She should have had it on a lead.", "YTA. Your problem is with your neighbor. There are no bad dogs, only owners. It\u2019s fucked up to scare a dog because of the possibility of a minor scratch on your car. You\u2019ll get them in any parking lot you park in.", "Yta why would you even do that? I bet the dogs weren\u2019t even that close to your car and you still decided because you\u2019re like this and want problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
