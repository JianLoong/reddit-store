No 35 year old should be saying mean shit to a teen, props to you for standing up for yourself with some amazing comebacks.

Lol. He's been bald 10+ years now. My brother did the same. Be proud you stood up for yourself against a bully. You're still young, there's every indication that your body will still change.

Fair is fair. \n\nAnd more importantly about the girlfriend, that's not your fault. \n\nIn 34, so I can promise you it wasn't about you (at least not how you think).\n\nShe broke up with him because she realized he the kind of immatute, antagonistic asshole who takes pleasure in picking on teenagers, kids half his age, about stuff that might be a sensitive topic. She realized he's the kind of misogynistic jerk who judges women based solely on appearance and thinks it's totally okay to comment, unprompted, on a woman's/girl's body. She realized he's the kind of cruel, nasty person who will say stuff with the intent of humiliating a family member in front a whole group of people.\n\nIn short, seeing the way he treated you made her see another side of him, the nasty, misogynistic bully side of him. And being a grown ass woman who's probably dated other dudes before, she's smart enough to have seen his behavior for the giant red flag it is, and she wisely noped out of that relationship before she became the target of crap like this.\n\nSo no, NTA.\n\nBut you know who is?

Melody didn't break up with him because he has bald patches on his head, but because he showed Melody with his inappropriate attack on you that he is a guy with a very bad character trait. I would have broken up with him too after his terrible performance (he even dared to cuss at you!). Your family not standing by you is a red flag.", "NTA.

The guy was trying to look cool in front of his girlfriend and, even though he knew they were intrusive thoughts, he reverted to type and insulted you and, more importantly, your body.
