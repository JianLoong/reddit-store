NONE of this would've happened it's almost as if you treated everybody nicely this very thing could've been avoided !", "NTA. Honestly she probably broke up with him because it\u2019s icky to watch a 35 year old \u201cadult\u201d pick on a teenager. Plain and simple.", "NTA . She dumped him for his behaviour. Undoubtedly horrified that he would ever make a comment on a young person's still developing body. It's a pretty huge red flag.", "NTA, this is amazing lol. No 35 year old should be saying mean shit to a teen, props to you for standing up for yourself with some amazing comebacks. I can pretty much guarantee you the reason gf broke up with him is NOT bc of his baldness, it's because he's a fully grown adult bullying a kid. Lack of kindness is one of the most unattractive qualities possible, especially when it's towards someone much younger than you. You're cousins an asshole and got what he deserved.", "NTA\n\nHe FAFO. He should have behaved better. He did this to himself. Anyone blaming you is wrong.", "NTA, you saved Melody fr, she deserves better lmao. your bald-ass cousin can go f himself haha", "NTA. And I bet Melody didn\u2019t dump Jared because of his bald spots but because she saw how he bullied a teenager literally half his age.", "NTA. He couldn't take what he dish. lmao, 35 years and still so reactive. Maybe that's what the GF saw and it wasn't the first time.", "Honestly she might have even dumped him because imo there is nothing more unattractive than a grown man bullying a teenager.", "Great story, don't particularly believe it but, let's say this discussion happened, ESH.", "NTA, not your fault he can dish it out, but can\u2019t take it.", "NTA, a snappy comeback to a mean comment does not an AH make. His girlfriend probably broke up with him for publicly bullying a teenage girl.", "NTA. Dollars to donuts that she broke up with him because he\u2019s bullying his own family and not because of what you said. Being an AH to a family member for no reason other than to embarrass them is not a good look.", "NTA. Most likely his own fault she dumped him for being an asshole to you.", "NTA.\n\nUNLESS, coming back with an epic comeback against him to start cussing for no reason /s", "Eh, I don't believe it.", "ESH. For fighting fire with fire", "You are definitely an asshole for that. Your too old to not realize when you should show respect. It's cool to joke around and make fun of each other but have some awareness.", "ESH if this story is even true\n\nJust bad people all being horrible to eachother", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not the reason she broke up with him, it was his comment.", "I\u2019m pretty sure he got dumped for making fun of u for no reason and his reaction by cursing at you when you responded back", "NTA - he\u2019s 35, you\u2019re 17. That says everything. She would have broken up with him anyway.", "When I read the headliner, it was an instant YTA. But after reading the story, NTA. Best clap back ever. Good job.", "Well, you ARE starting to look anorexic.", "NTA, his GF probably dumped him not because of the bald spots, but because your cousin was mortifyingly embarrassing. Body-shaming a teenager for no reason and when said teenager fired back with the easiest possible insult? He got angry and cussing and couldn't take it at all. And he is 35. So embarrassing. I'd leave this clown too.", "NTA, he showed his true colours to her! \n\nI was thinking as I read that you might have done it unprovoked. But nope he had to say something about your body! \n\nIdeally I would suggest calling him out for being inappropriate with you, a literal child! By making comments about your body. But I understand why that wasn\u2019t your go to response.", "If she dumped him she had her reasons. Don't give yourself too much credit. NTA", "NTA, mainly because this didn't even fucking happen", "NTA. I bet that if it was good natured and he laughed and complimented you on your comeback then they'd still be together. Instead his girlfriend saw a small minder man who bullies his younger cousin without being able to take replies without getting angry.", "NTA. She dumped him because of the insanely rude comment he made to you, not because of the hair.", "Nta. He's a grown man picking on a 17 yo girl. That's probably why she dumped him. It had nothing to do with his lack of hair. I have a friend who started shaving his head in his early 20s because he was thinning and his hair dresser asked him if he would be interested in a comb over. \ud83e\udd23 I'm a hairdresser so he asked me about it and I told him it's the beginning of the end. Lol. He's been bald 10+ years now. My brother did the same. Be proud you stood up for yourself against a bully. You're still young, there's every indication that your body will still change. I was tiny and finally filled out during my last year of college. Unfortunately for him, it seems at 35 he's peaked as a jerk. His girlfriend noticed and dumped him.", "Yeah, she saw what an immature prick he was and bailed", "Regardless it still a real douchy thing to do whether or not that was the reason she broke up with him.", "And how is OP AH?", "Why would it be fake? Im confused", "Well, sometimes eye for an eye is the only way to get someone to stop. Based off only assumptions seems like OP doesnt like the cousin BECAUSE he ALWAYS makes remarks (i make the assumption that OP hasnt fought back before) and OP never makes those mean remarks back at him. Now OP has done that and the family only blames OP. so IMO.. NTA, good to stand up for yourself sometimes", "Eh, it reads like a teenagers idea of what being the main character looks like.\nThey have someone insult them out of nowhere and they have this amazing \u201cwitty\u201d come back that puts them over the top and out plays the other person (to the point where their GF breaks up with them - the equivalent of \u201cand then everybody clapped\u201d). \n\nIt sounds like a power fantasy.", "Do you really think this stopped it?\n\nNext time it'll probably be worse.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with you about standing up for yourself. But I don't think in this situation anything will change.", "Thanks!", "Is that really such an amazing comeback that it must be fake?"]}
