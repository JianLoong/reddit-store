Often he would choose my MIL because he wants his kids to spend as much as time her as possible.\n\nThat left my husband and I out of family gatherings. This weekend is his birthday and he wanted to eat out with the rest of the family so he decided to reach out to his mom to clear the air.\n\nHe invited her to birthday lunch with my brother-in-law\u2019s family as well. She said she\u2019ll go under one condition - he has to attend a seminar and sign up as her downline for her MLM company. \n\nWanting to keep the peace he agreed under the agreement that I will not be involved. I didn\u2019t want any part in the MLM company. MIL reassured that it\u2019s no problem that I don\u2019t want to join as long as my husband joins. \n\n\nToday was the seminar. My husband went to the MLM office with my MIL. She also gave him a birthday present. 80 bottles of juices from the MLM company. He got sad, not because he wanted any birthday present, but because it seemed like she was just trying to get rid them and disguised it as a birthday present. \n\nBecause of that, he just decided to cancel the birthday lunch the next day. He still planned to sign up for the MLM just to keep his mom happy. \n\nShe gave him cash, around 100k PHP and told him to signup a distributor. Then she gave him more cash and told him to add me as his downline. He resisted but she persisted and eventually signed me up. \n\nI received a welcome email from the company. I was upset because they still signed me up even though we agreed not to. I took the matter into my own hands. I called the hotline to cancel my membership.\n\nThey said they will process it and call me back. They called my MIL while she was still with my husband. She got embarrassed and got mad at my husband. \n\nMy husband messaged me telling me to stop the cancellation but I stood my ground and proceeded.\n\nWhen my husband got home and found out I continued with the cancellation, he called his mom to give her a heads up because if she still wants to reach her quota by next Friday, she will have to find a replacement for me.\n\nShe said that because of this, we will just have to live our lives without seeing her again. If there\u2019s family gatherings, she will refuse to go if we are there. This again made my husband sad because for the first time this December, his dad will be home for the holidays. His dad works abroad and is rarely home for the holidays. So this would\u2019ve been the first time in a long time that we\u2019re complete as family. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698414917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ho3l2/aita_for_canceling_a_mlm_membership_my_mil_signed/", "score": 1765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, then I would say shove it in your MILs face that she lost out on a great family and son. You should invite your FIL over, and you would have a peaceful dinner without you MIL.

The only thing more shady than MLMs is time shares!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother concern should be your husband and mother in law have access to all your identifying information.

He can call his dad and maybe they can meet somewhere?", "Mother or not, who wants that kind of manipulative person in their lives? A mothers love isn\u2019t ultimatums and demands. He\u2019s better off without her, and if his family chooses to have that kind of person in there lives he\u2019s better off without them too. \n\nHis dad needs to put his foot down over all her nonsense so he can see his son.

You know you're NTA.", "NTA.  I'd press charges for her fraud.  I really would.", "This is incredibly sad that this woman isn't going to speak to your husband ever again because of a pyramid scheme that she's enthralled by. It must be awful for him, but he's clearly also very mixed up in his head about it because signing you up is In No Way OK. \n\nI get that your husband wants all his family to be together, but I'm not quite sure why, given that the family is apparently ruled by Maleficent.", "Spineless vertebrates all over this story, wtaf", "NTA.  MLMs, as far as I'm concerned, are ill-designed Ponzi schemes.  I've had several of my friends get into them and lose their shirts.\n\nWhat is concerning me is your husband signed you up at his mothers request.  He needs to grow a spine.\n\nHold your line, you're the one showing maturity here.  Looking out for your family's fiscal well-being is NOT being irresponsible, it's a wise call.", "Nope.  NTA.  None of this BS is your problem either..", "Sorry if I'm wrong, you mentioned PHP which I assume you're from Philippines. Based on my experience in this group, western people have different culture than us asian. Western people can be very easy to say 'avoid' over mild inconvenience, even though this is regarding family members.\n\nHere in asia, at least from my country, people would do certain lengths for their shitty family member until decided to quit. In your case, if this MLM activities only requires you to be the a member/downline, without paying for anything else, or attending any mlm activities, I don't see what's wrong with that. Yes they will send you emails but just mark them as spam and you won't be bothered anymore.\n\nFamily members as MLM partner, even just for names, is much safer than recruiting complete stranger, especially of your MIL pays for the products and no money comes from your pocket.", "NTA! She only has conditional Love", "Circumnavigate this selfish MLM cult and get in contact with dad directly. Fucking disgusting excuse for a mom.

MIL is rude and disrespectful", "Real love is not transactional.", "NTA- it really sucks for your husband, but his mom doesn't love him, straight up. That relationship would have been completely one-sided, and all he'd get out of it is an empty bank account. Not to mention you were only holding up *her* end of the bargain, anyway. Hopefully, your husband understands, and the rest of his family doesn't fall for her MLM", "NTA. I was roped into an MLM once. It's fucking awful.", "NTA.", "Others have said it, but you need to hear it at least one more time. Direct me to the part in your story where your MIL signed you up? Your husband did. He did knowing you didn\u2019t want to be and knowing you\u2019d be upset. Your husband signed you up for this nonsense. Direct your anger where it should rightfully go.", "NTA. That's just an AH thing to do to your family. You are better off without her in your lives.", "Mormon mlm?  This is crazy either way. We were approached by friends and family for decades to buy in (we were Mormons then and eventually lived in Utah).  We said no even though we were given horrible guilt trips.  So many scams.

You will struggle, you will suffer, you will scream for help as your body become battered and bruised, and your family will be filled with guilt for not helping, and then when they do help you will drag them down with you. Jumping in the water won\u2019t help, it\u2019s just adding another victim.\n\nThat is what is happening with the MIL, and because the reality is too harsh to believe, she has hope, and that hope is draining her bank account dry, just as the MLM was designed to do. OP is NTA, but their husband is, and it\u2019s debatable if the MIL is too. The affect the MIL\u2019s actions is having on others is terrible, but it\u2019s what you do if you\u2019re drowning.\n\nOP is doing the right thing by staying away from this, and will almost certainly need their husband to stay away from it too. If he can\u2019t back out ASAP, I\u2019m worried he will try to drag OP down as well.", "Mil is literally in the hey hun cult and is so brainwashed she's literally willing to sign up their family against their will.

I can't believe how many people have glossed over it.", "Can I upvote this 100 more times please?! \ud83d\ude06", "MLM\u2019s are, by nature, a predatory business model. They will actively encourage their members to use aggressive and manipulative tactics, as they make more money for the up lines that way. I doubt she would get more than a platitude from the company, (while they might start suggesting their down lines copy MIL\u2019s behaviour).", "Definitely agree that it\u2019s a scam. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. \n\nSince MIL was the one covering the membership cost with her own money, my husband just decided to let her do what she wants with her own money and let her use his name. She said that he wouldn\u2019t have to spend anything even though he\u2019s signed up as a distributor (which I told him not to believe.) \n\nI told him that he\u2019s allowing his mother to be scammed but he said that\u2019s all her decision and in his perspective, it shouldn\u2019t impact us. His goal was really to just get her to start talking and spending time with him and didn\u2019t see any risk in what he\u2019s doing.\n\nHe was really set on going just to clear the air between them. And he felt like not going would have pushed her farther away. \n\nI was not okay with him going but understood the sadness he felt not being able to talk to his mom so I let him go so they could start talking again, not because I was okay with him joining an MLM.", "Movie was Talk to Me. She said watching stuff like that will summon demons and my husband just argued it\u2019s fictional so it\u2019s fine. But she felt as if he disrespected her already and stopped talking to him.", "Thanks for sharing this perspective. Agree on what you mentioned about coming from an Asian country. That\u2019s why I was conflicted.

She's going to lean on your husband until he's bullied into making \\*you\\* comply with all her wishes.
