Of course choosing to sleep with someone you're not in a serious relationship with doesn't make you an AH, but to do so knowing that it would negatively affect those closest to you does. It's selfish and self-serving. People will argue that it's not his business, which I would usually agree with, but when you entered into this casual relationship KNOWING that it would negatively affect his friendships, you made it his business. You stated it was a casual relationship, which means it could have been with anyone, but you made the choice to sleep with someone that had a friendship with your step-brother, knowing that your actions could damage that friendship. That makes you and Adam an AH's as well. Especially doing so in secret.\n\nShould've just came out with it and been adults about the whole thing. \"Hey me and Adam are casually hooking up, if you're not alright with me sleeping with one of your friends then you might want to reevaluate your friendship with Adam\". At that point it's on your step-brother to either figure out a way to be ok with it, or stop being friends with Adam.\n\nIf I make a decision that benefits me knowing it would be at the detriment of someone else, I'm not only an AH, but a selfish one.", "You skipped over the gifts.

She's a Lady of the Knight!", "Standing up tall and doing something \u201cgood\u201d tends to change the vibe, change how people see you.
