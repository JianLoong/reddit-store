My daughter has been institutionalised a multitude of times due to her relationship with her mother and responses to this. \n\nAfter her last argument in our home, I had to take her on a drive to calm her down and on this drive we were talking and she disclosed how happy she was to never speak to my wife (her mother) again, when she leaves for college. She carried on trying to get under my skin as she always does when she gets upset. She started to go on about \u201chow she has never had a home\u201d and when I asked her to clarify she said \u201cI don\u2019t have a fucking home, I have a house that I can live in, but will never have a home because of all of you\u201d. \n\nI felt upset by this statement and felt like a failed father. I told her that \u201cshe should not expect to come to our Christmas stay then\u201d, she said \u201cgood, I was hoping you\u2019d say that\u201d. I told her that \u201c I wasn\u2019t kidding and told her that I would cancel her flight ticket in front of her\u201d. She proceeded to tell me \u201cto do it\u201d and that \u201cshe never wanted to come anyways\u201d. I did it. She saw me do it. She proceeded to get out of my car after another five minutes and just walked in the opposite direction of our house. I asked her what she was doing and she said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t expect her back\u201d. \n\nIt has been a whole day since and she hasn\u2019t been back though I know she is staying with her best friend and has attended school.

YTA. You call this \"carrying on trying to get under your skin\"....What *I* see is a daughter telling you how she fucking feels. \n\nLet me get this straight. Your wife and sons constantly talk about how much better life would be without her around. Your daughter has been institutionalized because of this- because HER OWN MOTHER talks about how much better everything would be without her. Your daughter expresses (and I can't fucking blame her for feeling this way) that she feels like she doesn't have a home because of this. \n\nAnd you have the AUDACITY. To claim that she is \"trying to get under your skin?\"\n\nOP, I have something personal to share with you. Because my parents are just like you. My parents assume that everything I say, every criticism of them, is just me. Being childish and trying to hurt them. Trying to \"get under their skin\". They REFUSE, point blank, to accept that they have any part in our ongoing (almost two decades) of family issues- despite the fact that when they started? I was a CHILD. \n\nI now do not speak to my parents. I do not intend to maintain a relationship with them at all, considering that they still treat me, an almost-28 year old adult who has been out of their house since I was 18, like a willful child who is trying to *get under their skin*. \n\nYou have a choice here. You can either step up, accept responsibility, and do something for your daughter other than sticking her in therapy with her abuser (her own mother. Says she wishes YOUR DAUGHTER DIDN'T EXIST). Otherwise? Well. Enjoy not having a daughter. Although, based on the tone of this post? Maybe you want that.", "YTA. Not having a safe relationship with your parents is one of the most damaging things that can happen to a child. It creates worse trauma than any other type of abuse. Your daughter is obviously struggling for her life and you just disregard her and make her life feel even less safe. \n\nDo you have any idea what it's like when the hospital feels safer than your own home? No, you don't. It's the worst feeling in the world, coming out that door and facing your parents. \n\nLet your daughter go to college and be free. You are a failed father.", "YTA. She is 18. Her mother talks about how life would have been nicer without her. Treats her entirely differently to how her siblings are treat. And when she lashes out, seeking your support, you cancel Christmas with her. She is 18, with only friends to depend on. I really hope one of her friends has a family who are more capable of love than you are. She's going to need someone to help her move on from all your mess. What a disgrace you are.", "I think she meant a home as in she never felt that sense of peace and comfort in a space just for her.

The thing about being a parent is that you have to show unconditional love to your kids no matter what.

You shouldn't punish her for feeling the way she does just because you don't understand it. \n\nIn my opinion, you should reach out and have a real conversation with her, even if it hurts, and find out what she meant, in her own words, about not having a home. \n\nKids depend on us for so much and as they get older we forget that they are still young. We assume they should know how to have an adult conversation about feelings all the time,  when we ourselves as parents sometimes react out of anger...

I say this because I saw my stepmum do this to my brother he would tell counsellors/therapists about the emotional abuse and neglect he faced from her (and my dad being at work and not physically seeing it believed her when she said he was lying).You\u2019ll be lucky if your daughter ever speaks to you again.

If your daughter does not feel safe and at home in your house, that is a feeling that you can't just... tell her not to have. That's not how feelings and relationships work.

But my dad never protected me from her because he didn't know! Now he lost me forever, because my mental health is better without her in my life than having him in my life. My suggestion is, stop trying to fix their relationship, that isn't your place to do! You need to have separate relationships with each human as their own self and not expect them to have one with each other! If you love your daughter you'll quit picking sides and YES you're picking sides when trying to fix them because you're fixing your wife's problems while ignoring your daughters! I know this is hard because you want to see all your loved ones getting along, but some times this isn't possible. Your daughter may not feel like it's not her home because of you and it may not have anything to do with you but she includes you because all she sees is you trying to fix them instead of having your own relationship with her!\n\nEdit: everytime I speak to my mother I go into a bad downward spiral. I go into really bad manic episodes and that can literally cost me my life! Mental health issues can be caused by other humans. Trauma is a real thing even if you didn't see the thing that caused that trauma. You should sit down and have a heart to heart talk with your daughter and find out WHY she feels the way she does, instead of being angry at her feelings because at the end of the day, you don't have the right to tell someone how they should feel about something, that's just not your place! She has every right to feel how she feels. You do however, have the right to be angry about the actions to the way she feels!", "YTA and your feelings were spot on. You gave failed as a father.

My daughter has been institutionalised a multitude of times due to her relationship with her mother and responses to this. \n\nAfter her last argument in our home, I had to take her on a drive to calm her down and on this drive we were talking and she disclosed how happy she was to never speak to my wife (her mother) again, when she leaves for college. She carried on trying to get under my skin as she always does when she gets upset. She started to go on about \u201chow she has never had a home\u201d and when I asked her to clarify she said \u201cI don\u2019t have a fucking home, I have a house that I can live in, but will never have a home because of all of you\u201d. \n\nI felt upset by this statement and felt like a failed father. I told her that \u201cshe should not expect to come to our Christmas stay then\u201d, she said \u201cgood, I was hoping you\u2019d say that\u201d. I told her that \u201c I wasn\u2019t kidding and told her that I would cancel her flight ticket in front of her\u201d. She proceeded to tell me \u201cto do it\u201d and that \u201cshe never wanted to come anyways\u201d. I did it. She saw me do it. She proceeded to get out of my car after another five minutes and just walked in the opposite direction of our house. I asked her what she was doing and she said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t expect her back\u201d. \n\nIt has been a whole day since and she hasn\u2019t been back though I know she is staying with her best friend and has attended school.

We need to know, at least some, details about your daughter and wife's relationship, what are some of the things they fight about? \n\nOne of my sisters had a relationship like this with my mom when she was 17-19ish. My father had gone to prison and instead of blaming him, the only person that put him there, she blamed our mother. They fought constantly, if my mother didn't approve of something it was what my sister was going to do (whether she actually liked it or not) if my mother did approve of something, my sister would never come near it. She was put in a facility at one point because she tried to run away and told my mother she would unalive herself if she came after her. The thing is my sister had absolutely no where to go, she would have been on the streets. That was an extremely tough time on us all but my mother most of all, and none of us understood that at the time. With all the stress she was under she didn't handle my sister's mental health issues right, ya know mainly because she was having her own. Thankfully they have both grown and we all have a wonderful relationship with each other but that was an extremely hard time.\n\nBut to be completely honest with you OP this situation sounds completely different, it doesn't sound like one specific thing has set your daughter off and my mother no matter how pissed off she was would ever say she didn't want one of us kids around EVER.

You are a failure as a father because you've allowed this and the second she hurt your feelings you basically kicked her out of the family.

Sounds terrible, yes, but just being honest here.\n\nEDIT: correction from \"own family\" to mother.", "Exactly, \n\nSomething huge is going on with the girl her parents clearly cannot deal with and are struggling but honestly the need to get their S**t together, a child especially one with special needs, requires their adults to support them and do their best, figure it out.\n\nAlso his kid is currently homeless or couch surfing,  and his response is let's see if strangers think I'm an A ?\n\nDoes he know the statistics on mentally ill homeless people?", "Or you know an abusive parent.  It's more common than you think.", "I was the daughter.", "At least he won\u2019t ever see his child ever again so no more problems", "I also see a lot of people using mental illness as an excuse.\n\nMental illness does not excuse the actions she's done, or the way she treats people. I have borderline and I understand how hard it is to keep things together, but actions have consequences. This behavior deserved a consequence. And besides, if she didn't want to go, she doesn't need to go.\n\nStop using mental illness as an excuse to say and treat people however you want. It isn't right and I think we should all still hold people accountable for their actions.", "Yes I did, and we have different assessments. With the limited information we have it appears that both the wife and the daughter are being difficult and have difficult relationships but that generally the dad and the brothers have good relationships overall. \n\nI believe him when he says that she\u2019s trying to get under his skin and sometimes that has to have consequences. I do hope their relationship gets better but I don\u2019t think that he is TA.", "Look, they blamed me for MAKING THEM buy a house when I was \\~7. In hindsight the claims of responsibility for all our family's ills were so ridiculous, but of course as a child you're so dependent on your parents emotionally (and mine had also cut me off from the world as much as possible) that you don't perceive how absurd it all is.", "I read it the same way you did at first, but I do think he meant they were talking about each other. But yeah 100% agree with you, a teen saying that, while still hurtful, it doesn't carry the same weight. A mother should never say something like that about their child, ever. I think he has a wife problem more than a daughter problem for sure.", "I mean,  mine said shit like that when I was a kid. \n\nKnow who hasn't heard from me in 7 years and who will die without ever hearing from me again?\n\nI hope this girl gets far away from these people and never has to see any of them again.", "Same!", "So was I.", "Absolutely. Anything can be a *reason* that you\u2019re acting shitty but there is never an *excuse*."]}
