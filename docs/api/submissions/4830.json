My daughter has been institutionalised a multitude of times due to her relationship with her mother and responses to this. \n\nAfter her last argument in our home, I had to take her on a drive to calm her down and on this drive we were talking and she disclosed how happy she was to never speak to my wife (her mother) again, when she leaves for college. She carried on trying to get under my skin as she always does when she gets upset. She started to go on about \u201chow she has never had a home\u201d and when I asked her to clarify she said \u201cI don\u2019t have a fucking home, I have a house that I can live in, but will never have a home because of all of you\u201d. \n\nI felt upset by this statement and felt like a failed father. I told her that \u201cshe should not expect to come to our Christmas stay then\u201d, she said \u201cgood, I was hoping you\u2019d say that\u201d. I told her that \u201c I wasn\u2019t kidding and told her that I would cancel her flight ticket in front of her\u201d. She proceeded to tell me \u201cto do it\u201d and that \u201cshe never wanted to come anyways\u201d. I did it. She saw me do it. She proceeded to get out of my car after another five minutes and just walked in the opposite direction of our house. I asked her what she was doing and she said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t expect her back\u201d. \n\nIt has been a whole day since and she hasn\u2019t been back though I know she is staying with her best friend and has attended school.

YTA. You call this \"carrying on trying to get under your skin\"....What *I* see is a daughter telling you how she fucking feels. \n\nLet me get this straight. Your wife and sons constantly talk about how much better life would be without her around. Your daughter has been institutionalized because of this- because HER OWN MOTHER talks about how much better everything would be without her. Your daughter expresses (and I can't fucking blame her for feeling this way) that she feels like she doesn't have a home because of this. \n\nAnd you have the AUDACITY. To claim that she is \"trying to get under your skin?\"\n\nOP, I have something personal to share with you. Because my parents are just like you. My parents assume that everything I say, every criticism of them, is just me. Being childish and trying to hurt them. Trying to \"get under their skin\". They REFUSE, point blank, to accept that they have any part in our ongoing (almost two decades) of family issues- despite the fact that when they started? I was a CHILD. \n\nI now do not speak to my parents. I do not intend to maintain a relationship with them at all, considering that they still treat me, an almost-28 year old adult who has been out of their house since I was 18, like a willful child who is trying to *get under their skin*. \n\nYou have a choice here. You can either step up, accept responsibility, and do something for your daughter other than sticking her in therapy with her abuser (her own mother. Says she wishes YOUR DAUGHTER DIDN'T EXIST). Otherwise? Well. Enjoy not having a daughter. Although, based on the tone of this post? Maybe you want that.", "YTA. Not having a safe relationship with your parents is one of the most damaging things that can happen to a child. It creates worse trauma than any other type of abuse. Your daughter is obviously struggling for her life and you just disregard her and make her life feel even less safe. \n\nDo you have any idea what it's like when the hospital feels safer than your own home? No, you don't. It's the worst feeling in the world, coming out that door and facing your parents. \n\nLet your daughter go to college and be free. You are a failed father.", "YTA. She is 18. Her mother talks about how life would have been nicer without her. Treats her entirely differently to how her siblings are treat. And when she lashes out, seeking your support, you cancel Christmas with her. She is 18, with only friends to depend on. I really hope one of her friends has a family who are more capable of love than you are. She's going to need someone to help her move on from all your mess. What a disgrace you are.", "I think she meant a home as in she never felt that sense of peace and comfort in a space just for her.

The thing about being a parent is that you have to show unconditional love to your kids no matter what.

You shouldn't punish her for feeling the way she does just because you don't understand it. \n\nIn my opinion, you should reach out and have a real conversation with her, even if it hurts, and find out what she meant, in her own words, about not having a home. \n\nKids depend on us for so much and as they get older we forget that they are still young. We assume they should know how to have an adult conversation about feelings all the time,  when we ourselves as parents sometimes react out of anger...

If your daughter does not feel safe and at home in your house, that is a feeling that you can't just... tell her not to have. That's not how feelings and relationships work.

But my dad never protected me from her because he didn't know! Now he lost me forever, because my mental health is better without her in my life than having him in my life. My suggestion is, stop trying to fix their relationship, that isn't your place to do! You need to have separate relationships with each human as their own self and not expect them to have one with each other! If you love your daughter you'll quit picking sides and YES you're picking sides when trying to fix them because you're fixing your wife's problems while ignoring your daughters! I know this is hard because you want to see all your loved ones getting along, but some times this isn't possible. Your daughter may not feel like it's not her home because of you and it may not have anything to do with you but she includes you because all she sees is you trying to fix them instead of having your own relationship with her!\n\nEdit: everytime I speak to my mother I go into a bad downward spiral. I go into really bad manic episodes and that can literally cost me my life! Mental health issues can be caused by other humans. Trauma is a real thing even if you didn't see the thing that caused that trauma. You should sit down and have a heart to heart talk with your daughter and find out WHY she feels the way she does, instead of being angry at her feelings because at the end of the day, you don't have the right to tell someone how they should feel about something, that's just not your place! She has every right to feel how she feels. You do however, have the right to be angry about the actions to the way she feels!", "YTA and your feelings were spot on. You gave failed as a father.

My daughter has been institutionalised a multitude of times due to her relationship with her mother and responses to this. \n\nAfter her last argument in our home, I had to take her on a drive to calm her down and on this drive we were talking and she disclosed how happy she was to never speak to my wife (her mother) again, when she leaves for college. She carried on trying to get under my skin as she always does when she gets upset. She started to go on about \u201chow she has never had a home\u201d and when I asked her to clarify she said \u201cI don\u2019t have a fucking home, I have a house that I can live in, but will never have a home because of all of you\u201d. \n\nI felt upset by this statement and felt like a failed father. I told her that \u201cshe should not expect to come to our Christmas stay then\u201d, she said \u201cgood, I was hoping you\u2019d say that\u201d. I told her that \u201c I wasn\u2019t kidding and told her that I would cancel her flight ticket in front of her\u201d. She proceeded to tell me \u201cto do it\u201d and that \u201cshe never wanted to come anyways\u201d. I did it. She saw me do it. She proceeded to get out of my car after another five minutes and just walked in the opposite direction of our house. I asked her what she was doing and she said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t expect her back\u201d. \n\nIt has been a whole day since and she hasn\u2019t been back though I know she is staying with her best friend and has attended school.

We need to know, at least some, details about your daughter and wife's relationship, what are some of the things they fight about? \n\nOne of my sisters had a relationship like this with my mom when she was 17-19ish. My father had gone to prison and instead of blaming him, the only person that put him there, she blamed our mother. They fought constantly, if my mother didn't approve of something it was what my sister was going to do (whether she actually liked it or not) if my mother did approve of something, my sister would never come near it. She was put in a facility at one point because she tried to run away and told my mother she would unalive herself if she came after her. The thing is my sister had absolutely no where to go, she would have been on the streets. That was an extremely tough time on us all but my mother most of all, and none of us understood that at the time. With all the stress she was under she didn't handle my sister's mental health issues right, ya know mainly because she was having her own. Thankfully they have both grown and we all have a wonderful relationship with each other but that was an extremely hard time.\n\nBut to be completely honest with you OP this situation sounds completely different, it doesn't sound like one specific thing has set your daughter off and my mother no matter how pissed off she was would ever say she didn't want one of us kids around EVER.

You are a failure as a father because you've allowed this and the second she hurt your feelings you basically kicked her out of the family.

YTA.", "You summed that up perfectly", "Reading it, it seems like he totally knows he's TA but is really hoping someone tells him he's not.   \n\n\nWon't be me.", "Satan has commented that he had nothing to do with this u/Pale-Item7524's behavior and that OP is indeed an AH all on his own.", "That's an insult to Satan!", "nothing much else to say. OP YTA.", "everything you said. plus after all of this just happened he's here trying to make sure he isn't an asshole, when he should be scared for his family and trying to help his daughter.", "My sympathies, good Redditor.", "Not \"troubled\". ABUSED. There's nothing wrong with the daughter, it's the rest of the family who's fucked up enough to torture her for 18 years.", "This. At first I thought maybe she was exaggerating then he had to go & demonstrate she was correct about everything", "If she \u201cmade him feel\u201d like he failed as a father, maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s because he failed as a father \ud83e\udd2f", "Yup this is hard to call without knowing what\u2019s going on between them. A lot of people here are just assuming the mom is some monster and the daughter is a victim of abuse and is right to act in the way she did. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened between them and without that context it can\u2019t be judged either way.", "Gosh what a hellish time you had and I\u2019m so glad you are out of it. Can you press charges?", "You get to say \"Boo!\"", "Because the part where they threw a Halloween themed party was more important that what the party was actually for. Basically, them making the effort thinking up the party was more important than the fact that the daughter was celebrating her own milestone.", "Either way it's not relevant", "Isn't it magnificent? I can now swat her nagging voice out  of my head easily.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing her obituary when it happens, tbh.", "I wish I\u2019d gone extra LC with my mother years earlier than I did. She died in 2014 and all I felt was sheer relief.", "I'll be honest- While I recognize that sometimes inpatient treatment is the best thing for a person (especially if they pose threat of imminent harm to themself and/or others, or situations where being in an inpatient setting will allow them to recover as quickly as possible)... Yeah, I don't trust that either. \n\nEspecially given the history of, and current way, mental health institutions are used to control people. More info is needed for sure. WHY was OP's daughter institutionalized? Was she posing an imminent threat to herself or others? \n\nSource- I have my degree in Social Work and yeah I absolutely do not just across the board trust that shit.", "I\u2019m so sorry you experienced that. It\u2019s *very* common, unfortunately. It\u2019s such a horrible revelation to realize that the \u201cgood\u201d parent is often as bad if not worse than our abusers.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re in a better place now.", "Her plans just started a little bit earlier, but I am sure she is happy and thriving already. Wish nothing but the best for her", "Thank you for posting that link. Truly fascinating and informative.", "Adding to this that he did include the fact that his wife and sons talk about how much better their lives would be if his daughter wasn't alive, which makes the unsaid contents of the arguments that much worse because I can't imagine how much more awful they would be. How long do you sink as a mother after you openly tell your child you wish they were never born? Especially if that's not the worst thing you've said to her? I feel so bad for his daughter. I hope she finds peace with people who LOVE and VALUE her.\n\nYTA 100x OP.", "He also just says that the daughter was institutionalized multiple times because of the relationship with her mother. No further explanation. Like what exactly went down for that to happen?", "yeah, \"how her mother treats her brothers\" is doing a lot of work here, and I'm betting that it's more like \"the fact she is treated worse than our male children, for some inexplicable reason that isn't because she isn't a boy, it's just a coincidence our only daughter is the only one who is 100% miserable in this family and has zero people on her side in anything ever.\"", "Yes, thank you. So often people just throw out \u201ctherapy!\u201d Wo considering the necessary work that is needed to go along with it. *Family* therapy requires full familial participation. That doesn\u2019t seem to be happening here. \n\nDad and mom both are ultimate AHs here. Feel so sorry for the daughter.", "Sounds like OP should join them", "> I put them into family counselling for this\n\nDid you not join? Are you not part of this family? Dude. This is your family, your problem, your creation as much as it is anyone\u2019s. You need therapy at least as much as anyone else. \n\nYour daughter is a genuine poor little rich girl.", ">All the family counseling in the world isn\u2019t going to help unless you\u2019re willing to truly listen to why your daughter is struggling\n\nYTA.\n\nI'm getting a strong sense of the [missing missing reasons](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html). The OP keeps mentioning the results of things:  \n\n1. \"they don\u2019t get along\", \n2. \"they don\u2019t trust each other\", \n3. \"she has an issue with how her mother treats her brothers\"\n4. \"they always talk about how life would have been significantly better \u201cif the other wasn\u2019t here\u201d\"\n\nBut he's not explicit in examples. He's not admitting to witnessing or participating in things he and his wife have done. There was a reason why his daughter stopped trusting her mother.", "He weighed the options and chose the sacrifice of a person", "But that would require some semblance of personal accountability! Logic doesn't seem to be this guy's thing lol", "It sounds like she\u2019s tried to commit suicide a number of times tbh.", "I feel like it\u2019s glossed over to fast. He says it was because of her reaction of being told by her mom she would be better without her. \n\nI have a feeling OP\u2019s daughter hurt herself. Badly.", "I wish but I was wayyyy by pass the age by the time I knew I could press charges. It would have never held unfortunately.", "It makes me wonder what undiagnosed mental health issues the Mom has.", ">he did include the fact that his wife and sons talk about how much better their lives would be if his daughter wasn't alive, \n\nWhere did you read that?  I read \"they always talk about how life would have been significantly better \u201cif the other wasn\u2019t here\u201d.  That does not read that they wish daughter wasn't alive but wish she wasn't living in the house.", "That\u2019s an explanation, not an excuse.\n\nShe will likely break the cycle by living her own life and not having children.", "It's not on the daughter, who is only now an adult, to stop that cycle. The mom, or at minimum OP, were supposed to do that. The daughter now has to do a lot of work in order to heal from the mom's abuse; getting out of that house is probably the best thing for her. Hopefully she'll do enough of that work so that she can be a better parent if/when the time comes for her to raise a child, but she can't fix hateful, abusive, self-centered parents on her own. Especially when those parents are busy complaining about her on AITA.", "That\u2019s my question too! Like what kind of arguments/events took place that led to the daughter being institutionalized not once but MULTIPLE TIMES? I almost get the impression that the daughter was severely depressed and potentially had suicidal ideations or something along those lines. I can imagine it would be easy to become depressive when your own mother says that she wishes you weren\u2019t here.", "I can\u2019t imagine hearing MY WIFE say that they would be better without MY KID. Seriously how did he not go insane hearing his wife say that? \n\nHe and his wife are the adults in the room and they are trying to one-up their 18 year-old on pain exchange. No wonder therapy isn\u2019t helping.", "My step dad did constantly and I was forced to call him daddy \n\nPeople such and then go on having kids and treating them the way they feel about themselves", "I don\u2019t have to imagine it: it sucks. That she figured out NC at 18 gives me hope that she\u2019ll find her worth sooner then I did", "It hurts - a lot.", "My mother never said it but she\u2019s shown me how I am the last, and the least, in her love every chance she gets. The rest of my family adores me and I only put up with her to see them when it\u2019s unavoidable. It\u2019s complicated, but they protect me from her and understand when I can\u2019t be there when she is.", "Maybe OP can clarify, I read that statement as the brother and sister agreed that life would have been better if the other wasn\u2019t there. \n\nBut that\u2019s just the way I interpreted it.", "Mine told me she regretted the day I was born. It definitely still affects our relationship. The only reason I never went NC was because of my dad.", "I would be willing to bet actual cash that \"therapy\" means \"We sent our daughter to a therapist hoping that the therapist would fix her because she's clearly the problem\". \n\nMy parents tried that. Unfortunately for them (and fortunately for me), my therapist was awesome and started teaching me that I'm a person who's allowed to have needs. Current therapist is just as awesome.", "That\u2019s what I think too. \n\nBut I bet OP will turn this into \u00ab\u00a0she was only trying to get our attention\u00a0\u00bb.", "Another for the emotionally abusive parents club.\n\nThe sad and honest truth is that a whole lot of people have kids because it's expected of them or because of circumstance -- not because they actually want to raise a child or are capable of doing so. And sometimes it really shows.", "Shit, if I ever heard a relative or friend say this about their kid? They would get an earful and a half from me about it.", "Right?? It really shows the lack of love OP has for his own damn child. Easiest verdict of YTA I have seen in a while.", "My dad always says \"you know your mother will never change\" and has been saying this for 10 years. He wasn't even surprised when I said I wanted to go low contact with her. He can't defend himself or me against her unfortunately.", "Came here to say this. As much as I hate my mother, I have never once said I wish she wasn't here or wasn't my mother. It was always \"I wish I'd never been born, cause not existing would be better than this\". She always agreed that her life would be significantly better off if she'd aborted me. A year and a half NC, and I plan to keep that up until I can spit on her grave and tell her what a spiteful bitch she is", "For real. I remember asking the artist formerly known as my mother why they'd had me, and she went \"that's what you do\". You get engaged, you get married, you have a child, you buy a house : the natural order of things ! And then you can be a crappy parent because you resent your firstborn for ruining your life.", "As a kid who was an \u201caccident\u201d (which then meant my parents \u201chad\u201d to get married), I was ridiculed for being like my father (because they divorced when I was very young\u2014surprise\u2014and what better way to raise your kid than with undisguised scorn). \n\nMy other siblings were openly loved and I was tolerated. But without going into a long rant about it, I just wanted to share this gem my mother told adult me after she had been caught in some lie or other (which I pointed out and asked for an apology):\n\n\u201cI never have to apologize, because I\u2019m never wrong.\u201d"]}
