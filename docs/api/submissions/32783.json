You had access to the cleaning supplies and they did not. As you spend more time in food service and customer service, you will likely have to unfuck situations far more inconsiderate and gross than this.", "I'll be honest. I've had points where I have asked, apologetically, for people to clean up after my kids has puked. But that is because the kids is crying, and I'm dropping whatever I had planned to take them home, put them in clean clothes and comfort them.

So, no, a barista, who is handling customers' food items should not be cleaning up vomit. You were right.", "NTA.\nBut its safe to presume if a parent is shitty enough to drag a dick child around with them to a restaurant, they're shitty enough to not look after their own messes.\n\nAmd anyone that goes \"you don't know how hard it is being a parent\" you duck. Stop using \"being a parent' ad an excuse for being a shitty parent.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sick of parents acting like this. I was at Pizza Hut the other night and ended up leaving after barely eating because of the way two parents were allowing their monsters to behave. They were watching them deliberately throw food and drink all over the floor, smear it all over the tables and at one point even threw a cup at another customer, the parents laughed until the man got up and walked over to them with the cup and then they half apologised while still laughing. I wished I was the manager of that store they'd have been cleaning the mess and getting the fuck out of there. So\nno, NTA. Fucking sick to death of these disgusting, entitled degenerates.", "NTA: You get minimum wage, not enough to handle biohazards... I get it though- if they weren't gonna do it, and you weren't either, no one would handle it at all. Sigh ://", "NTA. I worked in a hospital for a  couple of years as a cleaner. Specifically for the kids floor, I don\u2019t think in the years I was there, a parent ever stood and expected me to clean their kids vomit. I would do it, but they ALWAYS were down on the floor before me trying to clean it. Bare in mind too these are very stressed/worried parents. \n\nGood to note also, as a hospital cleaner vomit/blood wasn\u2019t actually my job. Always helped with no issue or done it, but the healthcare assistants were supposed to handle it first and we cleaned after. Something to do with training for bodily fluids I think. I\u2019d never expect any staff member anywhere, to clean my sick or my child\u2019s.", "\nNTA\n\nI've been the parent with a kid who threw up. I wanted to clean but I was  not allowed due to health and safety.", "NTA. He clearly had paper towels so he should have put some effort into cleaning it up. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he makes his wife clean up after the child when they\u2019re at home.", "That's  not her job. I had a kid go in my bathroom  at work. Stuff papertowles down toilet. Hid them behind the waterheater. Made mess. That was the last time she was allowed  n my bathroom.  I looked right at brat girl. Well old enough to know better, and said n front of her parent due to a certain person goin in my bathroom and trashing it. Flooding the floor and trying to hide it. Leaving mess for me to clean. It's no longer public. My rules r simple u make a mess, and u will clean it. Im not a fing maid.", "absolutely NTA. his kid, his problem.", "NTA. Glad you told him. Nasty parents deserve to be told.", "Did you provide the parent with rubber gloves, a mop, and disinfectant?  Sure you did.\n\nPresumably food places have staff trained to clean up bio hazards.  And the equipment to do so properly.\n\nWhat were the parents supposed to do, go after it with paper napkins/serviettes (depending where you're writing from)?  That should do the trick.\n\nSurely the food place in question has a protocol for this, and this would probably include you doing your job so everyone who enters and works there gets proper sanitation.\n\nYTA", "NTA, but it was the staff's responsibility to clean up, not the parent's. Most businesses don't want the liability of allowing a customer to \"clean\" the floor, and possibly leave it slippery and dangerous for others. OP doesn't mention it, but was the dad tending to his child at this time? Taking the child to the bathroom to wash face and hands, etc.? The parent's first consideration should have been child's health and safety. I would hope that if the dad had some cash, that he left the staff a big tip and a verbal apology.", "Sure your cousin said that.", "Any food or drink establishmrnt should have trained maintenance staff who are prepared to handle this situation. Whose job it is should be made clear at hiring.\n\nKudos to you for taking care of it so it didn't track through the whole place or send customers running. \n\nThere is a substance similar to kitty litter, except it has germ-killing properties, that can be thrown on top of the mess, absorb it, and then be swept up quickly.\n\nI'd  let management know that they need to get this stuff and a maintenance person to do it from now on. Or get the person who cleams the bathrooms to do it.\n\nI'm sure that your local health department will enforce this!!", "Customers don't have the tools to clean up messes like that and often they don't know how to use yours (since commercial cleaning products are quite different from residential).\n\nThis is an unfortunate part of the job in any business", "Yta simply cause it's your job as a service worker. They could have just left it for you to discover several hours later as a crusty mess. And I'm not saying this to talk down on you. I have been in your exact position except with feces on more than one occasion (and it was always adults shitting themselves never children surprisingly). \n\nIt sucks but you just gotta deal with it. A good parent would have said \"where's a mop? let me help\" but unfortunately they're not obligated to do that.", "YTA. No you have no right to expect a customer to clean up after themselves. Don't like the idea of cleaning someone's vomit, get another job. You should get a better attitude, your boss should have fired you, when you told the customer he should be cleaning up. That is the job. Grow up. Stop acting like an entitled toddler", "YTA He did try to clean it up. What do you think the paper towels were for?", "Does this place not have a mop? Why was anyone on the floor wiping puke up\u2026 do you have a station with cleaning supplies for customers to use because otherwise it seems paper towels were probably all the parent had access to. Who cleans the bathrooms? \n\nYTA for misplacing your anger.", "YTA", "As a parent I would want to clean and\nas a worker I would help out.\n\nThe father should have done more, but I am guessing he is not used to do more than to leave the mess for his wife to fix it\u2026 people usually bahave better outside of the home\u2026\n\nI would have spoken to my boss and ask what the protocoll are in these situations.", "Not sure about where you live, but where I'm from, they do not want us to clean up the floor because of health risk. Works differently in different country of course.", "This happened to me too before when I worked at a bookstore. I was a cashier at that time and this one lil girl just threw up right in front of me. With the smell and all, I was about to throw up too. The mom was apologetic but there was one woman, dunno who, literally scolded and insulted me in front of everyone. I was just trying not to puke, okay? Not like I scold the girl or anything. There was also one time, a kid literally pooped in the store, most probably didn't wear diapers. The parents just left. No apology at all, literally left without saying anything.\n\nAll this sucks but yeah, that's customer service for you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude43", "I used to be a barista and was told that I was not expected to clean up bodily fluids because I worked with food.\n\nWas there someone else on shift who didn't work with food that could have cleaned it?\n\nUnfortunately, some parents don't feel the need to clean up after their kids in public places. It sucks, but there it is.", "NTA. He should have cleaned it. He\u2019d have to do it at home too. And no your cousin is wrong. Technically, I know in my state, that unless your trained in it, it\u2019s not your job to clean biohazard and they can\u2019t make you. Managers are trained in it.", "NTA, but fun fact, unless you have a certificate stating you can cleaning biohazard material (urine, poop, vomit) you can refuse and not get fired for it in America", "NTA I\u2019m convinced that 50% of parents today shouldn\u2019t be parents", "NTA", "NTA. But I bet he would have done exactly the same at home and made the kid's mum deal with it.", "Any time my child has been sick in public I go to clean it up but always someone steps in and insists to clean it up for me. \n\nI agree, the parent should do the majority of the gross work.", "NTA, I worked in a children's soft play centre. You name it, I cleaned it. 98% of the time, the parents would run up to the counter to announce their child's mess (if they told you at all), follow you to the crime scene, and then vacantly watch you whilst their child is back on the equipment. My manager had to tell people to take their soiled/unwell children home countless times!", "Reminds me of a story I read on \"Not always right\", where a mother took her kid shopping and told the kid it would feel better once SHE had \"item\" (idk what it was, I think it may have been tampons). Kid told the cashier that it felt sick but will be better once its mom got her \"item\". Mom said to kid that they will be home soon and its not that bad and to just be patient for a few minutes more. Then, kid threw up on the floor. At least the mom was embarassed, but she just left. And the kid said it felt better while they went away, so it was true that it will feel better once mom had her \"item\". \n\nNTA. People should not place their own wants over their children's needs. If you are a parent, that means your wants are moving back, children's needs come first. And some of children's wants are before yours, as well, eg you should buy a toy for christmas before spending all money on cigarettes for yourself. So if the child is sick, you dont \"shop one thing first\" and dont \"get a coffee first\". You cater to the child and maybe you can ask someone to help out so you can buy stuff or ask somebody to bring you stuff when they go shopping. It sucks, but its what parenthood means. These parents probably dismissed their kid's concern or uneasiness or complaints and thought that the kid will handle it and be fine or exeggarrated \"for attention\" (children rarely do, they just tell how it is and it is a way bigger thing for them than for adults) or that \"coffe first\" will be fine or is important.", "Nah.\n\nBeen in service for ten years, bartending for 4 of them. I've had alot of people puke in bars- that's management work. Last time they tried to get me to clean vomit, I told then I expected biohazard pay and a suit. Unsurprisingly they didn't take me up on it.\n\nOP, don't clean up other people's vomit/bodily fluids in general. It's disgusting and definitely not in your minimum wage pay grade. Let management deal with it next time.", "It\u2019s not their job though.

We didn\u2019t have one beyond the staff toilet, and my manager, taking pity on him (he was old and known to her as a somewhat regular customer) allowed him to use it. When he was done, he thanked us and left, but he left a whole mess in there. Poop and blood. I didn\u2019t bother going to look. One of the other women saw it though and told the manager, and she didn\u2019t ask any of us to clean it. Instead she took it upon herself - grabbed the bleach, donned some gloves, and set to work. I was scared she\u2019d ask me seeing as I was the youngest, and I was prepared to say no as I didn\u2019t have proper training nor enough PPE, but I don\u2019t think it ever crossed her mind. She let him use it, she\u2019s the manager - so she cleaned it.\n\nWe never saw him again after that - general consensus was he had bowel cancer or some such and might have died. Or maybe he was just too embarrassed to return. I\u2019ll never know!", "Sometimes it's unpredictable.", "There it is! As an establishment, you run the risk of customers throwing up. Especially if it is a child friendly establishment. Is it shitty you had to do it? Yes, absolutely. Personally, i\u2019d be way too embarrassed not to clean up after my kid because of the judgement. But, the truth is that it really isn\u2019t the dad\u2019s responsibility. It\u2019s the janitor\u2019s. If there isn\u2019t one, it\u2019s likely yours OP.

I wouldn\u2019t even call OP T A because it seems, as your comment addresses, OP doesn\u2019t know the correct procedure for cleaning up vomit and that is poor training, which falls on management, making management T A here. \nNAH, OP, but there is some good advice in this comment.", "Nice try but\u2026 nope. Not the same.", "Why is he taking a sick child out in public?", "Yeah and then your latte would be even more expensive than it already is if biohazard cleanup was also part of this \u201ctrained maintenance staff\u201d duties. \ud83d\ude44 instead it gets passed on to someone working minimum wage who cannot even afford rent and is not making enough money for that crap.
