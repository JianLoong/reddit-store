Honestly depending on what the dad was wrestling with, and the sheer embarrassment of having his kid puke in a public space, you could have a little sympathy.  My kid threw up at the table in a restaurant as a toddler.  I tried to clean it up but didn't have the equipment at the ready.\n\nFurthermore, my 17 year old son works for a grocery store chain.  If he has to clean up hazards, they provide him with PPE to clean it up.", "First job?", "NTA but as others have stated, this comes with the territory when you work in customer service and you are charged with maintaining an area where things will inevitably get spilled and people will inevitably get sick. You had access to the cleaning supplies and they did not. As you spend more time in food service and customer service, you will likely have to unfuck situations far more inconsiderate and gross than this.", "I'll be honest. I've had points where I have asked, apologetically, for people to clean up after my kids has puked. But that is because the kids is crying, and I'm dropping whatever I had planned to take them home, put them in clean clothes and comfort them.

Haha no! Clean after your crotch monsters or don\u2019t have them. My parents always cleaned after me.", "That\u2019s why she said she would\u2019ve moped after. But the parent should At least pick up the vomit with proper towel. You parents are so damn selfish and entitled, and get mad when people don\u2019t treat you like royalty. Thank god we are becoming smarter and holding y\u2019all accountable.", "Boo hoo. Get over yourself.  Being \"embarrassed\" that your kid vomited isn't an excuse to just walk away from his/her vomit. That's your responsibility. \n\nIf you don't \"have the equipment at the ready, \" use your big boy words and ASK. \n\nI swear, parents act like they are so incapable of doing anything once they have kids.", ">\"where's a mop? let me help\" but unfortunately they're not obligated to do that.\n\nAnd an employee with an iota of compassion would say \"don't worry about it, take care of your kid and I'll get this cleaned up\".", "Kids are the parents responsibility.", "Lmao you must be one of those people who should never have kids.", "Someone else mentioned this and they\u2019re right. Vomit is 100% within the realm of biohazard and should not be taken lightly. Unless your staff is properly trained to deal with biohazard cleanup it is not their responsibility. Also that parent is an asshole.", "Yep. I'm in lower management and I have to give the safety huddle talks, we had one on biohazard cleanup, and I straight up told them that it *doesn't apply to them just come get a manager*\n\nFrankly, $16.50 an hour isn't really enough for me to clean up puke either, but they *definitely* shouldn't be doing it for 12 bucks an hour", "Exactly!! It's literally in the food handlers training that biohazards are to be cleaned by professionals or management. I pull that card every single time some plastered guest can't handle their stomach. Some of my coworkers help out and I try to tell them they're not obligated to, but they do it anyway.\n\n This Saturday one of my guests had a seizure before his food arrived and ended up passing out twice, once next to his seat and once in the doorway. Apparently he puked 3 times on his way out, one of the managers flagged me down to point it out, and I just nodded and kept serving. Like, I'm busier than you anyway, making drinks, running food and serving 10 parties, why don't you do it?", "NTA , minimum wage jobs really be expecting people to be slaves or something", "It obviously is, but if a food handler is physically sick themselves, they aren't allowed to work until 48 hrs after incident, but they can clean sick and go back to work.... there is no logic there, its not ok to expect a person earning minimum wage to clean up a child's puke", "Can\u2019t you call the police for biohazard stuff? (Don\u2019t downvote me I\u2019m asking and curious)", "Or say they are not fine all the time and then one time they are *actually* really really not fine. Learned that one the hard way.", "As a parent of a kid that threw up from time to time, you know what your worried about when your kid throws up in public? Your sick kid. You need to get that kid taken care of and settled before you can do anything else. That usually means getting the kid home as soon as possible because who knows what's next. Could be more puking. Could be a meltdown. Whatever.\n\n\n\n\nI get why everyone who says a parent should clean up. I do. And I feel bad for the people that have had to clean it up, but that's life. I used to install flooring. At times, that meant moving people's furniture and ripping out their old floors. The shit I should not have had to deal with, but did any ways, was out of this world disgusting. The dog piss and shit was too much. But it was part of the job. Moving peoples dirty underwear... and the shit you find under beds. It is what it is. So maybe, that's why I feel like it's an establishments job to clean up any mess made there. They have the tools and familiarity with the establishment. Like I said, I do feel bad. I know it is a shit situation that nobody wants to deal with.\n\n\n\n\nHell, my son threw up at the movie theater at the beginning of the movie. When I told the manager, he asked me to stand by for a few minutes, and he came back with vouchers so we could come back. He said, I've got it from here. Have a nice day.\n\n\n\n\nI feel bad about that one because the theater was crowded. Everyone behind us saw and were reacting with some bit of horror. The people in front of us were oblivious. Though if it weren't for me reacting quickly, they would have found out the *hard* hard way. Instead, they probably sat there wondering why it smelled so much like puke. As for me... my entire left side was covered and it was pooled in my shoe.\n\n\nThen I got to stand in the parking lot broad daylight wearing nothing but my boxer briefs arguing with my 8 year-old son over him stripping down before he gets in. I would pay to see video of mostly naked me being very animated while yelling at my son in the regal cinema parking lot. I was shouting and gesturing wildly in the direction of home telling him to walk that way and I'll see him when he gets there. \n\n\nMind you, I have big man boobs that have been the bane of my existence since elementary school. I don't take my shirt off in front of others except my immediate family. So, standing out there with without a shirt really raised my anxiety which was already though the roof because I do not deal well with vomit because i got thrown up on twice in elementary school. I can do poop and blood, but vomit brings out the worst in me.\n\n\n\nAs for why he threw up... he has a super weak gag reflex. So, any hint of an upset stomach... even form over eating or drinking too much milk... and it is all coming back up. Hell, the dentist told us to not let him eat the day of his appointments because he 100 percent was throwing up there. As someone that low key freaks out over puke, it was a real nightmare raising that kid sometimes. \n\n\n\n\nAnyways, if you read all of that, you're a champ. If not, well I guess you're not seeing this.", "She isn\u2019t asking who\u2019s the responsible one, she\u2019s asking if she\u2019s the a-hole.

They have the proper equipment at the ready because it happens so often. Coffee shop staff aren't expected to clean up vomit in their daily expected tasks.

This is how we get bar staff who have to put up with men making disgusting comments on their bodies. This is how we get women in *any* working environment having to 'do as they're told' and let the abuse happen just so they can earn enough for rent and food.\n\nSomeone's job, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or anything else, is to do what falls under their responsibilities based on their contract.

Not surprised", "Yeah. \"New Fox\" sounds about right.", "my point was that i wouldn\u2019t clean up someone else\u2019s puke for them (besides mopping obviously) its not apart of my job description and if i work minimum wage your getting the bare minimum", "Saying that someone has to do as they are told at work leads to this kind of thing.
