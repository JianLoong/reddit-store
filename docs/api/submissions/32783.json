With luck, the kid probably puked on him on the way home. I'd ban a customer for that.", "NTA and what is wrong with him? Parents are responsible for everything their kids do until they're old enough.

There's plenty of poor management out there.  Which also makes me angry. \n\nAlso cleaning up vomit is the worst.

You should\u2019ve already been trained on how to deal with anything that\u2019s a potential bio-hazard, including various types of body fluids.

If you look around your workplace and no one else is the janitor, that person just might be you!\n\nIt\u2019s not about who\u2019s responsible for the child, the question is who\u2019s responsible for keeping your workplace clean and safe for other customers & employees.

To get other people sick? Idiot!", "NTA but I bet if you check your job description it is on there in some way.

If the parent won't do it, that's the manager's problem.", "NTA I work in a jewelry store and the same kind of thing happened the kid wet themselves all over the floor and the mother just watched us clean it up.

It's shit but hey, it ends up being one of the 'really fun work stories you share and laugh at in the future.", "ESH.  Isn't part of onboarding OSHA videos and training to clean biohazards?  Honestly depending on what the dad was wrestling with, and the sheer embarrassment of having his kid puke in a public space, you could have a little sympathy.  My kid threw up at the table in a restaurant as a toddler.  I tried to clean it up but didn't have the equipment at the ready.\n\nFurthermore, my 17 year old son works for a grocery store chain.  If he has to clean up hazards, they provide him with PPE to clean it up.", "First job?", "NTA but as others have stated, this comes with the territory when you work in customer service and you are charged with maintaining an area where things will inevitably get spilled and people will inevitably get sick. You had access to the cleaning supplies and they did not. As you spend more time in food service and customer service, you will likely have to unfuck situations far more inconsiderate and gross than this.", "I'll be honest. I've had points where I have asked, apologetically, for people to clean up after my kids has puked. But that is because the kids is crying, and I'm dropping whatever I had planned to take them home, put them in clean clothes and comfort them. But from the sound of it, he just stood there. \n\nI'm going to leave a judgement off. I don't know what to put.", "Also having a bit of understanding would be really beneficial in this situation.
