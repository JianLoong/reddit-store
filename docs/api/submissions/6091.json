I am saying that no-one should get a free pass, even though OPs friends said he was in the wrong for reporting it.", "> not thinking it would be a problem\n\nReally, though? She obviously knew they'd be enough of a stink that she didn't want them in her living space. And she clearly thought it was okay to move her stink and inflict it on others rather than experience it herself. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, and honestly I don't think the building manager is, either. That level of inconsiderateness is not something I'd want in a tenant, not to mention the expensive biohazard they created.", "Would you know if she has strikes from other incidents? This could be a third strike.", "Even if you think the landlord's reaction was extreme (eviction on the spot doesn't exist where i live, so it seems extreme to me), OP did nothing wrong with reporting it. Even though she didn't turn out to be the next Dahmer she created a hazardous situation.", "It's possible but unlikely. She only moved in like 3-4 weeks ago (I think). But I mean.. She could have?", "I would ask her for compensation. Because they\u2019re probably ruined. \n\nDo you have insurance?", "See if you can find an ozone cleaner to rent.

The sun starts rising a bit before 9 am and 4 in the afternoon it\u2019s almost completely dark. And here in the southern part of the country, when it isn\u2019t snowing, it\u2019s most likely raining, so the air is both cold and pretty humid as well. Definitely not ideal for drying anything.

You might need a pint, but it will probably get the smell out.", "I have home owners insurance, I'll have to call them on monday!", "Sunlight is really good for breaking down odor-causing compounds. If the other excellent suggestions here aren\u2019t working, try putting the stuff in full sun for several days when it gets warmer.  Definitely try sunlight before going through the hassle of stripping and refinishing your furniture.", "You might want to edit the OP, it really makes it sound like neighbor was kicked out on the spot.

I needed some recently and I thought it wasn't nearly as effective as I remembered it being.", "I just did some searching.

The original formula was put on sale again as \"Petastic.\" However, they eventually merged Petastic into their other line of nature-friendly cleaning products. It's called \"ECOS for pets\" now.

Also, even if you knew she would be back that night, judging by the responses of other people who know what kind of havoc rotting prawns can wreak on a residence, the smell at that point would have been so awful and difficult to remove that she wouldn't have been able to rectify the situation on her own anyway.\n\nSo I think contacting the landlord was your only reasonable course of action. \n\nAnd you are certainly not responsible for the eviction notice.\n\nNTA.", "You are NTA because you had no idea what would happen nor what caused the smell.

I would have done the same.", "NTA, you warned the landlord because there was a smell as if someone had died. You couldn't reach the person responsible for that space. Ofcourse you call either the landlord or the police. It is not on you that she had something foul in there and that the landlord immediately enacted the most severe consequences.", "NTA. You thought there was a dead person!! What else were you supposed to do?", "NTA.  She left something disgusting and smelly, and caused her own eviction.", "NTA. You asked about the smell and they felt with it.

There is no way she would win in the US.", "Yes -- it was responsible and sensible to involve the landlord.  What if the person had fallen and passed away in the unit, what if there was an animal trapped in there somehow ...

If you fully read the OP stated in a separate storage unit... And shrimp tails are commonly used in the Philippines as a plant fertilizer.

Nope, and now you're in trouble with the landlord. I'm sure her parents would be furious with her, too. Lesson learned!", "Okay, you might be right about that, even if OP talking about \"apartments\" makes me think more of a storage unit located directly in the same building, perhaps under the apartments like a car box, instead of a separate construction entirely", ">I guess living out on a farm with a bone pit has shifted my views on what to classify a biohazard.\n\nMaybe it has, so let me explain it to you: what's dangerous and harmful in the countryside, where stuff can be left or dumped to compost and disperse natually, is very different from what's dangerous in a concrete cage that will trap rotting food and all that follows inside of it until removal.", "Oh gotcha, then I\u2019m the one who misread your reply, my bad! Yeah exactly, though. \n\nOne of my core memories from high school was when a friend said that their neighbor in their apartment building kept the body of their dead spouse, who they\u2019d murdered, on an over-door coat hanger until they were caught, cause ofc the rancid smell.", "Actually, both statements are true, kinda. Most people view the day you leave the day that you are evicted.

Goodluck!", "Ozone generators (you would put them in a sealed area that can be easily aired out after, like a plastic tote) are FANTASTIC for removing odor because they kill odor causing bacteria - the hunting community has used them for years now to remove odor from their clothing - a friend of my in-laws who hunts tipped us to it and it has worked fantastic. Fun fact - You can also rescue books from mold and odor this way - it kills pretty much anything. You can also get laundry detergent that eliminates bio-odors that is marketed towards hunters that works well.", "This might be a country/translation thing because in America an eviction is when you are forcibly removed from your residence.
