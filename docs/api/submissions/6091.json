Anything that followed is down to her and the landlord.", "That is absolutely disgusting, and feral. What was she thinking? You 100% didn't overreact by informing the landlord, that is a safety hazard. Can you imagine what type of bacteria and insects would be attracted to do that. Oh and the maggots. \n\nNTA, All day!", "NTA. The smell had to be dealt with and you did what you could to fix it. Yes, it's a bit shit that they were evicted because of it and you can be sad/sorry about that, but you had no intent that that would happen.", "NTA. One cannot live in a building with other people and disturb them with extreme bad smells. How bad was it that you thought someone was dying", "NTA. At all. The smell was going to just get worse and cause more issues if it wasn't reported by you.\n\nYour neighbor just got an important lesson on properly disposing of trash.", "There's a story, possibly apocryphal, about a rejected wife putting a few prawns in a hollow curtain rail, before she was evicted by her ex husband and his new woman. They tore the house apart trying to find the source of the stink. Ended by them selling the house back to the ex wife at a huge discount, smug at the thought of her living amid the terrible smeech.\n\nIf that's the kind of drama that a couple of prawns could cause, just think how bad 10lbs of the buggers would be. NTA", "NTA it could have been a dead body you are right, just as it wasn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you are in the wrong, leaving that amount of dead prawn shells in a storage unit is a serious health hazard and it\u2019s not wrong for her to have been evicted because of it", "NTA\n\nThat must have smelled awful. But you weren't trying to get her evicted, you were concerned about the smell.  If you didn't complain, someone else would have and she might have had an extra day or so, but it would have been found out.  \n\nShe got herself into trouble there, not you.  You're not responsible for her other two strikes. You're not even responsible for the third.  You didn't put that in her stuff.  She did.", "She was trying to dry the prawn shells for stock or powder. Its pretty common in south east asian cuisine. The shells do stink and attracts flies if let out in the open to dry. A better option would be to deep fry the shells.", "NTA. Why would she leave prawn shells in a storage  unit. The smell would be horrendous. You didn't intend for her to get evicted, so don't feel bad. You just wanted the awful smell gone.", "NTA, your response was reasonable and appropriate to the situation. But it\u2019s unclear here whether the real asshole is the tenant for keeping her space dirty/unsanitary, or the landlord for dismissing her without the usual three strikes. I\u2019m only saying that because hiding prawn shells in somebody\u2019s home is a fairly common (almost cliched) way of getting back at an ex or perpetuating domestic abuse by a current partner - so if she has a partner who has a grudge against her and a key to the unit this might not be the tenant\u2019s fault at all, and she might be scared to report whoever it was because she fears recriminations.", "NTA\n\nWhy would _anyone_ from _any_ culture think that leaving out 10lbs of rotting prawn shells is OK?", "NTA, unless you knew that could happen, and it does not sound like you did.", "NTA. Apparently there were much worse things going on inside her flat if they were able to circumvent the three strikes policy. Dying to know what they found. Or what she was planning on doing with 10lbs of rotten shrimp shells.", "NTA. Such stuff can lead to rat and roach infestations. Honestly, who would store prawn shells in a warm storage unit?!", "NTA. You didn't cause this. The woman who left open peawn shells to rot was the problem.", "I\u2019m ready for my downvotes, but as someone who isn\u2019t white, I do not understand the whole idea of giving free passes to non-white people, no questions asked, even if they literally STINK UP AN ENTIRE APARTMENT BUILDING WITH HOARDED ROTTEN PRAWN SHELLS.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t OP who rang the alarm bells, it would\u2019ve been someone else, and the result would\u2019ve been the same.

That was a health hazard to everyone.", "NTA - everyone in the building needed this addressed", "NTA it was never your intention to evict her. That was the decision of the landlord. All you wanted was the small of death to not be in your living space. That is reasonable. Also I\u2019m US \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 and totally jealous of your eviction laws. It can take month or years here depending on the case. Lol.", "I think you are NTA. Are you supposed to live with a terrible stench? Why would anyone do something like this? How could you not know it was going to stink to high heaven in a very short time. Where she is from has nothing to do with it. Its the behavior that caused her to get evicted.", "INFO: did this all happen in one day or did you try to find the odor over multiple days? If you knew she wasn\u2019t home and so there wasn\u2019t a body why not wait til they can come home so someone can talk to her first before escalating?\n\nFrom what I see here I think ESH cuz leaving rotting prawns is gross and inconsiderate. That being said it sucks you didn\u2019t try to resolve it without intervention first especially this time of year.", "Must\u00b4ve been more to it.Either she was renting from someone other than the landlord or the landlord commited a crime by evicting her.It is against the law here to evict on the spot, but since she isnt from here she probably isnt aware of the laws either. If she just stays put keeps paying the rent and appeal the eviction she probably wont be evicted.\n\nEdit: NTA. In my mind you did the right thing, the landlord seems fishy though.", "Correct. The landlord\u2019s reaction could not have been predicted and the odor needed to be dealt with.\n\nI would love to know what she was saving them for!", "I assume those points are why they said that they will need to sanitize the area.", "A while back a friend took her car to the dealer because after searching all over she couldn\u2019t get rid of a horrible smell. At first it was a assumed something had crawled under the hood or another enclosed space and died.  They couldn\u2019t find anything in the usual paces.\n\nEventually someone checked under the driver\u2019s seat. Apparently some leftover fish in a takeout container was put on the floor in the backseat, forgotten about and slid under the driver\u2019s seat. All that stink was from forgotten fish!", "Is that a book or an actual event? That's an incredible level of petty haha.", "Oh so it *is* a thing? I had no idea!", "She lives alone, is new to the country and AFAIK she admitted to her putting them there herself, not thinking it would be a problem.", "I don't think it has anything to do with culture.", "She gets to live there for 3 more months but then she's out of there.", "3 months minimum here as well!", "I mean....what if it was a body? They honestly couldn't know what the smell was without entering the storage area. They could assume the woman wasn't home...they could know she left and assume she didn't let a friend stay to watch her place. But without entering the area of the smell toverify the smell they could only assume it wasn't the one person.", "One day. There was a smell the day before as well, but nowhere near as extreme. \n\nWe didn't know that she would be home that day. And the smell was unbearable. I'm staying with friends today and did so last night as well because it's not possible to be in the building. So waiting several days wouldn't have been possible with that smell.", "No, it's perfectly legal to evict her. It has haooened before. She gets 3 months as does everyone else.", "I assumed she would get a strike. The only other time someone was evicted from here without 3 strikes was someone who shot fireworks against the building and managed to shoot one straight into someones living room. \n\nSo I assumed she would get a reprimand.", "The smell of rotting prawn is extremely hard to remove. It almost has to be doneby professionals who specialize in the removal of dead body orders.", "I've been to hotels that 400 quid just for smoking. Can you imagine what type of sanitization they would need. Also, 5 years ago this month I was in Stockholm! :)", "I think that it was an urban myth doing the rounds. I've heard it several times, varying in the number of prawns, the cunning hiding places and the look on the ex husband's face. Petty well deserved. Tee hee.", "Ok, then she is failing to grasp basic common sense to the degree that she\u2019s being an asshole to the rest of you by making you live with the consequences of her actions; but the landlord also somewhat overreacted if it seems like she would have taken the criticism on board and mended her ways in future.\n\nI used to live in a block where a lot of the flats were let to mature students in the 20-25 age range and a surprising number of them seemed to think that if they left rubbish or household waste in the hallways or on the floor in front of the bins, the trash fairy would make it all go away.\n\nOn one occasion I blocked a girl from leaving the bin store and told her to ring her parents so I could ask them to come over and finish raising her after she said she wouldn\u2019t put her rubbish into the dumpster in the bin store because she didn\u2019t want to touch the \u201cdirty\u201d dumpster lid. The alternative I offered was that I follow her to her flat to get her door number*, and then write to her landlord and the management company to make sure she paid the fine for littering herself rather than it being split between the homeowners of all the flats. That latter option was enough to decide her that it might be a good idea to lift the lid and put her rubbish inside the bin; but I never saw problems from her again.\n\n*for context, I was an average-height skinny woman about 5-10 years older than this girl at the time and shorter than her, she was accompanied by two non-resident friends, and I had my arm in a sling so she was not physically threatened in any way by this!", "Well yes and no. \n\nYou didnt state that it had happend before.  \nIt might be legal to evict her, but it can also be legal for her to stay.   \nIts a tricky part of the legal system.  \nThe right of possession is one of the strongest rights you have in Sweden. If she fights it she can stay for years tbh.", "She is responsible for her own actions.  It was her mistake, not yours.", "I am Swedish, I was born here and I live here. And there\u2019s NO WAY they would have been able to evict her on the spot, especially if she was a first hand renter. Hyresg\u00e4stf\u00f6reningen are going to have a field day with this one if it\u2019s true. But yeah obviously you\u2019re NTA for notifying your hyresv\u00e4rd.", "Yeah I tried to Google it today and it seems that it will be pretty expensive for our landlords to fix this. \n\nI also have my storage unit right next to hers so I assume all my things are ruined?", "We\u2019re don\u2019t know of she has any other strikes do we?", "That's just blatantly false. They can give her 3 months notice if rules as broken. It has happened her before, that time due to fireworks. Hyresg\u00e4stf\u00f6reningen can't do anything if rules are followed. A health hazard that requires a building to be sanitized is grounds for eviction.", "If you have soft goods try washing them in vinegar several times or if you have it there something called odo ban ( it's a brand name). If you have furniture try baking soda sprinkled over the furniture and let it sit, repeat 2 to 4 times. You may have to sand down and re-stain wood furniture after using a cleaner in them.  \n\nIf the smell lingers even after repeated attempts then they are a lost cause.", "So please clarify, was she given an eviction notice and will be evicted in 3 months? Did she get the notice 3 months ago and gets evicted today? Because your post makes it sound like she's gotten evicted on the spot and is now homeless.", "Mainly furniture, clothes and hockey equipment. So I'll do my best! Thanks for the tip! :)"]}
