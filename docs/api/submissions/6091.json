But it\u2019s unclear here whether the real asshole is the tenant for keeping her space dirty/unsanitary, or the landlord for dismissing her without the usual three strikes. I\u2019m only saying that because hiding prawn shells in somebody\u2019s home is a fairly common (almost cliched) way of getting back at an ex or perpetuating domestic abuse by a current partner - so if she has a partner who has a grudge against her and a key to the unit this might not be the tenant\u2019s fault at all, and she might be scared to report whoever it was because she fears recriminations.", "NTA\n\nWhy would _anyone_ from _any_ culture think that leaving out 10lbs of rotting prawn shells is OK?", "NTA, unless you knew that could happen, and it does not sound like you did.", "NTA.

The alternative I offered was that I follow her to her flat to get her door number*, and then write to her landlord and the management company to make sure she paid the fine for littering herself rather than it being split between the homeowners of all the flats. That latter option was enough to decide her that it might be a good idea to lift the lid and put her rubbish inside the bin; but I never saw problems from her again.\n\n*for context, I was an average-height skinny woman about 5-10 years older than this girl at the time and shorter than her, she was accompanied by two non-resident friends, and I had my arm in a sling so she was not physically threatened in any way by this!", "Well yes and no. \n\nYou didnt state that it had happend before.  \nIt might be legal to evict her, but it can also be legal for her to stay.   \nIts a tricky part of the legal system.  \nThe right of possession is one of the strongest rights you have in Sweden.

They can give her 3 months notice if rules as broken. It has happened her before, that time due to fireworks. Hyresg\u00e4stf\u00f6reningen can't do anything if rules are followed.

You all looked around appropriately, and called management  to handle it. Whatever the result of that is isn't on you or your neighbors. \n\nThink of it this way. You didn't go looking to evict anyone or to get anyone in trouble. You thought there was a dead body and I think all of us would like that investigated. Living in NYC, this is my nightmare-both as someone who doesn't want to be the dead body or the person who smells it- so I thank you for your service.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get her evicted, her own actions or lack thereof got her evicted. Anyone with common sense would know to dispose of prawn shells directly, especially 10 lbs. of it.

It seems like common sense that leaving any food in a non-temperature controlled storage unit for a long period of time would cause it to rot.

It\u2019s in violation of the lease agreement (and therefore cause for termination and eviction) to neglect the unit\u2019s cleaning to such an extent that either the property is damaged or an odor develops, because it violates another separate clause to do anything that would result in an odor strong enough to interfere with another tenant\u2019s peaceful enjoyment of the unit.
