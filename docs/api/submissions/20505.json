I told Amy I would rent with her this year at the start of the previous year and started dating my BF six months later. I wanted to live with my BF but had told Amy I would live with her and I don\u2019t break promises, so we all moved into a two bed flat with Amy paying a little more because she had a room to herself. We decided to split the chores when living together so Amy did the cleaning around the flat while me and my BF cooked dinner for all three of us every night. Amy paid a third of our food bill to keep it fair. Things went well at first but Amy has anxiety and it got frustrating when she skirted around like we were going to hit her. It felt like a vicious circle because she would act like we were mad at her and then we got mad at her for being irritating. \n\nA few things she did that annoyed us were: she wouldn\u2019t share snacks even though we shared dinner with her, she went out with her friends and didn\u2019t invite us, she tidied away our stuff, she would always leave if my BF and I were being flirty. \n\nI know communication is important so we would sit her down to talk about stuff like this but it didn\u2019t work. It all came to a head when she told us at work that her cousin (who is on antipsychotics for depression) was coming to visit for a week the next week. We acted professional but text her later to say we wanted to have a talk with her about her behaviour.  When we got home and sat her down, she said she was going to start cooking dinner for herself and her cousin but would keep cleaning the flat anyway, she said her cousin and her wouldn\u2019t come out of her room much, etc. etc.  Once she stopped, I told her that what she\u2019d done at work was completely unacceptable and we wouldn\u2019t be tolerating that in the future I then told her we wouldn\u2019t be allowing her cousin to visit because of her mental health problems - we didn\u2019t feel comfortable with someone like that visiting our home.  She was so angry that we\u2019d brought her cousin\u2019s mental health into things and accused us of using that as an excuse because we \u201chated her\u201d. She started flinging accusations at us, saying things like we never give her a fair share of the food, saying we treat her like a maid and that we\u2019re inappropriate in the communal spaces. \n\nEventually she asked why we hated her and I told her all the problems we had. Like, this is a girl that we absolutely welcomed into our lives and she couldn\u2019t even be big enough to apologise for acting like a greedy child. Anyway, my BF and I were going away on holiday for 5 days the next day but when we got back to the flat, it was spotless with all of her stuff gone and her rent payments were cancelled. A few of our mutual work friends helped her move out the day after we left and now I feel like we are being judged by everyone at work over not letting her cousin stay.", "created_utc": 1687653744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i8dyi/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_flatmates_mentally/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Small breakdown : \n- You permanently added someone to your previously established living arrangement with Amy but she can\u2019t have someone over for a week. \n- You seem to blame her for totally normal things. The snack thing is a bit weird but it sounds like she is actually doing you a favor by giving you some privacy when you\u2019re flirtatious or cleaning up after you. \n- You demonize people with depression.", "YTA. Millions of people are on meds for depression. You act like he's this violent serial killer. Also, nothing she did was that bad. She doesn't have to invite you out with her friends. She cleaned up your mess, oh no. She doesn't want to hang around while you and your bf jump each other. The only sliiiightly egregious thing she does is not share snacks when you cook food lol. There was no inappropriate behavior to talk to her about. You sound awful to live with", "YTA - Literally everything you wrote just makes you more and more TA.  This is so obviously your bad I suspect this is a troll post.  At least I hope it is.  Otherwise.... \n\nAlso, you had a truly awesome roommate who you managed to trick into paying more than half the rent instead of splitting the rent in thirds (per person) or half (per room) as would be standard.  Unless you wanted to run her off so you two could live without a roommate...you made a big mistake.  No one else is going to put up with you.", "YTA a million times. \n\nYou get annoyed because she goes out with her friends, you get annoyed because she gives you privacy when you're flirting in the communal areas, you get annoyed when she tidies up. and then you refuse to let her cousin visit because she has depression. And you refer to her cousin as \"someone like that.\" You are awful people and she's better off without you.", "YTA. I\u2019m happy for Amy. It\u2019s blowing my mind you thought y\u2019all were in the right", "YTA.\n\nYou treated your friend like she was Cinderella. Im glad she moved out, she finally came to her senses.

It's not like you will infect with it. Most people you won't even notice they have depression. But you will learn that much people will be rude to you only because of an illness. Experiences like that will make it harder, every time again.

Split that shit three ways to start with.  She is not your child so stop treating her like one.  She pays rent and is allowed to have anyone over that she wants.

This is some Cinderella shit. She cleans the whole flat despite being 1/3 of the mess, has to deal with your PDA, has to share all her food because you share one meal, and can\u2019t have a guest that she cares about stay with her. What benefits did she have by living with you, other than reduced rent? Yikes.\n\nAlso your workmates are judging you for being crap people, not just because you didn\u2019t let her cousin stay.", "YTA, why are you making it seem like you're doing her a favor by her living there with you? You all moved in together, you and your partner aren't the owners or anything. You have no right to decide who can visit her in her room. Also why would she want to invite you out all the time? She probably wants a break from the couple she is around literally all of the time, also dinner is a completely different thing to snacks. When I used to flat, we would share dinner, but all have our own separate snacks.", "It\u2019s funny that everyone has told you that you are an asshole and you\u2019re still convinced you aren\u2019t.

You're her flatmate lol not her friend, I never invited my flatmates out and vice versa. Then your complete meltdown over her cousin as if he was Jack the ripper, for someone who claims you're a doctor you sure as shit don't seem to understand mental illness lol kudos to your flatmate for getting the fuck away from you two, you both sound so incredibly petty and self absorbed.", "You are not a doctor, or you would know more about antipsychotic medication. Your roommate did nothing wrong. If she was already chipping in for food you cooked, why should she share her personal snacks? Anxiety and mental health exist, get over it. You are more harmful than anyone else mentioned here. YTA", "YTA, I am glad Amy moved out. You sound like an entitled, controlling nightmare to live with.", "Amy pays more because she has a room to herself? You should be paying more because there are two of you!! \n\nYou sound like hard work and very judgemental. She was paying for her share of the food you were cooking each night. One of her chores was cleaning but you didn\u2019t like it when she tidied your stuff. She doesn\u2019t owe you social events outside of the home. I think your account is very one sided. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. I don\u2019t blame her for moving out. Why does she pay \u201ca little more\u201d for having her own room?

Your boyfriend promised to make dinner every night. Cool. Your flatmate didn\u2019t promise to share her food with you. She is allowed to have her own friends and do her own thing. It\u2019s actually creepy that you expected to be invited along every time. She tidied your stuff \u2014 as in, she went into your private, personal spaces and rearranged things, or she cleaned up after stuff you left out in communal areas? One is an overstep, the other means you need to do a better job picking up after yourself. NO ONE WANTS TO BE AROUND COUPLES FLIRTING OR ENGAGED IN PDA. \n\nI\u2019m happy for Amy getting out.

So maybe take the hint OP. You\u2019re the problem.", "YTA. \n\nWhy aren\u2019t you splitting the rent by thirds? That would make the most sense. And why do you and your boyfriend do all the cooking (splitting that task between you) but Amy does 100% of the cleaning? And why is Amy paying 1/3 of the food bill when most likely your boyfriend eats more than she does? Funny how when the bill splitting is advantageous to you, it\u2019s fair, but Amy has to pay more for her room because \u201cshe gets it to herself.\u201d WTF? That makes zero sense. \n\nYou and your boyfriend are acting like she\u2019s not a paying tenant on the lease, which she absolutely is. The cousin is a guest coming to stay for a week in Amy\u2019s room, which she\u2019s absolutely allowed to have. \n\nStart ponying up 2/3 of the rent for starters and stop policing who can come to your house or get irritated because Amy might find your love sessions on the couch uncomfortable and decide to leave you two alone.

Also taking meds for depression does not mean that person is a danger to themselves and others. Educate yourself and do better.", "YTA in a number of ways!!! She pays more rent even though there are two of you. She's required to clean the entire flat by herself bc you guys make dinner, which she pays her share for. You said you \"welcomed her into your lives\" even though you had been planning on living with her since before you even met your boyfriend. You're discriminating against someone for their mental health AND you're doctors??? Please, find a new profession. Why, for the love of god, would your flatmate know dosage info of her cousins meds??

She used to invite us to spend time with our friends but then started actively excluding us (these friends are also work colleagues). We made healthy vegan meals for dinner every night and she would hide non-vegan snacks in her room even though we were trying to be a vegan household and her aunt sent her some vegan snacks once that she removed from the kitchen and to her room after my bf ate one - she always did pointed things like that or overreacted to stuff to make us seem like the bad guys (like we told her we didn\u2019t like her gaming in the living room when we were cooking and the next day she moved her console to her room and was like there no issue! like super passive aggressive)", "You have to wonder if the goal was to get her to move out and now they want to feel better about it by asking Reddit.", "She actually pays *more* than a third of the rent!", "The money situation was fair though?

Amy refused to tell us  why her cousin was on antipsychotics (she would just say she had severe depression and it was a dark time for them before her cousin got on meds and wouldn\u2019t explain further) but if they do have a history of psychosis then we deserve to know if they\u2019re coming to live with us, just for safety\u2019s sake like if they hallucinated or lashed out.", "I was wondering this as well.

Example: a lot of antidepressants are prescribed for migraines. I know this because I have taken everything under the sun to attempt to control my migraines. Also, if you were a competent medical practitioner, you would know and understand the concept of patient privacy. As it stands, you are either incompetent or not a doctor.\n\nYTA. For so many reasons. But the top ones: \n\n1) you agreed to room with 'Amy' and lived with her for six months before you met the boyfriend. She didn't sign up for that. \n\n2) You both sound like you were miserable to live with. Nothing you listed that she was supposedly guilty of, earned your control freak response. \n\n3) You are an AH for being nosy about her cousin.

There wasn't one part of your post that referred to you and your bf as separate entities which makes me believe you're a relationship chameleon. You become \"one\" with your partner thus making the relationship and that person your whole identity. You resent having to share any part of this person and your relationship with her and ended up bullying her into leaving when one slightly awkward conversation before signing a lease would've saved you all so much.

I can't even get started on the cousin situation because it's so disgusting, particularly for someone who claims to be a doctor (I'm assuming that's in the same way that Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz are doctors). A medication is NOT a diagnosis. Several prescriptions can treat numerous things on all different levels. Wellbutrin can be a mood stabilizer for some as well as help others to quit smoking. Someone who has genital herpes and someone who gets cold sores would both be prescribed Valtrex but their conditions and the severity are not at all the same.
