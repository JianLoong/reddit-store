Maybe you should find out, so you can do what is best for your child. \n\nNTA.", "Nta- the terms of his visa are to be a parent to your son. He isn't being a parent to your son- and your son always has to come first. Money and a regular routine visitation schedule will do wonders for your kid. You've tried to get these things without the courts. I don't know what choice you have.", "NTA. Your son love his dad cuz he\u2019s an anomaly. He\u2019s an event. Not cuz he\u2019s his dad. If he gets deported for failing to be a *regular* part of your sons life, so be it.", "I mean, NTA, but one day the child will grow up and learn about it. They might think YTA.", "you said money isn\u2019t a problem so why would you try to put him on child support and potentially get him deported so his son wouldn\u2019t even be able to see him anymore", "I completely understand your position. Is your goal to get him to support you get him more contact with your son or both? If you report him what if he gets deported? If you were together would you do that? If your goal is to get him to pay more, and he gets deported, will he pay? \nDad won\u2019t always be the same. Children need their dad too. He cares, he is show up. Not as much as you would like. But he is around. He might improve but many times one parent isn\u2019t behaving the way the other parent wishes. \nWhat is the best choice for your son? \nI will not give any opinion on the question. Remember, you and dad created this boy together. Both of you made the decision. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t planned but nevertheless he is here and deserves the very best possible life. \nBe well, take a breath, talk to people who care about your son objectively. \nAll the best", "INFO\n\nWhat makes you think he is on a parent visa? Usually those kinds of visas need to be entered along with the mother providing DNA evidence. He also most likely wouldn't be able to work legally under such a visa.\n\nRegardless, you're  well within your right to fight for what's best for your child.\n\nI think it's best to inform yourself on his actual immigrant status before proceeding. Best of luck.", "I can see why you would do so but maybe confront your ex first answer give him 2 choices pay the money or you have to go thru legal channels to pursue payment and that you don't know how it will affect his visa.", "Warn him beforehand. Give him the opportunity to do the right thing. At the end of the day your child needs his father; so if you can prevent it while getting the support you deserve the better.\n\nIf he doesn't shape up then, your child deserves the support money as well. It's his legal right and it would not make you an asshole if you pursued it.", "He doesn\u2019t have a kid, he has a le anchor baby. \nGet his ass tossed.\n\nETA: YWNBTA", "It seems kinda screwed up to have someone fully *deported* just for being a shitty dad.\n\nDeportation is no joke. And frankly feels pretty weird to go to as a sort of revenge maneuver.\n\nJust seems weird to tattle. He may be an ass but idk, don\u2019t report him to the government about it *that* way is my feeling.\n\nI think YWBTA if you got him deported.\n\nAnd let be clear, I don\u2019t support the dad acting this way, but I don\u2019t support deportation as a thing that exists in this world either.", "I would figure out about how much you\u2019d likely get & tell him he can either pay that amount or you\u2019ll be filing. Make it clear the first time he misses a payment, you will file.", "NTA. I'd say he'd have to be at least a somewhat responsible parent to be eligible for a parent visa. However for me the question would be, what happens if he gets deported? Does he have something to fall back on in his home country, or would it be massively scr*wing him over?\nAnd that's even apart from the taking the (beloved) dad away from his child. The moral implications, not to mention future backlash on that are humongous.\n\nTry to find a middle way (sorry, don't know the English term). Good luck!~", "Are you prepared to be an \"only parent\" (as opposed to a single parent) if he is deported?     This includes the consequences to your son.\nMaybe the threat alone would make him step up?", "Ask a legal expert to confirm.  Last thing you want is him to get deported and you get nothing.  You are NTA", "The thing is, he\u2019s not being a parent.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing as if an unemployed person was in-country on a work visa. \n\nNTA", "My answer depends on which country he\u2019d be deported to. If it\u2019s an unsafe, under developed, or war torn country, it would be unethical to try to get him deported. Also, if he is deported you\u2019ll get less than you\u2019re getting now, and your son will no longer have a father. It\u2019s a shitty situation and he should absolutely be stepping up to the plate, but getting him deported is potentially crossing a line into unethical.", "NTA, you do what you have to do for your baby. You aren't the one making decision about being a dead beat parent. You aren't the one making the decision whether he will get visa or not.", "Dad means a lot to son. Son doesn\u2019t mean a lot to dad. Cut the cord while he\u2019s still young.", "If you are concerned about getting him deported, you might want to lay it on the line, in a safe place, that you will take action to get support from him, and he'll have to deal with the consequences.", ">If I were a child and I found out one parent got my other, non-abusive parent deported \n\nNeglect is a form of abuse, so OP's ex fails that criteria.", "The thing the Home Office is likely to prefer is to not deport your son\u2019s father, but rather get him paying regular child support.  Moving to deport him takes a lot more time and resources, whereas letting him stay, contingent on paying, is best for you and your son.\n\nSo, report him immediately and get things moving.  Your son deserves the support.  Good luck!", "There is no moral dilemma here.  As your son\u2019s mother and custodial parent you have to act in your son\u2019s best interest.  That is clearly pursuing financial support from the sperm donor.  You\u2019re overthinking this!", "Don\u2019t reward bad behavior!  Report the deadbeat.", "I love how you said that with your whole chest, like you know what's in OP's bank.", "It depends on when he slipped out.
