I have a few tables set up in the back so people can come in and play games, along with a small 'kitchen' (really just a fridge, microwave, sink and cupboard) so people can have some snacks and drinks while playing.\n\nOne of the regular groups have been playing DnD in my store on a weekly basis for the past three years (and I've sometimes joined them as a guest player), and it's always been great fun. About a year ago they had to find a new DM because their usual DM didn't have the time to dedicate to preparing campaigns anymore. While they were looking they still came in weekly, but just played regular boardgames instead. \n\nNow a few months ago this 10-year old girl (let's just call her Emma for convenience) showed up with her mother at one of the game nights. According to her mother, Emma had been spending months making all kinds of materials for playing DnD, but didn't know anyone who would play with her. So her mother wondered if it was okay for her to ask at my store if anyone would be willing to play.\n\nThe regular group was more than happy to join in for a session, and it ended up going so well they asked Emma to DM for them regularly if she wanted to. Fast forward to now and Emma is DMing two days a week, one time for the regular group and one time for one-off sessions for other people to jump in if they want. I swear this girl is a genius, she has memorised the entire player's handbook and monster guide, and made a fully homebrew campaign that's genuinely fun and exciting (though sometimes also surprisingly dark).\n\nNow for the problem. A few other people have started complaining about there being a child on game nights, saying the reason they're playing here is because they have children at home. Now that Emma is also coming to the game nights, they feel like they can't play games as they usually do because they keep having to think about whether their language or jokes are inappropriate for the presence of a child. \n\nI told them that I never said anything about providing a childfree space, so I won't be banning Emma from coming, so I'm sorry if they don't like it. But they're welcome to plan their nights on days where Emma isn't there, or find a different place to play. I did tell Emma's mother that Emma is only allowed to be here as long as one of her parents is also present (not going to take any risk).\n\nAITA for not banning children from game nights and telling people to basically suck it up?", "created_utc": 1699521604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17r95d8/aita_for_not_making_board_game_nights_in_my_store/", "score": 392, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do her parents actually mind if the adults have a beer or swear in front of her? \n\nNTA", "A group of seasoned players invited Emma to be their regular DM - that indicates she\u2019s not just faffing around waiting for Mom/Dad to finish, she\u2019s invested and passionate. The people complaining can kick rocks - nurturing the younger generation\u2019s love for board gaming is more valuable than \u2018getting away from kids\u2019 for a night!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Frankly, it sounds as if Emma as DM is more of an asset to your store than the people complaining about her - I bet you get people coming in to see if she\u2019s as good as they\u2019ve heard. She enjoys it, a parent is present, I really don\u2019t see a downside to her presence. That some people want to avoid children entirely says more about them. I bet their children would love to be included in games\u2026", "Emma sounds awesome. If it was my store, I\u2019d be favouring her over the complainers.\n\nWhich is easy for me to say. The complainers probably spend more money than Emma, though, so you might want to compromise.\n\nOne compromise could be running another games night that\u2019s child-free. Or you could encourage the complainers to DM their own game.", "Emma's passion for DnD and her talent for DMing is truly inspiring. As someone who has created an inclusive and welcoming space for board games and DnD, it's beautiful to see you embracing Emma's passion and encouraging her skills. It's clear that everyone is enjoying the experience, and it's wonderful that you're ensuring Emma's safety by requiring her parent's presence. You're doing the right thing by keeping the environment open and accepting for everyone, including Emma. It's essential for others to understand that this space isn't exclusively for adults, and being adaptable and considerate of everyone's enjoyment is key.", "NTA, it sounds like Emma is contributing a lot to creating a fun and positive atmosphere at your store. Not like the killjoys trying to escape from their own kids.", "NTA \n\nIf you want to allow kids, that's up to you. They are AHs because they actually expect you to 86 a different regular. You gave them options. They can take it or leave it.", "NTA, and this comes from someone who is fiercely in favour of adult only spaces and events.   \n\nIt\u2019s not like someone is bringing a screaming toddler, Emma wants to come and play D&D at a D&D night, so what\u2019s the issue?\n\nIf certain players want an adults only event, they should arrange one somewhere.", "NTA- As you stated it was never advertised as a child free event and she's not causing any problems so they can't expect you to ban her. They need to grow up and suck it up", "NTA. \nThey could try treating her like a regular human being.", "NTA this is really nice of you. People complain about kids being on their phone all day but the moment a child is actually part of a public space and dares to take up room, they are considered a nuisance by some. Whoever is bothered can come on other gamenights, it\u2019s not like Emma is there every single day. These adults are behaving like children", "NTA \nThanks for giving Emma a safe place to play and give her space to show her enthousiasm!", "NTA. You are not a bar, a casino, a sex club, a 21+ cruise nor any other place that excludes children; you\u2019re a GAMESTORE for gods sake. Have we turned the tables so much that now children get looking down on in setting which used to be geared toward them? The purpose of a game store is to provide everybody an outlet to love, learn, and play games. Not to turn into a frat kickback for drunk adults. If they want mostly drunkenly obscene convo with a little DnD, they can play at a bar. \n\nA campaign played at your store aka a public place **should** be more tame than one played in the intimacy of someone\u2019s home. Plenty of adults have difficulty with or aversion to certain subject matter and anybody playing in public should already be playing with a certain level of decorum. No obscenely graphic sex descriptions, no extremely intense violence, no SA etc. That\u2019s the standard. You can crank it to level 100 when you\u2019re in private, in a setting where everybody can agree to ground rules. That\u2019s just not the case at a game store, even if a child wasn\u2019t present. \n\nIf they are keeping in line with normal appropriate behavior when in public, then there\u2019s no problem for a 10 year old to be there. It\u2019s not like the parents have asked for people to not have any alcohol, abstain from violence, limit swearing, or in any way compromised the players free expression in the game beyond the limit that naturally occurs by being *in public*. If they refuse to play their game as they have been (which i\u2019m assuming was appropriate or that would be mentioned in the post) because they don\u2019t want to swear in front of a 10 year old, that\u2019s their choice. If they feel it ruins their game, still their choice. But Emma did nothing wrong and doesn\u2019t deserve it taken away from her.", "NAH\n\nI see both sides of this coin. Emma has the gaming capabilities to keep up with adults and she\u2019s found a good group to play with, which is awesome.\n\nI also understand that it can be really hard to have time away from your kids, that parents who want adult time out of the home aren\u2019t hateful criminals, and that they thought they\u2019d found that place at your store.\n\nIf you wanted to keep things as-is I wouldn\u2019t blame you but if there\u2019s a chance you can shift things around so that there\u2019s an adults-only night and an all-ages night that might keep everyone happy.", "NTA at all, your are being inclusive and allowing players to participate without excluding someone who is clearly enriching the experience for others based solely on her age. I wish I was local, I'd love to see her run s game. Good DMs are hard to find and it's a high burnout job. I ran games for years and spent at least 20 hours a week planning (and illustrating NPCs and locations, plus making \"aged maps\" for players to find.) It's kind of exhausting so the rule should be NEVER remove the DM unless they cross some serious boundaries.", "If there's \"a couple of tables\" they can find another game or dm and play games without her. I don't really see a problem - especially if her parents are fine with her in this interaction. \nDefinitely NTA", "NTA. I hate kids and even I think Emma sounds lovely and has as much right as anyone else to play a game she loves.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who hate their kids so much they\u2019re triggered by other kids when without them simply should not be having children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The problem I had was that I preferred dming an adult game with more mature themes and nuance but we ended up with several 13-15 year old boys in attendance that very much had a different playstyle and approach to the game.\n\nIt was my free time, that I volunteered to help run the night and I didn't enjoy (or want to DM) that kind of game.\n\nThe other issue was there parents had a habit of dropping them off and buggering off which ignoring the issue of leaving kids with a bunch of strange adults also caused the owner to be late closing up and missing his bus (rather than leave kids outside unattended in a town passed 10pm).\n\nIn the end we had to cancel the nights due to COVID and decided not to start it back up.", "Nta - the kid's done nothing wrong and puts effort into entertaining people.banning her would be a horrible life lesson - you can't do what you enjoy because adults can't moderate their behavior. Not to sound too Victorian but swearing and drinking in excess shouldn't be encouraged anyway. As a business owner, finding a niche that satisfies both parties is preferable but if someone says you should ban a paying customer of good conduct because *they* don't like them, that person is asking to take food off your table.

Even if her parents are fine with her being present to witness that behaviour I would not feel comfortable displaying that level of trash talk competitiveness in front of a child and I think there are a lot of gamers who will feel the same and that will probably result in the loss of customers.

It\u2019s great that this young lady is enjoying herself but having someone who is ten as DM, not even a teenager, interacting with random adults on topics which will be varied and come up week by week means increased risk to Emma and also makes the game night not great for some participants.
