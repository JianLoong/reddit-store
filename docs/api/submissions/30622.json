I have a few tables set up in the back so people can come in and play games, along with a small 'kitchen' (really just a fridge, microwave, sink and cupboard) so people can have some snacks and drinks while playing.\n\nOne of the regular groups have been playing DnD in my store on a weekly basis for the past three years (and I've sometimes joined them as a guest player), and it's always been great fun. About a year ago they had to find a new DM because their usual DM didn't have the time to dedicate to preparing campaigns anymore. While they were looking they still came in weekly, but just played regular boardgames instead. \n\nNow a few months ago this 10-year old girl (let's just call her Emma for convenience) showed up with her mother at one of the game nights. According to her mother, Emma had been spending months making all kinds of materials for playing DnD, but didn't know anyone who would play with her. So her mother wondered if it was okay for her to ask at my store if anyone would be willing to play.\n\nThe regular group was more than happy to join in for a session, and it ended up going so well they asked Emma to DM for them regularly if she wanted to. Fast forward to now and Emma is DMing two days a week, one time for the regular group and one time for one-off sessions for other people to jump in if they want. I swear this girl is a genius, she has memorised the entire player's handbook and monster guide, and made a fully homebrew campaign that's genuinely fun and exciting (though sometimes also surprisingly dark).\n\nNow for the problem. A few other people have started complaining about there being a child on game nights, saying the reason they're playing here is because they have children at home. Now that Emma is also coming to the game nights, they feel like they can't play games as they usually do because they keep having to think about whether their language or jokes are inappropriate for the presence of a child. \n\nI told them that I never said anything about providing a childfree space, so I won't be banning Emma from coming, so I'm sorry if they don't like it. But they're welcome to plan their nights on days where Emma isn't there, or find a different place to play. I did tell Emma's mother that Emma is only allowed to be here as long as one of her parents is also present (not going to take any risk).\n\nAITA for not banning children from game nights and telling people to basically suck it up?", "created_utc": 1699521604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17r95d8/aita_for_not_making_board_game_nights_in_my_store/", "score": 5066, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not a bar, a casino, a sex club, a 21+ cruise nor any other place that excludes children; you\u2019re a GAMESTORE for gods sake. Have we turned the tables so much that now children get looking down on in setting which used to be geared toward them? The purpose of a game store is to provide everybody an outlet to love, learn, and play games. Not to turn into a frat kickback for drunk adults. If they want mostly drunkenly obscene convo with a little DnD, they can play at a bar. \n\nA campaign played at your store aka a public place **should** be more tame than one played in the intimacy of someone\u2019s home. Plenty of adults have difficulty with or aversion to certain subject matter and anybody playing in public should already be playing with a certain level of decorum. No obscenely graphic sex descriptions, no extremely intense violence, no SA etc. That\u2019s the standard. You can crank it to level 100 when you\u2019re in private, in a setting where everybody can agree to ground rules. That\u2019s just not the case at a game store, even if a child wasn\u2019t present. \n\nIf they are keeping in line with normal appropriate behavior when in public, then there\u2019s no problem for a 10 year old to be there. It\u2019s not like the parents have asked for people to not have any alcohol, abstain from violence, limit swearing, or in any way compromised the players free expression in the game beyond the limit that naturally occurs by being *in public*. If they refuse to play their game as they have been (which i\u2019m assuming was appropriate or that would be mentioned in the post) because they don\u2019t want to swear in front of a 10 year old, that\u2019s their choice. If they feel it ruins their game, still their choice. But Emma did nothing wrong and doesn\u2019t deserve it taken away from her.", "NAH\n\nI see both sides of this coin. Emma has the gaming capabilities to keep up with adults and she\u2019s found a good group to play with, which is awesome.\n\nI also understand that it can be really hard to have time away from your kids, that parents who want adult time out of the home aren\u2019t hateful criminals, and that they thought they\u2019d found that place at your store.\n\nIf you wanted to keep things as-is I wouldn\u2019t blame you but if there\u2019s a chance you can shift things around so that there\u2019s an adults-only night and an all-ages night that might keep everyone happy.", "NTA at all, your are being inclusive and allowing players to participate without excluding someone who is clearly enriching the experience for others based solely on her age. I wish I was local, I'd love to see her run s game. Good DMs are hard to find and it's a high burnout job. I ran games for years and spent at least 20 hours a week planning (and illustrating NPCs and locations, plus making \"aged maps\" for players to find.) It's kind of exhausting so the rule should be NEVER remove the DM unless they cross some serious boundaries.", "If there's \"a couple of tables\" they can find another game or dm and play games without her.

Not to sound too Victorian but swearing and drinking in excess shouldn't be encouraged anyway. As a business owner, finding a niche that satisfies both parties is preferable but if someone says you should ban a paying customer of good conduct because *they* don't like them, that person is asking to take food off your table.

I wouldn't play in a store that didn't have at least a 14+ rule for this reason. Even if her parents are fine with her being present to witness that behaviour I would not feel comfortable displaying that level of trash talk competitiveness in front of a child and I think there are a lot of gamers who will feel the same and that will probably result in the loss of customers.

It\u2019s great that this young lady is enjoying herself but having someone who is ten as DM, not even a teenager, interacting with random adults on topics which will be varied and come up week by week means increased risk to Emma and also makes the game night not great for some participants.

There are children in it, but it's not specifically child-friendly. It's not designed and operated with children as the core customer.", "Honestly this is so heartwarming and sweet. Sooo many kids get shamed out of their passions, and it has made my morning to hear about how this little girl is being encouraged by so many adults in her life. No matter where she goes, she\u2019s gonna do great things", "This is amazing. I was very into D&D when I was about her age and my brother (8 years older than me) helped me make a character but then no one he played with wanted to play with me because they were all quite a bit older (late twenties, some with kids) and thought it was weird to play with kids, even though my brother would have been there and I was much like Emma.

They had taken out political figures, nobility, guard captains etc. that the doppelganger had claimed were corrupt, when instead those were the ones that were innocent.\n\nI believe they're still dealing with the aftermath from that.", "That's awesome!", "Emma is amazing!", "That 'kid' is going to be a major creator when she is an adult.\n\nI would love to get feedback from the other players when they found out they were the bad guys.\n\nNTA.

I'm glad you are making sure she can still come in to play", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, as a business owner, you have the right to decide the direction your business takes. Your choices (just like in any \"relationship\") may make you incompatible with some of your customers. If your choices were racist in nature (or misogynistic, etc) in nature, I'd say you were the asshole, but this clearly isnt the case. You opted for inclusion and that's lovely.\n\nAs a gamer myself, I can tell you that while it's not super common or consistent, it also isn't entirely uncommon to see a kid show up to local gaming stores here and play. When that happens, we work harder to watch what we say to make it a kid friendly space, but as far as I'm aware none of us are really bothered by it. It's a minor adjustment.\n\nThat having been said, my friends and I do like our adult time gaming. The store we go to doesn't allow consumption if alcoholic beverages (totally makes sense) and so while we play there at the local gaming store on Wednesdays, one of us (me) runs a game at their place on Fridays so we can drink and play magic the gathering.\n\nThey are grown ass adults. If they want a child free gaming space, it is within their means to figure out a way to make that happen. It's MUCH harder for a child to figure out a space where they'd be welcomed.", "NTA. I think it's so sad that gamers would want to keep youths away from DnD and other roleplaying groups. How will these hobbies continue to thrive if a lot of people can only really get into it after they're 18?\n\nAlso, I feel like a lot of people have become really entitled about having child free spaces. Children are members of the public. If you go out into the public, there will likely be some children. So long as they're behaving reasonably within socially acceptable behavior, why shouldn't they be allowed? Children are people. So long as a place isn't inherently dangerous or inappropriate, i don't think we have a right to treat them like second class citizens or pets and ban them. I don't think it's unreasonable for a DND party to tone down their play for a child the same way they might for an adult who is a bit more squeamish or is uncomfortable with blue humor. A good DND group always sets boundaries in the beginning anyway. And if any of the other parties are worried about the child overhearing them, they could sit further away from her. Realistically she'll be so focused on her own table she won't be tuning into their conversations.", "Um, as a DM, if all I read is true, Emma is a tiny god indeed.

(I would.)", "It made me smile that a group of nerdy adults was looking for a DM and they used that as an opportunity to teach/allow Emma to do so to get into the game. Especially for a female in that space, it means everything. Emma's never going to forget it, and she'll  be a long time lover of DnD. \n\nI think 11/12/13 is an appropriate age to hear dirty jokes and swearing, I heard my Dad and his friends a lot growing up, and like Emma's Mom stated she's at an age where she can comprehend/ understand what is okay for her to repeat or not.\n\nN T A", "NTA.

Back when I was a gaming store regular there was a kid about Emma's age who was often there on game nights. She was actually kind of annoying, but that was still my preferred store--because the kinds of players that wouldn't game around a middle schooler were often way more obnoxious to be around, so the place still had a much better vibe than the shops that didn't have kids hanging around. Stick to your guns, catering to the players that want you to make your space less inclusive is not going to do your business any favors.", "You're not the asshole, but don't be shocked when people stop coming to your store. We have 18+ rules for our GTA RP servers for exactly this reason. It's an adult activity with adults doing adult things, they can't do those things properly when they have to be concerned about a kid being around. (regardless of how kid's parents feel) \n\nRP folks are typically nerdy folks that don't do well in crowds. Making them uncomfortable is a surefire way to get rid of them.", "NAH.  I understand their perspective, but Emma hasn't done anything wrong.", "I'll go NAH, as long as they don't put up a fight about it.", "NTA, but please remember that there are fewer and fewer places for adults to relax as adults, with people even taking kids to bars, so make sure to strike a balance. Emma sounds great, but at the end of the day it's totally understandable that her presence might prevent a large portion of the adult patrons from truly enjoying themselves, and that just isn't fair, especially in a world that bends over backwards for kids. Make sure there are times for her to be there but also times when adults can be adults. At the very least make it clear that this is an adult place and that parents can't be mad if the child overhears things inappropriate for their age (cussing, mention of explicit topics, etc.)\n\nI will say you handled the complaint badly though. From the sounds of it the people were polite and had legitimate concerns, but you immediately went on the defensive with 'you can leave if you don't like it' instead of empathising and finding a way to make everyone happy. I won't be surprised if they DO find somewhere else to play and you'll both be down patrons and word will spread. I certainly wouldn't want to play D&D with a child present.", "NTA but I think a schedule would be good. Even if her parents are fine with swearing or having a beer around the kid, people aren't gonna be comfortable.", "NTA for telling them it was an open event. Emma appears to be participating fully, and doesn\u2019t need additional supervision beyond a parent just being there.\n\nHowever, I *do* feel for your players that want adult time, especially if they\u2019re parents. It can be hard for them to turn the \u201cparenting\u201d part off in their brain, so they can\u2019t help but always be keeping half an eye on Emma. And there can be games with themes or plots inappropriate for an adult to role-play with, or around, a child. \n\nI think it would be good to either block out an adult game night or adult game time\u2014like after 9:30 it\u2019s grown-ups only, or Tuesdays and Sundays are adults. \n\nYou can also push kid\u2018s nights, where people are specifically encouraged to bring their kids to play games, even have Emma (or another trusted person) run a simple one-shot for other kids to get a taste.\n\nBut I think aggressively establishing children are *always* welcome unless it\u2019s explicitly said otherwise is a good rule.", "NAH\n\nEmma seems the exception to the rule but I also get that adults want to have adult fun and not censor themselves. \n\nIf you\u2019re not worried they\u2019ll take their games elsewhere then as a business owner that\u2019s all you need to worry about.\n\nKids were definitely the reason why game night moved to our house Wednesday nights. Mostly unruly screaming unbabysitted kids, not an Emma, but still. \n\nSince we game away from the store, we also just shop off Amazon and miniature markets. Personally, I see no point in supporting a place where I don\u2019t play.", "Oh no! I can't swear and tell dirty jokes! My night is ruined!\n\nNTA.", "NAH - both viewpoints are perfectly valid. Adults-only spaces are normal and exist for a reason; OTOH, this child is obviously mature beyond her years and has made a positive contribution to your gaming community. \n\nAs the shop owner, you\u2019re well within your rights to make this decision. And the people who complain are well within their rights to find another place to game at. None of this rises to the level of assholery.", "NTA but because you\u2019re a business owner, sometimes you need to just make the annoying ones a little happy.

This honestly shouldn't be that much of an issue anyway, those players are busy at their table, this kid is busy running her own, there shouldn't be an issue unless they objecting players are obnoxiously loud.  To cap it all off, I've never heard of a gaming store surviving in business more than 5 minutes without the spending power of kids being a notable part of the store's business.
