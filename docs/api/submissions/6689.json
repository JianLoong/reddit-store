It's her favorite food and the tradition started when we were first dating. It continues to this day as a way for us to make time and appreciate the little things with one another.\n\nWe usually order after our two younger ones (7 and 10) are in bed. Our oldest is 14 and does his own thing most of the time on weekend nights, usually staying in his room. It isn't a secret that we do this, we often have a few leftovers (usually a few dumplings or crab rangoon) that we let the kids snack on.\n\nLately, my kids have asked to get chinese with us. Every once in awhile we will order for them as well as a treat. However, they are requesting that they be included every time. It's an extra 15-20$ a week for our children to eat so that's why it's an occasion for them, plus I enjoy having a special night with just my wife. Chinese takeout also isn't the healthiest food and I would rather not have my kids eating it regularly even though I do.\n\nThey are well fed every other night of the week and their grandparents take them out to eat  when they spend the night (usually once or twice a month, my parents like having our kids over) so it's not like they never ever eat at restaurants.\n\nWhen my oldest asked and the other two expressed their desire to join in I explained that this is something special between their mom and I. It's like a date for us. They whined a bit so I offered a compromise. We will include them more often - once a month rather than every few months. That way they still get to be included and we still have our tradition. They objected but I reminded them that this is a compromise and I don't have to include them at all. They then accepted the deal and got included tonight.\n\nMy wife thinks I'm being a bit harsh. That it isn't that much extra to include them. I said it isn't necessarily about the cost, but the fact that I enjoy having time thats just her and I. She still thinks we should just include our kids.

It could have been my birthday but the restaurant we\u2019d end up at would be what the kids wanted with the pressure from my now ex to always cater to them.  We didn\u2019t do date nights or have anything just for us.  I wished he would have modeled for them that our marriage mattered or even that I did.  \n\nI learned and now model to my teens that it\u2019s ok to be selfish at times.  As long as you have special traditions and fun things with the kids (and I assume you do) it\u2019s more than ok to keep this just for you and your wife.", "Mostly NTA - This is a date. Your relationship as mothers and fathers is very different from you relationship as partners and it is important to make time for both of these kinds of relationships. I think your compromise to include the kids once a month is a great one. BUT it is probably torture that this happens in the house and they are barred from participation. That is exclusionary and rude. A date is private and you need to make more of an effort to make it so now that your kids are aging and staying up later.", "NAH - you guys are viewing this Friday night ritual differently.\n\nYou look at it like a laid back date night, and she looks at it like some good family time.\n\nYou can solve this by going to the Chinese restaurant with your wife for x number of days a month, then spend the rest of the x number at home with your children. Or some other kind of compromise or even a new tradition to set just for the two of you.", "NTA, you're allowed to have a date. This sounds like an amazing time for you and your wife. But it may become trickier as they get older. Does the 14yo get his own dinner? Or do all the kids eat earlier and then the two younger go to bed? I think your compromise sounds nice.", "NTA- unless you\u2019re feeding them gruel while you eat yummy Chinese they\u2019ll survive.  And once a month is a great compromise.  Not to mention they get to go out with the grandparents also. Couples need things that can be just theirs in addition to family things. My husband still does stuff that was \u201cour\u201d stuff when we were dating and it means a lot ten years and one kid later! Y\u2019all are having an at home date and that\u2019s perfectly fine! We are homebodies and prefer to order takeout instead of going out, we still make it a date night. And Not a thing wrong with that imo.", "NAH\n\nYou said your wife doesn't want to go out to a restaurant, you guys have this little, inexpensive tradition to get Chinese, snuggle on the couch and watch movies. That sounds like a blissful evening to me too.\n\nYou've compromised with your children so they're included, just not every week and you're trying to find a good balance between being a family and just being you and your wife. I think it's incredibly healthy, necessary and considerate of your wife that you carve out time for just her.\n\nYou're not just \"Dad\" and she's not just \"Mom\", nothing wrong with taking a few hours a week to reconnect with each other, especially while the kids are sleeping or doing their own thing.\n\nEdit - words.", ">They are well fed every other night of the week\n\nINFO: are you not feeding your kids on these nights??", "NTA. As a date at home couple, we typically order food for the kids earlier in the evening, they pick and after they go to bed we order for us to eat and watch a movie. They get a treat and so do we, not always the same treat just not at the same time.", "In my opinion mostly NTA, you can't forego date time and it might be healthier in the long run for kids to see and understand that you have a life outside of them that you enjoy. When they're older and solvent they too can buy all the Chinese food they want, it's just not a big deal. That said every single Friday sounds like a bit much. Especially if your wife is happy to include them/doesn't mind either way, maybe time for a new tradition?", "NTA. Couples deserve to have their own things even when they have kids.", "NTA, It doesn't sound like you're denying your kids anything that they need, and I think it's good for kids to understand that they don't need to be included in everything their parents do. You're raising them to eventually go off on their own, and it's important to keep your identity as an individual and as a couple. Little traditions like these can help keep relationships strong, and it benefits kids to have parents that love and enjoy each other's company.", "Nope, NTA. Not everything has to be about your kids, some things can be just for you. You can stretch to letting them have leftovers, or occasionally buying more food for them to have with you, but the core of this is an adult treat, for adults, not for the whole family. \nThis is a good boundary to have - the kids get to learn they can't have everything, you get some solo adult time - so long as you aren't too rigid or cruel in enforcing it, which it doesn't sound like you are.", "NTA you're allowed to have something just with the wife.", "NTA! Kids can be relationship killers. The fact that you\u2019ve made a consistent effort to have a special meal just with your wife on a weekly basis is amazing!", "I think YTA because of the frequency. If this takeout routine was happening monthly instead of weekly, it would be actually more of a special treat and something you could more easily justify. But every single week you\u2019re ordering delicious food, that I\u2019m sure they can smell, into the house and not allowing your kids to have any unless you happen to have a dumpling leftover? That feels rude to me. Plus, your kids are getting older and going to bed later. Are you going to eat dinner at 10 pm every Friday next year so your tween and teen can\u2019t see and smell the food arriving? \n\nIt\u2019s great that you have one on one time with your wife every week. But if your kids ask to be included in the food order, you should let them! You don\u2019t have to eat it at the same time. But if the adults get a weekly special treat the kids should be able to as well.", "NTA. Once a month is *great*.  When my oldest kids were finally old enough to sit for the younger 2, we started going out regularly, once a week, while the kids stayed home.  I wish we had done something like this earlier.   Your kids will survive having Chinese take out 1/month, instead of 1/week, while the parents have it weekly.   It\u2019s is an absolute fact that a happy, strong marriage is better for the kids, and parents getting a special time together is good for their marriage.\n\nKids don\u2019t need to have every treat they want.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou should get takeout for the whole family or no one. Your kids can eat it separately watching a movie or something. That will be their sibling night. \n\nMeanwhile, you and your wife can sit together, light candles and make it a date night where kids don\u2019t disturb you because they are busy too. \n\nYes it\u2019s spending a bit more but ultimately a win win for all", "NTA\n\nDate nights, even the ones you make a date-at-home, are extremely important. You wait til after bedtime for the kids, so it\u2019s not like you get it for dinner and then give the kids boxed mac and cheese while you eat takeout. \n\nMy husband and I do something similar but not on a set day, and not always Chinese food. Sometimes we just get dinner for everyone, but sometimes we do late night munchies and cuddle and watch movies. We only get to maybe twice a month but these evenings give us life.", "NTA because this is essentially a date and parents deserve to have a life outside their kids. I think your compromise was a good one.\n\nThat said, it can be quite the bummer to watch someone else eat good food in front of you while you aren\u2019t allowed to have any. Maybe as the kids get older, you can consider going to a restaurant instead of doing takeout?", "NTA.... Your \"date night in\"  tradition is important to your marriage.\nYour children are fed and their needs are met. This is so very different than depriving them and it's not about the money.\nContrary to popular belief, it's not mean for you and you wife to have something together, without the children.  It's healthy for the children to see this. \nFor those saying it's mean and \"if you want to go on a date then go out\" that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life ! \nThey do not have to leave their house to have time together. That \"time \"together brought those children into this world and it doesn't stop because the children are now there. Date night in, is a lovely tradition and even more beneficial to the children who do not have to be with  a sitter or have their routine changed.\nNeglecting your marriage and making \"everything about your children\"  is being mean to your kids. It's depriving them of healthy models, appropriate boundaries and realistic ideas.\nKeep your tradition. You do not have to make it about them. Letting them on it, occasionally would be ok. But making it about them every time, takes away from your marriage. Nothing has to be taken from one or the other. These are two separate accounts that need nurturing.", "NTA.  Kids need to understand that they aren't entitled to share in every single thing. They need to know that their parents love each other.  They need to know that not everything is about them.  This teaches all of that. It helps keep your marriage strong and reinforces that your relationship isn't ALL about the kids.\n\nAs long as your kids are well-fed and well-loved, they are fine.  Better than fine, as you are setting an excellent example for them.  Years from now they will look to your example in learning how to navigate relationships. \n\nYou are very wise to keep some independence from the kids in your relationship with your wife.  She needs to be your wife, not just the mother, and you need to be her husband,  not just the father.  You seem to sense this instinctively,  and that's a great big green flag for the future of your marriage.   \n\nIt is a sad and painful truth, but kids grow up.  They leave and develop their own lives.  This is what you want for them, and the fact that it happens means that you raised strong,  confident,  healthy kids.  The fact that you are tending your marriage now is a part of what you are teaching them.", "YTA I could understand if you were going out and away from them, but never did my parents bring food in the house and say \u201cnope you can\u2019t eat it,\u201d or save the best bits for themselves.", "YTA. If you and your wife went out for dinner it'd be okay but bringing food into the house that your kids can see and smell but aren't allowed to eat is cruel now that at least one of them is old enough to still be up when you're eating.", "YTA. Date night at home while excluding your children is not a thing for a reason. You can't eat a special meal in front of your kids and tell them they can't have any or participate. That's just basically a punishment at that point. Just go out to a restaurant and have a real date night or get takeout for everyone. Also telling them I can eat this unhealthy food, but you can't eat it because it's unhealthly is not good logic. Children learn alot more from your actions than your words", "NTA, and you\u2019re showing your kids that taking care of your relationship and doing special things together is important. I think your compromise is perfect.", "YTA\n\nYou're ordering food your kids want to eat but excluding them and they know it. That's something they won't forget as it's borderline mean to do to them. \n\nIf you want date nights, go on an actual date out to Chinese. Once they're older, go back to ordering every Friday. Being rigid in traditions that start to exclude those you love is just shitty.", "YTA. So you\u2019re getting take out to feed only you and your wife. You say you can\u2019t afford to feed them? Then why are you eating from a restaurant?\n\nThose are your children, not your neighbors.\n\nIf you want a \u201cdate night\u201d, go out.", "YTA. I'm stuck on the \"I don't have to include them at all.\" Um, those are your children. WTF! You can include them and still enjoy your own personal time with your wife.\n\nAlso, as the adult, you set the example for your children. It's hypocritical to say I want them to eat healthier despite me intentionally eating whatever I want.", "Yta. My kids don't like Chinese, when we get it I order a pizza for them. Take out night should be for the whole family.", "Yup YTA 100%. Hire a babysitter and actually take wife out of the house.", "YTA. I understand it will add up, but consider how you all don't have your lives assured and how you just hurt your children's feelings. And instead of just being you two, you all could do this as family and start another tradition.\n\nMaybe you could compromise on a set date, like once or twice a month if you don't want to lose your privacy entirely. But you could do both and just squeeze this cost from somewhere else if you budget and plan for it.", "YTA.   \n\n\nYou can get food for them and still have your quality time together, you know? No need to spend the whole night with them when bringing takeout-food. But excluding them... yeah, that sucks.", "YtA.", "NTA. You can also get Chinese a couple more times a month that includes the kids.", "YTA", "YTA  \n\n\nIf you are getting takeout then it is normal for parents to get takeout for the whole family.\n\nI don't understand how your children eating Chinese food could put a damper on your tradition. The children need to eat dinner so why shouldn't they be allowed to eat the same. Most Chinese restaurants have plates which include a portion of the entree; some rice and generally an egg roll and some soup. You could order plates for them and order what you and your wife would ordinarily order.\n\nI am not understanding how actually feeding your children Chinese food somehow ruins the tradition of your eating Chinese food and watching a move.\n\nIf you really want a child free date night, hire a baby sitter. Your oldest is actually of an age when you could pay him to babysit the younger kids.", "YTA", "NTA. You\u2019re trying to keep some time just for you and your wife and you have offered a reasonable compromise, maybe see how it goes for a bit and you can re-asses if she still feels this way?", "YTA.  \nIf it\u2019s about time with your wife then why not order them the food.  You can reserve your portions and eat it after the kids are in bed.", "NTA. This is alone time with you and your wife. It's not a bad idea to get them some food, and hand it to them to take to their room(s) and eat, or at least to a place where you are not.", "NAH. You both have valid reasons for how you want this to be, you just need to find a compromise. I\u2019m sure you both come up with something reasonable so that the kids aren\u2019t feeling totally left out. Maybe make every other Friday a pizza night for the kids, while you\u2019re doing your traditional meal in another room?", "YTA because a weekly \u201cdate night\u201d that you do at home in front of your three children is absurd and borderline rude, especially if you can\u2019t afford an additional $20 (def couldn\u2019t find a place that cheap where I live) to make it for everyone. I also can\u2019t imagine eating the same exact takeout every week, so I find this hard to believe.\n\nIf it was monthly, sure n t a. But weekly is just a lot when you have kids that are noticing and voicing their desire to be treated less like babies and more like the preteens/teens they are (minus the 7 YO).\n\nBut I truly find this hard to believe.", "YTA \n\nYou're not wrong for your point but you absolutely need to change how you talk about this; once a week you and your wife have a date. On that Friday night, you and your wife have your date and your kids aren't invited. I do think you and your wife should talk it out further and figure out a schedule since it sounds like she wants to do like a family date night at least once a month, but you are allowed to tell your kids that they aren't a part of every single thing you and your wife do as a couple.\n\nI do agree with what other people are saying and that the frequency of the dates, and the fact that you're choosing to do them at home, does make it kind of an asshole move to exclude your kids so much. Like every Friday night you two are getting take out and your kids are just supposed to disappear for the night?\n\n It sounds like you need to do these date nights less and save up to hire a babysitter for that night and then go and take your wife out for a movie and dinner instead. And I do think you should also be listening to your wife on her opinion on this. Because you've had kids, your situation is different from when you two were a couple without children. You can't just expect them to disappear one night a week", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids need to know they will not always have everything the same as everyone else.\n\nif my family did that, mom and dad and the kids would never have had any fun.  7 kids meant we accepted that if our sibling/s were out with mom or dad and we were home, then it was not our business to ask or be butthurt if they got something while they were out. And there was no guarantee the next time we were out with either of them that there would be money for us to get something, either.\n\nThey are not neglecting to feed their kids.

Mom and dad are not just parents, they are also in a relationship with each other.  That relationship is going to be with them long after their kids have left home, if they protect it.  Plus, their kids will see how important it is to be a partner to their spouse, and build on their relationship together.", "No", "Not every woman likes going out. OP stated that in a comment. \nDate night at HOME is my preferred date any day of the week. People and crowds are awful.", "Why?", "I've offered to take her out, but she prefers to stay in and watch a movie/show we wouldn't if our children were awake and moving.", "Some women don't want to be taken out though???? \nFor instance my wife has HELLA ANXIETY. The ONLY reason she ever wants to go out is because sometimes I like to. (I'm also a women and I find eating out... kind of annoying). \n\nI'd much rather stay in and eat at home.", "Exactly, this sounds like a nice way to incorporate a date into regular life. Kids don't need to be a part of everything and it's important to maintain adult relationships. \n\nIt's also important for the kids to see their parents have a relationship separate from them.", "Ok good. NTA, your compromise sounds reasonable.", "Maybe explain that the Chinese food is less so a takeout sorta situation and more a date if that makes sense? Like it's the same thing as them going out with their grandparents except you are an adult and need to stay in sometimes. And maybe tell the kids that if you need to leave to do your dates then that might mean the 14yo would have to babysit for an hour or two. Though that could backfire if your kid is looking to babysit lol.", "And it sounds like she wants the full family involved now. So if you want one on one. Take her out.", "Disagree. Babysitters are expensive and having alone time as a couple is more important that the kids in this specific circumstance. Having kids and stayed close with your partner takes effort like what OP and his wife do. I mean this is basically the same thing my husband and I do to.", "What part of she prefers to stay in did you not understand? You want him to force her to go out?", "I\u2019m going soft YTA. As someone whose parents often ordered food and ate it while we were expected to eat frozen chicken nuggets for the 4th night in a row, it gets old, and it\u2019s kind of rude. \n\nAt 14, you cannot get a job (in most places) and have to rely on your parents for meals. While nobody is entitled to takeout as opposed to cheap at-home meals, it\u2019s disheartening to see that it\u2019s clearly within the budget, but you\u2019re being left out. Seeing my parents go out to eat every weekend at VERY expensive restaurants while we sat at home, alone, eating frozen food, sucked. I understand where your kids are coming from.\n\n\u201cWe pay the bills! Be grateful!\u201d Yeah, no shit, you\u2019re the parents.", "Yta I absolutely think couple's should have some alone time, traditions and indulgences. I think getting special food in the house while your kids are there that they aren't allowed to have every week is probably the meanest way you can do it though. Of course this is going to cause resentment, it already has. Also it doesn't sound like your wife is fully in agreement so at the very least you need to find an agreement with your wife about how you handle traditions. \n\n\nI'm seeing some comments about how your relationship should be a priority over your children and if that's your thought just don't have kids. Kids know when they're second place to you. I don't think you prioritize one relationship over the other to the point of hurt feelings. It's all about finding a balance.", "Of Course YTA, LOL Stop being ridiculous", "YTA", "YTA, what a ridiculous way to exclude your kids in favor of 'couple time'! Complaining about the cost to feed your own children is gross as hell!", "YTA. If you're too poor too afford takeout for your kids you shouldn't have had kids.", "NAH\nAs parents, it is healthy to have date nights. But doing it while in the house is a bit \u00ab\u00a0in your face\u00a0\u00bb to your kids. \n\nAs long as you still do something special with them once in a while, I would not call you an asshole. \n\nMy husband and I are just back from a 2 nights trip childless (kids had a blast with grandma) So I would be hypocrite to tell you to always include your children in everything.", "My late husband was the eldest of 6. When his dad came home from WWII he was fond of Asian food. But, getting Chinese take-out for a family of 7, or even buying enough cans of Chung-King to feed them all, was an expensive proposition for a young family in the \u201850s and 60s. So, that became his dad\u2019s treat. Once every month or so, he\u2019d get Chinese for the two of them while the kids ate whatever their mom made. My husband didn\u2019t taste Asian food, himself, until he was in the Coast Guard. Did he love it? Yes. Did he bemoan missing out on it as a kid? Kinda. But, mostly, the memory of *not* getting it as a kid was one of those things that he pointed to as an example of the bond between his dad and mom. That was *their* thing. It wasn\u2019t something he shared with the kids, but he shared it with her.", "I mean, potions are always huge in Chinese takeaway. You can\u2019t let them make a plate? YTA", "NAH. I have these problems because I have 3 kids, and it does get expensive. We eat out a whole lot less than we used to. But if we do something like this it is a lot cheaper to distract the kids with a homemade pizza or something they enjoy that we make at home. The we put them to bed and have our own \"date night\" dinner.", "NTA It\u2019s good to have things that are just for the two of you. It\u2019s healthy for a relationship especially after kids.", "You're NTA. Your kids can understand date night. This will teach them to appreciate the small things their partners can do with them even when married with kids. Not every date night needs to be out spending a lot of money. You've even compromised to include your kids once a month.", "NAH. Yall two see it a a date night. She sees it as a family night. Need better commucatioms.", "Nta date night is important to keep marriage alive", "NTA. What Hubby and I do when we plan on a date night at home is when we go to get our snacks/food we get snack for the for the next day. They know that there's something for them and know that what we bought for us is for us. We've been doing this for a really long time. \n\nSo continue with your tradition and maybe buy something extra for them to share the next day.", "nta. would it make it worse to get some frozen chinese food and cream cheese wontons or egg rolls at walmart for their dinner time and then ya\u2019ll order your chinese later? lol i don\u2019t know as a kid if i would\u2019ve even noticed a taste difference or cared.", "NTA. This was so common to do when I was a kid (late 70s and early 80s). There was adult world and kid world. The modern tendency to want to involve kids in EVERYTHING is really detrimental to the couple\u2019s relationship, and you can totally do a little thing for the kids, like they get a special snack that night (they\u2019re probably not going to be as excited by Jell-O as I was, but you know what I mean).", "NTA. This is a sacred relationship ritual. Don\u2019t include the kids in everything and keep some things to yourselves. I wish my parents had this, I don\u2019t remember them ever even going on a date or anywhere without us. They don\u2019t have couple rituals, only family ones.", "NTA", "Nta- this is a date with your wife and they absolutely don\u2019t need to be included. However this would be a great teaching moment if done correctly because your children aren\u2019t going to fully understand the significance of a date. \n\nSo explain it in a way that\u2019s going to make sense to them. For example, your 14 year old would be extremely upset if every time he went to the movies with friends he had to bring his siblings? Or how would your 10 year old feel if everything they did had to include the other two? \n\nI feel like if it was explained like this they might be more understanding to the situation and it also teaches them that you can be a family and still have a sense of individuality", "I mean... technical NTA I guess? Is there something ELSE you could give the kids to bribe them out of butting in on your little date night though? Like, when I was a kid my parents wanted to be able to spend the evening together without kids being in and out. So if you were in your room and staying there by 8, you got a bowl of popcorn when mom made it for them. Is there something you could offer the kids like that? Anyone who stays put and doesn't whine about Chinese night can have a bowl of ice cream before bed or a cheap toy or something?", "nta, maybe just explain it\u2019s your date night", "I honestly think it's really mean. It just sucks to be at home every Friday watching and smelling your parents get a special treat that you aren't allowed to have. I don't know that savoring a meal your kid can't have in their face is the best way to have a happy marriage. It is really rude to bring food their kids can't have.", "No way, this is SUPER shitty of OP. Every, single week they eat take out and exclude their kids. Sometimes my wife and I treat ourselves, but never in front of the kids and certainly not every Friday or whatever. Its cruel and rude to do that. If they want a date, go on a date. Sitting in your living room while you eat take out once a week is not a date. And if it's too expensive to include the kids, maybe do it every other week so that the kids can be included. This is just tremendously selfish of OP\n\nYTA", "Well op and his wife get to eat out every week and the kids eat out once or twice a month if the grandparents feel like it and occasionally they get OP's scraps. \n\nI have a ton of special traditions with my husband. Never has that included eating special treats that other people in the house weren't allowed to have, every week. That just seems like such a hurtful way to go about it.", "I'm with you.  My husband did the same thing.  The last straw was when he bought me a video game for Xmas that one of the kids wanted, not something I wanted AND he didn't work so he did it with my money (technically our money but I wanted him to work AND he didn't do any of the SAHD work.)\n\nOP and wife aren't even getting a \"date night\" they get a late night takeaway dinner where they can eat \"garbage\" food alone together.  I think it's sweet that they've kept this up over so many years.", "YTA. I agree with this as well. I couldn\u2019t imagine excluding my kids while we got a special meal.", "My first thought was cute kids pizza night too but if extra Chinese entr\u00e9es are too expensive, doubling down on take out probably isn\u2019t going to fly\u2026 I think the OP is a little too hung up on the bargain aspect of this and could just order an extra appetizer. Sure, it\u2019s not the healthiest but you can move past the badgering.", "Or to keep it budget friendly, leave the 14 year old to baby sit and go have a take-out picnic at the park.", "You can't expect kids to go on dates with their parents, and this family cannot afford to buy the kids take away every week, OP has already said this. \n\nKids need to understand that their parents need alone time. The 14 year old will likely already understand this. The younger two can be taught.", "OP already says that they can't really afford to include the kids with this. Parents are allowed alone time, and not everyone can afford expensive dates, such as you suggest.", "Ya that's why at the end of my post I said \"But it is probably torture that this happens in the house and they are barred from participation. That is exclusionary and rude. A date is private and you need to make more of an effort to make it so now that your kids are aging and staying up later.\" Bc it does sound like this was a tradition they started before kids and kept up while they kids were too young to notice or care (since they did it after bedtime which is a very normal thing for parents to do) meaning they could save on babysitter charges and still bond, but they fact that they kept it up after the kids were aware and staying up is totally fucked", "I think they're using torture in a non-literal sense, tbf. \n\nThough Chinese food often smells *really* good, like, mouthwateringly good, so if it's from a great place then it *could* be actual torture to not have some haha", "Because they do it *every week fully aware that the kids love this food too while the eldest is still up*. The occasional date night at the house when the kids are asleep is one thing, take out traditions every single week that happen right under the kid's aware noses with food they love is another. This isn't just telling your not to eat on their own bc tonight you're having a takeout date, this is habitual exclusion under the guise of a date. I think it's rude, and so do the kids and wife judging by this post.", "Quoting myself, since it seems like you didn't read my post: \"That is exclusionary and rude. A date is private and you need to make more of an effort to make it so now that your kids are aging and staying up later.\"   \n\n\nI do think it is important for children to understand parents have a secondary romantic aspect of the family relationship that they are not to partake in, but I agree that the frequency with which OP and his family does it is exclusionary", "I disagree.  The food is ordered after the kids are usually in bed and leftovers aren\u2019t \u201cscraps.\u201d Kids don\u2019t have to be included in everything.  If they shared a bottle of wine every Friday night, no one would be telling him to include the kids.  Just because it\u2019s takeout doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be an entire family event.  \n\nMy parents went to Hawaii without me as a kid.  I threw a ginormous fit about it and did everything I could to make them feel guilty.  I was terrible.  Instead, I went to my grandmas and actually had a wonderful time with her making memories I\u2019m so thankful to have because she passed soon after.  As an adult, I now get it.  My dad has since passed and my mom is thankful they carved out that time just for the two of them.  They needed it.  I\u2019ve told her since that I\u2019m happy she put the two of them first and taught me that not everything was going to be about me.  I wasn\u2019t treated poorly or excluded, that trip just wasn\u2019t about me. \n\nI think more people should do as the OP is doing and emphasize time for their marriage.  I think it\u2019s absolutely wonderful.", "If they don\u2019t have the money for everyone, I personally don\u2019t think they should buy it at all. They chose to have children. It\u2019s a lifelong commitment, and they can\u2019t just leave their kids out of good things because \u201cthey\u2019re kids\u201d.", "Did your parents ever bring home ice scream for the same sibling every week that the rest of you weren't allowed to have? That would be much closer to the situation OP is describing. The marriage should be a priority along with the kids. Is there truly no better way to have quality time than eating special treats in front of the kids every week that they aren't allowed to have?", "I agree, I read posts all the time here and it's very obvious which have been given adult status as children-they really do believe they are on equal standing as adults....and deserve and should absolutely get to have every treat/privilege their parents (by working) get for themselves.", "Alone time in the house the kids live in during a reasonable hour (at least for the 14 year old) to be up? Kids staying up later and you no longer being able to have alone time in your house is a perfect reason for tradition to change. Go out once a month as a couple and just have a family dinner the other Fridays or something. Just don\u2019t dangle the dinner in front of your kids.", "I know, I want OP\u2019s takeout right now", "I agree! But I think the frequency they've chosen to do this at changes the circumstances a bit from romantic date night to exclusion. I like OP's compromise about adding them into the mix more, but I don't blame the kids for being frustrate their parents keep eating this food they love right in front of them while telling them no.", "My understanding from the post is that they're whining about not getting it not because of the food itself, but because they're not getting to join in with their parents. It's healthy and important to a relationship for a couple to have time to themselves away from their children, and for children to learn that they're not always going to get their way. And OP did mention that it happens while the younger children are asleep, and extended a reasonable compromise that lets them join in on the tradition while getting to keep it to himself and his wife on other nights, so they're not totally shut out from it.\n\nI think it would be helpful if OP explained to his oldest that the meals are dates between him and his wife, and the oldest is old enough that he should be able to understand that that's the significant part of the tradition and that his parents deserve that special bonding time. And for what it's worth, the kids are otherwise being fed well and get to go out to restaurants, so it doesn't sound like they're being deprived.\n\nAlso, I don't want to attribute this sentiment to you, since I don't know if you intended it, but the phrasing \"habitual exclusion under the guise of a date\" comes across as presumptive that OP is denying his children inclusion in his dates out of malice. Exclusion is not inherently a bad thing."]}
