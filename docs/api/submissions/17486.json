They're the ones showing favoritism.", "NTA but your parents definitely are.\n\nI was prepared to say YTA until I read what your sister did for your birthday. Your sister literally makes ignorant comments about you being adopted, and keeps the birthday money she was supposed to use to get you a gift, and your parents do nothing, but you get in crap for taking a stand? \n\nSpeaking as a mom with multiple adopted family members, your parents need to get their crap together, and stop playing favourites. I can't even say your sister is TA, because in this scenario she is a child, and your parents are teaching her that her behaviour is okay. Kids don't do better unless they're taught better, and your parents clearly aren't teaching her better, and that's 100% on them.", "NTA: OP, if she kept the $20 intended for your birthday as her own birthday present, well, yes, she already got her birthday present. Your sister Jenna sounds resentful & dismissive; your parents don't seem willing to address her behavior. Good for Grandma; she sees the imbalance in this situation.", "NTA, why would she expect a gift from you when she didn't give you one? Where was your parents outrage when she kept their $20 for herself?", "NTA.. ngl the card bit was funny. Glad your grandma at least had some sense and backed you up, Rachel shouldn't have expected anything if she didn't get you anything either.", "Nta.  Your parents need to deal with her incredibly toxic behavior.", "NTA. Your sister has a lot of issues, and she is lashing out at you (she might need professional help). You kept the $20 and she kept the $20 and got a card, that is fair and a life lesson for her. Treat people the way you would like them to treat you and vis versa. In any case, you need to have a serious chat about the way your sister is treating you in general and how it makes you feel, that this is one incident too many. Your grandma is brilliant though and you might want to consider moving if things don't improve. Just a thought.", "NTA  \n\n\nBUT, for your sake, don't engage in your older sister's pettiness. You'll go far if you learn to ignore people like her.", "NTA, and your family needs therapy. I'm a mom through adoption, and if any family members treated my kids the way your sister treats you, I would not stand for it. Your parents are letting Rachel emotionally and mentally abuse you, and that is unacceptable. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA i honestly would've done the same", "NTA. I wouldn't make the effort for someone who was given money to get me a gift but chose to keep it for herself. I'm surprised your parents let her get away with that, let alone made you apologize to her for pointing it out.

It's not like she's a little kid who does not know better.", "NTA, why should gift giving be one sided?", "It was petty, but Rachel deserved it.\n\nGM is not favoring you, she wants you to be treated like your siblings.
