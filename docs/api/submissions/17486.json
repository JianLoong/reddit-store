They're the ones showing favoritism.", "NTA but your parents definitely are.\n\nI was prepared to say YTA until I read what your sister did for your birthday. Your sister literally makes ignorant comments about you being adopted, and keeps the birthday money she was supposed to use to get you a gift, and your parents do nothing, but you get in crap for taking a stand? \n\nSpeaking as a mom with multiple adopted family members, your parents need to get their crap together, and stop playing favourites. I can't even say your sister is TA, because in this scenario she is a child, and your parents are teaching her that her behaviour is okay. Kids don't do better unless they're taught better, and your parents clearly aren't teaching her better, and that's 100% on them.", "NTA: OP, if she kept the $20 intended for your birthday as her own birthday present, well, yes, she already got her birthday present.

Edit: to correct name", "NTA, why would she expect a gift from you when she didn't give you one?

Your parents need to deal with her incredibly toxic behavior.", "NTA. Your sister has a lot of issues, and she is lashing out at you (she might need professional help). You kept the $20 and she kept the $20 and got a card, that is fair and a life lesson for her. Treat people the way you would like them to treat you and vis versa. In any case, you need to have a serious chat about the way your sister is treating you in general and how it makes you feel, that this is one incident too many. Your grandma is brilliant though and you might want to consider moving if things don't improve. Just a thought.", "NTA  \n\n\nBUT, for your sake, don't engage in your older sister's pettiness.

I wouldn't make the effort for someone who was given money to get me a gift but chose to keep it for herself.

She can step up. Until then, she can lay in the bed she made for herself. It costs literally nothing for her to be a decent human being, but she decided to be hot garbage, and for some reason your parents decided that was right and proper.\n\nNTA.

She also says she\u2019s going to split everything evenly between us (her health isn\u2019t the best so she\u2019s been talking about this) but before she splits everything she wants me to go through her stuff and take whatever I want, then the rest will be split between everyone (including me)", "She was also adopted and hit her head a few times as a baby so they make a lot of excuses for her because of it.", "She hit her head a few times as a baby (she was also adopted) so my parents always make excuses for her.", "Nta and doesn't matter as in this case it's the correct thing to do and your parents are ah s for not treating all children alike.", "Yeah your parents are definitely the ones who are TA in this situation.

Since she's a teen, I blame the parents MORE for her behavior, because they have enabled it for what? A decade(maybe less since 3 yr olds usually aren't quite so deliberate in their actions).  \n\nSO Aholes=Your parents.  Rachel with some therapy? Maybe she could turn into a decent human.
