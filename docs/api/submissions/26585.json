It never occurred to me, despite seeing people in rodeos with hats\u2026", "Yeah. That\u2019s why we are asking if OP and the salesperson took the time to explain what the fit should ideally be. She can\u2019t \u201clisten\u201d to something not said to her. \n\nOP says when she said it fit fine the salesperson just accepted it and waved off his concern\u2026 So it didn\u2019t sound like they checked the fit or explained it. \n\nAnd from OPs replies which are all \u201cshe grew up around this she should know\u201d I\u2019d say he also didn\u2019t make it clear.", "Dude, rodeo riders hats come off *all the time*. Unless you ride and have previously had a hat fitted or are rich and have had your hats fitted, **no one** knows this kind of shit.", "Based on the fact that there are whole subreddits around bra fitting and tons of advice about tailoring/fitting clothing, I seriously doubt it\u2019s as uncommon as you think. Most people buy off the rack which means there\u2019s a learning curve to how custom fitting should work.", "A hat fitting is going to depend on what you want to happen with it. There are many situations in which I wouldn't want a hat to be super tight because I don't want to end up with hat hair.\n\n\"Fitting\" is relative.", "Have you guys ever wore a hat? I'm a city man, I don't do rodeo, but even I know that you get fitting caps/hats so that they don't fly away at the first gush of wind.\n\nDo you see everyone running after their headgarments whenver it's windy?", "I grew up in a rural area. My mom did lesser rodeo events when she was young. My best friend in high school raised horses used in rodeos. I still never knew a hat could be fitted so it wouldn't come off your head in the wind. I don't know why you think that's something everyone already knows.", "I was in a wedding party where we all wore top hats. I got mine fitted and so did everyone else. England has an amazing customer service culture for some stuff.", "OP is definitely giving off the impression that he assumed she knew what a properly fit cowboy hat should feel like and only didn't ask for further fitting because she is a people pleaser. And like duh how can you not understand that. His condescending attitude does say quite a bit about why his wife doesn't ask further questions.", "His responses here make him sound like a really poor communicator who tries to boost himself up by acting superior.  Probably a coping mechanism but I cannot take those types seriously.", "I\u2019m not saying he should buy her a new one, it\u2019s okay to say you can\u2019t afford it. But acting like her  school principal and scolding her is not an action I associate with a loving healthy relationship.", "I\u2019m not saying you should replace the hat.  But if my partner lost an expensive item I would respond with compassion because people make mistakes.  I couldn\u2019t imagine thinking this was a time where it was appropriate or helpful for me to act like an authority figure teaching a lesson.", "I don't think you need to replace the hat, and it's unreasonable for her to expect you to.\nBut you're talking about her like she's a child. You could just commiserate that it's too bad the hat blew away, and you're sorry she's upset.", "You may not be TA in the story but you are definitely an A lol", "What makes you think she knew how much it cost, given that it was a gift?", "You asked why I would think that. That's why I would think that, not being familiar with cowboy hats. \n\nWhy would I know that?", "Not for not replacing it but the \"I told you so attitude\" is yucky", "Now I know your an AH.  Wow.", "Really? If you are interested I can point you to their website. They have much more expensive hats than that. And they had cheaper canvas hats.", "Most of our gifts to each other are fairly useless.  We have everything we need already. The last thing she bought me was floor mats for my new car. Which came with floor mats. Just not cool ones.", "A whole 3,000 pounds? Will this 3,000 pounds be an angry steak?", "It\u2019s Reddit, and I admitted that I have a character flaw of any sort. I definitely expected a few annoying \u201clet me tell you how to fix this, you don\u2019t know anything and you suck\u201d comments but the aggression did take me a little off guard I won\u2019t lie lol. Man\u2019s gotta fuck Christ because I wouldn\u2019t get a cowboy hat fitted if it was me", "She was told she should get it fitted. She chose not to and is now reaping the consequences.", "I think if my family did rodeo, like the wife\u2019s family, I might pick up a thing or two. Or how about the fact that op said she should have gotten it fitted for no extra cost. I think if I was getting any piece of clothing and they offered to fit it for no extra cost, I\u2019d hop on that pretty quick. Be dumb not to.", "See, I moved to a city known for it's heavy winds. Before this, I had no problem wearing hats that were just cheap and not fitted at all. Like yes, they fit, but they also would blow off my head pretty easily. Now I no longer wear hats unless they're beanies!!", "Most people don't wear hats daily these days, except for sock hats worn in the winter which stretch to fit and stay on better. I've owned a few hats over the years--a straw one that did blow away sometimes, and a beret that stayed on but was uncomfortably tight. \n\nI'm pretty sure headgarments blowing away was a big part of life when daily hats were a thing. There are whole cartoons about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RCAtCZwIbE", "The hats I have experience with use hat pins to keep them from flying away.", "Okay, so i understand that maybe it's a thinking issue, not an education issue. \nUnless you're telling me all the jeans in every shop fit you?", "He made the critical error of assuming ppl like you have common sense when it\u2019s obviously not the case", "You have a pretty cool hat collection, my guy. Any other styles lurking in there? Sombrero? Homburg? Fez?", "I'd never heard of needing a hat so fitted to your head, if I was her I'd be thinking \"it fits on my head, it's fine\".", "It\u2019s okay not to buy her a new one even if he could afford it, because that\u2019s a lot of money on hats. I also don\u2019t think he should lecture her, but if she asks for a new one he could just reasonably say he can\u2019t justify buying one more. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen anything that indicates he keeps scolding and lecturing his wife. He\u2019s arguing in the comments, sure. That\u2019s another thing though.", "But the problem is that she isn\u2019t just upset. She expects him to pay for another $600 hat.", "> She said she wanted to go back to the store to replace it. I asked her if her budget could handle it.\n\nI'm pretty sure that at some point in this conversation, and given that she was TALKING TO THE SALESPERSON, the cost of the hat did in fact come up at least once.", "You got me there, she might think it doesn't cost much at all and in that case OP needs to let her know why he isn't buying her the hat again.", "I definitely agree there.\n\nShe lost the gift, and he's under no obligation to replace it. Especially given its expense. But his whole attitude about how it's her dumb fault is just... urgh.\n\nA simple \"sorry, that gift was expensive and I can't afford to replace it\" would do. But nope, he's got to make it about his own inconvenience.", "Ignoring the advice of multiple people who know more than you is yucky.", "Reddit is brutal, I got called an idiot for my opinion on yogurt. I thought yogurt might be a safe subject but there is no safe subject on Reddit. Keep up the therapy, I\u2019m also a people pleaser. It\u2019s a protective mechanism deeply ingrained and it\u2019s not as easy to \u201cjust get over it.\u201d", "And people are asking if she was told what fitted MEANT.", "So if everyone were as \u201cSmARt aS YoUu\u201d they would know all about clothing.  I mean, I was raised around boats, doesn\u2019t mean I know everything about them.  It\u2019s not nice to call people dumb for not knowing things YOU think they should know.", "Psychotic thread where people are twisting themselves into rather believing that having a hat that fits your head is a niche topic for rodeo experts with special insider knowledge than admitting a 'hat fitting' is not a confusing concept.", "Also most people when they go get anything fitted are usually on their best behaviour. They think about how it fits when they\u2019re standing still not when they are head banging on a steer.", "But when you try on jeans, you can feel whether they fit right. Hats apparently have criteria beyond how they feel on your head. It's possible that the \"not blowing away\" fit is even uncomfortable--I'd love it if someone with experience would weigh in on that! It might be like trying on jeans and intentionally picking the ones that give you muffin top.", "I have a sombrero from spring break when I was a kid and a fez from a Doctor Who cosplay. Also the Indiana Jones fedora.", "Also the Mad Hatter's hat and wig from Disney.", "I think both things are the problem. She's petulant, and he's condescending.", "It just strikes me as some people are just mean to their partners when it would be less of a hassle for everyone if they were simply just nicer lmao", "Have you seen the transcript of the conversation between this man and his wife, supposedly containing all the lecturing and attitude and know it all attitude? I haven\u2019t. We don\u2019t really know the tone of what was said.", "If she didn\u2019t, she should have listened to those who did know better and told her to get it fitted.", "I\u2019m not calling her dumb for not knowing a basic thing. I\u2019m calling her dumb for not knowing a basic thing and ignoring the advice of those who know better.", "The one that didn't blow away left a red groove on my forehead when I took it off. it would not have occurred to me that it was a correct fit. I just wore it because it looked cool and didn't come in a bigger size.", "I wish more people over this side of the pond could tell if their jeans fit right, I'm sick of middle aged belly sticking out over the top of skinny jeans. And that is mostly just the men.", "Was the hat really something she wanted, or are you into hats and bought her something you thought was cool? Because this is sounding a lot like the watch post from the other week where the guy bought his girlfriend a watch even though she doesn\u2019t like watches.", "Have you read his comments on here? They set the tone perfectly."]}
