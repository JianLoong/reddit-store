If these are just your assumptions, then YTA:\n\nThis could have easily been a misunderstanding - maybe the hat did feel fine and comfortable while she stood still in the store (most wouldn't immediately jump to how well it would fit during super bad, windy weather), maybe she didn't know that getting a hat fitted would keep it on so tightly, etc. But instead of communicating properly from the get-go or asking her about her reasoning behind why she did what she did, you decided to tell people on reddit in the hopes that they'd back up what you\u2019ve already convinced yourself. Even if she was being a people pleaser, there's no reason to be so hard on her? Why rub it in her face when you could easily smooth things over by not focussing on what mistakes she made? Just say that its too expensive or something.\n\n She wore her gift outside because she loved it, it blew away due to a minor fault of her own, and you immediately got judgemental instead of showing any sort of compassion for the sentimental item she just lost. It's not all her fault (in the end it was the weather that screwed you guys over) so why are you so desperate to blame her? It's not like she left it on the ground and forgot where it was. If you treated the whole thing like it was an accident and explained why you didn't want to pay (beyond saying \"pay yourself\" or \"i told you so\"), she probably wouldn't be as mad. \n\nYou really aren't obligated to replace the hat at all but the way you go about this whole thing makes YTA.
