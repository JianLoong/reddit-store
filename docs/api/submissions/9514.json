YOU are experiencing the emergency. \n\nTake that money and invest it wisely for yourself. You don't know what will happen in the future. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you don't owe them anything. You were a tenant, and it's bizarre that they want to to give them house money when you'd obviously like to buy a house yourself one day.", "NTA. Find your own place and slip away in the night. Your parents turned into cockroaches after saying what they did.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, losing a spouse is hard enough.Trust your gut. The comments your mother made are horrible. You owe them nothing. That money is for you and your future.", "I am so sorry for your loss and I hope you will seek your the support you need.\n\nAs for your parents, you owe them a hearty thank you for their assistance and for being there when you needed them. Perhaps a token gift for having put up with you and hubby, etcetera. Their mortgage, however is not your concern. What a bizzar thing to say to your daughter. Your late husbands gift of insurance is to benefit you and your future and not your parents future. \n\nI hope you seek financial advice. Be well and again, i am sorry for your loss.", "I'm worried the \"price of freedom\" might be in relation to freedom from the husband. In which case, they never deserve to hear from OP again.", "PLEASE", "Price of OP's residence at the house = rent, utilities and groceries, plus she paid off her dad's car, therefore PAID IN FULL ALREADY\n\nOP's \"freedom\" = PRICELESS\n\nDisentangle yourself from these folks OP. You loved your husband dearly and they... didn't.\n\nFind yourself a cheap place to live while you get your head together in peace and think about where you want to buy a house. Hopefully more than a few hours' drive from your parents' home.\n\n**Never discuss your finances** \\-- and especially the amount of the insurance payout -- with any family members again. It's totally gross, but some people regard a spouse's inheritance as windfall money, like winning the lottery, and they get greedy and envious. It's awful but it happens, as you've seen.\n\nFinally, as a fellow widow said to me: \"Welcome to the club nobody wants to join.\" My condolences on the loss of your husband, honey.\n\nNTA", "This!!!!  Absolutely this.\n\nThe price of your freedom is an Uber to get you to a hotel or an Air B&B tomorrow.  Pack tonight.  \n\nDo not under any circumstances give your parents one cent more than you've already given them.  Your husband wanted you to have this money, please keep it.\n\nI am so very sorry for your loss.", "Lost my partner/children's father and his payout went to the kids only. Made some investments for them and they will be set when the time comes.\n\nThe amount of people who have said 'oh they're so lucky to have this'....pretty sure they'd prefer their dad asshole.", "This !\n\n\nUnderrated reply.", "Absolute this - see an adviser. They will give you an objective view and help you put the money towards long term use.", "That's sound advise. Be prepared for things to get uncivil and be happy if things turn out better. I did the other way round and had to pay a lot for the learning curve.", "No, don't even consider this even if you are the only child. \n\nThe house may be sold to get a parent into a nursing home or sold after they die to repay medicare that was paying for a home.\n\nThey could also choose to leave the house to some random person they met just recently.", "Ohhhh I took it as her price to be able to leave the house. \n\nBut maybe they were referring to him dying as her freedom. \n\nI can\u2019t pick it now. I see it both ways. \n\nEither way OP needs to move straight out and lock that money away where they cannot touch it.", "That was how I understood it too, which means her parents are vile.\n\nOp is NTA but needs to get out of that house. Immediately.", "This is what I thought too", "That\u2019s awesome. The price of your freedom is an Uber. The best ever.", "I was really in N T A camp until I read your previous posts.  \nNow I don't know what to think about either you or your family so no judgment.  \nI think you really need to work on yourself a lot. Good luck.", "NTA - Your parents are unbelievably entitled. You need to move out ASAP, luckily you have the means to do so.\n\nYou owe them nothing. Parents take care of kids - that's generally the direction of assistance. That doesn't mean there isn't room for the reverse in certain circumstances, but this is definitely not one of them. Ask yourself - what would your husband want you to do with this money? \n\nPut that money into an account that your parents do not have access to. Use some of it to establish your own housing - ideally, buy something so your housing is taken care of permanently. But while you wait to buy (or rent long-term) move into a nice motel or other short-term situation. And perhaps take a relaxing vacation somewhere to decompress from the last year.\n\nGet out of your parents house. Get away from their entitled bullshit that's making you doubt yourself.", "NTA you don't owe them any money and any decent parent would want their child to use that money to secure their own future. Go buy a nice place somewhere quiet where you can try and heal. I am so sorry for your loss and wish you all the best.", "Nta. Go buy your own house.", "You paid rent. You don't owe them anything. \n\nNTA", "NTA!! You would pay off their mortgage and then what? \nWould your name be added to the deed of the home in case they passed? \nYou would be left with no future.", "NTA. They treated you like a tenant. Tenants can move out. And if they wanted 300 000 from a tenant, they\u2019d need to go through the courts. Don\u2019t pay them.", "Nta. You have been paying what you need. Take the money and run. Cut them off.", "Your idea of giving them some of it isn't going to work the way you think! \n\nUnless you give them all of it to pay off their mortgage, they'll still complain and say its not enough. You've already paid rent, you should not pay them anything further. You will not get the outcome you think. \n\nUse all of that money to get yourself situated in a new place. NTA.", "NTA\u2026pay off their mortgage?   Are they crazy?  Sorry, but this may damage the relationship, but I would move out asap. You do not owe them \u201ctheir\u201d mortgage.   Hugs.", "No. You already pay rent and paid off the car. Do not give them anything!! Go buy your own home far away from these horrible people!!", "Same. \nSaw OP history post. Made me rethink.", "Be prepared for things to get uncivil and be happy if things turn out better."]}
