Best to keep your finances on a \"need to know\" basis and there are very few people who need to know your situation.\n\nFriends of mine were in a freak accident over 20 years ago. They had permanent, life-changing injuries and, four years later, received a seven-figure legal settlement. As the case was settled out of court, there was no public record of the settlement. These injuries have caused pain and suffering, will require additional surgeries as the years pass and will likely result in an early retirement for both of them. Wisely, the first thing they did when they received this settlement was work with a trusted advisor to be sure their future and their child's future was secured. They used some of the funds to improve their life - got a new car, got a home better suited to their family and job locations - but nothing crazy.\n\nThere are exactly TWO people in their lives that know the dollar amount of that settlement - the wife's mom, who is financially independent and has no need of their money and me, a family friend, who also has no need of their money. They *specificially* never gave a dollar amount to anyone else, despite the many, many people who asked (the accident was reported in the media, so many people knew about it). Their pat response when people asked was \"Not enough to compensate us for our permanent injuries\" (a true and valid response). That shut most people up. Some would press, and they'd just leave it with \"We are legally required not to disclose that information publicly\" (actually true of one of the parties involved in the case). \n\nThey can only imagine the line of people with their hands out for one reason or another had they EVER disclosed the actual amount they received.
