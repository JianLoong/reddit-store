They used some of the funds to improve their life - got a new car, got a home better suited to their family and job locations - but nothing crazy.\n\nThere are exactly TWO people in their lives that know the dollar amount of that settlement - the wife's mom, who is financially independent and has no need of their money and me, a family friend, who also has no need of their money. They *specificially* never gave a dollar amount to anyone else, despite the many, many people who asked (the accident was reported in the media, so many people knew about it).

Losing a spouse is a painful and difficult process; I'm sure you are still grieving. \n\nYou did not sell yourself into indentured slavery by accepting your parents' apparent generosity.
