Both of us are quite busy and our schedules don't align. I work the day shift in a factory while my wife is a nurse who working the night shift. As you can imagine, we hardly see each other during the week and only have time for each other during the weekends.\n\nMy wife has a younger sister (27f), Alexis. Alexis was never interested in getting a college degree and spent the first 3-4 years after high school partying and hooking up with random guys. Alexis' daughter, Emma (5f) is the result of a one-night stand. From what Alexis mentioned about Emma's father, I gather he's a lazy deadbeat who still lives in his mother's basement smoking weed all day. Suffice to say he's pretty useless.\n\nAlexis has been a single mom working a dead end job. The pay is ok (\\~$50k) but she doesn't enjoy it and wants to do something more fulfilling. Since she can't leave her job, she decided to take certification classes on both weekend days to make it work. The problem is, she can't afford weekend daycare in our city with her salary on top of paying for her classes so she asked my wife if she could babysit. My wife agreed without even discussing with me. \n\nWhen she told me about it, she said it was only going to be for a few weeks. Those few weeks have turned into months and now there's no end date in sight. I'm really frustrated because I don't even get to spend any time with my wife at all just the two of us since she has to take care of her niece. Anything we do, we have to take her as well. I'm not blaming Emma because it's not her fault but this isn't what I agreed to when I married my wife. Whenever I bring up trying to help Alexis find other arrangements for Emma so that we can have some alone time, she dismisses my concerns because \"family looks out for each other\". So I usually end up doing my own thing on weekends while she babysits Emma.\n\nLast weekend, my wife's best friend from college was in town for one night and asked my wife to hang for an impromptu girls night. My wife asked me if I could babysit Emma for that night but I said absolutely not. It's not that I can't do it. I've babysat Emma before when my wife needed to go to the doctor or run some errands. But it's the principle. She can make arrangements to hang out with someone she hasn't seen in years but she can't do the same for her own husband. She begged and pleaded but I stood firm. She eventually had to tell her friend she couldn't make it.\n\nShe's been mad at me for the past week and called me a shitty husband. I laughed her off and told her she treats me more like a roommate than a husband. We don't do anything spontaneous. We don't do any weekend road trips the two of us. We can't even have sex. My brother told me I should have just sucked it up for one night but my wife needs to learn that she can't just take me for granted.

And why people keep assuming he doesn't want to have kids? I would NEVER agree to babysit someone's kid for months (unless the person is sick) but I would love to have my own kids. \nThis is not about the kid, this is about agreeing to do something every weekend for unlimited amount of time without asking your partner first.\nNTA", "She made a choice that she should\u2019ve discussed with him first - absolutely. Doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to be punished for it.\n\nAnd he also has absolutely no time for her either since he refuses to hang out with her and the kid because he resents her.\n\nHe has every right to be mad at her. Hence the ESH judgement. But the solution is to discuss it (and maybe counselling if the resentment has grown so much). Not punish her and be petty and have no compassion for his wife who is just trying to be a kind and loving sister and aunt.", "I focused on a couple of things in your original message. The first was your judgement of your SIL. The second being the sex comment. And the third being that Emma isn\u2019t your responsibility. Those are three separate things. Not one word. \n\nI suggested couples counseling because you do not feel like you are your wife\u2019s spouse anymore, and she feels like you are a shitty husband. Having an intermediary would help bridge the gap. That\u2019s all.", "I said Emma wasn\u2019t his responsibility. So idk why that\u2019s up for debate. Also couples coinciding would help with those issues that he is feeling as well as her concerns. Idk why eating a sock is necessary", "OP, you're NTA as your wife didnt sound out for your agreement before agreeing. But there are few points to consider:\n1. In the event you guys do have kids, this will be your lifestyle. So this is really a good experience for you to know how does it feel like to be a parent.\n2. Though you may NTA for not agreeing to babysit for that one day, but you will be the bigger man if you agree to help out just that one or two times, with the emphasis that she shouldnt take you for granted.", "Plus, all that happens after a nine-month period of adjustment for you both.  And, ideally, both of your agreement to start the process in the first place.\n\nNTA, OP.  You didn\u2019t make the commitment, your wife did.  But it sounds like maybe some counseling is in order, purely to help y\u2019all learn to communicate.  It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of - I truly think that all couples should do a little counseling in the first year or two of marriage.  I think it might save a lot of heartache later.", "It's not that he can not \"handle\" a kid for a night. \n\nHe can, but he doesn't want to. \n\nIt's that he doesn't want to \"handle\" a kid that is not his for a night or at all. \n\nHe wants to spend some fun time with his wife. \n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know. \n\nI would have left a spouse who didn't pritorize me at all. \n\nHopefully,  OP will rethink this marriage and run far far away.", "See, your choice of words makes me feel you need counseling to make the conversations effective. \"Affecting MY life\" turns things into you against her versus being a couple/unit/team against the world/problem/etc. She may see this as you attacking a thing that she sees as being selfless, family-oriented, etc, while you aren't necessarily meaning to attack the action, but the problem arising from the lack of alone time. It still seems to be a communication issue, and if she isn't interested in counseling, it would point to her feelings toward your marriage and, more specifically, her lack of care towards your feelings.", "That is a little rash, without knowing exactly what was said and how it was said. There are many ways to broach a conversation about his feelings for this issue, and many ways it could end with her telling him, \"Family helps family.\" To assume that what he interpreted from the conversation means she doesn't value him at all, is just that, an assumption. One conversation about a milder topic (i.e. not cheating, irreconcilable differences, etc) should not end a marriage immediately. A thorough discussion, guided by an outside source (like a marital counselor), would be more indicative of true feelings/beliefs/etc. If she is not interested in discussing, then that again is more indicative of her feelings/level of respect for his feelings.", "So find fun things you can do that CAN involve the kid. What was your plan for if you have children of your own? Be adaptable. Show your wife some enthusiasm and take initiative. I have a stepchild. Is that what I expected? No. Can I do the same stuff I\u2019d do with my partner if we had no child? No.\n\nI got online and looked into stuff in the local area that all 3 of us would enjoy. We made a jar of adventures and we can pull one out whenever we don\u2019t have a plan for the weekend. I looked for boardgames and video games. (Yes, 5 is a little harder to accommodate than 8, but put some effort in, man! You\u2019re so supposed to love this woman)\n\nCook a romantic dinner that\u2019ll be ready after the child goes to bed. Yeah, maybe there\u2019ll be some need to get up and check on her or comfort her but never mind. The THOUGHT alone will be so meaningful and appreciated.\n\nWhat are you doing to encourage the emotional intimacy that would make your wife keen to figure out ways to work around the babysitting problem so physical intimacy can resume?\n\nJust refusing to help her and her sister out for a weekend as a form of petty revenge is shooting yourself in the foot dude, damn.\n\n\u201cSure honey, go see your friend and take a break. You deserve it. I\u2019d love to watch the Little Mermaid with my favourite niece. Will it be ok with your sister if I paint her nails?\u201d\n\nOR\n\n\u201cNo. Your trashy sister and her bad choices made that child and I won\u2019t babysit her because she\u2019s ruining my sex life.\u201d\n\nOne of the above guys is getting laid, and it ain\u2019t Mr. Grumpy, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.", "Can you explain how it is a compromise?", "Why not? Everyone needs a little help from time to time, besides never know when the sis will return the favor", "Seriously. So much about the story reads fake. \n\nLike why would they be watching the kid day AND night? Even full time university wouldn\u2019t have you in class all day, evening and night. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he spend time with his wife during the week after work? He\u2019s saying they literally never see each other, so what\u2019s going on then?\n\nIf she\u2019s taking classes, why isn\u2019t there a set end date? Why is the temporary arrangement be extended indefinitely?\n\nNot to mention the telltale signs of a classic reddit redpiller - unnecessary judgement of the sister\u2019s past (and yet, no praise for her apparent effort to improve her life with certification classes), comments about laughing in his wife\u2019s face, talking about being taken for granted though his post doesn\u2019t even show that (seems as though his made up wife in this made up story is happy to take care of things herself, so\u2026)\n\nAnyway, super fake post, but whatever \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This sub is dominated by women lmao what are you talking about? Men get shat on for all sorts of shit but the moment it\u2019s about a woman, it\u2019s fake and was made to \u201chate on women\u201d. As always, if this was reversed and a woman wrote this you\u2019d be calling the husband out.", "This sub has a huge bias in favor of women. I say that as a woman who tries to be mindful of misogyny when it occurs, and you couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Whether real or false, men in these stories are almost always judged much more harshly for their actions.", "Sounds fishy. She could be going to class. Or she could be partying trying to make up for the time she missed by having bastard child at 22.

Op seems like he\u2019s got some shit to work out with his wife.

It wasn't about how long I was supposed to babysit that was the issue", "No, I answered his question whether people here like their SO. I do, and it seems OP does. So yeah, I\u2019d try to talk about it. I\u2019d likely let her go on girl\u2019s night as soon as she got off the phone with her sister, telling her the next weekend we have plans", "You're acting like he shouted at her, punched a wall and stormed out.  He just refused to babysit.", "Breaking up is consequences. If you can find something smaller, it's better. The point is you can't just agree to everything, because you \"love them\" or you don't want to break up yet.", "He did say everything they do they have to take her,so he just ends up doing his own thing.There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting alone time with your spouse. I get wanting to help her sister cause I would totally do it but I would discuss it with my husband first and if we need a date night etc I\u2019ll find a babysitter", "I stated the facts about my SIL to highlight that my marriage is paying the price for her decisions.
