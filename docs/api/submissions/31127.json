On the other hand, your partner is going to want to vent about those stressors. \n\nYou don't need to coddle him, but it's not unfair that he's looking to you for support.  BUT he needs to have a way to decompress that doesn't dump on you.", "NTA\n\nHe's 40 and doesn't want the stress of a manager job but then finds out that doing the lesser-skilled job is crap in it's own way. Time for him to pull his finger out and retrain/go back to school for a more sustainable job as he will still have to work for the next 25-30 years, or to get another minimum-/low wage job but in a (totally) different line of work. Could do menial factory work, cleaning, gardening, sorting or delivering mail, delivering parcels or food, or could consider bus driver or lorry driver although this will likely require retraining.\n\nNTA for telling him that he chose this. Because he did.", "Nope. I have worked retail and that's exactly what it is. It's something I'll do when I retire from my corporate job but you need a thick skin to be in customer service. If he didn't know it would be like that, it's okay find something else.", "NTA. Also tell him the silent treatment is immature and abusive; communicate like a damn grown ass man.", "NTA it was his choice and he can look for something else. Nobody's holding him there hostage right?", "I never was a manager, just a server. When I left the service industry I knew I\u2019d never go back to that. Many restaurants are terrible to work at. How did he not foresee what it would be like? NTA", "YTA\n\nSounds like he was just venting and you were rubbing his nose in it because you didn\u2019t like his decision.\n\nIf this was his manager job and he vented about similar stresses at work, it would be mean to say it was his choice and he needs to suck it up.\n\nIf it\u2019s getting too much you can talk to him about not wanting to deal with negativity all the time because it also depresses you, but specifically rubbing it in that he needs to accept it because it was choice of work is just being mean.", "YTA. -living life together decade in and decade out, BOTH of you will make mistakes.  Yep, you will too.  You\u2019re human.  As is your husband.\n\nHow would you want him to treat YOU when you make a mistake or try something he doesn\u2019t really agree with ?  Do you want him to say, I told you so ?  Or by acting condescending with you and making you feel worse than you already do ?  Be uninterested in how you are feeling and just insulting you ?  \n\nProbably not.\n\nScience shows that marriages that have resentment or contempt fail significantly higher than those that do not.  You got both going.  Resentment because he didn\u2019t do the job you wanted him to take and now you have to tell people he\u2019s a server not a manager.  Condescension because you think you are so much smarter and better than him.  Resentment on his part for not feeling supported in something he felt he needed to try.\n\nIf you really feel like you are better than your husband\u2026maybe do both of you a favor and and really consider moving on.   Maybe Choose  a partner you admire and respect instead.\n\nMeanwhile, Better communication looks something like this\n\nHusband says I don\u2019t want the stress of being a manager anymore, I need a break and I just want to be a server.  Wife, wow, I\u2019m so sorry you are feeling so much stress that you no longer want to be a manager.  (Husband likely feels heard and valued). \n\nWife with apprehension in her voice, but I\u2019m nervous about how we will pay bills and manage financially with the big pay cut but I want to find a way for you to be happier.  Husband, yes I\u2019ve thought of that and \u2026.  Wife says, well it sounds like you have figured it out, great job, I feel better about our ability to cover our bills and want you to be happy !  Go for it with my full support.  (Husband feels strong and supported and understood and valued)\n\nHusband says being a server is not all I thought it would be, there are problems and stressors and I don\u2019t like it.  Wife, I\u2019m so sorry to hear it\u2019s not what you hoped, I know you can find something that\u2019s the right fit for you (inspiring confidence).  How can I help and support you ? \n\nIn the above - The husband feels valued, heard and free to figure out his life and what feels better for him.  He\u2019s madly in love with his wife and adores her for being so supportive and for letting him be autonomous and for making him feel loved and supported when he admits he\u2019s thinking he made a mistake.\n\nWhen you struggle someday, make a mistake or have midlife crisis issues, or something else, how do you want him to treat you ? \n\nKindness and love are, to me, the best way.", "NTA", "NTA You simply pointed out that he can\u2019t have it both ways.", "YTA", "How many beard's have you won?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
