The pay was crappy compared to serving plus tips (minimum wage is now almost $19/hr plus my tips, no tip pulling). I went back to serving after being the bookkeeper for 4+ years because it didn\u2019t pay me enough to live, let alone deal with all the problems that came with the position (I would get calls while I was on vacation at 10pm about payroll, I wasn\u2019t salary, I didn\u2019t get paid for those disturbances).\nYes, as a server you have to smile at people that are being rude to you, but like my mom always said, kill them with kindness, if they\u2019re going to complain their going to complain, no matter what you do. Don\u2019t give them a chance to say that you were rude. As a manager there is so much more that weighs you down, you have to deal with both the angry guest and an angry server. Being in either position has its benefits but they do take a toll and it\u2019s nice to have someone to vent to, but venting is venting. If it\u2019s become more than venting (infatuation or anger) then he should go back up to management so things run the way he wants them to. But I the mean time tell him: not your circus, not your monkeys. \nIf they\u2019re not following protocol or cleaning correctly, have him talk to the GM. If nothing is done and it\u2019s BAD, he should probably go work at different restaurant and tell him to anonymously call the health department. If they get shut down and he\u2019s still employed, he should get paid for a few weeks (depending on the state you live in).

The same way you shouldn\u2019t take personal problems to work, you shouldn\u2019t bring work problems home, especially if they\u2019re not paying you to do it. The only 2 people in a restaurant that should take their work problems home are the general manager and the executive chef. Everyone else doesn\u2019t get paid enough to deal with it\u2026 Have him repeat \u201cthis is above my pay grade\u201d when he sees something at work that doesn\u2019t meet his standards, manager or not..

Been a server and can tell you, it can have its good days but you\u2019ll need good tips to justify the 2-3$ pay per hour. We have countless stories about servers needing 2 jobs just to scrape by.

There may be exceptions, but in the majority of cases in the US, servers do NOT make more than management.  This is largely because in most states, servers are paid less than $4/hr.  There are states where this is not the case, but they are few and far between.\n\nThe most money I ever made as a server was in a fine-dining restaurant.  The last full year that I worked there (2019) I made $35k, and I was one of the top earners, because I was damn good at my job, and I worked my ass off--I usually worked 6 days a week, and worked occasional overtime... which is rare for a restaurant that usually only opens for dinner.", "It definitely is false.\n\n>A manager will make maybe 2-3$ more an hour\n\n$2-3 more... than the server's hourly wage?  Uhh... no.  In most states, that would not be legal.  In most states, server's, as tipped employees, are paid less than $4/hr.  Check your facts before you make these confident claims...

In most states, servers have a different minimum wage, which is less than $4/hr.", "It sucks the the US still uses tips to justify a servers wage. My partner is a server in Canada but they did away with that so now they make minimum wage ($16.55 where we live) plus tips. Working 4 days a week he makes more than I do working a full time mid-level job at a non-profit.", "There actually was a similar story on here like 6 months ago where a guys wife came home really negative every day and it made him miserable he got the nta verdict, so get out with your male victim complex of whatever", "You're getting down votes because you're claiming the beard typo is about something that actually has nothing to do with anything in this context.", "Why restrict yourself to US states and call someone confidently incorrect?\n\nAlso, don't the states mandate the restaurant owner make up the amount if the server is making less than minimum plus tips?\n\n>Employers can credit up to $5.12 per hour in tips against a worker's earnings. If an employee\u2019s wages (at least $2.13 per hour) plus tips is less than $7.25 per hour, their employer is required to make up the difference.\n\nSo the minimum is actually 7.25$ not 4$ in US", "Lol at the American that doesn\u2019t understand the rest of the world does things better then they do \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That sounds great. The minimum over here is still only $7.25. Even worse they count the tips for main pay. I worked at a fancy movie theater that had a sit in dining area. I worked as both a bartender and server, running food and making some of the salads. While good nights I could walk out with almost $300 dollars, they\u2019d use that to justify paying me $2.11. And while 300 is great for one night, there were more days where I got barely $20 in tips while still working 8-10 hours. It blows my mind these people are justifying it by saying we get paid more than managers. Sounds like the same Bs about pulling yourself up by the bootstraps.", "So you're claiming that restaurant managers outside the US make less than the servers they employ?", "Fuck off, I never said it was a good system.  It sucks ass.  Or are you claiming that restaurant managers outside the US still make less than the servers they employ... and that's somehow better?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
