The pay was crappy compared to serving plus tips (minimum wage is now almost $19/hr plus my tips, no tip pulling). I went back to serving after being the bookkeeper for 4+ years because it didn\u2019t pay me enough to live, let alone deal with all the problems that came with the position (I would get calls while I was on vacation at 10pm about payroll, I wasn\u2019t salary, I didn\u2019t get paid for those disturbances).\nYes, as a server you have to smile at people that are being rude to you, but like my mom always said, kill them with kindness, if they\u2019re going to complain their going to complain, no matter what you do. Don\u2019t give them a chance to say that you were rude. As a manager there is so much more that weighs you down, you have to deal with both the angry guest and an angry server. Being in either position has its benefits but they do take a toll and it\u2019s nice to have someone to vent to, but venting is venting. If it\u2019s become more than venting (infatuation or anger) then he should go back up to management so things run the way he wants them to. But I the mean time tell him: not your circus, not your monkeys. \nIf they\u2019re not following protocol or cleaning correctly, have him talk to the GM. If nothing is done and it\u2019s BAD, he should probably go work at different restaurant and tell him to anonymously call the health department. If they get shut down and he\u2019s still employed, he should get paid for a few weeks (depending on the state you live in).

The same way you shouldn\u2019t take personal problems to work, you shouldn\u2019t bring work problems home, especially if they\u2019re not paying you to do it. The only 2 people in a restaurant that should take their work problems home are the general manager and the executive chef. Everyone else doesn\u2019t get paid enough to deal with it\u2026 Have him repeat \u201cthis is above my pay grade\u201d when he sees something at work that doesn\u2019t meet his standards, manager or not..

Why would you assume I would be 'abrasive' with customers?  That's stupid.", "It's bullshit people use to make it seem okay to not tip.

There were plenty of nights that I only had one or two tables.\n\n>But I know the figure very well... because I sued my former employer.\n\nI think the other poster's point was more \"that's not the typical servers pay w/tips\". You definitely have your own experiences that are completely valid, but so are their's. And generally, servers really can make more than managers from tipping, maybe some don't, such as you, but others working in bigger cities or busier establishments serving multiple tables do. It also depends on experience, customer service skills, and multitasking skills. If I were a server I'd be struggling to pay enough for groceries, but my grandma would make $600-$700 from one good but super busy day. My dad would pull $300-$400 on the same day, and they worked in the same restaurant.\n\nI think you're both kinda right, but more so the other poster. But that doesn't discredit your experiences either.", "I'm sure many do yeah...servers often make more than lots of careers due to their tips (In many places, their before tip minimum is also the same as other jobs yet ppl still feel obligated to tip). It's also common for commission based jobs to make more than hourly. Plenty of friends made much more as servers than their current jobs as a professionals with University degrees\n\nAlso, like I said before - $7.25 is the actual legal minimum across US so you shouldn't be chastising someone else", "I wouldn't tip your ass. You're abrasive in general - you might think you're not, but you're not hiding it as well as you think.", "I agree people shouldn\u2019t have to tip on the basis that the establishment should be paying a livable wage, but that\u2019s another topic. Literally anyone who has been a server or similar know they don\u2019t get paid better than managers.", "You are ignorant as fuck if nothing else. If you are only making the federal minimum wage as a server then either your restaurant sucks (probably the bigger reason) or you suck at the job.", ">servers often make more than lots of careers due to their tips (In many places, their before tip minimum is also the same as other jobs yet ppl still feel obligated to tip).\n\nNo.  'Often' and 'in many places' are gross exaggerations.\n\n>It's also common for commission based jobs to make more than hourly.\n\nNow you're talking about something completely different that honestly has little to nothing to do with the discussion at hand.\n\n>Also, like I said before - $7.25 is the actual legal minimum across US so you shouldn't be chastising someone else\n\nNot.  For.  Servers.  So you should check your facts.  The *actual legal minimum* for *SERVERS*, as tipped employees, is fucking $2.13/hr, based on federal law.  It is higher in some (very few) states.\n\nThe most I ever earned as a server was when I worked in fine dining.  The last full year that I did so (2019) I made $35k.  And I was one of the high earners, because I was damn good at my job and I worked my ass off... usually 6 days a week, occasionally even overtime (which is pretty rare in a restaurant that usually only opens for dinner).  And this is in a state with a relatively high cost of living.", "Tipping culture tends to be very US base, I think. In Latin America at least, you might tip in a large table, but if the table spent 400 pen in food, you're getting 10 pen on a good day, sometimes only 5 pen. If 2 peopleare having dinner, sometimes my friend and I can leave 6 pen for a 60 pen check, but I've also seen couples that don't leave any tip. I've often read that in US \"20% tip is customary\", so for that big table that'd be like 80 pen and that's just not happening. \n\nPersonally I don't think restaurant managers make less than a server in my country, but now I really wanna know. I will totally ask around.", "Oh, I agree, the system is shit and should be changed.  But until it actually is changed, people who don't tip are assholes and are exploiting the system and its victims.  Yes, the employers are assholes too.  Doesn't mean asshole customers who don't tip aren't.  Two different people can be assholes.", "Yes. For. Servers.\n\nDid you not read my previous comment? The quote literally mentions tips\n\n>If wages and tips do not equal the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour during any week, the employer is required to increase cash wages to compensate.\n\nNo server is allowed to be paid under $7.25/hr, therefore the *actual legal minimum wage* is $7.25\n\nMaybe you should check your facts before chastising other people", "I think it's North American/Middle east based...\n\nIn Canada, it's the same tip percentage as US despite many provinces mandating same/almost same wage for tipped employees as regular employees. For large tables, the customary tip is sometimes mandated at 18% min\n\nIn terms of manager vs server...managers can often be salaried which means unpaid OT so the hourly rate could easily end up being less...I think the best income is from bartending\n\nCommissions vs Salary despite seniority is a big thing in other industries as well"]}
