We're independent people, but we enjoy spending time together too. He's a night owl, and I'm a light sleeper. I can't sleep in no matter what I do, and I never nap, I'm not good at it anyway, and I consider it lost time in a day, and time lost with our daughters (9 and 10) and time that could have been well spent doing chores, playing, exercising, etc.\n\nMy huband LOVES to nap. He'd do it almost everyday. Besides, he sleeps in every morning on weekends and days off. I don't mind that much because I would also like to do it, if only I could. We used to take turn when I was still able to sleep in.\n\nHowever, that is on top on the napping. Even if I tell him to please go to bed earlier, to please not nap, especially when the girls are around, he just doesn't care. He'll nap anyway. He never gives in to my requests.\n\nToday's Christmas day. We had a party yesterday and we went to bed very late. I was exhausted. However that was about is usual bedtime (I go to bed 2-3 hours before he does). We managed to wake up at 9 a.m., which is awesome for me. We watched our daughters open up their presents and ate breakfast. I asked everyone if they'd like to watch a Christmas movie. The girls declined, preferring to play with their toys. Then my husband immediately went to bed. At like 11 a.m. on Christmas Day\u00ad. I'm beyond appalled. I can't even believe this. We could have played with the girls, watched a different movie or even anything he'd enjoy, clean up the Christmas mess, anything, anything at all, but no, he went back to bed.\n\nAITA for critiquing him, being mad at him on Christmas day, and for trying to control when he sleeps?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: ok, so you all have kids? Kids alone on Christmas Day with a father that doesn't care? PLUS the +- 104 days of the weekends throughout the year he spends in bed without spending time with them? I don't care that much that it's Christmas day, to me it's worse honestly, but if that were THE ONE time of the year, it would be ok. But no, he naps ALL THE TIME, not just today!

I've read your OP, plus your other comments.  You keep bringing up the kids.  Are they upset about not getting enough time with their dad?  It also seems like you have a picture in your head about how you want Christmas to go, but it's not happening the way you want it to.  As far as your kids go, they are 9 and 10 years old - they can play without constant direct supervision, as that seems to be a concern of yours.  From what you said, they don't seem to care that he is napping.\n\nIt also sounds like you are just fed up with your husband's sleeping patterns.  I totally get that, and if it is bothering you so much, maybe you should insist he see a doctor about his sleep habits.  Get a blood panel run, maybe a sleep study done, and see if there isn't something else going on there.  It could be multiple things.  Something like ADHD wouldn't show up on those particular tests, but it can cause dis-regulated sleep, and it can be very difficult to maintain a normal schedule.  Of course, there are other health issues, too, that can cause sleep issues.\n\nIn my house, I don't nap all the time, but I used to before my ADHD was treated.  The medication helps me to maintain a somewhat more normal schedule, honestly.  I also have health issues that cause fatigue.  The meds also help with the fatigue.  There are multiple factors in my case.  In my marriage, my husband is the early bird, and I am the night owl.  My husband has always been understanding about my struggles.  Plus, add raising a bunch of kids who never slept through the night until they were 3 years old.  It has become even more challenging to keep a regular sleep schedule.\n\nI would stop trying to control your husband's sleep, but I think if it bothers that much you should also insist on getting some medical tests run.  Also, if you are feeling like you are missing out on spending time with your husband, maybe see if you can schedule time with him every week where it's the two of you hanging out or having a date night, or whatever.  I think there are little things you can do that would make yourself happier without feeling like you are nagging or having a battle with him, or whatever.  And, maybe you should also get some medical tests run for your sleep issues.", "also stop assuming everyone that's disagreeing with you don't have kids, it's rude and goes against sub rules, your children didn't miss out on anything today just because their dad had a nap", "I'm the Mom and I had a nap today while my husband took the kids to the park. I was up early, did the Santa stuff, cooked and served Christmas dinner for 8 people, and then had a nap. My OH had a three hour nap yesterday while I minded the kids and got ready. Naps are little luxuries for parents of small kids. I'd be annoyed if someone napped all the time and didn't help out when they're up, but really naps can be needed. My parents and siblings are here and with all the Christmas stuff and my small kids all the adults have napped over the last few days", "NTA.

However, this is a pattern that means you have to shoulder more of the parenting duties. Because he\u2019s sleeping in, you\u2019re having to take mornings.

If there's nothing wrong with him though I can understand why you're annoyed.  Not only is it antisocial to you and you're girls, he's then presumably leaving you with all the work, watching the kids, cooking, cleaning and everything else, while he sleeps?

It's Christmas. If he can stay up late at night he can stay up for a few hours during the day to be with his family.", "Honestly, I think ESH here. \n\nHe needs to fix his sleeping patterns, if this is an ongoing issue (which it seems like it is), because it\u2019s getting in the way of life a little. He should have gone to bed at the same time as you. I\u2019m a night owl and would gladly stay up late at night playing video games, but me and my partner have a rule that we always go to bed at the same time (excluding odd weekends when I go out or actually am able to stay up late and play games without work the next day)\n\nThere needs to be compromise. Because at the same time, your attitude to sleep is not very understanding. Sleeping is not time lost, it is a necessary part of life and bad sleep can ruin everything.\n\nYou both need to meet in the middle here.", "YTA\n\nI love to nap too (every day) would hate anyone who would try to keep me from my naps. Your reasoning sucks and is overall very controlling.", "YTA.  First, if your husband sleeps this much you need to consider of he has an umtteated sleep disorder.  If so, this could cause huge problems down the road for his physical health.\n\nSecond, you and he clearly need to sit down and have an open and honest discussion.  Is he depressed?  Is he using sleeping as an escape from marital issues or family responsibilities?  A good therapist could help you sort these issues.\n\nThird, stop being jealous of your husband's ability to sleep and seek treatment for you own insomnia.  \n\nFourth, don't let this ruin Christmas for the kids.  My mom was always just nasty and angry about something every Christmas, all day, and it made Christmas horrible.", "NTA but this isn\u2019t a napping issue, it seems more like an issue of your husband dipping out to leave you with all the responsibility regularly and not just at Christmas. It\u2019s frustrating because you\u2019re tired too, but he\u2019s not offering you a break. He could help you clean up and then you could both take a break and still have family time.", "How long is he napping for? Right now I\u2019m thinking YTA because if I could nap every day I would. And yes I have kids. Yes I agree spending time with them is important but I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t need to spend every hour of the day with Mom and Dad.", "YTA. I've been laying in bed with my boyfriend for the past 1.5 hours while he takes a directly-after-breakfast nap. Holidays are for doing what you want/need to relax. It also doesn't sound like your daughters are yearning for his attention today?\n\nMy ex-husband used to police my napping so that I felt like I couldn't ever nap. So I stayed awake and cranky to keep the peace. That didn't work out.", "YTA. And yes, since you\u2019re going to ask, I\u2019m a guy, I\u2019m married, and we have two kids (now teens). I\u2019ve discovered as I age that after large meals I need a brief nap. I can fight it off, but the desire to sleep is nearly overpowering. I also can\u2019t sleep a full night at one go, so I nap for about an hour each day. My wife encourages this, because she loves me. Whereas you don\u2019t appear to even like your husband. \n\nYou are saying \u201cshould\u201d a lot in your (really aggressive) responses here. You clearly have expectations that are not being met. You are also making a lot of generalizations about men and sleep patterns and parenting, none of which are universal. They\u2019re just your opinions, but you\u2019re treating them like holy writ. \n\nHere\u2019s another nap story. My dad used to nap whenever he visiting his in-laws, because they were so toxic he\u2019d just check out.

I understand your husband's need to nap and how it can drive you crazy. Talk to him. How long does he nap for? I have to nap too and it helps me be alert for the rest of the day.

Then have him give you the same amount of time to yourself while he takes care of kids/house...etc.", "Sounds like he might have a sleep disorder. Needs to see a doc", "NAH.  I'm kinda in the same boat as you.  I'm a morning person with a night owl partner and a child young enough to need a lot of watching.  Its frustrating when you need more sleep, and yes your partner SHOULD be considering your needs not just his.  However, it is your responsibility to manage your own sleep.  Don't do things late in the evening or stay up past your bedtime if you know you can't sleep in.  Your husband can't do stuff like that for you.  Also, trade offs.  If I want my night owl husband to continue being present late at night when the child needs something and I have no more brain power, I gotta let him sleep in when possible.", "Nta /  and for all the y t a  the issue is Christmas Day, it is every day he naps he leaves everything to op to do. That\u2019s the issue. He is a parent and yeah it would be nice to have a break  every day but he is selfishly prioritising his me time over his family time and It it\u2019s not equitable at the moment. That said you picked the wrong day-  you knew he was going to do it so why pick the fight that day - because of unreasonable expectations that he would know how hurt you would be this day without you telling him?", "NAH. I have been married to a man like this for 30 years. It was not quite so bad when we were younger but it still peeved me sometimes - he\u2019d sleep 12 hours at night and still want a nap a few hours later when I was wanting to do something together. It still drives me crazy sometimes - but I learned to work around it and do what I want to do. Unfortunately it\u2019s just gotten worse now that he is in his 50s. I\u2019ve tried to get him to talk to the doctor about it, I\u2019ve sent him articles about possible problems and he says he\u2019s just an old man. Which is insane. Or he says that he\u2019s allowed to be tired because he works so hard - which can be tough to hear when he only works 40 hours a week and I work closer to 60 plus taking care of the house and kids, without much help because he\u2019s tired. So, I totally understand how exasperated you can feel.", "It sounds like you're upset that he's not spending time with the kids, the nap is just where that anger is focused. \n\nI firmly believe that if you love someone, let them sleep (I mean there are.obvious exceptions, but in general don't effe with people's sleep). But it sounds like you need to discuss the parenting responsibilities with your husband. I'm going to say NAH with respect to the question you posed because I think your question doesn't address what you're actually upset about. \n\nInstead of harping about his nap time, when he wakes up discuss with him that you are also tired and would like to nap but have trouble doing that because he's not parenting effectively and you have the lion's share of the work there. You also deserve a nap, and he should spend time with your kids.\n\nETA: my dad napped from the moment he got home, until dinner was ready. Then he'd nap until bedtime. Then he'd move from the couch to the bedroom and sleep there. He'd nap all weekend. He was an absent parent for years as a result and I had almost no relationship with him. \n\nHe also had a raging, untreated case of sleep apnea and  hypothyroidism on top of that. One sleep study and some bloodwork later he didn't need to nap constantly. Sounds like maybe a doctor's appointment is in order.", "I think this is one of those problems that isn\u2019t about the problem. Is it the nap, or is it poor parenting the rest of the time? If he gets a couple hours off to nap, do you get a fair share of alone time to spend how you like? To me, you sound burnt out and exhausted from having to do all the holiday magic stuff that comes with kids, are you doing it alone?", "NTA he choses to be absent every weekend instead of finding solutions that work for the whole family. I would be angry too.", "YTA he obviously has a sleep disorder and it's obviously not his fault you don't seem to like him very much plus your daughters were just playing with their toys i really don't see the problem with him having an extra hour and a half", "YTA! And yes I have a kid. And you need to fuckin grow up!", "NTA. If it were just Xmas day I would understand but it sounds like he doesn\u2019t pull his weight. Who tf zooms friends for hours several times per week when you have a wife and kids?", "YTA for blowing up over a nap, but from your original description and all of your comments is seems like there is a much bigger issue with your marriage than some naps. You don\u2019t seem to be at all happy with how your husband prioritizes his time (on the computer, zooming with friends, etc.) and have somehow picked out the sleeping late and napping as the problem. Those are side effects of the problem. For whatever reason your husband is prioritizing his needs/wants over yours and your kids\u2014not just today, but every day. There could be a health reason (mental or physical) or maybe he\u2019s genuinely avoiding you, but when you\u2019re not angry you need to sit down with your husband and have a real conversation. Offer to find a therapist for him and make the appointment, offer to go to marriage counseling, whatever it takes, but make sure you do not come from a place of anger or laying blame because that won\u2019t get you anywhere. Then, depending on his response, you need to make a decision about what you want for you and your kids.", "YTA. It kinda seems like you don\u2019t really like your husband and feel like he\u2019s failing you as a partner. The naps may not be the issue here.", "No judgement but, I think you're getting flack because you asked the wrong question. Your husband is neglecting you and your children by spending all of his free time either on his computer or sleeping. When he's not at work he's responsible for 50% of the child care and 50% of the chores. Maybe instead of harping on his sleep schedule, focus on him pulling his weight in those areas?", "YTA I even nap on Christmas It's the best part all of the kids watch a movie or playing with thier toys and we get to nap. \nLearn how to deal with you being a light sleeper.", "I honestly don't think this belongs in an AITA post, honestly sounds like this napping issue is merely a symptom of a greater problem in your marriage, and honestly if you're wondering why people in this thread are focusing just in the napping, i invite you to re-read what you wrote, YOU focused almost solely on the specific nap he takes on Xmas, and then ranted things about your children that without context sounds like mere complaining. You can't expected people to get the whole picture like that. Especially by all the bad faith answers you keep giving in the comments that don't agree with you.\n\n\nFinally, as mentioned earlier, you and your husband seem to be having marriage problems, particularly about him not being present enough, physically or emotionally and you're latching onto the napping as the source of it, but let me tell you that if tomorrow your husband would stop napping altogether that still wouldn't fix ALL the issues you keep bringing up in the comments. You need professional help.", "NTA. As someone who has a husband who HAS to nap no matter what, I get it. It\u2019s annoying as hell. He needed to nap when our kids where babies, when we were on holiday, visiting family, you name it. Now your kids are a bit older so it\u2019s not so much of a hinderance to childcare duties I assume, but from what you\u2019ve said he\u2019s always needed to nap, so I\u2019m sure he did even when your kids were younger. Which means you had to take care of them without fail every single time. Just because you can\u2019t nap doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need downtime. I hope he compensates by picking up the slack in the house in a different department. Worst part is, if people like these don\u2019t nap, they get so damn grumpy and fussy like literal toddlers - it\u2019s easier to just let them nap. So it\u2019s a lose-lose situation for us. I wonder how they can sustain at whole at work without naps, but they absolutely have to nap at home, else they can\u2019t function.", "I\u2019ll go minority and say NTA.

We're independent people, but we enjoy spending time together too. He's a night owl, and I'm a light sleeper. I can't sleep in no matter what I do, and I never nap, I'm not good at it anyway, and I consider it lost time in a day, and time lost with our daughters (9 and 10) and time that could have been well spent doing chores, playing, exercising, etc.\n\nMy huband LOVES to nap. He'd do it almost everyday. Besides, he sleeps in every morning on weekends and days off. I don't mind that much because I would also like to do it, if only I could. We used to take turn when I was still able to sleep in.\n\nHowever, that is on top on the napping. Even if I tell him to please go to bed earlier, to please not nap, especially when the girls are around, he just doesn't care. He'll nap anyway. He never gives in to my requests.\n\nToday's Christmas day. We had a party yesterday and we went to bed very late. I was exhausted. However that was about is usual bedtime (I go to bed 2-3 hours before he does). We managed to wake up at 9 a.m., which is awesome for me. We watched our daughters open up their presents and ate breakfast. I asked everyone if they'd like to watch a Christmas movie. The girls declined, preferring to play with their toys. Then my husband immediately went to bed. At like 11 a.m. on Christmas Day\u00ad. I'm beyond appalled. I can't even believe this. We could have played with the girls, watched a different movie or even anything he'd enjoy, clean up the Christmas mess, anything, anything at all, but no, he went back to bed. \n\nAITA for critiquing him, being mad at him on Christmas day, and for trying to control when he sleeps?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like like your husband spends an unrealistic and unbalanced amount of time doing things just for him. I don\u2019t know whether your feelings are in response to that - that being forced to carry the parenting has made you sanctify parenting to the point of self sacrifice.

You asked if you were T-A because you critiqued him taking a nap on Christmas day, and frankly, yes, for that you are. \n\nHowever, the bigger issues at play here are that it's not just today, it's seemingly every day (in your own words, \"decades\"). And if your husband truly has sleep issues, then he needs to be seen and not have you passing judgement about how \"no one takes regular naps,\" as there are of course lots and lots of people that do, for their own health. And while you seem stuck on adults needing a very specific amount of time each night, you don't seem to understand that the amount of time differs for everyone, and can even differ by age. What your husband actually needs may be higher than you believe is necessary. He may suffer from sleep issues, he may not be getting good sleep the whole night, he may be suffering from depression, or he may truly be a jerk staying up too late. The place to start with that is again going to a doctor to see if there are reasons for his sleep issues. You keep saying he should just go to bed earlier, but that won't help if he can't fall asleep once he's there. \n\nRight now, ESH.

If it's that he's not pulling his weight regarding parenting and household chores, you need to say that. But having naps in the afternoon while your kids who are fully able to look after themselves for a bit play by themselves should not be a problem. If the issue IS the fact that he doesn't contribute at all, then you should say that, but since that's not what this post is about, I'm not sure why everyone else is jumping to those conclusions. But having naps and being a useless parent/spouse are not the same thing, so YTA.

I've read your post, your edit, your comments until now ... and many of the other people's comments to flesh this out.  \n\nI'm going to ask you to shush, for a moment, take a deep breath, compose yourself, and listen to an old not-perfect lady who's raised two kids to adulthood, and is still on her first marriage, coming up on 40 years, with the same not-perfect guy.\n\nYour husband's naps represent something much bigger than the surface issue.  \n\nIt is more than clear, from your own statements, that you are very resentful that your husband doesn't give you, or your kids, the attention that you feel is appropriate.  He complains about a messy house and such, but clearly doesn't give it his attention.  You clearly feel that the bulk of the slog work of a mature life, marriage and family, is falling on you, while he plays with his friends, late, like an overgrown teenager. You feel like you're living with THREE kids, and you have had enough, and are really angry about it.  Napping is the ultimate \"check out\" from life. He checks out on you, the kids, and his responsibilities.  Leaving it to you alone.  You are lonely. You feel alone with all of this. Meanwhile, you are clearly talking with him about it, which he wishes to avoid, so he checks out with a nap.\n\nA nap has become symbolic of checking out.\n\nChristmas is supposed to be about family time together, giving attention to your beloved ones. And he's checked out. Again. So today, it's even more frustrating.\n\nI understand.  I hear you.  I get it.\n\nNow. Napping on Christmas Day is actually quite normal, and you asked for a judgement on that, so you're going to get it, and you're not going to like it.  But the commenters all aren't getting it, are they?  It's about so much more.  It's symbolism for a much bigger problem - as some people have mentioned.\n\nSo.  You have a bigger problem to address.  Napping on Christmas Day is not a crime. You are not going to get validation from readers about this issue.  \n\nBut checking out on your wife and family, for years ... yeah, that IS a problem.  Behaving like a teenager, staying up late playing on a computer, and neglecting responsibility IS a problem.\n\nCouple's counseling has been suggested.  I honestly have no better solution for you.  This isn't something that is easily resolved with a Reddit post.\n\nWhat you are dealing with has been talked about, ad nauseam, and it's not just your own experience.  Many many many people have spouses or SOs who aren't fulfilling their needs.  But the answers can only come out of the two of you working TOGETHER to solve the issues, reconnect, and make your lives, together, more fulfilling for both of you.\n\nI send my warmest wishes that this helps sets you on a path to better happiness.", "YTA.

While I think YTA for trying to regulate when he sleeps, I think there\u2019s other issues here at play that are making you upset. \n\nMy husband loves to nap too, we both wfh and while my job requires me to be at my computer all day in meetings, etc, he has more flexibility. He always sleeps in until he HAS to get up for a meeting, and I often catch him napping on the couch during the day, and then again after we have dinner he will doze off in his chair again for a few more hours. \n\nI have a hard time sleeping at night (light sleeper) and wake up at 7:30 every morning, take the dog out, make breakfast, work, make lunch, work more, make dinner, watch tv and go to bed at 11pm at night. I, like you who is sleep deprived and exhausted but still pushes though and gets shit done, occasionally finds it frustrating that he can\u2019t get through a single day without napping. \n\nI hate it when I work hard all day have been up since the crack of dawn and when I finally get a moment to sit and spend time with him he\u2019s snoring next to me on the couch and I end up just talking to my dog the rest of the evening. It def makes me feel lonely at times. It also limits what we can do (even traveling we have to go back to the hotel so he can nap at least once a day, we never get to really enjoy fully and site see/experience a place). \n\nYou need to talk to your husband and make it clear that it\u2019s that he\u2019s napping, it\u2019s how frequently he is - he should go to the doctor to make sure he\u2019s ok. It\u2019s normal to not be able to get through a single day with a nap.

It just sounds like you\u2019re upset that you aren\u2019t able to sleep as much as he does, in which case YTA.\n\nTalk to him, set some expectations, and compromise on nap times and maybe some break times for you to get time to yourself.", "That edit makes me think YTA", "OP you are 100% NTA.

Why now after all these years of marriage is this a large issue? Also he could same the same about you for writing a very long post on Reddit when you could be doing something else. My husband and have the roles switched, he goes to bed earlier and doesn\u2019t really nap. I am very much a night owl and take naps. I would also recommend, like the other comments, that if your husband is sleeping too much that he may need to see a doctor for a possible sleep disorder, depression etc. I can personally say that I would sleep more when I was very depressed and I also sleep more because I have two different neuralgias that cause chronic pain. I think we need more information to make a more informed decision. However, since it sounds like you\u2019re ruining Christmas for everyone over something that should\u2019ve not been an issue or something you should\u2019ve addressed a long time ago more seriously with your husband, I\u2019m going to go with YTA.", "YTA Like you said, you both went to bed late and woke up early. The kids are playing by themselves. It's not like he turned down the opportunity to bond with them just to nap.

But you would have to be the only person I don\u2019t know who doesn\u2019t take a nap on Christmas. My son was up early. We opened presents, he played with his toys. Then we cuddled up to watch Charlie Brown and we were asleep. It\u2019s normal. Your husband is a grown man, you can\u2019t dictate to him when he sleeps bd doesn\u2019t sleep.

You say you were ok with his napping when you could do it too, but now that you can\u2019t it\u2019s suddenly unacceptable? That\u2019s the part that annoys me more than anything.

I have always been a night owl and my husband is not. Under normal circumstances he doesn\u2019t mind if I sleep in on a lazy weekend, he doesn\u2019t mind if I nap. However, with Covid times came extremes for me. I was staying up even later than usual to have some fucking alone time. Having everyone home (we have 3 kids) 24/7 was hell for me and my only escape was late nights. This turned into major sleep issues for me, especially when my depression got worse due to the pandemic and world events. I\u2019ve had to claw myself out of this hole with the help of a therapist, my psych meds, and my very supportive husband. I can\u2019t help but see myself in this situation.

If it's the naps, and he's otherwise a good dad and husband, well, get over it. There's nothing inherently lazy about napping. If you have other problems, address those like a grown up. If you are tired, sleep in another room if possible or use earplugs/eyemask if you can't. If you would like some time in the middle of the day to unwind, ask for it. \n\nBut ffs stop with the needy emotional manipulation. These are autonomous kids. They can absolutely play by themselves for Christmas. Get over the picture perfect idea of \"it has to be all family all the time\". My parents had that. One reason I no longer go to their house for holidays and likely never will. \n\nAlso, you didn't mention his industry or how many hours he works in a week. If its physically demanding or long hours, naps make perfect sense. \n\nThe lack of compassion here is telling. If a partner of mine slept a lot, I'd be wondering if he was low on iron or something and suggest he see a doctor. Why did that never occur to you, hm? \n\nThe fact is you are placing your opinions on the level of fact, expecting everyone to conform, and getting mad when they don't. That's not the way. Figure out what, exactly, is bothering you. Figure out how to be KIND in making REQUESTS about behavior. Be willing to compromise. \n\nIt honestly sounds like you need therapy but I understand that's not accessible for many now.

It's just oozing, and I'm reluctant to make a judgement without a lot more information from both parties.  At the same time that simmering resentment inclines me again towards YTA.  Resentment is anger at your partner, so you feel like you've got a right to it, but it's also the product of some issue going undiscussed and resolved and very frequently because it isn't actually being dealt with effectively by the person harboring those feelings, and really that's a failure on that person's fault even if it doesn't diminish or invalidate their complaint, and often it doesn't.\n\nI also find a lot of the justifications to be grasping at straws.  Coming up with other ways your spouse could spend their time doesn't make their choice invalid.  You can make the same argument about absolutely anything a person chooses to do with their time.

You essentially become a battery, how I see it is before the injury you were an Android battery, but after the injury you're an Apple Battery. Instead of being 100% when you wake up, your baseline is now 50% and every action you do, no matter how small, takes away a lot of battery life. Like before it would take like 2% energy to make dinner but now it takes 10%, and you need to rest and nap to recharge. It is not something you can change overnight and would for sure need your help with maintaining that battery life.\n\nIf it is not injury related, perhaps he has an undiagnosed condition. I saw one comment saying they had undiagnosed narcolepsy, and if this is the case for your husband he needs to go to the doctors to get a name to his condition and see if there are any remedies to help.
