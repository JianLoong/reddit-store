Now he travels the world and writes about it.\n\nThe thing, though, is that they did these stupid things for fun.\n\nThat being so, your husband is sad on a few levels.  Like, what is wrong with him?  He has a child working hard on a sports team (I also swam, so I know the work involved), and his first thought is to humiliate instead of support?  OP, is he jealous that his son does well or something?
