If he struggles to remember, just make a little laminated tick list of the essentials, attach it with a cable tie to the zipper or strap and try to get him in the routine of laying everything out next to his bag and checking that it all matches the list before chucking it all in. I have ADHD so I have to work extra hard at remembering things, and finding creative solutions to help me remember \ud83c\udf92 Your spouse might find it funny..but he needs to think of the ripple effect of his actions. You're right to protect your son from humiliation and ridicule. Being a teenager is hard enough without a public humiliation that will haunt him for years to come and put him at a disadvantage", "I\u2019m voting NAH, because I\u2019m hoping that your husband didn\u2019t mean harm, he just didn\u2019t think it through all the way. \n\nIt\u2019s a very funny Idea- my son would have totally found it hilarious and acted silly with it, at the end of 8th grade, when they were on top of the food chain. \n\nNow, as a Freshman, (just 3 months later) there\u2019s no way he would appreciate the joke- he\u2019d be mortified. \n\nIf it were me, and I knew my husband had a good heart, I would apologize to him for snapping at him, and then calmly discuss your thoughts on the matter. \n\nThen I think it would be good if your husband asked your son if he would have appreciated the joke, or have felt humiliated-it could really lead to a nice family discussion about jokes, and the in crowd, and navigating the social construct of school.", "No you\u2019re not the arsehole. \u201cTeach them a lesson\u201d is 99.9999% of the time just an excuse to do something bad, for fun", "I know, I am soooo cringy to my teenager!", "It's most definitely cruel because of the intention behind his action. The dad could've picked any towel, but he intentionally chose the pink unicorn towel because he assumed it would likely embarrass his son and \"teach him a lesson.\" Trying to teach your kid a lesson by publicly embarrassing them in front of their peers is extremely cruel and automatically makes you a shitty parent.", "The kids who are able to do that usually have good and steady social footing", "You claim this is all \"learned, cultural behavior,\" but how can you justify calling it toxic? What's your measure for determining that it's \"measurably unhealthy,\" especially when these practices are universally observed? Now let's look at some stark statistics about children brought up in single-mother homes:  \n5 times more likely to commit suicide  \n9 times more likely to drop out of high school  \n10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances  \n14 times more likely to commit rape  \n20 times more likely to end up in prison  \n32 times more likely to run away from home\n\n  \nThese aren't just numbers; they show the critical role a father can play. So maybe it's time you reevaluated whether your perspective is based in reality, or if you're just pushing a narrative that suits your viewpoint. \n\nHopefully, you're open to changing your mind when you see new evidence. If you take the time to dig into the research, you might find that men and women do parent differently in some fundamental ways. You could even come to see how important dads are in family life, rather than just labeling their approach as \"toxic.\"", "It's not abuse. Dick move but not abuse. It's extremely unhelpful to misuse the term abuse like this", "Uh . . . the easy access to guns might be another reason.", "People sticking up for kids is a good thing, but humiliation as a punishment for a child is a lousy idea.  The last thing this kid would get out of being humiliated in front of his peers is that he should remember his towel.\n\nIf Dad can't understand the consequences of his proposed punishment, thank god Mom is watching out for their son.", "I'm sad you went through that.  I hope it is well behind you and your life improved as an adult.", "Amen to that!  Well said.", "It\u2019s definitely affected me my entire life. Confidence issues, self image issues, trust issues. At least I now know that it was a problem with them, not with me. Even if knowing it and believing it are sometimes very different things.  \n\nAll in all, school was such a pointless waste of time. I feel it 100% stunted my growth both emotionally and academically. My biggest regret is not playing truant.", "What happened to you was terrible. I'm sorry that it happened. Bullying is not OK, ever. But not all teasing is bullying. I do think that your experiences of being bullied may cause you to view the unicorn towel as public humiliation or shaming, while my experiences of being teased but not bullied certainly cause me to view it as a prank that would elicit some low-level embarrassment and mild teasing, but nothing harmful. Like I said earlier, I don't think we have the required information to know what the likely outcome would have been in this particular situation.", "You are off base, Sorry Birthday.  \n\nI think LylBewitched was trying to inform people about the effects of bullying through sharing her own lived experience.  I thought it was well written and informative.\n\nAnd no, she was not projecting; she was sharing something about herself.", "We can't know for certain. But my view is that the risk is definitely there, so it ends up being cruel of a parent to set up their kid for that possibility. If he had close friendships with the other teens, then teasing is more likely. But as she said he's just starting to find his feet socially, which means bullying is a real possibility, and his parents need to keep that in mind."]}
