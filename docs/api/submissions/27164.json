Not defending the pink unicorn towel choice. Just explaining it isn\u2019t a pattern of similar behavior\u2026.which was part of my confusion and wondering AITA.", "[deleted]", "Put a note not to forget to pack his towel along with the towel", "Yeah cause I am sure you are experienced in relationships.", "So the only thing that makes it not cruel is that someone else intervened?  That doesn't change the intent at all.  Father is a massive AH.", "And I have seen kids get bullied relentlessly for the smallest thing, so I\u2019m not sure what your point is because you have a friend who wore a princess costume. Why stress a kid anymore than they already are?", "Yes if someone imagines a terrible pattern of behavior, sure there could be a big problem here. In this case - great spouse who is a great dad. Not a mean guy and I have high standards for this. He knows I put this on Reddit and I shared the votes thus far.", "Its not cruel because its a harmless joke.\n\n\nIt also hasnt happened either but was merely proposed", "Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing. In Australia, kids at my school are almost never bullied about a costume, let alone a towel. Again I still know OP is NTA but it\u2019s not going to leave mental scarring", "Yes that\u2019s what you should be thinking. Take Reddit with a grain of salt because ultimately it\u2019s your relationship and you and your spouse know best :)", "Bruh ur dense", "I'm not from the US and a kid once pushed me off a ledge for being a 'lanky bitch'. I fell 8ft onto concrete and needed stitches in my head. Because someone thought I was too tall.\n\nI have physical scars from bullying and my story is not unique. I'm glad you grew up attending a safe school. But please don't assume everyone is so lucky.", "I don\u2019t buy that, I\u2019m from Canada so it\u2019s not an American thing, it\u2019s a teenagers are ruthless thing.", "Bruh ur soft", "I\u2019m sorry that happened. You are probably right that most schools still have vicious bullies.", "Yeah it's called being nice", "No. one can be kind and not have meltdowns over the suggestion of a harmless prank.\n\n\nAlso you started the exchange with an insult. Thats not very \u201cnice\u201d now is it."]}
