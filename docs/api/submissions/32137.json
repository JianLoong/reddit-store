There's a reason why interpreting is a qualified job. I'm a professional translator/interpreter and I've done a lot of work in hospital.\n\nOnce, a nurse insisted that she spoke enough French to assist during a French patient's surgery under local anaesthesia and actually kicked me out of the operating theatre. The poor man's blood pressure shot up dangerously because he couldn't understand a word of what she was saying, and on top on it, she wasn't actually assisting the surgeon the way she should have. She got a stern talking to from the surgeon and I was eventually called into the operating theatre to help calm the patient down.\n\nLong story short, I'm in no way implying that you don't speak Spanish well enough. But  my point is you have other duties, and as I said, interpreting is a qualified job for a reason, especially in matters of health and safety.", "Medical legally you\u2019re not allowed to unless you\u2019re a certified translator.

You absolutely would deserve to be paid more for doing that but even like that you may not want to and it would be understandable.", "NTA. You're not qualified to be a medical interpreter, you're doing exactly what professional interpreters train medical professionals to do. \n\n>I never agreed to - otherwise I would\u2019ve asked for a raise \n\nYou really shouldn't even let them pay you to do it unless you're specifically hired as an interpreter. If you interpret something incorrectly it could have serious effects on the patient, and you don't want to deal with that kind of liability. \n\nAlso just a bit of pedantry but interpreting is spoken and translation is written text.", "NTA\n\nYou're not being paid the differential for doing those services. You speaking to the patient you're working with is very different from completing specifically translation tasks. As you said, there are already people on staff who ARE coded and paid to do so.\n\nYou **aren't** qualified, because that's not your job title. If you think about it, your Spanish language skills have not been confirmed by your employer, and it would put the patient at risk to have information be translated improperly. :)", "NTA.  Talk to your supervisor about how to handle these requests.  I bet there is a massive liability issue with an untrained, unlicensed, uninsured interpreter working with patients outside the scope of their job.  Get their answer in writing, even if that is a follow up email clarifying their position after the conversation.  You are unqualified, but then you can say 'I am not allowed' and it becomes your supervisor's fault.", "NAH\n\nI also speak another language and most people don't understand how difficult interpretation actually is. Simple interpretation is okay, but more complicated ones, especially ones that involve special terms such as medical terms, it's hard to interpret because I don't know what's the proper word in the other language", "Nta tell these nurses you aren't trained for medical translations and to call the translator.", "NTA - some people don't understand how taxing translating can be. It's a completely separate job. Plus, you aren't certified to translate medical terminology.

At my job, we have translation services available , but we get a 10% raise for being bilingual. If they want to use your language skills then they need to compensate you appropriately. If you coworkers don't like it then they should consider learning some Spanish. It's not fair for you to have to do extra work that your coworkers don't have to do.", "NTA. Look you can speak Spanish (or any other language) all you want, but unless you\u2019re trained to do so i wouldn\u2019t go around translating medical information.", "I was a pharmacy technician, I know some French. The rules are we were expressly forbidden to even attempt to translate for patients, it is crucially important that only actual, trained translators do that.

If they are calling to confirm a followup appointment,  go for it. It's teamwork. Anything other than that is a hard but polite no.", "NTA. Tell them that you're not fluent, only conversational. (It doesn't really have to be true, we're just trying to shut them up.)", "This is a question for your boss and the laws of your jurisdiction.\n\nWhere I live, medical translators have to be medically certified to do this, which means be paid more.", "NTA.  If the company is willing to pay you to translate, that would be a different story.", "NTA only because you're not getting paid. Being bilingual is a skill that is often taken advantage of by companies. But if they have translators on site they should be asking them (if I read your post correctly, looks like they do?) If there's any other reason why you're not willing to translate, YTA. This reminds me of going into offices, banks, etc, with my mom as a kid and the Spanish speaking receptionists and workers refusing to speak Spanish to my mom because they thought it was funny/simply didn't want to/said she should speak English.

I wouldn't want to work with you. You sound like one of those, \"It's not in my job description\" people. In a work environment, you have to be a team player, but some people only care about themselves. I prefer team players who  help others.

Such a simple, kind thing to do, yet it comes with a price tag.  YTA\n\nEdit:  For all those jumping on me about my opinion - OP didn't say she was incapable  of interpreting (professionally) but made it a point that she wasn't getting \"paid\" to do it (as part of her job).  I am the type of person that goes the extra mile.  If she doesn't want to interpret, it's her choice, it's not her job, I get it - but don't ask if YTA for not doing it - IMO, when you have an opportunity to help and/or be kind - help and be kind.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also (and I know I don't have to tell you this), MAs have more than enough to do all the time. I am not sure if anyone in a clinic works as hard as MAs do. In that vein, you do not get paid to take on additional tasks like translating and you shouldn't have to.", "NTA Where I work you wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to translate unless you pass a test for it, and in that case, you would also be paid extra for it. We have two levels of translation that people can test for. One is just simple translation like for setting appointments or directions or whatever, but medical translation takes a higher level. Your employer should be more rigorous about this.
