He did this without consulting me and promised to train the dog. Long story short, he never did train him. I did my best with a newborn and a puppy. He\u2019s not poorly behaved but has had spurts of behaviors that need corrected. I dealt with most of this and made sure he got exercise as best as I could, even if it was just time in the fenced in yard. \n\nFast forward to now, we are broken up. The dog is still at my house. He says he cannot take him. I full have custody of our kids, plus caring for my dog and his dog and I work full time. His dog is very high energy (he\u2019s about 5 and still puppy level energy) and requires a lot of grooming. My dog is low maintenance for grooming and a bit older so less demanding energy wise. \n\nI mentioned to a friend that I was considering rehoming my ex\u2019s dog. I found a family that had two other of his breed, and they seem great. They\u2019d be able to do all the dog park stuff and long walks and grooming care that I struggle to maintain. My friend told me it would be selfish to rehome the dog. And that I should stick it out and do my best. And that it would teach my kids it is okay to shirk responsibility and treat animals like an object. They said it\u2019s not fair to the dog or the kids. I\u2019ve been trying to make it work for over six months and I\u2019m overwhelmed. No animal or human is getting their needs fully met in my opinion because I\u2019m stretched too thin. \n\nMy kids do like the dog. But are less attached to him than they are to our older, slower dog because he\u2019s easier to play with at their ages. \n\nI guess I might be the asshole to rehome the dog because it could upset the dog and my kids and it would teach them a bad lesson about responsibility. \n\nTL;DR my ex and I split and he refuses to come get his high energy and high maintenance dog. I can\u2019t manage being a single mom with a full time job plus caring for two dogs.

Perhaps take it to meet the other dogs for a few visits before making a firm decision, just to see the dynamics.", ">My friend told me it would be selfish to rehome the dog.\n\nYour friend is wrong. You have examined your situation and have realized this dog needs more than you can give it. You then found a good home that can give it what it needs. \n\nWhat you're teaching your kids is to be responsible for any dog they have...sometimes that looks like knowing you aren't the best fit and then finding another home that is.\n\nYWNBTA for putting the needs of the dog in front of what your friend thinks. She is ridiculous, btw, and clearly is blind to what you are going through.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is wrong.  You're a single mom and don't have time for high energy dog.  It's more humane for the dog to go to another home that can give him longer walks and the extra grooming.", "NTA.  This is not your dog, it is your ex's dog.  Message your ex that you are unable to continue caring for his dog in addition to caring for his children, etc.  Tell him that you are going to rehome the dog.  If he doesn't like it, he can come get the dog.  \n\nSit down with the kids and explain that doggy is going to another family  that will take good care of him.  It is not showing kids that it is ok to abandon a \"family member\" (this is actually what their sperm donor did, not what you are doing). What you are doing is showing that is ok to know your limits and ask for help when you need to.", "NTA. You sound like you will be a great parent for your kids and take great care of the dog.\n\nWish you the best.", "NTA. You're putting the dog's needs first by rehoming to someone with the experience and time to give it a better life.", "NTA\nYour friend is an idiot. If you cannot care for the dog properly then thw beat thing for everybody is to rehomw the dog.  Doing so teaches your children that animals deserve love and care and if you can't do it proper you don't get an animal or if you have one you give them to somebody who can.", "NTA. Rehoming is the best thing you could do for the dog. You\u2019re stretched too thin and I think it would be best for everyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not selfish to rehome a dog you can\u2019t properly care for in favor of sending it to a home where it CAN get proper care. \n\nAbsolutely do what is best for you and your kids so that both them and the dog are happiest and healthiest. You can teach them about personal responsibility by showing them to recognize their limits and following through with a thoughtful rehoming process.  This is absolutely going to be better for everyone involved as long as you do your due diligence and rehome the pup responsibly.", "NTA - you are doing the responsible thing for the dog.  Finding him a home where the humans understand his breed and are prepared for the grooming responsibilities.\n\nYour \"friend\" is the one being selfish.  The dog deserves more of a life then you can currently give him.", "NTA you are making sure that dog has all its needs met by rehoming it with someone who actually has time for it. Not abandoning it.", "NTA. It sounds like keeping the dog harms you and your family in the long run, and that it would be \u201cselfish\u201d keeping the dog in a situation where no one\u2019s needs a met. Rehome the dog to a nice family, and don\u2019t feel guilty! \n\nIf anyone says it\u2019s selfish, or that you are abandoning your responsibilities, ask them this: would it be better to let the dog stay in a house where his/hers needs can\u2019t be met, while also compromising with my children\u2019s need for quality time with their mother, just for the principle of not rehoming a dog I didn\u2019t decide to have?", "NTA \nIf you\u2019re unable to meet a dogs needs, rehoming the dog to a place where those needs will be met is not selfish. \nEspecially if you\u2019ve been trying for five years. \n\nI would inform your ex that he has x amount of time before you rehome the dog, so he has a chance to reclaim his dog and hopefully take good care of it. \n\nBut otherwise do what\u2019s in your and the dogs best interest.", ">it would be selfish to rehome the dog.\n\nYeah. Uh. It's selfish to keep a dog that you can't put as much time and effort into as you like, and it's not your dog to begin with. It's your ex's dog. He bailed on it.   \n\nNTA.", "That's how I got at least three of my dogs - all purebreds, but unwanted and no one could immediately accommodate housing them.\n\nI ended up being their forever home. And I have never wanted to rehome a dog. But, I know that this is sometimes necessary. So, rehoming a dog never makes you a bad person if your goal is to secure a happily ever after for the dog?\n\nNTA. Good for you. And good looking out for that dog. I have no understanding of people who think rescuing a dog is a bad idea? And that's what you'd be doing - allowing someone who can care for him to be his rescuer. Hugs. I think your friend isn't being logical at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I generally think its a shitty thing to do to a dog but if you think you actually cant properly care for it, then best to get the dog to someone who can.", "NTA.  Your friend is an idiot.  If they don't want you to rehome the dog, how about they take it in?\n\nYou are a single working mom with kids, so one dog is probably almost too much. Props to you for holding it together with as much as you have on your plate right now.", "It's your choice at the end if the day, it's all about tolerance. Of course your kids are going to be more attached to the older dog, they've known him longer.\n\nTraining a dog is only as hard as we make it out to be, I'm speaking as a person who grew up around well-behaved pit bulls, a breed often bred to be aggressive. \n\nYet they were well-behaved and displayed the correct amount of energy around kids. Dogs also match energy, primarily thinking in energies themselves.\n\nSo, if you don't feel you can match the dogs energy or properly train him yourself, first, maybe consider a dog trainer.\n\nIf you can't meet the dog's needs yourself, no, I absolutely do not think you would be an asshole for rehoming the dog.

It's ridiculous to think your children will learn that you can \"shirk responsibility\" when you are on a daily basis showing them responsibility by being a single mom keeping a home for them. \n\nWhat you can do is teach them responsibility and kindness by saying- Dog has more energy than we can deal with, and found him a place where he will be happy with two of his friends- and that you took the time to find a place where the dog can actually thrive. \n\nI'd also highly reconsider how good of a friends these are. When my friends are drowning, I help them get rid of the weight holding them down, I don't suggest from the comfort of the shore they should be able to swim with all that is in their hands. \n\nRehome the dog and don't even discuss the issue with these friends. Let your ex know where the dog is going and again, no discussion. He can get the dog by X date or it will be with a new and lovely family (don't say who or where). You have enough going on without judgement and back and forth with your ex.", "NTA. This sounds like it would be great for the dog. You have enough on your plate as it is.\n\nYour friend though............seems to have a punishing personality. Where do people find these awful friends?", "NTA.

If so let the dog go and enjoy it\u2019s life.", "OP selfish would be taking the dog to the local SPCA. Selfish is your ex getting a dog without talking to you first, then leaving that dog behind and forcing you to take care of it. \n\nYou are making a good effort to find the dog a better place to live. You are a much more responsible pet owner than your ex will ever be.", "NTA. The advice about teaching your kids not to shirk responsibility is absurd -- they're too young to even know what that means. You're right in that it's not fair to the puppy.

They want to introduce their dogs to mine at a dog park and give them the chance to learn each other. Then I think they wanna do a trial week at their home (still ironing out details with them) to make sure he fits into their family. I\u2019m really hopeful he takes to them. He\u2019s a sweet dog.", "He knows about my effort. I have him a warning a few times and he agrees it\u2019s in the dogs best interest if I can\u2019t manage (but he did guilt trip about it impacting the kids). He has two dogs and only took his favorite and left this one behind because he only had space for one.", "I\u2019ve asked him multiple times. When I mentioned rehoming he told me to go for it.", "I definitely have a hard time calling him unwanted. I do wish I had the time and energy. And I\u2019ve tried very hard but it\u2019s breaking me. \nWe love him but he deserves better than I can give. I would never just drop him at a shelter or in the middle of nowhere. I\u2019ve actually rehomed two dogs that people threw out of cars near my home because I live rural and people just abandon dogs out here and drive away sometimes", "Sending a dog to his happily ever after forever home isn't treating the dog poorly, though. All but one of my dogs were rescues. They and I were blessed that they were given away.", "He is trained in basic manners. I made sure he was housebroken when I was nursing a newborn. He doesn\u2019t beg. He can walk on a leash and sit and stay pretty well. \n\nHe is a purebred. He was meant to be a hunting dog (whole reason ex wanted him) but he never bothered to train him for that purpose. So all those instincts kept turning into bad habits that needed to be redirected. He isn\u2019t a bad dog. Just needs better outlets which I don\u2019t have the time for really. \n\nA dog trainer isn\u2019t really in the cards financially.", "I would never drop him at a shelter. That is not fair to him. We are trying to be very thoughtful about his placement.

You're acting in the *dog's* best interests, too, so go for it, and I really hope it all works out.", "A happy forever home doesn\u2019t negate a poor first home. \n\nBy that logic an abused dog is good because it eventually goes to a good home? Come on.", "Yeah they do walks twice a day minimum. And bed time treats for their dogs. And the coat care vitamins and carrots/raw vegetables to help keep their teeth clean. They sound like wonderful dog parents (and I don\u2019t usually use the parent term for pets but like, they seem to demonstrate a ton of dedication to the care of their animals)", "I get your opposition personally. Implying it\u2019s a \u201cpoor home\u201d is a bit much. He\u2019s loved. He gets quality dog food, brushed as often as I can, has a cushy bed. He isn\u2019t on a chain in a dirt lot."]}
