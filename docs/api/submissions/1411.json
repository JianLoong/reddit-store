She's already fallen off the bed once and then lied about it.  I don't think it's uncalled for to discuss some concerns with him in a non-confrontational manner.  That's part of parenting and relationships to talk frankly and lovingly to your partner about some behaviors and come to a compromise.", "Based on the available info NAH. Parenting is hard. And different people are different amounts of \"hands-on\" and have different levels of concerns and it's not easy getting on the same page. \n\nDefinitely NTA for voicing your concerns. You guys probably have to have a lot of conversations and communication to get on the same page. \n\nAlso, he shouldn't have lied, but I don't think he's TA for that because I think he was being all conflict avoidant and trying to defuse the situation. I don't think that strategy of his is going to work out in the long run. Like I said, you guys really need to go through a lot of communication to get on the same page.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughter isn't made of glass, she's not as fragile as you fear she is.  She's not made of Teflon either. \n\nHow long does she cry for without him waking up?", "NTA - trust your instincts, but also, trust that he can take care of his own daughter, if you are truly worried about it, invest in a nanny cam.", "INFO: does he fall asleep with her out and about and not wake up, or just not wake up when she wakes up crying (and is in a crib)?", "NTA - maybe make it a rule that she's no longer allowed to sleep on the bed though. That he's to put her in her playpen or her bassinet so that if he falls asleep as well, there is no worry that she'll crawl off the bed and hurt herself.", "NAH You are just two really tired young parent. Don't be scared to ask for help, stay strong.", "He wakes up early for work, I work nights and don\u2019t get off till around 10, and then we\u2019re up late with our daughter because she\u2019s reverse cycling and he doesn\u2019t want to sleep and feel like he\u2019s not helping with her at night", "I\u2019m naturally a very anxious person, I usually think worst case scenario\u2019s for a lot of things! But prime example was last night, I suddenly felt awful and was throwing up for about 20-30 minutes, she was crying in her play pen for about 5 minutes loudly next to his side of the bed, and he didn\u2019t wake up, so I went and grabbed her", "Errrr if you get a nanny cam of course it's important to get your boyfriend's consent otherwise it might seem like you're trying to spy on him....", "He\u2019s done both, my fear is they will fall asleep together in the bed, she will wake up and he won\u2019t, and she will crawl off the bed", "I would say if he works early, he needs his sleep and you need to tell him it\u2019s okay to not be involved all the time. It will become more dangerous if this continues and he\u2019s not alert when he should be.", "She is in a playpen and safe. Crying won't hurt her. Hubby needs more sleep though.", "Have you sought treatment for you anxiety? \n\nDoes he take any sleeping sedatives or drink alot before bed?", "Yeah, he really can\u2019t fall sleep with a crawler if he won\u2019t wake up when he moves. If he\u2019s sleepy, he absolutely needs to put her in a safe place for her to be (pretty much a crib or playpen) before falling asleep. If he sleeps through her crying there, she won\u2019t die. But, it\u2019s actually possible she will if he truly sleeps through her moving and crying and she\u2019s just loose in the house (including on the bed).\n\nCrawling is a whole different level of vigilance.", "I was prescribed medication for anxiety before, but i\u2019ve moved so much in the past year that finding a new doctor and everything has been hard, and he doesn\u2019t take anything or drink, he hates both", "Speaking from experience seeing someone to treat the anxiety and retrain your thought patterns is more effective than medication. Anxious thought patterns are a learnable behavior which you could pass on to your daughter. \n\nIf your husband would sleep through a fire alarm your fear is well founded."]}
