My fianc\u00e9 and I kept our bridal parties small (4 people on each side) with mostly family and our best friends. I did ask my SIL to be a bridesmaid out of respect for my fianc\u00e9, though we aren\u2019t close and have a rocky history (she hasn\u2019t been the nicest and did not speak to me for the first few years of our relationship). Since then, she has been cordial and helpful in the planning process.\n\nI sent her 8 options for bridesmaid dresses to make sure she had something she liked. We\u2019re getting married in the south so it\u2019s SUPER hot so I made sure there were lots of different fabrics, lightweight, etc. She sent back one she liked and it seemed all good. Then I told her great, go ahead and order it! And she asked me if I wasn\u2019t ordering them and paying? I said no: my sisters and friend already ordered theirs, so feel free to order whenever you\u2019d like.\n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 about the convo and he asked why we weren\u2019t paying for them. He said he thought it was normal to cover the expense and his sister probably did too. He\u2019s also upset we\u2019re not paying for their hotel room for the night since they\u2019re part of the bridal party (sister, her kids, and BIL). We are paying for hair, makeup, nails, and $200 bridal party gifts each. We also gave gifts when we asked them to be in the wedding. Just for context, SIL did not come to bachelorette and is not contributing to the shower (my older sister is footing the bill). \n\nWe are middle class and I just honestly can\u2019t afford that. The wedding has already gotten completely out of control due to inflation and I am spending thousands just on hair, makeup, and nails. The dress costs $120 and I tried to send options with various price points. I definitely can\u2019t afford those hotel rooms (note that they live an hour away but prefer to stay at the venue). But my husband is upset and said his family is going to give him crap for this because they paid for everyone\u2019s when they got married. So AITA for not paying for the bridesmaid dresses and hotel rooms?\n\nEdited to add: my fianc\u00e9 recently got laid off (after we were locked into most of our contracts) and is currently searching for a job so 100% of the financial burden falls on me. Hence why things are tight and were not when we first started planning. SIL is also middle to upper class - they have enough money for private school for their kids but not money to blow, if that makes sense.", "created_utc": 1674689427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ld7ym/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_bridesmaids_dresses/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Buying your own dress is fairly standard for being a bridesmaid. Taking a quick look at an article on wedding etiquette it looks like you\u2019re doing everything right.

This is all getting out of control. \n\nI once paid about $150 for my BM dress and $200 for my room, and the bride paid for hair and makeup and nails AND jewelry AND little coach purses to match our dress. I\u2019m 100% sure she spent much more than I did, and 1000% sure I would have appreciated a free room to split with my other BM friends more than a periwinkle coach mini purse. \n\nThis has happened more than once, and I don\u2019t mind because I know the drill, but those gifts were a waste of money, and I had plans for those hotel funds.\n\nI had a friend get married right out of school and I liked the way her mom handled it: they paid for everything, but it was no frills. Dress, place to stay. That\u2019s it. You drag some shoes from your closet or walk in to Payless; you show up when are where you are told; and you help each other with hair and makeup.

And this expecting people to pay doesn\u2019t seem to exempt them from traditional duties like helping with favors/setting up/tearing down/dealing with vendors.  Sometimes the party would pay for their stuff if it was a budget wedding, but if so you\u2019d make sure they could *actually* use it again and weren\u2019t picky on the exact \u201clook.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say that was the tradition in my area until a good 15-20 years ago.", "Totally agree.

Like if we are at their house, they will order pizza then not have cash available and we end up paying. So I guess going out of our way to do this again is just annoying me more than it should (I know the expense isn\u2019t huge at all compared to the rest of the wedding).", "So to answer your first question, my husband said that I should also cover makeup and hair. I can\u2019t see how it wouldn\u2019t be a little awkward to ask them to pay for it themselves and since I would like everyone to get their hair and makeup professionally done if possible (of course however they want it done) I feel like it would be in poor taste to expect them to pay for that? Idk I read that on an etiquette thing online.\n\nAnd their hotel room specifically would be too expensive - they booked a family suite for 4 nights because a lot of family is in town for it and they want to hangout. They never mentioned us paying for the hotel room, they just went ahead and booked it and only my husband is saying this based on what they did for their wedding", "A family suite so they can entertain family for four days?

I don't think its unreasonable to ask a bridesmaid to pay for a $120 dress, but I do kinda agree with some people who questioned giving a $200 gift and not paying for the dress. Also, I want to point out that you basically said you included her out of obligation/ for your fianc\u00e9, and maybe she feels the same. Like she agreed just to be nice to her brother.
