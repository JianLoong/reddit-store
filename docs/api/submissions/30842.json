When he isnt at work, John is mostly in his room playing video games and doesn't really talk much.\n\nHe has a girlfriend, \"Rose\", (F21). We didn't know she existed until randomly one day she started living in our house a couple of months ago. She's not on the lease or anything. We don't share our food shopping and our rent is bills included so no one was really bothered about Rose living here.\n\nRose is unemployed and isn't in any kind of education.

She just sleeps all day and plays video games all night.\n\nI choose to work nights because it is an option in my job and it's better pay and I can really use the money.

This does make some noise (which I do try to keep to a minimum) and I know 5 or 6 is very early for a lot of people. This never bothered John or my other 2 roommates as they are either heavy sleepers or have to get up at this time anyway to go to work in the morning.\n\nRecently John has been complaining and said that I am waking up Rose when I get home from work. He says she's a very light sleeper and that I'm disturbing her. I suggested ear plugs but he said I should be the one to change my habits since I'm the source of the noise. He said I could at least spend less time cooking my dinner. I think this is unreasonable and it's not like I'm blasting music for no reason, I'm just doing basic things.\n\nI asked if it really was such a big deal, since it's not like Rose has a job or anything to go to and she can just sleep in later.
