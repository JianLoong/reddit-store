One was randomly assigned, the other two are friends from uni. The randomly assigned roommate is \"John\" (M24). When he isnt at work, John is mostly in his room playing video games and doesn't really talk much.\n\nHe has a girlfriend, \"Rose\", (F21). We didn't know she existed until randomly one day she started living in our house a couple of months ago. She's not on the lease or anything. We don't share our food shopping and our rent is bills included so no one was really bothered about Rose living here.\n\nRose is unemployed and isn't in any kind of education. She's similar to John and doesnt really speak to anyone. She just sleeps all day and plays video games all night.\n\nI choose to work nights because it is an option in my job and it's better pay and I can really use the money. When I'm working I'm normally getting home at around 5 or 6am. Normally as soon as I get home from work, I do some housework to keep the place clean and make my dinner, then go to bed. This does make some noise (which I do try to keep to a minimum) and I know 5 or 6 is very early for a lot of people. This never bothered John or my other 2 roommates as they are either heavy sleepers or have to get up at this time anyway to go to work in the morning.\n\nRecently John has been complaining and said that I am waking up Rose when I get home from work. He says she's a very light sleeper and that I'm disturbing her. I suggested ear plugs but he said I should be the one to change my habits since I'm the source of the noise. He said I could at least spend less time cooking my dinner. I think this is unreasonable and it's not like I'm blasting music for no reason, I'm just doing basic things.\n\nI asked if it really was such a big deal, since it's not like Rose has a job or anything to go to and she can just sleep in later. This made John blow up at me and he told me that I'm crossing the line and commenting on things that aren't my business.

I'm disturbing her sleep by my routine and I don't want to change it because I think she can suck it up as she has no responsibilities or job.\n\n(2) I'm being judgemental towards her and possibly not very understanding? I could've kept my comment to myself and just said I'm not changing my routine and been nicer about it.
