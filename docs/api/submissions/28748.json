Also, english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes.\n\nI (32f) was with my ex-boyfriend (43m) for a little over 2 years. I broke up with him a month ago because he took our relationship for granted. He thought because I loved him and I did love him, that I would never leave him even if he didn\u2019t make any effort to show me that he cared and loved me. I was the one who\u2019s always trying to see him and I was the only one that would share everything with him even if it was a stupid thought or idea because I loved that and I loved having his opinion but he wouldn\u2019t do that. He was so private and to the degree that asked him if was married. I know he\u2019s not but it got me thinking. Another issue i had with him, is me wanting him to meet my parents. It\u2019s something important for me and i thought that after 2 years it shouldn\u2019t be something not normal. He would always come up with an excuse to not do that. He even said that my parents wants to me him in order TO GET RID OF HIM and set me up with someone else. I told it was my wish to introduce them and not my parents request\u2019s and that\u2019s not true my parents would never set me up with anyone they let me pick who I wanna be with. It was after this that i thought maybe we wanted different things in life and that we should go our separate ways.\n\nAnyway, coming to the reason why I\u2019m posting here, my birthday was a couple days ago, a mutual friend of ours told me she wants to take me out for dinner for this occasion. I accepted because we are great friends, we work together and we do hang out all the time. She jokingly said that she will invite him too. I asked her please not to do this and that if he\u2019s coming I\u2019m not going to go. She assured me that she\u2019s just kidding and that she wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. I then explicitly said to her if he came I would leave and she told me not to worry. Well we walked into the restaurant and guess who\u2019s sitting at our table? If you guessed my ex than you are right. I immediately left and went home. She tried to stop me but I left anyway. She then got mad at me because I made her look bad for not staying. She said that my ex drove 45 minutes one way to be with me on my birthday and that i should\u2019ve suck it up for the duration of the dinner. And now she\u2019s not talking to me.\n\nI asked some other friends for their opinions. Some were with me but others told me that maybe I could\u2019ve stayed because he made an effort to show up and maybe he would start to change now. Yea he showed up but it wasn\u2019t his idea in the first place it was my friend who asked him to come.
