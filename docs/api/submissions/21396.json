But that was ten years ago or more.", "I always wear those little ped socks in my flats or heels so that my shoes and feet don't stink.", "Gestures to the greater world, yes they do just go around being dicks, humans suck.", "Np!  I wear Dr Scholls.  Its an inch wedge heel. I dont see my current one on their website, but there are some cute sandals!!", "I have some Dr Scholl's wedges that are sooo comfortable, even for someone who rarely wears heels. I recommend them!", "I am a 36 year old woman, and I often sit on one of my feet.  It doesn't matter if I am in a car, in a restaurant, at the movies, whatever. Part of it is being short. My feet just don't touch the ground when sitting, at least not comfortably. \n\nI get not liking feet, but this whole thing really is no big deal. I can only assume that I am just too darned laid back when it comes to feet, and evidently immature in how I sit. Lol", "If I could give you an award, I would. You made me lol for real, and I always appreciate a good laugh.", "the way i fucking snorted reading this in my head. thank you internet stranger", "I'm curious too. I sit crosslegged all the time and often barefoot and would never do this.", "Or they gather with other like minded individuals, feed into each other\u2019s failings, and become bigots", "From....sitting cross legged? I get why putting your feet on the dashboard is unsafe, but just sitting with your legs crossed? How would that lead to injuries that sitting with your feet on the floor doesn't?", "It depends on the person. My niece and brother, you can smell those feet in another room. They are gross. My sil, my daughter, and I have feet that don't sweat as much if at all, and don't normally smell.", "I have \u201cemergency flats\u201d that stay in my car to wear when I\u2019ve overestimated my ability wear heels. Once I get home the flats go back in the trunk and I walk barefoot into the house. Beat idea my husband ever had.", "Oh yes, it's true. There are people who do not smell when their feet smell, I'm one of them. I know my feet stink extremely bad (people told me) when I have worn shoes all day, but I don't really smell it. Whenever I have the chance, I will wash my feet (after coming home, at a friends place...) so nobody will die of that smell. I also use a special foot deodorant. It helps, but my feet still smell", "Adults sit however they want. Cross cross isn\u2019t child like, but these made up expectations are.", "So is your ass on the seat.", "It also very much depends on the material of the socks/shoes you are wearing. Scoks made of some kinf of polyacryl stiiiiiink.", "We also live in a society where you can walk if you don\u2019t like something going on in a car beside you.", "The comparisons y\u2019all are trying to make are moot af. Someone sitting their bare ass on a seat and someone with their shoes off are legit two different things. Y\u2019all trying too hard at this point. I\u2019m not changing what I said. He has no right to tell her how to sit in a car. Point blank period.", "Let's hear him out", "They're on a family outing, assuming thats why the family is all together. Not work.", "You're welcome. \n\nIt's danger, not dander. My poodles are hypoallergenic sock predators.", "So, feet in socks on a seat is gross while a butt in pants on the seats is not gross? You don't know where that butt has been or how clean or sweaty it is.", "What happens?", "Compound fractures, femurs completed destroyed. High risk of femoral arteries being severed. If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll live and never walk the same way again, if you walk again at all. Same with people that ride with one foot out the window. I\u2019ve seen a severed right leg up to the hip. They obviously didn\u2019t live. Absolutely gruesome way to go and the worst part it\u2019s not a quick death.", "Plus people are often nose blind to their own smell", "OP supposes their toeses are Roses,\n\n  \nBut OP supposes Erroneously,\n\n  \nOP they knowses their toeses aren't roses,\n\n  \nAs OP supposes their toeses to be!", "I am shocked I had to scroll to far to see sense in this thread. How is this any different to having your feet up at home? They're feet. She's not drawing her bare flange across the interior for heaven's sake.", "I've seen the x-ray of the pelvis of a person who had been riding with feet up on the dash. Never did that again.", "That seems sort of unprofessional?", "You lie on your bed 6-8 hours each day. If you sit in your car for that long that might make sense. But not for the duration of a regular drive. Those feet would have to be extremely disgusting to make up the difference.", "I think hands actually are usually dirtier because of all the things we touch vs feet only touching our shoes. Door knobs/handles are basically hives of bacteria waiting for people to touch them. Pens, phones, and money specially are just filled with bacteria you won't find on people's feet.", "Yup, have an almost BIL who is like this too. Always dropping weird little remarks hoping someone takes the bait (which once was me, when he said his car goes faster than his wife\u2019s. He is literally ~40). I digress, NTA", "If you want to start WW3 just ask about washing chicken or wearing \"outside clothes\" into a bedroom. People freak the fuck out about it.", "I was 5. I didn't understand what was going on, but I hated taking naps, and I rolled over crazy in my \"sleep\" with flying knees. My mom's bf's friend's gf was watching all us kids that day, and the came home for \"lunch\" Luckily he \"oofed\" when I hit him, and his gf thought he ran into the bed, and made him come out so he wouldn't wake me up. I was the only girl, so my nap time was in a different room than the boys. Thank goodness my mom didn't date that guy for long, because I had quite a few close calls with his friend. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd2e"]}
