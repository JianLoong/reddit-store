She's usually very calm and happy when we're there (she kneads more often there than at home)... except when my sister and her kid are also there\u2014very often.\n\nThe kid is spoiled, usually gets what he wants and when he doesn't, he cries and my parents come to his rescue (much to my sister's frustration). For context, they've always been the helicopter parent type of people, even when I was growing up, and my siblings and I see it extending to my sister's kid now, much to my sister's frustration.\n\nBeing a 5-year-old kid, he doesn't understand gentle play and likes to scare my cat. He would drop his toys on her, or bump his cars on her. He enjoys how she jumps and runs away when scared. I think it's also the cute aggression and him not knowing how to deal with it since he's a kid, which I understand.\n\nIt doesn't help that my cat doesn't really fight back, just runs away so the kid thinks she's playing with him. Bad for her, good for him because he's never been scratched or bitten by her.\n\nHis mom and I have tried talking to him, demonstrating gentle play, but it's not working. He's used to getting what he wants because his grandparents spoil him. He gets excited at the sight of my cat, and I get that he just sees her as a playmate.\n\nMy parents don't really care for pets as much, they have this whole idea of \"it's just a pet, it's replaceable\". What they don't understand is that this cat literally helped me out of my depression, gave me a reason to keep going, and that if anything bad happened to her, I might do something irreversible. \n\nNow, every time I gently tell the kid not to do certain things, I get judgy looks from my parents, and they take the kid's side, comforting him and cooing him even when he does something not so good. So I usually just stay quiet and his mom gets the hint and handles her kid.\n\nToday, he put a rubber band around my cat's face and I saw her struggle, and I panicked. Told him to take it off in a loud (panicked and worried) voice. He started crying, and my mom took his side.\n\nI decided against staying the night and went home. I plan to never bring her there again, at least until the kid is old enough to understand how to handle pets.\n\nI've been told I'm overprotective of my cat (like dad, like daughter).

HE KNOWS GENTLE PLAY, and if he doesn't it's because his parents didn't teach him. My 4yo and my 18mo can both play with our cats and dogs with no problem because they have been taught what happens if they don't. A scratch would probably do this boy some good.", "YTA for bringing your cat into that situation. Also kneading more doesn't mean happy all the time. It can be a sign of stress. Your sister needs to teach her kid gentle. Why hasn't she done that? He's 5 he is not a toddler. By 5 children can and should know better.", "Unpopular I\u2019m sure but: ESH.\n\nYour cat is important to you and you don\u2019t want the child to hurt it. That\u2019s not overprotective, just basic animal care. \n\nYour parents suck for taking the kid\u2019s side when he shows behavior that obviously needs coaching. \n\nYou though, why do you keep taking your cat when the kid\u2019s gonna be there? Stop. Leave it home for everyone\u2019s sake.", "YTA This happens each time your sister and her child is there yet you continue to take your cat out of the safety and protection of its home to face a five year old.  And, how is the five year olds behavior on your parents?  Does he live with them? Are they raising him? Does your sister take him over there and drop off all the time? Sounds like your sister doesn\u2019t consistently reinforce good behavior.  Since no one is teaching the five year old how to act, do your cat a favor, protect her and let her stay at home in peace.", "NTA. The actual TL;DR of this situation is you deciding to not bring a living creature to a place to be tortured at. \n\nKeep the cat safe. Just leave them at home.", "NTA. First off, your nephew isn\u2019t a toddler. He should know better, and doesn\u2019t. If I were you, I\u2019d not be taking my cat on those visits until your sister and her partner establish and enforce some sensible discipline in their child\u2019s life (which means getting your parents under control too).", "NTA. You\u2019re never an a-hole for protecting an animal from bad treatment, a child from being hurt by an animal\u2019s claws and teeth, and for teaching children that we treat animals, who have instincts and feelings, with respect. It\u2019s as much about child safety as it is animal welfare.", "NTA Putting a rubber band around the cats face isn\u2019t just rough play. It is your job to keep your pets safe. I hope this kid\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t get an animal PTS someday. Very sad indeed.", "\"if anything bad happened to her, I might do something irreversible\"\n\nNTA but because she's so important, she shouldn't have repeatedly been exposed to potential harm in the first place. I'm glad you've finally decided to stop bringing your cat to visit. If this continued, I can see that poor animal begin to associate travel to something fearful and that is completely unfair to her.", "NTA. Your cat is a living creature and as its owner it\u2019s your job to keep it alive and healthy, which you\u2019re doing. A 5 year old is not a toddler, and it is absolutely not unreasonable to enforce him playing gently. Is he allowed to be rough with people too? The rubber band could have really hurt the cat, and he needs be stopped from injuring it. \u201cCats are replaceable\u201d is a dangerous lesson to teach that kid.", "NTA - pardon my French but fuck that kid and fuck the poor parenting from your family. A pet isn't \"replaceable,\" the hell? \n\nKeep these types of people FAR AWAY from your pet before something goes haywire. The rubber band on the face is HORRIFYING and I would be beside myself if it were any of my pets.", "NTA but I think not bringing the cat near the child until he can behave and treat her nicely is the best you can do for the cat. \n\nHowever, 5 is more than old enough to understand simple boundaries such as \"don't do that to the cat\" or \"leave the cat alone\". I'm inclined to think your nephew's behavior is just the result of the terrible parenting his grandparents are doing with him, which is not their place to do, to begin with. \n\nYour sister needs to establish stronger boundaries regarding her own son.", "NTA. Your family is super toxic, allowing a kid to harm a pet and having an attitude of \u201cthis living creature is replaceable\u201d.", "NTA\n\nNot in the slightest bit. Your nephew is going to grow into a monster if his tantrums aren't curbed. Your sister is his parent and she needs to put a stop to your parents too. Total recipe for disaster. \n\nHowever, you need to stop putting your cat in that unfortunate situation. It has to be so stressful for it. Considering how your parents behave, I wouldn't take anything they have to say to heart. You are responsible for your cat's well-being and safety, which is what you did.", "NTA\n\nAnd I think you should stop bringing your kitty to your parents when you go to visit. \n\nAnd idk about your nephew, my son just turned 4 and he's gentle with all animals. Maybe it depend on the child and exposure, but he has enough understanding to give gentle pets when greeting an animal.", "YTA.

Let the kid abuse the animal and suffocate her?", "NTA for protecting your cat, but I really question why you insist on bringing her, when you know the potential conflict it creates PLUS your parents don't seem to care for having your cat at their place", "Personally, I think you were being unreasonable the minute you decided to bring your pet to someone else's home. Emotional support animals are not service animals. Service animals go with you into establishments where pets are precluded because they provide a necessary service. And they receive special training for this.\n\nEmotional support animals receive no special training and are not service animals. Although many people at least pretend not to see the distinction and bring their emotional support animals everywhere, emotional support animals stay home.\n\nBut in any case, I don't think you're setting unreasonable boundaries. A five-year-old is not a toddler. And they are old enough to understand how to handle animals. Your parents are enablers, and you need to stand up to them. You don't live with them. Unless you're dead-set on getting an inheritance from them, you don't have to capitulate to their rules or wither under their disapproving looks. Grow a spine. And that goes double for your sister. It's her child, not their grandparents' child. She needs to advise her parents that her child will abide by her rules, not theirs, and if they can't grasp this, then she needs to reduce or eliminate all contact your parents have with her child.\n\nBut you're NTA for being protective of your cat. You are TA for bringing her to someone else's home in the first place.", "YTA because the best way to protect you cat is to leave it at home & stop putting it in an unsafe environment around your nephew.", "NTA.

The cat is just the symptom.", "Absolutely 100% NTA\n\nYou and that cat have a strong bond where you pay back the affection and love they give you by protecting them from harm from others. It's a simple and effective arrangement \n\nIn my opinion 5 years old is definitely old enough to know better than putting a rubber band on the cat's face (wtf with that?) and the kids parents should be doing a much better job. My partner's nephew is three and a half and he has always been very well behaved around my two fur-babies, because his daddy (my BIL) has taught him how to pet and respect animals properly\n\nI think if that had been me in your situation the kid would have been punted across the room", "NTA. Were you supposed to let the toddler abuse your cat? I'd be the same way.", "ESH - i can understand your point of view! A pet can never be replaced like an object and children should learn about other living creatures and their feelings but what i dont understand is - why do you have to bring your cat in the first place? Leaving your cat at home for a night is more than acceptable imho. Poor cat i would say", "**ESH.** \n\nI started to say N-T-A but then read some of your comments. Your family are obvious AHs, but you're really not a good cat owner if you're repeatedly putting your pet in harm's way to soothe your own anxiety. \n\nYou're N-T-A for protecting your cat from a child who long since should have been taught gentleness with animals.\n\nBUT . . . you're an AH for continuing to bring your cat over to visit that household when you know that she has been REPEATEDLY harmed there by your nephew.\n\nYou talk about separation anxiety and worrying about her, but that's a terrible excuse. She's clearly much safer left at your place, and separation anxiety does not get fixed with codependence, but with therapy. It's your job to protect her, and it's unnecessary to bring her into that household. Please leave her at home, where you know there is no chance of her encountering the child who will just keep continuing to hurt her. An emotional support animal is supposed to be a comfort, yes, but she is still a living creature who is dependent on you. It's a terrible thing to treat her like a stuffy that you can drag all over the place, even to places where she is being harmed, just to make yourself feel better.", "NTA.\n\n5 years old is plenty old enough to understand the words \"stay away from the cat\" and \"don't touch the cat\". There was absolutely nothing wrong with you yelling at him - *someone* has to be the adult in the room, and since neither your parents nor your sister are up to the task, you stepped up.\n\nYou are making the right call to leave your cat at home, since your mother has no problem with your cat being abused.", "NTA. It sounds like the problem is your parents. Your sister understands and I would suggest that as he gets older it might be a good idea to spend time with them without your parents around. That way he has the opportunity to learn and when he inevitably messes up, because kid, sis can redirect him without your parents rug sweeping bad behavior.\n\n I contemplated getting rid of our dog about a month after we got her because my autistic 4 yr old had a hard time grasping gentle play. I'm a stern parent and it was still hard for me to keep him from hurting her and vice versa. But she helps my husband manage his ADHD and depression so I didn't want to take that away from him. It took about 6 months of constant coaching but now he'll run up to her screaming, abruptly stop and gently pet her and tell her she's a good girl or find her toys and throw them so she'll run around crazy chasing them. Longest 6onths of my life so far but worth it.", "NTA\nKeep the cat safe", "NTA\nThe kid is 5. He should understand that he has to be gentle with animals. You/his parents should be strict/angry with him when he is being rough after you already explained it. Your sister is letting the grandparents ruin the child by not correcting Thier behavior.", "NTA\n\nYes lucky for your nephew he hasn't been scratched or bitten yet. It's a perfectly reasonable outcome that he will eventually be though. \n\nYour parents are absolutely AHs and I feel for both you and your sister for having to deal with them. It might be worth separating your cat when you are in the same space as your nephew, at least until he is old enough to not harass her. I would have personally freaked out a lot more than you did if someone put a rubber band around my pet's neck. \n\nHonestly, even when I was 5 I understood that you don't mess with animals. I think 5 is old enough to start learning how to gentle play with pets.", "NTA definitely not unreasonable, your parents sound insufferable, apathetic, and selfish. You\u2019re right that the toddler doesn\u2019t know any better and it sounds like your parents are reinforcing that bad behavior which will just make it worse.

Children should always be monitored around pets to make sure nothing happens to either the pet or the child. \n\nIt seems like your sister gets that the behavior from her child is not appropriate but your parents just undermine the both of you.

Many 5 yr olds can understand being gentle with animals but when they aren't then it's on adults to prevent a bad interaction that could hurt one or both child and animal. Your cat could eventually react and scratch and then they'd blame you and the cat. I would either confine the cat to one room when child is there or hire a cat sitter for overnights and leave cat safely at home until the child has matured more. You did the right thing and everyone should ideally reinforce gentle and kind care of small animals not only for the pet, but to raise the child with an understanding of empathy, caring and protecting vulnerable creatures. It's weird your parents don't get it, especially when he's put a rubber band around it's face. That's not a road you want him to go down.

Everyone must be on the same side when it comes to stuff like this otherwise the kid knows that they can manipulate the situation and the people who let them get away with everything will come to the rescue.

Last year, before the baby was born, he bit my friend because ONE OF THE OTHER CATS startled him.  \n\nMy point is that her BABY, who is so little that he cannot even crawl or say any words yet, is learning \"gentle pets\" and \"kind, kind\" out of NECESSITY (the cats mostly just avoid him when he's grabby, but the big one actually adores him and we're pretty sure he thinks that's his human kitten). And it doesn't even require a live cat to practice. They use a realistic-looking stuffed one, so he understands what they're doing, and they gently correct him and move his hands away when he is too grabby or harsh, and then move his hands gently over the cat to show him the right way. \n\nA 5-year-old is in kindergarten. They can talk and comprehend things. Yes, they are still very young, but that child is very much old ENOUGH to understand \"you need to be gentle with the cat or it will hurt him\".

You don't get to put her in harm's way because you're \"sad being away from her\". You don't need an ESA, you need a therapist.
