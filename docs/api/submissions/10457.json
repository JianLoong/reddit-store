She's usually very calm and happy when we're there (she kneads more often there than at home)... except when my sister and her kid are also there\u2014very often.\n\nThe kid is spoiled, usually gets what he wants and when he doesn't, he cries and my parents come to his rescue (much to my sister's frustration). For context, they've always been the helicopter parent type of people, even when I was growing up, and my siblings and I see it extending to my sister's kid now, much to my sister's frustration.\n\nBeing a 5-year-old kid, he doesn't understand gentle play and likes to scare my cat. He would drop his toys on her, or bump his cars on her. He enjoys how she jumps and runs away when scared. I think it's also the cute aggression and him not knowing how to deal with it since he's a kid, which I understand.\n\nIt doesn't help that my cat doesn't really fight back, just runs away so the kid thinks she's playing with him. Bad for her, good for him because he's never been scratched or bitten by her.\n\nHis mom and I have tried talking to him, demonstrating gentle play, but it's not working. He's used to getting what he wants because his grandparents spoil him. He gets excited at the sight of my cat, and I get that he just sees her as a playmate.\n\nMy parents don't really care for pets as much, they have this whole idea of \"it's just a pet, it's replaceable\". What they don't understand is that this cat literally helped me out of my depression, gave me a reason to keep going, and that if anything bad happened to her, I might do something irreversible. \n\nNow, every time I gently tell the kid not to do certain things, I get judgy looks from my parents, and they take the kid's side, comforting him and cooing him even when he does something not so good. So I usually just stay quiet and his mom gets the hint and handles her kid.\n\nToday, he put a rubber band around my cat's face and I saw her struggle, and I panicked. Told him to take it off in a loud (panicked and worried) voice. He started crying, and my mom took his side.\n\nI decided against staying the night and went home. I plan to never bring her there again, at least until the kid is old enough to understand how to handle pets.\n\nI've been told I'm overprotective of my cat (like dad, like daughter).

My 4yo and my 18mo can both play with our cats and dogs with no problem because they have been taught what happens if they don't. A scratch would probably do this boy some good.", "YTA for bringing your cat into that situation. Also kneading more doesn't mean happy all the time. It can be a sign of stress. Your sister needs to teach her kid gentle. Why hasn't she done that? He's 5 he is not a toddler. By 5 children can and should know better.", "Unpopular I\u2019m sure but: ESH.\n\nYour cat is important to you and you don\u2019t want the child to hurt it. That\u2019s not overprotective, just basic animal care. \n\nYour parents suck for taking the kid\u2019s side when he shows behavior that obviously needs coaching. \n\nYou though, why do you keep taking your cat when the kid\u2019s gonna be there? Stop. Leave it home for everyone\u2019s sake.", "YTA This happens each time your sister and her child is there yet you continue to take your cat out of the safety and protection of its home to face a five year old.  And, how is the five year olds behavior on your parents?  Does he live with them? Are they raising him? Does your sister take him over there and drop off all the time? Sounds like your sister doesn\u2019t consistently reinforce good behavior.  Since no one is teaching the five year old how to act, do your cat a favor, protect her and let her stay at home in peace.", "NTA. The actual TL;DR of this situation is you deciding to not bring a living creature to a place to be tortured at. \n\nKeep the cat safe. Just leave them at home.", "NTA. First off, your nephew isn\u2019t a toddler. He should know better, and doesn\u2019t. If I were you, I\u2019d not be taking my cat on those visits until your sister and her partner establish and enforce some sensible discipline in their child\u2019s life (which means getting your parents under control too).", "NTA. You\u2019re never an a-hole for protecting an animal from bad treatment, a child from being hurt by an animal\u2019s claws and teeth, and for teaching children that we treat animals, who have instincts and feelings, with respect. It\u2019s as much about child safety as it is animal welfare.", "NTA Putting a rubber band around the cats face isn\u2019t just rough play. It is your job to keep your pets safe.

Very sad indeed.", "\"if anything bad happened to her, I might do something irreversible\"\n\nNTA but because she's so important, she shouldn't have repeatedly been exposed to potential harm in the first place. I'm glad you've finally decided to stop bringing your cat to visit. If this continued, I can see that poor animal begin to associate travel to something fearful and that is completely unfair to her.", "NTA. Your cat is a living creature and as its owner it\u2019s your job to keep it alive and healthy, which you\u2019re doing. A 5 year old is not a toddler, and it is absolutely not unreasonable to enforce him playing gently. Is he allowed to be rough with people too? The rubber band could have really hurt the cat, and he needs be stopped from injuring it. \u201cCats are replaceable\u201d is a dangerous lesson to teach that kid.", "NTA - pardon my French but fuck that kid and fuck the poor parenting from your family.

The rubber band on the face is HORRIFYING and I would be beside myself if it were any of my pets.", "NTA but I think not bringing the cat near the child until he can behave and treat her nicely is the best you can do for the cat. \n\nHowever, 5 is more than old enough to understand simple boundaries such as \"don't do that to the cat\" or \"leave the cat alone\". I'm inclined to think your nephew's behavior is just the result of the terrible parenting his grandparents are doing with him, which is not their place to do, to begin with. \n\nYour sister needs to establish stronger boundaries regarding her own son.", "NTA. Your family is super toxic, allowing a kid to harm a pet and having an attitude of \u201cthis living creature is replaceable\u201d.", "NTA\n\nNot in the slightest bit. Your nephew is going to grow into a monster if his tantrums aren't curbed. Your sister is his parent and she needs to put a stop to your parents too. Total recipe for disaster. \n\nHowever, you need to stop putting your cat in that unfortunate situation. It has to be so stressful for it. Considering how your parents behave, I wouldn't take anything they have to say to heart. You are responsible for your cat's well-being and safety, which is what you did.", "NTA\n\nAnd I think you should stop bringing your kitty to your parents when you go to visit. \n\nAnd idk about your nephew, my son just turned 4 and he's gentle with all animals.

Let the kid abuse the animal and suffocate her?", "NTA for protecting your cat, but I really question why you insist on bringing her, when you know the potential conflict it creates PLUS your parents don't seem to care for having your cat at their place", "Personally, I think you were being unreasonable the minute you decided to bring your pet to someone else's home. Emotional support animals are not service animals. Service animals go with you into establishments where pets are precluded because they provide a necessary service. And they receive special training for this.\n\nEmotional support animals receive no special training and are not service animals. Although many people at least pretend not to see the distinction and bring their emotional support animals everywhere, emotional support animals stay home.\n\nBut in any case, I don't think you're setting unreasonable boundaries. A five-year-old is not a toddler. And they are old enough to understand how to handle animals. Your parents are enablers, and you need to stand up to them. You don't live with them. Unless you're dead-set on getting an inheritance from them, you don't have to capitulate to their rules or wither under their disapproving looks. Grow a spine. And that goes double for your sister. It's her child, not their grandparents' child. She needs to advise her parents that her child will abide by her rules, not theirs, and if they can't grasp this, then she needs to reduce or eliminate all contact your parents have with her child.\n\nBut you're NTA for being protective of your cat. You are TA for bringing her to someone else's home in the first place.", "YTA because the best way to protect you cat is to leave it at home & stop putting it in an unsafe environment around your nephew.", "NTA.

The cat is just the symptom.", "Absolutely 100% NTA\n\nYou and that cat have a strong bond where you pay back the affection and love they give you by protecting them from harm from others. It's a simple and effective arrangement \n\nIn my opinion 5 years old is definitely old enough to know better than putting a rubber band on the cat's face (wtf with that?) and the kids parents should be doing a much better job. My partner's nephew is three and a half and he has always been very well behaved around my two fur-babies, because his daddy (my BIL) has taught him how to pet and respect animals properly\n\nI think if that had been me in your situation the kid would have been punted across the room", "NTA. Were you supposed to let the toddler abuse your cat? I'd be the same way.", "ESH - i can understand your point of view! A pet can never be replaced like an object and children should learn about other living creatures and their feelings but what i dont understand is - why do you have to bring your cat in the first place? Leaving your cat at home for a night is more than acceptable imho. Poor cat i would say", "**ESH.** \n\nI started to say N-T-A but then read some of your comments. Your family are obvious AHs, but you're really not a good cat owner if you're repeatedly putting your pet in harm's way to soothe your own anxiety. \n\nYou're N-T-A for protecting your cat from a child who long since should have been taught gentleness with animals.\n\nBUT . . . you're an AH for continuing to bring your cat over to visit that household when you know that she has been REPEATEDLY harmed there by your nephew.\n\nYou talk about separation anxiety and worrying about her, but that's a terrible excuse. She's clearly much safer left at your place, and separation anxiety does not get fixed with codependence, but with therapy. It's your job to protect her, and it's unnecessary to bring her into that household. Please leave her at home, where you know there is no chance of her encountering the child who will just keep continuing to hurt her. An emotional support animal is supposed to be a comfort, yes, but she is still a living creature who is dependent on you. It's a terrible thing to treat her like a stuffy that you can drag all over the place, even to places where she is being harmed, just to make yourself feel better.", "NTA.\n\n5 years old is plenty old enough to understand the words \"stay away from the cat\" and \"don't touch the cat\". There was absolutely nothing wrong with you yelling at him - *someone* has to be the adult in the room, and since neither your parents nor your sister are up to the task, you stepped up.\n\nYou are making the right call to leave your cat at home, since your mother has no problem with your cat being abused.", "NTA. It sounds like the problem is your parents. Your sister understands and I would suggest that as he gets older it might be a good idea to spend time with them without your parents around. That way he has the opportunity to learn and when he inevitably messes up, because kid, sis can redirect him without your parents rug sweeping bad behavior.\n\n I contemplated getting rid of our dog about a month after we got her because my autistic 4 yr old had a hard time grasping gentle play. I'm a stern parent and it was still hard for me to keep him from hurting her and vice versa. But she helps my husband manage his ADHD and depression so I didn't want to take that away from him. It took about 6 months of constant coaching but now he'll run up to her screaming, abruptly stop and gently pet her and tell her she's a good girl or find her toys and throw them so she'll run around crazy chasing them. Longest 6onths of my life so far but worth it.", "NTA\nKeep the cat safe", "NTA\nThe kid is 5. He should understand that he has to be gentle with animals. You/his parents should be strict/angry with him when he is being rough after you already explained it. Your sister is letting the grandparents ruin the child by not correcting Thier behavior.", "NTA\n\nYes lucky for your nephew he hasn't been scratched or bitten yet. It's a perfectly reasonable outcome that he will eventually be though. \n\nYour parents are absolutely AHs and I feel for both you and your sister for having to deal with them. It might be worth separating your cat when you are in the same space as your nephew, at least until he is old enough to not harass her. I would have personally freaked out a lot more than you did if someone put a rubber band around my pet's neck. \n\nHonestly, even when I was 5 I understood that you don't mess with animals. I think 5 is old enough to start learning how to gentle play with pets.", "NTA definitely not unreasonable, your parents sound insufferable, apathetic, and selfish. You\u2019re right that the toddler doesn\u2019t know any better and it sounds like your parents are reinforcing that bad behavior which will just make it worse.

Many 5 yr olds can understand being gentle with animals but when they aren't then it's on adults to prevent a bad interaction that could hurt one or both child and animal. Your cat could eventually react and scratch and then they'd blame you and the cat. I would either confine the cat to one room when child is there or hire a cat sitter for overnights and leave cat safely at home until the child has matured more. You did the right thing and everyone should ideally reinforce gentle and kind care of small animals not only for the pet, but to raise the child with an understanding of empathy, caring and protecting vulnerable creatures.

Last year, before the baby was born, he bit my friend because ONE OF THE OTHER CATS startled him.  \n\nMy point is that her BABY, who is so little that he cannot even crawl or say any words yet, is learning \"gentle pets\" and \"kind, kind\" out of NECESSITY (the cats mostly just avoid him when he's grabby, but the big one actually adores him and we're pretty sure he thinks that's his human kitten). And it doesn't even require a live cat to practice. They use a realistic-looking stuffed one, so he understands what they're doing, and they gently correct him and move his hands away when he is too grabby or harsh, and then move his hands gently over the cat to show him the right way. \n\nA 5-year-old is in kindergarten.

You don't get to put her in harm's way because you're \"sad being away from her\". You don't need an ESA, you need a therapist.

NTA but also Y T A to your cat. This should have stopped long ago. My 2 y/o niece can understand gentle touch, there's no way a typical 5 y/o can't. He just sounds spoiled. Your sister also needs to step in.", "NTA. I agree no more taking the cat with you. One idea\u2014maybe suggest taking the kiddo to an animal shelter to volunteer so he can learn healthy behavioral interactions with animals? I saw that help some kids on a few episodes of \u201cMy Cat From Hell\u201d.", "NTA I don\u2019t even need to read it. Thank you for keeping your cat safe", "NTA but you will be if you keep taking your cat over there.  I LOVEEE cats but I don't think it is good to put them in harm's way.    You know it is an issue.   It is up to you to protect her.", "Edit : im changing my ruling.. your sister shouldn't need a hint to parent her kid. Your parents suck for undermining your sister.. you suck for not caring enough about your cat to keep them the hell away from your godawful nephew.", "Nta but you will be if you keep putting your cat in these situations. You can\u2019t control these people but you can control where you take your pet.", "NTA but holy crap- someone needs to rein in your parents before they turn that kid into a sociopathic monster.", "No.", "So I have a cat. My niblings know that they can offer their hand for him to sniff and they can try to gently pet him, but if he doesn't want them to, they have to leave him alone. \n\nOnce--only once--did one of my nieces try to grab him when he wasn't interested. She was around five or six and tried to pick him up by one leg when I wasn't in the room. The sound he made brought forth such anger from me, I shouted for her to let him go before I was even in the room to know what had happened. I had to take a minute to calm myself down and make sure he was okay before I could even have a rational discussion with a child about how she'd hurt him. (I did apologize for scaring her, as I don't ever yell, and she'd never even heard me raise my voice before.) \n\nGrandparents suck for not helping you, but that cat is your responsibility. Regardless of whether they can defend themselves or not, cats are smaller and weaker than any human with hands that can grab and hold and squeeze. It is on you, as the pet owner, to protect them, however that means. \n\nESH", "NTA, ping protective of the cat protects the cat AND the kid. If the kid did something to make the cat attack him, they would blame the cat.", "Nta 100% \n\nI'm not a fan of kids, but if one ever messed with my cats I would feel the same way too. Kids don't understand how to be gentle with animals unless taught, and especially with cats if their boundaries are crossed they'll easily scratch. Definitely is best to not have your cat around them anymore, not everyone loves cats or respects them unfortunately", "A five year old is not a toddler. A five year old is an elementary school student. A five year old can go to kindergarten and learn letters. I'm teaching 6-year-olds and they show more respect to bugs than your nephew does to a cat. And yeah, he's a kid. But he's not a toddler.", "NTA, but I hope you\u2019re in therapy for your mental health. You implied that if something bad happened to your cat, you\u2019d hurt yourself (\u201cdo something irreversible\u201d). That\u2019s not healthy. Your cat could be in any sort of accident or simply pass from old age eventually and your personal health and safety should not be that drastically dependent on your cat. (I\u2019m both a pet mom and someone with severe depression)", "NTA. Five years is certainly old enough to know how to behave around pets. Your sister is doing him a disservice by not correcting your parents when they undermine her.", "Tbh you would be doing your fur baby right by not taking him there anymore cause it would be a matter of time til the cat fought back.", "He's plenty old enough to understand and demonstrate gentle play. That can start very, very early in toddler age.\n\nYour cat may be kneading more to comfort herself due to stress. Best option is to leave her home, especially as your parents don't much care for pets. NTA", "Just don't take the cat into that situation. damn.", "NTA.  That being said, you should never have taken your cat back to that toxic environment after the first abuse.  Five years old IS old enough to learn to be gentle.  Don't take your cat there again.", "Absolutely NTA, and your parents, while I'm sure they mean well, are doing a huge disservice to everyone by spoiling the kid like that and not trying harder to teach him how to be around pets. But then again, if they think a pet is replaceable, that kind of tells me they lack some basic understanding of pets and pet ownership.\n\nYour plan is sound, stop bringing the cat over there, especially when you know the kid is there too, clearly you can't get through to him or them so you need to protect your cat at all costs.", "Nta. And  the kids gp are ah", "NTA, 5 is well old enough to know not to treat animals like that. If the kid was 2 or 3 I would think they just don't understand, but by 5 they should have enough social skills to know how to be gentle.", "NTA.  Five years-old is plenty old enough to understand not to terrorize pets and be gentle.  A three year-old can learn that.  YWBTA if you keep exposing your cat to this ill mannered child. Why is no one correcting him harshly?  He needs to be scared the way he scares the cat.  Quit being gentle with a rough abusive child.  He is going to get in a ton of trouble for bullying other students in school as he has already decided he likes to terrorize animals.", "NTA\n\nA five year old is *NOT* a toddler.  That's a school age kid.  That's plenty old enough to know how to be gentle and use soft hands.  I can guarantee that the kid doesn't do that with human playmates or he'd get bit or scolded by their parents.\n\nYour nephew sounds like he's pushing boundaries to find the limits of socially acceptable behavior (normal & age appropriate behavior), but none of the adults in his life are setting boundaries, which is terrible for the kid.", "NTA.  I am mum, all my kids has at age 5 understood how to handle animal and that you dont hurt them. This kid hasnt been taught how to play and is spoiled, one day a cat will bite him.", "NTA 5 is certainly old enough to understand gentle play", "NTA. Our 3 yo learned how to be gentle with our cats and dogs by the time she was 2. Most kids do.\n\nBut stop taking the cat places. It\u2019s not just badly behaved children that are a risk. The cat could get scared and run off. It could get chased or hurt by another cat or dog, etc.", "NTA but a 5 year old can understand gentle play. My 3 & 4 year old grandsons do when playing with my dog. They have also been taught to ask before approaching any strange dog or playing with an animal. This includes animals they know.", "NTA Protect your cat! I have a toddler myself and he doesn\u2019t understand how to play gentle with animals. He adores my sisters cat, greyhound. but he can be so rough. Finally greyhound started fighting back. Now she didn\u2019t hurt him. She will tap him on the head or arm with her little paw twice, and usually he leaves her alone after. She never uses her claws. I was cracking up the first time she did it, you would have thought she bit my son. Lmao", "NTA \nAs a mother with pets.. young ones need constant supervision around animals. I can\u2019t count the number of times the animals could have literally died because of my son if I wasn\u2019t there. Thankfully he finally learned how to treat animals but for the longest time he was actually banned from getting anywhere near them unless I had the animal in my lap and we pet it together. (2 dogs and 2 cats) he\u2019s now five and is a champ at helping to feed them, pet them, and being overall gentle with them. But it took years. It wasn\u2019t overnight.", "That cat will either be seriously injured or nearly die before they care and even then they might not.", "NTA and neither is your sister or nephew. Your parents are. Lol, if my parents called my cat replaceable, I would tell them to replace me since I'm cutting contact with them. What kind of complete lack of empathy for other alive beings is that? Kids can definitely play nice with animals if they are sat down and explained why (plus the \"if you can't play nice, you won't play with it at all\" threat to make boundaries clear) but if your parents keep enabling it and telling him there is nothing wrong with him playing rough, he won't see where is the problem", "NTA you did right by trying to teach him to be careful with animals. If he does this to a dog, it could be tragic. When my daughter was 15 months old, she yanked our cat\u2019s tail (I was in the room and she was only 15 months old and did not know better) our cat swiped her face coming very close to her eye. I grabbed my daughter super quick and fortunately she just had a scratch. I never got mad at the cat or my toddler but learned to teach my daughter how to be careful and gentle around animals. How anyone can be upset over teaching a child to do that is beyond me", "Nta", "There's a lot going on here, but ultimately YTA for taking your cat to family gatherings. It's just not a thing to do with cats. It sounds like you're folks aren't really pet people and you know there's going to be an unruly child there.  Leave the cat at home instead of imposing on everyone and trying to take it upon yourself to parent someone's kid.\n\nOn a side note, take ownership of your recovery. Cats are comforting, but they don't 'help' you do anything. You got yourself out of that depression. When your cat inevitably passes away you will be sad but that same strength will get you through it.", "YTA. Kids do this kind of thing and cats aren\u2019t supposed to be dragged around to other peoples houses.", "You\u2019re the AH for continuing to bring the cat there.\nKid is harming your cat when you bring it to your parents parents house, and they don\u2019t discourage that behaviour so he is  not learning to stop - so don\u2019t bring your cat.\n\nIf nephew can\u2019t be nice to kitty then nephew does not get to see kitty. The cats a cat, the child is a child. You are an adult with full control of who interacts with the cat and where you bring it. And it\u2019s not outside the realm of belief that your parents are not discouraging it because they don\u2019t want a cat in their house. It\u2019s not their pet.", "That was my first thought. He needs to find out firsthand that cats can be sharp!", "Say to him that you would love to bring your cat. But you can't anymore because he hurts her every time.", "And then you say I know you like the cat but you don\u2019t listen and are doing things that hurt it so I am leaving it home from now on.  Mom will get pissy, so what.", "You certainly shouldn't be bringing the cat for the toddler to abuse!  I thought you were bringing the cat because you couldn't bear to be apart.\n\nThis is the perfect opportunity for the kid to learn that if you abuse an animal, you lose access to them.", "I'll be honest, I'm very disappointed that you are still bringing the at around after this happened a few times.\n\nYour pet is not a prop / toy to entertain others. You should not even be thinking about what that child wants, you need to put your cat first.\n\nYour pet can't talk, you are their advocate.", "Good idea, and maybe a good teachable moment when he asks next on how gentle play needs to be in order to see the kitty :)", "You\u2019re not parenting the 5yo, you\u2019re protecting your cat.  \nFWIW 5 is not a toddler.", "You don\u2019t have to tell your sister how to parent her kid. You do have to protect your cat.", "Get a pet camera, that way you can check on her when you're gone. Helps me a ton.", "Get a home camera you can watch her from your phone", "OP you make a comment that you would consider self harm if something happened to your cat.\n\n\"What they don't understand is that this cat literally helped me out of my depression, gave me a reason to keep going, and that if anything bad happened to her, I might do something irreversible.\"\n\nPlease start working on contingency plans. Cats, humans, even plants die. That is the nature of life.", "I also don\u2019t like spending nights away from my cats but I do if it\u2019s necessary because they\u2019re much more comfortable at home and hate car rides lol. \n\nIf it helps you feel better, you can get a little camera to see what she\u2019s up to at home. I got some Blink cameras and aimed them at my cats favorite spots. I was worried they\u2019d be sitting by the front door waiting for me the whole time like you see in some videos\u2026 nope they slept most of the time in their normal spots. One of them did walk around meowing and looking for me for a few minutes and they ran over to the camera any time I talked to them through it.\n\nEditing to add: I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people in the older generations (including my Asian grandparents and parents) also think of animals as replaceable. But here\u2019s the thing. They see how much *I* love my cats and even if *they* don\u2019t love my cats the same way, they treat my pets with respect because they love and respect me.", "\nHe must realize that he must be gentle with animals. You/his parents should be strict/angry with him when he is behaving rough after you have already explained.", "Doesn't seem like the kid's mom actually will, since she's also in combat with the grandparents about how they treat her son.", "Until the grandparents give him a kitten of his own to abuse \ud83d\ude12", "My 8 month old learned how to gently pet my cat.  And she treated him as an unruly kitten.  So very much NTA.  Your parent's aren't doing the kid any favors.", "Great suggestion re. camera!", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting to be with your cat but I agree that you\u2019ve also been the AH for bringing her into that unsafe situation. If your parents aren\u2019t going to respect you and your cat, maybe you should rethink spending nights there instead. \n\nDo not bring your cat over and try to keep her in a separate room. Your parents sound like they would let your nephew in to see the cat as soon as he started whining about it. 5 years old is plenty old enough to learn boundaries and consequences. If he can\u2019t play nice with your cat, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed around her at all. And any time he asks about her, remind him why."]}
