They are *not* free to demand to bring someone who wasn't invited. End of.\n\nI don't think weddings should have to be designated 'child-free'; they are *all* 'invitation-only'.

Everyone of thoes people were going to be at the wedding. My husband side of the family there isn't really any contact. My son is also deaf so it would have had to be someone who could communicate with him. I am a mother above everything else and I had to make sure my children would be safe and comfortable above anyone else's feelings. So I would have 100 percent stayed home from the wedding had they not changed it. \n\nUltimately you have to decide more who you want there to celebrate your day with you and out weigh that with not having children there.

And she never offered to pay, AND she went and bought about 50 dollars worth of cheap crap from winners as a gift instead of cash as we requested) It makes my blood boil to this day just thinking about it. I caved and allowed her kids to come and they were underdressed and bored the entire time, and about an hour into the reception she came into where the bridesmaids were hanging with a baby stroller and RAN OVER the back of my dress ripping the entire back of it. I had to safety pin the dress up all night because she ruined it, and her kids looked bored and just played outside all night causing her to have to leave early.

Other guests lived closer which was why the evening reception had an unauthorised child who ended up making her group leave early due to a tantrum with how late the reception ended.

Why not an age restriction in the other direction? \n\nmy conclusion is: I see a wedding as a family celebration, maybe second to \u201eyour day\u201c. As a family, I believe you should be inclusive, not exclusive.

When you're paying per head and there's no discount for kids, eliminating them is an easy way to shave off hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars, depending on how many kids your family and friends have. Secondly, there's also a growing norm that parents \u2013 more so friends than family \u2013 get to enjoy a night away from their children. \n\nBut I'd say that the biggest reason is easily the fact that I've noticed a huge spike in completely unsupervised kids at these parents. My partner and I have been to two weddings where kids have actually gotten into the alcohol. One had to have their stomach pumped. Mutual friends have had similarly bad experiences. The biggest fear for us isn't something like \"they might cry during the ceremony,\" it's the risk of *actual serious harm.*", ">I'm not sure how child-free weddings got so popular. \n\nMy guess is that it started getting popular around the time when people stopped being considerate where their kids were concerned. Used to be that kids were expected to sit quietly with a soft book or toy throughout a solemn event and parents would take a crying or disruptive child outside or to a crying room to settle them before returning... I have noticed lately that parents just give their kids a tablet/device without ear buds and allow them to use full volume regardless of the event... they allow them to run around and be disruptive without taking them out... \n\nIf you're trying to have a calm/peaceful event, you don't want a bunch of people with the entitled attitude that their kid can do no wrong bringing said child to that event...", "Because not everyone likes kids.", ">I'm not sure how child-free weddings got so popular\n\nCause they're better than those who have kids running and screaming.", "It\u2019s probably tied into the period when parents decided letting their children roam free like wild animals and never get scolded for a single thing for their \u201cmental well-being\u201d began.", "Kids still cost \ud83d\udcb2most people don\u2019t have an unlimited budget for their wedding", "What's selfish is to expect your sibling to cater to your wants for their wedding.", "Is this it though?

As soon as you start making exceptions, even for your own children, you create complications. For couple with children who they want to be able to be at the wedding and the first part of the reception, my suggestion is to create a kids room and create a sort of nursery the way that churches do, but one for all ages. It\u2019s surprisingly easy really and not too expensive compared to a lot of what you\u2019re probably already doing. \n\nHonestly, seven year olds are going to get bored at your reception after a bit. It is going to be a long day for them already and by the time the first few dances are done they\u2019ll probably be happy to have someplace else to go where they can lay down or watch cartoons. After telling one couple this they actually created a couple of rooms for the kids at the hotel where they were planning to do everything. One was for 13 and up and the other was for 12 and under. Both rooms were mini suites with two rooms. The teens had room for video games and the groom brought his PlayStation and a room for movies or anything else in the mini suite. The twelve and under had a quiet room and a room for cartoons. Kids could lay out on the beds or the floor and some parents brought sleeping bags for their kids. There were 2 adults hired for the teens\u2019 room to make sure that they didn\u2019t get up to anything and 2 for the younger kids to sit for them. \n\nI did the ceremony and left because I wasn\u2019t really family. A few weeks after the ceremony I got to ask them how it had gone and they said it was great because kids got to feel included and then the reception turned into the elegant affair the bride and groom had really wanted. They partied all evening and when the reception finally broke up everyone went home. They said that when they came back from their honeymoon they checked their email and phone messages for the first time in over a week and were flooded with messages from family and friends telling them that they had had the best time at the wedding of any they\u2019d ever been to in their lives and that their kids said the same thing. \n\nSo, you do you, but if you\u2019re going to have kids at the reception they I really think you should do all or nothing, and not just for family but for everyone invited.", "It\u2019s absolutely your decision/your wedding.

It really wasn't that important to me. I had zero understanding of the significance, bored by the speeches/ceremony, honestly just taking up space. I stayed in the hotel at like 14 with my siblings when my parents went to a wedding and had the best time ordering pizza and a movie. My experience i know but in my circle, kids having fun babysitter time and parents having their own time is normal for certain events. \n\n2. Limited people. I have a big family and a lot of close friends that are like family. It was important to me to celebrate with them and id have to cut that by 20 people if our siblings kids were there. \n\n3. The wedding went until 11 and there wasn't space for kids to crash. If you want your kids up that late, that's fine but for many of the kids, it's too late. I'd have to have a different venue and do a different time to accommodate kids if I wanted my siblings to stay for the whole wedding. \n\n4. I was by no means needy of everyone's 100% attention but the special moments I had w my sister wouldn't have happened if she was being her awesome mom self. I cherish the times I have with her and my nieces but it's good to have one on one time too. \n\n5. The vibe is different. And that's not good or bad. I will go to a wedding with 50% kids in attendance and it is funny, sweet and such a cool celebration w family. They are fun, dance floor is hoppin, it is great. A wedding without kids is also fun but in a different way. Night on the town vibes. There are plenty of places that don't allow kids and it's just choosing that type of place over the other. Brewery vs the club. Both fine but they are different. \n\n\nI have seen some wild ceremony moments with kids but whatever. That's life. A plane could have flown over during mine.

The age cut off is typically anywhere from 13 to 18. The bride/grooms kids are often the exception (this was the case for my wedding).  I don\u2019t see the big deal. The fact that I would have had to invite and pay for every guest\u2019s children would have meant almost as many kids there as adults. It would have been romper room and added an exorbitant amount to the cost of my wedding. The fact they have to pay for a sitter is just a fact of life. They have to pay for a sitter if they want to go out for dinner with their spouse. If they can\u2019t pay for a sitter or don\u2019t want to that is totally fine, a wedding invite is not a summons and I 109% understand their choice. \n\nNone of this is a reflection on how much I love or care for my family and friends children. Not even a little bit. Kids are invited to pretty much every other party that happens. And I have never once felt slighted that my kids weren\u2019t invited to other people\u2019s weddings. They just\u2026don\u2019t want kids there. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like my kids. If my friends invited us to go out drinking at a bar without kids I wouldn\u2019t think that meant they hated my kids. \n\nAbsolutely NTA and if your family can\u2019t understand the difference between their kids and your kids they are being intentionally obtuse.", ">I might ask why and try to discuss so I understand better why this was the line they were drawing\n\nThere have been stories on here about kids who screamed and ran wild during the ceremony, ruining the video; kids who screamed and ran wild during the reception -- several stories of the cake being destroyed, clothes being ruined, other outrageous behavior. I think that's pretty easy to understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>what it meant to our relationship\n\nBut it's not about *you*. It's not about *your kids*. It's about the bride and groom wanting to have a lovely, special day and not have it ruined by out-of-control children who won't even understand the significance of the occasion and probably won't even remember the event.\n\nI know what you're going to say here: \"But my kids aren't like that.\" *All* parents say that -- and it's often not true. But even if it is true for you, if your kids are allowed, then all the other out-of-control kids have to be allowed, too. I think that's pretty easy to understand.", "I've been to a wedding where a toddler ran around screaming for the whole wedding then pulled his pants down and peed off to the side in front of all the guests.  I completely understand why people don't want other people's kids at their wedding.", "Thousands of 7 year old twins who are very close, grow up and stay very close.  Thousands of 7 year olds twins who never were very close, grow up and still aren't very close.  Thousands of 7 year old twins are are very close, grow up and drift apart from each other.  Thousands of 7 year olds who weren't very close, grow up and reconnect with each other.  \"More frequent than the opposite\" still doesn't mean anything.", "you're wasting your breath. i think that's the sister's burner account, they're replying to EVERY comment like they're so hurt lmao", "That's literally not what blackmail means. Go look up the definition of blackmail.", "People need to be hard line. Entitled People show up with their kids at events where they're not invited \"because what are you gonna do about it\"?  It's worth hiring a bouncer. Maybe if they get turned away they'll stop acting as if THEY ruled the world.", "It has to be a cultural difference. I\u2019m from the Midwest USA & can\u2019t stress enough how much it would fuck up my familial relationships if I had a child free marriage. \n\nKids running around creating chaos at the reception is basically a critical part of the event in my family. Many skip the ceremony but entirely child free would be insane.", "It's not just paying for a sitter.\n\nIt's finding one.  \n\nIf you rely on family members to babysit normally, they're probably already at the wedding.  A teenage neighbor who will pick up a few hours here and there probably can't provide care for several days if you have to go out of town for a wedding, and their parents are apt to not want their teenage child to travel with you.  (Plus they have school, extracurricular activities, etc. to fit in, and may be mature enough to manage for a few hours in the afternoon or evening, but not for a longer stretch.)  \n\nIf you bring the kids to an out of town venue, and then have to find a sitter locally, you're not going to find people you know well enough to trust.  \n\nAnd if anything goes wrong, the parents will not just have to deal with the distress of a bad outcome for their child, but with the blame of others as to \"why did you trust this sitter?\"  \n\nPay is often only one of the concerns, and very far from being the most important concern, which is finding someone you trust 100%.  \n\nPlus, if you make parents leave their kids home, you can give up on saying \"turn off your phone during the ceremony.\"  If the babysitter calls, the parent needs to get the call, and answer.  Even if it is in the middle of your vows.  You change the types of disruption you can expect, but you don't eliminate the chance of disruption by the care that parents must provide their children.", "Lmao, i think so too. Although there was another account as well that acted quite butthurt when I called them out. Might be another one of OPs siblings lmao", "I\u2019m from the US too and none of my friends or family have kids at weddings. Northeast though. So maybe regional? I\u2019ve been to weddings on the west coast and it\u2019s the same. \n\nKids are running around crazy at every other family event, just not weddings. They are upscale, formal, and last late into the night. They are not the most child-friendly affairs. \n\nThat said I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything *wrong* with having kids at your wedding. It\u2019s just odd to me to think people would take a child free wedding to mean I hate your kids."]}
