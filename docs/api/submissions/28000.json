Everyone of thoes people were going to be at the wedding. My husband side of the family there isn't really any contact. My son is also deaf so it would have had to be someone who could communicate with him. I am a mother above everything else and I had to make sure my children would be safe and comfortable above anyone else's feelings. So I would have 100 percent stayed home from the wedding had they not changed it. \n\nUltimately you have to decide more who you want there to celebrate your day with you and out weigh that with not having children there.

And she never offered to pay, AND she went and bought about 50 dollars worth of cheap crap from winners as a gift instead of cash as we requested) It makes my blood boil to this day just thinking about it. I caved and allowed her kids to come and they were underdressed and bored the entire time, and about an hour into the reception she came into where the bridesmaids were hanging with a baby stroller and RAN OVER the back of my dress ripping the entire back of it. I had to safety pin the dress up all night because she ruined it, and her kids looked bored and just played outside all night causing her to have to leave early.

Other guests lived closer which was why the evening reception had an unauthorised child who ended up making her group leave early due to a tantrum with how late the reception ended.

Why not an age restriction in the other direction? \n\nmy conclusion is: I see a wedding as a family celebration, maybe second to \u201eyour day\u201c. As a family, I believe you should be inclusive, not exclusive.

When you're paying per head and there's no discount for kids, eliminating them is an easy way to shave off hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars, depending on how many kids your family and friends have. Secondly, there's also a growing norm that parents \u2013 more so friends than family \u2013 get to enjoy a night away from their children. \n\nBut I'd say that the biggest reason is easily the fact that I've noticed a huge spike in completely unsupervised kids at these parents. My partner and I have been to two weddings where kids have actually gotten into the alcohol. One had to have their stomach pumped. Mutual friends have had similarly bad experiences. The biggest fear for us isn't something like \"they might cry during the ceremony,\" it's the risk of *actual serious harm.*", ">I'm not sure how child-free weddings got so popular. \n\nMy guess is that it started getting popular around the time when people stopped being considerate where their kids were concerned. Used to be that kids were expected to sit quietly with a soft book or toy throughout a solemn event and parents would take a crying or disruptive child outside or to a crying room to settle them before returning... I have noticed lately that parents just give their kids a tablet/device without ear buds and allow them to use full volume regardless of the event... they allow them to run around and be disruptive without taking them out... \n\nIf you're trying to have a calm/peaceful event, you don't want a bunch of people with the entitled attitude that their kid can do no wrong bringing said child to that event...", "Because not everyone likes kids.", ">I'm not sure how child-free weddings got so popular\n\nCause they're better than those who have kids running and screaming.", "It\u2019s probably tied into the period when parents decided letting their children roam free like wild animals and never get scolded for a single thing for their \u201cmental well-being\u201d began.", "Kids still cost \ud83d\udcb2most people don\u2019t have an unlimited budget for their wedding", "What's selfish is to expect your sibling to cater to your wants for their wedding.", "Is this it though?

If you asked me about my birthday party it would be a different story lol", "> Like it or not, the people planning and paying for a wedding have the say\n\nSure, and rules for everyone else but not for them makes them hypocritical assholes.", "And OP shouldn\u2019t have to bear the burden of keeping her extended family happy, when they are determined to be unhappy if she doesn\u2019t do what they want.\n\nIf the siblings\u2019 discontent at this decision ends up causing problems for the cousins\u2019 relationship, down the line, that\u2019s her siblings\u2019 fault for passing along their feelings to their kids.", "OP already has kids, hence some of the family argument. Her kids are being allowed to attend.", "I have fun with my kids- At child friendly events, not formal, late night drinking events! \n\nOP has twins, that\u2019s like half the point of this post?", "That\u2019s not what the sister said, though. She thinks it\u2019s UNFAIR for the bride and groom to have their kids there when hers are not invited. It has nothing to do with babysitting.", "Lol it's a petty threat that's only coming up because her kids are going to the wedding 2hile theirs aren't. \n\nIf that wasn't the case they would have the sitter lined up and be attending. By not having her kids there it won't make their childcare needs magically easier. It's silliness.", "Ok. But I think that is totally an AH thing since the wedding it is not about them at all and they should prioritize their sister for one day and be happy for her.", "I mean, pretty much by definition, your siblings' kids ARE secondary. And then friends' kids are tertiary. All other children are after that. Your kids and your nieces/nephews are not the same thing.", "The wedding is a child free wedding. Not everything is about sibling's kids. What are you, the sister??", "Yes but that is not true and they would be the ah.", "But it's the same rule for all the guests. The siblings' children aren't being singled out. (And even if they were - it's up there with \"You can come, but don't bring your live-in MIL who gets drunk and screamy\").\n\nMore of an asshole move is to try to insert your children into someone's very special day where they aren't wanted; and burn down a relationship when you're told no.", "No, it doesn't. There is a material difference about inviting the direct nuclear family versus people who are one step removed. And in this case OP's kids are and *should be* a vital part of their wedding.", "How are they hypocritical? The only children in attendance would be the ones who\u2019s parents are getting married and they already have paid help for them in place. \nIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re letting select people being kids. That would be hypocritical.", "Yes. But she shouldn't be surprised if she's now forced to find new people to watch her kids when needed. I've literally seen this happen before.", "Almost every wedding I've ever been to has been child friendly. Even as a kid, attending weddings. The few childless ones I've been to were pretty boring, stuffy and full of cork sniffers. Those aren't really my kind of people anyway which is why I said alcohol is the only way to tolerate them. And OP might just have a problem finding friends and family to watch her twins now.", "She can fine it unfair or not - does not matter at all.\n\nAnd still not coming to an event that you are invited to is not a \u201cthreat\u201d, that\u2019s a ridiculous take no matter how much I get downvoted.\n\nIt\u2019s an invitation and not a subpoena, and if the conditions of the invitation don\u2019t match to what you can or want to do, then it\u2019s fine to say thank you, no thank you.", "I agree. The sister is the one being selfish and the AH.", "That's exactly what the discussion is about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Not accepting an invitation NEVER makes you an AH anyway.", "\"No, no-one can bring their kids. Except me\".\n\nThe definition of hypocrisy.", "Weddings in my area are child-free by default. Children being invited is the exceptions, usually limited to immediate family. And all weddings I\u2019ve been too have been fun! \n\nI\u2019m sure they have plenty of babysitters on their partners side of the family; it\u2019s only their side being unreasonable!", "I agree. It\u2019s not a threat to say if you don\u2019t do it my way then I\u2019m not coming. It\u2019s just being an AH and making it all about them.", "\u201cWedding police!  We have a warrant!\u201d", "No it\u2019s not. Child free weddings are a very normal thing. Bride is definitely not being an ah to anyone. Not going to a sister\u2019s wedding because of a selfish (and rare) principle is ah-ish.", "What it actually is is: \u201cNo guests can bring their children. The only children in attendance will be the children of the hosts.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no hypocrisy, all guests is getting treated the same. It is absolutely different when you are the child(ren) of the couple getting married versus someone who is being invited to attend.", "You must live somewhere pretty boujee, though. My circles are regular middle class and kids are almost always welcome We might also have a different idea on what is fun. She might also find half of her wedding empty.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. If your sister or another relative invites you to one of their over the top resort \u201cdestination\u201d weddings, and you don\u2019t happen to have a few thousand dollars lying around to attend it (or just don\u2019t want to spend it for that), then that does not make you an AH.\n\nBoundaries are not just for the bride to be. She can pick how she wants her wedding to be and her guests can pick if they want to attend or not - nobody is an AH for it.", "It's ok if you don't understand how hypocrisy works.", "I think I\u2019d rather have a half empty adult wedding than a pack of kids ruining it!"]}
