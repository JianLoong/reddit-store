Our relationship is great most times but she has a problem with certain friends of mine and she's always trying to argue about my friendship with them.\n\nOne of these friends, Anne, has been my friend for around 6/7 years. She's the only woman in our group (it's not a big group) since she's the only woman I hang out with my wife has always had an issue with her. I have always reassured my wife that nothing's going on between Anne and I, but she still has her doubts. \n\nQuite honestly I am an antisocial, I hang out with three other guys beside Anne so it is frequent that Anne and I hang out or something, but it's not because we're having an affair, it's because I don't have other friends. My wife is invited to hang with us if she wants to, but most times she prefers to stay home.\n\nOkay so the issue is that Anne's birthday is coming up soon, it's been a rough year for her so my other friends and I were planning to make a small surprise party for her. This is something that we're still planning so nobody else but us know it. \n\nMy friend Jacob is the one who's mostly planning the whole thing, he asked us to met up at a bar so we could talk about the party and catch up. My wife wanted to come, but as it is a surprise party I told her I was just gonna hang with Jacob because he needed to talk about something private. She dropped it after that because she said she understands. \n\nWe really went to the bar and discussed the matter for a while. Another friend, Matt, posted a photo of us on Instagram and Anne asked why were we hanging out without her, so Matt sent her a message to come with us since it was early.  We all hang out for a couple hours then we left. \n\nWhen I came back home my wife was watching a movie on Netflix, she asked me if everything was ok with Jacob and such. I answered very vaguely and went to the bathroom. I left my phone on my bedside table, my wife knows my pin access since I don't need to hide anything from her. Matt took a couple more photos while we were at the bar and then he sent it to our group chat while I was at the bathroom. My wife checked the phone and saw the photos. When I came out she was pissed and she asked me if I thought she was stupid or something, I was confused and said no, then she asked me why was I lying then. She told me she thought Jacob was sad and needed to talk but that I just sneaked out to hang with my friends and my \"side chick\" we started arguing because I was trying to explain to her what happened (minus the party thing), but she didn't want to listen. During our argument I called her \"control freak\" and \"jealous freak\" which only made things worse. \n\nI then had to sleep in the guest room. Now she won't really talk to me although I did apologized. I feel bad for the name calling, but also feel like she's being unfair.", "created_utc": 1681753046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pq6j9/aita_for_calling_my_wife_jealous_and_controlling/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You worded it so that she thought Jacob was going through a crisis or something and when she saw she was excluded (and others were there), she was rightfully upset.\n\n\nYTA.  You got caught in a lie and decided to double down and call her nasty things.  It's going to take a lot more than just an apology to get this one back.", "YTA. This is why:\n\n>My wife wanted to come, but as it is a surprise party I told her I was just gonna hang with Jacob because he needed to talk about something private\n\nYou don't trust your wife to keep the surprise party for a friend secret? I don't buy it.  Your wife thinks that you prioritize this woman over her - and from this alone, I'd say that she's right. You are keeping secrets from your wife unnecessarily - I wouldn't trust you either, given the sneaking around that you are doing.\n\nIf you were to draw a circle around yourself and the person closest to you, would that person be your wife?", "YTA for lying to your wife and then acting like she's \"jealous\" and \"controlling\" when she responds exactly as someone would when they've been lied to.\n\nHere's how surprise parties work--they are kept secret from the guest of honor, but everyone else knows about them.  Yes, it's not a perfect system and this is why they rarely end up being a surprise, but that's how you get the other people to show up, hide behind the couch for 15 minutes to 2 hours, and jump out and yell \"Surprise!,\" including on several false alarms. There was no good reason for you to hide your purpose in meeting with Jacob.  And given that your wife is already wary of your relationship with Anne, when Anne showed up, you probably should have given your wife a heads up about that, too (like, \"We almost got busted talking about the surprise party, guess who just showed up?\"). You definitely should have told her once people are posting on social media about it.\n\nIn other words, you acted suspicious at every turn and are now blaming her for viewing you as such. Don't be that guy.", "YTA, dude.\n\nYou lied to your wife for no reason at all (why would it matter if she knew you were planning a surprise party) and got caught doing so, and insulted her for it. How could you *possibly* think you're in the right here?\n\nAlso, frankly, it's hard to believe you're even telling us the truth when you invited *Anne* to her \"surprise\" party hangout.", "YTA. Not for your friendship with Anne, but because you're going about things so foolishly. Why would your wife not be allowed to go out and discuss Anne's surprise party? She's not the one who would be surprised. You are hiding things from her and lying to her. Of course she is suspicious of you.", "Dude for a married guy you spend way too much time with a \u2018side chick\u2019 your wife have problem with.  Choose one\n\nYour wife or the \u2018side chick\u2019\n\nWhen you need to sneak out to see side chick you know you done fucked something up", "YTA. She thinks you\u2019re lying to her about something and she\u2019s right, you were lying to her. Why couldn\u2019t she come to discuss the surprise party as well? You said yourself that she is welcome with your friends group so she should have been allowed to be in on the surprise. But instead you\u2019re giving her vague answers, lying to her and spending time with the woman who you know she has suspicions about. And now you\u2019re blaming her for acting accordingly and accusing her of being jealous and a \u2018control freak.\u2019 You\u2019re an AH and gaslighting her.", "YTA but not because your friends with Anne. Why did you lie to your wife about meeting up to plan the party? You said it's a surprise but it's supposed to be a surprise for Anne, not your wife so why couldn't she know??? If my husband lied about why he was going somewhere and then I found out he was doing something else I would be super suspicious too\n\nINFO- do you hang out with Anne alone? Or only with your other friends?", "You lied to her. YTA. \n\nNot a smart move. Now she will not believe you because she caught you lying already.", "Why didn't you just go sleep at your side chick Ann'es instead of the guest room?", "YTA\n\nSo you misled your wife about the reason for the hangout because you didn't want her to know about another person's surprise party. You then invited the person who the surprise was for to the hangout. And then you were deliberately \"vague\" about her being there.\n\nAnd you're surprised she finds this weird? Just about anyone would be suspicious when their spouse misled them multiple times.", "YTA - Not the way to dispel what sounds like a very legitimate concern by your wife. It doesn't sound controlling at all. Now, there might not be anything between you and Anne, but she might be catching feelings and your wife is picking up on that. **Your first duty is to your wife**, not Anne. Doesn't sound like she tries to control you in hanging out with your guy friends (or you would have mentioned it) so she's not a controlling person.", "YTA\n\nThere was no value added to keeping the birthday party a secret from your wife.\n\nYou chose to marry your wife, you signed a legally binding contract that includes responsibilities as well as the benefits- free and open communication is so important in a marriage you can't be forced to testify against each other.  There's no contract you can sign with a buddy that gives you that protection because *it's not important to speak freely to a buddy.*\n\nYou did lie to your wife, it might've been a stupid lie- but it's still a lie.  It sounds like you're prioritizing your buddies including Anne over your wife, just remember you signed a legally binding contract that you're on a team with your spouse- not your buddies.", "I love seeing OP get obliterated in the comments. And still trying to defend his stance on what went down. Hahahahahgaa YTA", "Let me get this straight. \n\n> I have always reassured my wife that nothing's going on between Anne and I, but she still has her doubts. \n\nSo you know your wife is uncomfortable with Anne for whatever reason. Was there ever a physical relationship between you two? \n\nKnowing your wife's discomfort you invite her to come along. Ok that's a good thing. \n\nNow we get to the party planning... \n\n>My friend Jacob is the one who's mostly planning the whole thing, he asked us to met up at a bar so we could talk about the party and catch up. My wife wanted to come, but as it is a surprise party I told her I was just gonna hang with Jacob because he needed to talk about something private. She dropped it after that because she said she understands.\n\nSo you LIED to your wife about what you were doing and she was OK with your explanation. That's NOT controlling or jealous. \n\nShe accepted that your friend had an issue that he needed to discuss privately with you.\n\nEven though there is no reasonable explanation why you should not have told her the truth. Why do you value your friends request over the relationship with your wife? This wasn't a privacy issue. Telling your wife that your friend wanted input on a surprise part wouldn't expose any of his private information. \n\nBut you chose to LIE to your wife and exclude her from your evening. \n\n>We really went to the bar and discussed the matter for a while. Another friend, Matt, posted a photo of us on Instagram and Anne asked why were we hanging out without her, so Matt sent her a message to come with us since it was early. We all hang out for a couple hours then we left. \n\nSo it wasn't just Jacob. Ok but when Anne became involved and the purpose of getting together shifted... why didn't you let your wife know? Why didn't you invite her to come down? Why hide that from your wife? \n\nAnd now pictures are being taken. \n\n>When I came back home my wife was watching a movie on Netflix, she asked me if everything was ok with Jacob and such. I answered very vaguely and went to the bathroom.\n\nSo when you got home you had a chance to explain what happened but you continued to try to keep up the LIE. \nKnowing that there were photos and knowing that you and your wife have an open phone policy. \n\n>When I came out she was pissed and she asked me if I thought she was stupid or something, I was confused and said no, then she asked me why was I lying then. She told me she thought Jacob was sad and needed to talk but that I just sneaked out to hang with my friends and my \"side chick\" we started arguing because I was trying to explain to her what happened (minus the party thing), but she didn't want to listen\n\nBECAUSE ITS OBVIOUS YOU ARE LIEING. \n\nYou lied to her about why you went out. And intentionally excluded her. \n\nYou lied to her about who was going to be there, indicating it was just you and one friend. \n\nYou lied to her about what happened when you got home. \n\nYou did not \"come clean\" until you were caught at which point YOU CONTINUED TO LIE TO HER. What excise did you give about what you were talking about before Ann was invited? \n\nThen when she gets justifiably upset about your lies you lash out at her and call her controlling and jealous? In what way was she controlling you through all this? \n\nWhy wouldn't she be jealous when you repeatedly lie to her and get caught? \n\nHow often do you LIE to your wife about your activities? \n\nYeah dude YTA \n\nStop prioritizing friends feelings over your wife's.", "YTA. You admit you had feelings for Anne in the past and think your wife is overly jealous and controlling even though she's been ok with you hanging out alone with her for years? Come on. If you want to do whatever you want with no regards to someone else's feelings you need to be single. It does sound like you prioritize your friends over your wife and that includes Anne. Btw, it's telling Matt, Jacob, and Anne get names but your wife does not. \n\nYou made the choice to lie numerous times throughout this and then went straight to verbal assaults when you were called out. And before anyone comes at me with calling her a jealous freak and a controlling freak isn't verbal assault, it is because he said it as an insult meant to manipulate her views of herself to shut the conversation down so he could keep control and continue to do what he wants.", "YTA. If my husband told me I couldn\u2019t come somewhere because his friend needed him and then I found out he was with a group of people (nevermind a woman he knew I had an issue with) I would be furious. You couldn\u2019t have just told the truth and said you guys were planning a surprise for your friends birthday and then they joined? Maybe she\u2019s jealous and untrusting because she has no reason to trust you. Your first instinct was to lie to her\n\nEdit: typo", "So let me get this straight;\n\nYou ied to your wife and it's okay for Anne to crash the \"surprise party\" meeting but not your wife.\n\nYou must understand that is kind of stupid. Why didn't you invite your wife do you even like her?\n\nYTA", "YTA lmao I dont understand how you dont think you are.", "YTA- you lied, why in the world would it matter if she knew about the surprise party or not? Unless you intend to not invite her.  You are causing more issues by hiding the party then telling her.   Plus you allow Annie to attend after but have refused to allow your wife to go to the same meet up.", "YTA \n\nYour sneakiness isn\u2019t going to help with your wife\u2019s insecurities or suspiciousness about you and Anne", "YTA  This is why you don't keep secrets from your wife!  She's not going to say anything about the surprise party and now you literally made it look like you are cheating and all your friends are in on it.", "YTA. You have been caught lying to your wife totally justifying her suspicions about you hanging out with Anne. I think you will have to choose.", "YTA. There is literally no reason to keep information about a surprise party for a third person from your wife. I can't see a single reason why you needed to keep this secret from her except to either intentionally exclude her, or to do something nefarious.\n\nYour communication skills are atrocious and they are the direct cause of all of the trust issues.\n\nGet into couples counseling and figure out your shit.", "YTA - You walked into that one.   You should have updated her as to what happened when you got home.   Your story and the photos didn't match.    It looked very fishy.", "YTA for lying to your wife. Why keep the surprise party secret from her? It was not for her but for Anne. You are lying and behaving in an off and suspicious manner for absolutely no reason. \n\nInfo: did she start by saying she thought Anne liked you? Or did you just assume she would think something was going on between Anne and you? I think your behaviour is also part of why your wife needs to be reassured you want to be with her. Emphasis on your wife and your relationship. Not keep making it about how you and Anne are not together while lying and sneaking around that involves her. \n\nReally dude, everyone should know about the surprise party except for the one who it is for!! What the f lie about something so stupid?!?", "YTA.\n\nYou told your wife she couldn't come because you were talking about a surprise party  but then hung out with the recipient of said surprise party??  Yeah that's pretty shady, you should have told your wife that Anne had been invited and then invited your wife as well. It definitely reads as sus that you conveniently didn't mention it.\n\nAlso opposite-sex friendships are a common trust issue with marriages. If your priority lies with your wife you should listen to her when she says she's uncomfortable with how much you hang out alone with a female friend.  You don't have to drop your friend,  but you could also make an effort to put your wife's mind at ease with compromises. The dismissive attitude isn't helping your case. It almost seems as if you may not be telling us the whole story here.", "YTA. You were being dishonest with your wife, even if not for the reasons she suspects. And then you call her a \u201ccontrol freak\u201d and a \u201cjealous freak\u201d when she legitimately caught you being dishonest? I\u2019m with your wife on this one. Even if you and Anne are completely platonic, you\u2019re acting shady and not fully including your wife, which of course is going to play into her suspicions.", "YTA there was no need to lie to your wife. And if you felt the need it's because you feel guilty for something. You sure nothings happened over the years??\nAlso just a question? How could you marry someone who dislikes your friends? Seems strange.", "YTA and this folks, is a perfect example of men having all the audacity.", "She is your life partner, and should be your best friend. There is no reason to have kept this from her. She should be able to keep a secret like a surprise party. She uncomfortable with your relationship, and this most likely made it worse. Be honest with your wife and include her in the planning, it will probably help her become more comfortable with Anne and make her not feel like an outsider.", "YTA\n\nYes, you can have friends of the opposite sex and the same orientation but if a partner is uncertain then you need to take the necessary steps to make them feel secure, which is being open with when and where you are hanging out and keeping them in the loop instead of keeping info from them and isolating them.\n\nSeriously, you know she is unsure you could have said \"Me and Jacob are planning a surprise for Anne. Because she's had a rough year, we'd like to do this on our own keep it to her closest friends I'll be at X and be home at X\"\n\nEven if say Anne confided in you about something you couldn't share you can still say \"Anne confided something in me she really doesn't want to share which is why I can't talk about it.\n\nBetter yet you could have also added something like \"If you want to help that's great! I'll let you know if there is anything you can do\"\n\nIt doesn't sound like you are fully addressing your girlfriend's insecurity, other than \"I'm not interested in her\" instead of sitting down and saying \"I understand you are concerned, I can see why you might feel that way what can we do you so you feel secure and I can still see my friend\"", "Bro did you just lie to your wife about hanging out with the very women she's insecure about then call her names after and then ask internet strangers if you were an asshole or not? Please get better at self reflection. \n\nThat woman is the person you're supposed to ride or die with. Telling her about something as small as a surprise birthday party is nothing..\n\nYTA.", "Info: do you plan surprise parties for your wife? Do you make enough of an effort to do these kinds of things for your wife? Do you lie to her about Anne often? \n\nI have to be honest and say that the \u201ccrazy jealous wife\u201d trope doesn\u2019t happen as often as men make it seem. Your wife is upset that you prioritize another woman and when she vocalizes that to you, you villainize her.", "YTA- why would you not tell your wife about the surprise party you are planning?  And then invite Anne, who the party is being planned for?  How stupid do you think your wife is?", "You\u2019re the ah. \nThere\u2019s more to all this or you\u2019re just a top of the line asshole. The wife thinks you have more intimate feelings for Anne. you\u2019ve not shown her there\u2019s not clearly. You lied to her. I don\u2019t thinks she\u2019s a control freak I think she\u2019s fed up of feeling unimportant. Pick one. go low contact with Anne or admit your feelings to yourself and let your wife find happiness. I love my friends but my spouses feelings are first.", "YTA. You lied to your wife and then told her she was controlling. Like it takes 5 seconds to say \"Hey Anne got invited. I'm sorry about that. I thought it was going to be something else. If you want, you're welcome to come out.\" But you didn't. And then when she asked how it went, you still didn't tell her. You were deliberately vague. And then when she found out and was understandably upset at you, you called her a control freak and a jealous freak.\n\nYour behavior is terrible.", "YTA! How many times have you prioritized Anne over your wife during the course of your relationship? I do not think she's insecure, I think you've given her plenty of reasons as to why she doesn't like your relationship with Anne. This was a stupid move. Unless the surprise party is for your wife, you tell your spouse about this so you don't raise suspicions. Your friends are idiots who encouraged you to lie to your wife, and you listened to them. \n\nThen, instead of apologizing and telling her what's up immediately, you call her names. You need to start prioritizing your wife, dude. Otherwise, have fun being single.", "YTA for lying and now she won't trust you even more so, right or wrong. \n\nYou guys both sound immature.", "> she has a problem with certain friends of mine and she's always trying to argue about my friendship with them.\n\nInfo: Why does your wife argue about your friendship with these friends, or is it just about Anne?", "Your wife deserves better.

YTA", "YTA you\u2019re lying to her and she can tell. She isn\u2019t jealous and controlling you are actively lying and gas lighting her since your 100% being dishonest and she can tell.

YTA.", "YTA- no if, ands, or buts... yta.", "YTA, you lied. You expect your wife to trust your relationship/ friendship with Anne after you lied? If she was fine or on the fence before, you've only compounded the problem. You don't keep secrets from your partner even if your friends ask you to. \nShe'll probably never trust that friendship again, and why would she? You've lied about it once. Why wouldn't you lie again?", "YTA for lying about why you were going out. When a spouse in planning a surprise party the only reasons to hide it from their S.O. is because 1) they are the guest of honor, or 2) they'll tell the GOH. Unless your wife is miserably spiteful, she would have no reason to spill the beans to Anne - did you actually fear that? Sometimes you not only have to do the right thing, you have to APPEAR to be doing the right thing. You know your wife is jealous of Anne so you should always do and appear to be doing the right thing concerning her. Lying to your wife and then lashing out at her when she found out some details and got upset (rather than explain either time) makes you a double AH. You need to learn better communication skills and how to respect your wife.", "YTA\n\nYou lied to your wife because your friend told you to. Not ok.

I get you knew your wife wouldn\u2019t be excited about you planning a surprise party for her favorite person Anne (sarcasm), but you made it so much worse by hiding it. You justified all of her suspicions. Your wife sounds immature and insecure but you are also immature. You should have been upfront.

Good luck.", "[deleted]", "Your wife is obviously feeling jealous and insecure. Surely you can empathize, everyone has these feelings at some point. Is it rational? From what you've said, probably not. You aren't TA for this. But you shouldn't have misled your wife about what would be discussed at the bar.... talk about giving her reason to be distrustful. \n\nYou have shot yourself in the foot in my opinion. She will be even more insecure now that she found out you misled her. \n\nHonesty may be more difficult in the moment, but much easier in the long run. \n\nBest of luck, sounds like a very normal relationship with some things to work on over time :)\n\nEdit for judgement: soft YTA", "ESH, you all act like you're 15.", "NTA\n\nI cannot get my head around partners who behave so jealously of their partners friends. If there's no trust, what's the point in being together?", "ESH. You were needlessly sneaky (why can't your wife know about the plans for Anne's party?), but honestly when she referred to Anne as your \"side chick\" then it was fair game to say what you said. I'm not sure how to fix it all, though.", "ESH. You need to apologize to your wife for the name-calling. Suggest that the two of you go to couples counseling as the Anne issue is becoming a major problem in your marriage. \n\nAnd for the love of Pete, just tell your wife about the surprise party already. No need to be mysterious when you know your wife already has trust issues around your friends. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re reasonable, mind you. But more transparency is needed, not less.", "ESH. She does sound like a \"jealous control freak,\" but you lied to her, which also isn't cool. I know you'll say you have your reasons, but you still lied.", "ESH. I don't know your wife, so it's perfectly plausible that she's on to something or is sensitive to a spark between you and Anne. However, as a rule, jealous and controlling is a heady mix of disaster for most relationships. She needs counseling to sort out her trust issues.\n\nAll that being said, you are also an AH for what you did. So what if it was a meeting to plan a surprise party for Anne? What were the odds that your wife would tell Anne and ruin the surprise? Your reasoning does not add up to me, so I'm not surprised your wife doesn't believe you.\n\nAsk any decent clinical psychologist/therapist/counselor and they'll tell you that with the jealous, paranoid types Rule #1 is to never lie--and that includes lying by omission. Most people like that are fantastic at sniffing out BS, and when they catch a whiff of it, it only confirms that their behavior is the correct response to their feelings of insecurity. I'm assuming that you value this relationship because you married her, otherwise the wise thing would be to run. If you are willing to work on it, tell her the truth, even if it causes conflict.

I'm guessing this is just adding onto all of the other times she thought you were having a fling with this girl, so she is all up in a tizzy over it.\nIt's okay to have female friends, but it's not okay for her to be so jealous over them if nothing is going on.  All she is doing is creating chaos and anxiety in the relationship AND in her own head!!  She needs to get over this.  \nSit next to her and give her a very heartfelt apology for this ONE act.

Either way, there was no need to voice either, though I assume this was  heat of the moment thing, and you've already apologized appropriately for the name calling.  I would NEVER apologize for the other activities because it only confirms in her mind that she was right.

Our relationship is great most times but she has a problem with certain friends of mine and she's always trying to argue about my friendship with them.\n\nOne of these friends, Anne, has been my friend for around 6/7 years. She's the only woman in our group (it's not a big group) since she's the only woman I hang out with my wife has always had an issue with her. I have always reassured my wife that nothing's going on between Anne and I, but she still has her doubts. \n\nQuite honestly I am an antisocial, I hang out with three other guys beside Anne so it is frequent that Anne and I hang out or something, but it's not because we're having an affair, it's because I don't have other friends. My wife is invited to hang with us if she wants to, but most times she prefers to stay home.\n\nOkay so the issue is that Anne's birthday is coming up soon, it's been a rough year for her so my other friends and I were planning to make a small surprise party for her. This is something that we're still planning so nobody else but us know it. \n\nMy friend Jacob is the one who's mostly planning the whole thing, he asked us to met up at a bar so we could talk about the party and catch up. My wife wanted to come, but as it is a surprise party I told her I was just gonna hang with Jacob because he needed to talk about something private. She dropped it after that because she said she understands. \n\nWe really went to the bar and discussed the matter for a while. Another friend, Matt, posted a photo of us on Instagram and Anne asked why were we hanging out without her, so Matt sent her a message to come with us since it was early.  We all hang out for a couple hours then we left. \n\nWhen I came back home my wife was watching a movie on Netflix, she asked me if everything was ok with Jacob and such. I answered very vaguely and went to the bathroom. I left my phone on my bedside table, my wife knows my pin access since I don't need to hide anything from her. Matt took a couple more photos while we were at the bar and then he sent it to our group chat while I was at the bathroom. My wife checked the phone and saw the photos. When I came out she was pissed and she asked me if I thought she was stupid or something, I was confused and said no, then she asked me why was I lying then. She told me she thought Jacob was sad and needed to talk but that I just sneaked out to hang with my friends and my \"side chick\" we started arguing because I was trying to explain to her what happened (minus the party thing), but she didn't want to listen. During our argument I called her \"control freak\" and \"jealous freak\" which only made things worse. \n\nI then had to sleep in the guest room. Now she won't really talk to me although I did apologized. I feel bad for the name calling, but also feel like she's being unfair.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. \n\nWhy not just tell your wife you're throwing a party for Anne? It's not meant to be a surprise for your wife. I don't think just being friends with a woman is reason enough to assume someone is having an affair, but if you're sneaking around and lying about things that you could easily just be upfront about, it's no wonder she doesn't trust you. And to have the gaul of telling your wife she's a control freak after you told her she couldn't come because it was just you and Jake and then spend the whole evening hanging out with all your friends and posting it on social media.", "YTA for refusing to disclose the surprise party as if your wife couldn\u2019t keep a surprise.  \nWhen you leave too many blanks to fill in, people fill it in for you. \nYou told her a friend needed privacy then hung out with a group of friends minus your wife.  You basically got caught lying yet still can\u2019t mention the surprise party.  I imagine it\u2019s because your wife will get more upset knowing you were lying to throw your side chick a party.", "I would love to know both sides as I don't know if you're telling the full story. There has to be a reason why your wife is uncomfortable with Anne. She probably noticed something that you didn't or probably dismissed. But I understand her reaction - it hurts to be lied to. I am not sure if she's truly jealous or controlling, but something you did or what Anne did must have paved way for your wife to feel this way. And now being sneaky only added more uncertainty. \n\nIt's hurtful that you were being sneaky and omitting details and then accusing her of being jealous and controlling.", "YTA, you lied, all of this could have been avoided but you lied to your wife. My wife and I have one rule and its not even a rule just a way we live, if someone says \"don't tell anyone\" that never includes the SO. You should have told her knowing she already feels some type of way.", "OP . YTA and clearly need reading comprehension. You stated that you have had feeling for Anne in the past (far past I believe you said). That right there is why your wife has these feelings. Stop lying to your wife regarding Anne or she will always be suspicious. It does not matter that your friend asked you not to tell your wife about planning the surprise party. You aren\u2019t married to your friend. You should have told her. And you should h e texted your wife \u201chey just so you know some friends are showing up, including Anne\u201d that\u2019s how you keep both women yin your life.", "YTA just accept that bro that u are in love with anna and don't have enough courage to perseu her u sound sus as hell sure your wife deserve better than this", "YTA. You made no sense you say your wife is invited to hang out with you guys but with this surprise party now she's not invited? And why did you feel the reason to lie? I would need to hear the other side of the story because I think there is more than what you're telling.", "Probably should have just told your wife you were planning a surprise party with Jason and then, you know, let her come.   \nYTA there.  \nYour friends posting pictures of the \"secret planning meeting\" deserves an honorable mention for not thinking things through, too.   \n\n\nYour wife might have jealousy issues and that's bad, but, like, you're feeding them by being dishonest or secretive needlessly.  Why the fuck would you need to keep the party secret from your wife?  Wtf were you thinking?", "YTA. You lied and destroyed your wife\u2019s trust. Good luck fixing it. Have fun with the side chick.", "OP you need to update us on why your wife and Jacob and the rest of the friends got into the fight/dislike earlier on", "YTA. You said you were just hanging with Jacob to discuss something private. You were in fact hanging with Jacob and Matt to discuss the party whilst being out and Anne ended up joining you. There\u2019s a difference. You lied to your wife. A surprise party doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t tell your wife. This is the kind of behaviour that plants seeds of mistrust. If you\u2019re lying about something so innocuous then how is your wife supposed to trust that the other things you say are true.", "YTA, and I\u2019m having a really difficult time understanding why you would even have to ask if you were/weren\u2019t in this particular circumstance.\n\n1) you met Jacob under false pretense- you lied to wife and said that you needed to meet him alone about something private, to avoid having to bring her along.  You then proceeded to gather your four buddies together and have a grand old time while you left your wife at home. \n\n2) THEN, you accuse her of being a control freak because she is justifiably upset because she caught you in the aforementioned lie.  And you wonder why she doesn\u2019t trust you.", "YTA you literally admitted to sneaking around and lying. You gave her the proof she needed. \ud83d\ude35", "YTA. If you know your wife is insecure about your relationship with Anne, why wouldn\u2019t you just invite her to the bar after Anne showed up? You either knew you would have a better time without her there, or didn\u2019t want her to find out at all. Either way it\u2019s an issue.", "YTA", "This seems like you created this post to cover your tracks.  There is no reasonable explanation why you 1) couldn't have told your wife the truth in the first place; 2) couldn't have just owned up to other friends coming when you got home; 3) couldn't have invited your wife once it turned into a group hang; 4) invited someone to a meet up to plan THEIR OWN surprise party; 5) had to hide this from your wife while your bros were posting pictures about it on social media.\n\nYTA and probably a bigger YTA for bullshitting this post.", "I hope his wife leaves him. She deserves better. YTA", "YTA", "Why are you even asking if you're TA or not? Like... is there anywhere in this that leaves you doubting? Come on, man...\n\n1. You lied to your wife\n2. You did so, because you don't trust her\n3. You didn't invite her, because the secret you kept from her was for a surprise party for this woman, who was also there.\n4.

You somehow can't put that together in your head and understand you're not just the asshole, but you're an asshole.\n\nMake this make sense... like there is literally no possible way to spin this so that you look guilt free, or that your wife is TA, let alone both, and you still feel the need to ask.\n\nBro... get help... fast.. cause if you don't, you're getting a divorce. And if you don't, I'm questioning her judgement.", "ESH, you for not telling the truth, that always goes bad and name calling. Her for being so insecure but especially for going through your phone. You could have avoided this by just telling the truth. Now your wife is even more insecure and that\u2019s on you.", "Yeah, his wife can't come because they're planning a surprise party, but the girl he's going to all this trouble to plan a party for can?", "Seriously, all this could have been solved if OP just told her about the damn party...", "Yeah there is a level of between-friends secret I would potentially keep from my spouse, if asked to - generally I tell him everything but I can make an exception. You just found out about a secret child, or scary diagnosis, or you're deliberating whether or not to leave your spouse and don't want anyone to know yet? If you ask me to, I'll keep that to myself and not tell my spouse. A surprise birthday party for the girl he's telling her not to worry about does not rise to that level.", "I also want to know why OP couldn\u2019t have invited his SO out after the convo when Anne got invited. Does OP even like his SO?", "Yeah.... why couldn't your wife know about a surprise party that is (1) not for her and (2) she seemingly doesn't even talk to the person that it for.... But you let the person come who it is actually for. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nNormally I would say that your wife is the asshole because this friend was there before she was.... However, you were being awfully suspicious with this situation and in this instance I don't blame your wife for questioning you.", "OP:  You told her she couldn't come along because you had to discuss something really *secret* and *private* and then when she asked you about it later you evaded her questions.  Then she sees pictures of you partying with all your friends?????  Any reasonable person would be upset by that!   It really makes it look like you were lying about Jacob so you could spend time with Anne without her around - there is no other clear reason.  \n\nFrankly, you had one shot of fixing this and that was admiting when you got home that everyone ended up showing up and hung out in a group.  But you didn't- that was your biggest lie and biggest mistake.  You didn't want her to know you hung out with all your friends when she had wanted to come along - you knew on some level that it was a shifty, shitty thing to do and you kept it from her.  If she had no reason at all to get upset you would have told her about it.", "Guess who is on track for a divorce if you don\u2019t get couple therapy SOON! You broke your spouse\u2019s trust, and lied to her face and expect her to be ok with that?!? You need to sit back and take a good long look at yourself before you do anything else. YTA!", "Seriously - I was with N T A until I read this part and was like.. oh, now it makes sense why his wife is like this.\n\nEdit: and OP had a thing for the friend years ago..", "That's what I'm wondering, too.  Why didn't OP just tell her what they were doing?  He feels the need to lie about Anne because she is so jealous over her that having ANYTHING to do with her creates controversy.  That's a downhill spiral right there!", "My friends asked me to bot tell her yet, but eventually she'll know", "She's not my side chick and she wasn't even part of the original plan, she tagged along later", "We rarely hang alone, tbh I rarely hang with friends at all since I work and so do them, we hang out together every once in a while and Anne and I sometimes hang together but it's not something usual and most times my wife can come too if she wants to", "Right, especially since the lie was needless.", "Yeah, I highly doubt his wife will believe that she caught him in the one and only lie he's told her, especially since he lied to her to get her to stay home and then *just so happened to spend the evening out at a bar with another woman*. OP, you seem sketchy AF. Your wife isn't insecure, you're just a liar.", "Thank you. He's shady all across the board and then wants to know why she gets a shady vibe from him.", "Good response", "I'm just scrolling to see if there are any that say he is nta. So far nope.", "Apparently OP \u201chad a thing\u201d for Anne in the past, according to one of their comments.

Jacob and her had a small fight when we first started dating and my other friends took his side, her problem with Anne is that she's a woman and she thinks she likes me although she doesn't and it's been years since I've had a thing for her.", "Jacob doesnt like his wife. Op didnt explain why. I wouldnt be surprised if jacob wants to get rid of wife", "He did lie to her though. He told her a friend was having a rough time and that's why she couldn't come. He's still not telling her about the surprise party, which surely he has no reason to lie to her about.", "How can she trust him when he lies to her face??", "I don't think it's jealousy, I think it's the lying about why he went out. She wanted to come but as he was planning a surprise party (that wasn't for her?) he told a lie. What's the reason for lying? \n\nHe told her he was meeting one friend to talk about something private, just them two and then she finds out it was a bit of a social event with others and he just didn't want her to come.", "Not friends. Just this one. Seems like a legitimate cause for concern.", "I agree with you.  I'd be frustrated if he ONLY hung out with her and made plans to go do things together, but I see nothing wrong with having a female friend.  Especially if she is part of the group.  He definitely screwed up with this tiny white lie, but his wifes jealousy has caused this to be bigger than necessary.", "I mean, from his wife's perspective he lied to her about hanging out with another woman, then made an obvious lie about *why* he lied. \"Surprise party planning\" might be accurate, but there's no way to convince anybody he snuck off to plan a surprise party *for one of the people he's having beers with*. I don't really think his wife is off base here.", "What did the wife do to suck in this situation?", "According to OP, it sounds like the only concern is Anne, not his time with his other friends. That's pretty normal and not controlling.", "OP admits to having \u201chad a thing\u201d for Anne.  This didn\u2019t come up of nowhere.", "OP admitted that he \u201chad a thing\u201d for Anne.  Wife has reason to be suspicious.  And it\u2019s \u201cwomen\u201d, not \u201cfemales\u201d, thankyewverymuch.", "It's ok to me because I'm not hiding anything, I don't care if she checks my texts", "OP admits they \u201chad a thing\u201d for Anne, so it looks like OP HAS given his wife a reason to believe he\u2019s one of those \u201csimple minded people\u201d.", "Politics, wife is not a trump supporter but agrees with some of his politics, Jacob hates him and his politics, they argued because of that", "OP is the movie character that just shouts, \"I can explain,\" over and over again without ever explaining.", "Yeah but even with that stuff most people explain it like \"\\*blank\\* told me something in confidence and asked that I not share it with anyone. If a time comes when I can share it with you I will.\"", "Why did your friends not want her to know? \n\nWouldn't you be excited to tell your wife that you're planning this surprise party for a close friend?", "Why? Also, why are your friends so much more important to you than your wife?", "You lied to her so she will not trust you again. This is your fault.", "So what your friends want is more important to you than not lying to your wife, making her feel left out and betrayed and then you call her jealous and controlling?

But she is already insecure about my relationship with Anne, if I hide something like this it will make it worse\"\n\nPrioritizing your wife doesn't mean abandoning you're friends but what she is asking for is some really basic simple stuff. Like letting her know about a surprise party when your friends would rather she not now, telling your wife \"hey my hang out with my friend turned into a group thing with Anne just letting you know\" or hell INVITING HER TO JOIN AT THAT POINT. Sometimes you got to do a little extra like an extra txt message here and there that seems unnecessary.", "That's when you should have picked up the phone and got your wife to join you. Or gone home. \n\nAnything else is more or less broadcasting that you lie to your wife to be with Anne.", "When you get to the point where you're misleading your spouse about the time you spend with her, she's your side chick even if things aren't physical.", "You\u2019re an ah. But lay it out clearly . Your wife has a hard time with your relationship with Anne. You don\u2019t care your choice your friend. You could have invited your wife  out and she would know you\u2019re working on a surprise for Anne with friends . Clearly she isn\u2019t going to tell anne. Then you lied. Don\u2019t sugar coat it .That is questionable behavior. But she\u2019s just a friend. \u2026 right. Then anne ends up coming out and instead of leaving because you know\u2026 you had already lied to your wife about who you were with and now you\u2019ll be spending time with someone she has a hard limit with you stayed. When she was understandably upset you attacked her character. \nThere\u2019s more to all this or you\u2019re just a top of the line asshole. The wife thinks you have more intimate feelings for Anne. you\u2019ve not shown her there\u2019s not clearly. I don\u2019t thinks she\u2019s a control freak I think she\u2019s fed up of feeling unimportant. Pick one. go low contact with Anne or admit your feelings to yourself and let your wife find happiness. I love my friends but my spouses feelings are first.", "Youre never ever ever going to convince your wife anne isnt the side chick", "You said in your post you hung out with Anne frequently", "\u2026except for when she asks to, and you tell her she can\u2019t, lie to her about why, and then wind up inviting Anne and the whole group anyway.", "You didn't answer the question about why you didn't tell your wife that you were planning the surprise party. Its a surprise party for Anne not your wife why wouldn't you just tell your wife. Also Anne sounds pushy if I saw pics of 2 of friends doing something I would never ask why I wasn't invited. Never invite yourself somewhere, people just feel obligated to say yes. If people really want you there they would have already asked/offered, doing what Anne did to me is a bit rude.", "And that's probably at the root of the issue. \n\nI have no problem with my husband bring friends with his former flames but he is honest with me about it. \n\nIf I found out he was lying and hid seeing them I would be forced to consider why.", "Well you also say she is allowed to go through your phone but then when she does and finds out you lied to her, you get to insult her? Come on, man.....", "Well, since that's the only thing you got from my comment it still stands. Anne was more important to you to name. Rather than write my female friend and my wife Anna you gave Annes name and just let your wife be nameless. You could have even written Anne and Annabelle. You chose not to write your wifes name out but did so for each of your friends and there is a reason for that and it showed who was more of a priority to you.", "Yeah man, I would think you were cheating too, at least emotionally. If you can plan something for a friend you should at least be able to do the same if not better for the person you married. Not being romantic is A) not a very good excuse and B) not cutting it anymore. Your wife should be above all the other people in your life. Smarten up.", "If she doesn't like your friends why would she want to hang out with them?\n\n... and there it is. So you have had a thing for Anne and I'm assuming your wife (still nameless) knows about this? Depending on if your wife is insecure or not - in her mind she may think that one day Anne will have romantic feelings for you (I mean, your wife loves you, why wouldn't someone else? She thinks you're a great guy!) and basically steal you away from her. Despite being married, she knew you once had feelings for her and they just weren't returned, so why would you not take the offer and something you couldn't have before? \n\nThis is when it's your job as a husband to be honest with her, moreso when things come up with Anne, to make her realise that your wife is the one you want to be with, not Anne. So stop lying about things when Anne is involved. Don't you want them *both* in your life?", "So you had a thing for Anne in the past and are now lying to your wife about the meet up and wondering why she is mad and upset. You need to tell your friends the new rule is you tell me something you are telling my wife too, because I will not tell her what is said to me. And you are putting your friend above someone who you vowed to put before all others. If you friends and what they want is so much more important than your wife and her feeling comfortable in your relationship you never should have gotten married", "U still have that thing for her lmao", "Oh, so it really seems like you lied to your wife to sneak out and spend the night with a woman you \"had a thing for\". \n\nYTA. Honestly this whole friendship seems inappropriate.", "wait...so you had a thing for Anne so many years back?! i think this is a situation that could cost your marriage. It seems that your wife feels that she is not your #1 priority. And rightfully so. I would recommend going to a couple counselling to work thru this. But only if your marriage is actually important to you.", "This honestly is very concerning to me and sounds like a red flag. Your wife doesn't like any of your friends? What did Jacob start a fight about? There's a lot of missing information and context.", "LOL and there it is. You should have included that you once had feelings for Anne, but you didn't because you knew it would make you look bad.\n\nYTA", "I'm not surprised that your wife doesn't like Jacob. After all, look at him now - asking you to keep Anne's party secret from your wife. Why?  You still shut your wife out even when Anne was there: again, why?\n\nWould your wife be attending? Or are you planning it for a date that your wife can't attend?", "Because of a situation that developed completely unexpectedly in order not to give away the surprise birthday party.\n\nIf a stranger can understand that, so can his wife.\n\nI would reverse my judgement if there were any indication that there's been a romantic or sexual relationship between OP and his friend, or any other cheating during his relationship with his wife.", "If we are taking his narration at face value, it seemed it was a planning meeting that morphed. I agree it would have been easier to just tell her but I can understand the extinct of not wanting to incite another round of jealous craziness. \n\nShrug, I think they are perhaps incompatible in their respective boundaries about platonic friendships with the opposite sex.", "How so, because of her gender?\n\nHe's explained he had 4 friends, one of whom is female.\nShe's not an ex partner of his, and from what he's said, NOTHING has ever happened", "Exactly, her jealousy sounds exhausting", "He was clearly a dipshit about the whole thing, but if you're not having an affair and your partner accuses you of having an affair, then -- stupid or not -- shit is going to get said. Hence, ESH.", "The lack of trust that the wife has in their relationship is sucky imo.\n\n While this is of course a one sided view, OP doesn't indicate any behaviour that makes it seem like he has feelings for Anne. Having a woman as friend should not be an issue and the wife assuming there has to be something more and checking his phone _is_ controlling\n\n\nEdit: my verdict is also ESH", "To me, it hasn\u2019t been proven that her suspicions are justified. Maybe she\u2019s on to something, but maybe she\u2019s paranoid due to a lack of self-confidence/esteem. It\u2019s gotten the best of her causing her to be controlling and sneaky (i.e. snooping in OP\u2019s phone). This doesn\u2019t seem to be a tenable situation for either of them.", "Yeah but sounds like the friends are a package deal. If he cuts out Anne he doesn\u2019t get to see the others much.", "She doesn't like my other friends either", "Not sure what your point here is. OP lied to her. The fact that she went through his phone when he was out of the room is extremely controlling and definitely not normal.
