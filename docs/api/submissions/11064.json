I have begged my brother for, literally, years to put that in writing, but typical, he never did anything. \n\nYesterday my mom received an eviction notice from my ex SIL. It is a very bitter and hard pill to swallow for my mom since my grandma just died. \n\nBut here's the thing, I am fortunate to have money to buy my mom's house , cash, but my exSIL is so bitter towards my brother she has told me numerous times she will never sell it to any of us, she rather burn the property. I have begged my mom to move out, I can buy a different house but she has lived in that house for 20 years, my dad and grandma passed in that house and she doesn't want to move. I refuse to hire a lawyer to get my mom out of this one, I will pay for a house, but I won't fight the eviction or pay uselessly to attempt to get this house for her. My brother is now , SUPPOSEDLY, suing my ex SIL, but who knows .\n\nAnyway, my niece's sweet 16 is approaching. I don't have a super close relationship with her anymore because her mother doesn't really allow her to be with us that much. She's also a teen and not very interested in family. I know she has nothing to do with this, and I will give her a gift, but my brother and my ex SIL expect me, and even promised her that I would get her a big gift, like a car or to pay for her party, and I just don't want to do it. I have money, yes, I could do it, yes,  but I am not going to use my money on their kid when I have to buy my mom a house. If I'm honest, there's also a lot of resentment over having to be dragged into this mess and I feel I don't want anything to do with that entire \"family\".

Otherwise, the trouble goes on and on.", "NTA. Your niece deserves absolutely nothing from you.  I would never expect my aunt to purchase me a car or throw me a party", "NTA\n\nGifts aren't obligatory.  You coukd decide to give no gift at all and you still wouldn't be an AH.\n\nIf you want to give her a gift, give what you feel like giving.\n\nBrother and ex SiL are the AHs for promising a big gift from you. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter if you can give a big gift, you aren't obligated to. And you don't have to make good on promises someone else made on your behalf. \n\nBut frankly I'm more concerned with your mother's housing situation than your niece's gift.", "NTA. Your ex SIL sounds like a very troubled person. She is in no position to make promises of gifts to her daughter on your behalf. You don\u2019t need to pay or gift anything you don\u2019t want to. \n\nNote: If your niece is living with ex SIL, then I\u2019d check up on her just to make sure that nasty behavior isn\u2019t escalating towards her daughter behind the scenes. Just a suggestion. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your grandma.", "NTA.    They can buy her a car and pay for the party.\nMom would somehow take the car anyway", "None of this cluster is of your making or in your control.  Not your circus, not your monkeys.  \n\nSave your money, let your mom fight it out with your brother, let your brother fight it out with his ex.  Don\u2019t give anyone any money.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anybody a penny. If you aren\u2019t close enough to your niece to talk to her about the gift, then you\u2019re not close enough to be expected to drop that kind of money. Send her a normal gift, or if you\u2019d like to do more you can set up some kind of financial gift her parents can\u2019t access and she can\u2019t touch until 18+.", " NTA\n\nIt\u2019s really presumptuous of your bro and ex sil to tell your niece you would buy her a car?! Or even worse that you\u2019d pay for her party?!! \n\nThey are her parents, if they want her to have these things, they can buy them. \n\nIf bro and ex own both homes why did they not divide them at the time of the divorce? \n\nThis is your bro\u2019s fight to fight. I wouldn\u2019t do anything either. He made this mess, he can figure it out. \n\nIn the event mom is forced to get out, then you can discuss with mom where she wants to live and if that means buying her a house then you do it.", "NTA - Buying your niece a car seems like an awful lot to start with not withstanding this cluster fuck of a situation y'all have going on. I would NOT be buying her a car. Sure do something nice but sub $500 max.....", "Ten years, wow. That's ten years of being bitter with someone who used to love each other, that's really sad.\n\nAnyway, NTA no gift is compulsory or expected.", "NTA\u2026lawyer up and try to enforce the verbal contract.  Your mom has attachment to that home and doesn\u2019t want to leave. Sadly your SIL isn\u2019t interested in selling to the family\u2026kind of crazy that her and your brother expect you to get your niece a car\u2026the entitlement is mind blowing.", "NTA and not unreasonable. Through your brother\u2019s negligence and your family\u2019s inability to come together for solutions to a problem that affects them, you are left looking like an AH through no fault of your own. It\u2019s not fair to you. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have money. You are not obligated to get substantial gift for a child that isn\u2019t your own. She is your niece, so family, but still isn\u2019t your responsibility. Get her a nice gift that reflects her interests or a generic gift w/ a gift receipt. That is more than enough. Hope things with your mother work out.", "NTA  Tell her since there is a conflict over your Mom and the house, you cant in good faith give any gift of that size to your niece.", "NTA - but come on dude this is way above our pay grade here on reddit. Hire a lawyer!", "NTA. You said you're not close with your niece so even without all the other drama it would be pretty weird for you to be plopping down $50K on a car or lavish party. Give an appropriate gift, put money in an education fund, or whatever. \n\nPut the rest of your effort into getting your mother moved out, it's probably not worth a legal fight and the longer she stays in that home the longer she will be dealing with your SIL.", "Nta. Don\u2019t do it. Especially if the SIL has some of those bitter genes in your niece. Or use it as a bargaining chip to help keep your mother in her house (it it all in writing) than go out and buy her like a 98 Honda accord that runs but needs work", "nta.  Are they insane?  The MOST I would give for a sweat sixteen is 200.  If they told her you would buy her a car, that's their problem.", "NTA, and off topic why does your exSIL have any claim at all over your grandmas/moms property? Sorry might have read something wrong.", "NTA. Your brother and ex SIL have zero right to tell you what you should buy as a gift. Thats completely up to you and how much you wish to spend. Please don't take it out on the 16 year old who seemingly has nothing to do with the whole situation (and may very well be completely oblivious to whats going on with her grandma). If anything a 16 year old whos parents are going through a messy divorce needs your support not your money.\n\nI would say if she's been promised something and you aren't planning to deliver it then give her fair warning.", "> I refuse to hire a lawyer\n\nWhy?", "NTA. Why would it be expected that you would get her this huge gift?  Even if you had a closer relationship, it doesn't mean she's entitled to a damn car!", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe a gift at all, but it sounds like you're planning to give an appropriate gift for someone you're not close to anyway. That's perfectly fine. Unrealistic expectations from your brother or ex SIL should not be any concern to you.\n\nIf the exSIL complains, ignore her, she's not worth your attention.\n\nIf your niece complains, be sure to never make the mistake of giving her a gift again.", "NTA, how is the house issue not settled yet? A divorce will give ownership to someone. But they have absolutely no right to promise their kid a big gift from you. They don't control your money. Send the kid a card and write in there that unfortunately due to your mother's action in evicting your grandma, I have to use money allocated for your gift and buy her a house now. Tell your mom to do better. Have a great birthday!!", "NTA. Give a gift commensurate with the event, your relationship with the recipient, and your willingness to joyfully give. It sounds like all 3 of those measures only warrant a modest amount. 16 is old enough to understand that you don't expect a CAR from relatives you don't really know anymore. \n\nDon't give a gift based on the entitlement of a vindictive and hateful parent.", "Woah woah woah the person who is holding a house over your mother is telling her daughter your going to buy her a car? Are you just a giant ATM to these people? How did it get to this? NTA but man put your foot down.", "NTA your money you do as you want with it.", "Excuse me? Why would they have told her you\u2019d buy her a big gift?", "Gift her a small amount of money and when they question it remind them you\u2019re saving the money for your mom. You know because she\u2019s being evicted. \n\nCurious to know if they\u2019re evicting her mom too? If it\u2019s all community property they have to sell all the properties. NTA", "NTA\n\nHowever, is it at all possible to bid on the house through someone else or through a legal firm on your behalf?", "Why does the ex own your mother's house?", "Can you bride them? Say that you\u2019ll buy your niece a car only if they will sell you the house? That way, if the niece doesn\u2019t get a car they only have themselves to blame?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
