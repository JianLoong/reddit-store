On the property side you can set up a llc company and buy the property through that\u2026 but keep that to yourself and don\u2019t tell anyone!!!", "NTA Neither one had the right to tell the kid she was getting something expensive from you.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe her a big gift.", "NTA - we are evicting her mom and leaving her homeless but she will buy you a car! Dies that sound reasonable to anyone?!????", "Nta", "NTA but none of this is your niece\u2019s fault and it sounds like she is being raised by an unpleasant person. She might need your family when she\u2019s older and has more freedom\u2014so I might buy her a token gift just to keep the door open with her, but like a sweater or a comparable gift card, not a car.", "NTA. Your SIL has some nerve.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nHire. a. lawyer.", "NTA\n\nHer parents promised the big gift, not you. It sounds like a them problem.", "If you never promised to pay for the party or a car NTA. obviously her parents are the issue. even if you did promise it had the same value as our mums can stay in the houses", "I\u2019m so confused over the ownership of these houses. How is your ex sister in law evicting your mother? Does your brother then have the ability to evict her mother from her own home?\n\nEdit: if your brother also owns part of your mothers house, then how is the ex unilaterally able to decide on eviction? Why wasn\u2019t this property divided during the divorce? This is insane.", "NTA\n\nYou could create an LLC and make an offer on the house under the name of the company.  Have your realtor hide your identity and imply that you want the house as a rental income property.  Your ex- SIL will probably cackle at that.\n\nYou get the house then rent it to your Mom for $10/month or for free as makes sense.\n\nIn the meantime, let everyone in the family - including your mom - know that you're looking at other houses to see if there's something you could buy for her.   You can't risk anyone giving away the secret purchase plan to your ex- SIL.", "NTA.  They don\u2019t get to promise that someone else will buy her a large gift.  Wtf is up with your bro and exSIL?  I\u2019d cut contact with both of them.", "I am not hiring a lawyer because the house belongs to both my brother and his ex-wife, I would have to sue them both and I would lose. According to the law in my country  I would have less than 5% chance of winning this for my mom and I would have spent thousand and thousands of dollars that can go towards a brand new house for her. \n\nAnd yeah, I'm not bitter, I'm just massively disappointed and resentful that my brother allowed this to go on, and that my mom never listened to me and simply allowed me to get a different house.", "The law in my country doesn't really allow that. The other thing is she's not really selling it, she has made it clear that she is not selling to anyone but especially not to us. It's not about the money, she is just a very disturbed individual and my brother is a complete disaster of a human being. Hence the 10 year fight over these things. They are just people who thrive on this kind of drama. It's disturbing really.", "I think your answer is my favorite one.", "I wish it were that simple. The law in my country would require both my brother and my SIL to sign over the house but since they can't even talk to each other without an army of lawyers.... Other people have suggested that I hire a lawyer to represent my mom, I have hired a lawyer to explain to me what can be done and the answer is pretty much that I would spend thousands of dollars to buy time but my mom is going to be evicted anyway, the only one who can stop it is my brother. According to the law in our country he is the only one who can do it and threaten her to go after her own mother's house is she doesn't back up but I am not sure he's actually doing it.", "Yeah, it's complicated. My mom never and I do mean NEVER has allowed me to even mention moving to a different house. I have tried so many times for so many years to tempt her to live in a brand new house , shown her properties and it's always a no. Even now that she's being evicted she says no. \n\nI can't go to court for her because the law in my country is very clear about ownership, only my brother can fight this and I'm not sure he's going to. My mom has to move. But she is still saying she's not moving. I guess the cops will make her move? It's a sad situation, I still don't understand it myself", "No, my niece is the eldest niece/nephew in the family, the second one is 7 years old. I gifted my youngest brother a car when he was 20 (30 now) and now I am giving him a loan to help out with the down payment for his house but he's the only one who gets special treatment. One, because he's my favorite brother, and second, he's super sweet and a responsible adult who works hard and pays all his debts on time. My other two brothers I have loaned them money and they have never repaid. Very proud of my little brother for the person he has become and I will help him in any way that I can. But with my niece is not the same.", "NTA. Just flat out tell her and her parents that due to the fight her parents are having over grandma\u2019s house you won\u2019t be giving her a huge gift. \n\nThat should sting all three of them.", "NTA. I would remove myself from the entire equation", "NTA. Ex-SIL however, they are a raging AH.", "NTA I'd give the kid a gift detailing exactly why you can't afford a nicer gift for her", "NTA.  Your brother and his ex shouldn't have promised their daughter anything from you.  It's not their place to speak for you.  I would hire an attorney just to make sure your ex SIL plays by the rules.  Whether your mother likes it or not, she will undoubtedly be evicted.  If she is moving into a home that you are purchasing, that won't be a big deal.  If she's going to end up leasing a home or a senior citizen's apartment, it could be.  After all, landlords don't like to see evictions on a potential tenant's history.  \n\nI think you need to sit your mother down and make it very clear to her that there's nothing you can do to stop this.  My understanding of your post is that your ex SIL isn't necessarily planning to sell the house, she's just not going to allow your mother to keep living there.  If she is going to sell the house, you could use a straw buyer to purchase the home or set up a trust to purchase it (but a straw buyer might be quicker and time is of the essence here).", "I'll be your niece if you buy me a new car!!!!  \n\nYour niece is innocent in all this.  Buy her a nice gift but a car is ridiculous.\n \nAlso, if you have the resources please hire an attorney for your mom.  It adds value.  The attorney can walk your mom through the process of moving and help her understand the process and that she must move out.  An attorney is going to tell her the law doesn't care about emotions.   \n\nIt also shields your mom and you from having any contact with your SIL/Brother about this situation.  Once an attorney is involved, all communication with the adverse parties stop.  You don't contact them and they do not contact you.  Its less stress for everyone.", "NTA, but you're taking the situation out on the child who you admit is distanced from you at her mother's insistence, not her choice.", "Lmao. NTA. I swear half of these belong on r/firstworldproblems sweet 16 cars... Tell her your too busy saving your mother from the destruction caused by her mother.", "NTA buy her a gift you want to get no one should be promising g on your behalf what you\u2019re going to get.  They can buy her a car with the proceeds of the sold house and you can spend your money on a new home for your mom.  Best to not get involved in their toxic battle.  Good luck", "Eh, mom doesn't seem like she's deserving of that kind of disregard, she got sucked into the fight unwillingly.  It's perfectly reasonable for OP to want to help her.  I say OP tells niece that she can get a car if her mom drops the eviction.", "Fair enough but this is a huge ass family drama.\n\nWord of advice, your brother is never going to sue your ex SIL, the SIL will continue to be an ass and your mom is going to be stubborn about the eviction - I'd put a lot of distance between you and this because I get the sense from your post and comments that you're heavily invested in people who are far too stubborn.", "If it belongs to both of them wouldn't they need to agree to eviction? Are they kicking out both moms to liquidate assets? \n\nHow can this toxic SIL expect you to buy her kid a car while she's literally evicting your mom?  Hell no. Sounds like they've wasted enough money on divorce lawyers to buy a lot of cars."]}
