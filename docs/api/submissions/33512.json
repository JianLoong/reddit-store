However, Stacy recently made the decision to reconcile with \"Don\".  \n\n\n**The situation:** Stacy, Mandy, and I were all supposed to vacation together in our home state for the holidays. When we made our plans, Mandy and I told Stacy that Don would not be allowed at our rental due to safety concerns (hers and ours), and she agreed. \"Mandy\" and I paid for this rental together. Stacy could not contribute at the time we made the reservation, but it was not an issue for us to cover her.\n\nWhen Stacy reached out a few weeks ago to inform me she was getting back with Don, I told her that we would love to see her/have her at the house, but reminded her that Don could not stay at our rental per our prior discussion. I also said that I loved her but did not support her decision and could not do anything that would implicitly or explicitly enable her abusive relationship, which could result in her death.\n\nStacy decided to change her plans and not visit most of my family.

Don won\u2019t change by himself. If he\u2019s going to therapy and is active is trying to stop his abuse, I would try to support him without necessarily encouraging their getting back together.\n\nSome people from your family are really living in another world and should google \u2018domestic violence\u2019\nBut then, I also understand not wanting to alienate your sister because if she gets isolated, then she is in more danger.\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy choice and not something I would trust Reddit for.

But your Dad\u2019s behaviour beggars belief.", "NTA, *but*...\n\nDon't facilitate him isolating her from loved ones.", "NTA, it's not unreasonable to feel incredibly uncomfortable regarding this situation and not interacting with him. Him attending the holiday would look like you are okay with the situation, it would be near impossible to be near someone who abuses your sister.", "No one should be supportive an an abuser. But Stacy has to be ready to leave before it can happen. The most dangerous time for an abused person is when they try to leave. Stacy might be staying/returning to Don out of fear.\n\nIt becomes hard for friends and family to watch the ups and downs of an abusive relationship. It's important to find out from Stacy what she wants for the future. Does she want to leave him? Is he getting therapy? Is she afraid to leave? How does she want everyone to act towards Don. Her input is important because she is suffering from 1) the abuse 2) the isolation from her family 3) the embarrassment of being abused and at fault.", "NTA for reconfirming that abusive husband is not welcome. I'm not sure about the \"enabling\" comment, because it might just make her defensive.

Women returning to their abusive spouses, who promise them the world and 180 turn around, then continue the abuse, is something that happens very often. What are people supporting that woman supposed to do? It is very difficult. I guess there is nothing else than waiting till she wants to leave in earnest and then supporting her. But in the meantime there is no reason to support the \"Dons\" of this world or to pretend that you believe their bullshit. Some people would actually rather see their daughter being be*ten to a pulp than see her divorced. Explain it who can. I can't.", "NTA - how could you even consider that you are with all that you're doing for her. I commend you and your stance!", "NTA Don would have to show serious effort and improvement to be allowed back. It's sad your sister will put up with it. Make sure your sister knows you are there for her, and support her, just not the way her husband behaves. Don't cut her off, chances are she will try to leave again and it will be easier to do that if she knows her family is there for her. Good luck!", "NTA, but we need say you made her no good.\n Now her abusive husband know you don't like him and will see you  treat you as the enemy.\n\nIs a very common trait that the abuser isolate te victim from her support group. Any time you try to make her see the light or show you opinion against him he will gain force.\n\nHe will paint you and your sister as the bad guys, that you bought are against their happiness. With time he will isolate your sister.\n\nIn the long run, she will quit the idea of living because she will be alienated of her support group and will think she is alone a he is the only person he has to support her.\n\nMy advice: play the long game. You will swell your pride, you honor and moral and will ask for forgiveness.\n\nYou will ask his forgiveness too.\n\nBe her friend, make accomodations for his demands( this will also help to keep you in the loop of what is happening... You will have ground to se if things are going out of control) ... Every time he tries to make her cut you out be sure to show your sister that you are there and  you are flexible.\n\nDon't let him be her one confident... Be open for all the things he tell you... Be her best friend and let the plot part for when she isn't around.\n\n\n\nThe time will come where she will get out and she will do it with confidence because you were there with her.", "NTA", "NTA because you meant good and because you're allowed to be concerned about yours and sisters' safety. But consider that if Don is still an abuser - and he is, even if he's doing a path to get rid of his nature, it can't possibly work in a month - your behavior will give you a good reason to isolate your sister more. So if your goal is to not have her k*lled you better pretend to reconcile and to be docile with Don in order to not give him any reason. Also, I suggest you to talk with as many people as possible, both professional, former victims, victims' relatives, in order to collect info and hints", "NTA you paid for the rental and you get to decide who stays there. You do not have to share a home you do not feel comfortable with at this home", "NTA for the vacation part but by you telling your sister you won\u2019t support her it\u2019s pushing her further into his abuse and control.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
