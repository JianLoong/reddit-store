Provides security  of the roof over your head. Keep to your guns", "NTA. It's not just his money, he can't do as he pleases with it. Take back your own share.\n\nAnd be prepared not to see the lent money ever again. Buying two cars while you already owe money and then ask someone else to lend you money in order to pay the debt doesn't make sense.", "NTA - put half of your savings in your own account. \n\nServe him divorce papers and tell him you won\u2019t be with a man who wastes your savings without your permission. \n\nHe\u2019ll see sense", "NTA, loans to friends and family should be considered gifts. That's way too much to give a way.", "FYI never tell family about your savings and investments.", "Red flags everywhere.\n\nLending money because he bought cars for his other children?\n\nMaybe we need more information - did he buy a car for you?\n\nYou need more control over this account.\n\nGood luck", "NTA you'll never see that money again", "Couldn't agree more. Her husband just decided to take a third of the money they were saving toward a house to help his dad be irresponsible with money. OP had better start separating her assets and protecting them right away, because her husband is as stupid as his father.", "Absolutely the best choice. \n\nTake out your half. He can lend his dad 10k. And worry about getting it back. You keep yours intact and he can complain about how he's not paying him back, while you go ummhumm. (And thinking what did you expect you moron).", "My thought exactly!", "Did you want to buy them cars?\n\nBecause that is effectively what is happening.", "Transfer your share from the joint account since your husband can\u2019t be trusted to prioritize your family over his dad\u2019s debt.", "So why isn't he asking them for the money?\n\nIt's not selfless of FIL to buy cars for two of his children while expecting the 3rd to pay for it.", "It's not selfless if he cannot afford it. It is reckless and selfish as well to then ask you to cover it.", "Dads not paying this back.", "Not in 1000 years \ud83e\udd23"]}
