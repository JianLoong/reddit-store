He wasn't in the wrong for meeting someone and building a life with them and it sounds like he did his best at that point to involve you and be a good dad although it was clearly too late.\n\nI don't really see what your step mum did wrong tbh and I think as a grown woman now being spiteful enough not to send a quick message to say sorry about your mum is really harsh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He probably couldn't imagine having kids again at that moment and he didn't for 12 years.\n\nDon't move in so you can become a free baby sitter ..but accept this kid exists. It's not his fault.

Good for her in sitting boundaries.", ">Things changed when she accused me of saying rude things to her, which I did not\n\nThat's the part where I wouldn't want to have more than a calm but chilly relationship with the stepmother. I'd probably say my condolences next time I'd see her, but certainly wouldn't phone call if I want to keep my distance. It still feels odd since I'm in my late 30's, but between social media, emails, text messages on one side, and meeting in person on other, a phone call is such an odd mix of both that in current times it feels like the most intimate means of contact. Unless we're close, if it's not something that'd feel right being told via text, you're hearing it next time we meet in person.", "OP isn\u2019t trying to control anyone else and this isn\u2019t about her not having enough boundaries. I\u2019m not sure you have a good understanding of boundaries to be perfectly honest.\n\nOP has great boundaries. She was kind and welcoming to each of her dad\u2019s SOs. Even his current partner. His current partner tried to both cause a wedge between OP and her father, then assumed a closeness that did not exist trying to discipline her when only seeing her 4-6 days a week. OP\u2019s teachers see her more often.\n\nOP didn\u2019t fight or cause a scene, she just pulled back and tended her side of the street. \n\nThe gf had years to cultivate a different relationship with OP and didn\u2019t.\n\nAnother child wasn\u2019t something she was trying to control, she was shell-shocked as a teenager by the news. \n\nNTA\n\nBut death deeply affects loved ones.

I am glad you didn't move in with them\n\nYou didn't say a word to your stepmother because no one informed you, or told you of any funerals / memorial service,\n\nYou feel guilt because your grandmother raised you to have empathy and compassion.  Anyone suffering a loss should trigger some emotion.  it makes sense you have a myriad of emotions and are confused.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.  You have been living the life your grandmother would have wanted.\n\nYour father could have called and talked to you.  He didn't. \n\nCall your father, if you want to.

But maybe this isnt the place for this kind of talk? This is more about processing the divorce of your parents, i think there is still stuff lingering in you.

Specifically when they want to go on a couples vacation. Especially now that the other grandma has passed away. And if your dad hasn't relayed any of the family circumstances as regards his mother-in-law I wouldn't worry about having to express sorrow. They excluded you from being involved in that.\n\nAnd this may be hurtful to him but it maybe best to explain a different family dynamic to him.  YOUR relationship to him. He has  never been much of a dad to you. He's been more of an occasional uncle bring you for visits then sending you home to the parent who raised you \"grandma\". That you don't see his latest family as your immediate family, just extended family, and with the age gap your very much younger half brother as not a sibling but more of a cousin you will only see at family events.", "NTA\n\nClear cut on this one", "NTA", "op=NTA\n\nYour father is AH for making that promise in the first place.  Even if he meant it and tried to fulfil it. Nearly half of pregnancies(/births) are unintended.\n\nYou are not AH for wanting him to make that promise at three(? or later) because you were a child,  But you are OLD enough NOW to realize it wasn't a promise he should have made and you can deal with that reality rather than continuing to resent him for THAT(resent him for all the other legit. stuff). \n\nNot liking Father's wife is reasonable, It doesn't seem like you were a badly behaved step-child, just a resentful one(not exactly out of the norm).  \n\nSince you have pretty much stopped being in contact with them since Dad's wife's pregnancy--it is understandable that you haven't developed relationship with child or view him as family.\n\nThe sad part is it seems like he needs someone in his corner(who compares a 4 yr old to an 19 yr old?--esp. when she wasn't there to see OP as a 4 yr old!).
