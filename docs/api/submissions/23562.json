Instead, he left me with his parents. Even before they broke up, I always close to them and I love my grandma more than anyone in the world, so this is the best outcome I could ask for.\n\nMy dad moved to another town, he visited once a week, sometimes I also visit him on weekends.\n\nWhen my parents broke up, my dad promised he wouldn't have more children. He is, maybe just for me, famous for breaking every promises he gave.\n\nI've never had a problem with my dad having new girlfriends. I always try to be friendly with all of them. About 8 years ago, my dad met his girlfriend (42F), and we got along fine. Things changed when she accused me of saying rude things to her, which I did not, and she wanted to discipline me which she not having any right. My dad took my side, knowing that my grandma had raised me well enough. They had a fight and she said he spoiled me too much and I will become a brat.\n\nShe trying to act like she was my mom, making me do her chores, even though I didn't live with them. The young me didn\u2019t want to have problems with her so I obeyed. Silly me.\n\nThen, 5 years ago, my dad took me on a sudden trip, and I had no idea I was going until he picked me up from school with my luggage packed by my grandma. Felt like they kidnapped me. During this trip, he revealed that she was pregnant. I felt numb and didn\u2019t react much to the news. He broke his promise again, nothing new, but THIS is still too much. \n\nI distanced myself from them, blocking her from my social media and leaving the family group chat she was in.\n\nThey moved back to the same town after she gave birth to their son (4M). My dad bought a new house and tried to convince me to live with them. I refused because my home is with my grandmother, where I feel loved and safe. I visit a few times but never stay the night at their place.\n\nMy dad keeps insisting that I'm a big sister and that it's my role, but in my mind, I don't feel like anyone's sister. I know my half-brother is just a toddler and not responsible for this situation, but I can't stand my dad's idea of family. It makes me uncomfortable when he brings it up, and I avoid spending time with them altogether.\n\nI also hate it when my dad's girlfriend talks down to their son. She's already criticizing him for not liking to study or read. It's frustrating to see him being compared to me. True we have shared half of our genes but we are different person with different personalities and interests.\n\nI moved out for uni about a year now. My aunt visited last week and told me the girlfriend\u2019s mother, who I met a couple of times, had stroke and will not make it. Then, she passed. I didn\u2019t say a word.

He also doesn't sound like the most responsible parent when you were little but without context on why you went to your grandma and seem not to have contact with your mum its a bit difficult to judge. \n\nAs a child your feelings and behaviour are understandable although I think you should have been given more boundaries by the grownups in your life about how you can't control if your Dad has more kids etc. He's a consenting adult with capacity to make his own choices and now that you're an adult thats something you should understand. He wasn't in the wrong for meeting someone and building a life with them and it sounds like he did his best at that point to involve you and be a good dad although it was clearly too late.\n\nI don't really see what your step mum did wrong tbh and I think as a grown woman now being spiteful enough not to send a quick message to say sorry about your mum is really harsh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd probably say my condolences next time I'd see her, but certainly wouldn't phone call if I want to keep my distance. It still feels odd since I'm in my late 30's, but between social media, emails, text messages on one side, and meeting in person on other, a phone call is such an odd mix of both that in current times it feels like the most intimate means of contact.

I\u2019m not sure you have a good understanding of boundaries to be perfectly honest.\n\nOP has great boundaries. She was kind and welcoming to each of her dad\u2019s SOs. Even his current partner. His current partner tried to both cause a wedge between OP and her father, then assumed a closeness that did not exist trying to discipline her when only seeing her 4-6 days a week. OP\u2019s teachers see her more often.\n\nOP didn\u2019t fight or cause a scene, she just pulled back and tended her side of the street. \n\nThe gf had years to cultivate a different relationship with OP and didn\u2019t.\n\nAnother child wasn\u2019t something she was trying to control, she was shell-shocked as a teenager by the news. \n\nNTA\n\nBut death deeply affects loved ones. Acknowledge the death when you see the gf in person next. \n\nMy dad recently passed and my BIL and SIL didn\u2019t acknowledge it. I definitely noticed and we have a better relationship"]}
