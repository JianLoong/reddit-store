It's his life, not yours. You don't get a say is what he eats or when. His gf gets a slight say, she can order or make it for him, after all, and relationships are a partnership. If your brother is fine with the level of say his gf has here, that's up to him, not you. You're the sister, not the gf, and you're certainly not him. You can state your confusion, your worries, your opinion, but you can't impose those on him, now have a go at his gf for something they've probably discussed together. \n\nStep back and let your brother live his life. Maybe next time you see him, ask him about his diet and exercise regime so you know what it actually entails and what the doctor has said.

YWBTA if you say anything else.", "yta for butting in, they are not a child and you are not their guardian.\n\nBUT I think OP is correct, as he needs a lifestyle change, not a diet. being active rarely offsets the amount of calories people consume in a day if they are not reducing calories and a single cheat meal can cancel out a week of reduced calories. I remember a post somewhere else awhile back where a petite woman was panicking after a very rare cheat day where she ate several days worth of calories, as a fellow petite person that can literally change your size. Cheating should instead be small tastes of the good stuff so that the person doesn't end up binging, but it's supposed to be a bite of chocolate, a sliver of cake, a slice of nice cheese, not an enitre days worth of food in a single sitting.\n\nREGARDLESS butt out OP, not your child, leave your SIL alone, she likely cares more about her husband than you do since she plans on spending the rest of her life with him.

First of all, it\u2019s fine (within reason obv) to have a strict diet on weekdays while loosening up on weekends. It\u2019s even a thing among some fitness types, they call it a refeed day. Being in a constant caloric deficit is draining and can impact how well you can train. So there\u2019s some evidence that if you stay in a caloric deficit most of the time, but let yourself \u201crefeed\u201d and slip into a caloric neutral or surplus for one day a week or so, it can actually improve your training and by extension weight loss (assuming that\u2019s your goal). This is all definitely an oversimplification, but my point is that your brother\u2019s doctor is definitely more knowledgeable on his health than you are. \n\nSecond of all, how does having one calorie dense meal negate the impact of regular exercise? I\u2019ll give ya a hint: it doesn\u2019t. Again, this is an oversimplification, but the phrase \u201ccalories in / calories out\u201d is still a very useful idea - obviously if you wanna maximize weight loss potential, you should attack the problem from both sides by both increasing activity and decreasing caloric intake. But if you slip on one aspect, the other will still provide some benefit. \n\nAlso, most importantly - he didn\u2019t fucking ask. Unless your brother tells you \u201chey, I\u2019d love some help with my fitness/health journey\u201d, it ain\u2019t your place to provide any advice (especially since, again, you don\u2019t seem very knowledgeable on the subject anyway). Also I realize I\u2019ve been assuming this diet is about weight loss, but it could very well be about sodium intake, in which case who the hell cares how calorie dense his meals are? My point is that your brother is already working with a doctor - you throwing around snide comments isn\u2019t even remotely helpful", "YTA. Mind your own business. She's got him exercising regularly and mostly eating well. One meal is not going to change that. In fact it might be the only thing that keeps him going.", "YTA for alot of reasons. But his health and his choices are up to him (whilst I hate the whole excuse its \"too spicy\" because imo its just people being picky eaters, it is also something which is understandable). You trying to force every meal to be healthy can have massive drawbacks especially in the early stages of his diet. Basically diets only work if people can stick to them, and people will only stick to them if they dont feel forced or coerced into eating only a specific thing. It also depends on what his goals are and etc. There are plently of legitimate diets which include things like cheat days and etc for that reason. And they tend to be more effective (especially for people who do not like eating healthy) because it allows that freedom of choice every now and then. A single day is not going to ruin a weeks worth of effort (well not unless he had like an olive oil milkshake or something just truly horrifying). Though those diets do also have the problem of being able to slip back into old habits (but regular diets also have that same temptation, just with the added frustration). Plus it also depends on how his metabolism and etc are reacting to him being more physical and active and like a tonne of extra factors.", "MYOB!

We also, working off of what OP is working off of, can see that Op is making wild, swinging assumptions and calling people names over it, so it\u2019s weird you\u2019re rolling with that.\n\nHow is she hypocritical? Again, if he\u2019s actually shifted into running every morning there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s well over 300 deficit. I started by walking long distances since I couldn\u2019t handle running at my initial weight, but I walked 5 miles a day, which left me enough calories to have some serious meals if I had a light breakfast and a light lunch - that\u2019s how I enjoyed the holidays without any slowdown of loss.\n\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s exactly how it works for plenty of people who are losing weight.

One diet style is not good for everyone.", "Humans require a minimum amount of carbs to live. With 0 carbs, certain organs can\u2019t function. \n\nWhile high carb diets are genuinely unhealthy- depending on the person- my point was about the stereotype of pushing the excessively low carb diet trend that had caused so many people to lose weight in unhealthy ways by matching OPs judgmental nature with irony.", "Fucking word. \n\nI wonder where the OP bought all the god damn audacity. \ud83e\udd14", "I'm envisioning one spouse asking if the other wants to go for a walk and the other getting all excited like my dog does when I ask him. \ud83d\ude06", "Well yeah, since they're typing, and not talking.", "Ah, reading comprehension failed me.

The \"maintenance\" being sticking close to the kinds of calories you'd take in if you were trying to maintain your current weight rather than drop it.  Makes a sort of sense to me.  You ease up on the restrictions but in theory you're still not really gaining.  And even if it's just purely a mental thing, you feel like you're deviating from your strict and rigid regimen without even really undoing much of what you worked at.  \n\nMost diets I've tried ended because you get to a point where you say \"Man, fuck this shit!\"  And you go back to doing what you liked.  Case in point, I was shooting for 200 lbs the last time and when I hit 206 and didn't seem to be dropping much after...  There's often walls you seem to hit where you're stuck at a weight and can't seem to drop it, but if you stick with it eventually your body gives it up lol.  And I think at 206 I'd hit such a wall again and was all \"Fuck you, good enough!\"\n\nThis idea could in theory help me out with the attitude to keep plugging at it.

I\u2019m so over the food police. \n\nEven if it was in any way your business what works for one person doesn\u2019t necessary work for someone else.

You realize you can still eat a high calorie meal and excercise and it will still work? \n\nJesus you sound insufferable to be around.

Who pissed in your coco pops for you to be this rude to family over nothing? If you had any knowledge on dieting and eating healthy, you would know that your supposed to have the odd cheat meal. You are more likely to make your lifestyle change permanent that way.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re fathphobic. They\u2019re correct that it\u2019s none of your business what they eat or don\u2019t, when, and why or why not.

For all the reasons everyone else said.", "Wow you are overexhadurating so much.  \nEven if it was litteral poison in a bottle, it's not your business what he eats or does.

You do not know better than his doctor. \n\nLike I grasp that this society we live in somehow believes that everyone who isn\u2019t fat understands all the science behind fat and losing weight, but you don\u2019t.

Mind your own damn business", "YTA, simply because like he said, it's none of your business.

If your brother says he\u2019s got it handled and the doctor is cool with how he\u2019s addressing his weight/health, then the discussion should end there. Also - it\u2019s not hypocrisy to exercise and eat well most of the time and occasionally enjoy treats.

Unless you are a dietitian or a doctor, your opinion is worthless. Besides, your brother's quality of life should be a concern. A balanced diet means just that. Balanced.

It's a treat, not a staple.", "As someone who has had to go on a specific diet for health reasons, i can say the last thing you need is people judging you for having a day off or even making you justify what you eat.

Are you a doctor?

Is she pointing a gun at him at all times? If not, then she is not forcing him to do anything. He is an adult and is doing this by his own will. \n\n>and I mentioned the expensive treadmill they just bought for exercise, asking what's the point.\n\nWhat is the point of your comment?
