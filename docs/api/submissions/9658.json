I love my partner and I don't want to have these arguments all the time but I'm also hungry in the evening and just want to relax after working all day.\n\nI always thought I'm in the right but now I'm not so sure anymore. Because when I once demanded my partner to finish cooking despite our friends being already here, which caused them to witness us arguing, they seemed to feel very uncomfortable and had the same expression on their faces that I see on my aunt's and uncle's faces when my father commands and criticizes my mother in front of them. I don't want my behaviour to resemble my father's because I think my mother doesn't deserve to be treated like this by him.

Everything in this post is narcissistic and demanding. You literally say you want dinner to be cooked and everything to be cleaned. You're telling them their studying is worth less than work, and that they need to prioritize your wants first. You also state you keep yelling and getting angry at them, how about you communicate like proper adults.\n\nThe part that says you \"decided\" together, gives me the feeling you decided and they're so used to being bullied they agreed.\n\nADHD is NOT an excuse. I have severe adhd that went unmedicated for 25 years and found ways around housework and work. Set alarms, notifications, notes, etc. Theres so many beneficial and helpful apps for us now too. It is your responsibility to seek help for it, and to learn coping skills. It is NOT your partners responsibility to cope with you.\n\nIf you can't even control your emotions enough to reel them in, in front of others you are the problem.\n\nYou are already your father.\n\nEdit* A quick browse of your post history tells me you may be an abusive partner and not even realize it.

So in private, you're fine treating your SO like an AH, but when there's witnesses, suddenly you realize how ugly that behavior looks on you??  Obviously this 'arrangement' isn't working out for you or your partner, so why are you still pushing the same broken dynamic?? No one should be picking up after a fully grown adult, and ADHD does NOT stop you from clearing a table or taking out the trash. You need to stop being a burden and pull your own weight.

An exam? A deadline?

How you sold that idea to your partner I\u2019ll never know. \n\nYou can\u2019t \u201cbarely do housework\u201d and then shit on your partner for not doing enough.

It is just an excuse you are using. Do you have working hands, can you move? Then you can help your partner!!!!! You live there too. You say they are your **Partner**, but you treat them like a **Servant.**\n\n Second: School and studying, while it may not be as physically demanding as say a Ditch digging job, is very mentally and emotionally demanding.

Then when your partner gets home to see all these expectations not met feels so belittling even though she hasn\u2019t said a damn word, but it feels like depression x10.

Therefore, I want dinner to be cooked by my partner every day and the apartment to be tidy and cleaned at least on that one day before our friends come visiting. \nBut every fucking week when I come home from work on that day nothing has been done and often my partner is either not even at home yet or doesn't start cooking and cleaning until I get angry and rude and start yelling. I love my partner and I don't want to have these arguments all the time but I'm also hungry in the evening and just want to relax after working all day.\nI always thought I'm in the right but now I'm not so sure anymore. Because when I once demanded my partner to finish cooking despite our friends being already here, which caused them to witness us arguing, they seemed to feel very uncomfortable and had the same expression on their faces that I see on my aunt's and uncle's faces when my father commands and criticizes my mother in front of them. I don't want my behaviour to resemble my father's because I think my mother doesn't deserve to be treated like this by him. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You think yelling at someone is normal because that's what you grew up around, but it's not. What you're doing is abusive. It's incredibly unhealthy and damaging in marriages and familial relationships, and I'm betting it makes it even harder for your partner to pick up the slack for the both of you because you're acting like a major asshole all the time.\n\nEdit: And since you're whining in the comments about how you're just getting insulted and not receiving genuine advice, here's some actual advice: apologize to your partner. Tell them you behaved terribly, mistreated them, and that you're sorry. Hear them out and ask them how they feel. Tell them you want to make a new division of chores, who should do what, etc, and make an agreement that if things slip a bit you will NOT yell and resort to abuse but instead order takeout or look for other solutions. Promise to seek out another therapist, and find one that fits. In no way is your behavior okay, so instead of complaining about everyone being mean to you, you should try to change it.

I was a little surprised when I learned not all families are like that, but I was a lot surprised when I learned that not only are most not like that, but most people actually have an extremely negative view of yelling. I was honestly shocked. But when you learn that, the correct answer isn\u2019t to dig your heels in and yell more. Or \u201cbe better\u201d by yelling less. You need to learn that most humans find it intolerable. So you can take it to heart and realize what you think is true isn\u2019t true at all or you can isolate yourself even more. Btw, another thing I learned is that people who didn\u2019t grow up in environments like that dont see yelling in the same way we see it. What we see as yelling, they see as screaming. Never forget that. Your sense of \u201cwhat is yelling\u201d is probably not the same as other\u2019s is. \n\nSo, if you want advice, mine would be: learn from those other peoples facial expressions like you mention you did in your post.

I didn\u2019t realize what it looked it till I saw it. Nobody ever taught me that was bad behavior or how it was perceived by others. But once I figured it out, I never forgot.
