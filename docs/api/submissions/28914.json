{"id": 28914, "submission_id": "177lw2n", "title": "AITA for not showing sympathy for my bf when he got hit by a bike?", "selftext": "For several weeks now (maybe even months) every time we have something planned he squeezes something in with his friends or coworkers. Or he\u2019ll promise me something knowing he has already plans. So for example if we are going to do something at 4 pm he will plan something in at 3 pm and ofc will either be late or too tired to do what we planned. He never has the energy or wish to do something after work with me, not during the weekends either. He will go out with coworkers or go play some sport though, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s weekend or weekday. \nSo the few times that he suggest we do something I get really excited. \n\nHe wanted to play some game with me and we settled on one of my favorite games that he had never tried. He says that after work he has a quick workout and then when he\u2019s home we can eat a tasty dinner and play the game. I got really excited, made sure to not stay over at work and got home to fix up some stuff. He ends around 6, around 6.30 ish he writes to me a biker (regular bicycle)  ran into him at full speed. I start to worry and text him like what, is he okay and is he injured. He texts me back that it hurt and that the biker was stupid, but he thinks his head didn\u2019t get hurt or anything serious. He then proceeds to tell me his still going to go swim with this female coworker and that it\u2019s just them and that he\u2019s fine. I feel a bit weirded out and assume he\u2019s fine then. He goes swimming and around 8 he says they are done and he\u2019s heading home.  He comes home around 9 and starts cooking and Im just sad that our little date night once again didn\u2019t happen. He doesn\u2019t like being up past 10 during workdays and since it\u2019s a Wednesday I knew that it we wouldn\u2019t have time to eat, play and get ready for bed. \n\nHe later tells me that he\u2019s going to go play golf this weekend and just shows how he got scraped a bit and has a big bruise forming on his butt. I ask him if it hurts and if he maybe shouldn\u2019t get it checked out. He says no and that he\u2019s fine. He says that it\u2019s okay our night fell through because we can do it some other day. He suggests a couple of days and I explain how I have plans during those days. He just shrugs and says we can do it whenever. \n\nNow this is where I might have been an asshole. So I\u2019ve been somewhat quiet and focused on my job and school. Today he called me a narcissts for not showing any concern or sympathy for him getting injured. I tried to explain that previously when I worry and ask him too much about how he\u2019s doing when he\u2019s hurt or sick then he gets mad because I should just trust him on what he\u2019s says that he\u2019s fine. I defended myself and said that he was fine enough to go and do all these things and even said himself that he\u2019s fine. He claims that me being angry over our date night falling through instead of showing sympathy for him just shows that I\u2019m a narcissist and that I\u2019m insane. He told me to put this on Reddit since \u201cyou like reading AITA so much\u201d. \nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697276741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177lw2n/aita_for_not_showing_sympathy_for_my_bf_when_he/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You showed sympathy and he brushed you off.  Then went swimming with a female coworker instead of the planned date night with you?

He just tramples all over your plans to do something else.\n\nIt sounds like he doesn't like hanging out with you. Which is a bad sign for any relationship.  He also gets upset when you do ask him if he's OK and suggest getting it looked at?  That's normal for someone to ask.\n\nI dont want to presume about your whole relationship but this just doesn't sound worth it. He's accusing you and getting angry over nothing. Constantly breaking date night plans to hang out with other people.
