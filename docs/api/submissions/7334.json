Also calling your son \"my Jason\" is not very healthy.\n\nEdit: Ok, I did some thinking about this one, although I think you could have handled it a bit differently, this situation was not your fault, it is your son's.

Nevertheless your opinions about the subject are clear and I doubt You told her with good intentions.   \nyou\u2018ve driven a wedge between your son and his wife And I\u2019m not sure to what purpose except residual negative feelings about the way your son behaved when he was practically a child Himself Towards your grandson you\u2019re still grieving. You should be on his side. He didn\u2019t cause the accident and hes apparently trying to be a decent father now", "YTA\n\nYou said that you explained to her that this was technically your sons's second child.

Possibly even subconscious payback but it has caused trouble for him \n\nI suggest you apologise and put this right if you want a relationship with your son and grandchild going forward", "YTA.

If you felt this strongly, you should have had a conversation with YOUR SON first. Instead you threw a grenade into the relationship. Apologize before it is too late. If you thought it was so important, this could have been brought up before the wedding and she became pregnant.", "YTA you had no right to share that information. As soon as you realized she didnt know you should have told her to have a talk with her husband not tell every detail and show her the plants you have. Did you even bother to wonder or ask why he hadnt told her?? No. You decided to tell a pregnant woman a bunch of information that could upset and stress her which is something she didnt need. Now this woman wants to go see his disabled ex?? Why do you think you arent the asshole here? What part of telling someone else's information and pain is your place? Im not saying what he did was right im saying it was not your place to tell her any of this. You had years of them together and months before this to blab but you didnt. You waited until shes 7 months along to say \"its technically his second child\" which means YOU KNEW SHE DIDNT KNOW AND THATS WHY YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE!!!! Mind your business and stay out of their relationship.", "YTA. It wasn't your place to tell her about it. It's his burden he's carrying and it's up to him to tell her when he's ready. Well, it was anyway. I get that it's your burden you're carrying as well, but it's clear he wasn't comfortable telling her that just yet. People carry around those things for a long time sometimes without telling anyone and they have their reasons.", "YTA seemingly.\n\nIt wasn't your place to tell your SIL about her husband's dead child and past girlfriend. He definitely should've told her before you got the chance to bring it up, however, it wasn't your place to bring it up.

I would also assume he would have told her,  however you saying \"technically\" indicates that you knew she didn't know when you imparted that information, which is why you suck. It's part of your life story too so you have every right to talk about it, however she is pregnant and that seems like a very stressful revelation.  It would have been much more tactful to speak to Jason firat when you heard her talk about how this was his first child and warn him that it was part of your life story too. You had a grand baby, you lost a grand baby and you're not going to keep mum about it forever so he can pretend to be someone he's not. Give him a chance to tell her first. Jason is the biggest a h because not only did he not share this huge part of his life, his response indicates he never intended to tell her. He intended to proceed as if this were his first baby and keep his wife in the dark. While that is his choice, it makes him much less trustworthy in my book. I mean what else is he hiding from her if he can hide something so big under the \"its in the past\" umbrella? It's weird he thinks that it's only part of his life story, no one else's,  and that the child would never be brought up in front of his wife for the rest of his life.", "YTA and you sound like one of those moms who does everything she can to destroy any relationship \u2018MY Jason\u2019 has with any woman other than you. You\u2019re sick and need help. Of COURSE you don\u2019t think you were wrong. Your type never does.", "NTA you maybe didn\u2019t handle it in the best way, but it\u2019s not fair to ask you to pretend your grandson never existed. You\u2019re allowed to grieve. And I\u2019d be incredibly hurt and confused if I didn\u2019t know something like that about my husband.", "This is some really heavy stuff. NTA but I think you and your son need to have a heart to heart.", "Technically, NTA. She asked a question and you answered.  It would probably have been better to ask her to ask your son about it and have him let her in, that was his story to tell. If after that he refused to, then you should do as you did.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't aware. \n\nNow one more person remembers your poor little grandson.

I thought it wouldve came up.", ">>>showing that you knew your DILA didn\u2019t know\n\nIt doesn\u2019t show that at all.

That\u2019s a really normal way for parents to refer to their kids. I hear it all the time. Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing? But definitely common on the east coast and in SoCal, at least.", "I meant technically as even tho my grandson isn't here.", "I agree, if OP really thought she knew. Once op realized that she didn\u2019t know, she should have diverted her to the son. However, idk what that looks like. That cat was completely out of that bag, at that point. \n\nAs for why the son didn\u2019t tell his wife?  I\u2019m not defending, but I could see wanting a life where people didn\u2019t look at you with pity. That\u2019s one of those things, when people find out, things change in their minds/relationships.", ">It\u2019s not your information to be giving out.\n\nThe fact that this child existed isn't \"his information to give out.\"", "I meant technically as even though my grandson was no longer here.", ">Apologize before it is too late\n\nBS. She doesn't have to keep the entire existence of her grandchild a secret simply because her son doesn't tell his wife. He doesn't get to erase him from existence.", "Oh hell no, she shouldn\u2019t have to pretend her grandson didn\u2019t exist because he\u2019s too afraid to tell his wife the truth. Hes pretending and lying to his his wife that this child is his first. That child he had that he never bothered with existed and he mattered. Did Ops son really think that he could keep it a secret forever? 2 years, a marriage and a child on the way is long enough to have told her. Op is not a mind reader and was not to know that her son is that heartless he\u2019d lie to his wife and pretend his deceased child didn\u2019t exist.", "Also, why the additional commentary about her opinion on his 18 year old parenting skills nine years ago? That served nothing but to make her son look bad and, what, make the pregnant partner worry about his parenting skills?!\n\nNow the son has a good excuse to exclude his mom from his new family. He lost a child when he was barely more than a child, and he probably struggles with feelings of guilt over not being the greatest parent back then (which he honestly sounds like a very young parent leaning how to be one).", "Second", "I second this it's probably painfull for your son just thinking about it.", "So you think Jason was right for not telling her that he had another kid, whose life he played no role in? This is a HUGE red flag to me, and something that Amelia deserves to know. It would be natural for any sane person to assume that this was something Amelia had been told before they married. You don't hide things that big from your partner.", "Grandmas are great and obviously part of the child\u2019s life and all but the parent is the parent and the choice was his. I do think it\u2019s something he should\u2019ve disclosed, but still it\u2019s his information to share.", "His lost a child, while not being much more than a child himself. \nAt 18 I was going to be a father, it didn't happen. It wasn't until my 30s and my daughter being born that I was able to fully \"move on\" for lack of a better word. But even now I still wonder what couldve been. My son would be 21 this year. \n\nHe's probably still trying to come to terms on it, apologise to him for the mistake, but really you 2 need to sit down and have a proper talk about this.\n\nNeither of you are assholes, just people hurting", "> I assumed he told her.\n\nYou know what they say about assumptions?", "Ok, that's interesting, I didn't know it is common to talk like that there, I am from South Africa and it is not common here.\n\nI also made an edit to my opinion", "NTA But your son YTA.", "No she doesnt but it wasnt her place to bring it up. Once she realized her \"mistake\" she should have said speak to your husband. Period. Again I dont think hes right but honestly if he wasnt involved before he died are you shocked he doesn't being him up now?? Im not. Id expect that. Bc well look at his past but it doesnt mean it was her place to tell every single detail its her son's place to have that talk with HIS wife.", "Obviously, they need to talk, but it wasn\u2019t up to mom to drop the bomb on the pregnant girlfriend, give her all the gory details, and then give her a tour of the garden and memorial plants. That was MY Jason\u2019s job. It\u2019s not like he is a dead-beat dad with a forgotten son out there. And OP sounds like they knew she didn\u2019t know. Else, why the \u2018technically\u2019?", "You're legally required to disclose if you've ever been married before or have had any children before you get married in the US. So no. It's not up to him to decide.", "The differences in colloquialisms in places that speak the \u201csame\u201d language are so interesting!", "Based on the post he was a deadbeat dad while his son was alive, which is something I would definitely want to know if I was having a baby with someone. If Jason wasn't going to step up, someone else needed to.", "I\u2019m not from the US so I don\u2019t know how that works but is it legally required for the *grandma* to disclose this information? Or who\u2019s responsibility it is to disclose it? My point is that it\u2019s *his* information so it\u2019s *his* responsibility, not his mom\u2019s. Also, if it is legally required and they\u2019re married then I\u2019m assuming he denied having a kid?", "So OP \u2018says\u2019 he was a deadbeat dad 9 years ago when he was 18? Don\u2019t care. Not her place.\n\nEdit: and the more I think about it, why did her opinion of OP\u2019s parenting at 18 even come up in that \u2018discussion\u2019? Like what actual purpose did that serve other than to throw shade at her son? Make the pregnant fianc\u00e9/wife worry? Really shitty.", "It's a form of fraud not to disclose this information to your spouse before you get married. So he literally perjured himself when he filled out the paperwork and it's grounds for annulment, so I'm not sure why you're so hung up on the fact that grandma spilled the beans.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd frankly, while I can maybe understand those who said that your son should have been the one to tell her, which OF COURSE would have been the ideal, I'm appalled by those suggesting that it would have been up to him if he'd have chosen NEVER to share this information with her.\n\nFirst and foremost, you are not an AH. You clearly did not set out with any malicious intent or to break any confidences. You didn't know that the death of your first grandchild and what happened to his mother was meant to be a secret, and it sounds like it never occurred to you (understandably) that your son would have kept such a significant aspect of his life from his wife, his life partner and the mother of his soon-to-be-born child. While we caution against assumptions, this was not an unfair one to make, and you clearly had only well-meaning intentions when you mentioned this to her. She is your family now as well, and you were sharing another part of the family story . . . sharing the memory of one grandchild with the mother of what will be your next grandchild, and doing so with what seems like genuine love in your heart. \n\nAnd I'd say N-A-H, because Jason is entitled to struggle with such a painful part of his past, EXCEPT . . . he berated you not for being the one to tell her, but because he insisted that Amelia DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW because it \"happened 9 years ago\". I'm not sure if he's in denial or is coldly indifferent, but neither is healthy. And while it's true that he deserves some leeway to grieve in his own way, his wife and the mother of his child ABSOLUTELY HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW HE HANDLED THE ACCIDENT THAT CAUSED THE DEATH OF HIS LAST CHILD AND PERMANENT DISABILITY OF HIS MOTHER. After all, in a worst case scenario that could be how he handles an accident happening to her and her child someday . . . she deserves to know and understand that side of him. You are NTA for not letting him hide that from her.", "NTA- you hadn't realised that your daughter in law didn't already know and you have the right to talk about your grandson. \n\nYour DIL sounds a wonderful caring person, unfortunately your son is TA and probably was the same as a teenager.", "NTA\u2014your son is hiding aspects of his past from her. Whatever the reason for it, he and they need therapy about it. You can\u2019t just hide a whole other child (May he rest in peace) from your wife, and think that\u2019s legit. \n\nI know there are all kinds of people who have short relationships before marriage/commitment, who have perfectly healthy relationships, but my experience of this with friends and family has not been good. I just don\u2019t know that you can get to know an entire person, get to know their family/chosen family, figure out how you\u2019re going to fit into their life and them into yours, and whether you\u2019re compatible on all the really important issues, in just 2 years. I just always see things like this happening in quick marriages.", "Lady, YTA.\n\n1. How do you just get to \u201cthis is his second baby\u201d?  I suspect some verbal maneuvering.\n\n2. When you realized she didn\u2019t know, you should have said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is Jason\u2019s story to tell.\u201d  Then your son could have an opportunity to tell HIS story to her.\n\n3. You didn\u2019t call to warn him that you\u2019d dropped a fucking bomb into his life.  That\u2019s a pure AH move!  \n\nI\u2019m sure your son has plenty of regrets from that time.  I\u2019m sure he would do things differently.  I get that you disapprove of his actions then, how much time he spent with his son, how he treated the mother of his child, you intimate as much in your letter.  But\u2026 you took it upon yourself to tell your son\u2019s partner about his past - a painful and tragic piece of it - from your POV, not his.  And before he was ready to share it.   You are not the main character here, stop acting like it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your son turned out to be such a dick.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSounds more like he doesn't want anybody to know he was a shitty father. That doesn't deserve to be hidden.", "Your son ITA that's all I can say. Of course anyone would have assumed he would have talked to his new girlfriend about the son he lost.

I would be considering going scorched earth over this if I were her.", "NTA - You were reasonable to assume he would have shared such a big thing with his wife. I find it alarming that he hasn't told her this! So sorry for your loss as well.", "NTA - Every information regarding his child is good to know to any potential mother for his next children. I mean if my man had a child he didn't took care of and could easily forget, I would like to know before planning my own with him.", "NTA but also you had no right to bring up the past as well. It\u2019s your sons business, not yours. Some things are better off not said", "NTA- he doesn\u2019t get to force you to pretend that baby didn\u2019t exist.

I hope he seeks therapy to understand why he's so angry about it all. <waves hands>", "YTA. Gossipy stupid old woman!", "NTA. Since, you assumed that she already knew about your other grandson. I am sure he is still grieving. I doubt you ever get over the loss of a child. Plus, to have your girlfriend permanently disabled. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s got to be a crushing blow since he wasn\u2019t a great father at that time, probably due to him being a teenager himself. Maybe counseling would help your son. You don\u2019t have to answer if this is too nosy, but do you regularly visit Jenna? Does she have a support system?", "Yta- not your story. Not your place. You could and should have talked to your son about it.  I think you did talk to him and he wasn't telling her on your time schedule, so you outed him.\n\nIf i was your child i would put you in a communication time out so fast your jabber jaws would blow off", "YTA. This wasn't for you to disclose.", "NTA. Just an example of why people need to meet family members and old friends of partners.  You learn about their history. \n\nVery shocking your son never mentioned this.  Sad too.  There\u2019s no train why your so didn\u2019t tell his wife about this. Quite bizarre he had not shared his history", "\u201cWe were just talking about the baby, and I said technically this is Jason\u2019s 2nd child\u201d That\u2019s a weird statement to just say out of the blue, so OP\u2019s leaving out what caused her to offer that up. I\u2019m wondering if his wife said something about being the first baby, and OP felt \u201cinclined\u201d to share the juicy tidbit of gossip about his past.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle it would have been for OP to say nothing, then have a 1:1 conversation with Jason and encourage him to come clean.\n\nI also think it\u2019s weird that his wife wants to meet his exGF.

He\u2019s the AH here.", "NTA", "NTA. Spouses don\u2019t keep secrets, and this was a really big, really important one. But I wonder, why does Amelia want to meet Jenna? I can understand visiting the boy\u2019s grave, but I think pregnant Amelia meeting with Jenna would cause Jenna a lot of anguish. I assume due to Jenna\u2019s injuries she will never have more children, while Jason is having another baby, a baby he might actually be a decent father to. Please talk Amelia out of trying to meet Jenna. She knows about Jason\u2019s past. They can honor his late son, but please leave Jenna alone. She doesn\u2019t deserve the pain it will cause her to meet Amelia.", "NTA Did he really think this could be kept a secret forever?  I'm sure someone would have mentioned it eventually,  imagine if it was 10 years from now.\n\nMaybe you could have said she should talk to him but I have a feeling he would have been just as upset, maybe more because then he would have had to tell her or refuse.", "NTA\n\nOP assumed she knew. Who leaves this kind of stuff out of a conversation with someone they're married to? OP's son expects the whole family to stay silent? Painful situation, sure. Not getting why second wife wants to get all involved and dredge it all up, especially as her husband is obviously not okay with that. Seems like she's pushing a boundary there, but that isn't OP's fault either.", "NTA.  Perhaps Amelia is very empathetic and wants to help.  Perhaps she feels that Jenna, having been the mother of her fianc\u00e9s first child, could use the sense of being included in a larger family.   Perhaps her sympathies were tugged.  I would be trying to fit what happened to Jenna and the child into the emotional biography of a spouse.", "You were out of line. Easy answer. No reason he should have to see the ex again. Bad move on your part.", "First off, NTA, you are right she deserved to know. Anyone who hides their past from a significant other is basically lying of who they are. Sure you don\u2019t spill it all at once, but having a kid and all, something they should know about.\n\nYou had best of interest when the subject came up and most likely your response came out as a thoughtless correction to a statement along the lines of \u201cour first kid\u201d or something not realizing your son wasn\u2019t honest and open with her. I will say, your DIL is also pure heart and truly deserves someone better in the sense that they wouldn\u2019t hide and blow up when exposed.", "You ATA, I don\u2019t believe for a second that you did this without knowing that your son had not told her about his previously born child. You did this intentionally and maliciously.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH, but you handled that in the wrong way. Not malevolently, just made a mistake. You should have spoken to your son and found out his wishes. Maybe your son is grieving his son in a way you don\u2019t understand. But this situation can be salvaged I\u2019m sure and maybe something good will come of it.", "YTA - Why the fuck would you even bring shit like that up?  She said they are having a child, you say, that sounds great and leave it at that.\n\nEveryone who says NTA, they are wrong.  You fucked up.  You never assume someone else talked about something painful with someone without confirming it with them first.", "NTA. You clearly didn't spill the beans on purpose. That's definitely something his wife should have known by now. If I were her I'd be PISSED that he never told me and was trying to forget/bury an important part of his past", "YTA - the only reason you used the term \"technically\" is that you knew that she did not know. It's not your place to inject yourself into their marriage.", "This is a tough one because you have every right to talk about the death of your grandson. BUT, you can't tell us you didn't know that she didn't know. It would have come up already in conversation if he told her. It's very hard to believe you thought she knew when you've never once talked about it before, including the plants in the yard. The way you phrased it \"this is technically his second child\" seems like you knew she wasn't aware. Let's say you really didn't know, you should have said \"I'm so sorry, please talk to my son,  I feel horrible for letting that slip, I thought you knew.\" YTA.", "YTA. If you had to tell her that technically you thus is his second child at that moment you knew she didn\u2019t know. At that point you end the conversation. He was 18, I\u2019m not surprised he wasn\u2019t much of a father. The lack of communication in this family is astounding.", "YTA, his story to tell, just apologize. Saying she has the right to know is a ridiculous excuse. You made a completely understandable, minor, mistake, but are now doubling down.", "YTA.\n\nUnpopular opinion but that's when you make a joke like \"he adopted a fish\" after seeing the surprise because you don't know the reason he didn't share.", "I just think your son needs therapy", "NTA. Your son is. That is such a major thing to keep secret from your spouse.", "ESH. Your chosen language *heavily* implies that you already knew she didn't know.", "\ud83e\udd72\ud83d\udc4d", "Yes. I agree with this comment most. This wasn\u2019t a secret that was only Jason\u2019s to keep. His child was a whole-ass person, and deserves to be remembered, and that child\u2019s grandmother has every right to tell people about him.", "Goooood point.", "Seriously WTF. Leave the woman alone.", "Seems like that\u2019s what OP was going for\u2026.", "I would assume the Thomas the Train tattoo would have opened the conversation. If I were in bed with someone and saw that tat, I definitely would ask about it. Plus, he has a box of trains in his garage that belonged to his son. How did he/was he going to explain them?", "Doesn\u2019t matter what her reason was to tell, she still was the child\u2019s grandma and had the right to tell her.", "It\u2019s not just her son\u2019s past, it\u2019s her past. She lost a grandchild. She\u2019s not obligated to hide that just because her son wanted to hide something from his wife.", "Well that's the shit take of the weekend.", "Finally! Like they have been married for a year. If she knew it seems like this would have come up before. OP knew exactly what she was doing, \"I didn't know she didn't know (whine)\" Bullshit. She knew. She just thought new wife had the right to know. If that is true..... why tell her after she is already pregnant? Why not dating? Engaged? Married? What was the endgame?\n\nEdit vote YTA", "And if I was the mom, I\u2019d be ashamed to have a deadbeat and lying kid \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "He was a deadbeat prior to the kid dying though, so she has every right to call him out\u2026", "She\u2019s a part of that story\u2026", "It\u2019s her business too though. And if anything, it\u2019s more her business as she has a closer relationship to the kid", "Which she\u2019s a major part of and was a more involved person in the dead kids life\u2026 she has more of a say than a deadbeat bad", "Naw, that would be on him for lying", "No it isn\u2019t understandable. Since when do we, on this app, defend people getting someone knocked up and then running from their responsibilities? Like that\u2019s completely opposite of what 90% of this sub is against lol", "Jenna isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s disabled and is cared for in a home (sounds like a group home). And now he can never tell his wife about what happened from his perspective because it\u2019s forever tainted by his mother\u2019s obvious disapproval of his 18-year-old parenting/co-parenting skills.", "I think the existence of her deceased grandson is more than a \"juicy tidbit of gossip.\"", "A child (OP\u2019s first grandchild) that was killed in an accident at the age of two is not a \u201cjuicy tidbit of gossip\u201d - I\u2019m horrified you would characterize the death of a child that way. \n\nJason may wish to pretend that child had never been born, but he was and was obviously part of OP\u2019s life for the time he was alive as evidenced by OP maintaining plants in her garden.  \n\nJason needs to learn to be honest with his fianc\u00e9e and own up to his past.", "Yeah I don't really feel like relatives who have passed are \"juicy gossip\". This was going to come up one way or another.", "This comment sucks! Why is anyone upvoting it? The guy lied to his wife and he was crap father. It\u2019s not gossip it\u2019s important to know, especially bc that\u2019s not informed consent. Imagine marrying someone and them keeping this from you. What else are they lying about? I\u2019d want to know if my husband was a crap father and a callous partner in his past bc that would be major red flags. This is the type of guy that would leave his wife if she gets cancer", "I agree that\u2019s probably the way things unfolded.\n\nBut OP isn\u2019t treating this information like \u201cjuicy\u201d gossip, it\u2019s obviously a burden for her, and important enough that she felt compelled to share with DIL.\n\nOther than that I think you\u2019re absolutely correct.", "I assumed the \u201cmy Jason\u201d was because the baby was also named Jason", "This comment *was* pretty against the grain when it was made.

There is zero communication between any of them.", "That is fair. Still not her story", "My brother lost his first child when he was about 17. He was planning to take full single custody of him when Joseph was still born\n It's been 27 years and he *never* talks about Joseph bc it hurts too damn much. He didn't tell his wife until after my neice was born bc he was terrified he'd jinx something and lose her too. Every birthday he (and neice) visit the grave and lay flowers on it, he *also* has a commemorative tattoo, he kept the swaddling blanket from the hospital. He loves his son; he just can't have him a part of his daily life bc he can't cope with that.\nIf our mom did this, he would have reacted the same way. Hell, he'd probably go NC and this is a man who adores his family.", "I know Jenna isn't dead, I meant just the grandson's grave", "Yes.

YTA.", "My impression was that the use of \u201cjuicy gossip\u201d was meant to describe OP\u2019s attitude, not the actual tragedy. Just sayin.", "There's no contradiction there. OP mentioned it because she thought DIL knew. When it turned out DIL didn't know and asked for clarification, OP felt she had a right to know the truth and answered her questions.", "My bad! But for the record, I think what OP did was terrible. She didn\u2019t just \u2018tell\u2019 her. She went into graphic detail, including her opinion of her son back then.

Does she need to lie if Amelia asks what her plans are and she is going to visit her grandchild' grave? \nThis chaos was the result of her son's crappy behavior, not hers.", "It isn\u2019t her story to share PERIOD  plus I truly believe when mom spilled the beans she knew it was fresh information", "I didn't get that from OP at all. She has a place in her garden that serves as a memorial. That doesn't seem nonchalant or gossipy.

Even if Jason had matured and accepted he was a deadbeat dad to his first kid, it's still not something you can simply move on and forget. Amelia truthfully had a right to know, and from this story, whether it comes from Jason, Jenna, or OP, she can make up her own mind about her husband/the father of her child.

And she literally has memorial flowers for him.", "The story of her tragically losing her grandchild is absolutely hers to tell. I would agree with you if she was aware that her son hadn't told his wife because he is not ready to deal with it and she went and told his wife. IMO, in this situation, she didn't do anything wrong by not ignoring the fact that it seemed like her grandchild had never existed.", "I don\u2019t believe for a minute she didn\u2019t know. In almost two years, it never came up? When OP first found out about the pregnancy, it never came up? And she told her son\u2019s story with her as the center character. There are stories in this post from father who were in similar situations, and some of them have said they couldn\u2019t talk about it until after their first child was born because of how painful it was. The wife married the son for who he is now. This tragic part of his past shouldn\u2019t define him as a father, but OP seems bound and determined it does."]}
