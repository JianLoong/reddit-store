Nevertheless your opinions about the subject are clear and I doubt You told her with good intentions.   \nyou\u2018ve driven a wedge between your son and his wife And I\u2019m not sure to what purpose except residual negative feelings about the way your son behaved when he was practically a child Himself Towards your grandson you\u2019re still grieving. You should be on his side. He didn\u2019t cause the accident and hes apparently trying to be a decent father now", "YTA\n\nYou said that you explained to her that this was technically your sons's second child.

If you felt this strongly, you should have had a conversation with YOUR SON first. Instead you threw a grenade into the relationship. Apologize before it is too late. If you thought it was so important, this could have been brought up before the wedding and she became pregnant.", "YTA you had no right to share that information. As soon as you realized she didnt know you should have told her to have a talk with her husband not tell every detail and show her the plants you have. Did you even bother to wonder or ask why he hadnt told her?? No. You decided to tell a pregnant woman a bunch of information that could upset and stress her which is something she didnt need. Now this woman wants to go see his disabled ex?? Why do you think you arent the asshole here? What part of telling someone else's information and pain is your place? Im not saying what he did was right im saying it was not your place to tell her any of this. You had years of them together and months before this to blab but you didnt. You waited until shes 7 months along to say \"its technically his second child\" which means YOU KNEW SHE DIDNT KNOW AND THATS WHY YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE!!!! Mind your business and stay out of their relationship.", "YTA. It wasn't your place to tell her about it. It's his burden he's carrying and it's up to him to tell her when he's ready. Well, it was anyway. I get that it's your burden you're carrying as well, but it's clear he wasn't comfortable telling her that just yet. People carry around those things for a long time sometimes without telling anyone and they have their reasons.", "YTA seemingly.\n\nIt wasn't your place to tell your SIL about her husband's dead child and past girlfriend. He definitely should've told her before you got the chance to bring it up, however, it wasn't your place to bring it up.

I would also assume he would have told her,  however you saying \"technically\" indicates that you knew she didn't know when you imparted that information, which is why you suck. It's part of your life story too so you have every right to talk about it, however she is pregnant and that seems like a very stressful revelation.  It would have been much more tactful to speak to Jason firat when you heard her talk about how this was his first child and warn him that it was part of your life story too. You had a grand baby, you lost a grand baby and you're not going to keep mum about it forever so he can pretend to be someone he's not. Give him a chance to tell her first. Jason is the biggest a h because not only did he not share this huge part of his life, his response indicates he never intended to tell her. He intended to proceed as if this were his first baby and keep his wife in the dark. While that is his choice, it makes him much less trustworthy in my book. I mean what else is he hiding from her if he can hide something so big under the \"its in the past\" umbrella? It's weird he thinks that it's only part of his life story, no one else's,  and that the child would never be brought up in front of his wife for the rest of his life.", "YTA and you sound like one of those moms who does everything she can to destroy any relationship \u2018MY Jason\u2019 has with any woman other than you. You\u2019re sick and need help. Of COURSE you don\u2019t think you were wrong. Your type never does.", "NTA you maybe didn\u2019t handle it in the best way, but it\u2019s not fair to ask you to pretend your grandson never existed. You\u2019re allowed to grieve. And I\u2019d be incredibly hurt and confused if I didn\u2019t know something like that about my husband.", "This is some really heavy stuff. NTA but I think you and your son need to have a heart to heart.", "Technically, NTA. She asked a question and you answered.  It would probably have been better to ask her to ask your son about it and have him let her in, that was his story to tell.

That\u2019s a really normal way for parents to refer to their kids. I hear it all the time. Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing? But definitely common on the east coast and in SoCal, at least.", "I meant technically as even tho my grandson isn't here.", "I agree, if OP really thought she knew. Once op realized that she didn\u2019t know, she should have diverted her to the son. However, idk what that looks like. That cat was completely out of that bag, at that point. \n\nAs for why the son didn\u2019t tell his wife?  I\u2019m not defending, but I could see wanting a life where people didn\u2019t look at you with pity.

He doesn't get to erase him from existence.", "Oh hell no, she shouldn\u2019t have to pretend her grandson didn\u2019t exist because he\u2019s too afraid to tell his wife the truth. Hes pretending and lying to his his wife that this child is his first. That child he had that he never bothered with existed and he mattered. Did Ops son really think that he could keep it a secret forever? 2 years, a marriage and a child on the way is long enough to have told her. Op is not a mind reader and was not to know that her son is that heartless he\u2019d lie to his wife and pretend his deceased child didn\u2019t exist.", "Also, why the additional commentary about her opinion on his 18 year old parenting skills nine years ago? That served nothing but to make her son look bad and, what, make the pregnant partner worry about his parenting skills?!\n\nNow the son has a good excuse to exclude his mom from his new family. He lost a child when he was barely more than a child, and he probably struggles with feelings of guilt over not being the greatest parent back then (which he honestly sounds like a very young parent leaning how to be one).", "Second", "I second this it's probably painfull for your son just thinking about it.", "So you think Jason was right for not telling her that he had another kid, whose life he played no role in? This is a HUGE red flag to me, and something that Amelia deserves to know. It would be natural for any sane person to assume that this was something Amelia had been told before they married. You don't hide things that big from your partner.", "Grandmas are great and obviously part of the child\u2019s life and all but the parent is the parent and the choice was his. I do think it\u2019s something he should\u2019ve disclosed, but still it\u2019s his information to share.", "His lost a child, while not being much more than a child himself. \nAt 18 I was going to be a father, it didn't happen. It wasn't until my 30s and my daughter being born that I was able to fully \"move on\" for lack of a better word. But even now I still wonder what couldve been. My son would be 21 this year. \n\nHe's probably still trying to come to terms on it, apologise to him for the mistake, but really you 2 need to sit down and have a proper talk about this.\n\nNeither of you are assholes, just people hurting", "> I assumed he told her.\n\nYou know what they say about assumptions?", "Ok, that's interesting, I didn't know it is common to talk like that there, I am from South Africa and it is not common here.\n\nI also made an edit to my opinion", "NTA But your son YTA.", "No she doesnt but it wasnt her place to bring it up. Once she realized her \"mistake\" she should have said speak to your husband. Period. Again I dont think hes right but honestly if he wasnt involved before he died are you shocked he doesn't being him up now?? Im not. Id expect that. Bc well look at his past but it doesnt mean it was her place to tell every single detail its her son's place to have that talk with HIS wife.", "Obviously, they need to talk, but it wasn\u2019t up to mom to drop the bomb on the pregnant girlfriend, give her all the gory details, and then give her a tour of the garden and memorial plants. That was MY Jason\u2019s job. It\u2019s not like he is a dead-beat dad with a forgotten son out there. And OP sounds like they knew she didn\u2019t know. Else, why the \u2018technically\u2019?", "You're legally required to disclose if you've ever been married before or have had any children before you get married in the US. So no. It's not up to him to decide.", "The differences in colloquialisms in places that speak the \u201csame\u201d language are so interesting!", "Based on the post he was a deadbeat dad while his son was alive, which is something I would definitely want to know if I was having a baby with someone. If Jason wasn't going to step up, someone else needed to.", "I\u2019m not from the US so I don\u2019t know how that works but is it legally required for the *grandma* to disclose this information? Or who\u2019s responsibility it is to disclose it? My point is that it\u2019s *his* information so it\u2019s *his* responsibility, not his mom\u2019s. Also, if it is legally required and they\u2019re married then I\u2019m assuming he denied having a kid?", "So OP \u2018says\u2019 he was a deadbeat dad 9 years ago when he was 18? Don\u2019t care. Not her place.\n\nEdit: and the more I think about it, why did her opinion of OP\u2019s parenting at 18 even come up in that \u2018discussion\u2019? Like what actual purpose did that serve other than to throw shade at her son? Make the pregnant fianc\u00e9/wife worry? Really shitty.", "It's a form of fraud not to disclose this information to your spouse before you get married. So he literally perjured himself when he filled out the paperwork and it's grounds for annulment, so I'm not sure why you're so hung up on the fact that grandma spilled the beans.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd frankly, while I can maybe understand those who said that your son should have been the one to tell her, which OF COURSE would have been the ideal, I'm appalled by those suggesting that it would have been up to him if he'd have chosen NEVER to share this information with her.\n\nFirst and foremost, you are not an AH. You clearly did not set out with any malicious intent or to break any confidences. You didn't know that the death of your first grandchild and what happened to his mother was meant to be a secret, and it sounds like it never occurred to you (understandably) that your son would have kept such a significant aspect of his life from his wife, his life partner and the mother of his soon-to-be-born child. While we caution against assumptions, this was not an unfair one to make, and you clearly had only well-meaning intentions when you mentioned this to her. She is your family now as well, and you were sharing another part of the family story . . . sharing the memory of one grandchild with the mother of what will be your next grandchild, and doing so with what seems like genuine love in your heart. \n\nAnd I'd say N-A-H, because Jason is entitled to struggle with such a painful part of his past, EXCEPT . . . he berated you not for being the one to tell her, but because he insisted that Amelia DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW because it \"happened 9 years ago\". I'm not sure if he's in denial or is coldly indifferent, but neither is healthy. And while it's true that he deserves some leeway to grieve in his own way, his wife and the mother of his child ABSOLUTELY HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW HE HANDLED THE ACCIDENT THAT CAUSED THE DEATH OF HIS LAST CHILD AND PERMANENT DISABILITY OF HIS MOTHER. After all, in a worst case scenario that could be how he handles an accident happening to her and her child someday . . . she deserves to know and understand that side of him. You are NTA for not letting him hide that from her.", "NTA- you hadn't realised that your daughter in law didn't already know and you have the right to talk about your grandson. \n\nYour DIL sounds a wonderful caring person, unfortunately your son is TA and probably was the same as a teenager.", "NTA\u2014your son is hiding aspects of his past from her. Whatever the reason for it, he and they need therapy about it. You can\u2019t just hide a whole other child (May he rest in peace) from your wife, and think that\u2019s legit. \n\nI know there are all kinds of people who have short relationships before marriage/commitment, who have perfectly healthy relationships, but my experience of this with friends and family has not been good. I just don\u2019t know that you can get to know an entire person, get to know their family/chosen family, figure out how you\u2019re going to fit into their life and them into yours, and whether you\u2019re compatible on all the really important issues, in just 2 years. I just always see things like this happening in quick marriages.", "Lady, YTA.\n\n1. How do you just get to \u201cthis is his second baby\u201d?  I suspect some verbal maneuvering.\n\n2. When you realized she didn\u2019t know, you should have said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is Jason\u2019s story to tell.\u201d  Then your son could have an opportunity to tell HIS story to her.\n\n3. You didn\u2019t call to warn him that you\u2019d dropped a fucking bomb into his life.  That\u2019s a pure AH move!  \n\nI\u2019m sure your son has plenty of regrets from that time.  I\u2019m sure he would do things differently.  I get that you disapprove of his actions then, how much time he spent with his son, how he treated the mother of his child, you intimate as much in your letter.  But\u2026 you took it upon yourself to tell your son\u2019s partner about his past - a painful and tragic piece of it - from your POV, not his.  And before he was ready to share it.   You are not the main character here, stop acting like it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your son turned out to be such a dick.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSounds more like he doesn't want anybody to know he was a shitty father. That doesn't deserve to be hidden.", "Your son ITA that's all I can say. Of course anyone would have assumed he would have talked to his new girlfriend about the son he lost.

I find it alarming that he hasn't told her this! So sorry for your loss as well.", "NTA - Every information regarding his child is good to know to any potential mother for his next children. I mean if my man had a child he didn't took care of and could easily forget, I would like to know before planning my own with him.", "NTA but also you had no right to bring up the past as well.

I hope he seeks therapy to understand why he's so angry about it all. <waves hands>", "[removed]", "NTA. Since, you assumed that she already knew about your other grandson. I am sure he is still grieving. I doubt you ever get over the loss of a child. Plus, to have your girlfriend permanently disabled. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s got to be a crushing blow since he wasn\u2019t a great father at that time, probably due to him being a teenager himself. Maybe counseling would help your son. You don\u2019t have to answer if this is too nosy, but do you regularly visit Jenna? Does she have a support system?", "Yta- not your story. Not your place. You could and should have talked to your son about it.

I\u2019m wondering if his wife said something about being the first baby, and OP felt \u201cinclined\u201d to share the juicy tidbit of gossip about his past.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle it would have been for OP to say nothing, then have a 1:1 conversation with Jason and encourage him to come clean.\n\nI also think it\u2019s weird that his wife wants to meet his exGF.

But it sounds like those things were hugely traumatic for your son and he never got the help he needs to process and deal with them, so it's not exactly surprising that he didn't. Trauma sucks like that, and it's probably better that it comes out now rather than after the second child is born. Becoming a parent has a way of reopening those old wounds. I mean, I'm just kind of thinking of a scenario like your son suddenly crying or becoming very angry if the second child says \"I hate Thomas the tank engine.\" Without knowing your son's history of trauma, that reaction wouldn't make sense, but knowing what he went through, it would be understandable.

The way you are writting it it sounds like OP is hurt as if her first grabd child died yesterday. But the way OP wrote it is letting me know her son may have not necesserally processed it either. Sometimes AH is a strong term but I dont believe ESH either.

I could see it being a tough conversation to have for multiple reasons - although arguably should have happened before they were married - but even so if the son here was just trying to find the right time for the conversation and was putting it off, seems like a reasonable thing to give OP a heads up on to make sure his wife heard it from him. That clearly didn\u2019t happen and fair to say he wasn\u2019t planning on sharing at all.\n\nBut, I read it again and two details were nagging at me.

The more I write the more it is clear that the son is really an asshole. \n\nBut.. that resentment in those little statements seems pretty telling to me. OP didn\u2019t make an honest mistake. It isn\u2019t explicitly said, but OP didn\u2019t sound too sorry or embarrassed for over sharing, but took Amelia to the garden, and is clearly defensive now.
