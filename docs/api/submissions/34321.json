She barred her MIL from babysitting because of this, and I don't think she has allowed it despite it being several years ago now (infant now preschool).\n\nThere are plenty of ways to spend quality time that are not babysitting, and she can make use of those occasions. You get to pick who watches your child, so if it's no, it's no. Lack of judgement gets worse with age, so I would not have more confidence in her now that she's slightly older than before when she would have been theoretically sharper (not saying she's getting dementia or anything, just that mental abilities are known to decline with age).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My youngest has significant special needs as well, so as much as it would be amazing to have someone to help, they would not be safe.

It was a very difficult decision to make to cut off my dad from grandparenting, but I was in a good spot emotionally and mentally to make the move for the wellbeing of my child. It was still very difficult.  My dad cried like a baby when I spoke with him about our decision. My mom knew it was coming and said it was the right thing to do, but later lashed out at me in anger. She then joined my dad in counseling as we were NOT going to stand for that at that point.  My dad worked on his individual flaws that the condo incident highlighted and both parents worked on overcoming the Golden child/scapegoat dynamic they had created.
