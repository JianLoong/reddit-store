When we first got married, we moved to a different city for his job (in tech - he's a software engineer). In our new city, I quickly found an entry-level job in the field I thought I wanted to work in (publishing). However, I hated it - hated the office politics, long hours with relatively low pay, and found the work monotonous.

The pay is great too - 50% more than my current job (would be going to 75K from 50K) with better benefits (more vacation, more robust insurance with lower cost). The new job would also be strictly 40 hours a week (with occasional paid overtime) as opposed to my current publishing job which often requires 10+ hour days and doesn't pay overtime.\n\nWhen I discussed with my husband, he told me flat-out that although it's my career, he disagrees strongly with this move. He says that I'm going to get permanently stuck in the \"secretarial pool\" and that it's not really a professional job that's appropriate for our life plan, and that he's going to be embarrassed by me and will think less of me.

There is also definitely a path forward as the CEO said that those who do well in the assistant role for a year or two will have opportunities for promotion to account coordination/management roles.)\n\nI told him I was sorry to disappoint him, but I'm really miserable in my current job and need to make a change and this is the best offer I have.

Are you kidding - good executive assistants CLEAN UP! It's a great dynamic job!", "NTA. I went the \"secretarial\" path, when I really wanted to go into accounting and be a CPA. I was on that path for 16 years, and most of the time I really loved it. But eventually I wanted something more - I was a directors \"secretary\" and there was nothing more where I was. The title was secretary, but really it was more of an executive assistant, and they finally changed the title after I left. My ex didn't want me to change career paths, didn't support me in getting a degree, and wanted me to stay for \"job security\". It drove me crazy, and I really hated it eventually. I could do my work in half the day. If I'd stayed I'd still be doing the same thing, had less money and benefits and been stressed over layoffs several times. I might eventually have made more than I was making at the time, and I couldn't have already retired, but one thing I've learned about myself is I'm not someone to stay stagnant in a job and be happy. I want to do and learn more all the time. \n\nAfter our divorce, I chose to go side-ways into a different career (not accounting). I paid attention in my last secretarial job so I learned a lot that was not secretarial related at all but related to the new career. I loved my job, loved my boss, went back to school and finished my BA, started my MPA. I only left because my boss's boss was a micro-manager which I couldn't deal with because I was competent at my job and didn't need someone looking over my shoulder all the time. So I left for another employer and finished my education. I've been there over 10 years, and still enjoy my job.\n\nIt's important to discuss career and job changes with your spouse because they impact your family. BUT you also need to enjoy your job, have a path upward if you want it, and a way to increase your pay and benefits rather than remaining stagnant. Hating your job, working long hours for low pay, and not having any upward mobility are not a fun way to spend your career. It wears on you. And if your spouse isn't supportive of you having a fulfilling career, even if it means you change careers, that even makes it worse. \n\nBeing an executive assistant is neither inappropriate nor embarrassing.

EAs are often the most knowledgable people in organisations, they are exposed to so much of what's happening, how things work, strategy etc. I had a similar response from a co-worker when I took a stint as EA to a 2IC - \"pigeonholed\" was the term she used. That role allowed me to be across key projects, WORK ON key projects, move to project specific roles and I am now a subject matter expert. Because I was \"Just an EA\".

It was for a lot less pay, but she knew she\u2019d have to prove herself after so long in a different field, and with little computer knowledge.\n\nMy dad was so mad. He wanted my mom to stay home. Mind you, we kids were out of the house by then\u2026 He was actually threatening to divorce her!! (Whole nother story lol)\n\nWell, Mom took the job anyway. Dad stayed, but he was an ass about her job/pay. A few months into the new job and Dad\u2019s Rottweiler died. He loved that dog like he loved us kids. He wanted another dog. Mom said no. They fought some more.\n\nUltimately an agreement was made that if Dad never said another word about Mom\u2019s job, she would acquiesce his K9 request.

His comment about thinking less of you might tie into seeing you give up on your \"dream job\" because he cannot imagine someone's dreams might change with time and experience. He also might have set up a life plan progression in his head and has unhealthily clung to it for security and is floundering now that this concept is no longer true. I know that I have days when even the smallest unexpected change in plans can set my brain down into an adult version of a meltdown. It makes no sense and I know it, but I cannot control it in the moment and have to actively work to not take things personally just because my brain is wired differently.  It's not easy, but can be done with the right supports for autistic individuals. My best advice for helping him if this might be an issue for him is to make a list of people who have started off in executive or administrative assistant positions and where their careers ended up. A nice, logical list of success stories unencumbered by anything emotional followed up with a discussion of a new life and career plan for him to find comfort in. He can always say, \"My wife is the right-hand woman to the CEO of...\" if he wants a sentence that sounds prideful to him.\n\nPersonally, while I'm currently a SAHM, I have two degrees in IT and over a dozen certifications but, if given the opportunity to return to the workforce, I would 100% seek employment as an administrative assistant again. I loved the job and all of the connections I had back in those days. I never would have known this about myself if I hadn't stumbled into that first job as one because all I had to go on for a \"secretary's\" job was what I saw from Hollywood or read in books.\n\nNot saying your husband isn't just a misogynist who only values you for what level of pride your job title gives him- he very well could be- I just wanted to give an alternative perspective. Either way, he needs to speak to someone about his issues so you both can decide if your relationship can work given what you've learned about each other in a time of what one would arguably say is positive stress.\n\nTake the job. Learn everything you can and make decisions on where your career is headed based on what you learn about yourself along the way. This sounds like an amazing opportunity and the start of a very happy and successful future for you.\n\nAlso, consider telling him to actually look into the publishing industry right now and where it's headed in the next 10-15 years. If this were the early 2000s, you would be the person getting out of the tech industry shortly before the bust and moving into a better paying job with better benefits and hours to boot! You'll will wind up better for this either way simply from the connections you will make in this new job. I'm so proud of you and I don't even know you, lol!  \n\n\nEDIT: NTA, obviously.", "My friend started as exec assistant is now the director of marketing.

Given that I haven't seen any previous signs of him being controlling or abusive, I think he was attached the prestige of having a wife in publishing, especially thinking of me as a future book editor, a very high-prestige job (where pay is really disproportionately low as compared to the prestige). \n\nI think I will have to talk to him about whether he will be able to let go of this disappointment and focus on the better future we can have if I'm doing work I love that gives me work-life balance and a much better chance of a good career progression. If not, there isn't much hope for us, but if he's just reacting badly in the short-term because he's letting go of a particular vision of our life that he was attached to, then I can work with that. Assuming it doesn't take too long for him to come around.", "Thank you for this really compassionate and practical advice. I do think there is some chance my husband might be on the spectrum - he hasn't been diagnosed but definitely exhibits some of the traits (such as being fixated on a particular goal, having rigid ideas that he isn't open to revisiting, etc.) \n\nI love the idea of working with him on a list of folks who started in admin/EA roles and went on to extremely successful high-powered careers, as well as exploring the problems with the publishing industry to show that it's a good time to adapt my prior dream into a new one that has more of a future.\n\nAnd, I really appreciate the encouragement!", "I am especially assuming that my new boss, a married straight woman in her 50s, is not going to try to sleep with me, a married straight woman in her 20s.\n\nI'm actually a lot more likely to get harassed/propositioned in my soon-to-be-former publishing job, where there is actually a lot of misogyny.", "Thanks!

He doesn't want to be married to you - he said that. He's either a controlling fuckwit who didn't mean it, or he is an ignorant fuckwit who did mean it. Given he's giving you the silent treatment, I'd say he's a controlling fuckwit.\n\nEither way, the outlook for staying with him is not ideal. Storms ahead.", "Oh, that's definitely not true. Secretaries still exist; administrative assistants are definitely secretaries, and one could convincingly argue that executive assistants are also secretaries. So are legal secretaries (and arguably, paralegals),; medical assistants, secretaries, and scribes; aide-de-camps; personal assistants and \"body people,\" and many other roles.\n\nThe problem here is not the terminology, really; it's the weird disdain from secretaries that I think spawns from stereotypical portrayals of secretaries in media. They're almost always women and usually sexualized in some way: the boss divorced his wife and ran off with the secretary; the intrepid and hopeful young secretary is degraded and harassed by her boss, *Mad Men*, etc.\n\nA 'secretary,' though, is just someone who provides administrative and organizational support, typically in an office setting: record-keeping, planning and arranging events or travel for executives, organizing the executive's calendar, answering calls and emails, taking meeting minutes, preparing documents for review during executive meetings, procuring equipment or services for the organization, - you know, clerical tasks.\n\nBut those tasks are both *incredibly* important and require a breadth of high-level organizational, interpersonal, and communication skills! You have to know your executive really well and be able to write clearly, persuasively, and in their voice. You have to know which meetings they would prioritize and which ones they would cancel or change (which necessarily means that you understand the business they are conducting, what's top of mind for them, where the priorities are, and what they should be focusing on). If you're prepping documents for them, that takes research skills. Sometimes EAs and admins run projects, which requires project management skills.\n\nYou have to be able to interface with your executive's contacts and guests from all over the company and sometimes the country or world...and you cultivate them as contacts as well. You have to deeply understand the sometimes byzantine corporate systems and policies so you can help secure resources for your organization. (I had to do a purchase order like once at my job and it took me a month, and an hour-long training video.) Event planning is like a whole other skill set, especially if it's conferences or executive meetings.\n\nI mean, the idea that people think this is \"just\" anything is...well. Again, I think it's because it was traditionally women's work, so people devalued it.", "Is that how he thinks of you? As someone who is lazy and makes excuses to not have to work hard?

I'm not \"giving up\" anything other than a thankless, relatively low-paying entry-level job, but I'm just trading it in for a better one with an organization that resonates with me much more.", "Thank you for providing this framework. He has been providing 75% of the financial support to my 25%, the new ratio would be 66.6% to 33.3%, but emotionally I am definitely putting in way more than him. I will think about our other goals and objectives as well and what he brings to the table other than his salary - I think it will be pretty eye-opening.", "There were actually more publishing job opportunities anyway in the new city, but yes, I did follow him and figured I would live and work in the city where he was working. The new job doesn't even require any actual sacrifices on his part - as I said, if anything I will have more free time because the hours aren't as long, and I will get paid more.", "My new boss is a married straight woman (which my husband knows)! So I don't think it's about romantic jealousy.", "The fucked up thing is that when I read the title, I was fully expecting OP to say that they took a job as a stripper or drug dealer.... But nope..... Executive Assistant making $75k a year..... Most (secure) men would do almost anything to have a wife like OP who's just trying to be happy and successful.", "Oh he'd love her become a SAHM - then HE would be the macho breadwinner and she just the little woman he has to support/s", "One of my closest friend was a legal assistant and absolutely hated it.  She took a job in the service field and everyone thought she was taking a step down even though she made more money with the new job and had more consistent hours.  She is much  happier because she is not dealing with the stress of the other job, so in essence, titles mean nothing, peace of mind is everything.", "NTA - but please go and tell your husband that you applied for a job as a stripper at whatever club or bar is not far from you and ask him if he is satisfied now.", "WTAF\n\nHow did the rest of that conversation go?", "I hope it helps! If he is on the spectrum, giving him bland, easily verified facts to work with instead of emotional pleas might be the answer to breaking through this meltdown he's experiencing. If you can find people in fields that he has a side interest in that have succeeded from admin/EA roles, it would sink in even quicker because it would be attached to something he already has a positive association with. Once he's worked through the panic/freeze/meltdown stage, he'll be able to discuss the future clearer. Right now his entire mental safety net might be in chaos and that's why he's suddenly acting so differently than you've ever seen.\n\nIf it helps him, getting my autism diagnoses as an adult was one of the best things I've had happen and has taught me so much about myself and the rest of the world. Helped me work through a lot of negative emotions from my youth as well.\n\nAlso, have him ask ANYONE who knows anything about business environments about the roles of the admin staff. Admins RUN THE PLACE! Period. End of story. And anyone who doesn't quickly learn that... well, sucks to be them.", "Thanks! I really thought you said the CEO was a man, but apparently I'm more sleep deprived than I thought.", "Is it possible he has a relationship or past relationship with your new boss? Not necessarily romantic or sexual.", "He\u2019s so threatened\u2014 she impressed a CEO and would be making a considerable amount more than she currently does. \n\nHe sounds like he wants her to be in a position to need him; of course he\u2019d be embarrassed when she clearly doesn\u2019t. The man is freaking out and he should be dumped", "I had the same thought. He is being VERY dismissive of this job that pays 50% more for working less hours.  That sounds like a guy who WANTS his wife to be working longer. That\u2019s very suspect.", "exec assistants in tech definitely make a pretty good salary. the last startup i was at was paying their exec assistants $120k+. at google they call them \"administrative business partners\". it's often a good stepping stone to other roles, often going to chief of staff.", "THIS. Being an assistant to an important person is *not* as easy as some might think. While $300k is lofty, $120k is commonplace. OP\u2019s husband isn\u2019t just an asshole; he\u2019s wrong.", "executive assistants have a ton of power. one of the important things i learned in law school is how important it is to be courteous and kind (and appreciative) to EVERYONE's secretary/EA/clerk. they can absolutely make it easier or harder to talk to the c suite/judge/partner. \n\nwhen we interview for new associate's, they way they treat assistants and support staff is absolutely something that can enhance or destroy a candidate's chances. \n\nHusband may be hurting himself at work if he takes a dismissive attitude towards EAs. wonder if he's shitty to his boss's secretary?", "Thank you again. I will check around for some folks he can talk to who are more aware of what happens in most current business environments (outside the tech bubble which has its own culture), who can share info about the responsibilities of admin/EA jobs these days.\n\nAnd thank you for pointing out that he may just be in panic mode because of an unexpected change. If that's the case I am certainly willing to work through it with him if he will be open to getting some help with his thought patterns.", "That would be...extremely odd? Given that my new boss is a married woman in her 50s, in a completely different industry from him, and we're in our 20s and just moved to this city a couple years ago. I can't, for the life of me, think of how they would have crossed paths in any sense.", "I wonder if his perspective would change if he was in a position with his own EA", "Pepper Pots started out as an assistant (Iron Man movies) and now she runs the company.\n\nAlso, yes, they can make way more than 100K per year especially if you get stock options.", "Take the job!! This way you wont need a husband with all that money if he decides to think less of you. Dont let him intimidate you into letting this go.", "If you don't mind me chiming in once again, I've got a suggestion assuming that u/MindOverMuses is on the right track, which sounds likely.\n\nDH is likely to respond to a good logical and structural argument that rests on roles and responsibilities. The maxim, taken from the military and used in organizational management, is that responsibility and control need to be evenly matched, else you end up with a disaster.\n\nYou see it all the time when people are held responsible for things that they couldn't change, or if people are not held accountable for the things that they did or didn't do. \n\nYou are married, so you work as a partnership. That means that you have to develop an operational API, by which I mean a protocol to make sure you are both aligned.\n\nThe protocol will include the things that affect you as a couple: for example, how jobs affect the city you live and work in.\n\nTLDR: He is responsible for his career. You are responsible for yours. Each of you has control over your own career, not the other person's - and that's derived from a solid, practical and well-tested approach.", "Yeah but even so her pay jumped considerably. It may not be at the level where he is but it\u2019s at a level that would put her at a much more comfortable, secure place finically.", "Concerned about her spending time around a successful woman and might realize she doesn't need anyone else at all or can have her pick of better partners.", "Thanks! This is a really good suggestion and I hope he will be open to this practical approach.", "My spouse would be thrilled even if there were no payraise. Just because the old job sucks and my spouse would want me to find something better fitting.", "I manage the office at the company I work for, and the guys know better than to piss me off. I\u2019m the keeper of the snacks. \ud83d\ude02", "I divorced a man like that. No matter what I did, he wasn't happy. If I wasn't how he pictured me, he'd complain. Dumped him and found me someone who loves and values me. Before all that, you got to value yourself.", "Hey good job being a grown up, sorry you're not married to one lol. But seriously what grown man gives someone the silent treatment it's so petty.", "Yeah but you actually like your wife and likely see her as a partner rather than an accessory.\n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s up to something shady- I think the pay raise will bring her close to his level (or he\u2019ll maybe even past him) and he can\u2019t stand the idea of them being equals finically.\n\nHe sounds insecure, manipulative and exhausting.\n\nHopefully op will realize she deserves better and use some of the money from the new job to facilitate a divorce.", "Which is crazy... In an earlier life, I went to school to be an admin assistant.. One of my professors had been an executive assistant in the college system of my state, she got paid big bucks and kept her office running smoothly, she was indespensible to the organization, and was what we all aspired to be. It's not a small job, there's so much that goes into it.", "From porn probably"]}
