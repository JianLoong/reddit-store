When we first got married, we moved to a different city for his job (in tech - he's a software engineer). In our new city, I quickly found an entry-level job in the field I thought I wanted to work in (publishing). However, I hated it - hated the office politics, long hours with relatively low pay, and found the work monotonous.

The job seemed to be a great fit at every step - I really clicked with the executive I would be supporting, and liked everything about the company (which is stable and growing with no sign of layoffs like a lot of companies are going through right now). The pay is great too - 50% more than my current job (would be going to 75K from 50K) with better benefits (more vacation, more robust insurance with lower cost). The new job would also be strictly 40 hours a week (with occasional paid overtime) as opposed to my current publishing job which often requires 10+ hour days and doesn't pay overtime.\n\nWhen I discussed with my husband, he told me flat-out that although it's my career, he disagrees strongly with this move. He says that I'm going to get permanently stuck in the \"secretarial pool\" and that it's not really a professional job that's appropriate for our life plan, and that he's going to be embarrassed by me and will think less of me. (The job is to serve as the assistant to the CEO/owner of a marketing/advertising agency, which is also a field I am very interested in learning more about - I mean I suppose you could debate the ethics of marketing/advertising, but it's not like it's doing something illegal or for a company/exec with a horrible reputation. There is also definitely a path forward as the CEO said that those who do well in the assistant role for a year or two will have opportunities for promotion to account coordination/management roles.)\n\nI told him I was sorry to disappoint him, but I'm really miserable in my current job and need to make a change and this is the best offer I have.

Are you kidding - good executive assistants CLEAN UP! It's a great dynamic job!", "NTA. I went the \"secretarial\" path, when I really wanted to go into accounting and be a CPA. I was on that path for 16 years, and most of the time I really loved it. But eventually I wanted something more - I was a directors \"secretary\" and there was nothing more where I was. The title was secretary, but really it was more of an executive assistant, and they finally changed the title after I left. My ex didn't want me to change career paths, didn't support me in getting a degree, and wanted me to stay for \"job security\". It drove me crazy, and I really hated it eventually. I could do my work in half the day. If I'd stayed I'd still be doing the same thing, had less money and benefits and been stressed over layoffs several times. I might eventually have made more than I was making at the time, and I couldn't have already retired, but one thing I've learned about myself is I'm not someone to stay stagnant in a job and be happy. I want to do and learn more all the time. \n\nAfter our divorce, I chose to go side-ways into a different career (not accounting). I paid attention in my last secretarial job so I learned a lot that was not secretarial related at all but related to the new career. I loved my job, loved my boss, went back to school and finished my BA, started my MPA. I only left because my boss's boss was a micro-manager which I couldn't deal with because I was competent at my job and didn't need someone looking over my shoulder all the time. So I left for another employer and finished my education. I've been there over 10 years, and still enjoy my job.\n\nIt's important to discuss career and job changes with your spouse because they impact your family. BUT you also need to enjoy your job, have a path upward if you want it, and a way to increase your pay and benefits rather than remaining stagnant. Hating your job, working long hours for low pay, and not having any upward mobility are not a fun way to spend your career. It wears on you. And if your spouse isn't supportive of you having a fulfilling career, even if it means you change careers, that even makes it worse. \n\nBeing an executive assistant is neither inappropriate nor embarrassing.
