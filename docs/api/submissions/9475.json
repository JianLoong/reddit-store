When we first got married, we moved to a different city for his job (in tech - he's a software engineer). In our new city, I quickly found an entry-level job in the field I thought I wanted to work in (publishing). However, I hated it - hated the office politics, long hours with relatively low pay, and found the work monotonous.

The pay is great too - 50% more than my current job (would be going to 75K from 50K) with better benefits (more vacation, more robust insurance with lower cost). The new job would also be strictly 40 hours a week (with occasional paid overtime) as opposed to my current publishing job which often requires 10+ hour days and doesn't pay overtime.\n\nWhen I discussed with my husband, he told me flat-out that although it's my career, he disagrees strongly with this move.

There is also definitely a path forward as the CEO said that those who do well in the assistant role for a year or two will have opportunities for promotion to account coordination/management roles.)\n\nI told him I was sorry to disappoint him, but I'm really miserable in my current job and need to make a change and this is the best offer I have.

Are you kidding - good executive assistants CLEAN UP! It's a great dynamic job!", "NTA. I went the \"secretarial\" path, when I really wanted to go into accounting and be a CPA. I was on that path for 16 years, and most of the time I really loved it. But eventually I wanted something more - I was a directors \"secretary\" and there was nothing more where I was. The title was secretary, but really it was more of an executive assistant, and they finally changed the title after I left. My ex didn't want me to change career paths, didn't support me in getting a degree, and wanted me to stay for \"job security\". It drove me crazy, and I really hated it eventually. I could do my work in half the day. If I'd stayed I'd still be doing the same thing, had less money and benefits and been stressed over layoffs several times. I might eventually have made more than I was making at the time, and I couldn't have already retired, but one thing I've learned about myself is I'm not someone to stay stagnant in a job and be happy. I want to do and learn more all the time. \n\nAfter our divorce, I chose to go side-ways into a different career (not accounting). I paid attention in my last secretarial job so I learned a lot that was not secretarial related at all but related to the new career. I loved my job, loved my boss, went back to school and finished my BA, started my MPA. I only left because my boss's boss was a micro-manager which I couldn't deal with because I was competent at my job and didn't need someone looking over my shoulder all the time. So I left for another employer and finished my education. I've been there over 10 years, and still enjoy my job.\n\nIt's important to discuss career and job changes with your spouse because they impact your family. BUT you also need to enjoy your job, have a path upward if you want it, and a way to increase your pay and benefits rather than remaining stagnant. Hating your job, working long hours for low pay, and not having any upward mobility are not a fun way to spend your career. It wears on you. And if your spouse isn't supportive of you having a fulfilling career, even if it means you change careers, that even makes it worse. \n\nBeing an executive assistant is neither inappropriate nor embarrassing.

I've always treated them as our extended team. I like to bake. If there are cookies for my team we drop some off to the EA and IT people. OP's husband is a pompous idiot. I've worked with my fair share of people like that. Most are men and their careers are often bumpy because they piss people off.", "Oh yikes, my mistake! Thank you for this", "Honey, throw the whole man away.", "It sounds like he thinks you\u2019re going to have an affair with the executive you\u2019ll be working for. Red flags everywhere. So misogynistic and elitist.", "OP please update us that you\u2019re taking the job!!!", "Ok so actively avoid people, It sound like he's one of those SE I meet very often, very factual with lack of emotional intelligence. I wonder if he really thought of what he said as constructive criticism. He might have no clue what's je saying.", "Honestly? The fact that the possibility of sabotage is even on your mind, is an indication that you *know*, deep down, that this relationship is not viable.\n\nA little-known fact is that manipulative, possessive men often manage to remain on their best behaviour for up to three years, by which time the woman is often trapped in a marriage, making it harder to escape. He's already begun to show you what he's like: that he's prepared to sulk and ignore you if you don't go along with what he wants for your life. That he judges you and thinks less of you for doing the things you want to do.\n\nGet out of this marriage before he breaks down your mental defenses. NTA.", "What he realises is that No matter what job I do or don\u2019t have I am still the same person. I still cook well. Take the cats to the vet because he is afraid of needles. He was a paratrooper and jumped out of planes and doesn\u2019t anymore. Still the same person. \n\nSo are you. We work to sustain ourselves and hopefully do something meaningful either to us or others. Sounds like this job will be a great fit for your skills and desires and that is wonderful, not shameful", "Perhaps this behavior should encourage you to think less of him.", "Interesting, something triggered him, and it obviously has nothing to do with you..", "Then he should be supporting you for advocating for yourself and improving your situation.", "He can control you better if you're tired from work and not making great money.", "Do not listen to them. You *absolutely* approached it as a partner and team member but your husband chose to think solely of himself. His concerns have *nothing* to do with you, your happiness or your mental and emotional wellbeing. He made it *very* clear that all he cares about is image and prestige.", "\ud83e\udd23", "That makes me feel better about my reference. Thank you. Lol", "If your IT can do stuff without a paper trail the company's security is garbage, damn. That's not a good thing.", "Which is really unhinged considering the CEO I will be supporting and I are both straight married women (he knows the CEO is a woman married to a man). And most of my new coworkers are women as well.", "If I give him the benefit of the doubt, I could try to think of his comments as trying to be helpful with good intentions, instead of trying to be hurtful. But it still stings a lot.", "I can never forgive you for what you've done \u26a1\u26a1", "OP, you are so young! I am in my 50s and I can't imagine spending the last 25 years with a husband who put me down like yours. Your new job sounds engaging and wonderful! I'm so proud of you! Call his bluff and let him leave if he doesn't like it. Make room for someone new who values you, or just enjoy being alone and fabulous.", "100% this!", "Do it quick so in case you do divorce, its *before* your big promotion & title jump. Because the career part will definitely happen.", "If your new boss is talking about future possibilities for you, they see potential in you. Remember that!", "Hear hear!", "Seriously! I didn\u2019t even know your age and I thought it was great. For a 25 year old, that\u2019s incredible.", "Good EA\u2019s are worth their weight in gold. And at large organizations are paid bank. \n\nThey are basically the personal operations director for the CEO.", "A lot even go into ops or chief of staff roles as a career trajectory. If you're smart and determined enough, I don't see why this isn't a good opportunity. I also think it's a great opportunity to dump your husband and find someone less egotistical and condescending", "Definitely take this job, and really give some thought about why your husband would think less of you for secretarial work. Think about the people you both know who aren't in \"high-powered executive positions.\" He admitted that he thinks less of these people. He admitted he'll think less of *you.*  In all honesty, that's deal-breaker territory for many people.", "To me that he\u2019d rather you stay in a job where you are unhappy, making less money and being taken advantage of by your employer for the sake of *his ego* (he seriously told you this would ruin your \u201clife plan\u201d WTF) is information you should be taking seriously. \n\nThe other thing this makes me wonder is *how does he treat the admins and VAs at his work place* because you might be getting a job in marketing but he sounds like his attitude comes from Mad Men.", "I work in software engineering and one of the most loved people in my company is our office manager. Even though most of us hardly ever visit the office nowadays", "This is probably what he's actually upset about. Feeling threatened that you have an opportunity to start making more money. Judging from his attitude and comments he sees your relationship as a power dynamic and wants to keep the upper hand.", "I also think your husband is an idiot, but I think you would be well served by asking yourself serious questions about your future. Do you want to build a future with a man who responds with outdated misogynist nonsense and tears you down if you make choices outside his rigid view of your lives? With a man who refuses to consider that he might not actually know everything on earth? Can you truly trust a man who says *to your face* that he doesn\u2019t respect you for being excited about a very good thing that you made happen for yourself? If you have kids, do you want them to be raised by someone who isn\u2019t hesitant to express his disdain for people he supposedly loves? \n\nAlso congratulations on the job. You are much more together than I was at 25!", "Always watch for red flags, even if it's 2 years in. \n\nI'm sorry he won't support you, this sounds like an amazing opportunity.", "Yeah I didn't ment to justify his behaviour, he definitely stinks, what I ment was that if he doesn't even realises he's doing anything wrong you might never be able to convince him about the opposite, let alone making him going to therapy or something like that, cause to him hes right and you act on your emotions which is unreasonable to him. \nHe might be completely oblivious.", "Thank you for all the good thoughts! \n\nI'm definitely reevaluating what life with my husband is going to look like if he doesn't change his tune quickly. It's going to be a huge draft to share my life with someone who puts me down at every turn or who can't celebrate my accomplishments just because they don't align with what he thinks is impressive or important.", "I'm sorry dude."]}
