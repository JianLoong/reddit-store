You were rude asking her to switch to English on your mother\u2019s behalf.", "Do you think speaking spanish is negative or shameful? Why are you so offended that someone assumed your mother speaks spanish?", "And it's been pointed out by others here, it's more that someone's first language is more comfortable to speak in - it doesn't mean anyone assumes you don't speak English.", "How good is your Spanish?\nDo you know what she said to your mother?\nDo you know that she didn't ask, in Spanish?\n\nYTA", "She was talking to your mother and your mom replied. I dont see how its any of your business what they are talking about. Perhaps you are insecure because you never learned you mom's native tongue?", "Not at Packer Barrel.", "I have a friend whose parents immigrated to the US from Mexico in their early 20s. Friend was born in the states and does not speak any Spanish other than a few basic phrases. People will look at him, where he lives (5 minutes from the US-Mexico border) and begin speaking Spanish to him. They get majorly offended when he just looks at them unable to respond because he doesn\u2019t understand what they said. (He studied Japanese as his secondary language in college and French or German in high school).", "It's crazy how the current gen takes offence to anything and everything \n\nIf someone look chinese I will speak to them in mandarin. If they don't understand they tell me hey I don't speak mandarin, I speak English. I apologise move on and continue the conversation in English. Same thing if they look Hispanic or Korean or whatever.\n\nThat's what languages are for! To converse.\n\nSince when did we start getting offended for using languages!?!?! Since when we gatekeep which language is allowed for public conversation. Since when English is the de facto compulsory language to converse in or else its super rude to do otherwise.\n\nIf u don't understand a language, tell the other person u don't and what u speak. There's nothing to take offence at\n\nIf someone doesn't understand your language, then the person should let u know, and yall can converse in whatever best you both understand. There's nothing to take offence at\n\nEverything can be done in 5 seconds. \n\nNot \"omg he thought I speak Spanish? How dare he, how rude!?\"\n\nDo humans not know how to human anymore? Yall just making arguments and non existing problems inside your own mind", "Haha, I question all my social interactions. If in doubt an apology goes a long way!\n\nI created a really awkward situation for myself a few weeks back.... I'm so used to being the boss of people. I was on a bus a couple of rows behind a lady and her kid, who was about 5yo and eating a lollipop. He threw the wrapper onto the guy sitting behind them without his mother seeing. Just impulsively I told him, \"hey mate you shouldn't throw rubbish onto the ground, save it for the bin.\" His mother turned to him and said the same thing. I felt so rude, and when I got off I apologised to her for overstepping and said it was just habit to speak up. Thankfully - so I can sleep at night - she appreciated I said something because she hadn't seen it herself and she wasn't offended. I still think about it.", "I have no bloody Idea what Cracker Barrel is...", "There wasn't a situation, except in your mind.", "oops i confused you with some dad who i was responding to earlier lol. i didn\u2019t know we could name locations but now i do. thank you.", "Apparently you can't call people that on this sub... Even though it's a sub dedicated to deciding if someone is an asshole or not.", "Yeah, that irks me. OP's mother has a voice of her own, and autonomy to use it. It's not his job to white-knight on her behalf. Especially when even OP said she was indifferent (i.e. didn't care) about it.

Secret menu win.", "They ask her.\n\nNothing about this post is racist", "I am European, and I disagree. \n\nFirstly, countries aren't ethnicities by default, so mocking people from Germany is 1000% not the same as commenting on \"ethnic Germans\" (however that is defined). \n\nSecondly, racism is broader than your definition. Making assumptions that people with different skin colours must have grown up in foreign countries is racist as it ties into the idea that your country is, by default, white. If you hear someone struggling with English, for example, and offer Spanish , obviously that is different.\n\nIts rude to assume something about someone just based on skin colour, as it removes all other aspects of them from the picture. Maybe their family has been in the US for 3 generations, and used to speak Portuguese but not since they emigrated. Suddenly every assumption is completely wrong and it could have been avoided by asking one question.", "This sounds like a cultural difference then - it is okay to assume people who look like they are from Spanish speaking countries speak Spanish if they are of a certain age. Maybe because there is no national language.\n\nIn the countries I've lived in, one should never assume someone in a country is not from that country unless you have a very good reason. I can list the ways you would be shouted at\n\n1. Assumed they are a migrant (and/or)\n2. Assumed they don't speak english\n3. Assumed the men don't speak spanish\n4.

Spanish is my second language and I'm not at a native fluency, but I've communicated with people in Spanish who had better English than my Spanish and they said it was because it was more comfortable for them. One woman told me it was because her kids and husband don't speak it so it was refreshing to get to communicate in her native tongue since I understood her well even if my responses weren't always fluent. I'll ask people which they prefer because of this. I'm never assuming they can't speak English but sometimes they prefer Spanish and who am I to exclude that as an option if they want it?", "It's a US chain.", "So you jumped to conclusions and got angry at someone - for not doing anything wrong, and trying to help - sort of sounds like the point of this post.   \n\n\nYTA", "So you like never stop and think and you always assume the worst? Charming", "got it lol", "Your dad commented???", "Thanks - fixed", "That\u2019s irrelevant to the discussion and I actually have no idea if they literally ask my wife because they just start conversing in Chinese. Exactly like the waitress and OP\u2019s mom.", "It definitely is a cultural issue. I don't think assuming is ever good, and it can definitely be looked at negatively here, but in places with a large immigrant population, it isn't considered as egregious. The issue is, there are places in the US that have just as many Spanish speakers as English speakers. I've been to places in Texas where most people didn't speak much English. Because so many people don't speak English, it's often not considered impolite to assume if we hear an accent, and Spanish accents are definitely different than Portuguese accents or other South American languages. Not only that, but most people who speak a language other than those two don't tend to migrate here. There are places in the US, especially in the north, where most Hispanic people speak English and often don't even speak Spanish, but then there's places like Texas where they only speak Spanish. Because the waitress was Hispanic herself, it could easily be assumed that she could tell the mom spoke English as opposed to another language, especially since I speak another language and can tell- I can even tell Spanish accents apart for a few countries and I'd bet she's even better at it than I am as a native speaker. Keep in mind how big the US is- every state is practically its own country, so what's acceptable in one state may not be acceptable in another, and this can even vary across states that are huge\n\nETA: the assumption is not usually made on skin color or age, just to be clear. It's based on accents, hearing them use the language, or being in an area that has a large Spanish speaking population. And it's only acceptable to assume if you're also Hispanic and Spanish speaking. I'm white and it's my second language, so it would be considered incredibly offensive for me to assume, but for other Hispanic people who often have the same struggles, it can be considered a way to connect. It's about sharing a culture and background different than that of other Americans. Plenty of racist people assume and speak in terrible Spanglish or they speak English like they're talking to a small child. Sometimes it's to belittle them, sometimes they think they're helping somehow but it's just because they're racist", "That\u2019s not really a difference - they often just speak Chinese first. I don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re saying.\n\nRacism is inherently bad as it assumes inferiority (or superiority) of one race over another.\n\nWhile stereotyping also over generalizes, it often doesn\u2019t have any inherent judgement. In fact, it\u2019s the bread and butter of many really funny comedians - and no one would say they\u2019re racist. Very, very different than racism.", "Sure.\n\nBut if it is only acceptable for hispanic looking people to open a conversation with an ambiguous brown person in Spanish that is also racist. Assumes that white people cant be properly Mexican, which further cements the binary way of viewing race in the USA.\n\nAh, who cares, I've lost the argument!", "In college writing one time we read a short paper on something to do with racism. They used all of the white racist stuff like black people stealing watermelon and general stuff white racists say about the different ethnic groups. Then they got to what a racist would say about white people if the roles were reversed. I can\u2019t remember what they were unfortunately but they were very accurate but also hilarious. I had a very hard time not laughing at what they would say about me while discussing it in class. I finally understood comedians.", "Ok, that's actually completely fine that your Asian wife isn't bothered by that. That doesn't mean every Asian (American) is fine with that. I'm Asian American, and I'm not a fan of people speaking without asking first. \n\nMost people at restaurants who do this sort of thing (speaking without asking first) are also immigrants, so that wouldn't bother me because they don't have the cultural context. But if a random American person on the street started speaking to me in Vietnamese, I'd definitely be like bro wtf \ud83d\udc80.\n\nI'm curious to know if your wife grew up in America because people's understanding of this behavior is likely going to change if they grew up experiencing racism or if they were part of the cultural hegemon.", "She grew up in Taiwan and didn\u2019t come here until grad school, so definitely has different cultural expectations.\n\nAnd - I agree context is key. We only eat at ethic places where most of the staff are immigrants and they certainly mean no offense. I think most nonwhite people - even my wife - would be offended if someone came up to them and randomly started speaking a different language without at least asking."]}
