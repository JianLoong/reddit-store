She (I'll call her Alex) was gonna join me after she finished work. I didn't mind waiting, I was off work earlier anyways. I suggested to meet her closer to her work if it was easier, she never answered that. So she said she would join me after 20min (when we made the plan to hang out, so leave work at 9 and meet me at 9:20). So again, fine waiting. And to be honest, I was expecting her to be late anyways. So I was ready to meet Alex not before 9:40. \n\nSo I was waiting, and that might be overly dramatic of me, but I was waiting alone, late at night on a \"party\" street. I don't do well around people. I have bad anxiety and I get really overwhelmed by crowds. Alex knows that. She knows a lot of my traumas and personal stuff. But I really wanted to see her.\n\nShe only texted me that she would be there soon. And again, I'm fine waiting. But she wouldn't answer when I asked whereabouts she was, just to get an ETA. \n\nShe eventually told me to get inside the bar and that she would be there in a sec. I am glad I didn't go in, cause I waited an extra 20min and still no sign of her. \n\nSo eventually, past 10pm, I left. I texted her and just started heading home, definitely overwhelmed and disappointed. We crossed paths while I was walking to my bus stop and Alex only said with a light mood \"where are you going\". I only said home and left. \n\nShe texted me saying she finished work late and came as fast as possible and didn't have service on transit. I told her I didn't mind waiting as long as I can have updates. Just so I know you are not ditching me or anything. She didn't even text something like \"I just left work, be there soon, maybe Xmin\" or anything like that. Only texted things like \"see you soon\"\n\nShe also said \"i know it sucks to be left waiting, but it's not like we had a time planned to meet up\" to which I simply send her a screenshot of her saying \"I should be there by 9:20\". \n\nSome people say it was just miscommunication and that she seems like she really wanted to hang out. That we shouldve plan things more clearly, but that seemed clear to me saying you'll be there by this hour and where we meet. So now I don't know if I overreacted or not. It all just sucked and I don't know what to think.\n\nEdit : I forgot to add that she still hasn't talked to me since", "created_utc": 1699331749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pmgh1/aita_for_leaving_after_my_friend_made_me_wait_for/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She definitely set up a time for the meet up. It's almost certain she knew that she wouldn't be able to make that time. She just didn't want to say, \"I really have no idea when I'll be able to make it there.\" It's not reasonable to expect someone to wait past 10-15 minutes when you agree upon a time.", "*\u201c I forgot to add that she still hasn't talked to me since\u201d -* very good. Cut the loss and count the blessing. She is not your friend.

I woulda left at 9:30", "NTA.... She is not a good friend. You need friends you can rely on. Someone that does not just expect you to wait until they decide to show up.  She knew about your anxiety and still did not update you on an ETA.", "Nta. She didn't say how long she wpuld be, or where  she was. You waited for 40 minutes past the scheduled time. That's shitty and shows a lack of respect for the person you are meeting up with on her part. She should have told you she was leaving work late and that there is no service on transit it's not like she wouldn't know this.", "I get you. I feel awkward as well when I have to wait somewhere alone or go someplace alone.

I know I'm late so I tell people to start without me or with my work being chaotic I will let people know if it's a game time decision or I can't make it as soon as possible. Also no way am I asking my friends to wait outside on the streets or in a bar late.\n\nThis is ridiculous, disrespectful behavior. She had plenty of time to tell you work got busy. Instead she knew it would be 10 (trust me) and wanted to see you so strung you along. No. You could have grabbed a coffee or something if she was honest about it taking an hour. There's no miscommunication, just disrespect and I say this as someone that's 10 minutes to an hour late for everything.", "yeah no. 9 20 is 9 20 and not after 10 or even later", "NTA You made specific plans, waited an extra 40 minutes after the allotted time, only received sporadic vague updates etc. If you met her whilst already on your way home it means she probably wouldn\u2019t have arrived to you till an hour after the appointed time, it costs nothing for her to let you know \u201cHey I left work late, be there in X, waiting for train/bus, off train/bus see you in X minutes\u201d. She knows she\u2019s responsible for this but doesn\u2019t want to accept it hence giving you the silent treatment.", "NTA. \nBeing late is a sign of disrespect. In future, leave after 15 minutes.", "NTA. Even if it was a miscommunication, leaving you there over an hour without so much as a text once she left work giving a time-frame for her arrival was an AH move, and I'd make it clear if we were to hang out in the future I will not be waiting for her again. People who refuse to respect other people's time are AH, full stop, because time is the one thing none of us can get back."]}
