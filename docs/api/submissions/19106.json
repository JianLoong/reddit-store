I also gave her the lists of exercises i cant physically do, and its alot.\n\nHer response was to tell me i wasnt pushing myself enough, that im not physically disabled, i can walk, talk, work, and so i should be able to do a jumping jack or a push up without issue, and that if i can't im being lazy by not trying.\n\nI tried again to explain i can replace jumping jacks with exercises involving weights, push ups simply need to be modified, and the like, and that if she cant accept it then i couldnt ge involved.\n\nShes told all our friends, has started sending me articles, upon articles, even videos from different influencers and even had her cousin whos a doctor message me saying she can give me a physical if i need, i dont need it my family doctor has done plenty.\n\nI saw her today and blew up at her, i yelled at her that this was harrassment, and to keep her nose out of my physical health, that she should have accepted no as a no, and that i will never be doing her videos, especially after this harassment and that if i saw one video of hers complaining about me or talking about my types of disabilities or conditions, id post my own video showing all the texts, harassment and blatant disregard for my disabilities.\n\nI stomped off after that and a few friends messaged me saying she started crying after i left, that she was just trying to help me get stronger, and push myself, and that i should applogize, so reddit, am i the asshole for yelling at her and telling her to keep her nose out of my physical health.\n\nEdit: no ones specifically asked, but i want to make it more clear, she is aware of the fact that my family has several genetic conditions, that physical and mental disabilities are all over my family, id give someone one hundred dollars to find someone in my family tree without some issue, ive never told her the entire story around all my issues, but she is aware that i do have some genetic conditions just not how painful or embarrassing they can be", "created_utc": 1686008458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141wbbu/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_get_her_nose_out_of/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is not your friend. You are an accessory to her. Someone to use. She not only doesn't respect your health, she's denying your intelligence and autonomy. She's using you as a whipping boy to her online \"community.\"  Friends don't use friends to boost themselves by compromising their friends.\n\nShe's throwing a tantrum because you won't damage your health to fuel her ego.", "NTA. \nShe is in absolutely NO position to be giving you medical advice, and she has NO business sharing your abilities/medical limitations with others. She was WAY out of line. While I generally think yelling is unhelpful and would have opted for a different approach, as someone with my own chronic medical conditions I can\u2019t help but hurt for you. I hope you realize this friendship is over though- most people aren\u2019t going to recover from such a harsh reaction.", "NTA.\n\nShe should mind her own business. Some of those fitness people get so uppity about being fit and eating right. I'm all for being healthy and maintaining a good exercise regime as it's important but you could still drop dead at the drop of a hat.\n\nTBH they should get rid of Tik Tok and stop all those teenage idiots doing stuff that gets them and others killed or seriously injured and hospitalised. There are idiot influencers using a nail file on their teeth and doing home dentistry, plus a long line of other dumb things. The platform is a disaster zone.", "NTA - to be honest I was on your side at the word Influencer. And her behavior and dismissal of your physical limitations just reinforces my distaste for influencers. \n\nYou're right, it's none of her business and she needs to learn to stay in her lane.", "NTA she has to learn to respect boundaries.", "NTA. I have limitations from a back injury 7 years ago, even though on the outside most times I look fine. I can walk and work out and be active, which helps my back issues, but I have plenty of things that cause serious problems for me that people just don't understand, and it's infuriating to hear those assumptions from people like her. Of course she turns on the water works and gets everyone on her side with her sympathy tears too, that's generally how people like her work. She was in the wrong 100% so I wouldn't feel bad one bit.", "NTA\n\nShe asked you to participate, you gave your conditions and she rejected them. Should have ended there, anything after that is her fault.", "NTA. At 18, she is in no way eligible to give (push) medical advice.", "NTA and please don't apologize. She is not a medical professional and therefore is not qualified to say what will help you \"get stronger\". I also find her comments condescending. You are working within your physical boundaries, and she should respect that. Full stop. \n\nHaving modified workouts doesn't mean that you'r not pushing yourself. That's so rude of her to say.", "I love hearing that someone has made an ableist cry.  Wish you had video of it.  NTA from another disabled person.", "NTA. Your friend broached a subject and kept pushing and pushing and pushing. You tried to accommodate her requests and she just wouldn't give up.\n\nYou know your body and your comfort limits. She should have just listened to you. If she's also 18, she prolly just hasn't learned to respect other people's boundaries. Hopefully she can learn from this experience.\n\nYour body, conditions, diet are your business. There is absolutely no reason why you should feel like you owe an explanation to anyone. If it were me, I would have worried that if I gave her any personal info it would end up in a tik tok. Watch your back at all times.\n\nSo she cried, hopefully she learned from it. Please don't go back to her and apologize. The ball is in her court and she's the person who owes you an apology.", "NTA unless you blindsided her in a group of people.  Hard to tell from your post.  \n\nProbably best to have that conversation in private.", "NTA. She needs to be held accountable for her actions.

She\u2019s a lowly tic tok girl who is not a doctor. Who cares what some stupid influencer has to say or the so called Dr that will give you a physical. Your \u201cfriend\u201d was rude and you were polite many times. She deserved what you said and more. Any person not defending you is wrong. Just because you didn\u2019t cry to them doesn\u2019t make her right. Just because she cried doesn\u2019t make what she did right.", "NTA - she needs to learn to respect people when they say no, & to educate herself on the medical conditions that you have...", "NTA She asked, you told her your conditions. She refused, then harassed you when you declined. She wasn't going to stop until you blew up at her. Maybe now she'll think twice before judging someone's abilities or butting into their medical business.", "Nta. The only A post I see is telling you to handle it the way you originally did. Having the same person trying to force you beyond your abilities can be absolute he'll. Worse when doing those things have strong negative effects. \nI know a few disabled people and have seen similar things happen to them, for life things, not videos, though. Things going directly against drs' orders, and some of them were present for those orders. It doesn't surprise me you blew up. It happens, and it sounds like she deserved it. \nYou have enough proof of her disregarding your disability and harassment to make a whole video. If she tries to bad mouth you and you truly need to use it, you wnbta if it comes to that either. It's called fafo for a reason.", "NTA but people who refuse to understand hidden disabilities 100% are! \n\nThere are days I can do anything, and there are days I can\u2019t even stand up in the shower. \n\nShe\u2019s a jerk who is severely lacking empathy.", "NTA at all. I am physically disabled. I can walk and talk and work just like your bone-headed friend said but I cannot jump, run, do push ups, etc. I have severe rheumatoid arthritis in every joint of my body. I don\u2019t look \u201csick\u201d but my hospital bills and medical notes would say otherwise.\nMy biggest peeve is when people who have ZERO idea of what you\u2019re dealing with come at you with a diet you should try, or hypnosis, or a certain exercise because it will help and possibly cUrE yOu!! I\u2019ve told off many people because of this after calmly telling them their advice wasn\u2019t needed nor was it correct. They still kept at it and that\u2019s why I lost it. \n\nShe was extremely out of line. Maybe your final reaction will make her rethink her actions in the future.", "NTA, but I feel like a more logical explanation for her would have helped instead of that you simply couldn\u2019t do those things. \n\nYou are under no obligation to divulge medical information but it seems like she didn\u2019t understand that you DO have a disability. If she\u2019d known that earlier or you made it more clear, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have escalated.", "I\u2019m not backing off my vote. I have benefit of 6 decades mixing it up with people, and our OP is 18.  He might not like my view now, but he will soon enough. \n\nSave your outbursts for situations that desperately need it. Be the adult in the room. People piss me off all the time, but it requires special circumstances for me to unload on someone. I don\u2019t do it out of anger or irritation, unless there I see immediate need to INTERRUPT the asshole.", "YTA. Close call, but you do didn\u2019t need to blow up. Learn to be firm and stern. \n\nLike this: \u201cPlease Stop! There are things you Don\u2019t Know!  Leave it alone. [then smile and ask] OK?\u201d\n\n\n\nI realize you are young, and this an acquired skill\u2026\u2026.", "Her heart was in the right place and you probably overreacted.\n\nSoft YTA", "NTSlA and why do I smell MLM vibes?", "NTA. She offered to give you a physical? She thinks being a TikTok influencer somehow gave her a medical degree? Unsolicited and unsupported and uneducated advice on medical issues should never be listened to and both she and her flying monkeys have bought WAY too far into her hype.", "NTA - I HATE influencers", "NTA. End this friendship.", "NTA. You said no and no is enough. When someone continues, they're pushing. And to go outside you and too others? Nope!\n\nWhen you're disabled in *any* capacity nothing gets more infuriating than denial. Not all disabilities are blatant. People have no right to your medical information. Nor is it enjoyable to continually offer explanations again and again. Explanations that get pushed because, \"You don't look disabled.\" \"You can't be that bad off\" \"You can do XYZ so your disabilities can't be legitimate.\" \"You're exaggerating\" \n\nEtc.\n\nThe world is already difficult to navigate when disabled. Getting frustrated with continued invalidation is understandable here.", "NTA, she is behaving like a spectacular asshole. It's a heartbreakingly common bit of idiocy that people think if you 'just do enough' and 'try harder' you can fix any health condition. They basically want to think that good things happen to good people, so people who have bad things happen to them must just not be 'good' enough. They also find it very hard to sit with uncomfortable realities like, idk, 'I find it hard find the energy to wash my hair', and they want to FIX every problem for every person using the only thing they're experts in - raging smugness. \n\nMost of these idiots just spend their whole lives telling depressed people to try yoga or telling people with cancer to try vitamin C injections or telling people with chronic fatigue to just get on the treadmill and everyone just quietly hates them.\n\nYour friend actually has the opportunity right now to realise how much hurt she caused you and to pull her head out of her fitspo-toned ass. She may or may not do this, but she's got a chance. Do not apologise - that's on her - and explain to your clueless friends that 'pushing yourself' the way she wants you to could land you in the hospital and do they want that and if they don't want that, could they please stop enabling her toxic positivity wellness bullshit in the presence of actual disability.", "NTA. People only like to accept invisible disabilities when they are convenient for them. I\u2019ve had to weed out a few friends who refuse to accept that I have epilepsy and it means I can\u2019t do certain things. Like no, I\u2019m not trying to be a buzzkill, but an edm show is not a great time for me because strobing lights everywhere. Your friend in this situation doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that you have physical limitations and it\u2019s not okay. Sorry you\u2019re having to experience this, it sucks a lot and is never fun to have people try to discredit your medical needs", "NTA. She could\u2019ve made it a whole thing and talked about different exercises for different people and stuff like that. Instead she acted like a huge ableist asshole.", "NTA. She is no friend and an ableist to boot", "Or fitness advice", "He made himself pretty damn clear in my opinion. Shouldn't have to say it more than once or twice but clearly she had no intentions of actually listening.", "You mean being a door mat? 'No' is a complete sentence.", "She knows my family has a genetic history of different physical issues, i guess i kinda assumed since she knew that it was enough, but i guess its true what they say about assuming", "Doesn't matter if it was or not. I met plenty of people whos hearts were in the right place who refused to listen to a word I said about my body and my chronic pain and my limitations, and based everything off assumptions. It's impossible to have any sort of fuse when you have explained all these things to every doctor, specialist, surgeon, physiotherapist, chiropractor, friend, family member, freinds family members, family member's friends, and anyone else you encounter where your condition comes up, the list goes on and on. And most people just ignore everything that comes out of your mouth and just see \"well, they can walk so they must not be disabled\". Hearing that when you just told someone about your disability is impossible to not blow up and it's soemtimes the only way to get through to people like her.", "OP said they had a modified workout (medically), and her response was condescending and rude AF. To me it crosses so many boundaries, and that isn't someone with their heart in the right place.\n\nThat's someone who wants to be right for their so called audience, more than they want to be a supportive friend.", "Ableists don't have hearts.", "Or dietary advice.", "Exactly. I can walk. I can walk perfectly fine, except for the times it causes a random subluxation in my hip and I have to pop it back in. But I can walk, so I must be fine. (My connective tissue is not fine, which leads to a lot of fun things, like only realising in my 20s that subluxations aren\u2019t normal.)"]}
