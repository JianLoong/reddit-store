I wouldn't have bothered telling the front desk about it, it's a bit much considering he didn't even try to talk to you or hit on you or make any advancements at all. it's tough tbh, I feel bad saying YTA in this situation because I know you meant well and couldn't have known he wasn't looking at you. but EVEN if he was, it's not a crime, and because of your decision to tell the front desk, he was falsely accused of being a creep and almost got kicked out of his gym. yta... sorry :/", "You're not an asshole for genuinely thinking there was an issue and it being a mistake.

He did not want to speak with you and you waited outside the bathroom for him? That is incredibly inappropriate and, frankly, creepy. Leave the poor man alone. \nAnd in the future, before making a complaint, maybe move and see if the uncomfortable action persists.", "NTA. Yeah you jumped the gun but let's face it, it does happen. The fact guy isn't like yelling at you or screaming about you almost getting him into trouble shows he might understand but I would give him space. Maybe in a few months or so, yeah apologize if you can but don't rush it.  There is a chance he could complain to the staff that you're harassing him and the false accusation could be used against you. Men are terrified of false accusations because yes women are normally believed over men in situations like this.", "It was good that you tried to make up for it.  But he's still hurting from this, and he's under no obligation to accept your apology.\n\nYou're NTA for apologizing.  If you PUSHED, you would be.", "I mean. This isn\u2019t necessarily an asshole move but I also find it hard to believe the manager would threaten to cancel your subscription after one complaint. \n\nNext time, make sure he\u2019s leering, ask him to stop, or leave and come back another time. \n\nBeing a woman at the gym can be shitty but you\u2019ll learn to navigate it. You might be more comfortable with group exercise or bringing a friend.", "NTA for making a complaint (I think anyone would, as a feminine person who has dealt with a similar situation before) but you are the asshole for continuing to try and apologise after the fact when he clearly didn\u2019t want one. You should have just let it go.", "The irony is by waiting outside the men's room and following him to try apologise, OP actually became the creep...", "YTA - Classic asshole now wants their victim to accept their apology so that they can feel absolved. He does not owe you that OP, accept it and move on.", "This post reminds me of another today where an \u2018underaged 21 year-old\u2019 woman claims a guy is leering at her.", "that's a good question and sorry I was not more clear in the OP. He was never kicked out, he left the first day after I reported him because I made him uncomfortable. The manager told me that when I was meeting him in his office.", "This is what I was thinking. Waiting for him to come out of the dressing room? That\u2019s super creepy behavior.", "probably a little weirded out but on the same hand, I'm 5'1 and weight 115lbs. I'm not very threatening.", "I think OP is the type of female that thinks if a man asks her if she's using a piece of equipment, she thinks the man wants her and is hitting on her.", "most guys don't hit on me, it's the staring that makes me uncomfortable.", "OP needs to work out at home. Alone.", "This. A thousand times this.\n\nI agree with the people saying the woman is basically a creep, basically doing the very things that she would get upset about if it roles were reversed. \n\nI think this woman should definitely have her gym subscription revoked.", "I don\u2019t blame her for not approaching him because confronting someone can be dangerous. Also because she could be blatantly wrong like she was here. It should be taken to the front desk so they can properly deal with it and check the cameras for the facts.", "honestly I'm not an expert but because it was a \"reflection of reflection\" in the mirror, it made him look like he was staring directly at me.", "At this point he did nothing and she is stalking him. He should speak to the front desk about this harassment.", "She was the one leering at him, but I guess she\u2019s the type of woman who believes men can\u2019t be harassed.", "I wish I had an award to give you. This is woke culture at its finest (in destroying people's lives). \n\n'felt like he was staring'. Jesus Christ.", "I agree OP is TA, but I don\u2019t agree that every woman is automatically out of line for being creeped out by (and reporting) someone staring at them. I stopped going to the gym because I was constantly being ogled (as a 16-17 year old girl, at that). I want to work out at the gym, not be painfully aware that someone is undressing me with their eyes.", "She absolutely should NOT have the manager approach him on her behalf or get him a gift card. This man has asked her to leave him alone and that\u2019s what she should do. Having a manager deliver an apology that she has already delivered herself is not leaving him alone. Any further attempts would just be to alleviate her guilt.", "Heck no! Leave him alone! She\u2019s lucky she\u2019s not reported for her harassment of him. They would have footage of her waiting by the locker room too. She needs to swallow her guilt and move on.", "The manager probably just stated that to OP.", "The reason you\u2019re getting downvoted is because she accused someone of doing something he clearly wasn\u2019t even doing and reported him and risked his own well-being.\n\nIf it was so obvious from the security camera\u2019s that he was looking down at his phone watching videos, it would have been perfectly obvious to her that his eyes were not looking at her.\n\nInstead, she saw someone who\u2019s body was pointed in her general direction and reported him for existing.\n\nSo, you saying she\u2019s NTA for that? That\u2019s why you\u2019re getting downvoted", "both for sure.", "\"You didn't know he wasn't looking at you\" lol what?  So men can't even look in the general direction of a female or he gets blamed for assaulting someone. Ridiculous\n\n\nEdit: spelling", "Trying to talk to someone who has made it clear that they want nothing to do with you is a bad idea. Harrassing him into taking her apology to assuage her guilt will certainly make her an AH.", "A 21 year old is not underaged.", "And then, when you tried to talk to him and he told you to stop talking to him, **you kept talking to him.**\n\nLeave people alone when they tell you to leave them alone, creep.", "You really suck. YtA.", "Forget about your self-centered, \u201c I\u2019m the center of the universe little world\u201d, and look at it from his perspective. \n\nSome misandry crazed lady lies about him to get him kicked out of the gym, the next time he is at the gym the lady who lied about him approaches him and he makes is crystal clear that he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you \u2026 and you follow him and wait outside the locker room. \n\nHow TF can you NOT understand that YTA?  You are 1000% the creepy stalker that you falsely accused him of being. \n\nJust to go a different gym and learn to be a better person. A lot of people here will make a millions excuses for your actions, but it wasn\u2019t right and your harassing and stalking the guys isn\u2019t right either.", "Find a new gym. Grow up.", "YTA, you\u2019re only apologizing to absolve yourself of your guilt. That makes you an even bigger asshole than you were in the beginning", "Imagine what op would be saying about him if he waited outside the bathroom for her.", "So you\u2019re trying to justify your behavior because you\u2019re not physically threatening.  You almost got a person kicked out because of your false accusations and to appease your conscience you\u2019re following him so you can apologize and feel better. He should complain to the manager about you.", "And yet you managed to harass him no problem", "How \u201cthreatening\u201d is your ability and willingness to lie about a guy and have people believe you with literally zero evidence (and literal evidence to the contrary)?\n\nThat is the definition of threatening. Being completely innocent and getting fucked because someone was having a \u201cbad day\u201d.", "Imo a person of any size is threatening when they repeatedly cross boundaries like you did. I would be extremely creeped out and threatened by your behavior.", "Cool story, still harassment.", "As awful as I feel about agreeing with you\u2026 I do.", "Generally there's mirrors everywhere. You can't look anywhere in a gym without accidently locking eyes with 3 different people. If you're that offended by men then join a woman's gym. Its not like we can go to an all male gym because that would be sexist.", "Most guys probably aren\u2019t staring at you, you\u2019re just self involved enough to think they would.", "Oh yes. Confronting someone in a gym, where you see the same people every day and where the front desk can figure out who everyone is, is dangerous.", "Thank you for answering. I have no idea of the layout of that place so I can't fully understand which is why I asked. Either way, it's best for everyone involved if you just leave him alone. The only thing that benefits from you trying to explain yourself is your ego. Intentional or not, you've done enough.", "This he wants nothing to do with her.  It\u2019s not up to him to alleviate her guilt.  She needs to quit harassing him.", "You want him to appease your conscience. That\u2019s why you keep trying to apologize.  Yet in doing so you are actively harassing him.  Let it go move on.  He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you.", "I agree. Reporting someone for something you don't know they aren't doing is insane.  That would be exactly the same as calling the police on someone standing on the sidewalk because you don't know they aren't stealing cars. \n\nThis was not an assault. He didn't touch or even speak to her. His \"crime\" was having his eyelids open. Even if he was looking in her direction, I don't get how that is a crime.  What are we going to charge him with exactly?\n\nYou need to be sure before you cause an innocent person to be punished and embarrassed.", "She said it seemed like he was staring at her. \n\nShe didn\u2019t know he wasn\u2019t. \n\nRather be safe than the victim of a kidnapping, honestly.\n\nShe told someone. Not like she threatened to fight him.", "I'm not saying she should stalk him. Just a \"Hey I'm sorry.\" if he ever approaches her.", "He wrote it in quotes so I imagine that's how she described herself", "I can't even use a machine with eventually making accidental eye contact with someone.", "Exactly!", "Yes. This. \n\nIf only there was a way to move ones body so that it was in a different location to see if the stare was at her or just pointed general direction that had nothing to do with her. Since she clearly couldn't see his eyes. Maybe one day evolution will bless humanity with some kind of self propulsion. Until then, better safe than sorry. Anyone pointing their head in your direction at the gym is probably a kidnapper.", "You know when someone is staring at you. Dude was staring at his phone the whole time. She assumed he was staring at her", "I doubt he's ever going to approach her. She needs to move on and leave him alone. That means not holding out hope for a chance to apologize in the future.  As it is she's already been an AH by persisting after he said he didn't want to talk to her. Waiting for him to come out of the bathroom was out of line.", "Yes, I understand that.", "And when she watched from a different angle, she realized he wasn\u2019t. Perspective makes a difference too.", "Maybe for a few seconds. But not for a long time like OP said."]}
