We both have kids from previous relationships. My husband has 2 kids (10 & 8) and I have a 17-year-old daughter who will turn 18 this summer. Both my daughter and I are huge Taylor Swift fans and have tickets to see her this weekend. We were not lucky enough to get tickets right when they went on sale, so we had to buy them on the secondary market and paid a lot for them. My daughter helped pay for about 1/3 of the cost out of her own pocket.\r  \n\r  \nLast weekend my daughter was babysitting my step-kids when my husband got home about 2 hours earlier than he planned. He found his kids inside, but couldn't find my daughter. He eventually found her and 3 friends out in the backyard smoking pot. To say he was livid would be a severe understatement. He kicked her friends out and yelled and screamed at my daughter to the point she was in tears. By the time I got home he was still incredibly angry and my daughter had locked herself in her room crying.\r  \n\r  \nAfter talking with both of them, my husband now has zero trust in my daughter and my daughter knows what she did was wrong and a very bad decision. If my husband had his way, she would be grounded for life, but obviously that's not going to happen. His suggestion for punishment was to take away the Taylor Swift concert and sell the tickets.\r  \n\r  \nI completely understand why he's upset and I am very disappointed in my daughter as well. What she did was reckless, stupid, and indefensible. But both of us have been looking forward to this concert for months and as far as I'm concerned, this is literally a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. I agree that my daughter needs to have consequences for messing up like she did, but I don't feel that punishment fits this crime.\r  \n\r  \nNone of the other punishments I've suggested have been acceptable to my husband. Taking away her car, phone, grounding, making her do chores, etc. To him it's the concert and nothing else is going to work. He says that she needs to know that what she did is unacceptable and that when you mess up as bad as she did there needs to be severe consequences. He says that if I still take her to this concert I'm basically teaching her that even if she messes up massively, I will still let her do fun things.\r  \n\r  \nBut to me, she's almost an adult and she knows what she did was wrong. We also both paid quite a bit of money for these tickets and even though we could make that money back by selling them, we would be missing out on a huge experience together. My daughter is also afraid of my husband now because no one has ever yelled at her the way he did and he doesn't seem to care.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband will barely acknowledge my daughter at home now and is barely speaking to me either. He feels like I'm trying to sweep this under the rug and that I care more about this concert than the safety and well-being of my step-kids.", "created_utc": 1687545755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h692b/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_to_see_the_taylor/", "score": 765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He also doesn't seem to care that he would also be hurting and punishing you in the process.", "I think I'd go with ESH.\n\nI feel like OP is downplaying the severity. That the daughter is irresponsible after agreeing to babysit for money. The stepdad is for yelling - even though it might be warranted. \n\nAlso I got the feeling that the daughter isn't scared but rather embarrassed.\n\nThe only ones not an AH are the younger kids, which seemed to behave nicely. \n\nAll that said - I lean towards what another user posted in regards of you downplaying things. That dad gets the feeling the the concert is more important then the children.", "ESH.\n\nThis would be a different story if your husband just discovered your daughter and her friends smoking. The tipping point is that they were smoking while babysitting.\n\nYour husband splits custody, correct? Things like this could affect his custody arrangement. Someone calling the cops could have lead to even larger consequences. If the kids had an emergency there was no longer someone sober to drive them.\n\nI understand the chances of *any* of that happening were extremely low, and that 98 times out of 100 nothing happens. It\u2019s that 2 percent that makes this dangerous, even if things don\u2019t reach worse case scenario.\n\nSo your daughter is an A for breaching this trust. This wasn\u2019t just choosing to smoke, this was potentially harming other people.\n\nYour husband is an A for not compromising. This isn\u2019t about discipline, it\u2019s about causing your daughter pain. \n\nThat being said, I can\u2019t help but wonder if you would be okay with his demand if it was any other concert. \n\nI also have to wonder: if your daughter made the exact same choices and something *had* happened, would you still allow her to go? If not, why should the punishment change just because she got lucky?\n\nI think there is a way to convey the seriousness of the situation to your daughter while also allowing her to go. \n\nHowever, I think the important thing is to convey to both your daughter and your husband thy at you believe this was a big deal, because I do think it was a big deal. Neither you nor your husband agreed to allow your children to be watched by someone impaired. Neither of you agreed to risk to those consequences to yourselves and to all your children, including your daughter.", "EDIT-Based on OP\u2019s response that her daughter has engaged in similar bad behavior in the past, including drinking so much she had to get her stomach pumped, I\u2019m changing my answer to YTA. It sounds like she hasn\u2019t experienced significant consequences from her bad choices and this latest thing where she invited friends over and got high while watching your husband\u2019s kids was his final breaking point. \n\nI N F O - Is this the first time your daughter has done something like this that you\u2019re aware of? \n\nIf she has gotten into trouble in the past, what consequences has she faced?", "It's not great, but c'mon, he never had a couple beers in the backyard while the kids played video games indoors? If they're typical 8 and 10 year olds, they're way past the choking on a Lego stage and don't need to be stared at nonstop. He doesn't remember latchkey kids? Eight is a little iffy, but 10 is the ideal time to leave a kid alone for brief periods, as long they're fairly responsible. Too old to do dangerous baby stuff, not old enough to do dangerous teen stuff.\n\nHow often does he have her babysit? Does he pay her? Has he been stewing on various resentments and this is just the opportunity to lay the hammer down and seem justified?\n\nIt's not a great situation, but wasting money won't resolve it.

I was busted at her age and my parents grounded me without regard for the fact that I had scored Led Zeppelin tickets.\n\nSo yeah, I think YTA and I have three grown children so I have been there.", "INFO How is custody of his kids split? Is there an amicable coparenting relationship between your husband his ex?\n\nSee, if it's not amicable, then the ex can use this in court to gain full custody.", "Info:  your daughter was driven to tears by your husband yelling, but has she actually apologized?", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is clearly seeking revenge against your daughter and you too.  He's not looking to hold her accountable, he is being petty and vengeful.\n\nNot letting your daughter go to the concert if it were only her and her friends might be an appropriate punishment.  That's not the case though - this is a mother/daughter trip that you both planned, and he wants you to cancel that.  That is 100% disrespectful to you.\n\nYour daughter can (and should) be punished and held accountable in ways that do not deny or impact the experience that you have been looking forward to.\n\nBTW, I've known plenty of parents that have smoked weed with kids younger than your step-kids... who are doctors, lawyers, corporate executives, professors, etc.  Your husband is hell bent on punishment based on values, not responsibility.\n\nYou should have a talk with your daughter about responsible cannabis use though.  She is too young.  It has detrimental permanent effects on brain development until around age 26.  After then, she can smoke all she wants.  Until then, you should confiscate her weed. Also consider making some special brownies for you to enjoy at the concert, and making her be your designated driver.", "He's already punishing her emotionally and psychologically by being hostile to her. He's definitely handling the situation so poorly. \n\nHave you tried talking to her instead of punishing her? Both of you as her parents? \n\nAlso, the same way he wants to protect his children, you need to protect your child. You can't let your husband cross boundaries just because she made a mistake. \n\nShe's a teenager, it's expected of her to make mistakes. And her siblings are not even so small, nothing would've happened even if your husband hadn't come home earlier.", "Yta. Smoking weed while she\u2019s supposed to be watching your step children and your still considering rewarding her???? I\u2019m a big advocate for marijuana but underage while caring for kids after leaving them alone is too far. Question: Is there anything she could\u2019ve done where you would agree with taking the concert away? Maybe you just want to go and don\u2019t want to go alone?", "I don't understand all these N T As. She didn't just \"mess up babysitting,\" she was being pretty goddamn negligent as the \"adult\" in this situation. And I say this as a lifetime pothead. \n\nYour husband is correct, a suitable punishment would be taking away something that is a big fucking deal to her. Sounds to me you're trying to be the \"fun parent;\" you need to talk to your husband and come down as a united front. Just taking away her car for a week doesn't have the impact taking away something she's really looking forward to would. She fucked up big time and needs to realize that. I'm 40 and smoke daily, but when I'm watching my nephew I obstain. If something serious were to happen, I need to be in a clear state of mind. \n\nIt does, however, sound like your husband came on a little strong. My dad would've acted the same way when I was that age, but that's irrelevant. \n\nESH. Your husband for maybe being too forceful, your daughter for betraying the responsibility you gave her, and you for trying to be the fun parent and not side with your husband.", "Even in a legal state, she's underage, and she did this while neglecting children she was being paid to watch. Daughter messed up BAD here, even if things turned out OK. \n\nIf my kid did this, I would take away her concert ticket, but let her earn it back. One toe out of line, and she doesn't get to go with you and your SD. \n\nTo be clear, I wouldn't be that upset about the pot on its own, it's the shockingly bad judgement of getting high while children are in her care that I take issue with.\n\nI feel like you're too easy on her here, and hubby is too hard.

Reddit's mental gymnastics may make you feel better but won't repair the likely permanent damage you've done to your husband's trust and your relationship as co-parents", "ESH.  Your husband reaction is over the top.  The appropriate reaction would have been kick the friends out and tell the step daughter that he'd discuss the situation with her mother when she got home.  \n\nThese are 8 & 10 year old  kids.  They don't need constant supervision.  But they do need someone that is clear headed and capable of \nhandling emergencies. Weed impairs decision making  and reaction time. It also means she isn't capable is driving without being under the influence. She's also not 18, so regardless of state, she's breaking the law and setting a terrible example for her step siblings.  That makes her a A H too \n\nAs for mom - she sucks because her explanations for why the concert is off limits as a punishment are BS.  Bonding with daughter means \"Don't want to be the bad guy \" and she could sell the tickets.   \n\nTo me -  the punishment would be dependent upon many thing we don't know from the story.  Does she get paid to baby sit? How often does she baby sit? Does she get in trouble often?   Punishment needs to teach a lesson and change future behavior.  The concert may be a necessary lesson, or maybe too extreme.  But mom's reasoning for not considering the concert is as unreasonable as the husbands reaction, without knowing more about the past.", "NAH\n\nYour husband is right she needs to be punished, but you disagree on the punishment, neither of you is necessarily right or wrong.

I understand what you're saying, and I think there is a way to punish her without taking away the concert. That being said, I can't call your husband an A because he wants a big punishment for what happened. Hopefully you can find a resolution that works for everyone, good luck.", "ESH your daughter messed up, majorly.  While the children aren't babies, she left them unattended in the house, had friends over, and was smoking pot when she was supposed to be in charge of the household.\n\nYou seem more concerned about missing it yourself than dealing with her, though I acknowledge you did suggest other punishments.\n\nYour husband sucks because while he's entitled to be angry, very angry, ultimately this is your daughter, and he shouldn't get to unilaterally decided her punishment.", "INFO: how do you and your husband usually approach parenting the kids? Do you each have full rights and agreement to discipline your respective step children, or do you generally leave discipline to the genetic parent?\n\nI get why your husband is angry, but I think it\u2019s important to know if him setting the punishment is the standard for your relationship to date, or if he\u2019s stepping out of the normal boundaries.", "YTA.

This is actually not a punishment offense (kicking the friends out is the for the best, though), but it definitely warrants a talk about recreational pot usage. A 10 and an 8 year old will be fine for a few minutes unless they aren't raised well and can cause havoc in a split second. There's no mention of the siblings being like this, and furthermore, Dad's reaction paints a different story he comes off as a man shamed for his teenage indiscretions and feels its appropriate to get personal to get even. If that isn't the case, then I think you and step need to have a conversation about why he reacted the way he did.", "Let\u2019s be honest here OP.

I get that you want to share the experience with her, but very frankly, its not a once in a lifetime thing, Taylor Swift will absolutely tour again.

Do they not understand this is probably the biggest dumb shit you can do when you're responsible for two kids? You would be equally or more livid than the father if this had happened to you.\n\nYTA. Teaching your daughter responsibility is more important than a Taylor Swift concert. It's not a once in a lifetime event. She does concerts often. \nGetting high when you're supposed to be watching over little kids with your friends is the height of irresponsibility. A multitude of things could go wrong and if they did, she would be in no state to handle it. Consequences should be there for messing up, especially when you mess up that bad. You tell us that she's almost 18 and understands her mistake. If teenagers understand things easily then she wouldn't be making this dumb decision. YOU are a huge asshole, OP. Because if the roles were reversed, and your husband's child was babysitting your daughter and got high with friends, when the children were in the house, you wouldve been equally livid, even more. You're taking her side because you want to go to the concert. I remember reading similar posts where the kids made the same mistake and were heavily punished in this forum. He's not out for revenge. His actions would actually teach your child that doing dumb shit like this would have devastating aftereffects. And your child doing shit like this at 17, and crying because no one has yelled at her before just proves that she's been coddled by you too much. The fact that shes smoking weed when there are kids in the house is a separate matter.\n\nMaking her do chores as punishment? That's something you're expected to do when you're living with family. You let her go because you wanted to go to the concert. It's as simple as that. You mentioned that you're both fans and you paid a hefty sum for the ticket more than once. You say that she's an adult and understands her mistakes but you fail to understand that this is not a mistake a 17 year old is expected to make. This is not a mistake. It's a choice. A really dumb stupid one. And there should be consequences proportionate to how badly you messed up.", "YTA. You're not taking this seriously.\n\n>I agree that my daughter needs to have consequences for messing up like she did, but I don't feel that punishment fits this crime.\n\nIt is quite specifically the fact that you think the punishment doesn't fit the crime that he takes issue with. You think the concert is a big deal and neglecting his children isn't. This is *his children's safety* that you consider nothing compared to Taylor Swift. He won't just get over that.\n\nHe trusted his children with her and hanging out with her friends smoking weed while the children are awake and unsupervised is the opposite of babysitting.

Getting high in the backyard is a mistake.\n\nGetting high in the backyard while you're responsible for two young kids is potentially deadly.\n\nThis is not a simple whoopsie.

Stop saying your husband overreacted because \"nothing happens\", something happens, your daughter badly betrayed his trust.

I do not blame the dad at all for yelling in that scenario said as someone that smokes weed all the time.

As they were underage, they would have been forced to go to drug counseling, do community service, and pay fines, depending on where you live. Also, the other kids\u2019 parents would have found out, and your kid would have become a social pariah. Would you have given up the Taylor Swift tickets to prevent that? You need to actually think about what could have happened, and what the real-world repercussions would be.  Missing a concert isn\u2019t life altering. Other consequences could have been way worse, and your husband could have taken that route - and it would have been perfectly legal and appropriate to do so.", "The phrase that comes to mind is \"this hurts me more than it hurts you\".

She was doing something illegal in the vicinity of the young kids while neglecting her responsibility. Even if weed is legal in your state, she (and presumably her friends) are still minors. Also just super not ok to be responsible for young children and getting high. They likely notice something is 'off' even if they don't understand exactly what's going on.

There must be more appropriate punishments.\n\nShe's almost an adult so just trying to make her miserable isn't going to teach her anything when she's already aware of what she's done wrong.

Again a sit down conversation about why he was concerned and why she thought this was ok to do is going to benefit everyone.\n\nAs for the actual issue of tickets, maybe this would be a valid punishment but she put her own actual money that she earned down on them.

Yes, there should be consequences but this is a once in a lifetime thing and she can be punished in other ways and in the end it is YOUR decision.

This leads me to infer that he sees you as being a softer parent, and if you take away her car or phone, she\u2019ll likely get it back sooner than agreed to, and she won\u2019t learn anything, diminishing the gravity of what she did to your step kids. You two need to have an open dialog about why he doesn\u2019t want her to go so badly. 3) if it\u2019s not option 2, you married a vengeful monster and exposed your kid to them.

I don\u2019t trust any man that would express his anger that way.

This is not how emotionally functional people behave.", "NTA. First off, a step parent should NEVER be in charge of discipline. That's the parent's job. Second, while I'm not saying your daughter behaved well, I question whether she messed up as badly as your husband feels she did. There's room for some nuance here. You say your daughter and her friends were smoking pot. Did she have a hit or was she stoned off her ass? If it's the former ...  the kids involved are 8 and 10. They don't need constant supervision. Do you and your husband ever have a glass of wine while the kids are awake? Is a toke off a joint so much different than that? As I said, there are some nuances here that your post doesn't address.", "And tbh... (and ppl please don't downvote me to hell lol), but at 17 she could've effed up way more. the kids are 10 and 8. not 2 and 5. She probably sat them to watch a movie and went outside for 15 mins to smoke a joint, I can't imagine she was out with her friends the entire time. I'd bet money the kids didn't even know she was gone. It's super irresponsible and she shouldn't be smoking weed. But is it really ALL THAT BAD? I don't really think so. Step dad is definitely just out for revenge.", "I don\u2019t know\u2026 it\u2019s hard to judge without knowing more info\u2026 based on past experience are grounding or taking away her phone taken as severe consequences, and for how long? If not, then T Swift may be the only way, but if so, then that may be appropriate.\n\nAlso, there are so many other things to consider. Inviting 3 friends over while babysitting is also not very responsible. And the fact that she got caught only because the husband came home 2 hours early indicates that she knew it was wrong (probably trying to be done before he comes home). Has she done this before while babysitting? Has she been caught smoking pot before? Is that an issue? Then, perhaps a more severe punishment is warranted. Does the husband have a contentious relationship with his ex? If so, this could be used as a way to take away some of his custody, which may be a source of stress for the husband. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to guess that the husband just wants revenge, you could also assume that OP just doesn\u2019t want to punish her daughter the way husband wants because OP is a T Swift fan and wants someone to go with her. \n\nI do think, though, that if OP decides to go to the concert with the daughter, she may be damaging her marriage.", "[deleted]", "Yep, that's my take.", "Bingo. This isn\u2019t him wanting to *discipline* his daughter, it\u2019s him wanting to *punish* his daughter. \n\nTaking the concert away is retribution, not rehabilitation/behavioral correction. NTA.", "Taking away her phone for a month will leave a much longer lasting impression honestly.", "I agree that the husband over-reacted but... on the other hand, it sounds like OP is far more concerned about missing the concert (with the daughter) than having the daughter faced consequences for screwing up so badly.  Where I am, pot is legal, but what if this happened in an area with laws against it?  The daughter not being allowed to go to a concert is appropriate (Sorry to all the swifties out there, but it is just a concert.  The world will keep turning if the daughter and OP can't go to this concert...) ESH from me... the father for screaming and ranting at his daughter, mother for caring more about a concert than allowing their daughter to face reasonable consequences, and the daughter for....screwing up royally.", "This, and also it seems like your husband isn\u2019t concerned with the safety and well being of his step-kid. \nScreaming at her so much she felt she had to lock herself in her room until you were home? Now she\u2019s afraid to be in her own home with him?", "Taking away the tickets is NOT a natural consequence. I agree on the revenge part.", "I'm curious what would a fitting punishment to this look like to you? I just am having a hard time in crossing the bridge to him seeking revenge, it kinda more feels like OP is seeking absolution for her daughter. Like a bunch of minor punishments were offered as examples in the body of the post but does any of that really feel like it's going to be a punishment or even phase the daughter when she knows she is going to be riding high at a Tswift show? I think he'd be out for blood if he is looking to get paid for the tickets but selling them and returning her money I think is pretty fair? In my mind if I was grounded for something I definitely wouldnt have been allowed to go out and do anything regardless if I paid for it or not and I definitely would be on my own for getting my money back.", "The anger at her irresponsibility may be justifiable (first basic reaction) but yeah he's hell bent on punishment to the point of giving the daughter and mum the silent treatment. What's he going to do when he doesn't het his way? Why the immature nuclear response? Why can't he sit down, lead by example and have a conversation with the teenage step daughter?\n\n\nMy aunt brought tickets for her step kid and me to Disney world florida, but mum made her cancel my ticket because I never behaved well enough apparently. That type of destructive parenting never ends well. \"My road or the high road\" That type of parent stops at nothing to correct what they see as bad behaviour. To the point my mum tried all sorts of things when me and my siblings were adults when we did something wrong.\n\n\nKids will do dumb sh!t. Not condoning what the daughter did, but how the parents react and respond sets the tone for how she learns to handle problems and conflicts in life.\n\n\nMy own mother also never let me forget my prior mistakes. It only drove a wedge (as did her other behavior) because I could never redeem myself in her eyes or be good enough.\n\n\nThe husbands reaction is telling and I'd be sitting down saying he learns to address his problems like an adult\nin a healthy manner instead of immaturely giving you both the silent treatment till he gets his way.", "Screaming in your daughters face until she has a breakdown is abuse. I grew up like that. After the first time, it was like a dam broke and that became our relationship. I was afraid of him, I cowered away from him.

There is no way her tolerance is very high to pot at her age unless she does this regularly. An adult is not going to be shit faced off of two beers. She very well could have been high in the sky and unable to care for the kids if something were to happen.", "This, I know I've done this with my husband and some friends, kids in the house adults outside, kids inside and outside. I agree there is something more to this OTT reaction.", "My husband rarely asks my daughter to watch his kids, but when he does ask her, he pays her.", "Holy shit I found the winner of the \u201clet\u2019s make him T A with no evidence and make up a bunch of shit that turns out to be wrong.\u201d", "The daughter was getting high when she was supposed to be responsible for watching over two young children. That's reason enough to be upset. Whether she was paid, or pressured, or any of that (which is unknown to us at this time) is a completely separate issue.", "Even if you are forced to babysit being petty by being irresponsible is not the answer", "Thats the real question right there!", "Yes, she apologized but my husband feels she only feels bad that she got caught.", "So much this.\n\nAlso parenting a teen is so much about the relationship. Teens are going to make mistakes, some of them will be really dumb. If you've established a careful relationship where they can talk to you when things go bad, then they've got a good safety net while their brain matures. If there scared of being yelled at like OPs husband did, that kid will never seek support from that parent again, and it fucks with the self image in a long term damaging way too.\n\nConsequences need to be directly related to the mistake. With this one the kids weren't well supervised, and the teen made a stupid decision with friends. Maybe they can't have friends over in the afternoons. Maybe they're required to be interactive with their step siblings for the next few weekends, really take on the responsibility. Maybe the parents sit down with the teen and look up the relevant laws and their common legal consequences. The goal is to deepen the teen's understanding of how to be a good adult, how to take responsibility seriously, to think beyond the immediate fun into what could go wrong.\n\nPunishment damages the relationship, and pretty soon the built relationship will be all there is. This kid will be an adult soon. She'll choose who she wants to spend time with based on enjoying their company and feeling safe and loved. They won't choose to spend time with a step dad who rages like this. So both parents in this picture need to think about what they want long term, what lesson do they actually need the kid to learn, and how are they going to meaningfully teach it. They need to think about whether they want their future adult child to seek them out, to keep drawing from that relationship and maintaining it collaboratively. They don't have much time left with her home.", "This is the most reasonable response imo. How many parents smoke weed or drink after their kids go to bed? \n\nShould she get in trouble? For sure!

Some real brain rot takes", "That's a really weird take on this. I think most parents would be nuclear if they paid someone to watch their kids, then that someone invited friends over to smoke pot without anyone keeping a single eye on the kids. \n\nThe issue is that if you agree to be responsible for kids, you shouldn't be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Now if she had gone outside to smoke and chill by herself, that would be one thing. I doubt the dad or anyone else would be nearly as mad. Still a bit irresponsible sure, but the friends is what gets me personally. \n\nShe was hanging out with friends outside smoking pot. There's absolutely no way she was paying attention to the kids.

Almost like you've overreacted, quite ironic given the topic at hand.", "I did say maybe.\n\nAnd in my house, I discipline more harshly for harsher offenses. If my son did something to endanger my daughter, there would be yelling. \n\nAnd it would be a different kind of yelling then the tone of voice I use for saying to \u201cpick up your shoes\u201d for the fourth time\u201d.", "mom cares......about going to see taylor swift.", "Plenty of people react poorly to yelling. That doesn't make it emotional abuse.", "Also a fair point on your end, I'm sure OP doesn't want to lose out on the experience of going to a big concert that both OP and her daughter would very much enjoy. I think there are other options besides taking away the concert, but there definitely has to be a big punishment for this. And I wouldn't fault them for taking away the concert as a punishment either. I voted N A H myself as I can see both sides to this.", "She wasn\u2019t driving. She was just out in the back yard. If there was an accident, either child could go get the 17 year old. Either child is capable of calling 9-1-1. \n\nI really can\u2019t relate to all the angry people on here. My parents started leaving me home alone to watch my brother when I was 10 and he was 7. No teenager babysitter was ever needed.", "I mean, if he didn't feel like there were adequate consequences last time and she didn't learn her lesson then why did he make her responsible for his kids?", "That is how punishment works. Daughter did something that put her siblings at actual risk of harm. Only something of this magnitude is going to work on her.", "Dude. YOU CANNOT PAY A 17 YEAR OLD CHILD TO BE A RESPONSIBLE ADULT. You can also not pay a llama to be a dolphin. No matter how rich you are. No matter if the llama accepts the money. Bad llama \ud83e\udd99 \n\nThis isn\u2019t a back and forth conversation for you to argue with. It\u2019s a fact. Lol.\n\nAnd you say no, but the answer to my question is yes? Your version of appropriate use is only medical? \ud83d\ude44", "They said \u201chealthy\u201d parents. Many, many humans are not from unhealthy backgrounds, never unpack it, and have kids anyway. The cycle repeats. \n\nLashing out like this isn\u2019t healthy and what OP\u2019s husband did is NOT the equivalent of yelling to stop a child from touching the stove. Clearly you relate to the stepdad and that\u2019s fine. But that does not mean his reaction was appropriate, and his fears do *not* mean his children were actually in danger.", "Shouting at a kid because they're about to injure themselves is absolutely not the same as angrily shouting at them for several minutes to the point that the kid is sobbing in their bedroom.", "If the husbands feel like his wife is minimizing the consequence because she will not give in to what he wants without compromise (when said consequence also heavily hurts/impacts her), that's something he needs to work. You are not always going to get your way and compromise is necessary. If you are 100% unwilling to compromise, that isn't an issue with the other person not taking things seriously enough.\n\n>Her daughter broke husband\u2019s trust. It will take time to earn that back but she should be given the opportunity.\n\nOP stated in a comment her husband has already stated to her that this is permanent damage. Her husband is unwilling to give her the opportunity to fix this. It's not about fixing it or her learning a lesson, he wants to hurt her.", "Well then why can\u2019t he actually be an adult and communicate that instead of resorting to dismissive behavior and stonewalling?", "don't bother. everything is abuse to the fragile clowns on this subreddit", "have kids. one in college, one in high school. I didn't say I never yelled. I've not claimed perfection. I have regrets a plenty.  What I am is mature and self aware to recognize that I have made mistakes and I now know better and I have apologized and asked for forgiveness because I love them enough to want them to know that I want to be the Dad they deserve.\n\nAnd it's not hyperbole.  It's abuse.  Sorry if that stings.  But that's a fact. This article might help..

Yet he\u2019s only choosing the one that does.", "Well actually in some places you maybe can. \n\n\u201cNo, there is no legal age for babysitting. It is the responsibility of the parents using common sense to make the decision. It is worth bearing in mind though that a child under 16 years old cannot be prosecuted for neglect or ill treatment of children in their care. The parents/carers/guardians would be charged in that situation. However, any person who is 16 or over and who has responsibility for a person under that age could be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nBut then again, the parents would probably be at fault too.\n\nAnd no, I understand weed can be recreational. Personally, I don\u2019t have an issue with that as long as no one else is getting hurt. It is not my cup of tea for other reasons but I won\u2019t judge anyone that feels otherwise.", "At 16 you can be a life guard so I think at 17 you can be paid to not smoke and watch kids", "I never said it was appropriate, k said it was understandable. He needs to work on his anger. But OP\u2019s daughter is so far in the wrong. Punishments haven\u2019t worked on her before. She had to go to the ER to get her stomach pumped. She doesn\u2019t learn.", "Fair. They both need to sit down and have a calm, rational discussion and move forward as a parenting team. Blended families are difficult at the best of times.", "So I read the article. Found a few interesting points in there, such as:\n\n>But yelling can also be used as a tool, one that lets parents release a little steam and, sometimes, gets kids to listen.  \n>  \n>Was there a clear cause-and-effect as to why they get so upset?  \n>  \n>Naumburg said nearly all typical, reasonably good enough parents will have toxic explosions once in awhile. And as long as they are once-in-awhile, they can actually be useful.", "the idea that it's a once in a lifetime event sounds like bs to me cause it's not like they got lucky and bought the tickets when they were cheap.  if they can pay extra now they could do it again later.  that's how i see it but i also don't particularly give a shit about the daughter smoking pot, it's doing it with 2 kids under 10 around that upsets me.", "It quite literally doesn't.", "This isn\u2019t the first time the daughter has had an issue with substance abuse. OP is completely omitting things that would prove she\u2019s the AH."]}
