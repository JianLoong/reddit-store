When your bf interrupts you he's basically saying that what he has to say is so much more important than what you have to say, that he's not going to let you finish. \n\nThen when you *keep* talking he accuses you of the same?

As an adhd\u2019er myaelf, sometimes you really can\u2019t control it. That isn\u2019t an excuse. We all have the ability to control our tongues and have the respect to let others finish. He needs to work on that. When he interrupts, kindly tell him \u201cI\u2019m not finished yet\u201d and then continue. When you are done talking, \u201cok, now what were you trying to say?\u201d If he doesn\u2019t know, it wasn\u2019t important and you can use that as an example to help him understand he is being disrespectful to you", "NTA\n\nYou've tried addressing it in other ways and have not made headway in this issue.

Most of the time I can be patient & tell him I wasn't finished or whatever. But sometimes I just stop talking with an annoyed look on my face until he realizes he interrupted me. He always feels like a jerk & apologizes. I can tell it hurts his feelings a bit when I do that, but he also understands I can only be cut off so many times before I get a little snippy about it. I have thought about interrupting him to \"show him how it feels\" but he's not doing it to be malicious, he's just really excited to talk to me, so I don't feel like it would be healthy to do it back. He's kind of like a golden retriever that way. Which in my opinion is mostly charming. Sometimes annoying. But at the end of the day I reach the same conclusion, every time. I can't be mad at a golden retriever who's obsessed with their person. \ud83d\udc96", "NTA whatsoever.  His behavior is boorish and needs to be stopped.", "NAH\n\nYou have every right to feel unheard, but at the same time your partner sounds like he might simply have some form of neurodivergent shenanigans like ADHD, interrupting people with your immediate thought is a pretty common symptom. If you think he's doing it on purpose to be an AH then maybe he's not the person you should be with, otherwise it might be worth him speaking to a doctor/therapist and getting some tools to help him manage those impulses better.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is really an AH here. My boyfriend and I have similar issues, tho I am the constant interrupter (even tho he does it a lot as well). I think you need to have a serious conversation about communication habits and expectations or it\u2019s only going to cause resentment. \n\nIt also depends - do you think he\u2019s the one? If not, don\u2019t stress about it and move on with your life. If you think you can see yourself marrying them, you need to \u201cput in the work\u201d in a sense. No one is perfect and people communicate very differently. Working on this now will save you so much time and headaches in the future. \n\nIm from an extremely large New York Italian family and everyone talks over eachother and interrupts, if you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t get heard. People have different backgrounds and were raised with different communication \u201cnorms\u201d if you will. \n\nSo I\u2019m having to relearn proper communication, which has been a struggle at times but my partner has been great about letting me know when I\u2019m being a bit rude even though I\u2019m not purposefully doing it. \n\nBeing petty about it will get you no where, you are both in the relationship and have a right to be heard and understood.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It makes him feel like you don't care what he has to say?\n\nWhen he says this, it's now on you to use your communication skills and say, \"well, that's how I feel when you interrupt me.\" And pray that he gets it. \n\nMy husband does the same damn thing and let me tell you it is a STRUGGLE. But disengaging from the conversation when he interrupts me is the only thing I've found that draws his attention to the fact that he's even doing it - but you HAVE to follow up with clear communication. When he stops talking, you have to tell him that he did it again and you don't appreciate it. If you do that, NTA.", "NTA-this is a pet peeve of mine as well. However, I have been around a couple people that talk non-stop and the only way I get a word in....is to interrupt them. I'm not saying that's the case here, but this post made me think of that.", "NTA but I don't think you are compatible", "NTA. I learned my interrupting habit from my mom. My husband pointed it out and it has taken some work to get through. I didn\u2019t realize it was a problem as I was afraid whatever I was going to say I would forget or it would no longer be relevant if I didn\u2019t say it right that second. I would tell your boyfriend that you ARE interested in what he has to say but what he has to say needs to be said when there is a natura break in what YOU are saying. When he interrupts he is having a one sided conversation not you. It is possible he doesn\u2019t understand the extent to which he does this. It really wasn\u2019t something I saw until I had a conversation with a few people and my husband squeezed my arm every time I attempted to interject and I was able to see that what I expected to be the end of a sentence or end of a thought wasn\u2019t actually that. I was trying to predict the conversation so I could be next to tak but instead had failed to listen. I think you can help him with this by continually pointing it out. Maybe when he interrupts hold up a hand and state \u2018I wasn\u2019t done, hold on\u2019 and continue. When done be very clear and say \u2018what did you want to add?\u2019  It seems ridiculous but perhaps he needs to be walked through this with his hand held. But I also understand if that\u2019s too much work. Just giving you what might be his perspective", "I was once like your boyfriend when I was a young man.  I think I was insecure and felt the \"need\" to show how smart I was.   At one point, while sitting in a work teaching session I heard - if you are interrupting someone, you can't be actively listening to them. Somehow - hearing that worked for me. I tended to do this at work -  though I did it in my personal life if I was out drinking.  \n\nI'd recommend you ask why he interupts- does he not respect your thoughts? Does he need to feel important or prove he's smarter? \nThen tell him that if he interrupts, he's busy forming his statement at the same time you're talking.  Meaning - he's not listening.", "NTA my grandma does this all the time. I have got to the point I don\u2019t let her cut me off I just say \u201clet me finish\u201d. She hates it but the more I do it the more she has learnt not to cut people off because my sis and mum have started to do the same", "Aww poor guy, such a shame that the middle of your sentence interrupted the beginning of his. /s\n\nNTA, that would annoy me to no end as well.", "NTA. I interrupt too much too. Too over excited. Brain works too fast. It's annoying and I wish I didn't. He might not be able to stop interrupting, but he should stop when he's called on it.", "NTA.  Been there, done that.  Sometimes I've taken the dirty tactic of returning the favour.  Other times, I've continued speaking as if I didn't hear their voice when they interrupted me mid-sentence.  Other times I will say loudly, \"Sorry, was my sentence too long for you to wait your turn?\"  Other times, I will go silent and walk away.  Can't honestly say any of these was effective, except the walk away.", "NTA - but I would try a couple of other things on him as well:\n\n1) When he interrupts the first time in a conversation - Say LOUDLY  STOP!  Then ask him to repeat what you had just said.  If he can do it, allow him to make his interruption.  If he can not, start from the beginning and repeat what you were telling him and ignore what he says, but restart again from the beginning. For any other interruption after the first , ignore and restart.\n\n2) Get a dollar store bejeweled fancy Pen and call it the Talking Pen.  Hold it up while you are talking to him.  When he interrupts say in your BEST kindergarten voice:\n\n\"Who has the talking pen?  Do you have the talking pen?  No, No you do not.  What do you do when you don't have the talking pen?  That's right you LISTEN.   Is interrupting listening?  No, No it is not.   Let's try that again.\"  Start from the beginning.   If he is going to commmunicate like a preschooler, treat him like a preschooler.\n\n3) Cat training style - have a squirt bottle full of water with you.  When he interrupts squirt him with water in the face and say \"BAD BF BAD! NO Interrupting\" then continue.  Repeat as necessary.\n\n4) Tell him that everything he interrupts you, he must put a dollar in the Interrupting Jar.  Keep it handy, and every time he interrupts you, goo \"DOLLAR DOLLAR DOLLAR\" and make him put it in right then and there.  Make sure you can make change for him.  Also make sure you are the only one who can take money out of the jar.\n\nThe idea behind all of these is to 1) Make him aware at the time of the interruption that he is in fact interrupting you. and 2)  Make it clear this is unacceptable behaviour and there will  be consequences.  If it is just a bad habit,  and he cares about improving you will know quickly.  If he just only cares about what he wants to say, you will know that too, and can make any other decisions with that in mind.", "> he said that it feels like i don\u2019t have any interest in what he\u2019s saying and it hurts him when i don\u2019t contribute and feels like he\u2019s having a one-sided conversation\n\nWow! Imagine how it must feel for *you* to have every sentence interrupted by *him* because he can't wait his turn to talk! NTA, but it sounds like your communication is a big problem. He needs to show a willingness to change **now**.", "This, I'm ADD and even though I know it's wrong to interrupt, in the moment I can't control myself.", "Did you know that even if you do something on accident, that it can still hurt the people you love?", "Saaammmmee!", "Of course it still hurts that's why I didn't call OP an AH either, her feelings are perfectly valid, I just don't agree that he's an AH because his family never noticed or got him support so now he's showing incredibly common behaviour of someone who's neurodivergent. Hence the NAH.\n\nIt's a crappy situation, but not every crappy situation needs someone to be in the wrong. He needs to learn methods to control his impulses since he was never given the support to learn how to growing up clearly, and OP gets to decide if she wants to stick around for that or not.", "Lol my husband gets so mad, I really have put a ton of work into not interrupting but if I don't say it I'll forget it, and it's almost always about his story. Omg he tells such loooooooong stories", "Is it rude to jot down notes so we can remember what we wanted to add to the convo?", "Yes!!!!!! We forget because our minds are always going in a thousand different directions."]}
