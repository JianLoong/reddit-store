I have thought about interrupting him to \"show him how it feels\" but he's not doing it to be malicious, he's just really excited to talk to me, so I don't feel like it would be healthy to do it back.

But disengaging from the conversation when he interrupts me is the only thing I've found that draws his attention to the fact that he's even doing it - but you HAVE to follow up with clear communication.

My husband pointed it out and it has taken some work to get through. I didn\u2019t realize it was a problem as I was afraid whatever I was going to say I would forget or it would no longer be relevant if I didn\u2019t say it right that second. I would tell your boyfriend that you ARE interested in what he has to say but what he has to say needs to be said when there is a natura break in what YOU are saying. When he interrupts he is having a one sided conversation not you. It is possible he doesn\u2019t understand the extent to which he does this. It really wasn\u2019t something I saw until I had a conversation with a few people and my husband squeezed my arm every time I attempted to interject and I was able to see that what I expected to be the end of a sentence or end of a thought wasn\u2019t actually that. I was trying to predict the conversation so I could be next to tak but instead had failed to listen. I think you can help him with this by continually pointing it out. Maybe when he interrupts hold up a hand and state \u2018I wasn\u2019t done, hold on\u2019 and continue. When done be very clear and say \u2018what did you want to add?\u2019  It seems ridiculous but perhaps he needs to be walked through this with his hand held. But I also understand if that\u2019s too much work. Just giving you what might be his perspective", "I was once like your boyfriend when I was a young man.  I think I was insecure and felt the \"need\" to show how smart I was.   At one point, while sitting in a work teaching session I heard - if you are interrupting someone, you can't be actively listening to them. Somehow - hearing that worked for me. I tended to do this at work -  though I did it in my personal life if I was out drinking.  \n\nI'd recommend you ask why he interupts- does he not respect your thoughts? Does he need to feel important or prove he's smarter? \nThen tell him that if he interrupts, he's busy forming his statement at the same time you're talking.  Meaning - he's not listening.", "NTA my grandma does this all the time. I have got to the point I don\u2019t let her cut me off I just say \u201clet me finish\u201d.

I interrupt too much too. Too over excited. Brain works too fast. It's annoying and I wish I didn't. He might not be able to stop interrupting, but he should stop when he's called on it.", "NTA.  Been there, done that.  Sometimes I've taken the dirty tactic of returning the favour.  Other times, I've continued speaking as if I didn't hear their voice when they interrupted me mid-sentence.  Other times I will say loudly, \"Sorry, was my sentence too long for you to wait your turn?\"  Other times, I will go silent and walk away.  Can't honestly say any of these was effective, except the walk away.", "NTA - but I would try a couple of other things on him as well:\n\n1) When he interrupts the first time in a conversation - Say LOUDLY  STOP!  Then ask him to repeat what you had just said.  If he can do it, allow him to make his interruption.  If he can not, start from the beginning and repeat what you were telling him and ignore what he says, but restart again from the beginning. For any other interruption after the first , ignore and restart.\n\n2) Get a dollar store bejeweled fancy Pen and call it the Talking Pen.  Hold it up while you are talking to him.  When he interrupts say in your BEST kindergarten voice:\n\n\"Who has the talking pen?  Do you have the talking pen?  No, No you do not.  What do you do when you don't have the talking pen?  That's right you LISTEN.   Is interrupting listening?  No, No it is not.   Let's try that again.\"  Start from the beginning.   If he is going to commmunicate like a preschooler, treat him like a preschooler.\n\n3) Cat training style - have a squirt bottle full of water with you.  When he interrupts squirt him with water in the face and say \"BAD BF BAD! NO Interrupting\" then continue.  Repeat as necessary.\n\n4) Tell him that everything he interrupts you, he must put a dollar in the Interrupting Jar.  Keep it handy, and every time he interrupts you, goo \"DOLLAR DOLLAR DOLLAR\" and make him put it in right then and there.  Make sure you can make change for him.  Also make sure you are the only one who can take money out of the jar.\n\nThe idea behind all of these is to 1) Make him aware at the time of the interruption that he is in fact interrupting you. and 2)  Make it clear this is unacceptable behaviour and there will  be consequences.  If it is just a bad habit,  and he cares about improving you will know quickly.  If he just only cares about what he wants to say, you will know that too, and can make any other decisions with that in mind.", "> he said that it feels like i don\u2019t have any interest in what he\u2019s saying and it hurts him when i don\u2019t contribute and feels like he\u2019s having a one-sided conversation\n\nWow! Imagine how it must feel for *you* to have every sentence interrupted by *him* because he can't wait his turn to talk! NTA, but it sounds like your communication is a big problem. He needs to show a willingness to change **now**.", "This, I'm ADD and even though I know it's wrong to interrupt, in the moment I can't control myself.", "Did you know that even if you do something on accident, that it can still hurt the people you love?", "Saaammmmee!", "Of course it still hurts that's why I didn't call OP an AH either, her feelings are perfectly valid, I just don't agree that he's an AH because his family never noticed or got him support so now he's showing incredibly common behaviour of someone who's neurodivergent. Hence the NAH.\n\nIt's a crappy situation, but not every crappy situation needs someone to be in the wrong. He needs to learn methods to control his impulses since he was never given the support to learn how to growing up clearly, and OP gets to decide if she wants to stick around for that or not.", "Lol my husband gets so mad, I really have put a ton of work into not interrupting but if I don't say it I'll forget it, and it's almost always about his story.
