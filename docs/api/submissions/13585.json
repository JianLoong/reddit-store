Not even a guest the bride has nerve.", "NTA. Just politely decline or make up an excuse about being busy and leave it at that.", "NTA. I don't profess to know anything about Indian culture so I can't judge by that. But it seems very strange for someone to expect people who aren't even invited to the wedding to throw a party to celebrate them.", "NTA. If you're not in or invited to the wedding you shouldn't be expected to put jn the work or foot the bill for her party.", "NTA if you're good friends, good enough to throw a party for her, then you're good enough to invite. Conversely, if you're not good enough to invite, you're not good enough to throw her a party. It's remarkably entitled for her to even expect it.", "NTA - Regardless of differing cultures, your \"friend\" is being incredibly entitled to expect people to go to the trouble and expense of planning a party for her when she can't even bother to invite them to any of the multiple festivities that will be going on, especially the ones that are close to them.  This smells like pure greed and I honestly would just say that you are busy and don't have the time, if you even respond further on the topic at all.  Some levels of rudeness deserve to simply be ignored.", "NTA you can easily send her a message back and say that you aren\u2019t able to plan a bachelorette party for her. Personally, I would point out that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with being asked to put in that kind of effort when I hadn\u2019t even been invited as a guest. You know one of those pre wedding parties is often a ladies party where she has her henna done with her friends and female relatives? You weren\u2019t even invited to that! She has no right to ask this if you.", "This is the maid of honors duties", "NTA but Savvanah was mean.", "Info - did the bride originally ask you to organize a bachelorette party for her and you said yes?  If so, when did this conversation happen in the timeline, before she told you that you wouldn't be invited to anything?", "NTA You even get an invite to the wedding but the bride expects you to organize her bachelorette party?

Yeah, those are not throw a bachelorette party friendships.", "NTA. The bride sounds delusional and oblivious to her own  sense of entitlement. You mentioned in a comment her old friends all ghosted her for some reason, and if this is her typical mindset I can't say it's surprising.", "NTA.

If so, why wouldn't her friends throw her a bachelorette?\n\nThe wedding could be very small, there could be parental politics involved (likely), or there could be other reasons for why you and her other friends didn't get an invitation.

All you have to say is you aren\u2019t available to plan a party for her. If she truly were a friend, she would have included you in one of the pre-wedding functions in your hometown.

Not always even people you know.\n\nNot inviting friends is *weird*. Though, that's my understanding--different culture.", "From Indian family - yes it is. If I had to do this due to $$ or family politics, I would explain it to my friends because by our standards, it is very unusual and could be considered an insult. I\u2019m guessing here that she is leaving out her non-Indian friends but didn\u2019t bother to tell them that\u2019s why.", "Yes. Because it is weird. Next question?", "If you want to take the middle road, consider to take her out for a simple brunch or hold a potluck at your house. Each person can bring cookies, mini sandwiches, fruit salad etc and it wouldn\u2019t cost much time or energy. I wouldn\u2019t make a big deal about decorations or anything, just a simple, inexpensive, and low key gathering. If she has the audacity to complain, then express surprise and confusion that a traditional bachelorette isn\u2019t being held by friends and family part of the wedding. Of course, you can confront her too but I think acting oblivious and doing something small gives you the moral upper hand if you have any interest in continuing this relationship.

At this point I'm wondering: did she specifically say none of you are invited, or is it just that she hasn't actually extended an invitation? I ask because it's entirely likely that she straight up forgot to invite you all lol so she'll be in for a surprise when none do her friends show up to her parties.", "Ah ty for the enlightenment", "And you assumed you'd be invited even if you couldn't attend.

If OP is not in the top 300-400 of bride and groom\u2019s loved ones she shouldn\u2019t be expected to organize a bachelorette for bride", "She's not inviting a single friend, even Indian friends are not invited. We are her only friends.", "All of our other friends are offended so nope we cannot have any gatherings. The most I can do and I'm planning to do it to take her out on lunch one last time before her wedding. \n\nShe's moving to an entirely new town after her marriage.

We might not be able to make it on such short notice.\" Obviously after congratulating her. That's it! There was no other conversation regarding the wedding in the group chat.  \nShe has called me several times ranting about how tedious it is to organise an Indian wedding. Some days, she even cried on the call because of all the stress, but she never once mentioned anything about inviting us to any of the events.  \nAt one point, I thought maybe she thinks it's self-explanatory that we all are invited and she doesn't have to do it explicitly. But she hasn't even given us the venue or dates for any event.", "AFAIK, it's not even wedding season here lol.", "And that\u2019s why I said *almost* :) \n\nThough in all seriousness, point taken, and I should probably have qualified that my comment was about weddings in the Indian diaspora rather than in India itself - where I expect there would be much greater variation. \n\nMy experience of weddings in the diaspora in three countries now is that even when they\u2019re comparatively small they\u2019ve been large by western standards. - so on the balance of probabilities I\u2019m pretty sure this was going to be a big wedding, especially since OP mentioned several days of events.", "Yeah, but I bet there are relatives and the kids of family friends who were invited, that\u2019s what I mean when I say Indian friends. So for me - I had my school friends who weren\u2019t Indian. But in the community, you are expected to treat your Indian peers like friends at the social gatherings. So her mom\u2019s friend\u2019s daughters? That\u2019s the kind of person in her age group I am thinking they would not have excluded even if I never hung out with them of my own choice", "Yeah I would probably just have a frank conversation with her on whether or not you all are invited. It's entirely possible that she is so stressed out that she just forgot to send you invites. Or she's just incredibly dense.", "I mean it might be cheaper to host indian weddings off season given all the costs lol.", "Having been to over a dozen Indian weddings, I've seen ones that had more than 500 people. \n\n\nAnd ones that had less than 20.", "I get it! \n\nI guess those people are invited", "True.", "I\u2019ve been to a few dozen too - and I think the smallest traditional one I attended was about 250. \n\nI mention traditional because OP mentioned several days of events - which lines up with a traditional wedding. \n\nBut yes I imagine even in the diaspora there are small traditional weddings which is why my statement wasn\u2019t an absolute."]}
