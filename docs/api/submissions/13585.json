People will save money for years only to spend it all on a day on a bunch of people and then spend the rest of their lives recovering from the debt. It used to be a great thing since Indian culture is deeply rooted in community ties and large families but nowadays it's more of a competition and showing off when you don't even have the means to it. \n\nSmall weddings are so rare,it becomes news when ppl do that,here a celeb having a small wedding and donating the money they could have wasted on a lavish wedding to charity was such a big deal a few years ago.", "Oh not literally you, I mean in general. Why would she expect her friends to plan a special wedding event to a wedding they\u2019re not invited to.", "If I had to assume:\n\n\nOP says she wouldn't have been able to attend the wedding anyways, so perhaps OP's friend thought they could celebrate the bridal shower together.", "That doesn\u2019t fly to me as a good excuse for the bride, even if it was true. She could have asked \u201cdo you think you\u2019d be able to come?\u201d \u2026and if the answer was \u201cno,\u201d the friends would likely have reacted differently to a bachelorette party, in fact may have felt *more* than willing to have one.", "Fair enough. \n\n\nI've seen Indian weddings and the planning can be hectic, so maybe it's a genuine mistake.\n\n\nOr maybe OP's friend is super entitles.\n\n\nHard to tell from a single post", "Go have a night out with your friends, 'forget' to invite the bride, complain to her that she didn't even show up to the Bachelorette Party. Do these things and then you can be the asshole", "NTA\n\nShe is basically saying...the only function YOU can attend is the one YOU orchestrate. \n\nYou are giving this nonfriend waaaay too much energy. \n\nTell her no so she retaliate by not inviting you to anything....wait....she's already done that.", "How much planning do you need? Get a tiara, white \"I'm the bride\" t-shirt and pick a place with lots of bars and dancing. Get a hotel room. Done.", "So dramatic. Nta. Don't organize it.", "I think it\u2019s important to explain that it\u2019s not just an issue of you all being busy. If that\u2019s the reason, you\u2019ll be the \u201cbad guys\u201d for not making time for your friend before her wedding. If you explain that you weren\u2019t invited and traditionally the close female guests and bridesmaids throw the party, that puts the onus on her. Her not bothering to invite you all is the reason, not because you guys refuse to make the time for her. NTA.", "As a south Indian, I've been raised to believe that i would be a massive asshole if i didn't invite 700 people i don't even know to my wedding lmao. In my family at least you need to invite EVERYONE in the town and then some or it's an insult.", "It really sounds like there's some family politics or something very odd going on, and probably not good.  If you're her only friends, is there maybe a gentle way of checking if everything is ok?", "I dont wanna impose and i dont know any of you and will be probably wrong. Maybe her family/fiance family dont allow her to invite her friends and basically took over her whole wedding maybe even forcing the wedding on her. If i were you i would talk to her on the phone if shes pressured/forced into the marriage and possibly rescue her, maybe that was a call for help.", "I'm not saying that you must have a small wedding, I'm just pointing out that not every Indian wedding is huge and has 100+ guests.\n\n\nGuess reddit didn't like my opinion, going by the downvotes", "it really depends on the nature of the previous conversation. if op and friends already said they couldn\u2019t make it i\u2019m not sure why an invite would be sent if they already declined? when we sent save the dates a few people told us they wouldn\u2019t be attending so we didn\u2019t send them invites.. since they already responded?", "Your friend is being kind of a jerk by not inviting you to the local events. My parents are from India and I've been to many Indian weddings. People have always invited their non-indian friends to a variety of functions. Assuming that none of the events are hosted at a friend of a friend's house, which in that case it's kind of hard to invite extra people to somebody else's house. But if the events are being held at the hall or at the girls' own house then that's on her to invite you.", "Nta. \n\nThat is traditionally the responsibility of the maid of honor. You are not even a guest. Don\u2019t assume that responsibility. Bachelorette parties take a lot of planning and MONEY! The bride does not pay, the group splits her portion. It sounds like you don\u2019t really even know her well enough to plan something she would like.", "Wait what. She wants you to go out of your way to plan some party and you\u2019re not even in the wedding? Or attending? Hell no. NTA.", "haha, loved the energy of this comment!", "She wants us to organize it for her. We were not even thinking about throwing a party for her but yesterday she called me and asked me explicitly to organize one for her.", "Yeah, pass if you're not even invited to it.  It's unclear why you consider her to be a friend of yours.", "> And if they harbored ill will to me, I also find it hard to understand how they could ask you to plan the Bach with a straight face\n\nI'm quite sure she has no ill intentions towards us, she's probably dense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I don't want to make this a culture thing because maybe you all are Indian or some of you, but maybe if you aren't Indian she didn't invite you guys for that reason\n\ntwo things\n\n1. one of our Indian friends got married last month and she didn't exclude us from any of the events. We were invited in all of them irrespective of our religion. From this experience, I believe Indians love to invite people and share the happiness and culture with others as well.\n2. Even the Indian friends are not invited in Savvanah's wedding and other events.\n\n>If you can, update us!\n\nSure, will probably meet her tomorrow!", "I have already talked with her on this. The day she informed us she was getting engaged, I called her. She seemed happy, all giggly and showing off (not in a bad way) her engagement dress. Even after her engagement, we have had this conversation a couple of times and every time she assured that she's happy with this marriage.", "NTA don\u2019t do it. Tell her the truth, she can ask the people she did invite to organise it.", "You're not supposed to invite people to pre-wedding events if they're not invited to the wedding so why would you rely on them for your Bachelorette?\n\nIf the reason she didn't invite you to the wedding is she thinks you're too busy, there's no reason to think you have time for the Bachelorette.\n\nI think she's using you. Indian weddings are big.", "Update me!", "Don't bother. You're not good enough to invite to the wedding so she shouldn't expect you to host a party for her. \n\nIf she had actually invited you, taking her to lunch if you couldn't attend makes sense but not when she didn't invite you", "No no, I'm not arguing with you I'm just giving my experience with these weddings. Sorry if I came across that way! I agree that a lot of people nowadays prefer small weddings, my sister and I are like that too."]}
