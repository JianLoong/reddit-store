It doesn't actually matter what OP's experience is, as long as her mom can look at herself positively.", "Then parents should be honest about the fear, pick her up, mom holds baby while dad and OP meet cops to get things and don\u2019t mention where OP & baby are staying so she can get what she needs.  Cops would help ensure if a confrontation then the right people are arrested and usually mention this option if you call the non emergency number plus ask if they will.

They broke up, reached out and we picked up as if we'd only seen each other yesterday, it's the litmus of a good relationship. Good luck and lots of blessings, my dear.
