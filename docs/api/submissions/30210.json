You\u2019re basically assuming her situation was exactly like yours and that she is exactly like you and you\u2019re using that to draw a conclusion which is basically pure ignorance lol", "You being able too or not changes nothing.  They are not required to care for you past adult age.  This is best case thinking.  Op is an ah she holds responsibility more than her parents.  They have none.", "And if OP has repeatedly told her mother that she has no clothes, the baby has no clothes, they have no money, no necessities, nothing, why are her parents not stepping in to buy those things for her? \"Anything to help\" but they can't take her shopping or drop off some diapers? They've left their daughter at a shelter with absolutely nothing! Okay, maybe OP couldn't move in with them for whatever reason, but that means they haven't given her a place to stay, they're not willing to go get her things, they're not giving her any money or purchasing anything she needs - what exactly *are* they doing? \n\nWhen you're at your third cousin's funeral and tell their family \"Please let us know if you need anything\" it's generally accepted that this is just an empty platitude. When you're telling your *daughter* \"Anything you need\" you should be prepared to at least make an effort.", "You're not helping anyone being a complete asshole to a sodv victim.  That's a new mom at that! Gtfoh with your reasoning. Crying the police will help. No they most likely won't. As someone that was thrown down 2 flights of steps in front of my 2 year old who cried to the cop that her daddy hurt her mommy they did nothing. He got a 200 fine. So get the fuck off her for not going to the police AS A LOT OF WOMAN DONT GO TO THE POLICE BC ITS pointless.", "Like, duh?

I was 23 with a 5 week old baby (that I almost died 2 X having.)  I called my mom they came and got me and baby.  Next day my dad, Sis and bil, bro and sil took off work and got me out in a couple of hours. All the furniture, kitchen stuff, etc. were mine before marriage.  They already had a storage unit set up.  Ex showed up during (he too was intimidated by dad) first thing he did was get the gun out of my nightstand, tucked it into his belt and strut around.  He didn\u2019t know dad had emptied it and had the bullets in his pocket.  Shoulda seen the look on his face when dad gave them back when we left!", "[deleted]", "At the moment I'm in a protected shelter, which is my safest option and I'm not ready to leave"]}
