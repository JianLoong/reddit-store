Good luck, op.", "\"so I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m being met with so much push back from husband and child.\"\n\nI'm conjecturing a lot here, so feel free to tell me I'm off base.\n\nBut I wonder if your husband wants to be the \"fun parent\" especially as his daughter's probably going to be showing a bit more attitude so he wants to get in her good graces early (pre-teenagers, gotta love 'em).\n\nBut if her mom is okay with the rules, he should be to. As to those who say you shouldn't be laying down the rules, it should be your husband?\n\nIt's your house too. And, as I said, you've talked to her mom so it's not like you're being dragon-stepmom and trying to take over your SD's life.\n\nWhat you've laid out are pretty basic and not harsh, imo.\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA I'm sorry but we shouldn't be encouraging children to be hermits , allowing her to have freedom and alone time is one thing and that's normal but what's an 11 year old doing up past 11pm anyway?. Also if your stepdaughters mother doesn't have a problem with the rules it just sounds like your husband is playing 'nice parent'.", "NTA - Especially since you spoke with mom. She is trying to push your boundaries. Stay strong and have dad help out.", "INFO: did you and your husband not talk about expectations beforehand?", "NTA. From all the comments, OP:\n\nDiscussed these expectations with her husband beforehand. He initially agreed.\n\nDouble-checked with SD's mom, who has primary custody. These are the same rules and expectations as at her house.\n\nHusband changed his tune the moment SD threw a tantrum in a clear (and successful) tactic to manipulate her father.\n\nOP is NTA for being a cooperative co-parent, or for trying to hold her husband to an agreement, or for enforcing some very basic rules and expectations in her house. Her husband needs to step up and be a parent, not his kid's friend.", "NTA for enforcing consistency between homes, it will greatly benefit her in the long run. The fact that your spouse is not having your back in this instance is worrying.\n\nIf the child sees that her behavior gets a positive reaction from an adult it will reinforce that behavior in her. She could interpret her dad disagreeing with you as a way to make the time she spends at your home free-reign.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke with her mom and are keeping the rules consistent. I seriously cannot understand all the Y T A votes here who think you should send the child back to her mom after a week of not having brushed her teeth or taken a shower. Gross. None of these rules are extreme or unreasonable. If Dad is unwilling to enforce the same rules she has every day in Mom's house and won't even expect his 11 y.o. to brush her teeth (eyeroll), Dad is the problem.", "INFO: Does the child consider you a parent or just dad's new wife?", "NTA None of the rules are unreasonable and you've discussed these with her Primary Carer who seems fine with it, as well as confirming the daughter has similar rules at her Mom's home.\n\nI don't see why your Husband objects to these given the above.", "NTA since the rules are the ones she has with the primary parent, were created by and in agreement with your husband and his ex, and the only reason your husband is changing his mind is age appropriate minimal pushback by his daughter.\n\nHowever, if that\u2019s the case what you have isn\u2019t an issue of rules, it\u2019s an issue with your husband\u2019s parenting. His lack of consistency and follow through are going to hurt his daughter in the long run and there\u2019s only so much you can do to minimize that as a stepparent.\n\nYou can continue to help him realize the importance healthy rules and boundaries (as well as meaning what he says) or you can accept he won\u2019t change. If the latter, think carefully if this is something you can live with.", "NTA those don\u2019t seem unreasonable to me. Especially if her mother is in agreement and the husband is too until the daughter comes around. You need to have a long conversation with him about undermining you and forcing you to be the \u201cbad\u201d cop. Eleven is still incredibly young as a gen z who grew up with unlimited electronic access I definitely will be doing something similar in terms of electronics at night. Also, 11pm is pretty late for an 11 year old I think. Maybe for summer try compromising and pushing the times back an hour or two if husband wants to be mister fun times. Consistency is important for kids and if those are the rules at moms house as well it\u2019d make sense for them to transfer over. I think a lot of the yta ppl think these are rules you are setting on your own despite you stating you made these with the bio mother and father. Dads fs the AH for putting you and BM in that situation to be the villain", "NTA, they\u2019re pretty similar to our summer rules. Except we have less screen time, no TVs in bedrooms, daily chores but no wake up time.\n\nIs there a specific issue she has? Maybe a place where you can discuss and compromise?", "NTA\n\nThat seems like excessive screen time and late nights for an 11 year old, frankly.", "NTA rules are important.", "NTA. As someone with strict parents, those are some generous rules. I don\u2019t know what you expect the kid to do for the 12 hours they aren\u2019t eating, sleeping, of using technology, but if it\u2019s safe to go outside and there\u2019s kids to play with they could have a great summer. \n\nSome young kids have a technology problem that only \u201c3 hours a day\u201d might be torture. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to address and you sound reasonable.", "NTA Dad is the issue here. You and her mother are doing a great job by trying to keep consistency, and there's nothing wrong with these rules. I think the wake time is actually really lenient, and the tablet rule is a bit strict, but those aren't detriment and are completely parenting choices. Dad is just trying to get out of actually parenting and trying to be the fun parent. It's really common and can be the demise of a child's behavior. He needs to get on board with you and his ex. Consistency really is key with children.", "NTA, but unless mom steps in and says \u201cDad you\u2019re being manipulated, here are the rules I want all of us to agree on\u201d you can\u2019t possibly win.  Either stepdaughter will resent you or you will resent her and your husband.", "NTA. Good job you. It\u2019s great to support the same rules she has at her mother\u2019s house.", "Those are pretty much exactly the same for my 11yo son during the summer\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is beyond reasonable and generous for an 11\u2019year old", "\n\nNTA. It\u2019s not healthy to let her stay up all night/spend all day on electronics. I\u2019d do things with her so she has some fun memories -bike rides, the park, board games, read-alouds", "NTA. You, my dear, have a husband problem.", ">these are the same rules she has at her mothers house\n\n>these were not set out of spite, they were set for consistency\n\nI'm pragmatic, based on this it's very simple: NTA", "I mean if your husband doesn\u2019t agree yes you should have a discussion with him about changing some of the rules as he sees fit but she should practice proper hygiene and such but ultimately it should be your husband\u2019s decision", "Your rules are very reasonable for an 11 year old and even the Mom agrees. SD just wants to push boundaries as all kids do. Dad is the real AH here. He is creating problems when there are none. NTA", "Rules 1-4 seem extreme to me but not unreasonable. Five and six are non negotiable. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour husband seems to want to establish a good cop/bad cop dynamic here. He likely wasn\u2019t expecting you to talk to his ex about it and thought you would just give in so he could maintain his good cop image and paint her as the bad cop.", "Nta you and her mother and father have agreed to maintain the same rules across board", "NTA. That\u2019s all more generous than I am with my kids, who are 9 and 11. And since this mirrors the rules at Mom\u2019s house, it\u2019s just good parenting. Your husband should be working with his ex to provide their daughter with a stable, responsible upbringing. \nLike others have said, he\u2019s trying to be \u201cfun dad\u201d. Good luck if you decide to have kids with him.", "NTA\n\nThis is all basic stuff that you're asking.", "Yta, the rules are fine but you're not the parent. Your job is as wife to support your husband not as parent,  this kid already has two active parents.  If/ when your husband doesn't parent his kid at all and she's unclean etc etc you don't have a step daughter problem you have a husband problem, deal with your husband problem.", "I think you should have a conversation with your husband privately about this to make sure everyone's needs are met. Let him know your reasoning for each rule. Keep in mind, it should only be a rule if it affects you and/or your house (things like electronic time presumably don't affect you, but something like when she wakes up might affect you if you are making meals at a certain time). You and your husband should come up with a set of rules together that honors everyone's needs/wants.\n\nIf your husband has refused to work with you on this, then ESH. Otherwise, a gentle YTA, and I think you should be able to fix this.\n\nEdit: There can be rules about things that don't affect you (like technology use), but they should come from her dad, not from you.", "If they are the house rules at mom's - nta.\n\n...I think they are all too strict for summer/weekends but that's my take.", "So I agree that the rules are reasonable , but there are better ways to go about enforcing them. Maybe build a good relationship with your SD, the rule that\u2019s most important , that you can approach first but not laying it out as a \u201crule\u201d. Better to have a nice casual conversation and she will be more inclined to follow your advice. My niece(7) spends some time with me and stays over, if it was up to her I\u2019m sure she would stay up til 3am but around 10ish I suggest to her to go to sleep so we can wake up early and make some delicious pancakes\u2026 she just goes along with anything and I think the trick is to show something good about it. She also limits her candy consumption in her own after I explain to her how teeth can get ruined .. anyway, that\u2019s my opinion. It\u2019s all about the tone and dynamic you set", "Mild YTA. Rules 5 and 6 are fine. The rest are dumb. It\u2019s the summer. Who cares? As long as she gets back into a routine before school, why does it matter when she sleeps now?", "YTA\n\nYour DH should make rules for his kid.\n\nYou have right for your house to be clean, etc, but kid rules (like electronic time) , as opposed to house rules (like no shoes on sofa) should  be up to him. \n\nIt is real easy to be tough with a kid that is not yours.", "AH. \n\n1. You are not the only person in this relationship or this household. You do not get to make rules unilaterally wituout first doscussing those rules with the other people they affect. ESPECIALLY given that _this is not your child_.\n\n\n\n2. If a teenager is sleeping (and doesn't have depression), _it's because they need sleep_. You have arbitrarily decided that this person (whose parent you aren't) shouldn't \"sleep all day\" and that your circadian rhythm is the only one that matters, but that doesn't make either true.\n\nTeenagers need a LOT more sleep than adults and have later-set circadian rhythms. Denying _anyone_ the sleep they need causes lifelong health problems, let alone someone whose body is going through puberty.", "When you made these rules did you consult her father or did you unilaterally decide what your husband\u2019s daughter was allowed to do?", "While the rules are very reasonable, YTA. Your husband needs to be the one setting the rules for his daughter.", "YTA - bedtime/waking up rules are reasonable, basic hygiene is expected, and you should show her to clean up after herself. Everything else is absolutely not your place unless you\u2019ve had a significant role in this child\u2019s early upbringing. Sounds like you\u2019re overstepping parental boundaries to me", "At the line \u201cI\u2019m fine with this, and have absolutely zero problen with her being here\u2026\u201d I knew YTA.  Instead of embracing her as an extension of your own family (\u201cI\u2019m really glad she\u2019s here\u201d) you merely tolerate her presence (\u201cNo problem!\u201d) Children can sense when they are unwanted and I suspect these rules are designed to reinforce your own feelings.", "INFO: how much screentime do you have? ( Include checking your socials ) if it's more than she is allowed yta.\n\nDoes she have friends near you? If not, why can't she spend the start of summer just relaxing and unwinding? Still Yta", "YTA. That isn't your kid. If the dad wants to let her stay up all night or stay in her room, that is up to him. I have no idea why there was this much discussion over her being there for a week. Arguing they're the rules the has is irrelevant since she isn't at her mom's house.", "YTA. Sounds like you are too entitled and need to put rules for her because you consider the house is yours only. Or maybe yours and your husbands. If you actually accepted her as part of the family, one week together wouldn\u2019t be so harsh for you to endure and you wouldn\u2019t be making a bunch of rules for a child that\u2019s NOT YOURS. Why you need to act like you are her mom and why you have this need of showing you are in control? Let her father be her father and one week is not a long time for her to sleep late or spend the whole day in her room. It\u2019s summer and she is a teenager and it doesn\u2019t look like she feels so comfortable in your place to spend the whole day out of her room if you need to put this rule up.", "Yta except: hygeine and dinner. Who cares if she sleeps all day? Who cares if she's on her tablet? Why wouldn't she be allowed in her room all day? She's 11 not 4. She doesn't need structured playtime or required naps anymore.", "YTA. You\u2019re not a parent. You\u2019re trying to act like a parent. \n\nLet your husband do the parenting.", "YTA. You have no reason to impose these kinds of rules on a child that is not yours. Sure, they sound reasonable, but again, NOT your child. If you are giving these rules to your own child, it is ok, but understand that you are an outsider to the child-parent relationship that is at work here. Let the father and mother of the child set rules and enforce them, and figure out their differences with parenting styles, among themselves.", "YTA. Leave the kid alone. Why can\u2019t she be in her own room all day if that is where she wants to be? If something happens to organically make her want to leave her room that\u2019s great.
