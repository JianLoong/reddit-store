Good luck, op.", "\"so I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m being met with so much push back from husband and child.\"\n\nI'm conjecturing a lot here, so feel free to tell me I'm off base.\n\nBut I wonder if your husband wants to be the \"fun parent\" especially as his daughter's probably going to be showing a bit more attitude so he wants to get in her good graces early (pre-teenagers, gotta love 'em).\n\nBut if her mom is okay with the rules, he should be to. As to those who say you shouldn't be laying down the rules, it should be your husband?\n\nIt's your house too. And, as I said, you've talked to her mom so it's not like you're being dragon-stepmom and trying to take over your SD's life.\n\nWhat you've laid out are pretty basic and not harsh, imo.\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA I'm sorry but we shouldn't be encouraging children to be hermits , allowing her to have freedom and alone time is one thing and that's normal but what's an 11 year old doing up past 11pm anyway?. Also if your stepdaughters mother doesn't have a problem with the rules it just sounds like your husband is playing 'nice parent'.", "NTA - Especially since you spoke with mom. She is trying to push your boundaries. Stay strong and have dad help out.", "INFO: did you and your husband not talk about expectations beforehand?", "NTA. From all the comments, OP:\n\nDiscussed these expectations with her husband beforehand. He initially agreed.\n\nDouble-checked with SD's mom, who has primary custody. These are the same rules and expectations as at her house.\n\nHusband changed his tune the moment SD threw a tantrum in a clear (and successful) tactic to manipulate her father.\n\nOP is NTA for being a cooperative co-parent, or for trying to hold her husband to an agreement, or for enforcing some very basic rules and expectations in her house. Her husband needs to step up and be a parent, not his kid's friend.", "NTA for enforcing consistency between homes, it will greatly benefit her in the long run. The fact that your spouse is not having your back in this instance is worrying.\n\nIf the child sees that her behavior gets a positive reaction from an adult it will reinforce that behavior in her. She could interpret her dad disagreeing with you as a way to make the time she spends at your home free-reign.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke with her mom and are keeping the rules consistent. I seriously cannot understand all the Y T A votes here who think you should send the child back to her mom after a week of not having brushed her teeth or taken a shower. Gross. None of these rules are extreme or unreasonable. If Dad is unwilling to enforce the same rules she has every day in Mom's house and won't even expect his 11 y.o. to brush her teeth (eyeroll), Dad is the problem.", "INFO: Does the child consider you a parent or just dad's new wife?", "NTA None of the rules are unreasonable and you've discussed these with her Primary Carer who seems fine with it, as well as confirming the daughter has similar rules at her Mom's home.\n\nI don't see why your Husband objects to these given the above.", "NTA since the rules are the ones she has with the primary parent, were created by and in agreement with your husband and his ex, and the only reason your husband is changing his mind is age appropriate minimal pushback by his daughter.\n\nHowever, if that\u2019s the case what you have isn\u2019t an issue of rules, it\u2019s an issue with your husband\u2019s parenting. His lack of consistency and follow through are going to hurt his daughter in the long run and there\u2019s only so much you can do to minimize that as a stepparent.\n\nYou can continue to help him realize the importance healthy rules and boundaries (as well as meaning what he says) or you can accept he won\u2019t change. If the latter, think carefully if this is something you can live with.", "NTA those don\u2019t seem unreasonable to me. Especially if her mother is in agreement and the husband is too until the daughter comes around. You need to have a long conversation with him about undermining you and forcing you to be the \u201cbad\u201d cop. Eleven is still incredibly young as a gen z who grew up with unlimited electronic access I definitely will be doing something similar in terms of electronics at night. Also, 11pm is pretty late for an 11 year old I think. Maybe for summer try compromising and pushing the times back an hour or two if husband wants to be mister fun times. Consistency is important for kids and if those are the rules at moms house as well it\u2019d make sense for them to transfer over. I think a lot of the yta ppl think these are rules you are setting on your own despite you stating you made these with the bio mother and father. Dads fs the AH for putting you and BM in that situation to be the villain", "NTA, they\u2019re pretty similar to our summer rules. Except we have less screen time, no TVs in bedrooms, daily chores but no wake up time.\n\nIs there a specific issue she has? Maybe a place where you can discuss and compromise?", "NTA\n\nThat seems like excessive screen time and late nights for an 11 year old, frankly.", "NTA rules are important.", "NTA. As someone with strict parents, those are some generous rules. I don\u2019t know what you expect the kid to do for the 12 hours they aren\u2019t eating, sleeping, of using technology, but if it\u2019s safe to go outside and there\u2019s kids to play with they could have a great summer. \n\nSome young kids have a technology problem that only \u201c3 hours a day\u201d might be torture. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to address and you sound reasonable.", "NTA Dad is the issue here. You and her mother are doing a great job by trying to keep consistency, and there's nothing wrong with these rules. I think the wake time is actually really lenient, and the tablet rule is a bit strict, but those aren't detriment and are completely parenting choices. Dad is just trying to get out of actually parenting and trying to be the fun parent. It's really common and can be the demise of a child's behavior. He needs to get on board with you and his ex. Consistency really is key with children.", "NTA, but unless mom steps in and says \u201cDad you\u2019re being manipulated, here are the rules I want all of us to agree on\u201d you can\u2019t possibly win.  Either stepdaughter will resent you or you will resent her and your husband.", "NTA. Good job you. It\u2019s great to support the same rules she has at her mother\u2019s house.", "Those are pretty much exactly the same for my 11yo son during the summer\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is beyond reasonable and generous for an 11\u2019year old", "\n\nNTA. It\u2019s not healthy to let her stay up all night/spend all day on electronics. I\u2019d do things with her so she has some fun memories -bike rides, the park, board games, read-alouds", "NTA. You, my dear, have a husband problem.", ">these are the same rules she has at her mothers house\n\n>these were not set out of spite, they were set for consistency\n\nI'm pragmatic, based on this it's very simple: NTA", "I mean if your husband doesn\u2019t agree yes you should have a discussion with him about changing some of the rules as he sees fit but she should practice proper hygiene and such but ultimately it should be your husband\u2019s decision", "Your rules are very reasonable for an 11 year old and even the Mom agrees. SD just wants to push boundaries as all kids do. Dad is the real AH here. He is creating problems when there are none. NTA", "Rules 1-4 seem extreme to me but not unreasonable. Five and six are non negotiable. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour husband seems to want to establish a good cop/bad cop dynamic here. He likely wasn\u2019t expecting you to talk to his ex about it and thought you would just give in so he could maintain his good cop image and paint her as the bad cop.", "Nta you and her mother and father have agreed to maintain the same rules across board", "NTA. That\u2019s all more generous than I am with my kids, who are 9 and 11. And since this mirrors the rules at Mom\u2019s house, it\u2019s just good parenting. Your husband should be working with his ex to provide their daughter with a stable, responsible upbringing. \nLike others have said, he\u2019s trying to be \u201cfun dad\u201d. Good luck if you decide to have kids with him.", "NTA\n\nThis is all basic stuff that you're asking.", "Yta, the rules are fine but you're not the parent. Your job is as wife to support your husband not as parent,  this kid already has two active parents.  If/ when your husband doesn't parent his kid at all and she's unclean etc etc you don't have a step daughter problem you have a husband problem, deal with your husband problem.", "I think you should have a conversation with your husband privately about this to make sure everyone's needs are met. Let him know your reasoning for each rule. Keep in mind, it should only be a rule if it affects you and/or your house (things like electronic time presumably don't affect you, but something like when she wakes up might affect you if you are making meals at a certain time). You and your husband should come up with a set of rules together that honors everyone's needs/wants.\n\nIf your husband has refused to work with you on this, then ESH. Otherwise, a gentle YTA, and I think you should be able to fix this.\n\nEdit: There can be rules about things that don't affect you (like technology use), but they should come from her dad, not from you.", "If they are the house rules at mom's - nta.\n\n...I think they are all too strict for summer/weekends but that's my take.", "So I agree that the rules are reasonable , but there are better ways to go about enforcing them. Maybe build a good relationship with your SD, the rule that\u2019s most important , that you can approach first but not laying it out as a \u201crule\u201d. Better to have a nice casual conversation and she will be more inclined to follow your advice. My niece(7) spends some time with me and stays over, if it was up to her I\u2019m sure she would stay up til 3am but around 10ish I suggest to her to go to sleep so we can wake up early and make some delicious pancakes\u2026 she just goes along with anything and I think the trick is to show something good about it. She also limits her candy consumption in her own after I explain to her how teeth can get ruined .. anyway, that\u2019s my opinion. It\u2019s all about the tone and dynamic you set", "Mild YTA. Rules 5 and 6 are fine. The rest are dumb. It\u2019s the summer. Who cares? As long as she gets back into a routine before school, why does it matter when she sleeps now?", "YTA\n\nYour DH should make rules for his kid.\n\nYou have right for your house to be clean, etc, but kid rules (like electronic time) , as opposed to house rules (like no shoes on sofa) should  be up to him. \n\nIt is real easy to be tough with a kid that is not yours.", "AH. \n\n1. You are not the only person in this relationship or this household. You do not get to make rules unilaterally wituout first doscussing those rules with the other people they affect. ESPECIALLY given that _this is not your child_.\n\n\n\n2. If a teenager is sleeping (and doesn't have depression), _it's because they need sleep_. You have arbitrarily decided that this person (whose parent you aren't) shouldn't \"sleep all day\" and that your circadian rhythm is the only one that matters, but that doesn't make either true.\n\nTeenagers need a LOT more sleep than adults and have later-set circadian rhythms. Denying _anyone_ the sleep they need causes lifelong health problems, let alone someone whose body is going through puberty.", "When you made these rules did you consult her father or did you unilaterally decide what your husband\u2019s daughter was allowed to do?", "While the rules are very reasonable, YTA. Your husband needs to be the one setting the rules for his daughter.", "YTA - bedtime/waking up rules are reasonable, basic hygiene is expected, and you should show her to clean up after herself. Everything else is absolutely not your place unless you\u2019ve had a significant role in this child\u2019s early upbringing. Sounds like you\u2019re overstepping parental boundaries to me", "At the line \u201cI\u2019m fine with this, and have absolutely zero problen with her being here\u2026\u201d I knew YTA.  Instead of embracing her as an extension of your own family (\u201cI\u2019m really glad she\u2019s here\u201d) you merely tolerate her presence (\u201cNo problem!\u201d) Children can sense when they are unwanted and I suspect these rules are designed to reinforce your own feelings.", "INFO: how much screentime do you have? ( Include checking your socials ) if it's more than she is allowed yta.\n\nDoes she have friends near you? If not, why can't she spend the start of summer just relaxing and unwinding? Still Yta", "YTA. That isn't your kid. If the dad wants to let her stay up all night or stay in her room, that is up to him. I have no idea why there was this much discussion over her being there for a week. Arguing they're the rules the has is irrelevant since she isn't at her mom's house.", "YTA. Sounds like you are too entitled and need to put rules for her because you consider the house is yours only. Or maybe yours and your husbands. If you actually accepted her as part of the family, one week together wouldn\u2019t be so harsh for you to endure and you wouldn\u2019t be making a bunch of rules for a child that\u2019s NOT YOURS. Why you need to act like you are her mom and why you have this need of showing you are in control? Let her father be her father and one week is not a long time for her to sleep late or spend the whole day in her room. It\u2019s summer and she is a teenager and it doesn\u2019t look like she feels so comfortable in your place to spend the whole day out of her room if you need to put this rule up.", "Yta except: hygeine and dinner. Who cares if she sleeps all day? Who cares if she's on her tablet? Why wouldn't she be allowed in her room all day? She's 11 not 4. She doesn't need structured playtime or required naps anymore.", "YTA. You\u2019re not a parent. You\u2019re trying to act like a parent. \n\nLet your husband do the parenting.", "YTA. You have no reason to impose these kinds of rules on a child that is not yours. Sure, they sound reasonable, but again, NOT your child. If you are giving these rules to your own child, it is ok, but understand that you are an outsider to the child-parent relationship that is at work here. Let the father and mother of the child set rules and enforce them, and figure out their differences with parenting styles, among themselves.", "YTA. Leave the kid alone. Why can\u2019t she be in her own room all day if that is where she wants to be? If something happens to organically make her want to leave her room that\u2019s great.

Research however shows some interesting things about circadian rhythms of young people, especially during puberty. \n\nI think your heart is in the right place. I agree with you about discipline. I would take a somewhat different approach. By no means am I claiming to have the right answer. I just have a different perspective. Here are my thoughts. \n\nDinner is a family event, every night. SD must be up and participate in preparation. Note that on r/Cooking and other subs here and Facebook groups we get tons of 20-somethings who are on their one for the first time and can't feed themselves. Teaching kids to cook is part of parenting. I'm fully with you on helping clean up after dinner. 100%. \n\nI'd add something--anything--that helps the family every day. Half an hour helping weed a garden bed. Putting away groceries. Clean a toilet. \n\nDoing her own laundry is expected and doesn't count toward helping the family. Doing everyone's laundry and folding does count. \n\nPersonal hygiene is a must. I'm okay with showers every other day unless smell dictates more. Not brushing teeth gets real expensive real fast. Twice a day - when she gets up and when she goes to bed. I don't care if she sleeps to 4pm and goes to sleep at 4am. Brush teeth. \n\nIn my opinion, if she signs up to dinner and a family event every day you've made progress. I think if she wants to spend the whole rest of the day that's okay. I'm not big on limits on screen time. Pick the hills you want to die on. For lots of kids screens are their social network. The world evolves. \n\nYour husband is being an A H for not supporting you. You're suspect by not explicitly getting his agreement on the rules (whatever they are) before you impose them. However, he sounds like someone who goes whichever way the wind blows. You might want to get a signature on a piece of paper. You've got a difficult SD and a flaky husband. You're a little controlling. \n\nMy opinion\n\nNTA\n\nCould do better. I could be wrong. Best wishes. Hope this helps.", "NTA. Just from what you wrote here it sounds like dad may be the problem. He was willing and ready to enforce these rules with you until his daughter resisted.

You are actually going out of your way to be a good parent. The kid is being a kid. I'm not convinced your husband is an AH.

But he never supported mom's rules and fought tooth and nail to avoid giving her enough child suppport to even cover the cost of childcare,  let alone food and clothing.  \n\nWhen the parenting became easier,  as we became adults,  he didn't know how to put in the work.  He thought we'd always reach out to him,  like always.  He thought he didn't have to help us,  but figured we'd help him whenever he needed it.  Mom kept on being a good mom - offering advice,  helping us when we needed it,  visiting us wherever we lived.  Dad got bitter,  and it was largely his own fault.  He didn't have to do the fun parent stuff anymore,  and wouldn't do the serious parent stuff.  So gradually,  we became estranged because he had all sorts of expectations of us without any return at all.  When I was leaving my abuser,  mom spent a week with me,  started organizing stuff I'd need,  held me when I cried,  paid for a lawyer,  let me move in. Dad?  Showed up to help drive the truck and weaseled out halfway through the 1000 mile drive because he was close to home and wanted to get back.  Grandpa helped me finish the drive.

(Or, rather, a common natural human variation of which modern society is very unaccepting.)", "If this Kid spends Part of her Summer living with literally NO Rules, regardless If OP suffers by being present or moves Out for the duration, she will be a NIGHTMARE (on her Mom, mostly) to re-acclimate to a remotely reasonable schedule.", "There is life outside of the digital realm and the house. Generally better.", "Same with me.  And it would have been unthinkable for either of my stepparents to give me rules.  It truly can be very horrible for the kid, and people just don\u2019t get that.  I feel very sorry for her, tbh, this makes me so sad.", "Not spending all day in room is a dumb rule?", "Instead of developing rules together, the dad wasn't a part of it. It appears to be bio and step moms.  And then there is this: he initially agreed to help enforce these rules, but changed his stance at the SD\u2019s first tantrum.  She probably only spent weekends but this is for a full week.", "I have to kind of watch the bedroom one with my 11 year old also. If she starts spending too much time alone in her room, she spirals into anti socialness, and gets sassy and rude. So we have had to make the compromise that she can be in her room, but needs to keep the door open for the most part so she can still socialize with the rest of us, and I can make sure she\u2019s not sneaking too much screen time. I wish she was more of a reader, I think we would have way less issues with \u201calone in her room\u201d time.", "They get 10 or even more. They are so physically active (in a program where they are active hard from 4-7 for the youngest and 2-8 for oldest). They are absolutely exhausted. If you let your kids sit around they of course won't sleep they need exercise and recovery.", "Yikes. And you thought he was attractive enough to marry despite not actually raising his kid?", "You're right.  And even though I did it in a bad way, I was trying to point out the same thing you are: the dad isn't doing his job.  Fwiw, the dad DID agree to the rules...until he needed to enforce them, then he changed his mind.", "Because some still have a routine. We have appointments and extracurriculars.  Good sleep habits start young.", "Yes.  Calling it a \"disorder\" is quite ridiculous -- it really is just one end of the natural human spectrum.", "True and yet heavily dependent on your own personal situation \nIt\u2019s 2023 and while yes she shouldn\u2019t be on her screen all day 3 hours a day is criminally low especially if she doesn\u2019t have other interests, plus how will she communicate to her friends about meeting up and hanging out etc etc", "Nothing the guy you replied to said makes him a neckbeard.", "Mom made the rules, Dad and OP agreed to them, OP is just trying to enforce them, and Dad has done a 180 and decided to blame her because his kid isn't looking him as the \"fun no-rules dad\" anymore.", "This is something I deal with with my own husband. He just wants to have his \u201cchill time\u201d always, and doesn\u2019t have the backbone to deal with a tantrum. OP\u2019s husband seems to be similar, at least based on this. He was on board until he was called upon to enforce. Which he doesn\u2019t want to do because it\u2019s hard. When I leave town for anything, the rules fly out the window, and it pisses me off. I feel for OP.", "That was my problem too. When I stepped back from the parental role I gave my husband the space he needed to step up. Now he's the parent and I can just love on the kids. I enforce his decisions and I'll stop the kids from jumping off cliffs. This gives them an adult to talk to that is on their side and they know I'll always be there for them.", "My parents had a LOT of issues with 'alone in her room time' because they thought that about me, but I was legit an introvert and being around people too much tired me out.\n\nOP, maybe try setting standards other than no staying in her room all day? Figure out what you're trying to prevent from her staying in her room--her watching too much TV (since you already restricted the tablet), getting into trouble online/on her phone or computer (or whatever else she has), not getting exercise? You probably can't sign her up for a sport for one week but saying 'You need to eat your meals with another physical person and no electronics' could help with social concerns, 'You need to spend 30 mins-1 hour outside exercising every day' (walking the dog, riding your bike, hiking with family/friends, whatever) with health issues, etc.", "Is way too LATE? Wow. Y\u2019all run a tight ship during the summer.", "Exactly!\n\n\nIt\u2019s totally normal to set boundaries and enforce them. However, keeping your teen under strict control to the point they cannot unwind and socialize after a long day of schoolwork, not to mention making them feel as if they were little children and not teens, is just bad all around.\n\n\nMy parents had rules about being out during school week (home by 9PM) and similar rules to yours with \u201csleep or don\u2019t sleep; stay all up gaming  or don\u2019t, but if your performance suffers, there\u2019ll be consequences\u201d and what do ya know. \n\n\nI\u2019m a perfectly-well adjusted adult who never lashed out after turning 18 because there was no need. My sister is the same.\n\n\nTrust your kid to live and learn. Let them make mistakes and experience consequences. Guide them instead of controlling them every step of the way.", "8PM for weekdays is still a bitch much in my opinion. \n\n\nAt that age, I\u2019d maybe finish my schoolwork by then (school + extras + transit then dinner and homework). I can\u2019t imagine not being able to unwind after all that with my phone or a game. \n\n\nSure, be reasonable, maybe don\u2019t let him stay up till 3AM but 11PM eg sounds way more reasonable.", "This arrangement only started in the last 18 months. Prior to that there was a lot of court battles with BM. And sadly it did get thrown around a little in the last 7 months as my husband had a stroke and spent 6 weeks in hospital, I was working full time, then was on medical leave myself. We only recently started having her over nights again because we weren\u2019t in the place to take care of her properly while we were both recovering from our respective medical issues.", "I would argue that a good sleep habit is knowing when your body actually wants to sleep, and letting it sleep then. You\u2019re out here letting the rest of society dictate when you should and shouldn\u2019t sleep, instead of crafting your life to listen to and respect your body.", "Not gonna lie, school is hard. We switch him to a bedtime a couple weeks before school starts. And getting him up and going is a struggle, but that\u2019s even when he has had more than enough sleep. His body just doesn\u2019t want to be awake at 7:30! Next school year will be easier tho, as he is going to a STEAM Academy charter school that starts at 9.", "That makes sense and would be \"better\" for the kids.  It allows the parent to parent...or forces them to.   The father/husband doesn't agree with them. Both bio parents need to agree on the rules; the stepmom needs to step out and let the dad take over when the kid needs guidance.  This is completely unfair to the stepmom, bio mom. and ultimately the kid but the dad wants the kid to have \"freedom\" for the summer.", "I was a fairly introverted kid also, and would sometimes spend days in my room if I had new books to read. My daughter, on the other hand, is an extrovert who thrives on social interaction and is a happier kid when she spends more time with friends. I honestly think that\u2019s why she gets so rude when she spends too much time alone, it just isn\u2019t really her nature. Which is funny to me, as her dad is even more of a hermit than me. I\u2019ve often wondered where she gets all her energy, considering she was conceived by  the two laziest people on the planet. \ud83d\ude06", "This may be genetic!  \n\nI submitted a sample DNA to Ancestry a long time ago, to learn my roots.\n\nAncestry follows up with associating DNA with certain traits.  Examples are what kind of earwax you have, do your earlobes hang free or are they attached, are you a picky eater.\n\nOne recent trait they identified is whether you are a day person or a night owl.  They correctly said I'm a day person.  So, it is in your DNA.  \n\nOne thing is that teens tend in general to want to be up more at night, and this often changes as they mature.", "Im soooo glad my dad was a night owl. \n\nI don\u2019t think my up at 5 or 6 am mother would have ever believed me that no, mom, I am not in fact tired yet at 1 am. And no matter when I went to sleep the night before, my body will never want to get up earlier than 9am.\n\nEvery single school day was a battle. I\u2019d wake up then moan on the couch for an hour until we left. When I finally got a car it was amazing: if shower the night before and set my clothes out, I can wake up at the last possible moment.\n\nI work nights now too. I will never be a morning person.", "Yes, and sleep patterns start to change around adolescence where they start to staY up later and wake up later.  This should be understood and taken account for.  Really, the dad is the one who has to do these things because otherwise stepdaughter and stepmom will never get along.", "The point is if you don't get up until 11am, it's no wonder that you can't fall asleep before 10pm or later. You've been up too few hours.", "Then I really don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t have 50% of custody other than he doesn\u2019t want to parent, as evidenced here. He wants to get the immediate reward of bribing his daughter with no rules at the expense of her own development, instead of showing up and doing the work of parenting.", "If your husband actually wanted to be a parent, he'd have done more parenting before now. He's lazy and wants to be \"cool fun dad\" while you're the villainous evil step-mommy who does all the hard work. I think you're going to eventually regret marrying this deadbeat dad.", "Pro tip: when a man is caught up in \"court battles\" over custody years after separation or otherwise says he's being prevented from seeing his kid, 99% of the time he's a deadbeat. You're discovering now that despite a big show of fighting for custody, he's not actually interested in parenting and will never do the hard work required.", "Well we live in the real world where they have school, appointments and extracurriculars. Their body needs it's rest. I can't wait til 11 am every day to out the door. I don't even have to wake them because they are up at 6:30-7 even during  summer. My kids have no issues going to bed and waking up during school because  we keep the same schedule during summer and have kept this schedule since 2-3. Also, the step daughter's routine is exactly the same at her mom's so it's consistent.", "Wow, really? That\u2019s so interesting!", "Some of us are just night people, my daughter and I included. In the summer we both just get better sleep and are less grumpy when we stick with a little later schedule. During the school year she tosses and turns until about 11:00 anyway, and then is tired for school. So in the summer we let our bodies\u2019 natural rhythms take over, and we are both much more pleasant people.", "Starting around age 14, I stopped being able to fall asleep. I was getting up at 6 AM for school, exhausted all day, got a second wind around 8 PM and I was 100% wide awake until midnight, 1, 2 AM. No naps. Was I a nightmare in the mornings on 4 hours of sleep? Yep. Did it make a difference? Nope. I didn't/still don't drink coffee or tea, may have had soda once a month back then (more often now), no medications or anything that could justify it. Hormones just knocked and said 'this is what we're doing now'.\n\nFurther, there are actual studies on this: it's normal for teen sleep cycles to basically become delayed. <[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222804/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222804/)\\> has details, but it's known enough that there are scientific arguments for high schools to start later in the day for student health (which are constantly being ignored/refused because those kids NEED to do after school sports and watch younger siblings). \n\nSome people even \\*stay\\* with this stupid sleep schedule: I'm getting up at 5 for work now and actively forcing myself into bed at 11 PM. Every time I have more than 2 days off in a row I start instinctively staying up until midnight or 1 AM. Some people are just wired this way, and at 11, it's possible she's heading into that.", "If we were to actually address that though, a bedtime of 10pm *is* completely ridiculous, you're absolutely right. But the solution for night people *isn't* to force them to wake up at 7am on Saturday for a brisk jog, it's to let them drift off at like 2am so they get 9 hours of sleep more naturally. Policing that is inconvenient, but then so is having a child in the first place.", "it's dumb as hell though, as a parent I don't sit there  and monitor when my kids wake up. I don't make rules about when they should wake up either. it's weird. you already are  deciding when they sleep.\n\nthat being said I see no problem at all being more relaxed about the process such as instead of telling them hey you can't do this, just fucking wake them up? like \"hey Carl, time to wake up we have errands to run\"", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I live in the real world too, buddy. I\u2019m a construction manager, my wife a college professor. My child goes to public school, does sports, swimming, horse back riding. That\u2019s great that you and your children have the same early riser circadian rhythms. Im sure it works well for you. Im not here telling you to force your kids to stay up late and sleep in late, am I? As I said before, it is a proven fact that different people have different circadian rhythms, which was evolutionarily beneficial.", "Depends. They said you edited your comment into OK from comments about calming down before they blocked you. Did you?\n\nBecause if you did, you do come across badly in this.", "I\u2019m the same way with late bed times. Nyquil + melatonin gummies are what get me to a normal bed time.", "Yes but when you have to be up at 6 am and out the door at 7:00, your kid can't stay up to mid night and wake up when they feel like it.", "Okay. Where did OP say they have to be out of the house at 7? You\u2019re projecting your reality onto others."]}
