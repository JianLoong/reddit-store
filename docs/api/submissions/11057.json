We've been together for 5 years, got engaged in 2021 and married in 2022 (January winter wedding, was gorgeous and small with only close friends, my maternal grandparents and my wife's mom) I am the first grandchild/cousin to get married on both sides of the family.\n\nI'm very feminine and my wife is more masculine, but both of us are very much queer and in love. My wife is very open about being intersex. Her voice is deeper and she has surplus testosterone, but she identifies with she/they pronouns and rejects male identification on any grounds. She has told me that even if they were cis, they would still dress and alter their appearance to be more masc.\n\nAfter my extended family met my wife for the first time they extensively called them \"he.\" (we understand people make mistakes but this was deliberate) It hurt my wife deeply, so I stopped bringing her around and only interacted with my family when necessary. My maternal grandparents were the exception and love her very much, my grandpa and them have the same sense of humour and I love watching them interact. The rejection of my wife's identity is what caused me not to invite any other family members to my wedding.\n\nLast month my wife posted pictures of our wedding to Instagram and posted about how our anniversary is special, telling me how much she loves me and is looking forward to many more anniversaries in the future. My younger sister, who I didn't know followed me, saw them and showed my parents and extended family, who subsequently blew up my phone for weeks about not inviting them to my milestone and how my \"husband\" must have brainwashed me.\n\nI told them that this attitude was why I didn't invite them because their presence made my partner uncomfortable. I thought it was cut and dry and over with. But my wife removed the post anyway due to some nasty comments.\n\nSo I wrote this email and mass-sent it to all of my relatives:\n\nTo all of whom did not attend my wedding,\n\nYour refusal to accept my wife as she is, was what prevented you all from receiving an invitation. (grandma) and (grandpa) attended because they were able to recognize my wife for who she is and love her for her. If you did not receive an invitation, it was because you have either: a.) insulted my wife by calling her pronouns she does not identify with on purpose, b.) calling my wife my \"friend\" instead of my girlfriend or partner when we were dating. or c.) have expressed homophobic views in the past. Please do not call her names or drag us online when it is your behaviour that got you in this mess.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOP\n\nMy entire family is calling me an asshole. My wife is saying she could have toughed it out for one day, and my entire family is angry that I didn't invite them. I just feel horrible about cutting them out of such an important milestone in the family and I feel like I did something wrong.

Them disrespecting your wife is them not having enough respect or love for you. They're just mad they couldn't make a scene at your wedding.", "NTA. Your family\u2019s continued antics prove your point. You were 100% correct in leaving them off the invite list. Don\u2019t let their manipulative tactics and guilt-trips get to you. \n\nBelated Happy Anniversary to you and your wife!", "I think it\u2019s weird that you feel people owe other people invitations to a very personal and intimate occasion. Weddings are not about other people it\u2019s about the couple getting married, the reception is more so for everyone, but still the main focus is the couple. \n\nThe reason you get invited is because the couple wants you there to witness and experience their proclamation of love for each other(vows and the ceremony part). \n\nNot everybody should have access to that non the less family members that don\u2019t make an active effort to respect each other\u2019s partner? \n\nIt\u2019s not by law to owe someone an invitation to your event. It\u2019s not even required to go, that\u2019s what the RSVP is for- some of them come with a check box option to see who will be attending or not.", "hope your younger sister is better than the rest.", "Lol nope", "oh shoot.  Sorry to read that.", "NTA because it's literally your wedding your decision, point blank period. Are there consequences to that? of course, just like there are consequences to everything. Congrats by the way to you and your wife!!", "NTA. BRAVO, and congratulations on your marriage! May you have many more years of happiness and joy, without those homophobic schmucks bringing you down!", "NTA. They shot themselves in the foot. It is their fault if it goes gangrene on them.\n\nCongrats to the two of you! <3", "NTA. Good riddance.", "NTA good on you.", "NTA. Your family are major assholes. You did right in keeping your joyous celebration limited to those guests who were happy for you both and who validated your union. Sadly, our immediate families can be the most hurtful at times; and this was such a time. Your spouse is wrong, however, in declaring she could have \"toughed it out\" for a day. Why should they have to do so? It's as much her celebration as it's yours. The point is the deed was done, the wedding is past. Don't engage any further on the matter. Spare your household any of this poison leeching into your marriage.", "NTA.\n\nYou tell your wife you love them too much to let her endure constant abuse. Both she and you deserve better than this kind of treatment.", "If OP's wife can \"just tough it out\" for a day, OP's family can \"just tough it out\" for a day just the same.", "My wife uses both she and they pronouns indiscriminately :)", "NTA absolutely, but I just want to let you know as a genderfluid individual, your usage of both the she and they pronouns throughout your post is wonderful!

They chose to use he/him. They chose to be as cruel as possible because they don't approve of OP's wife's body. That is cruel. It is not \"getting used\" to something. It's choosing to be mean. \n\nOP is being plenty fair not wanting to be in contact with people who are cruel to her wife.", "Yes... that's what she/they pronouns are... They use both...", "...she/her and they/them. You can use more than one set of pronouns.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure your wife could have \u201ctoughed it out\u201d because she sounds like a strong, wonderful person. But that\u2019s kind of irrelevant. There is no good reason for her to do so. Your family aren\u2019t people worth having in her life or in your life either. You made the right decision protecting her and yourself, and filling your life only with people who deserve it.\n\nLike, if you stop and think about it, do you really think pleasing your horrible family would have been worth ruining your wife\u2019s wedding day? Making her miserable?", "You could point out that you have been married for a year and they don't interact with you enough to notice.  That's on them not you.  Block them and enjoy your wife. Congratulations \ud83c\udf8a", "NTA.\n\nUnasked for suggestion: You might want to swap \"wife\" and \"girlfriend\" for \"partner\" if they are nonbinary. It won't help with people who are going to treat you two poorly no matter what, but it might help people who want to get it right, but would tend to associate wife with she and her.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife seems maybe a bit too kind for her own good. Why should they have to \"tough it out\" on their own wedding day?", "NTA.  Your wife should not have to \u201ctough it out.\u201d  It\u2019s her day too.  You did the right thing.", "Nta. If they cannot treat a new family member kindly then they n Ed to take a flying fuck in a rolling donut.", "My spouse likes it when I call her my wife. They have asked me to call them my wife.", "Yeah, I figured that you were respecting their wishes. I just didn't know if you guys had thought through that it might lead to them being gendered by people whose intentions aren't malicious.", "They use she/they pronouns", "So they insist on denying her gender and your sexuality in one fell swoop, eh? NTA", "NTA - I am a transman. I \u201ctoughed it out\u201d for far too long. Now if anyone doesn\u2019t accept me as I am, they are out of my life. And if ANYONE said anything against my wife, they would not get a second chance, they would be immediately gone for good. My wife had to be the one to stand up for me and correct people for me until I finally understood that I had the right to expect to be respected. Pronouns are not optional. A person\u2019s identity is not optional. Either they get on board, or they are out.\n\nKeep defending her until you can get her to recognize her own worth and she can do it herself. I promise you she will thank you!", "NTA. Just block the whole mess of them and have a good life. Congratulations!", "NTA - It's your (both of you) milestone, not your family's. If they can't be civil, don't include them in any part of it. I hope you're considering reducing your contact with them. You owe them nothing and they obviously don't care enough for you to behave. I cut off contact with half of my siblings, and I've never regretted it.", "Your wedding is supposed to be about love and commitment.\n\nDid both of you feel loved?

Ever.\n\nCongratulations!", ">My wife is saying she could have toughed it out for one day\n\nI don't doubt that at all, but there is no reason she should have had to \"tough it out\".\n\nYou allowed your day to be about YOU, Nobody had to be uncomfortable, nobody had to walk on egg shels.\n\nInviting them would have made your wedding less perfect than it was.\n\nYou made the right choice, you stood up for your wife, you stood up for yourself, you stood up for your relationship and you should be really fucking proud of that.\n\n>my entire family is angry that I didn't invite them.\n\nTough shit, Don't be an AH and you won't get treated like an AH, Life can be pretty simple sometimes.\n\nNTA at all and HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!

You are not wrong to put your wife's needs first, particularly in the face of such rudeness and disrespect.\n\nYour email was fantastic.", "The fact that your wife could have toughed it out for a day doesn't mean that she should have done so. She shouldn't have had to, and I'm glad to see you had the respect and decency to ensure that she didn't. \n\nYour wedding is a special day, a day that honors and celebrates your commitment of joining two individuals into one coupling. \n\nTwo unique individuals.\n\nYour family, apart from your grandparents, are toxic af. In keeping with past, and to this day current, behaviors with regard to your wife, they would have intentionally created several awkward and uncomfortable mini-occasions throughout your special day to disrespect and degrade both your wife and your relationship. The occasion would have been barely tolerable, and both you and your wife deserve better than that.\n\nThey are butt-hurt that they were not considered acceptable invitees to an occasion that honors someone they find unacceptable and are inconsiderate to. That's their problem. They are toxic, and the less your wife is subjected to them and their continual bouts of assholery (and yourself, for that matter), the healthier for you both and the better for your marriage.\n\nExcluding them from the wedding was truly a first class decision, and is the biggest factor that ensured you both were able to start off married life with a beautiful celebration. \n\nCongratulations on your nuptials, may you enjoy many decades of vibrant health and optimal happiness together.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThe wedding is for you.

Then I ask them to politely correct me every time, because I really am trying. Most are very gracious about it, and appreciate the effort. The few that aren't, I don't need in my life anyway. If old people like me and your grandparents can do it, so can your younger family members. NTA.\n\nDo you get homophobic shit from them for being queer?
